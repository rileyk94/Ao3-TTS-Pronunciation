# AO3 Phonetic Spelling for Microsoft Edge TTS
Converts names and unique words in various fandoms to phonetic spelling for 
microsoft edge's tts feature. Currently only Naruto is complete, Harry Potter,
Star Wars, Fire Emblem Three Houses, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer are in progress.

I'm planning on adding a GUI in the future, for better usability. also test mobile 
feasibility.

## How To Use
Download an html from AO3 and place it in the "original" folder.
Run the program, selecting the correct file from the list, then choosing which
fandoms you want to use. you can include multiple fandoms for crossovers.
type the fandoms exactly as they are listed. once you're ready type "done".

the program will place a converted html file in the "fics" folder. Just open it 
in edge and run "read aloud". 

### Adding custom conversions:
you can edit the existing excel files, or add your own custom ones. To create your
own, open an excel file, and place the original word in the first column and 
the new word, spelled phonetically, in the second column. make sure "custom" is 
in the file name, so that the file will be located in the correct place. save 
the file to the "fandom_xlsx" folder. When you run the program, your custom conversion
should be there.
