<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>For many people, the mercenary lifestyle seemed like a fantasy. Being able to travel to and fro, paid riches from nobles, and perhaps even save a lover to be. In reality, it was not like that. Not at all.</p><p> </p><p>Sure you would be traveling, but oftentimes it would mean not having a place to truly call home. Nobles may hire you, but they're just as likely to cut you loose if it'd profit them, and the chances of saving someone who'd fall for you wasn't exactly an everyday occurrence. </p><p> </p><p>Worst of all, sometimes you don't have enough food to go around. </p><p> </p><p>Hence why young Byleth Eisner was currently hunting, having volunteered to get some food as rations were running low. Normally her father wouldn't let her get so far away from the camp without him, but even he had to admit that his silent daughter would be able to track a prey without alerting it. </p><p> </p><p>With soft, even breaths, the young mercenary pulled her bowstring taut, keeping her eyes on the deer before her. The wild animal was completely unaware of who was stalking it as it grazed in the fields. As soon as it lifted its head, an arrow would fly through its neck– </p><p> </p><p>A loud rustling from the other side of the Deer caught its attention, making it run as Byleth let the arrow loose in hopes of hitting it–</p><p> </p><p>"GAH!"</p><p> </p><p>…That did not sound like a deer. </p><p> </p><p>Staying quiet, Byleth moved her way to the bush where the scream came from, and parted it to be greeted with the sight of a girl with purple hair. One who was currently lying on the ground and bleeding from the arrow pierced into her shoulder, having seemingly gone unconscious from the pain. </p><p> </p><p>Hm.</p><p> </p><p>Shouldering her bow, Byleth reached down to pick up the girl, and trudge her way back to the camp. After all, her father told her if there was a problem, best bring it to him. </p><p> </p><p>Granted, he probably never expected a problem to be a bleeding unconscious girl that his own daughter had shot. </p><p> </p><p>Thankfully all his years as a mercenary…well, they didn't exactly prepare him for this moment, but they were enough to keep him cool as he took the young girl to get her patched up. And by that, he meant taking her to the group's medic, who saw to her without any problems, aside from some exasperation at being called up for something “so easy”. </p><p> </p><p>Even so, he made sure to stay nearby, keeping an eye on the girl as she rested in the infirmary tent after being patched up, especially as he noted some things about her. Age wise, she seemed about the same age as Byleth, and while it seemed she probably hadn't eaten recently, he could see the calluses on her hands telling him she was at least used to wielding a weapon. Add in the fact that she also had a knife meant that she was a hunter, or even a mercenary. </p><p> </p><p>Jeralt couldn't help but frown at the thought. Sure, Byleth might technically be one as well, but that was because he had trained her to protect herself, and he couldn't just leave her anywhere. This girl on the other hand…he didn't know what her circumstances were, but he was never fond of young fighters having to risk their lives. </p><p> </p><p>“What in the world has your life been like…” he muttered under his breath, watching the strange girl.</p><p> </p><p>He considered leaving. </p><p> </p><p>At the end of the day, the girl wasn’t his. He already had one kid to take care of and whoever this kid was, she wasn’t any of his business. But it was his daughter who put an arrow through her shoulder. So he stayed until she stirred awake.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes fluttered open slowly, blearily, before shooting open when she seemed to realize she was somewhere unfamiliar.</p><p> </p><p>“Easy there,” Jeralt soothed, raising a hand to her. Not touching, just close by…He probably shouldn’t be treating a scared kid like a startled horse, but in the absence of experience, he fell back on what was familiar. “How are you feeling?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” The girl had purple eyes, similar in shade to her bright hair. It was a surprise Byleth hadn’t managed to spot her, even in the forest. Maybe he should get her eyes checked? “...where am I and who are you?”</p><p> </p><p>That was more direct than he expected. There was suspicion in the girl’s gaze, but it looked like she was sizing him up. It occurred to him that he should’ve taken the knife from her belt.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re in my camp. I’m Jeralt, the leader of Jeralt’s Mercenaries.” Not for the first time, he considered whether he should rename his band into something less self-referential, before discarding the thought. “What’s your name?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a mercenary?” Weirdly, the girl brightened up. She suddenly sat up with a smile on her face, one that barely faltered from the leftover sting of her healed wound, even if he did hear her hiss through her teeth. “My name is Shez, sir! I’m best with using a sword, but I am capable of using any weapon and I can read and write! I can also cook and clean if you need it, and I am very cheap to hire! I only need three meals a day and somewhere to sleep, and I promise I will work for you very faithfully!”</p><p> </p><p>“...What?”</p><p> </p><p>Her smile almost faltered. “I-I can work for two meals a day! No lower!”</p><p> </p><p>“That…kid, what are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>She stared at him, then tried another smile. “You said you’re a mercenary, so I want to work for you! I’ve done it before, I know how it works!”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve done it before?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah! Three times! I’m experienced!”</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt didn’t know what to do with that information. “Alright, slow down. How old are you? Ten?”</p><p> </p><p>The girl pouted. “I’m not ten, I’m…twelve? Twelve, probably…”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t know how old you are?” He tried not to sigh. “How does a kid work for three mercenary companies before she’s even fifteen?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, easy. My parents died, then my mom died, and the village says I can’t have the house, so I gotta get money and I met a guy named Dieter and he said I could help his group because I can read and he can’t and then he got hanged so I joined the people that hanged him for crimes and then they all got eaten by a giant wolf so I wandered for a while–”</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt let the girl ramble. It was easier than asking more questions. He was so used to his own quiet, unemotive daughter that he had no idea how to interact with more…energetic kids.</p><p> </p><p>As if summoned by his thoughts, Byleth chose then to come into the tent.</p><p> </p><p>She stared at the new girl, Shez, for a second, before directing her attention back to him. “Papa.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey kid,” he greeted, letting his daughter sit beside him.</p><p> </p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p> </p><p>“That…” It took him a second to realize Shez was the one that asked. “...This is Byleth, my daughter. She’s the one that found you.”</p><p> </p><p>He decided to be diplomatic and avoid mentioning just how Byleth found her.</p><p> </p><p>“I shot you with an arrow.” Byleth, however, didn’t understand his plan at all.</p><p> </p><p>“THAT WAS YOU!?” Kids could be loud, apparently. Had it really been that long since he interacted with a non-quiet child?</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. You were behind the deer.”</p><p> </p><p>"I was hunting that deer!" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…You should be quieter when hunting." </p><p> </p><p>"I was being quiet!" Jeralt quickly realized he should step in. </p><p> </p><p>"Look, Shez, if you need a place to stay for a bit, I don't mind letting you stick around till we get to town." Before she could argue, he raised a hand. "For now, why don't we get you something to eat?" </p><p> </p><p>Based on the loud growl her stomach let out, she agreed with the idea. </p><p> </p><p>"Th-Thank you Sir!" Well, she was polite at least. Even if she kept glaring at Byleth for an understandable reason. Hm, he just remembered that someone still needed to go hunting later since Byleth hadn't actually brought any food back… </p><p> </p><p>And, well, while the food at the camp wasn't bad by any means, the young kid acted like it was cooked by a royal chef with how eagerly she ate what he brought her.</p><p> </p><p>"S-So, does this mean I'm hired?" Shez asked when she had finished eating, to which Jeralt sighed in response. </p><p> </p><p>"Is she joining?" Byleth asked, glancing up to her father. </p><p> </p><p>"Look, I'm not about to hire a child mercenary, but if you want to make yourself useful, I can give you some chores." </p><p> </p><p>"Th-Thank you sir!" </p><p> </p><p>"Don't mention it, but try to get some rest first okay? I'd hate for your injury to get worse." Especially since it was his kid who had caused it. </p><p> </p><p>"Sir, yes, Sir!" Jeralt wasn't sure if he should be glad she knew how to 'properly' respond, but he left it at that as he got up to leave with Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"...how long is she staying?" his daughter asked after they had left the tent. </p><p> </p><p>"Just for a few days, if we're lucky enough we might find someone to take her in. As is, I'd rather not let someone who already joined three mercenary gangs at such a young age wander on her own." </p><p> </p><p>"Is it bad that I'm also a mercenary?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, no. I mean, you're not really a mercenary, I'm just training you to defend yourself, is all." </p><p> </p><p>"Are you going to train her then?" </p><p> </p><p>"No. She's injured for one, and I don't plan on keeping her around for long." </p><p> </p><p>"But shouldn't she know how to defend herself?" </p><p> </p><p>Jeralt couldn't help but let out an exasperated sigh. He couldn't believe it. Here he was, Jeralt the Blade Breaker, the strongest mercenary in Fódlan, and he couldn't even win an argument with his kid. The fact that Byleth was even arguing was throwing him off. Kid usually just went with whatever he did.</p><p> </p><p>"Fine, I'll teach her some things, but don't expect her to stick around." </p><p> </p><p>If only Jeralt knew how wrong he would be. </p>

  <p>"Hey…has anyone else noticed that the Captain has a kid around?" a mercenary asked one day after they had set up camp, whispering to one of his fellow sellswords while they relaxed after the day's march. </p><p> </p><p>"What? Of course he has a kid around, that’s his daughter. Are you that oblivious?" </p><p> </p><p>"I know about Byleth! I meant the other girl, the one with the purple hair. You know, the one he keeps making do chores?"</p><p> </p><p>“...” The second mercenary tilted her head in thought. “...” It was a long thought. “...Oh yeah!”</p><p> </p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that is weird. Has he always had two kids?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, of course–Wait, is she his kid?”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably, right? Why would he have a random kid around the camp?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know, maybe she’s the new chore girl or something.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would the captain hire a chore girl? He has a daughter, he can make her do chores.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, that’s what I’m saying.”</p><p> </p><p>The second mercenary paused. “...What were you saying again?”</p><p> </p><p>“I…no, hold on, what was I…I had a point, what was it?” The first mercenary furrowed his brow and crossed his arms over his chest. “...Right! What’s with the new girl! That’s what I was saying!”</p><p> </p><p>“What new girl?” a third mercenary asked while walking by, leading to a further confused conversation.</p><p> </p><p>Still, Shez’s presence had received some notice from the mercenaries in Jeralt’s camp. Not much, given most of the sellswords had better things to do than wonder about a random child in their midst, but still some notice.</p><p> </p><p>For a mercenary in Fodlan, having a family wasn’t particularly unusual. Many soldiers-for-hire worked to support family members back in their hometowns, after all. It was slightly unusual to have a child present in a mercenary camp, given the inherent danger of the lifestyle, but the mercs under Jeralt’s command had gotten used to Byleth. It helped that the captain’s daughter was a very quiet, unobtrusive child who never really interacted with anyone aside from her father unless prompted. </p><p> </p><p>Shez was not like that.</p><p> </p><p>Shez seemed to go out of her way to interact with the mercs, asking them if they needed any help cleaning their gear, helping carry supplies to and fro, even staring quite intensely at any sparring matches going on. So it came to no surprise that word kept spreading around about the new kid. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you think she's his kid?" a mercenary asked while he watched the young girl cleaning clothes. </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe?" </p><p> </p><p>"Neither of them look like him though. And they also don't look like each other." </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe they have different moms?" another suggested. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, they most definitely do, but what does that matter?" </p><p> </p><p>"Just thinking, Captain used to be from the Knights of Seiros, yeah?" At his fellow mercs’ nods, the first one continued. "And he also used to live at Garreg Mach, where the central church is, right? Both of which he doesn't want to go near?" </p><p> </p><p>"Just get on with your point." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm getting there! What I'm trying to say is…maybe he was married to someone over in the Central Church, but then he had an affair." </p><p> </p><p>“What? The captain’s from the Central Church?” a fourth mercenary walking by with a box in his arms asked, prompting immediate shushing from his fellows.</p><p> </p><p>“Not too loud! Captain Jeralt doesn’t like people talking about his past.”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably because of the affair,” the first mercenary said.</p><p> </p><p>“What! There was an affair??”</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t know there was an affair,” the second merc contradicted, though the third looked thoughtful.</p><p> </p><p>“He is really weird about church stuff. But would he have an affair? He doesn’t seem like the type.”</p><p> </p><p>“You never know,” the first pointed out, “There’s some reason why he doesn’t talk about his time at the church unless he’s ten cups in.”</p><p> </p><p>“...can priests even get married?” the fourth asked. The trio of chatty mercs stared at him for a moment, before turning to each other again in a unanimous decision to ignore him.</p><p>Not that it dissuaded him as he stood nearby, piping in occasionally as they continued. </p><p> </p><p>"So, let's say that the Captain did have an affair, why is the other kid here now?" </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe something happened with the mom? If she wasn't that rich, maybe she couldn't afford to keep her around." </p><p> </p><p>"Do nuns get paid alot?" </p><p> </p><p>"Still, even if she couldn't keep her kid, wouldn't it be safer to give her to an orphanage?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well you know how the captain is with the first kid, could be he didn't want to give her up." </p><p> </p><p>"Does he actually care though? Girl has only been here for a few days, and he's been making her do chores the entire time." </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe the mom is dead, and that's why he had to take her in." </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know, I don’t see the captain treating a kid of his as a chore girl. You know how protective he is of little Byleth.”</p><p> </p><p>“Byleth isn’t that little anymore. He’s been having her help out more.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fishing doesn’t count as helping.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hunting does though–”</p><p> </p><p>“Fishing completely counts! Fish is great!”</p><p> </p><p>“Agreed with the new guy, fish is good–”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you idiots doing?”</p><p> </p><p>The quartet paused in their discussion, then looked to a new addition to their gabbing gaggle. “Oh hey Healer. Hey, you know the new kid?”</p><p> </p><p>The medic raised her eyebrow. “Do you mean Shez?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah her, purple hair girl, the tiny one.”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s actually pretty tall for her age.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, sure, whatever. Do you know anything about her?”</p><p> </p><p>“I know the captain brought her in with an arrow in her shoulder. Aside from that though, she’s in good health, if a little underfed,” the medic explained, not noticing the looks the first and second mercenaries gave each other, “What are you all even chatting about anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just if the new girl is the captain’s kid or not.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Huh. I don’t think so. Are you taking bets?”</p><p> </p><p>“We weren’t, but we could be.”</p><p> </p><p>“Five gold on not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, I’ll make a note of that,” the third mercenary concluded, before turning back to his fellows. Who were back to whispering again.</p><p> </p><p>“I guarantee it, the mother was killed and that’s why Jeralt took Shez in.”</p><p> </p><p>“But why? Was it some kind of assassination?”</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t make sense, you can’t assassinate commoners. Nobles get assassinated, commoners get murdered.”</p><p> </p><p>“What if she was noble? Oh! Or what if it was Jeralt’s church wife! She could have tracked them down, used church assassins!”</p><p> </p><p>“The church doesn’t have assassins…Does it?”</p><p> </p><p>“We could ask the captain. Hey Captain!”</p><p> </p><p>The three mercenaries went stiff, all looking at the fourth member of their cohort, who was waving over towards Jeralt. The captain of their band glanced up from the log book he was writing in and raised an eyebrow. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Does the church have assass–Mfh!”</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt’s eyebrow remained raised as he watched one of the newer mercs get tackled by two of his seniors. “...Does the church have what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Um, captain, sir!” He glanced down as Shez stood at attention. The kid saluted. “The clothes are clean and now drying, sir! Um, hanging up to dry! Near the–It’s at the pole–”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t need to give me a full report every time, Shez. But, ah, thanks. Why don’t you go play with Byleth for a while?” Jeralt knew Byleth didn’t go out of her way to interact with other kids, but she should hang around someone her age during her freetime. At least, he was pretty sure she should. If nothing else she needed a break from training. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, Captain, Sir!" Shez saluted again, before heading over to where Byleth was swinging a wooden sword. </p><p> </p><p>"...Hm, maybe he just found her and decided to keep her around so his kid would have a friend?" the second mercenary suggested while still keeping the fourth one pinned to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>"Would that count as kidnapping?" the third one asked.</p><p> </p><p>"...Captain wouldn't do that, right?" And before that specific thread could be continued, a loud yelp could be heard. Looking over at the sound, they spotted Shez on the ground, clutching her head with a wooden sword at her side, with Byleth standing over her. The latter of whom had seemingly hit her possible-sister on the head. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, no sparring if no one is keeping an eye on you two!" Jeralt said, taking the sword from Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"Right, guess that means I'm up," the healer said, pushing herself up to check on Shez.</p><p> </p><p>"Hm…kinda seems like she's not a fan of the new kid," the first merc noted. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, she doesn't really seem to like anyone really." </p><p> </p><p>"True, but also, maybe she doesn't like her cause she's an affair kid. That kinda stuff can ruin a family." </p><p> </p><p>“Wait, but we’ve never seen Byleth’s mother around. Doesn’t that mean the family’s already ruined?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a rough way to think of things. I was raised by my dad on his own and I turned out fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re choking out the new guy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, crap, didn’t realize.” The second merc got off of the less-than-conscious fourth.</p><p> </p><p> "...I'm not helping you carry him," the first mercenary said. </p><p> </p><p>"Shit, ah, guess I'll need to make it up to him…hey do any of you know his name?" </p><p> </p><p>"Man, I don't don't know your name, why would I know his?" </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, really?" </p><p> </p><p>"Why would I?" the third merc asked with a quirked eyebrow, "I'm an archer, so unless you're helping me support everyone else, I don't especially know anyone."</p><p> </p><p>"Huh…guess that makes sense, I tend to be near the front," the first mercenary responded. </p><p> </p><p>"Same, though I'm part of the mounted squad, the most you'll get out of me is me paying enough attention to not run you over,” the second merc joked as he lifted up the unconscious new guy. </p><p> </p><p>"Gee, thanks pal." Huffing, the first merc looked back over at the captain and his kids, where the Captain was currently telling Byleth not to whack the new girl if she didn't have any armor on. Both kids were listening along, with the purple-haired girl seeming weirdly invested in whatever the captain was saying.</p><p> </p><p>Hm…maybe he could start a betting pool on if the cap did have an affair?</p>

  <p>Shez had to admit, while it wasn't exactly what she was expecting, she did find it nice to work for Jeralt's Mercenaries. Sure, some of the mercs were weird, but the food was nice, and having an actual tent to sleep under was even better. Though there was one big oddity; namely that of Captain Jeralt’s kid, Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn't sure what was up with the blue-haired girl, but she hardly ever talked and most of the time she did, it was to her dad. </p><p> </p><p>She was also very strong. Sure, she wasn't much of a match for any of the adults, but Shez couldn't even land a single hit on her! And, she wasn't sure why, but that really irked her! A part of Shez couldn't help but want to win against the strange girl.</p><p> </p><p>Hm, was this like the destined rival thing her mom used to tell her about in those stories? Which, if that was the case, wow, she had a destined rival! </p><p> </p><p>“Hey Byleth!” Shez called out to attract the attention of her newly found foe, “You’re my destined rival!”</p><p> </p><p>“...Okay,” Byleth replied. Then she turned back to continue setting up the training dummies some of the older mercenaries used.</p><p> </p><p>Actually, now that Shez was thinking about it, shouldn’t she be helping with that too?</p><p> </p><p>Heading on over, Shez held the training dummy as Byleth made sure it was properly secured. </p><p> </p><p>"You know, you could at least be a bit more excited about being rivals," Shez said as they moved onto the next dummy. </p><p> </p><p>"...What's a destined rival?" </p><p> </p><p>"Huh? You really don't know what that is?" Shez asked, getting a blank stare in return. "Doesn’t your dad read you stories?" </p><p> </p><p>"Should he?" </p><p> </p><p>"Uh…well, I guess he doesn't have to. Still, if you're going to be my rival, you should know your stuff!" At Byleth's stare, she continued, striking what she thought was a heroic pose. It involved a lot of pointing, first at the sky, then at Byleth. “And I shall teach you!”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm, we need to work on you being excited…Hey does your dad–I mean, does Captain Jeralt have any books to read from? That might make things easier.”</p><p> </p><p>It was hard to tell if Byleth was thinking about the question or not, but Shez was patient! Well, mostly. She might’ve given Byleth a poke in the side when she took too long. “Mm. Don’t do that.”</p><p> </p><p>"You could at least say you don't know instead of staying quiet." Byleth just stared silently at her in response. "Right, we can ask him later. All you need to know is that it means we're gonna be making each other stronger!" </p><p> </p><p>"But I'm already stronger than you." </p><p> </p><p>"Th-That's just for now! If I keep training, I'm sure I'll be able to beat you one day! Besides, I haven't even used magic in our fights yet." </p><p> </p><p>"You can use magic?" Oh? That seemed to have gotten her interested…at least, Shez thought so since Byleth's eyes opened a bit. </p><p> </p><p>"That I can, my mom taught me!" Well, she taught her a spell, but it was still something. </p><p> </p><p>"Can you show me?" </p><p> </p><p>“You bet I can!” Shez smiled brightly, then tried to think back on her mother’s lessons. She was pretty sure she said something about using tomes to safely channel magic but…eh, it would probably be safe. Grinning, she brought her hand up, aiming at the training dummy, and began to focus as a white sigil began to form in front of her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Shez would soon come to learn the importance of using tomes when you weren't that used to magic as the sigil abruptly broke, sending Shez backwards as it did. </p><p> </p><p>"Ugh…that's never happened before." Shez said, slowly getting up. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you okay?" She heard Byleth ask her. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah I'm good-..." Shez stopped talking the instant she saw a trail of blood leaking from Byleth’s forehead. "A-Are you okay?!”</p><p> </p><p>She got up and rushed over to Byleth, who regarded her with her usual blank look. Which might be a bad thing, since Shez vaguely remembered head injuries being bad injuries."Hm?" </p><p> </p><p>"Y-You're bleeding!" Shez shouted and tried wiping the blood away, though it only seemed to annoy Byleth since she tried pushing her away. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm okay." </p><p> </p><p>"No you're not!" Shez responded, grabbing her hand and trying to pull her along. If she hadn't been panicking, she likely would have noticed the nearby mercs watching the scene play out, a few chuckling at Shez’s franticness. As it stood, she was far more focused on the fact that Byleth kept bleeding and that she needed to fix this–Oh no, if Jeralt found out, he'd kick her out of the group for sure!</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully Shez was able to find the medic, who seemed a bit confused to see her dragging Byleth over. </p><p> </p><p>"P-Please stop the bleeding!"</p><p> </p><p>The healer sighed, her shoulders slumping. “Great, what did you two do this time?”</p><p> </p><p>"I-it was just an accident, no need to tell the captain!" Shez said, as Byleth finally pulled her hand free, seeming more annoyed at getting dragged around than the blood leaking down her face. Sighing again, the medic kneeled down, wiping away the blood to try and look at the wound. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, the good news is that it's not a bad cut, it just looks like it is because wounds above the eye bleed easily," the medic said, sitting Byleth down as she went to grab her supplies. </p><p> </p><p>“B-But it’s a lot of blood! And head injuries are bad, right?!”</p><p> </p><p>“I just said they bleed a lot. And sure, they can be, but this is just a cut,” she explained. The healer brushed Byleth’s hair back and dabbed at the wound with a cloth. Despite everything, Byleth didn’t even make a noise of discomfort at the sensation, instead just watching as the medic worked. “I don’t even need to use a vulnerary for something this small, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mh–B-But–”</p><p> </p><p>“I said it’s fine. I swear, you’re worse than Jeralt…”</p><p> </p><p>Shez blinked. “I am? Wait, what’s so bad about the captain?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not too much these days, aside from his drinking habits and his stubborn tendencies that make my work harder. I’ve heard some stories about just how protective he can be of this little weirdo though.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey!” The healer paused and glanced at Shez, who was glaring at her. “Don’t call Byleth a weirdo! She’s my destined rival!”</p><p> </p><p>“...Sure, kid.” She looked back to Byleth and gave her a pat on the head. “The ‘weirdo’ comment was meant to be affectionate. You’re easily the least annoying patient I have to deal with, if just because you actually stay quiet during exams.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Byleth replied, as monotone as ever. Shez was mollified, but only barely, as she still frowned at the healer to show her displeasure.</p><p> </p><p>The medic made an amused noise, before placing a small bandage across Byleth’s cut. “Keep this on for the day. There might be a little scar, but nothing that won’t fade in time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? She’s okay?” Shez asked, pressing closer than the medic would’ve preferred in her attempt to check on her rival.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s fine. What did you two do to get her hurt anyway? More sword fighting?”</p><p> </p><p>In an instant, Shez went from checking on Byleth with some obvious concern to ducking her head and fidgeting with her hands. “Uh…um…an icicle hit her, it wasn’t my fault.”</p><p> </p><p>“An icicle, huh? At this time of year? In this part of Fodlan? In the middle of our camp?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm. Well that is concerning. You two should show me where the icicles are growing so we can clear them off. We don’t want anyone else to get accidentally hit, do we?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Byleth agreed, before she hopped down from the stool and walked out of the tent, apparently intent on leading the way, much to Shez’s immediate alarm.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah! B-Byleth! Don’t–U-Um, w-wait up!”</p><p> </p><p>The healer smiled faintly as she watched the new girl scurry after Byleth. She didn’t particularly like kids, but seeing Jeralt’s near-silent daughter hanging around with a kid her age…well, it made her seem less creepy, at least.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, Miss Healer Lady!” Then Shez popped her head back into the tent again.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it, kid? Do you want me to actually see these icicles of yours?”</p><p> </p><p>“No! I mean…they’re kind of not real…a-anyway, thank you for your help! A-And please don’t tell Captain Jeralt!”</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t.” She didn’t need to. Half the camp was bound to tell him the instant he got back.</p><p> </p><p>Shez smiled brightly at her response though, so the healer decided not to mention that part. “Thank you! And, um…what’s your name?”</p><p> </p><p>“Gertrude.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay! Thank you Miss Gertrude!” </p><p> </p><p>Gertrude the healer watched Shez scamper off again, probably to keep Byleth from showing off whatever mishap she caused. She had a feeling she’d see the two of them in her tent sooner rather than later. Hopefully later, if just because she didn’t particularly like seeing injured children, but she wasn’t going to get her hopes up.</p><hr /><p>Somehow, Shez didn’t consider the fact that Byleth’s new bandage was really obvious. Obvious to the point that Jeralt immediately noticed and asked about it while the two of them were busy sorting some of the equipment.</p><p> </p><p>“An icicle hit me,” Byleth explained, and Shez felt a weird mix of relief and guilt when she heard the other girl lie for her.</p><p> </p><p>“An icicle, huh? I did notice one of the practice dummies seemed frostier than usual,” Jeralt noted, and Shez felt the guilty part start to grow.</p><p> </p><p>"An icicle hit it too." </p><p> </p><p>"Is that so?" </p><p> </p><p>"U-Uh, Captain Jeralt, sir," Shez spoke up, tentatively raising her hand as she prepared to admit her guilt. "I-It was my fault, I…wanted to show off my magic, but I wasn't able to control it." </p><p> </p><p>“Ahhh, now that makes more sense,” Jeralt said, nodding his head, “You cast a spell without a tome?”</p><p> </p><p>"A-ah, yes, my mom told me it wasn't safe, but I wanted to show off…" Jeralt was only able to let out a sigh before Shez spoke up again. "P-please don't kick me out of the group. I swear I won't do it again!" </p><p> </p><p>That gave him some pause. He didn’t think Shez would be that attached to his group, but…as he thought about it, it did make some sense. A girl who lost her mother, was basically thrown out of her village, and joined three different mercenary bands would probably have attachment issues.</p><p> </p><p>Crap, he definitely couldn’t leave her at the next village if that was the case. There was no way she would take it well. </p><p> </p><p>He sighed. “I’m not going to kick you out, Shez.”</p><p> </p><p>She immediately lit up. “You mean it?!” </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, but you better not practice magic again without a tome. Or someone to show you how to cast properly," Jeralt said, before muttering something about finding a mage to do so. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you sir!" Shez couldn't believe her luck at being able to stick around. Out of all the groups she's worked with before, this one was by far the easiest and best gig! Heck, she might just be a chore girl again, but she got plenty of good meals! </p><p> </p><p>"Just make sure to finish sorting the equipment, okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"Sir, yes, sir! Oh, uh, captain, I did want to ask you something. You wouldn't happen to have any books that have a hero and a rival, do you?" </p><p> </p><p>"I can check, why do you ask?" </p><p> </p><p>"Because, Byleth is my destined rival and she doesn't know what that means, so I have to show her!" Blinking, Jeralt turned to look at Byleth, who met his gaze. </p><p> </p><p>"She's going to teach me." </p><p> </p><p>…Jeralt wasn't sure, but had the two of them become friends? </p><p> </p><p>"I'll see what I can find." It was always hard to tell, but for a second, Jeralt saw a glimmer of what could’ve been happiness in his daughter’s eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, maybe keeping Shez around was a good idea. </p><p> </p>

  <span>Shez let out a yelp as her wrist was smacked with a training sword, making her drop her own wooden blade, before Byleth placed her sword against her throat. Shez couldn't help but take a step back as her rival's eyes bore into her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alright, that's enough training," Jeralt said, getting both of the girls' attention. Byleth moved back the instant she registered his words, leaving Shez to relax without the wooden blade at her neck. "Good job Shez. You've been improving, but you still have to be careful about overextending yourself." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite the slight praise, Shez couldn't help but pout a bit as she rubbed her wrist. Sure, it was only training, so it wasn't a big deal, but she still felt annoyed at losing. Especially since her rival didn't even seem pleased about winning! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Captain, it's time to meet the client," a mercenary said as he walked up, getting Jeralt’s attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's that time already? Alright you two, make sure to put your gear away, and stick by the camp ‘til I get back, okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, sir!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay, papa." Taking off their helmets, the two young girls made their way towards the storage tent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know, you could at least act happy that you won,” Shez muttered as they entered the tent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...?" Tilting her head slightly, Byleth stared at Shez. "But I am happy?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You sure don't act like you are." She gave Byleth a curious look. “In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile? Huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth didn’t seem to have a response to that. She just set her helmet down in its place and began unbuckling the training armor she wore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm…hey, By.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She paused and looked over at Shez. “By?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s your name. Well, part of it. It’s a shortened version, it makes it easier to say, but that’s not important! I have a very serious question,” Shez stated. She pressed her hands together in a way she’d seen some adults do when they were thinking. Or praying? One or the other. “Do you know what emotions are?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Somehow, Byleth’s usual flat look looked even flatter. “...I’m not stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t say you are!” Shez frowned, then shook off her annoyance– “Hey! Don’t leave!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth turned around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, so you know what emotions are, that’s good! That makes my new plans even easier!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth turned–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez grabbed Byleth’s arm to keep her from leaving. “No! Listen! I’m going to help you express yourself!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Let go of my arm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not until you agree to my lesson plan!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Papa says I’m allowed to hit people if they grab me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez frowned, but let go of Byleth’s arm. “Okay, fine, but first, I want to see you smile! Prove to me that you can do it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t want to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why not? It’s really easy.” Shez smiled wide, showing her teeth in a bright grin. “See? Now you do it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth showed her teeth. It couldn’t reasonably be called a smile by any metric, but to call it a grimace would ascribe emotion that just wasn’t there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez tilted her head. “Huh. Okay, maybe not like that…try it again with your lips closed!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” The second attempt was worse. Byleth clearly had enough of an idea of what a smile looked like, but her ability to actually make her lips curl upwards properly into one was so completely lacking even Shez felt faintly unnerved.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh…okay, that was better, you actually had kind of a smile there.” Luckily, Shez wasn’t the type to let discomfort get to her. “But you need to sort of…move your eyes? And not stretch your lips that far. It kinda looked like someone cut your cheeks when you did that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” She stopped “smiling”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But we can work on it! Actually, hm…do you know how to make any other expressions? What does it look like when you get mad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Huh, okay…what about when you’re sad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For the first time in her life, Byleth felt like sighing.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Jeralt felt like sighing. His more annoying clients were usually nobles, but there was something about a village headman with an inflated ego that just felt uniquely irritating. At least the job wouldn’t be too difficult. Clearing a band of bandits could vary in difficulty, but from all indications, this gang was a small one. Not too much trouble.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At least he could let the girls stay in town while he was out handling things. It always felt better when he didn’t have to worry about Byleth…Hm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Speaking of Byleth, he could hear someone in his tent again. It was noisier these days since Shez joined up, especially since she decided Byleth was her “rival”, and that was definitely her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–made a bunch of these, so you have to look at them!” That was a weird sentence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t completely sure why, but he moved carefully and slowly opened the tent flap, enough to peek inside instead of just announcing his presence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth and Shez were sitting on his daughter’s cot, and Shez was showing his daughter…papers?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“See, this one’s a happy face. See how the eyes are curled like this? And the smile’s–Wait, I need to explain this like a teacher…See how the lips are curled like this? That’s a smile!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know what a smile is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but it’s part of the explanation!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…What in the world were they doing?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, just remember, this is a happy face!” Shez insisted as she waved the paper in her hand near his daughter’s face. She set it down and picked up another paper, and Jeralt felt an eyebrow raise when he saw the blue frowning face on it. “And this is a sad face! See how it’s drooping? The eyes are curled differently, and the lips are frowning, not smiling!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And there’s usually tears and snot when someone’s crying, so it’s gross. I think the lips are kind of pouty too? But pouting’s different from frowning! You jut out your lip when you’re pouting or puff up your face, stuff like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you draw that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…didn’t think I needed to…um, that’s for next time! For the advanced class!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt started to get an idea of what was going on here, and he wasn’t sure if he should be annoyed at Shez for trying to push Byleth to emote…or glad she cared enough about his kid to try “helping”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Anyway! This next one’s a mad face! It’s for when you’re angry! See how the eyes are glaring and the mouth is frowning? It’s a different frown from a sad frown though. It’s a…snarl, I think. Or maybe a scowl? It’s very ‘grrrrr’. Try making that noise! It’ll help!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Grrrrr,” Byleth growled in complete monotone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, maybe not like that…It’s okay, we’ll work on it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Hi papa.” Ah, guess he was noticed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth looked over at him and Shez followed her gaze a second later. The purple-haired girl squeaked, and Jeralt felt like he shouldn’t be amused by her obvious surprise. He was, of course, but still. “C-Captain Jeralt, sir!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She tried to salute and smacked herself in the face with the paper. Since she couldn’t see it, he let himself smile for a brief second before putting his stern face back on. “Shez, what are you doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-Ah, um…I was trying to teach Byleth about emotions?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She wants me to smile better so she knows when I’m happy,” Byleth explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that! Exactly! Wow, you’re a good student.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt knew his daughter wasn’t the emotive type. It gave him no end of concern in her early years, but he got used to it, and he knew that while she didn’t show much emotion, she wasn’t completely emotionless. So he felt some amusement at seeing a flicker of annoyance cross Byleth’s face, followed by actual surprise when Shez gave her a pat on the head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What are you doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, this is what my mom did when I did well in her lessons. It feels nice, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah. Papa does that too sometimes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh hey, that’s–” Shez seemed to remember Jeralt was still there and dropped her hand from Byleth’s head with a sheepish smile. And, while it went quick, for a moment, Jeralt thought he saw his daughter pout.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Relax, I’m not mad,” Jeralt said. He was having a hard time keeping himself from smiling. “I don’t mind if you two do stuff like this. It’s better than any unsupervised magic or sparring.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez ducked her head, embarrassed, and he took a moment to glance at the papers at her side. Which…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How much paper did you use?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Uh…” Shez glanced at the small pile. “...um…well, um, I tried making one for every emotion I could think of, so…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know that stuff costs money, right?” Maybe he was having too much fun messing with the new kid, but the stricken look on her face was priceless. “Well, whatever. I’ll just take the cost out of your pay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, I’m getting paid?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re part of the group, so yeah, you’re getting paid. Ask me later and I’ll hand over what you’ve already racked up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should get paid too,” Byleth piped up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You already get an allowance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. I should get more. I work here too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, but you’re also my kid, which makes it an allowance instead of pay. And you’re too young to ask me for a raise, so don’t bother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry By, I’m sure when you’re a full blown mercenary like me, you’ll get a bigger allowance!” Shez reassured. Then she smiled brightly. “Ah, see! That’s an angry face! Good job!”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"You're pouting." Byleth said as she stared at Shez. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course I am!" Shez responded while she continued sulking, "It's not fair the captain is making us wait here while they go on a mission."  </p><p> </p><p>“We have a mission.”</p><p> </p><p>“Buying supplies isn’t a mission! It’s a chore!”</p><p> </p><p>“Papa said it’s an assignment,” Byleth contradicted, “He also said you need to buy more paper to replace the ones you used.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez huffed in annoyance, before looking at the list Captain Jeralt gave her. The list written on paper, she might add, so it wasn’t just her wasting it! Not that the stuff she made was a waste! “Okay, the list says we need paper and ink, which some merchants should maybe have. Also smoked or salted meat from the butchery, leather if there’s a tanner, some extra bandages and vulneraries…eesh, there’s a lot here…How are we gonna carry all of this?”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re not. Papa wants us to order the things on the list. We tell the seller we need it and then someone from the camp gets it later.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ohhh, that makes so much more sense. Do you do this a lot?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged. “Not a lot. I usually go with papa.”</p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, well in that case, I'll be taking charge!" </p><p> </p><p>"But I'm older." </p><p> </p><p>"And which one of us is the actual paid mercenary? Ah, hey you're getting good at the angry face!" Grinning, Shez grabbed her hand. "Besides, do you want to be the one talking to the villagers?" </p><p> </p><p>At the lack of response, Shez smiled again, before pulling Byleth along. </p><p> </p><p>"So, you thinking of buying anything else?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hm…bread sounds nice." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, yeah, but anything else besides food?" </p><p> </p><p>"...?" Byleth tilted her head in faint confusion. </p><p> </p><p>"You know, like a book, or something else? Actually, do you have any hobbies?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Fishing is nice." </p><p> </p><p>"...I'm really starting to feel like I'm the older one." </p><p> </p><p>“You’re not.”</p><p> </p><p>“I could be! When were you born?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth tilted her head in thought. “...Not sure. Papa says I was born in Horsebow though.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay! So that’s the…one, two, three–Sixth month! I think…Were you born in Fall?”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess. When were you born?”</p><p> </p><p>“I…” Shez paused. “...uh…I don’t know. Mom and I didn't really celebrate birthdays, and I don't remember anything from before she took me in." </p><p> </p><p>“Oh. When did she take you in?”</p><p> </p><p>“No idea!” Shez confidently proclaimed, “So I’m probably older than you.”</p><p> </p><p>“...How does that make sense?”</p><p> </p><p>“It just does. Now come on!”</p><p> </p><p>Forced to concede to Shez’s unassailable logic, or just not really interested in continuing this conversation, Byleth resigned herself to being pulled along by the definitely not older girl.</p><p> </p><p>And so, while Shez and Byleth went around purchasing supplies, Byleth did her best to remember just how old she was. She remembered her papa saying Shez was maybe twelve and Byleth was sure she was older than that…maybe. She got her dagger as a present to celebrate her…tenth year? How many years ago was that… </p><p> </p><p>"Alrighty, that should be everything, and hey, we got some spare gold if we wanna get something for ourselves!" Shez announced, snapping Byleth out of her thoughts. </p><p> </p><p>"Use your own money." </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, come on, it's not like he's gonna know." </p><p> </p><p>"I thought you were a 'paid mercenary’." That definitely got Shez to shut her mouth, before she huffed. </p><p> </p><p>"Fine fine, I'll use my own money," Shez muttered as she looked around to see what exactly the village was selling. It wasn't exactly a sprawling place, so they didn't have much when it came to commodities. Even so, the merchant selling vulneraries also had a few odds and ends, so there was something at least. "Oh hey, By, look!" </p><p> </p><p>Grabbing a book titled 'Of Knights and Mages', Shez showed it off to Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"This is a story my mom read to me before, it has the destined rivals!" Grinning, she handed it to Byleth. "Here, a present from me!" </p><p> </p><p>"...Really?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course!" Handing over some gold for the book, Shez continued smiling. "It might be a few months late, but as the older one it's only right I get you a present." </p><p> </p><p>"...Hm." Glancing over at the wares, Byleth paused for a moment, before grabbing a hair clip and putting it on Shez, moving her hair out of her eye in the process. "Here." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh?" </p><p> </p><p>"Present for you, we can make today your birthday." For a brief moment, Shez could have sworn Byleth seemed smug. "And since it's after my birthday that means you're younger than me.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hey, wait, that’s cheating!”</p><p> </p><p>“No it’s not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it is–H-Hey, don’t walk away!” Shez demanded. She felt her face redden, especially when she heard the merchant snicker from behind her, before she huffed and followed after Byleth. She quickly caught up to the shorter girl and bumped her shoulder against hers. “You’re lucky it’s my birthday so I’m feeling generous.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth didn’t dignify that with a response, leading Shez to pout again.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph…so, hey, do you know how to read? I just realized it would be a bad idea to get you a book if you can’t read it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can read. Papa taught me how.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ohh, that makes sense. Captain Jeralt seems smart…hm. Hey, tell me more about yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because I don’t know a lot about you and I should if you’re gonna be my destined rival! Here, I’ll go first. My name is Shez–”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that part.”</p><p> </p><p>“–I was born in…um, not sure, but I’m from…uh, wait, what was the village called…?”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t know a lot about yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! I know…important stuff! What about you? Where were you born?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez blinked. “Wait, you too? Wow, that’s funny. And more proof that we’re destined to be rivals!”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth’s lips twitched for a moment. That hadn’t happened before, so she was a little surprised by her own reaction. It didn’t feel like too big of a deal though, so she kept leading the way towards the camp.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm…Well, I don’t really know much about my birth parents. Mom didn’t know much about them either, she said she found me when I was abandoned, but I think they’re probably dead. Maybe from war or something?” Shez shrugged. “Hmm…oh, my mom’s name was Periander! That’s important, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess. My papa’s name is Jeralt.”</p><p> </p><p>“I knew that part already! Hm…do you know your mom’s name?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused. She didn’t. “I don’t. I never met her.”</p><p> </p><p>“She probably died then,” Shez noted. She nodded to herself, confident in her guess, then noticed Byleth had stopped walking. “...Oh. Oh, um, sorry! I didn’t–”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay. I didn’t really think about it before.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hey, come on.” Shez took Byleth’s hand and pulled her along, leading her over to one of the trees in between the edge of town and the edge of where their camp was set up. She sat down under it, and patted the ground beside herself. “Sit!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth sat.</p><p> </p><p>Shez smiled, then scooted closer to Byleth and pulled her new book open to the first page. “Here, let’s read together! You can learn about destined rivals!”</p><p> </p><p>“...Okay.” Byleth settled in, letting her back rest against the trunk of the tree, and began to read.</p><hr /><p>“Ugh, do we really have to bring back the leader’s head? Can’t we just go with an ear? That’s so much easier to carry,” complained one of Jeralt’s mercenaries on the way back to camp. He was one of the longer lasting ones, though Jeralt wasn’t totally sure which one he was. Either Victor or Hector, something like that…or Harold? Or…No, it was probably Victor.</p><p> </p><p>“The headman made his terms clear,” Jeralt said, glancing back at his complaining subordinate, “Besides, you’re the one who decided to bet on who had to carry it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but I didn’t think I’d lose.”</p><p> </p><p>He tried not to sigh as he trudged back with the rest of his band, leading Argo by his reins for the moment. The woods had been too dense to really go in as proper cavalry so what would’ve been an easy rout turned into a bloody fight. Not on his side, at least. The blood currently dripping off his troops wasn't their own, though cleaning everything off was going to be a pain.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw! Captain, look at that!”</p><p> </p><p>He paused in his thoughts and glanced over to where another of his mercs was pointing. </p><p> </p><p>Sitting underneath a tree was Byleth and Shez, a book in both their laps as the two kids leaned on each other, obviously asleep.</p><p> </p><p>“D’aw, that’s sweet,” Victor said, before casually hoisting the sack holding the bandit boss’s head over his shoulder, “Right, guess that means I’ll be handing this over. You see to your kids, captain, I’ll see if I can bring the money back.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Yeah, alright, go for it,” he agreed, waving his troops off. He looked over at his daughter again. She looked…relaxed. Just completely at peace.</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, there’s no way she’s going to let Shez go,” he muttered under his breath, before heading over to the two. If Byleth was a few years younger, he might’ve picked her up and taken her to her bed, but even if age wasn’t about to catch up to him any time soon, she was definitely getting too heavy for that. That, and he wasn’t sure what to do with Shez in that situation, so he lightly shook his daughter’s shoulder. “Hey kid, wake up.”</p><p> </p><p>With a slight fluttering of her eyes, Byleth woke up to stare up at her dad. </p><p> </p><p>"Papa?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hey there, sorry for waking you up, but you two should really sleep in a tent instead of under a tree," Jeralt said, speaking softly. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…okay." Closing the book, Byleth held it close. "...Papa, what was mom's name?" </p><p> </p><p>“...” Jeralt needed a second. No, what he needed was to be deep in his cups so this question wouldn’t feel like a sucker punch straight to his gut. But he didn’t have that. What he had was a daughter asking about her mother for the first time. And he had no idea how to begin that conversation. So he just…answered her. “Sitri. Her name was Sitri.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm.” She looked up at him, her blue eyes completely unlike his own. He could so clearly see her mother in her that it hurt, like an old wound reopened. “...”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth moved up and leaned her head against his chest, like she used to when she was little and tired. “...She died.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, kid. She did.”</p><p> </p><p>No more questions came after that. Byleth just stayed close, and before long, his daughter was asleep again. </p><p> </p><p>Jeralt let out a slow, soft sigh, and picked her up. It was easier than he expected.</p><p> </p><p>He glanced down at Shez, sighed, and lightly shook her awake too.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m up!” she snapped awake, blinking rapidly, then seemed to recognize his presence. “O-Oh, uh, hey captain! Um…oh! Mission accomplished! We put in orders and–”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need a full report. Come on, if you two are this tired, you should get to bed.”</p><p> </p><p>“I-I’m not tired–” Her immediate yawn proved she was lying, and Jeralt couldn’t help his slight grin at her embarrassed look. </p><p> </p><p>“Want me to carry you too?”</p><p> </p><p>“N-No! I can walk!” she insisted, and did a good job of getting up too. Still, he kept an eye on her as they headed back to the tent. </p><p> </p><p>And while Jeralt would never admit it, at least while he was sober, he found it nice that she was there. His daughter needed a friend, and he was glad she found one.</p>

  <p>
  <span>"Shez's birthday was yesterday," Byleth told her dad when he awoke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh?” Jeralt took a moment, blinking awake, then gave his daughter a confused look. “Since when did you know when her birthday is?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Since last year," Byleth explained, before a slight pout appeared on her face. "I wanted to tell you, but you returned late on your mission." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…yeah, sorry about that." It probably wasn't a fair excuse, but after the job of clearing out those giant wolves went on much longer than expected, he couldn't help getting maybe a bit too excited for the feast he was offered. Especially with the high quality booze they had. Turns out nobles were sometimes good for something… "Did you two have fun yesterday?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, the bakery had some nice bread rolls." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's good," Jeralt said, feeling relieved that the town he left them in was nice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez also wants to show you something," Byleth said, gesturing for him to follow her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh?" A bit confused, Jeralt felt her grab his hand and do her best to pull him out of the bed he was using. Which, well, Jeralt was curious to see what was going on, so he followed along. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there, Captain, Sir! I hope you're ready to be blown away!" Shez greeted as she stood in the training field, her hands on a pair of training swords.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Alright, what am I looking at?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My new style!” she declared, before turning towards a training dummy and showing off some type of two sword style she developed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t that bad, he had to admit as he watched how easily she swung each sword, delivering quick blow after blow to the dummy. It wasn’t his type of thing at all, admittedly, but he’d always been built for heavy hits instead of this quick and light stuff.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He did let out an impressed whistle when Shez took off the dummy’s head with her off hand. “Not bad. Not bad at all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, wow, I didn’t–O-Oh, thanks sir!” She smiled brightly, before turning and leveling her sword at his daughter. “Now, my fated rival, we shall–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to have to fix the Headless Dummy later though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It shouldn’t be so funny to take the wind out of the kid’s sails, but it, well, it was. “Nh…o-okay, but later! For now, Byleth–Wait, where’s Byleth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Over here,” Byleth called out from the armory tent, where she’d just gotten a training sword and helmet for herself. “I’m ready.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You could at least let me finish issuing the challenge.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stared. “Are we going to fight now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! We are! And I’m going to win this time!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you say so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Surprisingly enough, Shez actually put her coin where her mouth was for once. Jeralt kept a close eye on things the whole time, because training gear or not, he didn’t want the kids hurting each other, and he had to admit, Shez had definitely figured out something suitable for herself. Her fast movements were something Byleth had seen before, but adding the second sword into the mix threw her off enough that Jeralt already made a mental note to change up his daughter’s training.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was fourteen already, so maybe he should see if the other mercs would be willing to spar? Either way, he clapped his hands together the instant he saw Shez catch Byleth’s sword and get a solid strike in across the head. He tried not to react too badly as he saw his daughter hit the dirt, instead offering Shez a smile. “Good work there, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...huh? Wait, I did it? I did it! Byleth! I did it!” Shez practically squealed, her eyes bright and happy as she smiled down at her friend…before she frowned and nudged Byleth with her foot. “By? Are you okay? Hey, By!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt, having seen his daughter give Shez an annoyed look and then deliberately close her eyes, sighed in some exasperation. “Byleth, don’t play dead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...mh. She would have believed me,” Byleth complained as she sat up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez huffed, elation turning to frustration as she tapped Byleth on the head with her sword. “Don’t do that! You made me worried!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry.” Byleth pushed herself up, then reached up and patted Shez on her helmet. “Good job.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm, no, it doesn’t work as well. You’re shorter than me so it feels weird when you do it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” She poked Shez’s nose instead, making her squawk indignantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey! Is that any way to treat someone older than you, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your birthday was yesterday.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The birthday you decided on! I won the privilege of being older by beating you! That was the agreement!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt raised an eyebrow. He wasn’t sure what was going on, but he was also pretty sure, despite being taller than Byleth already and looking like she’d get even bigger as she grew into a lanky teen, Shez was probably a year younger than his daughter. Granted, he did guess that she was ten when he first met her, so his view might be skewed…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want a rematch.” And there was some unexpected stubbornness from Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…no.” And Shez completely refused, dropping her swords in favor of sprinting in the opposite direction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt couldn’t help it. He laughed outright, especially when he saw the look of genuine offense on Byleth’s face before she chased after her friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hahahahaha! Ahh…hm…I guess I should do something for the kid’s birthday…the other kid.” Jeralt frowned at himself. “I should also come up with something to call Shez other than kid if I’m going to keep using that nickname for Byleth…”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"So captain, when are you letting us on a mission with you?" Shez asked while she repaired the headless dummy. Byleth had finally caught her and dragged her back to fix it up, so Jeralt was supervising.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"This again? How many times are you going to keep asking?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Until you let us join! Come on, By and I are tough, so you're just wasting us by keeping us on the side!" Jeralt couldn't help but sigh at her response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even if I did take you two along, it wouldn't be on our next mission. I may not like nobles but I have to at least keep up appearances in front of a major noble." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw! But that’s more reason we should go! Byleth needs to know how to talk to nobles if she’s going to take jobs, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not retiring anytime soon, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but…eventually! You’re old, right? So you gotta prepare!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m old, but I’m not gray. Besides, even if I was quitting, which I’m not, I wouldn’t take Byleth to meet a Count for her first noble negotiation. Nobles are prickly at the best of times, and the job we’re taking is coming from one of the Alliance’s leaders.” He frowned in thought. “At least I think he is. I’m not completely sure how that round table thing works.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s more reason why we should go then! Meeting a big noble is going to be great for our reputations!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, no. I understand you want to go, but it’s just a bad idea right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez grumbled under her breath and stepped away from the slightly more stable dummy with its head belted back on. They’d probably need a better fix if they actually wanted to keep its head on, but it would work for now. “Well…what about the mission, huh? We could come along for that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Goddess save him from stubborn children… “I’ll have to see what it is first.” He held up a hand to keep her from getting too excited. “I’m not saying yes. I’m just saying if it turns out to be something easy, I might let you two watch. From a distance. With someone keeping an eye on you so you don’t charge into the fray.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t do that!” At his flat look, she relented, scuffing her boot in the dirt. “...I’ll be good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright. Now, let’s see if we have anything that will keep this poor guy’s head on…we should still have some nails around here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay." Shez said, still pouting. Though that stopped as Jeralt gave her a pat on the head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on now, you're a good kid, I just want to make sure you and Byleth are fully prepared before you join the battlefield." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I know, but you don't have to worry so much dad." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's not going to-...what did you say?" And it seemed Shez realized just what exactly she said since she suddenly stiffened. "Shez, did you-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt raised his hand to catch the disembodied training dummy head that was thrown at him, taking a moment to stare at it, before he looked back up to see Shez running away from the training grounds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'm not drunk enough for this." Jeralt said, before unceremoniously dropping the head on the ground. </span>

  <span>“How do you think it’s going?” Shez asked, glancing up at Byleth. The other girl was standing beside her, her hand on a short spear as she looked out into the distance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably good. Papa is good at his job.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s true, he is.” Shez shifted in place and squinted, trying to see if there were any poachers out on the fields or in the woods. “…Being a lookout is really boring.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! It definitely is! We’re just waiting until we see something!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess. You’re supposed to blow a whistle if we see something. That sounds interesting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But that's only if we see something, and like you said, with how good the captain is at his job, we probably won't see anything!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…is everything okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aside from how bored I am?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did something happen with you and papa?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Huh? What do you mean?" Shez asked, making it obvious something was wrong. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You were being quiet back at the camp, even when Papa gave us the whistle and told us where to go." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-Well, th-that's just cause I ate something weird earlier!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…Did you eat a bug?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...why is that your first thought?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve eaten bugs before,” Byleth explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Were they any good?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not really. Did you know ants are spicy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They are?? That’s so weird–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“EEEEYAAAAAH!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both girls paused, then looked at each other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Was that a scream?” “That wasn’t you.” they said in unison, before Shez frowned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would that be me–Wait! That was a scream! From the village!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it sounds like it. I didn’t notice any–Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez was already halfway down the hill in a full sprint, heading for the village as quickly as she could! The mission was to protect the villagers, so she was going to do exactly that! “Byleth, you handle the signal thing! I’ll save everybody!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth barely heard what her friend said. Running away from someone didn’t make it easy for them to hear what you’re saying, funny enough. And even if she did properly hear what Shez said, the purple-haired girl forgot one important fact: She was the one with the whistle.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Sauin Village was a fairly peaceful place most days. As a village of hunters, trappers, and traders, it wasn’t unusual for the smell of blood to linger in places with how much freshly caught game tended to be brought through the area. That didn’t mean things were violent though; catching food and trading furs were natural parts of life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A grown man holding a sword to the throat of a young girl most definitely was not the natural state of affairs around there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“BACK OFF! STAY BACK ALL OF YOU OR THE BRAT BREATHES THROUGH A NEW HOLE IN HER NECK!” threatened the poacher, his eyes wide and desperate as he backed up closer and closer to the village’s stables.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“L-Let go of me–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“SHUT IT, BRAT!” the poacher screeched, “YOU’RE LUCKY I DON’T CUT YOU OPEN RIGHT HERE AS VENGEANCE FOR MY COMRADES!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let her go!” shouted one of the nearby villagers. A few had gathered at the commotion, though no one was willing to risk getting too close to the wild-eyed thug. “Leonie didn’t do anything to you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“THIS LITTLE SHIT THREATENED ME!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She had a stick–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I DON’T CARE!” He moved the sword from the young girl’s neck and leveled it at the closest villager. “NOW BACK OFF AND LET US GET SOME STEEDS OR I’LL CUT HER BLOODY NOSE OFF–GYAH!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Whatever other threats he was going to make were cut off in a sharp scream as Shez rammed her hunting knife into the skinny man’s side. His vest was barely padded and she could feel the blade sink in as she shoved him to the ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The orange-haired girl fell away from the poacher, her eyes wide in shock and confusion as Shez pushed herself up, a bright grin on her face. “Don’t worry! I’ve got this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-Woah…woah, how did you do that!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Speed, strength, and plenty of training–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“FHAAAH, GODDESS, FUCK!” screamed the poacher, clutching at the knife in his side, “YOU LITTLE SHIT! YOU STABBED ME! AH, GODDESS, I’M DYING!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eesh, he’s really loud,” Shez complained, before shaking it off, “Well, anyways, hi there! I’m Shez, of Jeralt’s Mercenaries, and I–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, wait!” Leonie interrupted, remembering something very important, “There were two of–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Some instinct prompted Shez to move, tackling Leonie out of the way just in time as an axe crashed down into the ground where she’d been sitting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Damn it, Lloyd, you were supposed to keep them distracted,” growled the larger, bulkier, greasy-haired poacher, scowling over at his thinner, balding comrade as he ripped the axe out of the dirt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Screw you Vincent! I have a knife in my guts!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s a really big guy,” Shez muttered under her breath. She glanced back at the orange-haired girl and gave her a light push. “Come on, get moving!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-Wait! What about you!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, I know exactly what I’m doing!” Shez lied. Leonie didn’t know that though, so she just nodded with some visible hesitation and concern, before running over to the villagers currently hanging back, none willing to get close to the axe-wielding brute.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, did the logical thing for herself to do in this situation and drew the sword at her hip. Jeralt had given her a few lessons on handling live steel over the months, so she knew what she was doing. Well, she knew what she was doing in handling a sword. Facing off against a man twice her size…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Vincent seemed to notice her hesitation from the scoff he let out. “You’re joking. A pipsqueak like you thinks she can take me? You might’ve gotten my bud with that cheap shot, but you’re not getting one on me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need a cheap shot to take down someone like you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He barked a laugh. “You’ve got a spine, kid! It’s almost a shame I gotta tear it out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No it’s not!” Lloyd shouted, “Just kill her already!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite his demands, Shez moved first, lunging for the big man with some quick stabs at his chest that he blocked with the blade of his axe. She dodged back as he swung in retaliation and tried to maneuver around him, using her smaller size and quicker speed to find a gap in his defense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he backhanded her and she remembered she shouldn’t keep her eyes on just his weapon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His fist crashed into the side of her head with the force of a boulder, sending her down before his hand went around her throat and he slammed her up against the wall of the stable, driving the air from her lungs in a wheezing choke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Too bad, brat,” he taunted as she struggled, kicking at his chest and pulling at his thick fingers, “A few more years, and you might’ve been trouble. You won’t have to worry about that now though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His grip tightened and she wheezed again, trying to breathe under the crushing force squeezing down on her neck. Black spots were starting to fill her vision and she could feel her heart beating faster and faster, even as her struggles were starting to slow. She couldn’t die here, not like this, but it was getting so hard to keep going–No! No, she refused to think like that, there had to be a way out, there had to be something–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A strange feeling came over her for a moment, a weird feeling of strength and motion, like something inside her was trying to get out–Then she felt the grip around her neck loosen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez dropped to the ground, coughing and gasping as her lungs ached for air, then the headless body of Vincent the poacher collapsed to the ground a second later and Shez saw Byleth’s face in front of her own as the blue-haired girl looked her over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s bruising. I have a vulnerary, it’ll help. Can you drink it now?” Byleth asked. Her eyes were completely on Shez, checking what damages her friend had suffered, but Shez was more focused on the sword in Byleth’s grip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She dimly recognized it as the sword the other poacher, Lloyd, had been wielding, and there was blood dripping down the blade. Byleth had grabbed it and cleaved Vincent’s head off in one stroke. That was…wow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow…” Shez mumbled, before noticing Byleth’s frown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you concussed? How many fingers am I holding up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...By, that’s the hilt of a sword.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Incorrect, I had two fingers extended. We should get you checked out–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You little shits...if I’m going down, I’m taking you both with me!” the somehow still alive second poacher, Lloyd, snarled as he pushed himself to his feet and ripped the knife out of his side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He made it two paces before the logical thing happened. No, he didn’t die of blood loss, though he likely would have in a few more seconds; no, instead a thrown spear essentially obliterated his head as Jeralt arrived on the scene.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"C-Captain-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you two okay?" Jeralt asked, worry evident in his voice as he looked down at them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Y-Yes, sir." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I checked her, she's okay." At their responses, Jeralt nodded, seeming relieved before his features hardened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What do you think you're doing!? I told you to stay on lookout!" Jeralt shouted, making Shez stiffen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"S-Sorry, Sir-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't want to hear an apology, I want an explanation," Jeralt stated, staring down at the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...U-Uh, w-well, sir-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's my fault, I heard someone screaming in the town and rushed ahead." Byleth said, trying to take the blame for Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't lie, I know you're not the type to do that," Jeralt retorted, not believing her for a moment, "Look, we'll talk about this later. For now, both of you head back to camp, and I better see you two there when I head by later." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez cringed at the captain’s obvious anger and frustration, but didn’t resist as Byleth helped her to her feet. “...s-sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’d already moved away by that point, heading over to the poacher’s corpse to pull his lance free from the ruined skull, but Byleth gave her a pat on the back. “It will be okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mnh…are you sure? I’ve never seen him mad like that…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s fine. Papa just wants us to be safe.” Byleth gave Shez a slight smile. She still wasn’t that good at them, but the small smile was still reassuring. “Let’s go back to camp. We can get something to eat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez snorted, brushing at her eyes. “Is food the only thing you think about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think about lots of things. Food is important.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Including bugs?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Most food is important."</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Jeralt was a man who had lived far longer than most people would. He had been in countless battles and faced immeasurable challenges. Even so, when he was stressed, he had one response: find the nearest mug of ale. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And, despite the mess that had occurred, the villagers of Sauin were more than happy to offer him and his mercenaries a feast. The ale might not have been the best, but the villagers really knew their stuff when it came to food. Guess it must come with the territory of being a hunting village. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tearing into a chunk of boar meat, Jeralt savored the flavor, before washing it down with some ale. Truly, it was the simple rewards that made being a merc worth it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"C-Captain Jeralt!" Came a young voice, catching his attention. Glancing over, Jeralt saw a young girl, Leonie if he remembered correctly, standing behind him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you need something?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wanted to say, thank you for saving us!" Leonie said, before bowing to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was just doing my job,” Jeralt responded as he turned to face her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"S-Still, you're a hero! You haven't even been here for long and you took out the poachers no problem, and the way you threw that spear was super cool! You didn't even hesitate to save those two girls!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They wouldn't have needed saving if they actually listened to my orders,” Jeralt muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Th-They were just trying to save me! Well, Shez was anyway." Leonie muttered the last part. "S-Still, it was my fault for getting captured!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Not sure how you getting held hostage can be your fault." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I uh…might have tried to fend the poacher off when he arrived. I thought I could have been a hero like you." Leonie said, before trying to shake her unease and seem confident. "B-But I wanted to ask if you could make me your apprentice!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Jeralt really needed to drink more. Grabbing his mug, Jeralt downed what remained before he answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry kid, I'm not looking for an apprentice." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Th-Then what about those two girls? They don't look any older than me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They're not my apprentices, they're my kids." Jeralt responded, not really thinking about his response in his drunken state. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, Captain, Shez is actually your kid?" one of his mercs asked, butting in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Upon being asked that, Jeralt paused, and began to think about Shez. Sure she might have been more than a handful, but…he couldn't help but think of how fond he was of the brat. And while Byleth might have learned a few bad lessons from her, Shez had been a good influence overall… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, she's my kid,” he decided. It wasn’t like he needed anything official to adopt her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, dammit, I lost the bet!" the merc yelled, slamming his hands on the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What bet?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"C-Captain!" Leonie spoke up before Jeralt could get his answer. "Even if you aren't looking for an apprentice, are you sure I can't join your group? Anyone around here can tell you how good of a hunter I am!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt couldn't help but let out a sigh at her pleading eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Look, I'm not going to take you along." He raised a hand before she could speak. "But…we were hired to take care of the poachers, and it would look bad on me if I left without making sure they were completely dealt with. So I might stick around for a few days if you want to learn a few things." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Leonie immediately lit up, smiling bright and happy. “I won’t let you down, Captain!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt tried not to groan. Something about this felt way too familiar and he was far too sober to deal with it.</span>

  <p>
  <span>“Hello! My name is Leonie Pinelli, and I’m going to be Captain Jeralt’s new apprentice!” greeted the new girl on the training field, her bright and eager expression completely at odds with Jeralt’s visible hangover and exhaustion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I thought I said I wasn't looking for an apprentice," Jeralt said, rubbing his head as he tried to soothe his headache. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, right, sorry captain!" Leonie said, still sounding very eager as she stood before Shez and Byleth, both of whom seemed unsure of what was going on. Which, right, they still hadn't talked about what had happened at the village the day prior. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Papa, is everything okay?" Byleth asked, deciding to speak up as Shez shifted in place </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Everything is okay, Leonie is just going to be joining us for training while we're here," Jeralt said, before glancing at Shez. "We can talk about what happened after training." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now then, to start, Leonie, what weapons are you good with?" Jeralt asked, addressing the new girl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm really good with the bow, Captain! Ah, but I would love to learn how to use the spear!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so? In that case, I can certainly help teach you a thing or two. You kids mind helping her out with the training gear?" Jeralt asked his two kids. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a moment, Byleth nodded, walking over with Shez to help Leonie get set up. They weren’t planning to spar, at least not immediately, so some basic gloves and padding would be fine for protection.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So what’s it like fighting with Captain Jeralt?” Leonie asked, smiling brightly at Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We usually stay at the camp,” Byleth answered in her usual monotone, and Jeralt fought back a wince at how obviously Leonie frowned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Well, you have to do some interesting stuff around here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, we do. Here, you’ll want one of these ones, they’re shorter and easier to use.” Byleth handed Leonie one of the training spears, but the new girl’s frown didn’t disappear. In fact, she looked more annoyed at Byleth’s flat, matter-of-fact replies.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We mostly help out around,” Shez spoke up, some of her nerves fading as she talked, “It’s mostly chores, but every bit is important to keep the camp running!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, I can imagine!” And Leonie’s mood immediately turned right around. Jeralt knew Byleth wasn’t the best with new people, but since things turned out well with Shez…well, maybe he was just getting in his own head here.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, now that you’ve got your weapon, let’s work on your form,” he said, deciding to interrupt the socializing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes captain!” Leonie replied. She snapped to attention in an instant, so she had that going for her at least.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It had been a while since Jeralt worked with someone who didn’t have a foundation to work off of. Shez picked things up quickly, especially with the training she got in her previous merc bands, and he helped Byleth train from the moment she could hold a sword steady. And that wasn’t even mentioning the recruits he’d had to deal with back in the day…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Leonie clearly had some training, but it was a hunter, not a lancer. “You want the tip to stay up, pointed towards their face like this. That keeps your head protected and lets you move it easier. Right hand here, left hand down here, you guide with your right and push with your left. Keep your right foot forward, we’ll work on footwork once we get the armwork down. The butt should be by your hip, the tip at eye level. Like I said, aim for the face, not the neck, it’s easier to maneuver and no one wants to get stabbed in the face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He did still know what he was doing though. “Short thrust, you partially extend your arm but keep your elbow bent. Long thrust, you extend it all the way. Keep your footing firm. You don’t need to stay in place, but you do need to be steady. Low thrusts are an option, but remember, most people are going to armor their chest and you need to be prepared for how it feels to punch into that. The main point to lances is thrusting, you don’t want to swing it like it’s a blade for your first option, even if you're handling something like a halberd. If you get deflected, you can always bring it around for a slash, much easier than trying to thrust again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Leonie was taking to the lesson quickly enough. The girl might be green, but she was willing to learn and didn’t even complain when he made it clear he expected at least twenty reps against a dummy to make sure she had the basic thrust down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez and Byleth were hanging around nearby, and…right, he really should address things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kid–Byleth, keep an eye on Leonie. I need to talk to Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay." Nodding, Byleth took a position nearby to keep an eye on Leonie as Jeralt and Shez stepped away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you need something, Sir?" Shez asked, nervousness evident in her voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Clearing his throat, Jeralt tried his best not to speak too roughly. "Can you tell me why you rushed in yesterday?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"U-Uh, w-well, it's just…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not mad, I just want to hear why." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I didn't really think, I just heard someone screaming so I wanted to go help…and when I got there, I thought if I saved the day, it would prove to you that we don't need to be babied anymore," Shez explained, unable to look him in the eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And why didn't you use the whistle?" And that got Shez to stiffen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I, uh, kinda…told Byleth to use it, but I forgot I was the one who had it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Right." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"S-Sorry, Sir!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You don't need to apologize," Jeralt said, trying to think about the right thing to say, "I'm not trying to baby you, but when you're a mercenary a single mistake can lead to your death. Hell, if you hadn't been pushing for it so hard, I probably wouldn't have let you and Byleth join a mission for another two years." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"T-Two??" Shez asked incredulously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, two, likely three if this is how your first mission went." Jeralt probably shouldn't have been amused at Shez blanching. "But I just want to make sure you two are ready. I mean, you're both my kids." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...H-Huh?" Thankfully for Shez, the two of them got interrupted by Leonie letting out a yelp. Looking over, they saw the young hunter on the floor, having seemingly gotten knocked over by Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, who said you two could spar?" Jeralt asked, approaching the two to help Leonie up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She wanted to," Byleth answered, earning a glare from Leonie. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I did, and she cheated! She kicked my legs out from under me!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's cheating?" Shez asked from behind Jeralt. Sighing, Jeralt shook his head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Leonie, if there's one thing you learn from me, then it's this. There's no such thing as cheating when it comes to a fight. It's better to play dirty and win, then it is to play fair and lose." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She blinked. "Really?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, honor doesn't mean anything if you're dead. As far as we're concerned, a mercs honor is whether they can complete a job or not. Course, you still have to look out for yourself, if a noble is treating you poorly there's no reason to stay, and if a client dies you don't have an obligation to avenge them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But…what about your reputation?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well that's up to you. What's more important, your life or your rep?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Leonie frowned. “...but you still try to help people, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, there’s nothing wrong with that. Just make sure you’re getting paid for it,” he joked. Well, half-joked. “Now let’s try that again. Shez, you mind jumping in?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh–Oh! Y-Yeah, you got it, sir!” She saluted and picked up a training sword, moving to the field to face off against Leonie.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Remember Leonie, a spear gives you more reach,” Jeralt called out, “You’ll always have an advantage against someone with a sword so long as you remember that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Understood!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt settled back, watching the two girls face off. After a moment, Byleth moved over to his side and he gave her a glance, waiting to see if she wanted to talk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Is Shez my sister?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, that wasn’t what he expected her to ask. “Do you want her to be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I’ve never had a sister. She’s nice. Kind of stupid though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt bit back a laugh at his kid’s blunt summary. “She’s not a bad kid. I never thought I’d wind up adopting another kid though. It’s a strange thought.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Hey, Shez is my sister now, right? She wasn’t my sister before?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Okay now he was just confused. “Could you explain that one to me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Some of the mercenaries were betting on if Shez was your bastard.” He nearly choked on his own spit. “Is a bastard a secret daughter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Shez isn’t my…secret daughter, kid. You’re the one that found her, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. That’s true.” She looked thoughtful, then looked up at him again. “When was I born?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…the twentieth of Horsebow?” Where was this going?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What year?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt raised an eyebrow at her sudden curiosity, then considered if he should answer the question truthfully or not. There…probably wasn’t any harm in it. It wasn’t like he’d be running into anyone from the church anytime soon. “Eleven fifty-nine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…” She seemed to be counting something from how she moved her fingers. “...I’m fourteen then. How old is Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re asking a lot of questions today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please answer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…well, I don’t know. I was assuming she’s probably a year younger than you, at least.” Well, he thought she was three years younger at first, but that didn’t seem too likely now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. So I’m older. Good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…He really had no idea what his kid was thinking sometimes.</span>

  <p>
  <span>They stuck around Sauin for a few more days. Jeralt and some slightly scuffed members of his band, the ones who needed to learn not to bet on his personal life and to watch their language around the kids, kept up on searching around for any remaining poachers while Byleth and Shez helped out with training their father’s “new apprentice”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt still chipped in with Leonie’s training, of course, but his kids made for decent sparring partners for the young girl. Byleth also took to helping with some surprising, if muted, enthusiasm. She was the one most often directing the two younger girls and she was competent enough with a lance to show Leonie how best to use it when Jeralt wasn’t available, though the redhead wasn’t especially receptive to what she saw as Byleth’s criticism of her skills.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for Shez, she was grounded. No going into the village unless it was with Jeralt and she was completely locked down to the camp otherwise. Not that she protested much. She messed up, so she was willing to take her punishment. Even if it was a really boring one.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Besides, Leonie was still fun for her to spar with, so it wasn’t like she was completely bored.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eventually though, the time to move on came,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure you can’t stay for a little longer?” Leonie asked, pouting as she looked up at Jeralt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry kid, a merc has to make a living, and we still have to go receive our payment from the count.” Jeralt said, really not feeling good about making a kid sad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then let me come with you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And who's gonna take care of your old man if you come with us?” Jeralt asked, making Leonie pause before she frowned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, come on now! No need to be sad!” Shez said, trying to cheer her up. “There’ll always be a place for you here when you grow up!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll get really strong one day,” Byleth added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I’m already strong!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Even stronger.” Leonie really wasn’t sure if she was trying to cheer her up or not…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now then, before we leave, we did have some stuff we wanted to give you,” Jeralt said, nudging his kids forward a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right! Here, it’s from Byleth and me!” Shez said with a grin, as she pulled out a training weight while Byleth pulled out a hunting dagger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I hope you like it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh, thanks!” The training weight was very appreciated, though Leonie couldn’t help but wonder about the dagger. She already had one, even if it was an old one…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And here, I made it myself.” Crouching down, Jeralt handed her a wooden charm, making Leonie beam. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Th-Thank you, Captain! I’ll make sure to take care of it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, don’t worry about it if you don’t. Just make sure to take care of yourself.” Jeralt said, with a slight smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Captain!” Leonie saluted, before looking at the two sisters. “I’ll make sure to keep you to that promise, Shez! And you better watch out Byleth! I’ll get strong enough to beat you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Looking forward to it,” Byleth said, her tone even as ever, though Shez did frown for a moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As they left, Leonie began to tearfully wave them goodbye, as the family waved back, heading to where the gold may take them.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"She needs to get her own rival," Shez said a day after they had left Sauin Village, while she and Byleth waited for Jeralt to come back with the payment from the count. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Who does?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Leonie! She's nice and all, but she was clearly trying to make you her rival and you're my rival!" Shez explained, clearly miffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm. It's okay, you're still my rival," Byleth said, patting her on the head, "And my little sister." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey, we still don't know if you really are the older one! Dad thought I was ten when we met, so he might be wrong about how old I am!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t know how old you are. You might be ten.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s been a year! I’m definitely not ten!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eleven then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez glared at her newly official sister, before glancing up when she noticed Jeralt walking back into camp. “Dad! Tell Byleth I’m not eleven!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hi to you too, Shez. Byleth, don’t tease your sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay. Why do you have a book?” Byleth asked, because Jeralt did indeed have a book under his arm. Two books, actually.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I asked Count Gloucester if he knew anything about studying magic and he gave me them for free. Well, to be specific he said they were part of my pay, but he still gave me the full price in gold too, so it was a decent deal all around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh wow. The count sounds super generous–Wait, why do you have magic books?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because I figured it was about time to follow up on the fact that you know how to use magic. It might have taken a while, but better late than never, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really!?" Shez asked, suddenly very excited. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, but you know the rules." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No practicing without supervision," Shez responded, having heard it plenty of times. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good." He handed the books over. "Now, I hope you're ready for a march, cause we're headed to Empire territory." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Why are we going there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Apparently we did a good enough job with those poachers near Sauin that Count Gloucester decided to help us out with some more work,” Jeralt answered, “He had some recommendations for what nobles might be looking for mercenaries.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, he must really like you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That or he wants some Empire nobles to owe him.” He shrugged. “Either way, it means more work for everyone, so let’s get to packing up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sir yes sir!” Shez saluted, before scurrying over to show Byleth her new books. And then get to packing up afterwards, of course.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>It wasn’t unusual for the Jeralt Mercenaries to be on the road. They were a traveling mercenary band, after all, but it was the first time they’d traveled from one nation to another while Shez was a part of their group, and the young girl was pretty excited to visit a brand new country.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe overly excited, given how much she was pestering the other mercs for details on the Empire of Adrestia.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Come on, come on, can't you tell me anything?" Shez asked as she flitted about the mercenaries. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're gonna tire yourself out if you keep moving around like that." Jeralt said, glancing back at the still moving girl. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I want to know about where we’re going! This is my first time out of the Alliance!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Heh, guess you should take your kids out more," Victor said, teasing the captain from his place in the procession. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"...Hey, aren't you from the empire?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Yeah, I used to work in Hrym territory." </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good, you can answer all of Shez's questions," Jeralt said, essentially dropping his kid on the merc. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, what's Hrym like?" Shez asked, practically bouncing on her feet. Sighing as he realized his mistake, Victor shrugged. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, don't expect much from it. Haven't been there since the emperor decided to wipe out the Hrym family."</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Huh?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I was only a guard, so I don't know all the details, but House Hrym wanted to join the Alliance, and even tried to fight for its freedom. Course, the emperor wasn't happy about that and squashed them. I decided to get out of there before things got bad." The mercenary let out a chuckle as he remembered his past. "My only regret is that I didn't loot the place before leaving." </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't make me smack you," Jeralt said with a sigh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Heh, sorry boss. Anyways, where was I…oh yeah, after the Hrym house got squashed, the other nobles weren't that happy with the emperor, leading to them leading a revolt against him. Don't know all the details about that though, other than apparently the Duke von Aegir being in charge of Hrym now." </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh wow, the empire seems like a messy place…" </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, it's not all bad. There's the opera house in Enbarr for example. I only ever went to it when I was guarding a noble, but the shows there are great. There was this one diva in particular who was amazing, they called her the divine songstress. Should try to see if she's still around, especially if she's still as hot as before." </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That last comment got Jeralt to smack him on the back of his bald head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah alright, fair,” Victor conceded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was it like being a guard?” Byleth asked. There was a slight hitch in the march as the mercenaries registered that the captain’s normally incurious kid actually asked a question unprompted. Even one of the horses glanced back at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ehh, not that interesting. I mostly patrolled the town, kept my eyes out for trouble, and took tons of bribes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were a corrupt guard??” Shez asked, sounding fascinated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh hilariously corrupt. I probably took more bribes than anyone else in the guard. Half the time I wound up getting conflicting bribes, like ‘don’t look this way’ from one guy and ‘do look that way’ from another, and I still took them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...Wouldn’t you get in trouble for that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nah, I was never caught. I’ve got one of those faces nobody recognizes, which makes it really easy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Victor, don’t teach my kids anything weird,” Jeralt warned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, they’re asking. Actually, here’s something I can tell you squirts, coming from a veteran merc to a couple of novices.” He smirked slightly at seeing Shez immediately scowl, though the real delight was seeing Byleth shoot him an offended glare. “When it comes to the battlefield, always remember that nobles are always more valuable than commoners.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Wait, why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because nobles are worth way more as hostages.” That earned him another smack from Jeralt. “Aw, c’mon, that one’s actually good to know! Nobles get upset if some commoner kills one of their type, so going for the capture is just good for living long.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were some noises of agreement from the other mercenaries and even Byleth looked thoughtful for a moment, though Shez still looked mullish.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not how you phrased that at all,” she complained, earning a laugh from the shifty merc.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t get into the mercenary business if you’re upset about shady business. Though, uh, boss, you remember that Duke guy I mentioned? Duke Aegir?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t take jobs from him. That’s just my thoughts there. Man’s a snake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jeralt gave him a glance. “I didn’t think you had principles.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got one, and that’s don’t get fuc–uh…” He glanced at Shez, then cleared his throat. “‘Don’t get cheated’, and he’s a cheat.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I’ll keep it in mind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s all I’m asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How’s he a cheat?” Shez asked, earlier annoyance turning back to curiosity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lots of reasons, squirt. Biggest is that, somehow, he winds up not only in charge of Hrym after the Emperor squashes the viscount, but is the guy to incite the insurrection. Sure, they say all six great houses were in on it, but it’s really funny he’s the one winding up on top every time something goes wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh…hey, what are the great houses? And what do you mean by ‘insurrection’? How’s that work? And hey, why do some nobles have von in their names but others don’t–”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Victor glanced at the child pestering him with questions, then turned his gaze towards his captain, who utterly refused to meet his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jeralt loved his kids, but if he had the opportunity to have someone else answering Shez’s questions…well, he considered himself a generally decent guy. Not decent enough to step in here though.</span>

  <p>
  <span>“Okay! Make sure to watch carefully! Dad says you’re my spotter!” Shez called out to her sister, who was sitting on one end of the new camp’s sparring field. There were some mercenaries around, but most were busy with their dad, out hunting down a giant wolf pack for one of the lords living in the Empire’s northeast corner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth tilted her head from where she sat, then glanced at the book on the ground next to her, titled “The Beginnings of Sorcery, A Primer on Magic; Vol 1”. “Okay. I think you should read your book first.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, that book. I can do that later! This is the magic book!” Shez held up the tome in her hands, a simple brown and gray book. It didn’t look magical, especially compared to the fancy bright red cover the primer had, which was even decorated with little silver flames in the corners.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...If you say so.” Byleth decided to pick up the primer and sat it in her lap as she watched Shez proudly face off against a very fearsome straw dummy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Behold! The power of ice!” she declared, and thrusted her hand forward. A small puff of frost poofed from her palm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth clapped, politely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“D-Don’t clap! That wasn’t–That was supposed to be an ice blast…hm…Ice blast!” That time, she managed a tiny icicle that launched from her palm and impacted the ground. “...Okay, that was maybe better–Don’t clap! No clapping!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused, her hands in position to applaud, then lowered her hands to her lap again, where they rested on the book. She considered things, then cracked the book open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The beginning was simple enough. It said some things about magic being part of the natural world, then went into how there were two major “types” of magic, White and Black. White magic was based in Faith, and black magic was based in Reason. As for what that actually meant, apparently “Reason” was magic based on a person enforcing their will on the world while “Faith” was magic drawn from and empowered by the user’s faith in the goddess.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…Shez, what’s ‘the goddess’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh?” Shez blinked at her sister, then waved her hand to scatter away the ice that had grown on her fingers. “Nh, that’s annoying…anyway, the goddess is the lady that created the whole world and everything in it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, okay. Do you need help?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I know what I'm doing! Mom taught me how to use magic!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And how long ago was that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...A few years ago, but I'm good!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay, do you mind if I read to myself?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, sure, just make sure to keep watching me too!" Nodding in return, Byleth began to read while making sure to glance up as Shez kept practicing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While it seemed this book would mainly focus on reason magic, with a small note saying to purchase volume two for a focus on faith magic, it did give a description about the differences in magic. Such as where reason magic was about channeling the magic around you, faith was about channeling the magic within you. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Continuing on, it explained that magic was a very step by step process, and that these primers would assist in shortening the time between those steps. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So I have to imagine the sigil first…" Byleth said aloud, acting like she was talking to herself instead of to Shez, whose current icicle broke apart before it could be launched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Uh…sigil…huh…” Shez mumbled, before deciding to open up her tome again, “Uhh…oh, okay, there’s different symbols…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“‘In the common school of thought, Reason magic can be divided into four major elements,’” Byleth continued, “‘Each with their own symbology’…’These elements are commonly held to be Fire, Thunder, Wind, and Ice.’”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph, knew that part already…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Shez, they have a picture of the common sigils on this page.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh?” Shez looked over at Byleth, who had held up the book to show the artistically drawn symbols in question, and despite herself, Shez immediately looked at the sigil for the most basic ice spell. “Oh, so that’s what it–Ah, w-whatever! They have fancy symbols in this book too!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know, I just thought I would show you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez huffed, a little annoyed, before turning and raising a hand. “Hm…Ice!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That time, a symbol started to form in front of Shez’s hand instead of just a shard of ice, but she still only managed a slightly larger puff of frost. “Mrrh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“‘To call upon each element properly, one must envisage the result they desire within their mind. Black magic draws upon the inherent magic of the world, and it must be channeled properly’...Huh, that’s interesting. It says for ice magic, you need to draw on feelings of the cold, and it works best for people already familiar with the concept.” Byleth glanced up at Shez, who was pretending not to listen, and then back at the book. “Also the most basic ice spell is called Blizzard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…okay…” Shez thought back, picturing cold winters on the mountains she came from, and held her hand out, keeping both that thought and the image of the sigil in her mind. “...Blizzard!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In a flash of white and blue light, the dummy was both frozen and pierced as spikes of ice erupted up from the point the spell hit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah! I did it…I DID IT! BYLETH, I DID IT!” Shez yelled, a bright, happy smile on her face at the gruesome demise of the unfortunate training dummy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good, I knew you could.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez’s face reddened before she smiled even brighter. She promptly hurried over to her older sister and grabbed her wrist to pull her up. “Okay now you do it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! I want to see what you can do!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I haven’t tried to use magic before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, and? I want to see what you can do!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth tilted her head in thought, then nodded. She had no idea what she was doing, so she might as well give it a try. “Okay. Can I have your tome? The primer says having a focus helps.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure!” Shez happily handed it over, before “subtly” taking the primer from Byleth in return so she could start pouring through it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth felt her lips twitch in some amusement at the sight, before she faced off against one of the less frozen dummies on the field. She wasn’t completely sure what she was doing, but the primer said all mages had an “inherent affinity” for one element or another. The easiest way to figure out what it was was to just relax and think of what came naturally.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So as Byleth stretched out her hand and closed her eyes, she found herself picturing flames. The warmth of the campfire beside her dad and Shez, the heat of summer bearing down on her, and the first time she saw a building lit ablaze by bandits.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fire,” she intoned, and she opened her eyes as a crimson sigil formed in front of her hand and a ball of pure flames erupted from it, impacting the dummy and blowing it apart entirely into flaming scraps of cloth and straw. “Huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WOAH!” Shez exclaimed, eyes bright with excitement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah shit!” yelped a nearby mercenary who had most definitely just been working nearby and not surreptitiously ordered by the girls’ father to keep an eye on their practice so they didn’t set the camp on fire.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If he did do that though, such foresight would’ve been very fortuitous, as the mercenary managed to douse the flames before they could set anything ablaze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suffice to say, Byleth and Shez got a bit of a lecture on fire safety.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Huh. Apparently ice magic used to be considered a type of wind magic,” Byleth noted, reading from the primer again while Shez continued practicing blasting some slightly hardier wooden dummies with ice shards. Byleth wasn’t allowed to keep practicing with those yet, mostly because Dalton, the merc that was supervising but pretending not to be, was pretty sure wood would be even worse to set on fire.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Why?” Shez asked, half-distracted, which wound up sending the ice spike flying off into the tree line. “Oh, oops.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Careful! Gertrude can fix a lot but she can’t bring an eye back if you stab it out!” Dalton called from where he was sitting and whittling some figurines. Byleth made a mental note of that; if Shez was right and she was going to take over the band someday, she should know what her troops did for hobbies, right? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hm…should she ask when Dalton’s birthday was? It might be nice to get him something–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey! By! What do you mean about the ice thing?” Oh, right.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth glanced at Shez. “I think it’s because wind is cold. Or something like that. There's also something about some people thinking the ‘elements’ line up to the Saints…hm. Dalton, what are the saints?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh? Wait, how do you not know–No, wait…yeah, okay, I guess it would make sense you don’t know. Your pops doesn’t like the church much and everyone would probably assume you already know…” The mercenary shrugged. “The Four Saints are the followers of Saint Seiros, who saved Fodlan from the evil king Nemesis a thousand years ago. They helped found the empire and did a bunch of other important stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, okay.” That made sense to her. She didn’t know who Seiros or Nemesis were, but she could ask her dad later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So what was that about the saints and the elements?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just a side note about them being associated in religious texts. It’s not very specific. There’s also some stuff about dark magic, which I guess isn’t regular Reason magic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It isn’t? Why not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cause it’s dark,” Dalton spoke up, “Speaking as somebody who’s actually gone up against a dark mage, dark magic’s nasty. It’s all about causing pain and doing damage above everything else. Though, I guess that’s true of all black magic? But you can use fire to light a fire, so…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He trailed off, thinking, while Byleth continued to read. “‘Dark magic is not inherently evil, though some hold it to be the natural opposite of the light of the goddess. Where light may heal as well as harm, darkness is meant solely to damage and thus is the favored art of spellcasters intent on reaching new heights of power and destruction’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oooooo, that sounds really cool!” Shez immediately said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, even if it sounds cool, you should be careful. That type of magic can also be called curse magic, and I don't know about you two, but that seems like it can backfire." Dalton piped in as he finished a figurine. "And even then, it's pretty rare. The church isn't exactly a fan of it, so it's not easy to find info on it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, seriously?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, it's not exactly banned, but it’s frowned on.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm." Frowning a bit, Shez focused back on the dummy and began to think. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez?" A bit confused, Byleth looked up at her younger sister as she stood there for a moment, before seeing Shez raise her hand. And, rather than the white sigil that appeared before, a purple one appeared and a single, dark spike launched forward, missing the dummy as it lodged itself into a tree. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes! By, look! I did–" Was as far as Shez got before the spike suddenly exploded, sending chunks of wood flying all over as the three of them instinctively ducked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a second, Dalton popped his head up first. He stared at the blackened ruin of what once was a decently sized tree. The wood wasn’t even burnt, that he could see; it looked more like it had somehow been leached of life, leaving behind withered, dried wood where it was struck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A second later, Byleth took a look, followed by a sheepish-looking Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dalton stared at the ruin for a few more seconds, then looked at the purple-haired girl, who winced and ducked her head. “...You know I’m going to have to tell your pops about this, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...do you have to?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked back at the blown apart tree. A butterfly landed on one of the pieces of blackened wood and immediately turned to dust. “Yeah. Might need to get a priest too…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suffice to say, again, Shez was banned from using dark magic after Jeralt got back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though, when he did get back, the captain/namesake of Jeralt’s Mercenaries had some interesting news to report.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re going to be heading to Enbarr for a bit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Enbarr? The huge city?” Shez asked over dinner, staring at her adoptive father in curiosity and confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, the capital of the Empire. We’re going to be escorting a merchant caravan. I wouldn’t normally bring us around a capital, too much chance of getting caught up in some noble, royal, or imperial nonsense, but it’s paying a lot and…” He looked sad for a second, at least to Byleth’s eyes, before he tried to smile. “It’s something I’ve wanted to do. I hope you two don’t mind–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No way!” Shez beamed, eager and enthusiastic. “This is going to be great! I’ve never been to a city, and especially not a capital! I heard Derdriu, back in the Alliance, is enormous! Oh, but it’s by the water and–Wait, is Enbarr by water?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth watched her younger sister launch into another volley of questions for their exasperated father and felt a slight smile come to her face. She was getting better at those these days. Though…she felt a little curious for once. Why did her father look sad? What was in Enbarr that he wanted to do?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Did it have something to do with her mother?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t asked more after learning her mother’s name. It looked like it hurt her father to talk about, and she was content to know that little bit about her, but…if there was a chance Sitri had something to do with Jeralt’s melancholy, then Byleth was going to find out about it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It just felt right to do.</span>

  <p>
  <span>The Empire was certainly interesting. It felt more…imposing than the Alliance. Something about the architecture, the people, the land itself…the air felt almost intense as their band traveled along with the merchant caravan they were hired to protect.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth hadn't been paying much attention to the overly similar villages when they were in Leicester, but Adrestia definitely had her attention. It might have something to do with the insurrection that happened a few years ago, but she noticed there were several armed knights on patrol along the roads, especially around as they neared the major cities of the Empire. Major cities like Enbarr. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was the first time she had been in a capital city. The buildings were big and blocky, and some of them felt strangely ancient. The whole city had a feeling of age to it. Old, but strong. And completely filled with people.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt overwhelmed from the moment they entered, and when she heard that her father decided she and Shez had to stick by him if they wanted to walk around, she was thankful. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granted, they couldn't really do that when he was getting drunk, such as the previous night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That wasn't the important point though. What was important was what he had mentioned when he was drunk. When she had gone to check on him, she had overheard him talking with another mercenary, where he mentioned he had been planning on traveling to Enbarr before, specifically to the opera with Sitri. To the Mittlefrank Opera Company, the place Victor had mentioned, the one with the “Divine Songstress”. They wanted to go, but then Sitri died, so it never happened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As such, Byleth decided that not only she would disobey her father, she would go out with only shez, so they could buy tickets for the opera as a surprise for him! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you sure you know where to go?" Shez asked as they walked the streets of the capital. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I made sure to get directions." Byleth's answer did little to ease Shez as they continued to walk, the younger sibling continuing to glance around. "You okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…yeah, just feeling kinda weird you know? Some of the people around here are strange." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How so?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…you ever just look at someone and they just give you the chills?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…well, can we just hurry up then?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded and took Shez’s hand, earning an annoyed noise from the purple-haired girl. “You don’t need to hold my hand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do if you’re nervous. Papa–...Jeralt did that for me, so I’m going to do it for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Why’d you call him Jeralt?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should be professional. We’re family, but he’s also my captain, so I need to get used to being professional when we’re around important people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Alright.” Shez shrugged that off, though Byleth could feel her tense for some reason. The blue-haired teen gave a small glance around the crowd. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were a lot of people walking around, but the clothes in general were nicer than she was used to seeing. Lots of people wore those square hats scholars had, there were plenty of guards in full plate and even heavy armor, and most people were wearing the crimson colors of the empire. Even the clearly poorer citizens in brown or beige clothing seemed to like adding a splash of red to their clothes in the form of sashes or belts to mark their allegiance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then there were the strange people in black clothes and bird masks. Those did stand out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That didn’t necessarily mean they were evil and the reason Shez was getting a bad feeling, but Byleth did make a mental note of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Greetings, you lovely young ladies." Cut in a voice, breaking Byleth from her thoughts. Looking over, she saw a man who seemed somewhat older than the two of them, who was likely a noble with how well made his clothes were. "Would you care to join me for some tea?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We're busy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Too busy for tea? I’m sure that cannot really be true. Tell me, what are two lovely young ladies doing out on their own anyway? Running errands for your parents, perhaps?” He smiled. It looked unpleasant. “Perhaps I could assist you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth moved in front of Shez. She was being quiet, and Byleth could tell she was still tense. “I must respectfully decline, sir.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It would be ‘my lord’, not sir.” The man held his arms behind his back and smiled again. Now that Byleth was seeing it, she knew what Shez meant about a smile not reaching someone’s eyes. “And I decline your declination. Allow me to be clear, young lady. Either we finish this conversation with you accepting my offer, or I, a nobleman of the noble house Korsch, will call the guards with evidence that you have stolen from me. As you seem woefully ignorant to how things work here, I will be blunt and state they will believe me over you every time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded. “Understood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then in one smooth motion, she drew the dagger from her waist and drove it up through the soft part of the man’s abdomen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His eyes bulged, but she pulled back and stabbed up again, harder, before pulling the knife back and wiping it on the nobleman’s coat. She took Shez’s hand and walked away with her in tow. She kept her ear out to see if “Lord Korsch” managed to say anything, but all she heard were some desperate, pained gasps before he collapsed and a nearby woman screamed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned towards the scream, affecting a look of curiosity at the sight of a nobleman bleeding out on the ground, and when the guards quickly came by, one was nice enough to hurry her from the scene with a mention that it was something “children shouldn’t see”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good work looking disturbed,” Byleth complimented as she walked away with Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…how did you do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t ask too many questions while we’re still in public,” she cautioned, before glancing up at her taller, yet still younger sister. “He was dangerous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but…you just…did that? Without hesitating at all? A-And how didn’t we get caught??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m still not that tall.” For some reason, that admission felt…annoying? “He wasn’t especially big, but he blocked the view of the nearest guards instead of keeping them in his line of sight. He probably knew they wouldn’t approve, so his first instinct was to hide what he was doing. His words implied he knew what he was doing though, so I think this wasn’t his first time trying something like this. Either way, I’m wearing dark clothes right now, so there was less of a chance of any blood spatter showing up. The second stab was risky though. I should have been more careful even if his clothes were thick enough to catch most of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked at her. “...Uh…huh. Do you…think about things like that a lot?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. It was a little stiff. She wasn’t used to shrugging. “I listen to people. I’m not good at interacting with them, so I just listen to the mercenaries in camp sometimes. Ezra used to be a ‘hired knife’ before he did official mercenary work, so I asked him to show me the best places for stabbing someone. He likes violets, so I gave him one and he was fine with the idea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you bribed one of dad’s mercs to show you how to stab people better?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In case something like this happened.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stared at her. She didn’t let go, and she didn’t stop walking, so things were probably fine. “Huh. You’re gripping my hand kind of tight, By.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sorry.” She loosened her grip and glanced up at her sister. “Better?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez smiled. It reached her eyes. “Much! Hey, so where’s this opera place anyway? We’ve been walking for a while.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It shouldn’t be much farther. We need to buy ‘tickets’ first. I don’t know why we can’t just pay at the door, but that’s what Candace said.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you know everyone’s names?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I try to. You said I’m going to lead when Jeralt retires. So I’m going to be a good captain and know everyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, sounds good to me! It might be hard to do when we get more people though. Oh, and just for the record, that’s twice you’ve saved me now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Hm…yeah, it is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That means you’re ahead of me, and I’m going to have to catch up!” Shez stated, clenching her free hand into a fist as she smiled. “So you better be ready! Next time, I’m saving your life!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her smile dropped into an annoyed look. “Feh. I’m not going to say you should be more excited, but I can tell when you’re just humoring me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You do! You totally do! You’re smiling right now!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Huh. So she was.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Jeralt sighed. “I really shouldn’t be encouraging this. I told you two to stick by me when you wanted to go out into the city and you completely ignored that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but it turned out fine!” Shez said, her hand in Jeralt’s as she and Byleth pulled him along, “We got fancy opera tickets and there wasn’t even any trouble!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There was some trouble,” Byleth admitted, her hand also in Jeralt’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He gave her a glance. “What kind of trouble?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Trouble. I can explain more later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sighed. “Trouble you can’t discuss in public then, sure. Alright, I’ll keep quiet for now. You two need to be careful though, this is a dangerous city. From what I’ve been hearing, some noble was even knifed earlier today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh, uh, yeah, heh, uh, that’s something that did happen, yup,” Shez muttered, looking nervous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Kids, please tell me you didn’t knife a noble.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What? Uh, um…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We didn’t knife a noble,” Byleth stated, before pulling him more insistently, “Come on. We have to be there for the opera.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt felt like he should follow up on that, if just to make sure his kids weren’t about to get arrested. “...Why are you so insistent on going to the opera anyway?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You didn't get to go before." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I heard you talking yesterday, when you were drunk." No longer pulling at him to follow, Byleth looked up at Jeralt. "You wanted to go with mom, but weren't able to." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Starting to think you two kids are too good for me."  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, the best dad deserves the best kids, no?" Shez said, smiling up at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that your way of saying you're going to behave from now on?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eeeh… let's not get ahead of ourselves now." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I guess that's the best I'll get." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It will, now come on, we gotta move, these tickets were expensive, so they have to be good seats!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were, in fact, no seats at all. While the Mittlefrank Opera Company was indeed open to the public, there was a difference between the noble and commoner sections. Nobles had booths above the commoners, their own private sections where they could enjoy the play in comfort. The commoners, meanwhile, had an open area in front of the stage that they were meant to crowd around in. And since many of them had been waiting around before the opera had started, it meant the three of them were near the back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Frowning, Shez did her best to look over the shoulders of the people in front of her, barely able to glance over, while Byleth had already resigned herself to being unable to see. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alright, get on up," Jeralt said, grabbing onto the two to lift them up onto his shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey, what are you doing?" Shez asked, clearly embarrassed as she tried to steady herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It'd be a shame if we came all the way here and you two weren't able to see anything. This old man can at least hold you two up for the show." He might be getting older, but he was still strong enough to give his girls the best view he could give.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth, meanwhile, seemed pleased at being able to see the stage, especially as the performance had begun. The narrator began to speak, telling everyone about the tale of love and tragedy that was about to begin. The story of two young lovers forced to fight on opposite sides. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And while Byleth couldn't follow the story completely, she couldn't help but feel…sad as it went on. It was the tale of a young knight and a noblewoman, the daughter of a viscount, who first met as students at a monastery. The two became close, first friends then lovers, joined together under the same house, yet the knight lived in service to a baron who hated the lady’s family. The feud had lasted long, but only came to true blows after one insult too many saw the baron’s son dead and the viscount blamed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The baron, who treated the knight as a son, was wounded by the viscount in the battle that followed, and the knight, in an attempt to defend his lord, killed the viscount then and there. Stained with the blood of his lover’s father, then young man was hailed as a hero and adopted into the baron’s family, yet the noble lady, now a viscountess, burned with hatred for she knew not the name of the man who murdered her father, merely that he was a knight adopted by her family’s most hated foe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Banners were called in vengeance and the lady took the field. This time, the baron was slain and his castle sieged as the vengeful viscountess called for the head of her father’s murderer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The knight, now a new baron, decided the only way to soothe the flames of her hate was to face her in such a duel. Armored fully, his identity hidden, he declared he would fight, if only she would spare those of his household. But no, she spat, she would never rest until she saw all of the Baron’s blood dead and buried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And thus, the duel was fought, and the knight did die.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Only when he was struck down did the viscountess remove his helm, intent on seeing the face of her father’s murderer and only finding the visage of the man she loved instead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The final song was her elegy for the lives lost in hatred, and a promise that never would she seek the end of the baron’s line, for though hate burned hot, vengeance was cold and empty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And the curtains came to a close as the fire illuminating the stage was slowly put out. Silence fell upon the opera house, before it was suddenly broken by thunderous applause from the audience. The lights came back on as the curtains rose, the actors lining up to bow together as flowers began to get thrown at the stage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The actress playing the heroine in specific got a lot of attention, apparently someone called Dorothea, “the Mystical Songstress”, based on what everyone around them was saying. Despite how far they were from the stage, Byleth couldn't help but notice that, without the veil covering her face, she looked much younger than Byleth had assumed, as if she wasn’t much older than her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though before she could look for much longer, she felt her father set her down, the older mercenary letting out a grunt as he rubbed his shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Didn't expect for the play to be that long," Jeralt said as they were let out. "Did you girls enjoy that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, it was nice, I guess?” Shez replied, “I didn't really understand what was happening, but the singing was nice! Oh, and so was the swordplay!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It was very nice, but sad," Byleth said as they headed out of the opera house. "The lead actress was pretty." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Huh?" Jeralt and Shez both asked, completely stopping in their tracks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm?" Glancing back, Byleth tilted her head in confusion. "Is something wrong?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no, it’s just–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You think she’s pretty??” Shez asked, an odd grin creeping up her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah? She’s pretty. She has a nice voice too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez’s smile was far too wide. Jeralt, meanwhile, let out a sigh. “Right, never thought this day would actually come…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You two are acting weird,” Byleth noted, before turning to head back to the camp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey so what else do you like about the singer girl?” Shez asked as she walked next to her sister, keeping pace and still smiling at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Um…she has nice hair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What else??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Why are you asking?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because you like her! You think she’s pretty!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Yeah, I guess. I don’t know her though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah but that’s how it starts in all the books! You see a pretty girl from afar, your heart starts beating fast and your face gets red and then–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright Shez, don’t pester your sister,” Jeralt said, putting a hand on her shoulder and steering her away from Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw! But this is big! Byleth never said anyone was pretty before, this is definitely important!” She peeked around her dad, looking at her bemused sister. “Hey By, you should get her a flower! Oh, what kind of flowers do you think she’d like?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t understand what’s going on right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can talk back at camp,” Jeralt said, “In fact, you two still need to tell me what trouble you had to deal with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Shez’s smile immediately dropped. “Uh…heh, um, maybe we should keep talking about–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She tried to pull away and Jeralt’s grip tightened. Not too hard, but enough to keep her moving along with him instead of scurrying off. “Come on Byleth. We can talk about your interest in girls afterwards.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, okay.” That seemed strange to talk about, but alright. Were girls even that interesting?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth considered the question as she headed back to camp with her family, and found her thoughts drifting back to that girl on stage. She was kind of interesting, now that she considered it…Hm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something to think about later.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>So. So. So so so.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So Jeralt’s kids had murdered a noble in broad daylight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>More specifically, a creepy, predatory noble had accosted his girls in the middle of the city, a thought that nearly caused Jeralt’s hand to crush the mug he was holding in his grip as he recalled Byleth’s description of events, and his quiet, thoughtful, unemotional kid had driven a knife into the creep’s stomach. Twice, for good measure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, Jeralt was not a man opposed to killing. He would be the largest hypocrite in the entire world if he said he was. He was, however, well aware that certain people were considered less okay to murder than others. Bandits and outlaws might have been anyone before they decided to take up theft as their career path, but that choice of theirs meant they were fair game to any merc looking to make some coin off of their bounty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nobles, on the other hand…They weren’t off-limits, not on the battlefield where anyone could die from a stray arrow or bolt, but Victor wasn’t wrong when he said nobles got upset at their own dying. And one of their own dying in the middle of their capital city, where they should be safe?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He let out a slow sigh, then glanced to the side as a scruffy, brown-haired man in leathers and a cloak sat beside him. “Well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well no one’s pointing to your girls as possible suspects, at least around the lowdown types,” Ezra said, raising a hand to call the bartender over, “I made a few suggestions that this Korsch guy ran afoul of someone with means to act on a grudge, in case it helps. Apparently he was a shifty type to begin with, the brother of some count’s vassal doing the usual brown-nosing courtier stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…did he work in one of the ministries?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think so, but as a paper pusher at best. Might need to wait until Vic gets here to be sure, but little By didn’t pick the worst way of doing things. A noble gets stabbed in broad daylight and it’s not obvious who did it, people assume an assassin, not a kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. Don’t I have you to thank for her knowing how to do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ezra shrugged as he received his mug of mead. “Well if you want to actually thank me, I won’t say no, captain.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt just sighed, massaging the bridge of his nose. “...Thank you for teaching Byleth how to gut a potential threat and get away with it. You’re still in deep shit for things turning out like this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can accept that. Worse comes to worse, blame it on me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not doing that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One man can get away a lot easier than a whole band, captain.” Left unsaid was how unlikely it was that man could survive on his own, hunted by the Imperials.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I said that’s not going to happen. You’re not going to the noose for helping. I might break your jaw later though. Just a warning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for the forewarning, captain. And hey, at least I’d get to spend more time with Gertie if you do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt raised an eyebrow. “Really? You and her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe? We’re seeing how it goes–Oh, hey, there’s Vic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt turned his gaze towards the second of his mercs he’d sent out. The bald, bearded man looked surprisingly weary, and didn’t greet him as he sat down and ordered an ale. Jeralt waited for him to down the drink before he spoke up, despite the sudden tension he felt in his shoulders. “Bad news?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Terrible news…ah, not about the girls though, that turned out better than I thought.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt felt some tension ease, though he still frowned. “You mind explaining?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, I asked some of the guards. Subtly, of course–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ezra snorted and Victor shot him a look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Gonna ignore that. Anyway, I asked, from one former corrupt guard to some currently corrupt guards, what the story was with the stabbed noble. We’re mercs, we get interested if there’s coin to be made on vengeance missions. Now, half the guys I asked had no idea what I was asking about, and the other half barely gave a damn. Yeah, there was some talk of a minor noble being stabbed, but only four guys even knew his name, and when I asked for details, an account of me being a curious guy who likes to know the gory stuff, one guy tells me he’s sure it’s some gang with this weird scorpion mark, another thinks it’s some inter-ministry business, and the third’s blaming it on a jealous lover. As for Mister Four, he tells me a bit about what he saw and even mentions pushing two kids away from the scene, but he’s convinced it was done by someone from Brigid!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt blinked. “...The island?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! Well, I think it’s an archipelago when it’s a bunch of islands, but yeah! Only one guy remembers there being kids anywhere nearby, and he didn’t even consider they could’ve done it. Now we could still kill him if we have to–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re not doing that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah that’s a shit idea,” Ezra said, “They’ve already got explanations for why this noble died, we kill a guard and suddenly it looks like a cover up and people will start looking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah, damn, that’s true.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, so the girls might be in the clear,” Jeralt noted, relaxing a little. He did give Victor another curious look though. “What’s the terrible news you were talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that. Right, so, you know how the insurrection happened a few years back? And Duke Aegir’s been holding the reins ever since?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, just a few days ago, the new imperial heir was announced.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt blinked. “The new heir? They needed a new one?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, see, the Imperial Family has been under house arrest since the insurrection, right? The emperor and his kids were all under the ‘dutiful protection’ of the Prime Minister while things were settled. And that stupid bastard somehow let them all die.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor sighed, nursing his drink. “They’re saying a plague hit the palace. Somehow, some way, the heirs caught it and started dropping like flies. Like that shit in Faerghus. We’re talking about eleven princes and princesses, all completely healthy before this, and all except one of them dies. The new crown princess, Edelgard von Hresvelg.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Goddess,” Ezra cursed, his brow furrowed, “All but one of them? How does that even…Saints, that’s insane.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re telling me. I can’t say I have a lot of love for the Emperor for what he did to Hrym, but Saints and Stars, his kids didn’t deserve that. Not that it’s stopping some pricks from saying the goddess sent the plague as divine punishment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ezra leaned back in visible disgust while Jeralt let out a sigh. He tried not to think of his own kids. “...Aegir didn’t have anything to do with it, did he?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor scoffed. “Don’t get me wrong, captain. I hate the guy as much as anyone, but he’d be deranged to let the imperial heirs die. He’s got his own boy and all the rest of the ministers have heirs and spares. The smart thing to do would’ve been to divvy them up, guarantee a royal marriage to anyone going along with his plans and tie their families to the Hresvelgs tight enough that the imperials would never get loose. Letting them die, or, Goddess forbid, killing them himself would’ve been shooting an arrow straight in his own foot. This is as bad for him as it is for anyone else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Well, it’s not like we could do much even if he was involved.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Amen. Bastard should at least have the courtesy to resign in disgrace though. Hell, I’m surprised I haven’t heard about Marquis Vestra killing himself. Then again, the rat did turn on the emperor to begin with, so I doubt he will.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does the Marquis usually kill themself if something happens to the royal family?” Ezra asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Imperial family, and there’s a pretty famous story about it, actually. One prince a Vestra was sworn to died in battle and the Marquis burned himself alive in penance. After killing and flaying the men responsible, of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Adrestians are insane.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Faerghans ain’t much better!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t start this again,” Jeralt warned the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor grunted. “Fine. Still, we should probably move on, captain. Aside from it just being a good idea in general to not be near the scene of the crime, we’re probably not gonna see a lot of work around here. All the nobles will be focused on getting favor with the new crown princess, and we can’t help with that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I suppose…Do you know how she is?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. Being a dad does soften you up some, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt just gave him a flat stare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, I can actually see the resemblance between you and Byleth when you do that. Anyway, the poor girl’s apparently still sickly. Her hair’s all white and the Duke ain’t letting her out of his sight. Or at least not the palace. Probably doesn’t want his last shot to pass away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt felt like sighing, but…at the end of the day, there just wasn’t anything he could do. The princess might have it rough, but she wasn’t his problem. “Alright. Come on, let’s get going. Ezra, you’re paying.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Consider it a way to make things up to me.” He pushed himself up from the bar and headed out to leave, ignoring the way Victor stuck his tongue out at Ezra. Somehow, his kids were the least childish people he had to deal with on a day to day basis…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, even if his men didn’t think there was a problem, a part of him still felt some concern that the death of a noble would suddenly catch attention, even interest. That someone would see this sudden death and decide it needed justice. And it was a truly terrifying thing to think of “justice” being aimed at his kids…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fortunately for Jeralt and his nerves though, the news of Lord Korsch’s death was completely covered in the following week by something far more important.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dagda and Brigid had just formed an alliance, and invaded Adrestia.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Shez had never actually experienced a war. She’d been in fights, sure, and she’d seen skirmishes, but wars were different. Wars were bigger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wars meant, even if you weren't involved, you would get dragged into it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After what had happened in the capital, Jeralt had decided to play it safe and lay low for a bit. Which meant when the war began, they weren't near any of the major cities, and as such did not know it had started. Until one day, when they were packing up camp, a group of Brigid soldiers, a scouting party as Jeralt would later describe them, stumbled upon their camp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next few moments descended into utter chaos as Dalton, the closest person to them, noticed some were injured and approached to ask if they needed help. His goodwill was met with a sword to the chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez couldn't tell exactly what happened after that, other than a lot of blood was shed. Even Shez and Byleth were unable to stay out of it, as the duo found themselves crossing swords with a soldier, who seemed surprised that two young girls were able to keep up with them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth lunged in, deflecting the tanned man’s sword and attempting to stab straight through him, but he was surprisingly quick and moved back before the blade could land. Shez watched for a moment as her sister fought the foreign soldier, who moved with a nimble quickness she hadn’t seen before, when she noticed another man of Brigid pin Ezra to the ground and raise a knife.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was moving before she knew it, swinging her blade down at the Brigid man’s head, but he moved quickly, just like his friend, and lunged for her, stabbing forward rapidly with the sword in his other hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez felt herself falling back, trying to keep steady under a flurry of blows as Ezra yelled something. She thought she saw him trying to get up, but his leg was bleeding, and Shez was on her own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t scared, she was sure she could handle it, but each blow jarred her arms and she was getting pushed back more and more as the man sported a jaunty smile. “I am respecting your skill, girl. I will give you a death that is quick.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And suddenly his other hand came around, the knife stabbing straight for her eye, and when she raised her sword to block it, his sword…hit something.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then coughed. She couldn’t–Something happened to the air in her lungs and she couldn’t–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shh. Spirits shall take you now. Lay you to rest,” the man said, before pulling back his sword, dripping with blood, and swinging it straight for her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Not yet. You’re not dying yet.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His sword never reached her head. He stumbled back, blown by a sudden force as Shez felt strong, stronger than she’d ever felt before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man said something, something she didn’t recognize, and it felt warm all around her. There was something glowing by her head and another sword in her hand and she moved without thinking, a scream erupting from her mouth as she cleaved the man in half.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then she passed out.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Shez blinked awake sometime later, in…the infirmary tent, from what she could tell. She’d been in there enough times to recognize it. Her shirt was off and she could feel bandages around her chest, which was weird because she felt fine. Maybe still a little sleepy?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a strange feeling for a moment there, as though something tried to well up, before it suddenly receded, leaving her…more confused than anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sat up, then paused when she noticed Byleth was by her bed, her eyes closed as she rested on a chair. The blue-haired girl was holding a sheathed sword in her arms, for some reason, and as Shez leaned over to poke her face, her eyes immediately opened. “...Oh, good, you’re awake.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez leaned back as Byleth suddenly thrust a canteen in her face. “Drink.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now that she was thinking about it, she was really thirsty…So after downing as much water as she could in one go, then going back for some more, Shez finally felt that her mouth and throat were no longer dry and she could speak just fine!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So what happened? Did we win?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think the camp would still be standing if we lost.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah, that is kind of a stupid question…Um, where’s dad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Talking with the Varley man.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The who now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A knight from some nearby noble, Count Varley. Papa–Jeralt’s talking with him about work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez pouted. “You don’t have to be professional when it’s just us two!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a good habit to get into. Dalton’s dead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh. Oh, huh.” Shez settled back. “That’s…huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now that she was looking, she did notice there were more beds filled than usual in the tent, and she could see Gertrude talking with some healer guy she didn’t recognize.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. The…I think they’re called Brigidians, started the fight by slashing him. By the time anyone got to him, he was already dead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. That sucks. He was nice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” And that was all there was to say. “The Varley soldiers said that there’s a war going on. Dagda and Brigid joined forces to invade Adrestia.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow…um, who are Dagda and Brigid?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Some foreign countries. Brigid is an…archipelago, according to Victor. I don’t know much about Dagda, just that it’s farther away and bigger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can’t say you’re wrong there, kid, or that I know much more than you,” Jeralt said as he walked over to them and took a seat by Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez immediately brightened. “Hi dad!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey kiddo. How are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great! I’m not sure why I’m even bandaged, I feel really good!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because you were stabbed,” Getrude called out, before turning back to her conversation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, what she said.” Jeralt sighed. “I’m glad you’re okay, Shez. You were out of it for some time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well like I said, I'm totally fine now!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Well, if you say so. We can talk about it more later. Just try to get some rest, okay? The knight out there isn’t giving us a lot of time to get ready." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"For what?" Byleth asked, a bit curious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We've been 'hired' to help defend Varley territory," Jeralt said, glancing over to see the new healer leaving the tent. "From the sounds of it, they aren't giving us much of a choice." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As Victor puts it, Varley is a coward, and is very willing to throw anyone under the carriage if it benefits him. As such, if we don't agree, we'll likely end up being called bandits and get attacked," Gertrude piped up, deciding to sit down too as she got a bit of rest. "Though it's better to defend a coward than get sent to the front lines, I suppose." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's one positive, though I'd prefer to just leave the empire entirely and head back to Alliance territory to avoid this whole mess." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If only it were that simple. And for some reason, I'm also getting the feeling this job won't pay much." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can't we just leave? I mean, they can't force you to stay, right captain?" Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There's too many injured for us to leave fast enough. Even if we can get away, we'd end up losing too many people in the process." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Will we have to fight more of those Brigidians?" Byleth asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hopefully we won't, but we'll see." Getting up, Jeralt began to leave the tent before addressing Byleth. "Make sure she doesn't try to get up before we leave." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, today has been a mess," Getrude said, getting up as well. "I need to smoke. Call me if anyone wakes up."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And after she left, Shez felt Byleth hold her hand, gripping tightly. This time, she didn't complain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How are you doing, By?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Better." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry I worried you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They started calling us things." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The Brigid people, they started calling us something. Candace said they were saying something about ‘demons'." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really? Did we get nicknames?!" Shez asked, almost excited until she saw the look in her sister's eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't like being called a demon." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused and reconsidered saying she thought it sounded cool. “Hm…well I’m fine with it, so I’ll be the Violet Demon and you can be…um…what’s a good name…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re too silly to be a demon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey! I can definitely be a demon!” She paused. “Wait, why am I a demon anyway?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You started glowing and cut a man in half.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “I did? Huh. That’s weird.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yep.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, did you start glowing too?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. I just…sort of…killed every Brigidian between me and you when I saw you collapse.” She glanced away, maybe a little sheepish. “I think it was maybe six of them…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. Does that count as you saving me again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Shez, don’t get competitive over this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m just asking!” She did, however, make a mental note that she was going to beat Byleth’s record in whatever their next battle might be.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>War was surprisingly boring.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe it was just where they were situated, but Shez had to admit to being bored more often than not. The Varley County was far up in the north of the Empire, closer to the Alliance than the sea, so the forces of Brigid and Dagda didn’t make it up there as often as she expected from that first encounter. They did still have to fight some groups, but they were mostly small scouting parties and Jeralt and Byleth were usually the ones going after them while Shez stayed back on “guard duty”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t think that was entirely fair, especially since it meant she couldn’t try catching up to Byleth, but By was fifteen now and that meant dad was more willing to take her along than Shez, who still insisted she probably was as old, if not older, than her sister. Though she hadn’t won a spar against Byleth in a while…Well, either way, the downtime meant she had more time to practice her two sword style at least, which she was getting really good at!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something about it felt really natural to her, like it was just easier using two blades than one. She could still use one just fine, but something about two felt better. Ezra said something about her being “ambidextrous”, so maybe that had to do with it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Either way, she did still see some combat over the months, especially since they moved around. They were under contract with Varley, but that didn’t mean they couldn’t go fight in other territories that needed help. Apparently the count even encouraged it, since it made him look good to “lend his strength”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Brigidians she already knew a bit about from that first fight, so facing off against the quick moving islanders who tended to hold their blades in reverse grips and wore light clothing was something she got used to pretty quickly. The Dagdans were definitely rarer to fight and she usually had to hang back against them because they tended to be heavily armored and wielded weird spears called tridents. There were also apparently some skilled archers on their side, but she never went up against them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And thanks to Byleth stepping up more, there hadn't been any more losses on their side. People still got injured, but her sister proved to be quite the tactical genius. To the point that some of the mercs were already treating her like a second in command! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That being said, it seemed like the war was rough on other fronts, with an entire noble house seemingly being wiped out. Not that people seemed to mind, with some saying they deserved it for siding with the emperor during the insurrection. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But, it seemed the empire was going to be launching a counterattack, with a different count apparently leading the charge. Shez didn't know counts could lead an army, but she wished they could work for him instead of Varley. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Speaking of, it seemed that thanks to both Jeralt and Byleth, they were being invited to be congratulated by the count himself. Jeralt wanted to go by himself, but Varley had apparently asked for the 'Demons' to come with him. Which, on the one hand, she was getting recognition for her deeds, which was nice. On the other hand, she had been trying her best to get people to stop calling Byleth a demon so she was disappointed to hear the moniker stick. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regardless, Shez found herself being led into the Varley estate, standing behind Jeralt as she did her best to be professional. Everyone was wearing some fancier clothes than usual because apparently that was a thing nobles wanted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Presenting His Lordship, Count Gregoire Von Varley!" announced a knight, standing at attention as they looked up at the landing above them. Moments later, a purple-haired man looked down upon them, eyeing them all with mild interest and contempt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You must be Jeralt the Blade Breaker then." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, your lordship, you honor us with your presence," Jeralt said, with a practiced tone as he bowed towards the count. Byleth followed suit and Shez did so as well, though she lagged behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, and those must be the 'demons' I've heard so much about. Are they truly your daughters?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, your lordship." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, it seems you've trained them well. My daughter could learn a thing or two for them." Shez suddenly found herself imagining a female version of the count glaring down at them and tried not to grimace. It would probably look bad. “You’ll forgive me if she does not join us. She has a weak constitution, and I can’t begin to imagine how dealing with people of your persuasion may affect her frail heart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…That sounded like an insult. Shez wasn’t sure how, but it did. And now she was wondering how long she was supposed to keep her head bowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I understand completely, your lordship.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I doubt you do. Nevertheless, you have served my land well in your time here by handling that rabble that somehow made it this far. It’s madness to think Ochs and Nuvelle failed so miserably as to allow forces all the way to my territory. You have my gratitude. Now do be off, I have others to honor today and I really must move right along.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt straightened. “Pardon me, your lordship, but there is the matter of our pay for aiding you in this trying time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Varley sneered. “You’ve been paid already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No we haven’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt’s immediate contradiction earned a scowl from Varley. “Ridiculous! Are you trying to say I am not a man who pays his debts? You’re just trying to extort me, and I will not have it! Guards, remove this rabble at once!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The guards moved, then everyone froze at the sound of Jeralt cracking his neck. The Blade Breaker leaned his neck to the other side, letting it pop again, then rubbed a hand to it. “Sorry about that. I was getting stiff keeping my head bowed. Kids, let’s get going. We shouldn’t trouble the count with our presence anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...S-See that you do,” Count Varley said, trying to get the last word in as Jeralt turned and left, with Byleth following him immediately and Shez trailing after with a frown on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, dad, why didn’t you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not worth it to deal with a man like that. We have to pick our battles, Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But this means we’re not getting paid at all!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not by him, no. It’s why I’ve been charging the towns we’ve been helping. I never mentioned we had a contract with the Count to anyone, so as far as the people in his territory are concerned, we’re just ‘heroes’ that helped out. For a decent rate, of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Huh…Hm. But we can’t do anything about the Count?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not everyone is going to be Gloucester, Shez. We can’t expect decent pay from every noble, but we can spread word around that Varley’s bad to work for.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So where next?” Byleth asked, completely unphased by everything that happened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Next, we’ll probably head west. We’re getting out of Varley County, and…it might be best to wait for Bergliez to handle the main part of the fighting. Things must be a real mess in the west if the enemy managed to get past the mountains…that or they came up from the southern coast, but I think there’s another Count in the way down there…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez glanced at her dad as he started muttering under his breath, then spared another look back at the Varley castle. She was tempted to make some kind of rude gesture, but it would probably be a bad idea. Especially since she was pretty sure she spotted someone spying on them from a window…</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The Dagda and Brigid War, as people were calling it, wrapped up pretty neatly all things considered. The king of Brigid, Donnacha Macneary, was killed in battle by the War Minister of Adrestia, Count Leopold von Bergliez and that essentially ended everything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez wasn’t sure if she’d ever need to know the details of stuff like that, but it did mean the war was over. More importantly, it was Byleth’s birthday again, and Shez sprung for something nice!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“‘The Beginnings of Sorcery, Volume Two’,” Byleth read from the cover of the yellow book. Like the first volume, it had little decorative bits at the edges of it, but this time they were lightning bolts instead of flames! “Huh. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome! That one’s supposed to be all about Faith and Light magic, like the stuff Gertrude uses!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Behind them, Jeralt couldn’t quite hide a wince, but thankfully Shez was distracted talking up how impressive her gift was, and Byleth was distracted by Shez. He knew, at some point, Byleth was probably going to interact with the faith of the goddess, but…He was probably being paranoid to even consider it a bad thing, right?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Shez remained completely ignorant of her father’s concerns and much more interested in prodding Byleth to start trying out spells from the book.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…can we?” Byleth asked, glancing up at her father.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…I suppose it should be fine. We’re not exactly in a great place for it though.” That much was true. They didn’t have a full camp set up for the night because they were currently passing through the Oghma Mountains. Specifically the part that separated the eastern half of the Empire from the West, which was far enough south from the monastery that Jeralt actually felt comfortable going there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, we can set up a couple dummies near the edge of a cliff and let By give it a go,” Ezra suggested, uncaring of the annoyed look Jeralt gave him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! Come on dad, please?” Shez pleaded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt would’ve stood firm, but then Byleth looked at him too and he caught a hint of longing in her eyes, so a few minutes later, Victor and Ezra finished setting up a pair of training dummies near a cliff’s edge, far enough away from the camp that there wouldn’t be any more accidents, and aimed out into the distance so Byleth couldn’t possibly bring the mountain down on them. It might’ve been paranoid, but Jeralt felt his concerns were reasonable enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay! Ready?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Just reading. This book is interesting. There’s a lot more about drawing the power from within you instead of–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah yeah, that sounds really interesting, but I want to see what you can do!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth gave her sister an annoyed look, then decided to just flip ahead to the more combative spells. She wanted to show off…which was a weird feeling. But she knew what Shez would enjoy seeing, so she picked out a spell that looked powerful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let out a slow breath and raised her hand, taking care to aim towards the dummy, and focused. If she’d been thinking a bit more, she would have considered using Shez’s tome for a focus, but as it was, she just let the magic gather. Which was more magic than she would have expected. A lot more magic, suddenly surging up as though it was waiting for her, and she felt as though she couldn’t stop herself as she intoned the word: “Seraphim.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A brilliant, gleaming sigil formed in front of her hand before a blast of golden light launched from her palm. The orb it formed soared forward as though on wings of light, ripped straight through the dummy they had set up, and went flying off towards a distant mountain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Eisner family and their gathered mercenaries watched the ball of light shrink as it disappeared into the distance, before a dim flash in the distance heralded its impact into the side of the mountain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“THAT WAS AMAZING! HOW DID YOU DO THAT!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth had a second to turn before Shez tackle-hugged her, and she felt a smile come to her face as her excited sister showered her with praise for her feat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Jeralt, meanwhile, turned to Victor. “...No one lives around there, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no one should. There’s…some villages, but they’d be on the other side of the mountains, nowhere near the impact.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...It might not be that bad,” Ezra said, before noticing part of the mountain appear to start crumbling in a landslide. “...We should move camp.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine with that.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Shez couldn’t stop smiling as she settled in that night. Sure, Jeralt did decide to move the camp for some reason and they had to march a bit, but after that, she and Byleth were allowed to keep on playing–</span>
  <em>
    <span>practicing</span>
  </em>
  <span> with By’s new magic book! Just no big spells, unfortunately, since they already broke one dummy and their dad had a rule about how magic practice ended whenever a dummy was broken beyond use.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm…” She settled into her blankets, which felt nice and cozy in the cool mountain air. “Good night, By!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good night Shez,” her sister replied, settling into her own cot beside Shez’s.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good night dad!” Shez called out, then giggled when she heard Jeralt snore in reply. She really did have it good. She didn’t think she’d have a family again, not after mom, but she really was just…happy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A part of her did still want to beat Byleth though. Maybe she should try learning more dark magic? Then she could be the Violet Demon and Byleth would be the…Ashen…light, thing…Dragon? Dragon might work, she did use fire too…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez yawned, then let herself drift off. It was important to be well rested…especially if she wanted to win against Byleth again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps I could help with that?” offered the strange white person in a void of floating–...</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What.”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>"Did you not request help-" Was about as far as the white person got before Shez tried to punch them in the face, only to end up going through their head. "My, how rude." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey, who the heck are you!?" Shez asked after catching herself, keeping her guard up as she faced the strange being covered in weird…weirdly familiar markings.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not even an apology, hm? Well, if you wish to call me something, you can call me Arval," Arval said, then they continued, "I am the one who saved your life some time ago." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? You saved me? When did that happen?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you truly not remember?" Arval asked, a bit surprised. "It was during the fight where you were stabbed. I gave you my power so you would not die." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, are you talking about the glowy thing?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I would not put it in such simple words, but yes. Were it not for me you likely would have perished that day." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, uh…thank you?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh my, so this is what it feels like for someone to show gratitude, it is quite pleasant." Arval said, looking very pleased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, I'm not trying to be rude, but what exactly is going on? I'm pretty sure I didn't fall asleep in a void earlier." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, that is quite simple. We are currently in your mind," Arval explained, making Shez blink as she looked around. Some rude people said she was empty-headed, but she didn't think that was literal… "And I have called you here so we can speak. To be specific, I have been trying to call you for some time, but it was quite difficult setting up this connection." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh. So, not that I'm not grateful or anything, but why exactly did you save me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That is because you are a crucial piece to the world's cyclical nature." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...the world's what now?" Shez asked, making Arval sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"To put it simply, this is your destiny." And that got Shez's attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, so I am destined to do something? What is it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That… I am not certain. All I know is that it is your destiny and I am here to help you with it. But one thing is for certain, that desire to grow stronger than your sister is what helped call me to you, and what I believe will help you fulfill your destiny." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? So you mean Byleth really is my destined rival?" Shez asked, feeling very excited. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I believe so…while I do not know what exactly your destiny is, I can feel it deep within myself that defeating her is key for that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, okay? So I just need to beat her in another spar?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No, not quite. I don’t believe that is my meaning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I’m not going to fight her for real, I don’t want to hurt her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You do wish to surpass her though, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, then I get to be the older sister again!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval stared at her for a few seconds, then sighed deeply as they placed a hand against their head. “I do not know where to even begin with that assertion…Fine, whatever your reasoning, your goal is clear. Surpass your sister and prove yourself better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, okay. You’re not really saying anything I didn’t already know though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval just stared at her again. “...Perhaps I should have waited for you to be older…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I’m fourteen, that’s more than old enough to beat Byleth!” Shez declared, then paused. “Ah, wait, no, that would make Byleth older than me since she’s sixteen now…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...She would already be older than you by the basis of being a year older–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, quiet! I can only be the older sister if I don’t acknowledge stuff like that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you are aware of your denial of reality then…Never mind. Just know that I will always be at your side, my partner in destiny.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then Shez woke up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That was a weird dream,” she said, sitting up in bed and glancing over at Byleth. “Ha! Woke up earlier than her again!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is everything a competition to you?” Arval asked, before raising a hand, “Peace, partner. Please do not scream out of nowhere and awaken the entire camp.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re real?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course I am real! What in the world made you think any of that was not real?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, dreams are weird. One time I dreamt I was a fox. I think Byleth was a wolf? And dad was–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you focus, please?” Arval sighed. “Of all the people in this wide world, how is it I came to be partnered with an unfocused child?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey! I’m not–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mrh? Shez?” Byleth blinked awake, before sitting up, tiredness turning to alertness as she looked at her sister. “What’s going on? Is there trouble?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no, I just–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahem.” Shez paused as Arval cleared their throat. “Partner, far be it for me to tell you what to do, but perhaps do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> mention my existence to the sister you seek to defeat? You need every advantage you can get, after all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah but that’s stupid, of course I’m telling By about you,” Shez replied, before turning back to Byleth, “I’m talking to this weird white person I saw in my dreams. Their name’s Arval.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth blinked. “Huh…Shez, are you being haunted by a ghost?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Am I?” Shez glanced at Arval, who had their face in their hands. “...I might be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We should tell dad then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I picked the wrong time to contact her,” Arval muttered to themself as they watched their partner in destiny hop up from her cot and start shaking her dad awake. To be fair to themself though, they really did not consider their partner would be this stupid.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“So you had a strange dream, and now the kid from that dream is hanging around?” Jeralt asked over breakfast, currently portioning out some of the stew for his kids.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm hm!” Shez answered while in the middle of eating.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright then. And is he saying anything weird?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think they’re a he? They’re like…kinda not a boy or a girl?” Shez shrugged, before helping herself to another spoonful of broth. “Mm! Oh, and Arval just says it’s my destiny to beat Byleth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahhh. So they’re saying it’s your destiny, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup! So you better watch out, By! Because I’m gonna beat you next time we spar!” she declared, pointing her spoon at her sister beside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can try,” Byleth replied, before simply grabbing her bowl and downing the remains of her soup. “Mm…More please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C’mon kid, you’ve gotta leave some for the rest of the camp,” Jeralt chided, before turning back to the pot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth pouted, before jerking slightly when Shez poked her cheek. “Hey, what kind of dreams do you have? Any weird ones?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess. I usually dream of wars and stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooo, any cool wars?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I cannot believe any of this,” Arval, meanwhile, muttered from nearby where they were watching the family at breakfast, “He did not even ask any real questions! Well, I suppose that is to our benefit, but honestly, should he not show at least some concern for his daughter supposedly hallucinating??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt, meanwhile, was internally panicking. Not too much, he was used to taking care of a kid most would consider unusual, but he also thought that his adoptive daughter wouldn’t have sudden issues like hearing voices and seeing what sounded like ghosts. Or, well, one ghost of ambiguous gender.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>How did that even work? She dreamt of a ghost and now she’s seeing it? Should he be worried? Was this just another weird Shez thing? The girl had funny ideas about destiny, so maybe she just made up an imaginary friend! But, wait, did fourteen year olds have imaginary friends? He was three hundred years old, he had no idea what being fourteen was like! Much less a fourteen year old girl!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Should he get Gertrude? This wasn’t a health thing, was it? Though, no, no, telling Gertrude was premature, it might be something strange but benign like Byleth’s heart…Goddess, maybe it was something like that. Shez started glowing back in that first ambush with the Brigid folk, maybe she had some kind of…magical bloodline? Did that make sense? It didn’t seem like Crests or…Was Shez a baby dragon??</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, dad? I think the soup’s boiling,” Shez pointed out and Jeralt cursed under his breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yeah, looks like, I’ll just move it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay! Make sure to use your gloves!” she warned just half a second too late as Jeralt gripped the pot’s handles with his bare hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Jeralt was a strong, seasoned warrior. He knew how to handle pain. That was why he carefully set the pot down without spilling a drop. “...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hey, um, dad? Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Just fine. Give me…one second. I need to check the perimeter.” Jeralt moved towards the edge of camp, his reddened hands splayed because trying to clench them was pure agony. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, Byleth, and Arval all craned their heads to watch him leave, before the sisters settled back while the “ghost” raised an eyebrow at his departure. “Strange. Why would he be walking off into the woods–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The scream of pain and deluge of curses that echoed out a second later answered that query quite succinctly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suffice to say, the family did wind up visiting Gertrude in short order, though not for Shez.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Jeralt might have had a tumultuous relationship with the Archbishop, but he was perfectly happy to praise the Goddess for healing magic. By the time his group had made it out of the mountains and to the next village, it was like his hands had never been scalded at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He made a mental note to give Gertrude a bonus next time he divvied out the pay. First and foremost though, was getting supplies at the village. While the village was a bit too close to Garreg Mach for his own preference, it was a rather bustling place, which meant they could get what they needed easily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You must be the leader of this band of men," the village headman said as Jeralt checked the supplies they had purchased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Did you need something?" Jeralt asked as he turned to look at the man. "We were planning on leaving tomorrow, but if you have a job for us, I'd be happy to hear you out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha, that won't be necessary. I just wanted to make sure you were all okay, there was a rock slide that happened not so long ago, so I was wondering if you faced any troubles on your journey." At the mention of the rock slide, Jeralt did his best to remain even-faced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So that's what that sound was. I had thought it was a giant wolf raising a fuss." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thankfully no, but even so, to think such a tragic accident would happen near here…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Jeralt almost didn't want to ask. "What accident?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The rockslide I mentioned. Lord Arundel perished in it." The headman let out a sorrowful sigh. "To think such an honorable man would lose his life like this…may the goddess protect his spirit."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt, to his credit, was able to keep calm on the outside. On the inside however, he couldn't help but feel immense dread at that news. Had…Had his daughter accidentally assassinated the Empire’s regent?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, but if you don't mind me asking, where are you headed?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"To the kingdom," Jeralt said without hesitation, "The recent war is making mercs crawl out of the woodwork, so it's hard to find work." Well, that was believable for a lie he made on the spot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aaah, well, we do have some furs to sell if you want. The kingdom can be quite cold, so I'd recommend you bundle up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We'll take what you have. Haven't been to the kingdom since I was young, so it’s probably going to take some getting used to again." As they exchanged pleasantries, Jeralt spotted Victor nearby, so he excused himself to talk to the merc. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Change of plans, we're headed to the kingdom." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh? What the hell, why are we headed over there?" Victor asked, very clearly not pleased with having to head towards Faerghus. The only response he got in return was Jeralt muttering 'it happened again' as he brushed past him. </span>

  <p>
  <span>Thales of Agartha was many things. A powerful sorcerer. An immortal sage. The eternal leader of the only true humans in the land of Fodlan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And, at the moment, a curious mix of irritated and overly proud of himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The pride was understandable, given he finally had his Flame Emperor. The blood of that filthy beast’s consort may have once called themselves “emperors”, but it was by his hand that one of their ilk had become a true force to be reckoned with. One that would strike down the spawn of the Fell Star and bring the Agarthan people back to the world that was stolen from them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The irritation was also understandable, given that before he could bring forth that most glorious of reckonings, he had to pose as one of the beast’s so-called “nobles”. Which meant instead of traveling instantaneously from one location to the next through the might of magic and technology, he had to travel in a damn carriage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You seem sour,” noted his companion for the journey, thankfully one of his people instead of those aggravating vermin he was forced to play politely with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it unreasonable to be? The beasts’ means of travel are as primitive as everything the abomination has a hold on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pittacus shrugged, her shoulders bared by the black gown she wore. Black-painted lips curled in a small smirk beneath her veil. “I would think you would be happier, Thales. Or should I call you Volkhard in this shape?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bah! I hear enough of that name from the degenerates trying to earn my favor,” he sneered, leaning back in his seat in the shape of that all too convenient “lord” he had overtaken. It should have been difficult finding a host of appropriate height and shape to wear properly, but it seemed fortune favored the true humans in just how convenient it was that “Lord Arundel” had a sister married into the imperial family. Thales may be a masterful manipulator, but he was not one to disregard the factor of luck in having favorable conditions arise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thales it is then. Still, you shouldn’t scowl. It may mar the face you’re using.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He scoffed. “Nonsense. A guise of mine will never have any imperfections. Though I won’t disagree that I should be more joyful.” He let his lips curl into a smirk of his own. “It won’t be long now before Cleobulus upholds her end of the plan and puts an end to that ‘kingly’ bloodline the northernmost beasts crowd around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And what of the Alliance? I don't seem to recall you mentioning any plans there." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if I need to do anything there. Those pathetic beasts keep squabbling amongst themselves, barely held together by even the thinnest loyalty. With how half of them support the empire, it will be easy to keep them under our thumb once my Flame Emperor takes the stage." He allowed himself to chuckle at the thought. “Ah, though perhaps I’ll have someone handle that ‘sovereign duke’ of theirs. Myson has been bored keeping watch on the region, hasn’t he?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Myson gets bored whenever he isn’t allowed to play with those crest-altered beasts of his,” Pittacus complained, “You think he would be happy with consistent results, but he insists he can push the projects faster and further.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Far be it for me to quell a man’s ambitions. As long as he doesn’t start naming his projects again and keeps them from going too wild, I don’t particularly care what he does with filth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, we can always let the wilder ones loose on the vermin. It’s only natural for larger beasts to devour the smaller creatures, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Only natural indeed.” Thales, wearing the face of Lord Volkhard von Arundel, laughed with a dark humor as his carriage trundled onward through the Oghma mountains. “Just as it will be only natural to see these lands returned to us once more. For it is our time to rise again, and reclaim all that was stolen from us!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His mouth curled into a vicious smirk, though he did raise an eyebrow when he noticed Pittacus’s lack of response. In fact, the woman was inclining her head for some reason. “What are you doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I thought I heard something. Actually…do you hear that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hear what? I don’t hear–” And that was when several tons of rock, stone, and loose soil crashed down on Lord Arundel’s carriage.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>It had been centuries since Thales last felt agony on such a level. Slowly, blearily, he opened his eyes and attempted to focus. His vision was blurry and he felt the warm trickle of blood leak down his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What?” he muttered to himself, his eyes adjusting to a darkness he was far too familiar with. In front of him, he saw Pittacus. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His fellow Agarthan was no longer sitting in her seat. No, she was instead splayed out across the floor–no, the ceiling; the entire carriage had flipped. Her mouth was open in a look of utter shock at her own demise, her veil lifted to show unseeing eyes and her white hair loose around her head in a tangled mess, already stained with her dark blood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she was most definitely dead. The massive stone staked through her chest saw to that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thales breathed, slowly. His guise was still in place. He couldn’t focus on a warp though. He would have, were it not for his clear concussion. If he tried as he was, the likelihood that he would wind up split to pieces between here and his destination was far too high. Which wouldn’t be a problem, if the only damn medic around wasn’t dead on the floor in front of him!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He snarled and kicked her across the head in a moment of petty, vindictive anger. “What worth are you as a healer if you can’t even bother to live!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No matter. He would survive. He was Thales. He always survived.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took some effort to extricate himself from the carriage, but even a landslide couldn’t trap him. The driver to his carriage, some worthless peon, had been splattered across the trail. Not important either though. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked back to the wreckage of his transportation, then up at the mountainside that had tried to claim his life. “Hah. Ha! You see this, Fell Star? I cannot die! Not even nature can end my vengeance!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He grinned through bloodied teeth, then raised a hand. Ebony and crimson magic swirled about his hand before he clenched his fist and wrenched it down, calling on his own mastery of the earth to bend it to his will! And with it, both the carriage and the evidence of his presence were buried even further.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sure, some hint of the broken remains were still present, but he had assuredly flattened what remained of Pittacus. No need to allow the vermin any hint of his kind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha. I would thank you for your service, but you did prove truly worthless in the end,” he commented, before turning with a callous laugh, “I’ll be sure to let the people of Agartha know just how ignominious your end was–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Far above Thales, amidst the broken rocks of the cliffside, a single, large boulder still remained unfallen, yet perched precariously atop one small outcropping. Without any external force to act upon it, this boulder would have likely remained in place for untold ages, a curious part of the landscape hanging like a sword above the heads of passersby. As it was though, the powerful magic of Agartha’s great leader shook not just the parts of the mountain he wished to break, but the parts nearby. Which meant the large boulder went from precariously perched to falling over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite his centuries of alterations to his own body, Thales was, at the end of the day, still human. And when a very big rock falls onto a human head, no matter how self-important the mind inside it may be, the result is always the same.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Such came the ignominious end of Thales, leader of the Agarthans.</span>

  <p>
  <span>"The cold sucks!" Shez said from where she was bundled up in several furs while the mercenaries set up camp for the night. It had been some time since the team had arrived in the Kingdom, and much like a clock, Shez made sure to announce to the camp her displeasure each day at nearly the same time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm." Byleth agreed, fairing a bit better than Shez, as she handed over some stew to her sister. Though it seemed the younger merc wanted to use it more to warm her hands with the bowl rather than eat it. "Jeralt says we'll be in a city soon." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Will it be warmer?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...The walls should help with the wind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez groaned, pulling her furs closer around herself. “Why’d we go up north in the Fall anyway? Isn’t it supposed to snow up here around Winter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably. I don’t remember ever going up here before. Maybe when I was really little?” Byleth shrugged, the motion coming a little more naturally to her these days. “I can ask Jeralt later. Victor said Jeralt’s from here, so maybe that’s why we’re visiting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It sounds really weird when you call dad by his name.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I told you why I do it–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still sounds weird.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth sighed while Arval floated above the bunch of them, watching with some amusement. “I have to say, being unable to feel cold seems like quite the boon right now. Oh, and you do know your adoptive father is lying about his reasoning, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez glanced up at the strange being with an annoyed frown, prompting them to continue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I cannot help it if I happen to be better at listening than you are. Regardless, your captain-father seems quite convinced your sister, who, I might add, you have not attempted to defeat yet, assassinated another noble. Speaking of, what does he mean by ‘another’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Byleth stabbed a noble in Enbarr for being creepy,” Shez explained, prompting Byleth to glance at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you speaking to Arval again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. They’re curious about a noble you assassinated.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think it counts as assassination unless it’s politically motivated. Ezra was arguing with Victor about that.” Byleth tilted her head, thinking. “Victor says you have to be a noble to be assassinated, but Ezra says it’s about motivation, not status.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. You think Ezra’s ever assassinated anybody?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He most definitely has,” Arval commented while Byleth shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably. He seems particular about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t talk about people when they’re not here,” the potential assassin in question commented as he tossed some logs on the fire pit. Shez immediately made a happy noise and moved closer to it, prompting a grin from Ezra. “Careful there. Furs are warm, but fire can still catch on them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be careful!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Ezra, did I assassinate the noble back in Enbarr?” Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you killed him, there’s a difference,” was the immediate response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s the difference?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Killing is just the act of taking a life in general. It can be in self-defense or the defense of others, so it’s slightly more justified than murder, which is committing the criminal act of killing another, usually in a premeditated way. Though I guess spur of the moment does count as murder too, but I think we can use the ‘is he a prick’ qualification to say he deserved it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re really pedantic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez didn’t intend that as a compliment, but okay. “...Hey, you’re from Faerghus, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed I am! Rowe territory originally, in fact.” He grinned at the girls while grabbing a bowl of stew for himself. “Feel free to ask me anything you might want to know!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, okay. Why does Gertrude call you ‘Dove’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And how about we stop talking now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How is the kingdom?" Byleth asked, trying to keep the conversation going. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I haven't been here for some time, but I doubt it's changed its values. It's a lot more traditional than the other nations, got a big focus on knighthood, honor, and all that." Ezra explained as he began to eat. "You know, pledging yourself to some lord and then getting sent to die for them. 'Honor in death, dishonor in defeat' and such." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Were you a knight?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was a squire, and if I did become a knight, I likely wouldn't have joined this merry band. Though that path fell away when the knight I worked for decided to make me do his dirty work, and then threw me to the wolves when he got found out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, sorry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha, there's no need to apologize. I managed to get away with my life, and learned I'm way more good with a knife than a sword and shield." Grinning, Ezra continued. "Besides, now I get to travel around Fodlan."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well if you want to travel so much, you could point us towards where the money flows best," Getrude said, sitting down next to Ezra and taking his half-empty bowl of stew from him to eat from it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...well, we should avoid Galatea territory then, even the noble family there struggles financially. Gautier territory might be worthwhile, but that's on the ass end of the nation, and would mostly be defending against the Sreng, assuming they give us any work." Thinking for a moment, he continued. "Gaspard territory might be good. Haven’t met him personally but while I was in Rowe, I kept hearing about how well-loved Lonato was."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that sounds like a good idea then!” Shez said, “You should definitely tell dad that! I don’t think he really knows where we’re going.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Neither of the older mercs would say it outright, but she wasn't wrong there. It wasn't the first time that the Captain had changed plans, but this was the first time he did so without a new destination in mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, I know where we're going," Jeralt said as he walked by. "Just because I haven't been to the kingdom for a long time doesn't mean I don't remember how to get around." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's not what I meant and you know it!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Before you start arguing," Ezra cut in, getting their attention. "I was just saying Gaspard territory might be a good idea, it's almost winter, so unless there's other mercenaries over there, we probably won't see much competition. If nothing else, we can probably get some rooms there, which is better than camping out in this cold." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I second that idea!" Shez announced, not raising her hand as she kept them in the furs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, well, I'll keep that in mind," Jeralt said, already fully planning on going to that territory. "If nothing else, buying thicker clothing there would be good." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly, captain. You can never been too warm when it comes to winters in Faerghus.” Ezra paused while Jeralt walked off to handle travel plans. “Well, unless that warmth is coming from frost sickness, then you’re just dying.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Frost sickness?” Byleth echoed, sounding curious. Well, more curious than her usual neutrality.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yep. It’s also called a cold fever. It’s when the cold seeps too far into your bones and tricks your mind into thinking it’s actually hot. I remember this poor bast–ah, this poor guy, when I was younger, who started ripping his furs off, thinking he was overheating. He went running off into the snow and we found his body a day later, completely frozen through.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah,” Shez murmured, her eyes wide, “That’s pretty scary…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You bet it is. Folks around here like to tell tales of the Winter Lady who walks in the blizzards, tempting wayward travelers to nestle into her bosom where they slowly freeze to death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. She sounds like a jerk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s winter, Shezzy. The Goddess tests us all when the cold comes around.” He chuckled, before tossing another log on the fire. “Still, she’s generous enough to give us fire, so we can keep warm even in the times furthest from her light. That, and pegasi, so we can actually travel when the snow’s deep. Well, women can travel, they’re notoriously skittish around most men.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Why’s that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Something about a maiden’s fair heart soothing their wild nature?” Ezra shrugged, then glanced at Gertrude with a slight grin, “Maybe you oughta ask Gertie, I’m sure she’d know much better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know better than anyone here that I don’t count as a ‘pure maiden’,” Gertrude chided, making Ezra’s face immediately redden.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, not in front of the kids.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That earned a full eye roll. “You stab people for a living, but you get indignant if I talk about ‘bedroom affairs’ in front of the girls?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s not appropriate, is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Are you talking about sex?” Shez asked, and Ezra nearly choked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gertrude talked to us about it already,” Byleth explained, which didn’t really seem to help all that much. “Jeralt asked her to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I swear, men can be ridiculous,” Gertrude muttered, “Ask them to split a man’s belly and watch his guts spill and all he’ll ask is how much you’ll pay him to do it, but start talking about ‘womanly matters’ and suddenly they discover squeamishness.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think it’s more Papa–Jeralt didn’t know how to talk about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s been raising a girl for sixteen years, Byleth, and adopted a second one. He should’ve been planning ahead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think dad did plan ahead!” Shez spoke up, a grin on her face as she figured everything out, “After all, he planned for you to do it for him, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Damn, I can’t refute that.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The journey to Gaspard didn’t take too long. The roads were still largely clear of snow since true winter hadn’t hit yet, and the region wasn’t too far from the Kingdom/Empire border. Jeralt wasn't really one to visit the Kingdom for one, as aside from his own past, the lands weren't exactly the richest so work for mercenaries wasn't that common. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That being said, it seemed the people of the territory were faring rather well, and were rather happy to greet the mercenary band. As for Gaspard himself…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Greetings, you must be the leader of this band of mercenaries." A rather well-aged but still healthy looking old man greeted Jeralt when he was allowed into the manor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That I am, thanks for meeting us like this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have no reason to turn away guests." Lonato said with a smile, before he looked over to the side where he noticed two young girls. "And who is this?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My name is Byleth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heya, name’s Shez!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt tried not to sigh at his daughters’ introductions. "My apologies, it's their first time in the kingdom so they're not used to the cold." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to explain, the winters here are quite cold, and as a father I can understand wanting to keep your children warm and healthy." Lonato's smile kept on his face as he approached Jeralt. "Now, am I correct in assuming you're here looking for work?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Or at least permission to stay nearby until the winter ends." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, well as it just so happens, there have been some demonic beasts causing trouble nearby." Nothing Lonato's forces couldn't handle, but he wasn't about to let a father and his kids out in the cold. "The pay might not be much, but there are a few empty houses we can lend you and your men while you stay here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Is there somewhere we can go to hash out the details?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We can write up a contract in my office. As long as your daughter's don't mind waiting here?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No worries dad, we'll be good!" Shez said, sending off the leader of the group as the two girls stayed behind. "Well, he seems nice." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah." Byleth said, nodding as she settled into the chair she was in, before she seemed to notice something. "Who's there?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A-Ah, s-sorry!" A young boy's voice was heard, apologizing at having been caught peeking at the two. Looking over, Shez saw a gray-haired boy, younger than her, looking at them from around a corner. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, hey, are you the old guy's kid?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez don't be rude." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I-If you mean Lord Lonato, then yes. I'm his adoptive son, Ashe," the young boy explained, sounding very polite. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well it's nice to meet you Ashe!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A-Are you mercenaries?" he asked, still a bit nervous. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That we are! You're looking at two of the strongest members of Jeralt’s Mercenaries!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You still haven't beat Ezra in a fight,” Byleth commented. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez’s confident smile immediately fell into an annoyed pout. “You don’t have to tell him that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s good for you to be realistic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And realistically, I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>going</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be the strongest, so it doesn’t matter if I say it ahead of time!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But if I'm going to be the leader, shouldn't I be the strongest?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Th-That's because you're the brains! A leader doesn't need to be strong, but they do need to be smart! You agree, right Ashe?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"U-Um, w-well, in ‘Loog and the Maiden of the Wind’, Loog was the strongest, so he was the leader, while the Maiden was the smarter one, but wasn't in charge." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Huh. So wait, does that mean I'll be the leader?" Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Guess I'll have to be the stronger and smarter one," Byleth decided. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wh–Hey, no fair, you can only be one of them!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"U-Um, s-sorry to interrupt,” Ashe interrupted, “But I wanted to ask, if you're mercenaries, have you been traveling around?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Oh yeah totally, we've been all over the Empire and the Alliance!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"R-Really? Have you done anything heroic?" Ashe asked, very interested in hearing anything they had to say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, Byleth and I have done plenty of hero stuff! Like the time we saved that one girl…uh, what was her name?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Leonie," Byleth answered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, her!" Grinning, Shez patted an empty seat. "Come on, I'll tell you all about it!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh, sure!" With an eager smile, Ashe sat down, ready to hear the story. Normally Byleth would have spoken up to correct Shez when she started exaggerating what the two had done, but…she and Ashe were having fun, and she'd hate to be rude to the son of their client. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As such, Byleth just sat by as Shez regaled the younger boy with tales of their adventures, from their rescue of Leonie to their brief excursions in the Dagda and Brigid War. Though, to hear Shez tell it, one would think they fought against Dagda’s greatest generals instead of some bands of scouts and possible deserters.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, it was entertaining, kind of. Ashe seemed very interested, but Byleth was more enjoying just how excited Shez was to talk than the actual content of her stories. Which is probably why she was more aware of the large, broad-shouldered man that peeked into the room than her younger sister was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez didn’t even stop talking, too caught up in her tale of their “adventure through the mountains” to notice, and Ashe was completely enraptured, so it fell to Byleth to raise a hand in greeting to the new person.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had short, dark hair and looked a lot like Lord Lonato, if younger and clean-shaven. He had the same kind smile as the lord too as he raised a hand in return, before moving slowly and carefully to a nearby seat, not making too much noise to avoid interrupting Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–and Byleth even brought down an entire mountaintop!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, really??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup! That’s why she’s the Ashen Dragon, the most powerful mage to ever live!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked, a strange feeling of surprise hitting her at Shez’s new title for her. It was…nicer, sort of, than being called a demon…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My, how very impressive!” the new man said, applauding Shez’s tale and making her stiffen for a moment in surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Christophe!” Oh, so that was his name. And Ashe clearly recognized him based on his happy reaction to seeing the large man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, hello Ashe! I see you’ve made some new friends!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh, right, um, Christophe, this is Shez–” He gestured to Shez, who waved back with a bright grin once she decided this new guy seemed nice. “–and Byleth. They’re Sir Jeralt’s daughters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sir Jeralt? Sir Jeralt…ah, I think I know who you mean, though if I’m correct, it would be Captain Jeralt, not Sir,” Christophe corrected, “He’s a mercenary, not a knight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh right! Ah, s-sorry about that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, it’s all fine! So, you two were keeping my little brother company?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, our dad is talking with your dad about contract stuff!" Shez said with a bright smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aaah, so I'm guessing we'll be seeing more of your group around here?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh for sure! We’re gonna be helping clear out demonic beasts! And probably other stuff, depending on what type of problems you have around here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see, well if your tales are any indication, we can probably leave it all to you two," Christophe said with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We probably could!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, Christophe, weren't you supposed to arrive earlier?” Ashe suddenly asked, “Nathan and Alice wanted to say hi to you before they went to sleep." For a brief moment, Christophe's smile faltered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just some issues the Western Church needed help with. I'll make sure to make it up to the two of them when they wake up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure they'll be happy about that!" Though before the conversation could continue, Jeralt and Lonato returned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Christophe? When did you arrive?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just now, father,” the knight said as he stood, a smile returning to his face, “Forgive me for not going to see you immediately, but I saw Ashe had made some new friends and I wanted to hear the tales of their daring adventures.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lonato chuckled with a warm smile on his face. “Ah, you have no need to apologize, my boy. Though I do think it may be time for certain young people to get to bed. It is quite late already after all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ashe ducked his head, a little embarrassed. “O-Of course, Lord Lonato.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The lord sighed, fondly amused. “I’ve told you before, Ashe, you can call me father.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ashe turned a little pink at the suggestion while Jeralt headed over to his own kids. “Alright, c’mon, up you get. Lord Lonato was generous enough to give us an actual house to stay in for the night, and your old man needs his rest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! If you’re an old man, Jeralt, I wonder what that makes me?” Lonato joked, before smiling again, “And the house is yours for as long as you wish to stay in Gaspard. I would hate to leave anyone out in the cold once Winter starts in earnest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I don’t know if we’ll be around here that long…but thank you for your hospitality.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is no trouble at all. Have a good night, all of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks again, Lord Lonato!” Shez said, waving to the old man as her dad led her away, a gestured copied by Byleth, much to Jeralt’s surprise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Well, if the kid has a good feeling about him, maybe we could stay a while,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he considered while taking his kids over to the house Lonato indicated to him earlier. One of the lord’s knights led the way, and Jeralt couldn’t help relaxing a little as he walked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After their problems in the Empire, he could do with relaxing for a bit.</span>

  <p>
  <span>Their time at Gaspard territory had certainly been peaceful; aside from the occasional demonic beast, there hadn't been much fighting for the mercenary band. Not to say that they didn't work; even when they weren't fighting beasts, they went around town helping out. Be it simply helping out with carrying something, or going out to hunt, the mercenary band had easily situated themselves into the town. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth and Shez in particular were often seen with the children of Lord Lonato. Ashe and his younger siblings were often enraptured by Shez’s grand tales, while Christophe would take the time to train the young duo when he was there. Apparently the young knight was quite impressed with the two, to the point that he suggested they enroll in the Officer’s Academy, an idea that was quickly shot down by Jeralt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When asked why, he made two simple points: 1. The Officer’s Academy is expensive to join and despite the mercenary band’s success, it would certainly eat into their coffers to try sending both Byleth and Shez there, and 2. He wasn’t comfortable leaving his daughters alone while he and his band continued to travel, and he highly doubted the Academy would be okay with an entire mercenary group staying in their town for a whole year.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez readily accepted the first reason, while Byleth was satisfied with the second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is a shame though, I’m sure they would do excellently there,” Christophe noted as he watched the girls train in Lonato’s yard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, they’d probably do great anywhere,” Jeralt admitted, “Call me overprotective, but I just don’t like the idea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Say no more, I completely understand. We have to do what we can for our families.” There was an oddly wistful expression on the younger man’s face, one that looked a little out of place. “And, if I am being honest…while I enjoyed my time at the Academy, I can’t say I entirely agree with everything the leadership espouses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Careful there, Christophe. I’m not big on faith, but saying something like that could go very wrong for you depending on who you voice it around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Christophe just grinned though. “Not to worry, Jeralt. I had a feeling about you, that’s why I voiced it. I’m a more cautious man than I seem, I assure you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure you are, pal. Sure you are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their talk turned to more pleasant topics after that, much to Jeralt’s relief. He didn’t like the church, and he could understand it if Christophe didn’t like it either, it’s just…there was something in the way the younger man voiced his opinion that raised his hackles. Still, he put it out of his mind soon enough in favor of focusing on working through the winter. His band had hunkered down in Gaspard well enough, so there weren’t any concerns about anyone freezing, though they did have the occasional venture out into the surrounding territories for other jobs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was on one of those trips that they got the news about King Lambert. The king of Faerghus was dead, and Jeralt couldn’t help but wonder if it was just his luck that crap like this kept happening in every country he visited. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A call to arms sounded out, to massacre the people of Duscur for their apparent transgression. It wasn't long before news of Duscur being annexed to the kingdom arrived in the territory, but for the people of Gaspard, the tragedy had yet to end. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Wow, I don't think I've seen anyone fish up that much, even in the summer," Ashe said, looking astounded at Byleth as she carried a pail full of fish in one hand while leaning her fishing rod on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, By has always been weirdly great at fishing," Shez said, not even trying to be competitive there since she didn’t even like fishing herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Fish are good." Was Byleth’s response as they continued walking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah but it's not like we're low on supplies or anything, so you don't need to get so much." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm-" Coming to a sudden stop, Byleth’s eyes snapped forward. "...Shez, wait here with Ashe." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? By, what's up?" Letting go of the pail and rod, Byleth ran forward, leaving the two behind her as they let out a surprised yell. Arriving at the town, Byleth’s eyes narrowed as she saw several armored knights around Gaspard, with many townsfolk shrinking back and whispering to one another at the sight of them. What caught her attention however, was the amount of knights at the manor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, you there, don't move!" called out one of the knights who spotted her. Based on his movements, it was clear he was going to detain her. Not hesitating for a moment, she charged past him, slipping under his arm as she ran towards the manor. "H-Hey, stop her!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thankfully, despite not being as fast as Shez, her smaller stature meant Byleth was able to move around the knights before they could stop her as she arrived at the manor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"-u, stop what you're doing!" Came Lonato's voice from upstairs. "There's nothing here!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rushing upstairs, Byleth pulled out her sword and came to the sight of Lonato standing in front of Ashe's siblings as they cowered behind him, while a knight stood in front of him, making sure he didn't move. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Release Lord Lonato,” Byleth calmly ordered, keeping an eye on the knight in white armor as he turned towards her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The knight scoffed, the sound reverberating in his helm. He had a broadsword at his side, but he hadn’t drawn it, which was the only reason Byleth hadn’t run him through already. “What’s this supposed to be? Do you allow children into your guard, Lonato?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I won’t warn you again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Byleth, no!” Lonato suddenly said, holding a hand up while keeping the other in front of his younger children, “This man is a Knight of Seiros, you cannot fight him!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned. “Like the saint?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are they teaching commoners these days that you don’t even recognize a sworn sword of the goddess?” the knight complained, his hand resting on his sword. His armor wasn’t the heaviest, but platemail was still thick enough that she’d have to aim for his joints if she wanted to do any real damage. “I’ll give </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> one chance, girl. Lay down your sword, and perhaps I shall not strike you down for raising it in the first place.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I have already given you my warning.” It wasn’t a fight she wanted, but if the knight insisted then she would not hesitate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tch. Fine then. Take her,” he said, nodding to–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth whirled, catching another knight’s blade before it could slice down on her, prompting a shout from Lonato and screams from his children. “YOU SWORE NO ONE WOULD BE HARMED!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I meant you should restrain her, Sergei,” complained the first knight, audibly irritated, before pausing as Byleth slammed a palm into the second knight’s chest and blasted him with a fireball at point blank range, sending him crashing into the wall behind him. “...Huh. You’re not just some brat then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth kicked the fallen knight solidly in the head, slamming him further into the wall, before turning to lock eyes with the knight holding Lord Lonato hostage. “...One more chance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. I thought your previous warning was my last?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You told him to restrain me, and you swore to Lord Lonato you wouldn’t hurt anyone. I don’t think you want to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do not. It is my duty to investigate Lord Lonato’s estate following the accusations of treason against his late son, Christophe Gaspard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Late?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The knight nodded. “He is deceased. Executed for his part in the Tragedy of Duscur.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stared at him, then looked at Lord Lonato, who had gone completely white. “...What…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The knight didn’t regard him, keeping his eyes fully on Byleth. “Lower your sword, girl. You have already harmed one knight of Seiros. Do not make things worse for yourself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth raised her free hand towards the fallen knight and a light glow settled over him. “Heal. There. Now no harm has been done.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hahahaha, ah…Alright. I am willing to accept that.” He placed his hand on the hilt of his sword, before drawing it with the faint sound of steel sliding free. Or maybe not steel. Maybe silver, from the gleam of the blade. “What is your name, girl?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Byleth Eisner. I am a mercenary employed by Lord Lonato.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eisner? …No, never mind. I am Gael, a knight in service of the goddess. My name is one She has given to me. Out of respect for your loyalty to your employer, I ask we adjourn to the field outside. I would prefer not to cause undue harm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay. How many more knights are in the manor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“More than you can hope to face, girl.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll see,” Byleth stated, straightening from her stance and looking towards Lonato, who seemed…lost, in a way she hadn’t seen before. His mouth was moving without forming words, his gaze completely unseeing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The knight regarded him for a moment, then sighed. “Outside it is then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right–” The barest flash caught the corner of her eye, letting Byleth turn, moving her sword before it was wrenched from her grip, torn free by the hooks of a strange sword right before a shield emblazoned with a griffin smashed into her hard enough to send her all the way down the hall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfamiliar pain blossomed across her face and chest, making it hard to focus, though her vision cleared in time to see the same sword from before, pale and strangely cracked with six hooks jutting from the sides of its blade, pointing straight at her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A kid?” murmured the woman standing over her. Another knight in white armor, this one not wearing a helmet, showing a tanned face and long, blonde hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Damn it all, Catherine,” grumbled Gael as he moved out from Lonato’s lounge, “You didn’t need to do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Sir, she had a sword–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I had it handled. And now you’ve dishonored me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hmph.” The woman, Catherine, regarded Byleth with cold, blue eyes. “So what do we do with her? She raised–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–Sir! You can’t be serious! She raised a weapon against a Knight of Seiros! And did…whatever happened there to Sergei! You can’t tell me she had nothing to do with him!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I can. There was no harm done.” Gael glanced at the fallen knight and gave him a short kick to the leg. “Get up, you lazy bastard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gh, u-uh…w-wait, what–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I said get up.” Gael turned back to Catherine, his expression hidden but clearly disapproving, as further evidenced by him raising a hand and returning Byleth’s earlier favor, mending the pain she felt as she blinked in some surprise. “As I said, sheathe your sword. We’re done here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cassandra…? Why are you here?” Catherine went rigid, her eyes immediately darting towards Lord Lonato as he stepped out from the lounge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I…I-I, ah…L-Lord Lonato, I need to…speak with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You did it.” Lonato’s expression couldn’t quite be called surprised. There was recognition in it, realization, a dawning horror, and building anger all at once. “You killed my son.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Catherine swallowed. “...I-I wanted to t–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You killed my son. You </span>
  <em>
    <span>murdered</span>
  </em>
  <span> my </span>
  <em>
    <span>son!</span>
  </em>
  <span> YOU KILLED MY BOY!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth tried to push herself up. Something about the distress in the lord’s voice, the pain and hate in his eyes, made her want to move, to do something–And in a second, the sword was in her face again, Catherine’s eyes returning towards hers in a flash of something impossible to discern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a moment, it looked like she was going to run Byleth through when Gael’s hand caught her wrist. “I told you, you shouldn’t have been here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But–Y-You don’t understand, sir, I was going to–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Murderers…Murderers, every last one of you!” Lonato snapped, his face red with rage and his eyes narrowed with hate, “GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY HOME! GET OUT OR I WILL KILL ALL OF YOU!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You heard him. We are no longer welcome here,” Gael stated, before turning to regard Byleth one more time. “...Hm. Come on, both of you. We won’t find anything here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth managed to sit up by the time the knights had left. Lonato had collapsed, his face in his hands as heavy sobs wracked his once powerful body. None of that anger was there, only pure grief and despair as the kind noble Byleth knew wailed in open sorrow. There was no noble lord here, only an old man crushed by the reality of outliving his own son.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And as she watched, a strange feeling took hold in Byleth’s chest. Something…she didn’t know how to describe. A raw feeling her muted emotions were unused to. There was nothing she could do here, no word of comfort she could offer with her limited experience, and no enemy she could fight. Because the enemy had already left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For the first time…Byleth understood her sister’s desire to surpass her. Though, she didn’t think it was the same thing. Because Shez just wanted to beat her, not really hurt her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth wanted to </span>
  <em>
    <span>kill</span>
  </em>
  <span> Catherine.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>It’d been a long time since Jeralt felt as terrified as he did now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Gaspard was in chaos when he returned with his band. The word on everyone’s lips was “execution” as news spread of how Lord Lonato’s son had died, though that didn’t terrify him. No, what scared him down to his very core were the words “Knights of Seiros”, and, more than that, the knowledge that one of them hurt his kid. That Byleth had fought against them, and the only thing that kept her from being as dead as Christophe was their leader having some sense of restraint.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even then, he wanted to do just like Shez was doing and simply take Byleth in his arms and hold her close so nothing could hurt her again. But he couldn’t, because he had responsibilities, and so he left his youngest daughter clinging to his eldest like a limpet to a rock and tried to figure out just what the hell happened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The story made no sense. The idea that Christophe was involved in the King’s death just felt too impossible. Why would he? What could the young heir of a tiny lordship possibly gain from royal assassination?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He could think of a few things, but none of them fit properly. Lonato’s liege lord, Rowe, had a reputation, but then why wasn’t he investigated too? An entire nation was getting butchered in blame for the king’s death, but then some random lordling was also swept up in it? How? Why? And why would the church be involved then?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Too many questions raced through Jeralt’s head as he spent his days trying to keep things steady. A part of him wanted to leave the area completely, in case the knights came back, but paranoia of running into them on the road combined with the head of Lonato’s guard offering him a hefty pay to help keep the peace kept him in Gaspard. Even then, when he saw Byleth with an uncharacteristic scowl on her face as she hacked at a training dummy, he really did consider just bolting with her and Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I failed,” was her answer when he asked her what was wrong. “I was supposed to protect Lord Lonato but that knight beat me. She would have killed me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Kid…sometimes, we run into people we can’t beat–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know that. You’ve told me. There’s no shame in retreating. She blindsided me. I know we can cheat. I know we should cheat. I was listening to her leader and she attacked me. She attacked me during negotiations and you can never do that because it breaks trust and means everyone will always look at you as an oathbreaker and she did exactly that and I couldn’t stop her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Are you angry?” It seemed impossible, but for the first time, he saw a genuine glare on his daughter’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He was crying. Lord Lonato was crying and she killed his son and she came here just to tell him that. She came here to hurt him and I didn’t stop her from hurting him. Who are the Knights of Seiros?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kid…why are you asking that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want to know. Who are the Knights of Seiros?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I think you need to calm down–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tell me.” Her voice was sharp as she turned towards him. Her grip on her hilt was tight enough to make the blade shake. “Who are the Knights of Seiros? What are they? Why did they do this? What gives them the right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The right? That…Kid–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just tell me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He stared at his quiet, unemotive daughter as she snapped at him, her eyes set in a furious glare and her mouth set in an enraged scowl. There was no mistaking her expression for anything but angry, and he never expected to see it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Carefully, he reached for her hand and uncurled her fingers from her sword’s hilt. Her fist was clenched tight and his hands weren’t especially dextrous, but he gradually worked the sword from her grip before he pulled his daughter into a hug. She didn’t pull back, but she didn’t lean in either. She was rigid until she started to shake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was hard to think she was sixteen already. She was growing more and more, day by day, and he should have expected things would change. He knew she was getting more expressive, but he never thought she would feel things this strongly. That she could genuinely get upset at something like this. But then, injustice had a funny way of bringing out emotion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a while before Lord Lonato called on Jeralt again. The already old noble looked worn as he stared out the window in his office, his hands clasped behind his back. Some people would call his appearance dignified, but to Jeralt, he looked like a castle held up by a single support. One that was already cracked straight through the middle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I am sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of all the ways Jeralt expected this conversation to start, that wasn’t one of them. “For what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your daughter was hurt protecting me. I told her not to fight, and they tried to kill her anyway. I am sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Thanks. It’s…It’s rough, but I have a feeling you’re going through worse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Lonato sighed, slowly, still not looking at Jeralt. “My son is dead. The Central Church executed him on charges of treason, blaming him for the Tragedy of Duscur. My son is dead and the truth has been hidden for what I can only assume is convenience. You do not believe my son committed the charges they accused him of.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t, no.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I am glad. It was my first reaction, yet…It is difficult to doubt people. I think we all expect others to be honest. It is a foolish expectation, but one we all hold, as long as there is some trust in our hearts. Though, perhaps ‘expect’ is not the correct word. Maybe it is ‘hope’...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Is there a reason you wanted to speak with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are a mercenary, Jeralt. You are not a knight. You are not beholden to any man except yourself. You will do your job admirably well, but it is merely a job at the end of the day. I was wondering if I may hire you for a job.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Jeralt had a bad feeling. “I can’t promise anything, but I can hear you out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you. I expected no less.” Finally, Lonato turned, looking at Jeralt. And it was impossible to mistake the look of restrained rage in his eyes. For some people, anger surged up like a fire, eating up everything and burning out once its fuel was gone. For others though, anger was like a pot of water set atop of an open flame. It simmered, it boiled, but it stayed in the pot unless something finally tipped it out. Lonato was that second type of person. “I want you to kill a woman named Catherine. She was once known as Cassandra Rubens Charon. She is now a Knight of Seiros. Is this something you can do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I can’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see. She is the woman who almost killed your daughter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt felt himself tense on reflex, but he let out a sigh, calming down. “I had a feeling. I still can’t. I need to take care of my kids. I can’t do that if I go up against the Knights of Seiros.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can pay you whatever you want. I’m not as wealthy as other lords, I know that, but I can give you as much as I can. Please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Lonato, I can’t. Please, understand. You still have three kids to take care of. Would you put them in danger?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a moment where the anger in Lonato’s eyes seemed to flicker. A cool wind keeping the pot from boiling over. “...Very well. I expect you will want to leave soon. I am sorry to have kept you here for so long. Thank you very much for your service.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He bowed his head, and Jeralt felt a flash of guilt that he tried to smother. “...” He wasn’t successful. “I could have my people look into things. Maybe we could find out the truth behind Christophe’s death. If that would help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Lonato just shook his head. “No. No, you are right. I would not wish what I am feeling now on anyone I consider a friend. You have children to take care of, and so do I. Thank you for all your efforts. I hope your coming days are brighter than…I hope you take care.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks. You take care too, alright?” And Jeralt left with a pit in his stomach. He wasn’t a hero, he could admit that much, but it felt wrong to leave things as they were.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then again, he was a mercenary. </span>
  <span>And no merc would stick around somewhere there was too much risk and no real reward.</span>

  <p>
  <span>It was weird seeing Byleth actually be angry. Shez had gotten used to her adoptive older sister being very…well, she wasn’t really apathetic, exactly. That wasn’t the right word for it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t that Byleth was an uncaring person, it’s just that she cared less than other people. Which still sounded bad, but it wasn’t! It was just how she was. Things that might make someone else mad didn’t bother her, and something that would make someone really angry would, at most, slightly annoy her. And it wasn’t like she didn’t react to things either, she would definitely react if someone, such as Shez, did stuff like poke her while she was trying to sleep and tried to steal food from her plate. It’s just that she didn’t react </span>
  <em>
    <span>strongly</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So it was really, really weird seeing her so agitated ever since they left Gaspard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I wouldn’t get worked up about it,” said Candace when Shez brought up the subject while on kitchen duty, “She’s at that age where she’s bound to get moody. I remember being a real bitch when I was sixteen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not it, moron,” Victor chided, frowning at the dirty-blonde lancer from where he was dicing the meat for the night’s stew, “Weren’t you paying attention at all while we were back in Gaspard territory? She was friends with that lord’s son and then he went and got executed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, was that it? Huh. Hey, you think she had a crush on him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Are you seriously asking that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, it would make sense. She’s also at the age to start noticing boys, so I wouldn’t be surprised.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t think Byleth likes boys,” Shez pointed out, glancing at the slightly taller woman who was stirring the pot while Shez peeled the vegetables. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She doesn’t? Huh…Yeah, I could see that, that makes sense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can you hold a consistent opinion for one minute?” Victor griped, and Shez came to the conclusion she really shouldn’t ask the other mercenaries for advice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Perhaps you would care to listen to my advice then?" Arval asked as Shez continued to peel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Letting out a sigh, Shez nodded, not wanting the others to hear her talk with Arval. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good, now, while I feel odd advising you about your rival in this manner, but if, as you say, your sister does not react strongly to things, then should it not be obvious how badly this is affecting her from how she is reacting to it?" Arval asked as they floated by her. "As such, you have one of two options: you may either ignore this all entirely and let her deal with her emotions, or you can go talk with her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...about what?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You are her sister, are you not? I'm sure you can think of something to talk with her about," Arval said as they disappeared, which wasn’t helpful in the slightest. Clenching her teeth, Shez continued to peel the vegetables as quickly as she could so she could talk with Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Minutes later, Shez was out of the kitchen tent, searching for Byleth. Who was easy to find as she spotted her on the training grounds, her sword smacking a training dummy hard enough to break it. Frustrated, Byleth kicked the broken dummy to the side as she began to set up another one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, By,” Shez spoke up, making her sister glance over at her. "I see training is going well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm." Byleth responded, making sure the second dummy was stable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, uh, I wanted to talk, if you have the time?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Make it quick." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"By…I don't really know what to say, but I'm really worried! You haven't been acting like yourself, and I don't like how bad you're feeling!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that all?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wh–Hey, come on By, I'm trying to talk with you!" Shez said, feeling indignant at getting brushed aside like that. "You can't just ignore me cause you're feeling bad!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm in the middle of training, you should go back to help with kitchen duty." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Seriously!?" Shez stared in disbelief as Byleth turned away from her so she could strike at the training dummy. "Don't ignore me!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The loud thwack of a sword hitting the training dummy was the only response she got. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Gritting her teeth, Shez felt a swell of anger in her as her sister paid her no attention. As such, she did the only thing she could think of. Bringing her fist up, Shez punched Byleth across the cheek, knocking her to the ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked, genuine surprise crossing her face as she looked up at her sister. "Sh-Shez-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I win!" Shez shouted before Byleth could finish speaking. "So that means I'm the older sister now! That means you have to listen to me!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That wasn't a fi-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And as the older sister, I'm telling you, you aren't allowed to leave me behind anymore!" Shez shouted, feeling tears well up. "You can't go off on your own if you think something dangerous is happening! We're stronger together!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stared at her, her usually dull eyes wide with disbelief and confusion, before she pushed herself up. Shez clenched and unclenched her fists, hating the tears that threatened to spill from her eyes, but she kept her gaze steady on her sister as Byleth continued to stare at her, her cheek red where Shez punched her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You can’t run off like that,” Shez insisted, “You almost…I wasn’t even there. I-I had to hear from Gertrude that you almost died. You can’t do that to me! You’re my sister, you’re not allowed to die!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“S-Say something! Please, talk to me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You almost died before,” Byleth muttered with an unexpected heat in her voice. She couldn’t seem to let go of her sword, her grip shifting as a strange tension filled her body. “You were stabbed. I wasn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Th-That’s different though! I have powers you don’t!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is different. You killed the soldier that hurt you. I couldn’t do anything.” Her grip tightened on her sword. “I don’t understand why I feel like this. I never have before. I don’t understand it, everything feels tight and tense and there’s this </span>
  <em>
    <span>pressure</span>
  </em>
  <span> I can’t do anything about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re angry,” Shez realized. It wasn’t quite a revelation, or at least it shouldn’t be, but a part of her still thought her sister just couldn’t get mad the way other people did. “By, that’s natural. Remember the expression things I made years ago? Everybody gets angry!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well obviously you do! What else would you call this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, I haven’t felt it before. I didn’t feel it when that noble harassed us, I didn’t feel it when you almost died, I’ve never felt it, so why am I feeling it now? I barely know Lonato, he was just a client, so why am I angry? You’re not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, yeah, but I’m different from you. I don’t know why I’m not more mad, I just don’t get that angry when people die.” She shrugged. “I guess I’m too used to it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So why do you care that I almost died?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez went rigid, feeling like her sister just punched her in turn. A flicker of concern crossed Byleth’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How can you ask that? Y-You…You should know! Of course I’m more upset–It’s just different! You’re my family! Of course I care! You cared when you thought I died, right?” She hated how weak her voice got there, naturally shrinking back at what she was almost positive the answer would be–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Yes, I did, I cared, I was…” Byleth’s breath shook, and Shez was shocked to see tears starting to prick at her eyes. “...I don’t understand. I don’t know what I’m feeling. I don’t know why it hurts…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez hugged her sister. She just…It felt like the only thing she could do.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth was being hugged again. Something deep in her chest hurt like it never had before. She dropped her sword and wrapped her arms around her sister, startled by the sudden sob she let out. Though…she wasn’t completely sure which of them started crying. Just that she couldn’t bear to let go.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Some time later, Jeralt was face to face with his two daughters, both of whom were red in the eyes and their hands in an iron grip of one another. He had heard what had happened, the two girls didn't really make an attempt to be secretive earlier, so word got back to him quickly. Even so, he still took the time to prepare himself as he got ready for what was to come. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are the Knights of Seiros?" Shez asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt sighed. It was a long, deep sigh, carrying far too much weight with it. He looked at his kids, both unwavering as they stared at him, before he nodded, accepting this wasn’t a conversation he could put off any longer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Knights of Seiros are the military arm of the Central Church. They’re a knightly order dedicated to upholding the will of the Goddess as the Church defines it. If the church needs something handled with violence, the knights are who they call on for it. And I used to be one of them.” He didn’t like the look Byleth gave him there. It was strangely startled and affronted. Not quite betrayed, but…He still didn’t like it. “Specifically, I used to be their captain. The leader of the knights as a whole.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth’s grip tightened around Shez’s hand. Shez looked at her, then back at her dad. “...Maybe we should sit down?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that might be a good idea.” He didn’t have too much room in his tent, but he could at least pull over a chair while his kids sat on his bed. It gave him a moment to collect his thoughts. “...I was born in Faerghus a long time ago. I was a mercenary. Not really anyone special, but I did get lucky in a sense. I was hired to help guard the Archbishop Rhea, the leader of the church, on a trip through the kingdom, and I nearly died protecting her. She healed me, and I joined the Knights of Seiros.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was pretty good at it, I’m not going to lie. I became captain for a reason and things were fine. I followed my orders and protected the Archbishop. And then…I met your mother.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked towards Byleth, who just stared back at him, then glanced at Shez, who looked a little uncomfortable at hearing something so personal, but kept close to her sister anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I won’t go into all the details, but I fell in love with her,” he continued, “I loved her more than anyone I ever met before. I loved her more than the sky loves the stars. I loved her enough to have a kid with her. And I was so happy to think I would have a family with her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And then she died. Rhea was the one that helped deliver you, Byleth, and she said Sitri died in childbirth…but something about it…She wouldn’t let me see Sitri’s body. And the way she held you…it felt like she wanted to take you away. The way she acted, the way everything looked…It broke whatever trust I had in her. So I left. I set a fire at the monastery and I abandoned everything I knew there because I couldn’t trust it any longer. I needed to keep you safe, and the monastery stopped feeling safe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sighed. “...I still don’t know if that was the right choice. I–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt paused, then looked at Byleth. He didn’t expect her to interrupt him, but the look in her eyes was steely and certain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you didn’t leave, we wouldn’t have met Shez. So you made the right choice." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Y-Yeah! And you wouldn't have met everyone else either!" Shez exclaimed as well. "It's been…rough, but I'm really glad I joined you guys. If those knights are gonna be a problem, then that just means I have to get stronger so they can't hurt you two!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll make sure they can't hurt you two as well," Byleth said with quiet determination. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Letting out a sigh, he leaned back in his chair. "I will say, I never would have thought taking you in would have led to something like this, Shez, but I'm glad I did." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I am too!" Shez declared, earning an agreeing nod from Byleth. "And now that we know this stuff, we can make sure to avoid the knights and the monastery!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Is this why you didn't want us to join the academy?" Byleth asked, looking thoughtful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt nodded. "Yeah, the academy is at the monastery, so no way I was taking a chance with the two of you going there."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, well, not like we were ever going there anyways,” Shez dismissed, “And I doubt you'd ever take a job there." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Trust me kid, I don't plan on it. Now come on, we should get something to eat before only the vegetables are left in the stew," Jeralt said, getting up to get his daughters to do the same. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well as the older sister, I clearly deserve first dibs!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...right, you two really need to explain that thing of yours to me." Jeralt muttered as the trio went out, a family affirmed once again. </span>

  <span>“Captain, it’s time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt paused, then glanced up from his ledgers at his mercenary band’s longest lasting healer. Getrude looked oddly serious, which was…concerning. “Right…that time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Alright, what time could she mean? Time to move on? They’d only just gotten back into the Alliance after another trip into the Empire, so it probably wasn’t that…they didn’t have any jobs lined up either, which was why he was sitting in an inn instead of out in a tent. It was summer, so it wasn’t Byleth or Shez’s birthday…It wasn’t his anniversary either, and he was pretty sure Getrude didn’t even know when that was, nor would she care. She and Ezra had a thing going, but she didn’t look pregnant… “Yeah, I have no idea what you mean.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I figured, but I wanted to see if you would guess right.” He sighed at her blunt response, prompting a slight grin from her. “It’s time your daughters got new clothes again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Again? Wait, really? What’s wrong with their old clothes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aside from the fact that Byleth tore through the shirt she was putting on this morning?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He blinked. “That happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It did. I’m surprised you didn’t hear Shez mocking her for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well that did explain the laughter he heard earlier… “Are you sure we need to buy new ones though? We should have more clothes in storage.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Captain, you can’t just keep giving your daughters hand-me-downs. Byleth is eighteen and Shez is…whatever age she is. They’re growing girls with their own body types and you can’t just toss tunics at them and hope they’ll fit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Are you sure? We should have something–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jeralt, your daughter ripped through a shirt because her boobs are too big. I’m buying her clothes today. Now fork over some coin for it or I’ll use the medical funds.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Jeralt sighed. “Fine, alright. Buy whatever they need. I was checking the ledgers today anyway so I’ll just make a note of whatever you spend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good.” With that, she walked off, and Jeralt returned to his accounting. Hopefully they wouldn’t rack up too big an expense.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Do we really need new clothes?” Byleth asked as she followed Getrude and Candace through town. Shez was along with her, of course, wearing an admittedly ill-fitting orange tunic. “My coat is still fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can’t walk around in just a coat, Byleth,” Gertrude chided, “There’s a word for that and you don’t want it associated with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sides, is it really such a bad thing?” Candace asked, glancing back at the two girls, “It’s a girls’ day out! Youngsters like you oughta be happy to have fun like this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s fun about clothes shopping?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lots of stuff! You try things on, see how they look, pick it if it’s comfy and not too pricey, that sort of thing!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t really get how that’s fun?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll know it when you try it! First things though, we gotta find a clothes place…Hey, Gert, which one’s the fancy type?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It depends. Some tailors are fancy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, tailors are the type that mend clothes. I think. It’s, uh….no, I know this one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A boutique?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! One of those! They usually got good clothes for ladies. Granted, none of us are ladies in the noble sense, but we’re still women so it should work. I think.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth and Shez shared a look while Getrude tapped her chin in thought. “Well, if you spot a boutique, we could give it a try. We’re in Leicester right now, so they’re slightly less likely to throw us out for not being well-dressed enough.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, how’s that work?” Shez asked, “I thought the point of a clothes shop was to buy clothes, why would you have to dress up for it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ask the nobility, Shez. The bourgeois make the rules, we just have to follow them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s society. But let’s leave the heavy topics for later. For now, that looks like a nice place.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And so the Eisner sisters were introduced to the enjoyable and/or frustrating activity that was shopping for clothes. Now, it wasn’t as though the concept completely eluded the two sisters, it’s just that their circumstances hadn’t really required buying clothes for specifically personal use before this point. More often, the two would, as part of their chores, put in an order for a bulk amount of clothes and armor when needed, and then just take whatever worked best for them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth tended to prefer black and gray clothes while Shez liked brown and orange, with the occasional splash of red in the mix, so they really didn’t have to worry much when it came to clothes they would like. Which also meant they hadn’t really experimented with styles before this point, and, well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While it didn’t take long for Shez to pick out some simple dresses and tunics that she liked, ones that would be easy enough to armor up later and could be worn easily enough with what shorts and pants she also picked out, Byleth decided to experiment a bit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, By? Did you rip through another shirt?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I didn’t. This one is just like this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez raised an eyebrow. “It’s supposed to show off your chest and belly like that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I like it. The pink lining is nice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Well I guess if you like it,” Shez said with a shrug, before idly considering if she should add something to spice up her own outfit. She liked what she picked out, but maybe it could be more colorful?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While Shez went off to explore her options, Byleth returned to her own exploration, starting with some leggings that looked interesting. And some heeled boots that looked interesting. And a detached shirt collar that looked interesting. And huh, those shorts looked cute. Oh, and so did that pendant with the tassel! Hm, maybe she should add more tassels to her clothes?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>By the time Gertrude and Candance found Byleth again, they found her in a rather…interesting outfit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth, what are you wearing?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My new outfit, what do you think?" Byleth asked, seeming excited about what she chose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It looks great!" Candace said, grinning giving the younger merc a thumbs up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you." Byleth seemed quite happy that her fashion sense was appreciated, while Gertrude muttered to herself that at least it fit her. Thankfully they didn't have to wait long for Shez to come back, who was definitely more modestly dressed, even if the colors were a bit garish. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, look what I found!" Shez said, gesturing to an over the shoulder cape, before moving it around her head. "Works as a cape and a scarf!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Handy," Byleth noted, while Gertrude wondered where these two got their sense of fashion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, is that all?" the medic asked, already doing some mental math about how much this would all cost. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I think I'm good," Shez responded as Byleth nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Great, then let's go pay!" Candance said, immediately getting the attention of a redheaded worker. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I can help you right here with that!" Anna said, all grins as she was ready to get paid. "Now all together that should be two thousand gold~!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh? What are you talking about? This can't be worth more than twelve hundred," Candace immediately responded with a frown. "They weren't even proper outfits, it's different pieces they grabbed." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Anna's smile got very strained there. "Be that as it may, these are all made out of the highest quality material around, and I can guarantee you they're worth the price." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Worth market price, sure, but how much did you mark it up?" Candace asked, before glancing around the store. "I'm seeing plenty of things around here that seem to be twice the price than the usual." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I sincerely hope you aren't trying to accuse me of scamming my customers." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course not, just saying you want to make a profit, and I'm sure you made more than enough to let some things slide," Candance said, before smirking. "Though if you aren't makin’ that much, well, I can understand being in need of money. Why I'm sure I can spread the word around of you raising your prices cause you need the money." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Yeah the smile looked almost murderous now. "...Ah, my apologies, it seems those items were meant to go on sale. It seems you are right, they were meant to just be twelve hundred!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, glad we can do business then!" Candace said, smiling again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks, Candace, you really know how to help a gal save some money," Gertrude praised as she paid. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Kinda feel like Candance would be scary as a merchant," Shez muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I was!" the blonde admitted, much to their surprise. "Yeah, it didn't go so well, cause people kept thinking I was trying to strongarm them into buying stuff." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Huh." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm. I’m glad you joined up," Byleth said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, I'm glad I did as well!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, well come on now, sweet as this is, we shouldn't keep your dad waiting," Gertrude said, getting the kids to move along as they went back to camp. Mainly because she wanted to see how Jeralt would react to these outfits. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a good decision all around, really, because seeing him nearly choke on his tea was hilarious. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Hey Shez, do you mind helping me cut my hair?" Byleth asked her sister one day upon noticing how long her hair had gotten, already going down her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Oh sure!" Shez responded with a smile, tossing the book she was reading onto her bedroll. "You know, you don't need to cut it all the time. Look at me, my hair is super long and I don't have any problems with it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I just don't like having long hair," Byleth said as she handed her dagger to Shez. "Gets in the way." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Fine, fine." Shez said, taking the dagger as she got to work on her sister's hair once they sat down. "Same as usual?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah." Byleth responded, feeling her sister grab her hair and begin to cut it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, just goes to show how much better you are since you don't have to worry about your hair mid combat." Arval commented. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C’mon, Arval, would you cut it out for once?” Shez requested, speaking freely with her partner since it was just her and Byleth, who didn’t mind if her sister talked to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh fine, if you insist. I will ‘cut it out’ just like you just cut out a bigger chunk of hair than you intended.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” Shez glanced at her partner, then looked at the clump of hair in her hand. Then she looked at Byleth’s hair and noticed it did look distinctly uneven. “Oh, that’s an easy fix.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s an ‘easy fix’?” Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, just cut a little more than I meant to. It’s fine, you wanted your hair short anyway, right? Here, I’ll just even it out,” Shez said, moving to grab hair from the other side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just be careful, okay?" Byleth asked as Shez tried to cut the same amount from the other side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh…do you care about how short it is?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'd prefer it around my shoulders."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Ah." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez, if it's too much I can handle it-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No no, it's all good!" Shez responded, even as she realized she got it wrong. Well, that’s fine, she could just cut from the other side…And then she frowned she noticed she actually cut too much there. So she tried to get it from the opposite side, and…Hm. “Huh…ah, okay, I think it’s…more even now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Shez, I’m feeling…something. And I’m not sure what it is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh…that’s probably joy! At how great your haircut is!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you trying to make her look like your father?” Arval queried, floating above the two of them with a pensive look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? No, she doesn’t look like dad…does she?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Shez. Why would I look like dad?” Byleth asked, definitely feeling new emotions now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…you don’t! You look great! I just need to take some from the back…probably.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Reaching up, Byleth tried to feel her hair, only to touch the sides of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Maybe if I just-" Before she could try anything, Shez felt Byleth grab her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let go of the knife, and please leave the tent for now." Feeling very sheepish, Shez did, muttering out a sorry as she left the tent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So it seems professional barbering is not in your future," Arval said, quite amused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That only happened cause you distracted me!" Shez hissed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What distracted you?" Jeralt asked, walking up to Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh, nothing dad!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, well, is Byleth okay? Wanted to check up on you two before we broke camp." Jeralt explained, before he heard the tent flap open. "Oh, Byleth-...why are you wearing a helmet?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Looking behind her, Shez winced as she saw Byleth wearing a leather helmet, normally reserved for sparring. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Felt like it," Byleth said, before walking past the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, is she in a bad mood or something?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah well, you know, probably just woke up on the bad side of the bedroll!" Shez tried to hurriedly explain. Looking at her sister, Shez couldn't help but wince once again at what she had done. She could probably make it up to her later, right? Right.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you could even it out further by shaving her bald–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up, Arval!”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Alright girls, gather around,” Victor requested, gesturing for the Eisner sisters to take a seat at the same table as him, “Your old uncle Victor is going to be teaching you one of the most important lessons a merc can learn in this line of work: how to gamble.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth exchanged a look with Shez, before they both said what they were thinking: “How is gambling important to being a mercenary?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re dad’s brother?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused, then sighed at Shez’s confused response while Victor laughed. “Nope, there’s no relation between us. I was trying for a term of endearment thing–Ah, never mind, it doesn’t matter. The real important part is making sure you two kids know what you’re doing when you inevitably run into someone looking to take advantage of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stab them twice in the gut,” Byleth answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s illegal,” Victor promptly responded, then paused, “Unless they’re an outlaw. Then, legally speaking, you can kill them however you want. Just don’t torture them because that’s a great way to get branded an outlaw instead because the nobles think you’re creepy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you ever torture anyone?” Shez asked, genuinely curious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, I’m not the type. Too squeamish,” answered the man the two girls had seen crush a bandit’s head with a warhammer just two days ago. “I did know a guy who did though and yeah, he was regarded as a real freak. Hm, that was a while back, thinking about it. I wonder what Metodey is up to these days…ah, never mind. My point is, there’s gonna be folks who will offer gambles and you might be pressured to join in. Or, hell, you might even think it’s fun to join in. If you refuse outright, it should be fine, but on the off chance you do decide to gamble, think back to this lesson so you know what to do. That being to cheat, enormously and without reservation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Got it,” Byleth said, nodding to show her understanding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, just looked confused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"First and foremost is making sure you know how to catch a cheat," Victor said, pulling out a deck of cards. "There's plenty of ways to cheat, and plenty of ways to slip up." He set the cards between them. "Here, cut the deck for me–not with a knife. Just grab the deck and separate it in two." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sheathing her dagger, Byleth grabbed the deck, grabbing about half or so and setting it down next to the first deck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now then, let's start simple: guess which card I'm about to draw, and the closest guess to what card it is wins. Here, I'll start my guess: it'll be a three of clubs." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…eight of hearts." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll go with a king then! Of clubs!" Grinning, Victor flipped the card over, showing a three of clubs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And if we were betting money, you would have gotten cheated out of it. Second lesson, always make sure to shuffle the deck yourself, and third–" He flicked a card out of his sleeve. "Make sure it isn't tampered with beforehand." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Wait, how’s that tampering with the deck?” Shez asked, “That card wasn’t in the deck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes it was.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...h…huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor chuckled, before going through what his sleight of hand step by step, showing where he’d stacked the card so it stuck out of the deck just enough for him to position it without them noticing and when he’d slipped the card up his sleeve to make sure the card he wanted was on top. “See? Now, that’s not the only way to tamper with a deck. You can do it in subtle ways like I did, or you can mark the cards ahead of time, if you’re using your own deck. There are ways to subtly mark them too, if you bend the cards in certain ways, but of course most of these tricks work better if you have a pal at the table helping you out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…huh.” Shez nodded, still looking a little lost while Byleth was quietly absorbing all the new information. “So…me and Byleth would do better if we were helping each other?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly. Though you might want to let Byleth be the one helping you, Shez. You’re looking kinda lost.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Hey, I can do it! I just need to practice!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, but there’s nothing wrong with not getting it. Like I said, it usually works better if there’s two of you cheating together. Like Byleth playing as the dealer and making sure you get the best cards at the table.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need help though,” Shez insisted, frowning, which prompted a chuckle from Victor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, let me make something clear, alright? It’s okay if you’re not the best at everything. You can try to be, if you want, but you’re gonna have spots you aren’t as good in. You don’t see me trying to ride a horse like Candace or heal people like Gertrude, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Or stab people like Ezra,” Byleth suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I can do everything better than that stringbean. Aside from maybe lockpicking, I’m willing to give him that one, even if I could do the exact same thing with a big enough rock…my point is, there’s no such thing as being intelligent. You’re always gonna be smart in some ways and dumb in others. You won’t have the brains to do everything, so let other people pick up the slack, alright? You already know you’re stronger working with your sister than against her, so just keep that in mind when it comes to other stuff too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…Hmph. I thought you were teaching us how to cheat, not trying to give life lessons,” Shez complained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Learning how to cheat is a life lesson, squirt. And hey, while I have you here, how about I impart another one? In this case, a lesson about cultural differences.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, Victor shuffled the deck together again before placing it back on the table. Then he placed two more card decks on the table with an amused grin on his bearded face. “Alright, what’s the difference?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Uh…oh, uh, that deck’s red, that deck’s blue, and that deck is, uh...I guess that’s a kind of greenish color?” Shez offered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s olive green,” Byleth said, “It also has a shield on the back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was getting to that part!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, you’re right enough, sure. The covers all look different. Flip them over though, and what do you see?” Victor asked while flipping the first card of each deck, showing a line of Aces.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hey, wait, these two look weird,” Shez noted, pointing to the cards from the blue and green decks. “The symbols are all different.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right you are, Shez. This one, from the Imperial Standard deck–” He tapped the card that came from his original deck. “–is an Ace of Spades. But this one here, from the Kingdom Standard deck–” He tapped the card from the blue deck. “–is an Ace of Swords, while this one–” And lastly, he tapped the card from the green deck. “–is an Ace of Snow. Care to guess where it comes from?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Alliance,” Byleth answered, earning a grin from the burly merc.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly. You see, while most gambling houses you can name will use the Imperial Standard deck. It’s recognizable, everyone knows what’s up with it, there’s no worries. But some folks from the Kingdom, in all their infinite wisdom, decided an Imperial deck wouldn’t do for them, so they decided to change things up. Instead of the standard spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds, the Kingdom went for swords, cups, staves, and coins, and instead of Imperial Red, they went for Kingdom Blue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor spread the cards out as he explained, showing that each of them was marked differently, and where the hearts and diamonds were printed in red ink, the cups and coins were printed in blue. “Not the brightest idea, given it meant Faerghan printing houses had to commission an entire different set of woodblocks to make their versions of cards, but they did it anyway because Faerghans are nothing if not stubborn dastards. Which leads us right over to the Alliance cards, which do things completely differently.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once more he laid out the cards and Shez blinked at the sudden wash of color. “Oh wow, these are pretty.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ain’t they? See, these sets of cards went for something very different from the standard set, drawing off of old stories instead of recognizable implements and symbols. So for card suits, you have the snow, the flowers, the moons, and the gales,” he explained, gesturing in turn to the azure snowflakes, the crimson flowers, the golden moons, and the emerald spirals printed on each card, “Though I’ll add that these colors ain’t always consistent. The gales are always green and the flowers are always red, but sometimes you get decks with the snowflakes printed in silver and the moons colored a deep blue. Why the change up? Who knows. Way I heard it, it has to do with the seasons, though I personally think gold works for a better Autumn color than blue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Uh…huh. And…what’s all this supposed to mean?” Shez asked, “You’re trying to say something about the nations, right? And how everybody does things differently?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, there’s that, but I’m also saying you need to check which deck someone’s using before you try to cheat them.” Victor barked a laugh as Shez frowned at him. “Ha! Ah, more seriously, consider this an easy way of looking at the countries around here. Adrestia sets the standard, Faerghus goes out of their way to do the opposite while still copying them, and Leceister goes off and does its own thing that’s barely even consistent.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Yeah okay, that makes sense,” Shez said, nodding along, “…Hey, could you show me some more card tricks?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure I can! And after that, how bout I show you two how to cheat at dice?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heck yeah!” Shez cheered, a big grin on her face as Byleth idly studied the cards on the table. She understood what Victor was going for, but the metaphor seemed kind of silly to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even if there were differences in the symbols, they were all still playing cards at the end of the day. There wasn’t that much difference between them.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Riding on horseback in combat felt completely different than fighting on foot. You could have more speed, and each swing you made had more weight to it. However, it also had its difficulties… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Agh, come on!" Shez shouted as she missed a swing at a dummy, the horse she was on rushing straight passed it. "Why is this so weird?!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You do tend to go for rapid strikes with two swords. So going for a heavy swing with one sword is completely different," Byleth noted as Shez came back, jumping off Argo as she grumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Feh, don't see why I have to train for horseback." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's handy," Byleth said, holding out an apple for Argo, the horse eating it before nuzzling against her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Doesn't matter if it's handy if I can't hit anything." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It does matter to practice though. You never know when we might need to fight while riding.” She glanced over at their barrels of weapons. “Maybe you should try it with a lance? You might feel better with it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how you’re so good with everything you use,” Shez complained, pouting, “I swear, it’s like you have a natural instinct for any weapon someone puts in your hand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not true. I’m average with anything that’s not a sword.” She paused. “Or my fists, I guess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Being average with everything is still better than being bad at some things!” Shez huffed, then glanced at the lances. “Maybe I should just try one of those? But that’s learning a whole different thing…is there a way to fight with two swords on top of a horse?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably. That sounds like a bad idea though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I guess…It would be kind of cool to be a strong knight like dad though…hm.” The thought of her, Byleth, and their dad all dressed up as full knights on horseback crossed Shez’s mind, and she had to admit it wasn’t a bad image. Byleth could probably be one of those fancy knights with the light magic in the stories, and Shez could be her dark counterpart! All dark and edgy and…hm, wait, did she have the right temperament to be a dark knight? Byleth was the stoic one, so…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you thinking about?” Byleth asked, prompting a shrug from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just if I could be a scary dark knight. I’m not all stoic and stuff, so I think I have to go the other direction and act crazy instead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Don’t act crazy. People won’t hire you if they think you’re a murderous lunatic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s part of the style!” Shez complained, pouting, before studying her sister with a speculative eye. “...No, you couldn’t be a dark knight. You seem stoic, but you’re way too soft on the inside.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m soft?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, you know, you’re sweet. You don’t even like killing bugs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned. “They’re not bothering anyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“See? Way too soft. You need your big, strong older sister to protect you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Since when were you older?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Since last time, don’t think about it.” Shez grinned, before a thought occurred. “Actually, here!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked as Shez suddenly handed her something. She raised an eyebrow as she looked at the small whistle in her hand. “...What is this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A merc whistle! You know, like the one dad gave us when we were on lookout all the way in Sauin.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The one you took off with by accident?” She paused. “Is this that same whistle?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ehhh, might be. Either way! I figure you should have it! That way, if anything ever happens to you, you can blow it and I’ll come running!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth lightly punched Shez’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey! Rude! Here I am, offering to protect you, and you hit me!” She pouted, though she grinned about a second later. “You like it, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah. I don’t have anything for you though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I don’t need anything. As the older sister, I’m the one that protects you, you know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. As the actual older sister, I’ll make sure to return the favor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As the actual actual older sister, I can tell you right now that you don’t need to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes I do.” She paused. “Actually, I know what you could use. A tactics primer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Hey! I don’t need one of those! I’m doing just fine with what I’ve got!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I’ll make sure to write one up for you. That way you can learn everything you need from your much more experienced older sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez narrowed her eyes. “...Get a horse. We’re going to joust for this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, sure. Don’t be upset when you lose.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just for that, I’m not holding back!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To very little surprise, Shez lost anyway. Turns out “not holding back” didn’t matter much when she really didn’t have the skills in that area to begin with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t over yet!” Shez declared, shaking out her hand after her lance had splintered against Byleth’s shield, “Best two out of three!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m ready when you are,” Byleth said with an amused smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez didn’t fare any better on the second pass. Really, she fared worse, and that led to a very annoyed Ezra confiscating their laces and declaring that neither of them were allowed to joust without supervision again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You weren’t even doing it right,” he groused, tossing Shez a vulnerary to help with the bruises she got from hitting the ground, “You’re supposed to aim for the shields, not each other’s heads.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you still win if you knock the other person out though?” Shez asked before downing the healing brew.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure you do, and then you get me coming around to smack you upside the head for knocking your sister out. Really, you would’ve won the first round since you broke your lance properly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, really? Oh! That means we’re tied! So we can–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But Ezra–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Answer’s still no. Especially since these ain’t tourney lances, they’re for training, and breaking them is a waste. Which is why your new competition is to see who can fix the lance they broke better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re just upset because I would be an awesome dark knight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...what the genuine hell does that mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Shez launched into an explanation of her beliefs regarding the dark knight aesthetic, Byleth simply got to work on repairing the lances that could be fixed. If they turned useless, they could always burn the remains as firewood; otherwise, Byleth was going to give it her best spot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wanted to win their competition, after all.</span>

  <p>
  <span>A simple stone throne upon which a young girl slept was what greeted Byleth in the void. Blinking in surprise, she looked around, finding nothing but darkness stretching out around her, the only light there illuminating the still sleeping girl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At least, she was asleep until Byleth heard her yawn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Oh my, it seems I am not alone." The green-haired girl said as she noticed Byleth. "Though I must say, it is quite rude to interrupt someone's moment of rest. If you're going to do so, at least step closer so I know who you are." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cautious, Byleth did as she requested, ready for whatever she did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, I've never seen you before. Who are you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'm Byleth, a mercenary." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so? You are rather young for a mercenary are you not?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm twenty years old." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Naught but a child,” she said, as if Byleth was agreeing with her. "Ah, but I suppose that matters not, I shall be returning to my rest that you so rudely interrupted." Yawning, the young girl closed her eyes so she could go to sleep, the light in the area fading away.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Hey, By, get up!" Eyes snapping open, Byleth was awoken by the sound of Shez shouting at her. Sitting up, she saw her sister’s grin as she peeked her head into where she was sleeping. "Heh, come on now sleepyhead, get up! Or does my little sister need some more sleep?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...you didn't win the last match." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, but a tie means we keep going with the last winner!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Since when?" Byleth asks as she gets up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Since I decided!" Shez declared with a laugh. "Now come on, dad wants to make sure you're ready for the long march we got ahead of us." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I made sure to prepare before I went to sleep," Byleth responded before pausing. "...hey Shez, how did you meet Arval again?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? Well, it was a dream. Least, I thought it was till I saw them when I woke up. Why do you ask?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There was a little girl I saw while I was asleep. It seemed more than a dream." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really? There's more than one Arval?" Shez asked, her eyes looking over to the side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How am I supposed to know?" Her ghostly friend asked, their words unheard by Byleth. "Though if it is anything similar, she likely will awaken her own powers, making her that much more difficult to defeat." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, Arval isn't sure, but you might get your own powers!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…that's-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Kids, get out here!" Jeralt’s voice caught their attention, an edge to his voice telling them something serious was going on. Immediately rushing out, both girls grabbed their weapons as they went to meet their dad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Who was hanging out with three people who seemed to be their age, if a bit younger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The trio seemed to be wearing uniforms of three different colors, red, blue, and yellow respectively. As the three of them noticed the sisters, Byleth couldn't help but feel the white-haired girl immediately begin to evaluate them with her gaze. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Get a move on kids, we have bandits to deal with." Jeralt said, explaining what was going on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I would like to apologize for leading them here," the blond boy said, a tenseness to his voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If it helps, we can provide back up to you, our oh so wonderful saviors," the dark-skinned boy said with a mirth that didn't reach his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, I dunno, if it's just some bandits, By and I can probably deal with it," Shez said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We should still be careful," Byleth responded as she saw Ezra approaching. "Even if they're just bandits, we shouldn't underestimate them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You got that right," Ezra said as he came up. "Spotted the bandits, they don't look well armed but there's a lot of them. We're in for some trouble if we just try to defend." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then we should aim for the leader." Byleth suggested as she faced her dad. "They might scatter if the leader falls, you and the rest can focus on defending the town, while these three, Shez, and I act as an attacking force." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you require our assistance, we would be glad to help,” the white-haired girl declared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good, Shez and I will lead the way," Byleth decided, walking past the three as Shez drew both her swords. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, try not to fall behind~!" Shez teased as she followed alongside Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Glancing behind her, Byleth could see the trio had armed themselves with an axe, spear, and bow respectively. It also seemed like they were indeed battle tested as they didn't show any hesitation in following behind them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I must say, you have a strange aura about you…if you really are a mercenary, show me what you can do," the white-haired one requested, speaking to Byleth as she stood by her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Stick close then," Byleth replied as she looked out at the field before them to watch the bandits approaching. "Shez, you and Spear take the left side of the watchtower. Archer, make sure to cover us." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Got it!" Shez shouted, before immediately rushing forward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey, wait, please!" Spear called to her as she charged forward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She seems quite reckless," Axe muttered as she and Byleth moved to face off against some bandits. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She knows what to do," Byleth replied even as she split her attention between the bandits and Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Get those brats!" screamed the bandits rushing towards Byleth and her companion. A rather large group, it seemed, which would be trouble to try to face head on, so best to make them scatter. Raising a hand, a sigil appeared for a moment before a ball of fire crashed into the bandit group, causing them to scream and scatter before an axe head buried itself into one of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not a bad showing from Axe. She clearly knew what she was doing, though Byleth wouldn't consider her an expert. Better than a novice, at least, and the white-haired girl showed some impressive strength with how easily she used the heavy weapon, striking with brutal blows that were more than enough to cut down poorly armed and armored bandits.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth, meanwhile, brushed a hand over her blade and set it aflame, illuminating the area and drawing the bandits’ attention towards her. Some stumbled back at the sight and Byleth mentally marked them as likely cowards that would retreat if the more bold ones went down. So she focused on those bolder men, striding forward and decapitating the first bandit that seemed to be yelling orders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were screams and one bandit broke and ran, dropping his sword as he went, and Byleth continued on her way in the meantime, cutting down two more bandits before catching an axe blade and igniting the axeman on the spot. Fire had a way of making enemies rout, so Byleth was generous, if judicial, in her use of it. She didn’t want to set the forest alight, after all, so keeping a firm control of the magic she used to burn foes alive was a must.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A hiss of pain drew her attention back towards the white-haired girl. Byleth wasn’t completely sure if she was a client, considering she volunteered to help, but the girl was under her command at the moment so she flicked a hand, casting a basic Heal to mend the cut across her shoulder before Byleth moved in and stabbed straight through the swordsman fighting her potential client.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–Hm. I had that handled.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth just raised an eyebrow at the girl. “Focus on the spearmen. Swords are more flexible up close and you have to commit too much to the blow to deflect them properly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The girl blinked at her, but Byleth was already moving. She decided to demonstrate what she meant for the white-haired girl and found an axe-wielding bandit that was still trying to press the attack. She removed the head of his axe from its handle, then removed the top half of his head from the lower half. “See?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I do see your meaning, yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were a surprisingly large number of bandits. Byleth made a mental note to ask Victor if any of the bandits here happened to have open bounties on their heads before continuing her work in collecting them. A glance over showed the other members of her group were handling the bandits well enough; Spear was backing up Shez as she cut her way through every foe in front of her, a whirlwind of death as usual that he was at least doing a bit to help by taking out the stragglers, while Archer picked off foes from a distance. It was always handy to have a balanced group, though Byleth kept herself focused as she looked for the potential leader of the bandits. There would be someone barking orders somewhere–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Damn it, I’ll get at least one of you brats!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth was moving before the last word finished, turning to see a large, rough-looking brigand bringing an axe down on the white-haired girl as she stumbled backwards. Byleth threw herself forward, trying to bring her sword up and cursing the aggravating irony of the situation as the axe blade descended towards her head–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing?” complained an oddly familiar voice as everything froze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth couldn’t really respond, on account of being frozen. Then the world seemed to shatter and she was back in that dark void.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Honestly, what were you trying to accomplish with that stunt?” the girl on the throne continued to complain, looking distinctly unimpressed with Byleth, “Are you trying to get me killed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked. “You? Why would you die?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course I would die if you did! Is it not obvious that we are connected? Ugh, and this is twice now you’ve interrupted my sleep…” The girl grumbled, before regarding Byleth again. “Well? Do you have anything to say for yourself now that I have aided you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Thank you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why do you phrase that as though it’s a question? Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, so thank me properly!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth placed a hand on her chest and gave the strange girl a deep bow. “Thank you for saving my life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph, there we are, much better! Now then, I am Sothis, though you may also address me as ‘The Beginning’. It is another name I am known by.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, okay. I know how that works. You’re Sothis, the Beginning, then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it isn’t a title, it is another name–Oh, never mind. You really are a dull child, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been called that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sothis frowned. “You have? By whom? That is an immensely rude thing to call someone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth decided not to comment. “Do you know someone named Arval?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Arval? Arval…No, I can’t say that name stirs any feelings of familiarity in me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay. My sister has her own strange ghost person in her head so I thought I should ask.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am not a ghost! And why would I know a ghost, hm? Just because I am speaking to you does not mean I have knowledge of every mystical being in existence!” Sothis shouted, quite annoyed. "But that is not the important thing!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's not?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course it isn't, the important part is what are you going to do now!" Frowning, she pointed at her. "I may have stopped the flow of time, but that has only delayed the inevitable." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You stopped time?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I am… not sure how I managed it, but we must plan what to do. This is only a temporary measure, so the axe will strike us down unless we do something." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can I move while you have everything stopped?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, I am not certain why, but that power feels beyond me. Even then, your body might not be able to handle the strain of moving while the flow of time is stopped." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…can you make it go backwards then?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? You mean reverse the flow of time?" That got Sothis to pause. "...Yes, I believe that is within my power. Though I must warn you, I can only send you back just a few moments. Though I trust you'll be able to make a far better decision now that you know what's to come." Moving her hands, a large sigil appeared, far more complicated than Byleth had seen before. "Now go, you who bear the flames within. Drift through the flow of time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And, Byleth watched everything slowly move in reverse, as if everyone was a puppet on strings. Eyes snapping towards the bandit leader, Byleth took a moment to study him and see the arc of his attack, as well as where he was coming from, letting her know how to properly counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Normally she'd just blast him with magic, but she was still annoyed at the irony! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As such, once she felt her body under her control again, she rushed forward, her sword parrying the brigand’s axe as he was in the middle of his yell. And, with his eyes distracted watching his axe fly away, he was left completely open for Byleth to thrust her blade forward, sinking it into his chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Guh-! …I never should have… listened to that idiot…" the bandit leader said, before falling over, his death making the remaining bandits flee. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Are you okay?" Byleth asked the white-haired girl, noting that she had lost her axe at one point, and was seemingly going to defend herself with a dagger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...How were you able to-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The Knights of Seiros are here!" came a loud, unfamiliar voice, instantly putting Byleth on edge as she spun around, getting into a defensive stance. "Hey, the thieves are getting away, go after them!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh, why him…" Looking to the side, she saw Jeralt had come over, riding Argo as he frowned at the knights. "Stand down kid, we're not getting into a fight with them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Okay." Still feeling tense, Byleth sheathed her sword, noticing Shez running up to them, with Spear and Archer close behind. However, before the one leading the knights could approach, a different voice called out to them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Edelgard, there you are!" shouted an orange-haired boy, dressed in a similar uniform to the three, but lacking the colored cape. "My apologies for not arriving sooner, are you safe?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, Ferdinand," Edelgard, which was apparently her name, said with barely disguised annoyance. "Why are you here?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As your trusted shield, I could not return to the academy while you are in danger! Especially not when leaving you with the likes of Dimitri and Claude. Who would know what–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ferdinand, I would ask you to refrain from making such comments out loud." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, of course." Nodding, Ferdinand seemed to notice something. "Ah, Edelgard, are you hurt?!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was injured, but this mercenary here already healed me up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so? In that case, on behalf of the Empire, I, Ferdinand von Aegir, thank you for assisting our future emperor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Emperor?" Byleth asked, glancing at Edelgard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She seemed to steady herself at the question, the annoyance fading from her body in favor of a regal bearing as she gave Byleth a short bow. “Indeed, I am Edelgard von Hresvelg, Imperial Princess of the Empire of Adrestia. Thank you for saving my life from those thugs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooo, wow, By! Look at you, saving a princess!” Shez teased, giving her sister a light shove on the shoulder, “How heroic of you~!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth simply shoved her sister back before nodding to the apparent princess. “It’s no trouble. You were on my side, so I kept you safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“An admirable attitude to take,” Spear said with a smile that didn’t look quite natural. Byleth had some experience with forcing a smile and the blond seemed like he needed to use actual effort to keep his up. “I must thank you as well, on behalf of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Ooo, is my buddy Lance actually a prince?” Shez asked, her interest turning from one royal to the other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, I am. I am Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd, crown prince of the Holy King–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, we’re going to be here all night if you keep using the full title,” Archer interrupted, before raising a hand in greeting, “Hey there, Claude von Riegan, heir to leader of the Alliance. Not quite as ‘prestigious’ as the prince and princess here, but I like to think I’m a close equivalent.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you’re the new kid!” Shez exclaimed, earning a chuckle from Claude.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m the ‘new kid’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, Duke Riegan’s new kid. Well, grandson, I think? Remember By, we were in Leicester back when the other guy died.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth did recall that. She also remembered her father muttering about being cursed after he heard another major noble died while he was in their country. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well that’s interesting. You two travel to Leicester often?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, it’s where we get the most work. In fact, you may be familiar with our names!” Shez got the grin she tended to get when she was feeling boastful. Not for the first time, Byleth was glad she was good at keeping her face neutral. “For you see, we are the Eisner Sisters! Shez, the elder sister, otherwise known as the Violet Demon! And Byleth, the younger sister, also known as the Ashen Dragon! Defeaters of the Scorpions, slayers of the Red Tyrant, liberators of small villages all across Fodlan! And also daughters of the best merc in the business, of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That would be Jeralt the Blade Breaker then,” Edelgard noted, and Shez immediately grinned at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Got it exactly! See By, told you we were recognizable.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She recognized dad, not us,” Byleth commented, prompting a pout from her younger sister, “Also, I’m older.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, no, I still won last time! And I definitely killed more bandits than you! I took down thirteen, how much did you get?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth gestured towards the leader’s corpse. “I killed the leader.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s still one, it shouldn’t count for more.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not the rule we decided on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez mock-glared at her, then let out a groan as she let her head fall. “Yeah okay, I guess you’re older now…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Excuse me, but I don’t quite understand…what that was,” Dimitri said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a thing we do,” Byleth explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hhh…ah, yeah, I’m adopted so we’re not sure what my age actually is,” Shez explained, popping up from her fake despair pretty quickly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re pretty sure she’s at least a year younger than me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup, no way to tell. We’re probably twins.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The gathered royals and nobles took a moment to look at the taller, openly smiling purple-haired girl in brown and red-orange clothes, before glancing at the shorter, neutral-faced, teal-haired woman in black and gray clothes, with the only real hint of color being some pink lining. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds about right to me,” Claude said, grinning at the “twins”. “So, you usually work for the Alliance, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup! Lots of Leicester nobles like to hire us to deal with stuff. We do work for the Empire nobles too, though we tend to work for small villages like this one too,” Shez explained, before grinning at Claude, “Why? Are you looking to hire us, your grace?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, no need to bring out the fancy forms of address here. I’m not the duke yet, and Claude works fine for me. Besides, I was hoping to get to know you two better before jumping straight to making offers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri cleared his throat. “Then, if I may offer my own proposition, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus could well use exceptional individuals of your skill. Please, do consider returning to the Kingdom with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would think a prince would have more dignity than to beg for aid,” Ferdinand commented, making Dimitri straighten with a frown directed towards him, “Though if we are all making offers, then I, Ferdinand von Aegir–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Should let me be the one to speak with them,” Edelgard interrupted, giving her “shield” an annoyed look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, of course Edelgard, you do need the experience in negotiating for yourself. Please, go right ahead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...By your leave, I suppose.” Edelgard turned to the sisters, her annoyance carefully hidden by the time she faced them. “I will not belabor the point. As heir to the Adrestian Empire, I would be pleased to see your skills lent to the betterment of my nation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm…alright, alright, I hear all of you,” Shez said, nodding along, “And I know an easy way to solve this. Which of you can pay the best?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth elbowed her sister. “We’re under contract with Remire Village at the moment, so we’ll have to speak with our father.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I fully understand–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? You would so readily turn down an offer like this?” Ferdinand seemed put out. “If it is a matter of payment, I can assure you, the Empire is able to offer far more than a wasteland like Faerghus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri twitched. “...Ferdinand, I would request that you not openly insult my homeland.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my sincere apologies, your highness. I am curious though, how much do you think you could offer our mercenary friends here from your meager coffers?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, I knew things were bad between the Kingdom and the Empire, but I didn’t think Ferd would be so open about it,” Claude commented in a stage whisper to the two mercs, prompting a thoughtful look from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…you know, By, it would mean a lot of work for us if Faerghus and Adrestia went to war–Ow! Hey!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not in front of the nobles,” Byleth chided, prompting an amused noise from Claude.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I can tell you two are going to be fun. Think you might be coming back to the monastery with us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? You’re from a monastery–” Shez paused, before she frowned. “...Are you from Garreg Mach?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s where we’re coming from, yup. What, the Officer Academy uniforms didn’t give it away?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Haven’t seen them before. And, uh, no, we probably won’t be coming back with you guys then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And why would that be?” Edelgard asked, ignoring the continued “discussion” between Ferdinand and Dimitri.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude raised an eyebrow, still grinning. “No, I don’t think any of us do. Are you two not so fond of the church or something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez folded her arms over her chest. “If you’re asking that question, you already know you shouldn’t be asking it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds a little recursive to me, but alright, I get what you mean. Shame though, I think it would’ve been fun to see you two around more often.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright kids, time to get packed up,” Jeralt said as he came over to their group, along with the mustachioed knight from earlier, “We’re moving out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We are?” Shez blinked. “Wait, where are we going?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Garreg Mach Monastery,” their dad answered, before sighing, “Don’t make that face.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude felt his grin grow and Edelgard raised an eyebrow as the two heirs saw the Eisner sisters clearly grimace at the thought of going to Garreg Mach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, so these are your daughters then!” The knight, meanwhile, seemed happy to see them, judging by the bright smile on his friendly face. “Hello to both of you! My name is Alois, and I was your father’s comrade in arms back when he was the captain of the Knights of Seiros!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Okay,” Shez replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth was slightly more polite, offering him a nod. “It is nice to meet you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Likewise! I must say, I wasn’t expecting a reunion like this with my former captain! I suppose you could call this a </span>
  <em>
    <span>night</span>
  </em>
  <span> of Seiros!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sisters looked at each other, as though confirming that they did hear the exact same thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Do you think it's too late to run?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They have horses, they would catch up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, I think I could outspeed a horse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…maybe if I carry you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude had a big grin on his face, watching the interplay while Edelgard sighed in exasperation. “Oh you two are going to be great.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>"If I may ask, you mentioned fighting a 'red tyrant' before. What exactly did you mean by that?" Edelgard asked mid-march to Garreg Mach, the young mercenaries and students walking together behind the knights and rest of the mercs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, interested in hearing more of our exploits huh? Well I hope you're ready for the astounding tale of when By and I defeat a crimson demonic be-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It was a crawler that was weirdly red," Byleth cut in, getting Shez to stumble. "Ate some goats, so we were hired to take it out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw come on By, how are we gonna get famous if we don't play up our achievements!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Gotta agree with your sister here," Claude piped up, "If nothing else, you gotta know how to tell a story if you wanna impress someone."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged in response. "I'm not one for embellishments." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even so, fighting a demonic beast is no small feat. You should be proud of your accomplishments," Dimitri noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Though I'm sure you two have faced plenty aside from that," Edelgard guessed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh yeah, totally, but that one was the first job By and I did on our own, so I'm pretty proud of it!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Speaking of, I believe you've said you've taken jobs in the Alliance and Empire, correct?” Dimitri asked, “Have you not traveled up to the kingdom before?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't see why they would," Edelgard commented. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, we kinda had a job go sour there," Shez said, as Byleth took in some slow breaths. "But uh, mind telling us what's up between the Kingdom and Empire? Kinda out of the loop here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, allow me-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll explain, Ferdinand," Edelgard spoke up, getting the orange-haired noble to stay silent. "Tensions have been quite high between the empire and the kingdom as of a few years ago, thanks to both the passing of my uncle, and the Tragedy of Duscur. While no evidence was ever brought forth to say the two incidents were connected, many still believe they are." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Staying silent, Byleth couldn't help but notice Edelgard didn't seem particularly sad at mentioning her uncle passing away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, but as the Prince of Faerghus, it is my hope that I can help mend the cracks between our two nations." Ferdinand audibly scoffed, but said nothing further as Dimitri tried to keep his pleasant smile in place. “That aside, are you two at all familiar with the Officer’s Academy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope,” Shez promptly replied, “I’ve got no idea about any of it, and By’s probably got even less since she’s not especially curious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. That’s a rude thing to say about your sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s not wrong,” Byleth said, “Shez gets more interested in weird things than I do. She spent years trying to find the last book in this series on magic we have.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, it’s not my fault they hid all the interesting stuff in the fourth book! Why even have a third when it was mostly repeating stuff in the first one, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t repeating anything, it was a more in depth look at complicated spells–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah but it didn’t have any dark magic stuff in it, so it didn’t help me at all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re a dark mage?” Edelgard asked, glancing at Shez with another appraising look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, I’m a natural at it. By’s the opposite though, she’s way better at light stuff than I’ll ever get. She’s also better at fire stuff while I’m…kind of good at ice? I mean, I’m decent at it, but I’m really more of a sword girl all around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “We each have our specialties.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That we do! Speaking of, is that why you three have different color capes? Noticed you used different weapons." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, no, the three of us are the leaders of the three houses of the academy,” Dimitri answered, “The houses are where students from each respective nation gather. The Blue Lions of the Kingdom, The Golden Deer of the Alliance, and The Black Eagles of the Empire."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Each year students go to the academy in hopes of becoming skilled officers,” Edelgard continued, “Be they nobles or commoners." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Though it's mainly nobles,” Claude added, “Not that many commoners can afford to go. Edelgard’s class only has one commoner this year, for example." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And Dorothea has rightfully earned her place in the academy. That aside, the academy year had only just started, hence why we were out doing training exercises that night when the bandits attacked us," Edelgard explained, before letting out a sigh. "Thankfully it seems everyone was able to return to the academy safely thanks to the knights."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth couldn't help but take note of that. It was already odd that Kostas blamed an 'idiot' for what occurred, but that could be written off as him blaming one of his subordinates for bringing the idea up. The fact that the academy had just started and the students just so happened to be training in the same area as the bandits, however, was oddly timed. Had they been hired by someone? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yup, speaking of, you two should stop by if you have the time, plenty of faces and names you should get to know if you're planning on continuing the family business in the future," Claude suggested. "And if it helps you decide on working with the Alliance, well that's just a win win."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then I extend the same offer for you to visit the Black Eagles!" Ferdinand said, making Edelgard roll her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And of course my house would be more than happy to have you stop by," Dimitri added, rounding out the offers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I guess we'll see," Shez said without committing to anything, her eyes looking forward as Garreg Mach came into view. “...Wow, that’s a big place.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was. Garreg Mach Monastery was certainly the most imposing location the Eisner sisters had ever visited. Enbarr was close, but it was still a city, and didn’t carry the same kind of ancient majesty the castle atop the mountains did. Maybe the Imperial Palace would be comparable, Byleth considered, but then she never did see that directly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Big is one word for it, sure,” Claude commented with some amusement, prompting an amused huff from Byleth’s younger sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah, laugh at the poor, simple merc girl. Sorry we can’t all live in giant palaces like </span>
  <em>
    <span>your grace</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she teased back, her smile taking any sting from the words as she overemphasized his title.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, I didn’t mean to offend. But if you’re missing out on that much, maybe you could come by Derdriu sometime and I’ll give you a tour?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, but I wouldn’t want to impose on your noble sensibilities, your grace! I might track mud on your carpet!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, it’s okay, I’m rich. I’ll just burn it and get a new one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard sighed while Ferdinand didn’t seem able to tell if he should be offended or not, staring between Claude and Shez in some confusion. Dimitri wasn’t much better, though he didn’t seem offended so much as he couldn’t tell if the two were mocking each other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth, meanwhile, simply flicked her sister on the back of her head, earning a yelp from Shez. Thankfully, she didn’t have to listen to her sister bantering with her new friend for much longer as the students went off to join the rest of their classmates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Make sure to swing by our classroom later!” Claude called out as he left, “I’d love to have you two if you join up!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! No promises!” Shez shouted back, prompting a sigh from Byleth. Well, at least her younger sister was making friends. She always was better at being sociable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth felt a frown come to her face. Not because of Shez; she was more than used to her being better with people, at least on a first meeting. No, what was putting her on edge was a strange feeling of being watched…And it wasn’t long before she noticed the source.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she looked up at the strange, green-haired woman staring down at her, Byleth couldn’t help but remember what Shez said to her back in Enbarr. That strange feeling of looking at a person, and immediately getting chills from the sight.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Garreg Mach Monastery was definitely the fanciest place Shez had ever been in. Big windows, clean floors, weird artsy stuff on the walls; all very fancy and pretty out of her usual realm of experience. It was kind of funny though, because Byleth actually seemed to be the more tense of the two of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, it’s gonna be alright,” she muttered to her sister, giving her a glance as they were led to meet the Archbishop. Which, wow, they were meeting a lot of important people today. “That Catherine lady might be dead already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s not really why I’m tense, but thank you,” Byleth mumbled back. "Kinda hope she isn't so I can beat her up."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, well, here's hoping she isn't then," Shez said, smiling at her sister as they continued walking. And well, she was ready for whatever happened, but who knows, maybe things will be okay? The three house leaders and that Ferdinand guy seemed nice enough, even if they didn't get along with one another. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At least, she hoped they would, but she still felt very tense as two green-haired individuals came out to meet them in the audience chamber. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you for your patience, Jeralt. My name is Seteth, I am the advisor to the archbishop," the bearded guy said, addressing only their dad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right. Hello." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It has been a long time, Jeralt. I wonder if it is the will of the Goddess that let us meet once again," the archbishop said, before her eyes moved over to Byleth. "If nothing else, I see she has blessed you with fatherhood." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, yes, the two were born many years after I left the monastery." Jeralt said, getting Rhea to glance at Shez for a moment. "Sadly their mother passed away from illness." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I see, my condolences." Rhea said, before looking back at the two girls. "So, you two are sisters?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, yeah! Twins to be specific!" Shez said, deciding to lie for the sake of her dad and sister. "Name’s Shez!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Byleth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A fine name." Shez had a feeling she was only referring to Byleth there. "From the bottom of my heart, thank you for saving the students of this academy. Jeralt, I assume you already know what I wish to ask?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alois already asked in your stead. I'm honored you want me to rejoin the knights, but…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Your apprehension stings, but I implore you to say yes. As for your…daughters, I assume Alois also informed you what I wish to ask?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ask us what?" Shez asked as she raised an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"During the training exercise, one of the professors who was supposed to lead one of the houses this year chose to flee. As such, I cannot in good faith allow him to teach should he return. So, I wish to ask that your eldest join the academy as a professor. Your youngest would of course also be allowed to join as a student." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah woah woah, hold on, are you sure that’s a good idea?” Shez asked, prompting a slight frown from the archbishop, “I mean, I know I’m awesome, but I have no idea how to be a professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I meant your elder sister, child.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah? I’m the older one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea looked between Byleth and Shez, her small frown still present along with a very skeptical look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth, meanwhile, just shrugged. “I wouldn’t mind being a student. I don’t think you should make Shez a teacher though, she’s not that smart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, exactly,” Shez agreed, nodding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I was under the impression from Alois that Byleth was the elder.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh, right, I took out the bandit leader so I'm the older one now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooooh yeah, forgot about that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I ask that you act seriously when in front of the archbishop,” Seteth chided as he looked at the two siblings, his frown very evident, “And Lady Rhea, are you certain–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I supposed they are just tired from their journey here,” the archbishop interrupted, ignoring her chamberlain, “For now, I must step away. Until tomorrow, farewell.” A smile on her face again, Rhea nodded to the trio, before she and Seteth left the audience chamber, heading back to her office. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth leaned to watch them leave, still not sure what she felt from that strange woman, but well aware that it was putting her on edge…That, and she could clearly see Seteth starting to complain to Rhea about her decision the instant he thought they were out of earshot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well… I suppose that could have gone worse,” Jeralt muttered as he pinched the bridge of his nose. “Guess we don’t have much of an option.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We could always try fighting our way out.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’d have to flee Fodlan entirely if we did, and that’s assuming we manage to escape,” Jeralt replied to Shez, before leaning in to whisper. “Just stay on your guard, okay? I don’t know what she’s thinking, but she’s obviously planning something.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure thing dad!” Shez said, grinning as Byleth nodded in response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, you must be the new professor. My, Alois didn’t mention how handsome you are~!” Blinking, Shez looked over to see two people walking in, one of whom was leaning in close to her dad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Er, no, you have the wrong person. That’d be her,” Jeralt said, gesturing to Byleth. “You two can handle things from here, good luck.” With a nod, Jeralt left, leaving them with the two new people.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “Oh my, I didn’t expect you to be so young.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just because one is young does not mean they are not competent,” the older guy said, before facing the sisters. “My name is Hanneman, one of the professors of this academy, and a crest scholar. If you have a crest of your own, I ask that you pay me a visit so I may study it if possible.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I am Manuela Casagranda, another professor here, but I am also the head physician, a songstress, and available~” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A songstress?” Byleth asked, apparently wanting to know about that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course! In fact, before I came here, I was a member of the Mittelfrank Opera Company~ Perhaps you’ve been there before?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, By, didn’t we go to a play there before?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, about six years ago.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, in that case, it was after I left, but you must have seen my protege, Dorothea? She’s actually attending the academy this year.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused, tilting her head in thought before nodding. “Right, we did see her. She was the girl playing the noblewoman in the play we saw.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah! She was the Mystical Songstress!” Shez grinned, nudging her sister with an elbow. “You know, the girl you thought was cute~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” And it seemed that teasing immediately caught Manuela’s attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I said she was pretty, not cute,” Byleth responded, not that Shez accepted that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretty, cute, it’s the same difference! You liked her! You wanted to get her flowers, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were the one that suggested that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I'm sure she’d be happy to get flowers from a fan, but, as her mentor, I do hope you’ll watch yourself around her,” Manuela warned with a tone that made even Shez feel like she was getting threatened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now, now Manuela. I’m sure she’ll be on her best behavior,” Hanneman said, speaking up for Byleth. “As for now, why don’t you two go for a stroll around the academy? I’m sure you’ll want to familiarize yourselves with the area, and of course, my office is open if you’ll allow me to examine you for crests.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, I guess you have a point, it would be a good idea for them to get to know the students too. If you can, stop by my office as well. As the physician I also need to make sure you have a clean bill of health.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yeah. We’ll make sure to stop by later!” Shez said, before grabbing onto Byleth and pulling her out of the room. “Well…didn't expect to end up here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, especially as a teacher…or a student, in your case.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Think we can leave early if I do poorly enough?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They might only kick you out.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, this place would probably try to get only me out…well, might as well make the most of it. Hey, do you think we should go to the marketplace for some flow–Gah!” Before she could finish her teasing, Shez felt Byleth elbow her in the side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let's just get this over with.” Byleth muttered as they went downstairs, finding someone waiting for them in the reception hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello. Is it correct to assume that you two will be joining the academy?” Edegard asked, the young emperor-to-be greeting the two as she got up from where she was sitting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, By is gonna be a teacher apparently, and I guess I'll be a student?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard didn’t seem too happy with that information. “Pity. I was hoping you would be lending your services to the Empire. I don’t suppose you were told which class you’d be teaching?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, and they didn’t say which class Shez will be joining,” Byleth answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would assume they would put you two in the same class.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shrugged. “Eh, dunno. That might sound fun, but also it feels weird to think of By as a teacher.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that so? Well regardless, I hope to have the chance to learn from you two. Do either of you two have any questions about the Black Eagles?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I haven't really met any of them… actually, do you mind if I ask a favor?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Go ahead.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You mind showing By around? Since she’s gonna be a teacher, she probably needs to learn more about this place than me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You still need to look around as well,” Byleth pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but I can take my time, you’re the one who has to make the important choices as a teacher.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would be perfectly fine with escorting our new professor around the Academy,” Edelgard replied. She seemed kind of pleased with the suggestion, which Shez was happy to see. “Perhaps I could even convince you to consider teaching my class specifically?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Byleth answered with a shrug, before glancing at her sister. “Shez, don’t get lost.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh come on, you don’t need to tell me that. I’ll be fine!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth’s expression remained skeptical, but Shez didn’t pay much attention to that as she walked off. Plus, Arval popped out a moment later, so that took her attention instead. “Hm. Your sister feels different.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She does?” Shez glanced back towards Byleth, but she and Edelgard were already out of view. “How so?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure. It likely has to do with that dream she claimed she had. Perhaps she has awakened her powers already and chosen not to tell you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahh, that would make sense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re not bothered by her keeping information from you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re kidding, right? When would she have told me? Around the knights or the nobles?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. You could stand to be more concerned about this. Something unusual is going on with your sister. Perhaps a dormant power that will change her very being–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know you don’t like her, Arval, so cut it out with the doomsaying,” Shez chided as she started to walk, just sort of meandering at the moment, though she kept her tone low enough to avoid looking like a weirdo talking to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not doomsaying, I’m just saying you may be doomed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s the same thing!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it? I didn’t notice.” Arval smiled slightly as Shez muttered under her breath about “sarcastic little pricks”, before giving a glance around the monastery halls. “I have to say though, I do share your sister’s discomfort with this place. There’s a disquieting feeling to the air here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess? I just don’t like the knights,” she whispered, before very deliberately taking a staircase instead of continuing to walk towards the knights she noticed. “...I really hope that Catherine woman really isn’t here. I know Byleth wants payback, but that’s going to go bad if they go up against each other.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re actually trying to be the voice of reason? Did someone replace my partner when I wasn’t looking?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh ha ha, very funny. I can get worried about my family–Huh.” Shez blinked, staring into the room filled with bookshelves that she just walked into. “Is this a library?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed it is, young lady,” a nearby old man said as he noticed her. He had a kind smile on his face while he rested on his cane, but something about him just set Shez’s instincts off. “Welcome to Garreg Mach monastery’s library. I am Tomas, the head librarian. Might you be a new student?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"U-Uh, yeah, just wandering around and seeing what's… around." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so? Well you are always welcome to visit the library should you wish to. We likely have the greatest collection of books in Fodlan, if I do say so myself." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, well, I'll make sure to stop by when I have the chance!" With a shaky grin, Shez immediately turned around to head out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is everything okay, partner?" Arval asked, peering curiously down at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I honestly don't know. That old guy just set off all my instincts, so I didn't want to be there any longer." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yes, I suppose there was something odd about him. Not that I know what that is, just that he almost seemed familiar…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Arval, have you haunted other people before?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why would I do that if you are my partner in destiny?" Arval asked with a quirked eyebrow as Shez went back downstairs. "Regardless, I assume you're making no plans to go to the library again?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why would I?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Perhaps they have that tome you were looking for?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Stop being right sometimes, Arval."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I refuse." Letting out a huff, Shez began to wander around again. She had to admit, this place was far bigger once you were actually inside than it looked like from the outside, and she was starting to get worried she'd get lost easily here.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"At least you'll have me to guide you around, should you care to listen to me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe? Just didn't expect a monastery to be this big. I thought it'd be just a slightly bigger chapel." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And where did you expect the classes to take place?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shrugged in response. "Dunno, never went to school before." Though her wandering did come to a stop as she arrived at the mess hall for the monastery, a rather delicious smell reaching her nose. "Oh wow, this place smells great." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course you'd be happy with this place." Shez chose to ignore Arval as she began to march up to the counter, ready to get some food, only to bump into someone as she went. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, sorry–Shez?" A familiar looking gray haired boy looked surprised to see her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ashe? What are you doing here?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm a student here." That explained the uniform. "What are you doing here? Are Byleth and Captain Jeralt here too?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, uh, well I'm going to be a student here, and yeah, didn't you see Byleth? Pretty sure she was going to the classrooms, unless that empire princess took her elsewhere…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Lady Edelgard? Ah, I can see why she wouldn't take her to the Blue Lions classroom then…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She did mention things aren't well between the Kingdom and the Empire," Arval pointed out, making Shez realize it probably wasn't the smartest idea to send Byleth off with the princess. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, I'm sure she's fine." </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Your sister is rather carefree isn't she?" Edelgard asked as she watched Shez walk off, leaving Byleth alone with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yeah," Byleth responded, suddenly very aware that it was up to her to be sociable without Shez helping her out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If I may ask, since she mentioned being adopted, how did you meet? I understand that some mercenary groups might employ a chore child, but I was not aware a wandering band would adopt someone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I shot her with an arrow." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Excuse me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was out hunting, and I accidentally shot her when she made me miss a deer," Byleth explained as if she wasn't talking about injuring someone. "I carried her back to camp after." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I…see. That must have been quite the first meeting," Edelgard muttered, unsure of what to say. "...she also mentioned being a natural dark mage? That's quite the rarity." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I guess," Byleth said with a shrug. "She picked it up easily." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…ah, but where are my manners? I was going to show you the Black Eagles classroom. I promise you, they're not all like Ferdinand." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you dislike him?" Byleth asked, getting Edelgard to sigh as they began to walk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is not him so much as it is his father. Ever since the passing of my uncle, his father has been pressuring him to protect me. Not even my actual retainer is this suffocating," Edelgard complained, her annoyance quite evident. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Do you want to spar?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...That's a rather sudden question." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You seem angry, exercise helps me when I'm angry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” Edelgard gave Byleth a considering glance. She hadn’t expected the mercenary to admit to having issues with aggression, particularly given how placid she appeared to be in general. It did bring to mind what Byleth had said earlier, about shooting her sister with an arrow on their first meeting…though perhaps Edelgard was simply seeing connections where there were none, given she also said it was an accident. “...I really should be showing you to my housemates.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We could do that afterwards.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard gave the prospective professor another look, idly wondering if perhaps Byleth was more interested in working out her own aggression than aiding Edelgard with hers. She did seem intriguingly tense around the knights. “Hm. I may as well show you the training field then. Perhaps we’ll run into some classmates along the way?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe. I’ll make sure to meet everyone at some point.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You certainly should, if you’re planning to teach my class,” Edelgard said, a slight smile coming to her face as she regarded her potential professor. She might not have been able to recruit her directly into the Empire, but if she could nudge the elder Eisner sister into favoring her faction…Well, who knew what the future held?</span>

  <p>Perhaps Edelgard should have expected her activity with the new professor would garner attention. Seeing the future emperor of Adrestia walk off towards the training field with an unfamiliar woman would certainly pique interest in her classmates, so some deciding to see what was happening wasn’t out of the question by any means.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t expect a crowd to form though.</p><p> </p><p>“Edelgard, I must protest this!” She also should have expected Ferdinand to show up once he heard what was happening. “You shouldn’t be sparring with this mercenary–”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sparring with our new professor, Ferdinand,” Edelgard stated. It wasn’t completely true, yet, but it would be. “Are you objecting to me receiving instruction from a faculty member now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah–Well, no, I–Hubert, you talk to her!” Ferdinand demanded, looking towards Edelgard’s actual retainer, who was watching the redhead struggle with some amusement. If there was anyone who found Ferdinand more annoying than Edelgard, it was definitely Hubert, and he barely made that a secret.</p><p> </p><p>So he simply nodded to his liege. “Do your best, your highness.”</p><p> </p><p>“I intend to,” Edelgard answered while Ferdinand gaped at the audacity.</p><p> </p><p>“YEAH! YOU GO EDELGARD!” And it seemed more of her classmates were present in the crowd. Not unexpected, and especially expected when it came to Caspar’s presence. The second son of Bergliez looked particularly excited to watch the proceedings, and he’d even dragged his usual companion, Lindhart, along with him, who seemed less than pleased with the interruption to his routine of studying or sleeping. “TAKE THE NEW GIRL DOWN! SHOW HER WE’RE THE BEST!”</p><p> </p><p>…Well, she couldn’t fault his exuberance.</p><p> </p><p>Still, she kept herself focused as she picked up the blunted training axe she intended to use, before turning to face her new professor. Before losing some focus as she found herself staring at said professor, who had removed her long coat and some of her armor to leave herself in a midriff-baring top and shorts. A top that also showed off a generous amount of cleavage. </p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard shook her head, regaining her focus as she strode out onto the field to face off against the so-called Ashen Dragon. A curious name to be sure, though one that appeared earned given her proficiency with flame magic. “May I ask why you chose to remove your armor?”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the first question she intended on asking, but it was a point of curiosity for the young woman as she watched the professor go through a short routine of stretches.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re in your uniform, you’re not armored, it’s a basic spar,” Byleth answered in short order, before plucking a wooden sword from the ground she’d stabbed it into and striding onto the field with an intimidating confidence. There was complete surety in her motions, no hint of unease or even unfamiliarity despite this being her first time on the monastery’s training grounds.</p><p> </p><p>She swung her sword once, twice, testing the weight in her hand and noticeably stopping her motion before either arc could complete. She had total control over the sword in her hand and Edelgard felt her estimation of the woman rise with the sight.</p><p> </p><p>There was no way she was going to let any other class take this woman as their professor.</p><p> </p><p>“Before we begin, do you have any stipulations for our spar?” Edelgard asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure. Best of three points, each landed hit counts as a point. If blood is drawn, the spar ends, same as if one of us yields.” Edelgard didn’t intend to yield, so that rule was moot. “Other than that, you can feel free to use what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>That was…interesting. Particularly with how the professor phrased it. Edelgard was free to use whatever she wanted to win the duel, but there was no mention of what limits the professor had.</p><p> </p><p>“Understood. Then, shall we begin?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure.” And so it began.</p><p> </p><p>Not that Byleth took advantage of the start to go on the attack. No, she was hanging back, waiting for Edelgard to come to her. The princess recalled what Byleth had said back in the forests, the type of advantage a sword had over an axe in close quarters, so she was leery of making the first move…still, one would never attack if they were always afraid of a counterattack, so she moved in at an angle, searching her professor’s guard for openings–</p><p> </p><p>And then she flinched back as Byleth’s sword was suddenly inches from her face, narrowly missing as she jerked her head to the side.</p><p> </p><p>Dimly, she heard an offended gasp from Ferdinand in the crowd, but she had no time to react as more thrusts and swings suddenly came for her, barely glancing off her axe as she brought it up for defense.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. You might do better with a shield in your off hand,” Byleth noted as she pulled back, studying the shorter girl. “You can use the axe blade as a pseudo shield, but it leaves you open and means you can’t press the attack.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I was unaware you were intending to make this a lesson already, professor,” Edelgard commented, a slight frown coming to her face. The woman didn’t seem to think she was a threat at all.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m supposed to be a professor,” she said as though that was answer enough.</p><p> </p><p>“Should I take this to show you intend to lead my class then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…why not?” She shrugged. “I should probably wait to make the decision, but if I’m teaching you already, I might as well. Also–”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard winced as the sword suddenly jabbed into her shoulder, quick and efficient.</p><p> </p><p>“Keep aware of the situation, especially when talking on the battlefield. If you can guarantee you won’t get hit, talk. If not, don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. One point to you then,” Edelgard affirmed, before tightening her grip on her axe. She had no intention of lowering her guard again while on the field with Byleth.</p><p> </p><p>Something her professor appeared to approve of, judging by her nod before the two of them began their bout again.</p><p> </p><p>This time, Edelgard stayed on the offensive, unwilling to give the professor a chance to decide the tempo of the fight. A strange awareness came over her as she did though, noticing now how her own swings differed from Byleth’s. Using an axe really was about committing to an attack; she could move it as easily as swinging a sword, but to actually do damage, she needed to follow through. A sword could flick in and out, stabbing or cutting, but an axe was a weapon of pure cutting force. It couldn’t be used shallowly, it needed commitment to each blow. So, then, how to work around the inherent advantages the lighter weapon had against her own?</p><p> </p><p>A lance could beat a sword through its longer reach, but an axe would beat a lance by virtue of being too heavy to defend against. How could she use that advantage here though?</p><p> </p><p>Her brow furrowed in determined focus, taking note of how her professor didn’t move to block her blows, just deflect them, redirecting their momentum and costing Edelgard the effort of having to pull back. Perhaps if she forced her to block them then…Edelgard pushed forward, gritting her teeth and swinging her axe with a brutal force for her professor’s head.</p><p> </p><p>And this time, her professor caught the axe’s head on her blade, her eyes narrowing for the slightest instant as she was forced to block the heavy blow. Not that Edelgard was foolish enough to get into a struggle with the professor, instead rebounding her axe off the sword and then swinging all the harder on the return, aiming to at least force the professor to her knees–</p><p> </p><p>And then the axe was smacked out of her hand when Byleth chose to swing for it instead of blocking.</p><p> </p><p>“Not bad,” the mercenary noted, as though she hadn’t just completely disarmed Edelgard, “I can see what you were going for. You committed too much to the idea though. It’s not bad to be decisive, you just didn’t consider if I would go on the attack again. Would you mind picking up your axe again?”</p><p> </p><p>The question took a moment to register, but Edelgard nodded once it did. A part of her felt strangely embarrassed, probably at losing so decisively in front of her classmates, but she did move over to her axe and pick it up, before returning to the professor.</p><p> </p><p>“Here, like you were doing before.” She held her sword up in a block, similar to what she did before. “Axe blade right here, alright?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Understood?” Edelgard frowned as she positioned her axe’s head in the same place it had been in while she was trying to batter down the professor.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, could you do that without both hands on the axe?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes? Where are you going with this?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, swing down, but this time, keep the pressure up. Keep me locked in place, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s brow furrowed, but she did as requested, pushing down on her professor, who didn’t seem especially strained.</p><p> </p><p>“Now punch me in the stomach with your free hand.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard blinked. “Ah…excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to if you don’t want to, but I’m very open right now. See? One hand on the hilt and my other hand is on the blade to keep things balanced,” Byleth explained, “So I don’t have any ability to block, at least not easily, if you follow up and hit me in the stomach. Or knife me, that’s also a potential move, though not one you want to do in a spar. Oh, and if you’re a decent caster, magic is also a move you could use in this position.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hm.” Edelgard glanced at her teacher’s bare midriff, which looked more firm than vulnerable, at least to her eyes, before frowning back up at her. “Would that work?”</p><p> </p><p>“In the position you had me in, yup. It might not finish the fight, but it would be a solid hit that could potentially put me down. The stomach’s a vital area without a lot of natural protection since the ribs are more up around your heart. It might not be immediately lethal, but a stomach wound can be very debilitating.”</p><p> </p><p>“I see…hm. And why didn’t you do anything like that in our fight? You’re clearly a skilled magic wielder, so why not bring that to bear here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because I would’ve killed you.”</p><p> </p><p>The statement was so blunt and matter of fact, Edelgard needed a moment to actually register it. “...I am not weak, professor.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not, no. But I kill people for a living. I can hold back, sure, but I don’t like the idea of risking it when you’re just starting out. Even then, if I were to seriously injure you, it might affect your ability to fight even if you were healed properly." </p><p> </p><p>"...One would think you were a fighting instructor before this and not just a mercenary," Edelgard noted, getting Byleth to shake her head. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm going to lead my father's mercenary group in the future, so I need to know these things." With that, Byleth stepped back so they could get into starting positions. "Whenever you're ready." </p><p> </p><p>Keeping a hand on her axe, Edelgard came to a realization that, at least at the moment, she had no way of beating the Mercenary in terms of skill. She herself had seen combat before, but there was no knowing just how that compared to the years of experience her professor had. That being said, she still wanted at least one point off of her, and if there was one thing Edelgard had, it was overwhelming force. </p><p> </p><p>And while it might be cheap to use her two crests against her, Edelgard was feeling petty enough to do so. Charging forward, Edelgard swung her axe with one hand, making it seem like she was listening to Byleth’s instructions, as she felt her crests empowering her. </p><p> </p><p>The slight widening of Byleth’s eyes were the only indication that she realized something was up as she chose to dodge instead of block. With a smirk, Edelgard slammed the axe onto the floor, causing cracks to spread which she quickly took advantage of as she flicked her axe, making debris fly towards the mercenary's face. </p><p> </p><p>Seeing her wince, Edelgard pressed the advantage, rushing forward to catch her professor off guard, her axe flying to strike–and she came to a stop as she felt her sword against her neck, Edelgard’s axe stopping against Byleth’s side. </p><p> </p><p>"Not bad." Byleth said as she rubbed her eyes clear. "That's a point for both of us I suppose." </p><p> </p><p>"...I thought I had you there." </p><p> </p><p>"You almost did. If you had changed your angle of attack, you would have. For reference, blinding your opponent means nothing if they know you're still in front of them," Byleth said after she cleared her eyes. "Still, you improved over the course of that fight." She gave Edelgard a small smile. "I look forward to teaching you." </p><p> </p><p>"...And I look forward to learning from you." </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you. I'm glad you're feeling better." </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me?" </p><p> </p><p>"You don't seem angry anymore. It's good that you're not, anger is unpleasant." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard blinked. She…did feel better. “...Huh.”</p><p> </p><p>And with that, the match ended, and Edelgard felt herself stepping backward to avoid the sudden rush as a number of students crowded around the new professor.</p><p> </p><p>“THAT WAS AMAZING!” The first and loudest of which was, of course, Caspar. The young man looked astounded at Byleth. "I didn't think anyone could beat Edelgard, and you did it no problem!" The young heiress refrained from commenting on his words. </p><p> </p><p>"I wouldn't say it was no problem, but it is a good thing she didn't actually strike Edelgard during the spar," Ferdinand commented, getting Caspar to stare at him in confusion and incredulity.</p><p> </p><p>"Edelgard was a good sparring partner," Byleth said, somewhat agreeing with Ferdinand. </p><p> </p><p>"I must be admitting, I am quite shocked you were able to win against Edelgard," Petra said, doing her best to get her praise across. </p><p> </p><p>"Just goes to show how strong our new professor is~." Dorothea said, leaning forward towards Byleth, and Edelgard couldn't help but note how her classmate’s eyes wandered over their professor's body. "I must say Edie, you certainly brought us a good one~" </p><p> </p><p>"...Excuse me, you're Dorothea, from the opera company?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, that I am! I didn't think even mercenaries knew who I was." </p><p> </p><p>"My family and I saw a play you starred in years ago, it was really nice." The professor seemed to frown for a moment. "I would have preferred a happier ending though." </p><p> </p><p>"Wouldn't we all? Alas, that's how it goes on the stage. But I'm glad you enjoyed the play professor, maybe I can sing for you if we have the time during the school year~?" </p><p> </p><p>"That sounds nice." Byleth said, agreeing to the idea before glancing around. "Is this everyone from the class?" She asked, noting a few other students milling about and not approaching. At least one girl with light-brown hair was watching with an odd expression on her face.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, there's also Lindhart but he fell asleep." Caspar said, gesturing to the mage who had fallen asleep on the floor. </p><p> </p><p>"Bernadetta is also in our class, but she did the running away when she heard a fight was going to happen," Petra said, explaining where their missing classmate was. </p><p> </p><p>“She ran away? Huh. We’ll need to work on that,” Byleth muttered, prompting a bit of amusement from Edelgard at the thought of their teacher trying to keep the easily frightened girl still. While she didn’t doubt her professor was capable, as clearly evidenced by their spar, Bernadetta wasn’t exactly easy to handle.</p><p> </p><p>“If Ferdinand insists on trying to play at being your attendant, the least he could do is actually attend to you, my lady,” Hubert commented while handing Edelgard a handkerchief, his voice too low for their fellow students to notice as they gathered around the professor. </p><p> </p><p>“I sincerely hope he doesn’t try,” Edelgard replied while dabbing the sweat from her brow. “So? What do you think?”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s capable, I’ll give her that. I do appreciate her holding back as well, though I doubt you feel the same, your highness.”</p><p> </p><p>She raised an eyebrow. “Is that approval, Hubert?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s acknowledgement. Do you aim to recruit her?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve made my interest obvious, though it seems the church may be trying to get a hold on Miss Eisner first, given her new position. Oh, and you might be interested in knowing the younger sister is a dark mage.”</p><p> </p><p>Hubert paused, a brief flicker of interest crossing his dark eyes. “Hm. Well that is interesting.”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s also adopted. That might not necessarily suggest anything…”</p><p> </p><p>“But it is better to be careful than careless. If either become a problem…”</p><p> </p><p>“Then we’ll adjust to the Eisner sisters. The elder is to be our professor and the younger is to be a classmate.” She glanced up at her attendant with a slight frown. “So no trying to threaten them away from me. I know how you are with Monica.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have no idea what you mean, your highness. Though I will mention it is a good thing she lives in Ochs and not nearer to the monastery. I would prefer to have some advance notice if she decides to come visit. Again.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s lips twitched in a moment of humor at the thought of her sometimes overly enthusiastic supporter, before she shook it off and turned towards her classmates. “Alright everyone! Do not crowd the professor, she still needs time to tour the grounds.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, of course! And I would be glad to show you–” </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard stepped up to the professor and placed a hand on her shoulder, steering her away from Ferdinand. “No, Ferdinand, this is my task to handle as the house leader. Why don’t you find Professor Eisner’s younger sister? She’s joining as a student as well, so recruiting her–”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yes! That would be quite the boon to our house! Excellent idea, Edelgard! We’ll make a capable emperor of you yet!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Well now her earlier annoyance was returning.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. You want to spar again?” Professor Eisner asked, glancing at Edelgard, who did consider it for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>“...No, we really should move on. There is much more to see around here, after all.”</p><hr /><p>“Oh wow, you’re a big guy,” Shez commented, staring up at the largest man she’d ever met. Or maybe the largest boy? He did have an Academy uniform on, after all. And he was staring at her in some confusion, which, right, that was a weird way to introduce herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, Dedue! Uh, sorry to bother you,” Ashe apologized in her stead, before glancing at Shez. “Um, Shez, this is–”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no need to introduce us, I can do that myself!” she interrupted, before grinning up at the big guy. “Hey there, I’m Shez Eisner, also known as the Violet Demon and daughter of Jeralt the Blade Breaker! Also a mercenary up for hire, if you’re interested!” She paused. “Oh, and I guess a student here now, also.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I see,” Dedue responded, mostly because he wasn’t completely sure how to respond to that sudden deluge of information. “It is nice to meet you, Shez. I am Dedue Molinaro. If I may ask, are you the mercenary who rescued his highness?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yeah! Well, my sister and I, but I was the one who mostly stuck by the prince.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then you have my gratitude.” He placed a hand on his chest and gave her a bow, though he did pause at the sudden, seemingly excited noise she made.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah ha, I knew you were someone important! You have that kinda noble look to you, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>He blinked, not expecting that response in the slightest. And vaguely hoping none of the actual nobles of Faerghus just heard this girl compare him to one of them.</p><p> </p><p>“So are you like a duke or something? I think that’s the rank below a king, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I believe you may be confused. I am simply his highness’s retainer. I have no noble blood,” he explained.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, whoops…well are you still rich? Because, again, I am open to being hired if you need a bodyguard.”</p><p> </p><p>Dedue raised an eyebrow at the much shorter and less visibly muscular woman offering to be his bodyguard. “I think I will be fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, true, you do look pretty beefy…oh, hey, how much does being a prince’s retainer pay? Because if that doesn’t work out, we could totally use a big guy like you in our group.”</p><p> </p><p>Dedue wasn’t sure if he should be impressed at just how mercenary this mercenary’s mindset happened to be. “No, thank you, I am loyal to his highness. However, if you ever have need of my strength, I would be happy to repay the debt that is owed for saving his life.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well hey, I won’t turn down free help either!" Shez said, grinning before she decided to look around. "...Huh, hey Ashe, why are we in a greenhouse?" </p><p> </p><p>"...You're the one who led us here." </p><p> </p><p>"And why did you let me do that?" </p><p> </p><p>"I thought you knew where you were going." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh no, I'm terrible with directions, dad refuses to let me be the one with the map,” Shez explained to Ashe’s surprise. "But hey, at least this place is nice. You hang out around here often, Dedue?" </p><p> </p><p>"When I have the time to,” the giant responded, before he glanced at the gardener in charge who kept giving him wary looks. "But I should take my leave for now." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh? Are you heading somewhere? Mind if we tag along?" </p><p> </p><p>"My apologies, but I would not recommend lingering around a man of Duscur, lest rumors spread." </p><p> </p><p>"And that's a bad thing?" Shez asked, raising an eyebrow. "I'm a mercenary, I make my living off of rumors and word of mouth." </p><p> </p><p>"We were planning on meeting the rest of the Blue Lions, Dedue,” Ashe said, “It would only be right if we have her meet everyone together, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Very well, I was going to meet his highness anyways." </p><p> </p><p>"Nice!” Shez grinned. “Now, where are we going?" </p><p> </p><p>"His highness was still in the classroom when I came here. As well as many of our classmates." </p><p> </p><p>"In that case, let's go there! Mind leading the way, Ashe?" </p><p> </p><p>"I don't mind, aha." The young boy said with a smile as he led the way towards the classroom, which was the exact opposite way Shez had gone after leaving the cafeteria. Soon enough the trio arrived at the courtyard that led to the classrooms, a few students still milling about. Though it seemed someone in specific noticed the trio. </p><p> </p><p>"Wow, look at you Ashe, I look away for a bit and here you are with a beautiful girl at your side," a tall redhead said with a smirk. </p><p> </p><p>"I-it's not like that Sylvain!"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh? In that case, if she's single, I'd definitely like to know her." </p><p> </p><p>"You could start by talking to me, you know." Shez said. "Name's Shez if you're wondering."</p><p> </p><p>"Oooh, you're the mercenary Dimitri was talking about. Pleasure to meet you, I'm Sylvain Jose Gautier." </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, guess being buddies with a prince is definitely gonna help my rep." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure it will. In fact, I can already see people lining up to hire you. I certainly wouldn't mind doing so for some one on one time," Sylvain said with a flirtatious wink. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey man, it's your money. But if you're expecting anything, you're better off hiring a prostitute." Sylvain probably wasn't expecting such a crass response since he did a double take. "And if you're wondering how Ashe and I know each other, my dad's company got hired by his dad for a while." </p><p> </p><p>"My siblings really miss you and Byleth by the way,” Ashe mentioned, “I'm sure they'll be happy to hear that you're here next time I get the chance to write to them." </p><p> </p><p>Sylvain, meanwhile, managed to shake off his surprise in favor of some curiosity. "And may I ask who Byleth is?" </p><p> </p><p>"She's my sister, and before you try anything, she only likes girls," Shez warned, getting Sylvain to put his hands up in mock surrender. </p><p> </p><p>"Sylvain, you better not be bothering this girl," a blonde girl said, frowning as she marched up to him. "We already owe her for saving Dimitri. The last thing we need is you giving her  a bad impression of the Blue Lions." </p><p> </p><p>Shez shrugged. "Eh, you guys have been cool so far." </p><p> </p><p>"Regardless, he should know better." Letting out a sigh, she faced Shez before bowing to her. "You may call me Ingrid, and on behalf of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, I thank you for saving Prince Dimitri."</p><p> </p><p>"You must be quite skilled if he needed your help. I look forward to beating you in a spar," a sharp-eyed, black haired boy said, as he stared Shez down. Or, well, tried to.</p><p> </p><p>"Felix, don't be rude!" </p><p> </p><p>"And if you're looking for a spar, you'll have to wait. The Black Eagles are using it right now, apparently the house leader challenged someone to a spar." Sylvain explained, getting Ingrid to frown and Shez to look thoughtful. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, wonder if that's where Edelgard took my sister." </p><p> </p><p>"Shez, was it?" Ingrid asked, getting the mercenary in question to nod. "You and your sister probably shouldn't be hanging around the people of the Empire, they're dangerous." </p><p> </p><p>"Really?" Shez asked, a bit amused. "Well, even if they are, not like it matters. None of you kids could touch us in a fight if we were being serious." </p><p> </p><p>"Is that so?" Felix asked, apparently taking that as a challenge. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, the only one who can beat By is me, and By is the only one who can beat me!" </p><p> </p><p>"Neither of you have bested your father," Arval pointed out, which did get Shez to pause. Which, well…that was different, dad was dad, which she would point out to Arval if they weren’t in public.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. Are you willing to test that?” Felix asked, still trying to stare her down.</p><p> </p><p>And Shez met his glare with an eager grin. “Anytime you want to, I’m willing.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Felix regarded her for a moment, then smirked, clearly looking forward to it. Up until Sylvain opened his mouth again.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, look at that! Felix got his first date! I’m so proud!”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up, Sylvain! Would it kill you to think with your head instead of your–”</p><p> </p><p>“Felix!” Ingrid cut him off, looking scandalized and prompting a laugh from Shez.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, you guys are pretty fun. Is this everybody?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, no, there’s actually two more girls,” Ashe answered, “Mercedes and Annette, who should be…somewhere around here, I think. Oh, and his highness, of course. And a few other students.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well alright, let’s go find them! C’mon Ashe, you’re my guide.”</p><p> </p><p>“H-Huh? Oh, uh, alright–W-Woah, slow down!” he tried to request as Shez grabbed him by the wrist and started dragging him off, much to Sylvain’s amusement.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, they grow up so fast.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Who are you referring to?” Dimitri asked curiously as he came over to the gathered group.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm…would it be funnier to tell you, or leave it a secret?”</p><p> </p><p>Ingrid and Felix just sighed before getting back to what they were doing, leaving Dimitri’s question unanswered and the blond prince increasingly confused.</p><hr /><p>“And here we have the gardens,” Edelgard stated as she continued showing her future professor around the Academy’s grounds, “Specifically, these are the outdoor gardens many students will gather in for leisure during their free time. It is not unusual to see tea parties hosted at the tables set out here–”</p><p> </p><p>“Is that Shez?” Byleth interrupted, catching the princess off guard. Partially because her professor had been content to let her talk up until this point, but also because the younger Eisner sister was indeed sitting at one of the tea tables alongside some students she recognized as being from the Blue Lions.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm~! Oh wow, this is good–Ah hey By!” And it seemed she noticed the two of them as well, as she suddenly sat up and began waving at her sister. “Hey, come join us! And bring the princess too!”</p><p> </p><p>"Okay?" Without another word, Byleth walked off, heading to the table expecting Edelgard to follow. Which… there was a slight chance she might be convinced to join a different class, so best not leave her alone with the Blue Lions. "Hm? Is that you Ash–mh?" </p><p> </p><p>"Tastes great, doesn't it?" Shez asked after cutting off her sister by shoving a tart into her mouth. "Apparently we can just have these whenever!" She smiled brightly, ignoring the stare her sister was giving her, which slowly went away as she ate the tart, her faintly annoyed expression fading as she tasted the pastry.</p><p> </p><p>"Well not whenever, but we don't mind if you wanna join us for our tea parties whenever Mercedes and I make some treats, right?" Annette asked as she looked at her companion. </p><p> </p><p>"The more the merrier," the older Blue Lions member said with a gentle smile.</p><p> </p><p>"...Can I have another?" Byleth asked, staring at the plate of treats. </p><p> </p><p>"Go ahead," Mercedes allowed, before looking at Edelgard as Byleth grabbed another tart to eat. "What about you, Edelgard, would you like one?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I would hate to impose."</p><p> </p><p>"Nonsense, if anything you're helping us. We're not going to be able to finish this off ourselves, and I would hate for them to grow stale." </p><p> </p><p>"...Well if you insist." The treats did look rather delicious, and Edelgard did her best to school her features as she bit into one. “...”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard took a seat at the tea table.</p><p> </p><p>“So what’ve you been up to, By?” Shez asked, “I heard something about a spar out at the training ground.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I sparred with Edelgard,” Byleth answered, inclining her head towards Edelgard before pausing as Mercedes poured her a cup of tea. “Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re very welcome,” the older blonde said with a smile, before giving her a curious look, “Miss Byleth, was it?” At her nod, she continued. “Your sister was telling us that you are going to be a professor here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, have you picked out a class yet?” Annette asked, also curious. Edelgard decided not to speak up, wagering that the professor might be bothered if she were interrupted, and her wager paid off as the woman nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m probably going to be teaching the Black Eagles. I already trained with Edelgard and the rest of her class seems nice.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, dang, I guess Edelgard got to you before we could then,” the redhead commented with a little grin, “It would have been fun having twins join our class, even if one would be the professor.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard raised an eyebrow at the mention of twins, remembering Shez’s earlier claims, before simply shaking her head and accepting an offered cup of tea from Mercedes. The conversation moved along to how the two sisters knew Ashe, who seemed curiously flustered at being the only boy at the table, and Edelgard listened with some interest as they talked about their brief time in the kingdom.</p><p> </p><p>“I really thought I would be able to handle the cold better since the mountains I came from could get pretty cold and snowy in the winter, but it was completely different,” Shez commented.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, winters in Faerghus do tend to be remarkably harsh,” Mercedes agreed, “I was originally from Adrestia, so the cold can still catch me off guard sometimes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh hey, that’s neat. We spent a lot of time in the Empire, though dad’s actually from Faerghus.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh really? Heh, I guess you didn’t inherit our ‘cold blood’ then,” Annette said, “So where are you two from if you weren’t born in Faerghus?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m from the Alliance, actually! Ordelia territory specifically, I think. Right, By?” she asked, glancing at her sister, who nodded but didn’t add anything in favor of taking another tart. It seemed the new professor had something of a sweet tooth.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard also happened to notice Shez answered in the singular there. Not unexpected given that she admitted to being adopted, but it was interesting that she was also attempting to pretend she and Byleth were twins. Looking at the two of them…Edelgard was fairly certain Byleth was indeed the elder of the two, while Shez was likely closer to Edelgard’s age than her sister’s despite being taller. Byleth simply looked more mature between the two of them, so it raised the question of why Shez was attempting such an easily seen through deception…</p><p> </p><p>"There you two are, I've been looking everywhere for you!" A voice shook her out of her thoughts as Claude came up to the small party. "Here I was waiting for my new friends to come visit, only to find out you went to have a tea party,” Claude said with mock offense.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh sorry your grace, I guess I lost track of the time while having fun," Shez mockingly replied with a smile. </p><p> </p><p>"Well if you're really sorry, you can make it up to us, isn't that right Hilda?" Claude asked his pink-haired companion who seemed to have been dragged along with him. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah totally! I'm sure there's plenty a pair of big, strong mercs like you two can do to make it up to us," Hilda said, buttering up the two mercenaries as she's wont to do. </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, too little, too late, Claude, both of them have already chosen what class they're going to join," Annette said with a smug smile. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah but you forgot! Transferring between classes is allowed for students, so who knows, we might end up stealing Shez away." Claude glanced at Byleth. “Not sure if we can steal a professor too, but hey, I’m willing to give it a try.”</p><p> </p><p>"Transferring?" Byleth asked, not bothering to wipe the crumbs away from her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>"Students are allowed to transfer between classes should they wish, this mainly happens should one wish to learn under a different professor," Edelgard explained</p><p> </p><p>"Or if they want to try and get close to someone from a different class. After all, with the right connections you can do anything," Claude added, "As such, it's only fair you let these two meet my class, don't you think?" </p><p> </p><p>"Just don't come crying to me when your classmates wish to transfer over to the Black Eagles," Edelgard said, deciding to not try and force Byleth to stay. </p><p> </p><p>"Eh, if you want I'll toss Lorenz your way," Claude said as Byleth and Shez got up, though the former was stopped as Edelgard pulled out her handkerchief. </p><p> </p><p>"Professor, you have crumbs around your mouth," she said, handing her the handkerchief. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, thank you." Taking it, she cleaned the crumbs off, before pocketing the item. </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, professor, you're not supposed to keep that…" Annette said a bit surprised to see her do so. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not?" </p><p> </p><p>"It's fine, just please return it later," Edelgard allowed, waving them off as she reached for another treat. </p><p> </p><p>"So, I know you two were just having a tea party, but are you feeling hungry? No better way to get to know someone than over a nice meal," Claude asked as he led them to the mess hall. </p><p> </p><p>"I already ate earlier, but I don't think By has." </p><p> </p><p>"You're in for a treat, professor! The classes here might be a drag but the delicious food helps make up for it," Hilda said with a smile. "Getting to try food from all over is great!" </p><p> </p><p>“That it is, a perfect place for a feast whenever the need arises,” Claude agreed, before looking at the sisters. “And what's a feast without companions? A rather sad one if you ask me, hence why the Golden Deer are here if you want to join.” </p><p> </p><p>“There you are, Claude. I was starting to wonder if you were even going to return,” a rather posh sounding guy said as he walked up to the group. “If you’re not even going to attend a party you plan, then I wonder how well you’ll be able to lead.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well I needed to get our guests of honor,” Claude replied, gesturing at the said guests. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, my apologies, I didn't see you there. I presume you two are the mercenaries who saved Claude? On behalf of the alliance I, Lorenz Hellman Gloucester, apologize for the trouble he might have dragged you into.” </p><p> </p><p>“Gloucester?” Shez blinked, then grinned, “Oh, hey, are you the count’s kid?” </p><p> </p><p>“I am the son of Count Gloucester, yes. Why do you ask?”</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve worked for you dad a couple times! The first job By and I were on was one he hired us for.” </p><p> </p><p>“Is that so? Well it seems my father’s eye for talent continues to stay true if you truly are so skilled. If I may ask, what work have you done for him?”</p><p> </p><p>“Helping my village for one,” a familiar orange-haired gal said as she walked up to them. “Hey there Shez, Byleth. How’s the captain doing?” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh hey Leonie!” Shez greeted with a grin, “Dad’s doing fine! Well, less good now that he’s around here. I don’t think he likes…Well, I think he has a few bad memories that this place is bringing back.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? Huh. I heard he was the former knight’s captain, so I guess it might have something to do with that...”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you are the daughters of Jeralt the Blade Breaker then,” Lorenz realized, “Yes, that does make sense. I must say, your father has a well-earned reputation for reliability.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not to interrupt all this interesting talk of mercenary lineages,” Claude interrupted with far less shame than he was pretending to have, “But we still need to introduce the new girls to everybody, right? After all, I can’t properly poach you two if you don’t know everyone.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha! Well if you insist on showing me around, your grace, go for it!” Shez said, “Just know I’m the type of girl to keep to a contract, so you’ll have to be pretty convincing if you want me to switch over.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I won’t say no to a challenge! Come on, let’s show you around!”</p><p> </p><p>As Claude and Shez headed to chat with the other Golden Deer around, Lorenz let out an aggrieved sigh. “I have no idea how he thinks he can lead the Alliance when he’s so willing to traipse off on whatever venture catches his interest.”</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, come on Lorenz, Claude’s not that bad,” Hilda replied, prompting an amused noise from Leonie.</p><p> </p><p>“So if he’s not so bad, why are you hanging back with the rest of us instead of joining the tour?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well maybe I would prefer to get to know the older sister, huh? Byleth, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“My name is Byleth, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, you’re really monotone. How did that happen when your sister’s so lively?” Hilda asked, before laughing a little at herself, “Though I guess I’m one to talk, considering how different me and Holst are.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah yes, and how is your brother, Hilda?” Lorenz inquired, turning his attention to the most noble of the women gathered near him.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, uh, good, I guess? I mean, it’s not like I send him letters everyday, so I’m not going to know immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? Why not? I would expect you to be more dutiful in keeping up contact with the future lord of your house.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, looks like they’re talking about noble stuff now.” Leonie sighed, before grinning at Byleth. “So, while they chat about pedigrees or whatever, care to share what you’ve been up to since I saw you in Sauin?”</p><p> </p><p>“A few things,” Byleth answered.</p><p> </p><p>“...You’re about the same as ever, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>She shrugged, her attention more on Claude and Shez as the former introduced the latter to the rest of the Golden Deer. Aside from Hilda, Lorenz, and Leonie, there seemed to be two more boys sitting together who contrasted heavily with one another, and two girls sitting more away from the rest of the group.</p><p> </p><p>“Starting things off, here’s Raphael Kirsten and Ignatz Victor, two bonafide knights-in-training,” Claude explained as he gestured to the two boys in question, a large, extremely muscular blond and a short, skinny boy with glasses and olive-green hair. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey there!”</p><p> </p><p>“H-Hello! Ah, are you one of the mercenaries that rescued Claude?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey now, I didn’t need rescue,” Claude complained, prompting a smirk from Shez.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh really, your grace? So those bandits were just trying to hunt you down to have a tea party?”</p><p> </p><p>“I sure hope not, otherwise the fact you cut straight through most of them is going to be really awkward to explain to the knights.”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh, you’d be surprised. Anyway, so Raphael Kirsten and Ignatz Victor, right? That’s kind of funny, we have a Victor back in our company.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, really?” Ignatz asked, a little curious.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah but it’s his given name, not his family name, so I’m pretty sure you two aren’t related. Especially since he’s from the Empire and closer to Raphael here in height and build.”</p><p> </p><p>That caught Raphael’s attention. “Seriously? Wow, I didn’t think I’d run into someone dedicated to building muscle like I am this quick! Can I meet him?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sure, though he’s definitely not as bulky as you are. Kind of more on the hefty side these days, though don’t let that fool you, he’s still really solid.”</p><p> </p><p>While that conversation continued, Byleth nudged Leonie and pointed to the quiet, blue-haired girl eating on her own and the short, white-haired girl reading a book at the dining table. “Who are those two?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Oh, the girl with the blue hair is Marianne. She’s Margrave Edmund’s daughter, from that northern house. I think she might be shy, she doesn’t really interact with people unless she has to. And that’s Lysithea with the book. She’s some type of magic prodigy despite being one of the younger students. She’s alright, but she gets snippy if you bring up her age.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth nodded to that information, then paused, noticing another girl who seemed deeply nervous just to be in the mess hall. The short, purple-haired girl was staring at the menu like it was going to launch itself at her if she made the wrong move, when she wasn’t looking all around herself as though expecting an ambush. “Do you know her too?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…not really, no. I think that’s…Bernadette, I think, from the Black Eagles.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you mean Bernadetta?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, that was it.” Leonie shrugged. “Like I said, I don’t really know her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…Thank you for the information.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Didn't expect you to actually thank me–And she’s walking off, okay…”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth walked over to the small, shaky girl. “Hello.”</p><p> </p><p>“AH!” She wasn’t expecting her to immediately scream. “A-A-A-Ah, s-s-s-sorry! Sorry, I-I’ll get out of your way, I’m sorry, don’t kill me!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not planning to kill you. Are you Bernadetta?”</p><p> </p><p>“AH!? H-How do you know my name?! A-A-Are you an assassin!?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m a mercenary. Or a professor now, I guess,” Byleth answered as she regarded the plainly terrified girl. She wasn’t sure exactly what she was doing wrong, but it wasn’t a pleasant feeling. “I heard you ran away from the training yard when everyone else in your class was gathering there. I’m going to be your professor going forward, so–”</p><p> </p><p>“AAH!?! Y-YOU ARE!? Aaahh, then I made you mad because I ran away and you’re going to execute me in front of everyone as a lesson!?!”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth felt a flicker of actual concern. “No, I’m not. Are you–”</p><p> </p><p>And then the other girl promptly sprinted in the opposite direction, screaming out, “PLEASE DON’T KILL ME!” as she went.</p><p> </p><p>“...Hm.” </p><p> </p><p>“Wow. What did you say to her?” Leonie asked as she walked up to Byleth.</p><p> </p><p>“...I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>Maybe this teaching job would be harder than she considered…</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Captain, there you are!" Pausing in his conversation with Alois, Jeralt looked over his shoulder to see Leonie waving at him as she ran up. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Leonie, I didn't know you were here," Jeralt said, a bit surprised to see the young hunter. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my, did I forget to mention?" Alois asked. "Yes, your apprentice is a member of the Golden Deer. I guess you could say she's your <em> deer </em>apprentice." </p><p> </p><p>"...So how have you been Leonie?" Jeralt asked, moving the conversation along. </p><p> </p><p>"I've been doing great! Alois has been telling me all sorts of stories about you!" </p><p> </p><p>"He has huh?" he asked, glancing at his former squire. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah yes, Leonie here was quite excited to find out I used to work with you, so she has constantly been asking me about stories involving you. <em> Constantly </em>. Ah, though I promise you I've said nothing but the best." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah! I didn't know you were a knight captain! You're even greater than I thought!" </p><p> </p><p>"It's not that impressive," Jeralt muttered, before he noticed the charm around Leonie's neck. "You kept that old thing?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, yeah? Why wouldn't I? It was a good luck charm from you!" Leonie said, holding the charm. "In fact, I kept all those gifts you guys got me!" </p><p> </p><p>"Really?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah! I mean, the training weight is a bit too small now, but it's still handy when I want to weigh something down!" Leonie said, before giving a sheepish smile. "Funny enough, the knife Byleth gave me was also really useful, since the one I had ended up breaking a week later." </p><p> </p><p>“Heh. Well I’m sure she’ll be happy to hear you got some use out of her gift." </p><p> </p><p>"Well…maybe. Ah, but, how have things been for you Captain? I'm sure you have plenty of stories to tell!" </p><p> </p><p>"Nothing that glamorous," Jeralt said, letting out a small sigh. "I'm sure the kids can probably tell you more than I can." </p><p> </p><p>"Well sure, but I want to hear from you!" </p><p> </p><p>"Is that so…? Well, the kids have gotten much stronger. Shez is still as reckless as ever, but she has the skills to back it up now," Jeralt said, as he began to reminisce. "Her and Byleth actually started taking missions on their own some years back." </p><p> </p><p>"They did?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I still make sure it's nothing that dangerous, but they've been doing good. Though if you were to listen to Shez, she'd act like they were all world-ending threats." </p><p> </p><p>"Aha, nothing wrong with exaggerating a tale when you're retale-ing them," Alois said with a grin. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…Byleth is the opposite of Shez as usual," Jeralt continued, not acknowledging the pun. "She's got a good head for when it comes to tactics, and is even preparing to take over for me if I ever retire." </p><p> </p><p>"...Really?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I think it's mainly cause Shez is pushing her towards it," Jeralt explained. "She's good at it, at least. I'm not planning on retiring any time soon, but if I ever did, I know the group would be in good hands." </p><p> </p><p>"...Hm." Leonie couldn't help but frown a bit. She always knew there was a chance one of the two sisters would take over the captain’s mercenary band; they were the captain’s daughters, so it was to be expected they'd probably end up leading. That being said, a part of her couldn't help but feel a bit…annoyed at the idea of that arrogant merc being in charge. </p><p> </p><p>"You know, since I used to be your right-hand man, I wonder if that makes Byleth my junior if she really will be taking over for you," Alois considered, mirth evident in his voice. </p><p> </p><p>"Pretty sure she could teach you a thing or two, Alois–" </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry about leaving so quickly, Captain! There's just something I need to check!" Leonie suddenly spoke up, catching Jeralt off guard as she sprinted away. </p><p> </p><p>"Huh, wonder what came up…"</p><hr /><p>Dashing through the monastery, Leonie looked around, trying to find any sight of the sisters as she did. They had apparently already taken off from the feast, though it was a bit too early for them to be asleep. </p><p> </p><p>She didn't expect to find them with Byleth pinned down on the ground by cats and dogs while Shez laughed at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>"Seems you got quite the fanclub, By," Shez teased, crouching down as she reached for one of the cats, only to yank her hand back as it scratched her. "Ow." </p><p> </p><p>"Don't be rude,” Byleth said to the cat in question, giving it small scritches under its chin. </p><p> </p><p>"...I see you two have met the monastery pets," Leonie muttered, not sure what else to say. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, they're not a bunch of wild animals?" Shez asked. </p><p> </p><p>"No, the monastery keeps them since they help chase away rats and such." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh, well that's neat," Shez said as Byleth continued petting the various animals cuddling up to her. Shaking her head, Leonie regained her focus. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Byleth, I want to spar!" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, sure." Grabbing the cat that was resting on her head, Byleth gently set them down, before gingerly stepping around the animals. "To the training grounds?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah!" </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, don't think I'll be staying out of this!" Shez shouted, following behind the two as they went off. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, sorry Shez, I want to spar with Byleth first," Leonie apologized, keeping her eye on Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"Is ‘first to three strikes’ okay?" Byleth asked, grabbing a wooden sword as they arrived.</p><p> </p><p>"Nope, I want to go until one of us yields!" Leonie stated, getting Byleth to pause for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>"...Okay, let's just make sure to be careful,” she cautioned, though she wasn’t bothering to put on a helmet or any training armor, which prompted a frown from Leonie.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you that sure you’re not gonna get hit here?” the redhead asked as she grabbed a training spear for herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? It’s just a spar,” Byleth said with a shrug. Her eyes lingered on the padded wooden spear in Leonie’s grip, then she nodded to herself. “Alright. Shez, can you give a count?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sure! Three!” The two young women faced each other. “Two!” They readied their weapons. “One!” And then they charged in, Leonie thrusting her spear straight for Byleth’s face in a move that would have done a lot of damage in a real fight. </p><p> </p><p>She made sure not to overextend herself too so she could pull her sword back when the first thrust missed–Then Byleth clotheslined her, smashing the younger commoner straight off her feet and sending her crashing to the ground. “Gh–!”</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, that was a hard hit,” Shez commented, impressed, “You’re actually taking this seriously, By?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…I am, yeah,” Byleth agreed, frowning for a moment at the winded redhead on the ground, before she relaxed as Leonie pushed herself back up, shaking herself out.</p><p> </p><p>“Phew…I didn’t yield,” she stated, readjusting her grip and narrowing her eyes towards Byleth, who nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“I know. Ready?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ready!”</p><hr /><p>Some time later, Leonie felt…frustrated. Very frustrated. In large part because she was on her back again, this time after Byleth hooked her ankle with her foot while shoving her back.</p><p> </p><p>She’d tried to catch the arrogant merc’s wrist but that just got Byleth to deliberately fall with her and now Leonie’s ribs were aching from the elbow the captain’s daughter drove into her sternum.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay?” Byleth asked from where she was sitting on the ground beside her.</p><p> </p><p>“…’m good,” Leonie grumbled. Well, half-grumbled, half-wheezed.</p><p> </p><p>“Mm. Throwing dirt in my eyes was a decent move,” she complimented, though Leonie just huffed in reply.</p><p> </p><p>“You still kicked my ass that time.” She couldn’t deny that, especially after Byleth fully slammed her into the dirt.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm.” </p><p> </p><p>Leonie let out a little aggrieved sigh. She knew the captain’s daughter had more experience than her and the idea she’d be even stronger than the last time they met seemed obvious, but it still stung at her pride to be on the consistent losing side.</p><p> </p><p>"You've gotten stronger." Byleth noted, as she got up. "You'll make it far as a mercenary." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh?" Looking up at the mercenary, Leonie saw her extend a hand towards her. </p><p> </p><p>"Guess that means you'll be joining the team once you graduate," Byleth said, matter of factly.</p><p> </p><p>"I-I will?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, unless you didn't want to," Byleth said with a frown. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course she wants to!" Shez butted in, slinging a hand over Byleth’s shoulder. "Though, you gotta get your own rival, got it? By's my rival!" </p><p> </p><p>Leonie blinked, then snorted, giggling. “Alright, I won’t steal your rival, Shez. Though do you have anyone you’d recommend me going up against instead?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…good question…”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe you could be her rival,” Byleth suggested.</p><p> </p><p>“Me? Well I guess I could–Wait, no, that’s not how it works! You can only have one rival!”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s just how it works! It’s like…a law of, uh…writing or something!”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s never been a protagonist that has more than one rival?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Uh…hm. That’s a good question…” She tilted her head, before shrugging. “Yeah, alright, do you want to be my rival, Leonie?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Sure? So…can Byleth also be my rival or is that not allowed?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not allowed,” Shez decisively stated. And that was that.</p>

  <span>Jeralt didn’t really know what to make of his new, old office. It was…bizarre, being back at the monastery, and finding things both had and hadn’t changed as much as he expected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, that was something he could focus on later. For now, he was just glad conversations in his office weren't easy to listen in on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you had a dream of a strange person too, but yours is a girl with green hair instead of Shez’s weird white person,” he began, his attention focused on Byleth for the moment, though Shez looked like she wanted to chime in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you get cool powers too??" Shez asked, leaning in closer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, she was able to turn back time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...what?" Jeralt asked, his eyes widening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"During the fight, I wasn't able to block an attack, but she stopped time and then turned it back, which gave me another chance to defeat the leader," Byleth explained, thinking back on what happened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...that sounds so much cooler than what I can do.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me?" Arval asked, some genuine offense in their voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know what I mean, Arval! Your stuff is cool too, but can it do something like this?" Grabbing a book off their dad's desk, Shez tossed it at Byleth, fully expecting her to grab it with her time powers. Only for it to end up hitting her straight in the face. "..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I did say she was the one turning back time, right?" Byleth asked, rubbing her forehead, "I don't think she will unless it'll be a serious injury." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, what good are these so-called time powers if she herself cannot use them at will?" Arval mocked, feeling quite smug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt, meanwhile, couldn't help but wonder just what exactly this meant. As far as he was aware, Sitri wasn't able to do these things. Was it something Rhea had done? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had apparently awakened them that night which… it was too strong of a coincidence for it to not involve the archbishop. Just what was she planning…?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, is that girl here?" Shez asked, looking around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, she's asleep," Byleth said as she shook her head. "I think she likes to sleep a lot." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, so her partner cannot even bother being out and about to help, hm?” Arval continued to sound very smug. “Just goes to show how much better I am as your partner, Shez." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There's another thing I wanted to mention," Byleth said, getting their attention. "During the bandit attack, the leader said something weird. About how he shouldn't have 'listened to that idiot'." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And what does that mean?" Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They might have been hired to attack the students," Byleth said before explaining her thoughts. "While it is possible that it's just a coincidence, it's odd these bandits just so happened to be there when they were training. Even more so that they attacked even with the knights there."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But they're dead now, so what does it matter?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That doesn’t get rid of whoever hired them." Jeralt said, thinking over what Byleth said. "I'm sure these brats are used to people coming after them, but someone willing to take out the three heirs of the nation and possibly anger the church in the process isn't someone we can just ignore." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So what, you gonna try and find stuff out?" Shez asked, quirking an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll try, but not sure how much we'll find out with the bandits gone." Jeralt said with a sigh. "For now, we should go and meet the Archbishop. I doubt Seteth will be happy with us if we make them wait." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, right, time to officially join the classes," Shez muttered as they got up. "Heh, hope you're not going to be lonely without me Byleth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's only for the year," Byleth said, before smiling. "Besides, we'll still have each other's backs in case anything bad happens." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You got that right, though feel free to come crying to me for help if you can't handle your class." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Same for you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Letting out an amused huff at their back and forth, Jeralt led the two to the audience chamber where Rhea and Seteth were waiting for them, as well as the two other professors.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hello there, I hope you have been enjoying your time here," Rhea greeted them as they walked in. "I've heard you've gotten close to all three houses." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Speaking of," Seteth spoke up before anyone else could respond. "While I am personally against it, it's time for you to choose which house you'll be leading. Normally this would be discussed between the professors, but it seems your colleagues are allowing you to choose which class you want."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You are new here, so Manuela and I decided allowing you to do this would help make you feel more at ease," Hanneman said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Though we're more than happy to assist you should the need arise," Manuela added. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded to both of them. "In that case, I would like to teach the Black Eagles." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so?" Rhea asked with a smile. "Well, it seems the goddess has decided to bless the Black Eagles with two strong-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, actually," Shez spoke up, cutting Rhea off and getting Seteth to frown at her, "I was hoping to join the Blue Lions." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I would ask that you not interrupt the Archbishop again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's okay, Seteth," Rhea said, trying to calm him down, "May I ask why you wish to be in a different class, child?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, it just seems funner this way. Besides, I can always just transfer over if things don't go well, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I suppose if that is what you wish, though I am surprised you did not choose to stay with a member of your family.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it that surprising? I figure it’ll be better to branch out, right?” Shez grinned. “Besides, I hear the Eagle house and the Lion house are natural rivals, so it’s perfect for me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea didn’t seem to know what to make of that while Seteth sighed, looking annoyed. “None of the houses are ‘natural rivals’. They are each equal in their standing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah but one’s red and one’s blue and those are opposing colors. Isn’t that the whole reason the Kingdom chose blue to be it’s color? So they could be the opposite of the Empire?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is a fascinating question that I am sure will be answered in your lessons, child,” Rhea said, deciding to wrap things up. “Though I will mention the color of the Black Eagles is black.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah…wait, why’s the princess wearing red then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was good speaking with all of you,” Rhea continued, completely ignoring Shez, “May the Goddess's light continue to shine down on all of you forevermore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...She didn’t answer my question,” Shez complained after Rhea left with Seteth in tow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The colors of the Empire are black and red, so, despite the name, it is traditional for the leader of the Black Eagles to wear a red cape instead of a black one,” Hanneman decided to explain, “It helps the house leader stand out properly due to the standard uniform of Garreg Mach being primarily black.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ohhh, that makes sense. Thanks!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hanneman smiled, his mustache curling slightly with it. “You’re very welcome. It is only right for me to aid you, given you are joining the house I plan to teach now that Professor Byleth has made her selection. Ah, speaking of, given that the archbishop and her chamberlain have left earlier than I expected, I believe that leaves it up to me to mention the upcoming Mock Battle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mock Battle?” Byleth repeated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed! It is traditional that in the first month of the Academy’s school year that the professors and students take to the field in one large battle, to test the students’ capabilities and get them used to combat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not as big of a spectacle as we’ll be seeing later in the year with the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, but it’s a good rehearsal for the new students,” Manuela added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed it is, and I will note that I seem to have gained quite the advantage this year with our newest student,” Hanneman noted with amusement, “How long have you been a mercenary, Miss Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm…officially, I guess five or six years since dad didn’t want us fighting immediately,” she explained, considering if she should mention her previous mercenary experience and deciding not to. It’s not that she didn’t like the professors, but her dad was still wary of this place and she didn’t want to give away too much…which she probably should’ve thought of before mentioning important stuff like being adopted to the house leaders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh so you realized that on your own,” Arval noticed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Manuela frowned at that information. “While I won’t get into what I think about your previous career, especially one you participated in at such a young age, I will point out that is a pretty big advantage you have over the other students, most of whom haven’t experienced combat at all before the mock battle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hanneman huffed, crossing his arms over his chest. “I can see what you’re doing, Manuela. You’re just trying to take away the advantage my class has.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t you do the same in my situation? Still, I do think it might be better for you to sit this battle out, Shez. Like Hanneman said, we’re trying to get the students used to combat, and we can’t very well do that if you completely dominate the field.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph, using my own words against me now, I see how it is…” Hanneman grumbled, before sighing, “Unfortunately, I may have to agree with Manuela here. Though I will point out that Shez is not the only one of our students to have seen combat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, so, hold on, am I not doing this mock battle thing?” Shez asked, genuinely confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It appears that will be the case, though I do plan to further discuss this matter with my fellow professors.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…hm.” Shez wasn’t completely sure how to react to being declared too strong to join in a battle with the other students. On the one hand, it was pretty disappointing. On the other, she did like having her strength acknowledged, though… “Wait, hang on, why’s Byleth joining in then? She’s also a merc.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The professors’ role in the mock battle is more to be supervisors and field commanders. While defeating a professor does remove the House they belong to from the battle, at least as far as scoring is considered, that factor is mainly there as incentive for the students to consider strategy and defensive tactics instead of simply charging one another and getting into a brawl.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so she’s like a client they’re supposed to protect?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Precisely. She may give instructions and aid where necessary, but this battle is about the students, not the teachers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s really the case for both of the school battles, but I’m sure everyone will be at a more even level for the second one,” Manuela added, “So there’s no issue with you joining in then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh…okay, I guess,” Shez conceded, shrugging.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great! Now that that’s decided, would you two mind coming with me?” Manuela asked the two sisters, “I really should give you two a physical sooner rather than later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, before that, I was actually wondering if you two would consider joining me in my office instead,” Hanneman said, “I have in my possession a device for analyzing potential crests an individual may have, and I would be quite interested in seeing if the two of you possess crests yourself. Your father does have one, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt, who had been watching all of this without jumping in, mainly because he wasn’t a teacher and didn’t really feel like it, glanced up at being mentioned. “Ah, yeah, a crest of Seiros. I think it's a minor one, probably.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I would be happy to check for you, if you are interested.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not really.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Disappointing, but not unexpected.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Manuela sighed. “Fine, play around with your toy. Just have these two see me afterward.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes yes, of course. Now then, shall we?”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“How fascinating!” Hanneman exclaimed, staring in clear interest at the strange, not fully there symbol his thingamabob produced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez had no idea what any of this crest research stuff meant, so she wasn’t really sure why a weird shape was fascinating. She did know, since she went first, that she apparently didn’t have a crest. Which was…kind of weird? Because she had Arval, but they weren’t a crest thing, apparently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth did have one though, even if it was a weird wibbly thing that Hanneman didn’t understand, though it wasn’t long before he was muttering about a potentially undiscovered crest and getting really into the idea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I doubt he’ll have much more to say to you at this point,” Arval pointed out, “That is the frenzy of a scholar with a new discovery. It’s not something you can break through easily.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So, uh, professor? I think me and By should get going now, right?” Shez asked, glancing at her sister, who shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, yes, of course, Manuela’s request. Yes yes, go on ahead, though I do hope you wouldn’t mind coming back later, Professor Byleth. Perhaps I could get a clearer image with more readings…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Byleth replied, not really caring either way before she turned to leave with Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for Shez herself, she still wasn’t completely sure how to feel here. Sure, she knew her sister was strong and great, but it was a weird feeling having it confirmed that she just had something inherent that meant she would be better than Shez. Though, Shez did still have Arval, who was completely unique, so it wasn’t like she didn’t have something special too. It was still a strange feeling though.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Byleth nudged her, taking her out of her thoughts. “Eh? Oh, what’s up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were thinking a lot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I can do that, it’s not unusual.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is for you.” It was as faint as always, but there was enough of a hint of humor in Byleth’s voice that Shez wound up smiling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh like you’re the big thinker here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Between the two of us, yeah. You always go charging ahead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Only because I’m good at it! I’m built tough!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re built fast. That’s not the same thing as tough. Remember when you tried on that heavy armor Victor found?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I was getting better with that stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you weren’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could’ve! I just need more practice with it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You want to practice with heavy armor? I did see some knights wearing some. Maybe we could ask.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...It’s not fair when you call my bluffs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t bluff badly then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The two bantered some more, Shez’s mood improving along the way, before they reached the infirmary and it was time for their check-up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So is this one of those things where we undress or what?” Shez asked as she sat on one of the infirmary beds, idly swinging her legs while Manuela checked out Byleth. It was a reasonable question in her mind considering her sister was already down to her top and shorts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you want, though I would prefer it if you at least kept your underwear on. We wouldn’t want there to be any scandalous rumors about teacher/student relationships, now would we~?” Manuela teased, before returning her attention to Byleth. “Now then, you two have lived in a mercenary band for most of your lives, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“All my life,” Byleth admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, I did notice you two seem to make very singular statements about your lived experiences despite being ‘twins’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh, yeah, we should probably explain that,” Shez said in the middle of undoing the armored bits of her outfit. “Uh…great, it’s getting hard to keep track of what I said to who…well, anyway, the basic thing is that I’m actually adopted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahh, that does explain quite a bit, like the fact that a supposed twin is clearly years younger than her sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused. “Years younger? Wait, how many years?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” Manuela glanced over at her, before looking back at Byleth, considering the two of them. “Well…if I had to hazard a guess, I would say Byleth is in her early twenties, while you seem to be closer to the house leaders in age. So…maybe seventeen or eighteen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Manuela wasn’t expecting Shez to abruptly drop backwards onto the infirmary bed with a soft *fwump*. “...Shez? Are you alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So she’s at least two years younger than me?” Byleth asked, and if Shez wasn’t busy staring up at the ceiling in utter defeat, she would’ve been very surprised to see the amused grin currently on Byleth’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Manuela didn’t know her that well yet, so the grin wasn’t shocking to her, though she was a little amused to see the elder Eisner’s stoicism break so readily. “I’m guessing you don’t know for sure how old she is?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope. Shez has always insisted she’s my age or older. It’s good to confirm she really is my </span>
  <em>
    <span>little</span>
  </em>
  <span> sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez groaned. “This is the worst day of my life…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re ridiculous, you know that?” Arval asked, equally rhetorical and mocking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, as I said, it's just a guess,” Manuela said as she brought out a notepad. "But for now, let's begin the examination, shall we?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph." Shez at least sat up, even if she still kept an exaggerated pout on her face as Manuela examined her first. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, well, you certainly are quite healthy," Manuela said while she seemed to be casting a spell to examine Shez. "You do seem to have a nasty scar but it doesn't seem to have left any damage on your lungs. Whoever healed you must have been quite skilled." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Gertrude is the healer of the group! Yeah, she's pretty great!" Shez said, keeping it a secret that Arval was the one who had apparently healed her after she awakened their powers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so? Well I'll have to make sure to ask her if we can swap advice when I have the chance," Manuela commented, before pulling out a stethoscope and placing it against Shez’s back. "Breathe in deeply for me." And as she did, Manuela nodded. "Good, everything seems in order, you get my seal of approval to attend the academy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Would I have not been able to join if I didn't?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I can't really make you leave, but as a physician I definitely would prefer not to send a student with a serious health condition out into combat," Manuela explained, before muttering to herself, "Not that any noble would listen to me if I told them not to let their children join." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is everything okay with the students?" Byleth asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, as a physician I can't divulge any personal information. What I can say is I hope you can keep your students safe," Manuela said, before moving over to Byleth. "Including any who switch to your class from the others, and I promise you I'll make sure to take care of any of yours if they want to swap over." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course," Byleth responded, making Manuela smile as she began to examine her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, quite healthy as well. I must say, I was quite worried when you said just how long you were in the-" Manuela suddenly came to a pause as she seemed to notice something. Pulling up the stethoscope again, she placed it against Byleth’s back. "Take a deep breath for me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doing so, the sisters could see Manuela frown as she moved the stethoscope around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth, do you feel any discomfort in your chest?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"This is… very disconcerting," Manuela said as she pulled away. "I can't find a heartbeat." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, yeah, By doesn't have one of those," Shez answered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...excuse me?" Manuela asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, dad says it’s a condition she’s had ever since she was a baby. Kinda freaked me out one time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We were sharing a bed and Shez thought I died,” Byleth explained, prompting a huff from her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well yeah, duh, that’s freaky! Luckily, I kept my composure–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You started crying.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I did not! Anyway, yeah, it’s just a thing Byleth has.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…how is that possible?” Manuela muttered to herself, frowning while Byleth shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not sure. It hasn't really bothered me before." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even if you say so, that's not really something I can just ignore." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, maybe it has to do with that crest thing," Shez considered, remembering what Hanneman said. "He says By has an undiscovered crest or something." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm, I have heard about crests being able to physically affect someone, such as being able to heal from something without the need of spell, but I've never heard of someone not having a heartbeat…I'll need to ask Hanneman about what he discovers." She considered Byleth again, before raising a hand and murmuring under her breath as a white glow settled over her palm. “...Hm…well that’s interesting. It’s almost as though there’s something in the way…You do seem healthy otherwise, and…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She suddenly pressed her fingers to Byleth’s neck, earning a confused glance from the mercenary. “Hm…There is a pulse here. At least, something of one…you haven’t had any medical issues before now, have you? No shortness of breath or dizziness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. I haven’t had any issues.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So it’s not a symptom of a lowered heart rate…I guess I really do have to chalk this one up to weird crest magic. That being said, I will ask that you come by immediately if you begin experiencing any discomfort or the like," Manuela requested, before letting out a sigh. "For now, it's almost time for class, which we really should be getting to. Oh, but don't worry Byleth, you'll have until after the mock battle to prepare your lesson plan. Until then, you can have your students self-study, or do some physical training." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks for letting me know," Byleth said as she got dressed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, hopefully classes aren't boring," Shez commented. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Classes were indeed very boring. Nothing against Hanneman, but Shez wasn't really interested in learning about crests for a starting lesson, especially since she herself didn't have one. Though she had to admit, he was passionate if nothing else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even so, by the time classes ended for the day, Shez ended up going on a jog, deciding to use up her restless energy she had built up during the class. Thankfully, with how big the monastery was, she had plenty of space to move around in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"See you tomorrow~" came a rather cheerful voice, making Shez look over as she saw a familiar student waving off a knight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, you’re Dorothea!" Shez said, bringing a hand up in greeting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Oh, you must be Professor Byleth’s sister. I hope your first day of class went well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, bored but otherwise okay. Mind if I ask how By's class was?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, she did her best, though everyone was pretty rowdy," Dorothea said as she let out a small laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh. Ah well, hopefully she gets better at it once she gets used to it. Hope you don't mind helping her out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I imagine Edie will be doing most of the helping, but how can I say no to helping out a fan? Speaking of, I hope you enjoyed the play you went to all those years ago." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, well, if I'm being honest, I didn't really get it, but you were a very nice singer!" Shez admitted, "By really did like the show though! Heck, it's the only time I ever heard her call someone pretty." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh? Is that so?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, it, uh…" Scratching her head for a moment, Shez thought of what to say. "By has trouble expressing herself sometimes, so it was a surprise to hear her say that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, nothing wrong with the strong silent type." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with her. Just, you know, I wanna make sure that she's happy. Now, I'm not saying you should take her on a date or something, but I'm sure she'd be happy to be your friend." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Staying silent for a moment, a smile spread across Dorothea's face. "Heh, I have to say, the Professor is quite lucky to have such a nice little sister." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, well, thanks." Shez said, feeling a bit bashful at her words. "Just making sure to look out for her, she'd be lost without me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I mean, who knows what she’d do without my help?" Almost as if on cue, a purple-haired girl came running past them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"STOP CHASING MEEEEEE!" She screamed out as moments later Byleth came running behind her without a word. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...See what I mean?" </span>

  <span>“Hm…is the professor going to be late?” Ferdinand wondered, glancing around the field where most of their class had gathered. “She really should be on time for this sort of event. It would reflect badly on all of us if she–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s getting Bernadetta,” Edelgard answered, trying not to let too much annoyance show. Though, with Ferdinand, that was always a difficult prospect. “You do remember that she was the one who told us to gather here, correct?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Which is why it’s bad that she isn’t here now!” he insisted, “I realize Bernadetta can be…difficult to find at times, but should the professor really ignore the entire class just for her sake?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor Byleth did tell us to get ready, Ferdie,” Dorothea reminded, “You know, get our equipment, do some stretches, limber up, that sort of thing. Unless your nobility means your muscles don’t get stiff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course they do not! I always ensure that I do my proper stretching and warm ups when I wake up!" Ferdinand said, sounding quite proud of himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In that case, just make sure your gear is ready," Edelgard commanded with a sigh, really wishing her professor hadn't chosen Ferdinand to be part of the team. Add in the fact that she had apparently also chosen Bernadetta because she was 'surprisingly fast' meant they had an uphill battle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry I'm late." Speaking of, it seemed the professor had arrived, walking up with an unconscious Bernadetta under her arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Professor, what happened?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She keeps running away from me for some reason,” Byleth explained with a small frown on her face. "She ended up exhausting herself when I tried to bring her here, so I don't think she'll be able to be in the mock battle." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I see. Well, have you given any thoughts for who will be replacing her? I can offer some recommendations should you wish.” Though, aside from Lindhart, any of them would be a good choice to take up the empty space. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, Emily Korsch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh?” came the surprised voice of a rather plain looking, brown-haired student, standing off to the side, away from the main group, like an extra in a play.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...May I ask your reasoning, professor?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She holds herself well. Even if she hasn’t been joining in during combat practice, she’s always light on her feet and can move quickly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh, no, I'm not that great,” Emily said, very clearly lying. It was almost sad how plainly a flash of irritation crossed her face at being singled out before she managed to affect a nervous expression.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think you could help.” The professor didn’t seem to notice though. Or perhaps she did and simply didn’t care. “It’s a good opportunity, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I really shouldn’t. I-I mean, I’m not worthy to stand with such prestigious people!” She looked like she was holding back genuine disgust at her own simpering. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard was almost tempted to let her join simply for the amusement factor she would bring to the field. However, she did have her responsibilities as a house leader. “Professor, I along with Dorothea, Hubert, and…Ferdinand would suffice as a full team, would we not? I realize it’s not what you planned for, but I’m sure we would suffice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm…I guess. I thought it might be a good opportunity for her though,” Byleth relented, “Are you okay with joining, Dorothea?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Professor! I’ll show the other classes not to underestimate us!” Nodding at her enthusiasm, Byleth walked over to Caspar and extended Bernadetta to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can you keep an eye on her?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure professor!” he said with a grin as he took the unconscious girl. “Hey, Lin, you know any spells that could help with exhaustion?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not unless someone cast a sleep spell on her,” the tired sounding student said, sitting on the grassy field since he wouldn’t be involved in the battle. In fact, he seemed quite relaxed as he seemed to be reading a tome about crests. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that why you are always falling over?” Petra asked, “Such a spell is sounding devious.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, that’s just how Lin is.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do make sure to take care.” Byleth said, before regarding the students she’d take into combat. “Now then, I'll have to rethink my plan…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Was your idea not to split into teams of two?” Ferdinand asked. “Clearly the idea can still work: Dorothea and Hubert in one, with Edelgard and I in the other.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it’ll be one mage and one melee combatant in each group,” Byleth said, shutting that down. “It’s a simple tactic, but an effective one.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In that case, Lady Edelgard and I will be on one team,” Hubert suggested. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” Byleth said, shooting another idea down. “In terms of magic capabilities you are stronger then Dorothea, so having you and Edelgard on one team would make it unbalanced. Not to mention you won’t always be working with someone you’re used to. This isn’t just a battle, it’s also to test how capable you all are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hmph. Very well, I shall follow your command for now, but if we were to lose this battle, well, we shall only have you to blame.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am the field commander, so it’s only fair.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of, how shall we be moving, Profesor?” Edelgard asked as they began to walk towards their starting position. “We have been given a rather disadvantageous starting point compared to the Lions and Deer, and I fear if we attempt to attack one, we may end up getting surrounded by the other.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If we focus on the Lions first, but not if we attack the Deer first,” Byleth said as they started getting ready, “The Blue Lions are too focused on honor, so they won’t attack someone from behind.” She stopped to think for a moment. “Well, since Shez isn't going to be allowed to fight, they won’t.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Lions are a rather straightforward lot aren’t they?” Hubert mockingly noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s if they are as noble as they claim to be,” Ferdinand replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aside from Felix, I doubt any of them would rush in to attack us,” Dorothea pointed out, “Sylvain might, but he would be easy to handle.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hence why Ferdinand and Hubert will lead the way to the Golden Deer while you and Edelgard will follow behind and keep an eye out in case any Blue Lions attack us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A sound strategy, professor.” And with good timing, Byleth heard her dad speak, his voice being amplified to carry across the field. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you all understand already, but the house that defeats the other two houses wins this battle. Defeat is decided when a house loses all its members, or if their ‘commander’ is taken out. Fighting is to go on until either blood is drawn, or someone yields, in which case they are to leave the battlefield.” Sounds simple enough. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you ready, professor?” Edelgard asked, as Byleth noted she was affixing a shield onto her off hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll make sure we bring home the victory.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So confident. This will be interesting,” Edelgard said with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let the mock battle commence!” </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Well well! It seems fate favors me today! To think I, Ferdinand von Aegir, would be fortunate enough to face off against my rival in nobility on this day!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahahaha! You think of yourself as my rival? Oh no, you are quite mistaken my foolish friend, for I, Lorenz Hellman Gloucester, stand above all other nobles in my most esteemed bearing!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! And here I thought you were a gentleman! But now I clearly see just how inflated your arrogance is! Not to worry though, I, Ferdinand von Aegir, shall gladly puncture that ego of yours!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As though you could! For I, Lorenz Hellman Gloucester–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Hubert watched the…whatever this was in front of him continue on, and briefly considered just blasting Lorenz in the chest. And maybe Ferdinand too for good measure…Really, as he considered it, and as the two nobles continued their pontificating, the ideal gradually grew further in appeal to the point that he was actively wondering why he wasn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very well! Hubert, stay back! I shall handle this matter on my own!” Hubert started slightly at being addressed by Ferdinand, before just raising an eyebrow at his “partner” for the excursion. He couldn’t help but wonder if the professor had done this deliberately to get Ferdinand out of the way. If so, he would commend her for the decision, if not for the fact that he had to deal with the idiot in the meantime.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stand aside, Ignatz! This is a matter of noble honor, and I shall handle it on my own!” They even sounded the same…Though there were slight differences to their arrogance, almost akin to subtle flavorings. Ferdinand was a richer hubris born of well-meaning stupidity and ideals he would never live up to while Lorenz was, perhaps, more of a bitter vanity, underscored by inane standards he could never truly meet because of his own natural inadequacies. Not that the fool would ever acknowledge any of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So, um…should we be fighting?” And then there was Ignatz.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to fight me?” Hubert asked, turning up the natural menace his voice carried as he glanced down at the shorter boy as though he were a bug barely worth considering crushing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...a-a-ah, w-well…w-we are still in the middle of a battle–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There really was no response to that aside from blasting the younger man in the chest with a weak ball of magic. Nothing anywhere near dangerous, but enough to knock him solidly off his feet and, therefore, out of the battle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...ow…” Ignatz groaned from the ground while Hubert turned his attention back towards the noble idiots circling each other like a pair of dogs trying to assert dominance. It was ridiculous in all respects and he was fairly certain his time would be better spent anywhere else…up until he noticed a new face stumbling out of the trees nearby.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–swear, the monastery has gotta be in this direction–Eh?” Shez Eisner, younger sister to their newest professor and member of the Blue Lions house, blinked in obvious confusion at the scene she just wandered into. “Uh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Wait, aren’t you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez? What are you doing here?” Ferdinand asked a moment after Lorenz noticed her presence. “Did the Academy allow you to join the mock battle after all?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, uh, no, wait–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert just had an idea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well well well,” he intoned, affecting curiosity as he gazed at the mercenary-turned-student, “It seems the Blue Lions aren’t as honorable as they pretend. To think, they would have their classmate secretly join the mock battle so they would gain an advantage!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert didn’t often raise his voice, but this time he wanted his accusation to carry. He really had to work to keep the grin from his face as Ferdinand and Lorenz turned towards the confused mercenary in abject shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?! How dare they!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez! I expected better of the professor’s sister!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–Woah woah, hold on, that’s not–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lorenz! Shall we put aside our differences at this moment?” Ferdinand requested, leveling his spear towards Shez, “It is clear the Lions have deceived us all!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It most certainly is, and they shall pay for this dishonorable act!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Hold on, I seriously have no idea what you’re talking ab–” But neither idiot listened, instead charging her with their spears raised and ready. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And a moment later, Hubert stepped to the side so Ferdinand wouldn’t hit him as he sailed past, launched by a very frazzled mercenary. Ignatz, in his prone position, was less than lucky given Lorenz landed straight on top of him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, just–Could someone explain what just–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“HEY!” That was Caspar’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert glanced over at the trees where the son of Bergliez was positioned, a look of genuine offense and outrage on his face. “So the Lions are cheating!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–Oh, no, no, I didn’t–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s too late for excuses! Petra, come on, let’s take down these cheats!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! We will be having the vengeance for our comrade who is beaten!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hm. That wasn’t quite what Hubert intended to happen, though–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, the Lions and Eagles are sending out more people!” That was…Leonie’s voice, wasn’t it? “Raphael, Lysithea, come on! Let’s go back up Claude!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You got it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course! We won’t let them get away with this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert watched, somewhat nonplussed, as the remaining members of the Deer, sans Marianne, quickly rushed to back up their leader, which, in turn–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I knew it. Looks like the Deer couldn’t be trusted to keep to the rules after all,” Felix grumbled as he drew his sword and rushed into the fray.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–Hey, Felix!” And was quickly followed by Ingrid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, this might be trouble…hey, wait up!” And then Sylvain–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I’m coming too!” Oh, even Annette. Well, that was the entire Blue Lions house on the field then. That would probably disrupt Dimitri’s defensive intentions, given how he had deliberately chosen and positioned his team, which might be good for Lady Edelgard…though it also meant his lady was severely outnumbered now. And he doubted Bernadetta and Linhardt would be of much aid…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He glanced towards the treeline and felt a smirk come to his face when he noticed a person of interest staring in visible confusion at the growing melee. “Lady Korsch, it seems the entire house is joining the battle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Emily” looked at him for a moment, a flicker of contempt showing in her eyes that warred with the genuine bewilderment there. “What are you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Go help out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She bristled. “You don’t give–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re a lesser noble seeking favor from the future emperor. It is only reasonable for you to take a chance to raise your prestige. So go help. Now, if you kindly would.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shot him a delightfully venomous glare, before charging into the fray as the mock battle spilled into a genuinely chaotic melee. If it weren’t for Lady Edelgard’s presence on the field, Hubert might have simply sat back and watched. Perhaps had a picnic, had he thought to bring the proper supplies.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alas, a retainer’s work was never done.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Byleth was probably the most confused she’d ever felt. And given how Shez tended to be, that was actually saying something for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Things seemed to have been progressing smoothly: Hubert and Ferdinand had moved on ahead to scout out the Golden Deer while Dorothea and Edelgard kept an eye out for the Blue Lions. With how the Lions seemed to be focusing on defense, they decided it would be safe to join up with the others, only to be caught by surprise as they saw several students yelling and charging the field. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gotta say, I always knew the captain was one for underhanded tactics, but I didn’t think I’d see you use them right away!” Leonie shouted as she stabbed her spear at Byleth, the young teacher dodging the attack while she blocked a sword strike from Felix. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This is as good a chance as any to test myself against you!” Felix declared, before having to jump backward to dodge a thunder attack from Dorothea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who are you guys calling underhanded!? You're the ones who decided to rush us without warning!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, sorry about this Dorothea, but if it makes up for it, I promise I’ll take you out on a date after this~'' Sylvain flirted, before ducking as Lysithea tried to blindside him by sending a ball of miasma his way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I must admit, I always wanted to cross blades with you, but I never thought it’d be like this,” Ingrid said, leveling her spear at Edelgard with a noticeable edge to her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If it’s a match you want, then very well, I won't back down.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Yeah, Byleth didn’t know what to make of this. But Felix was charging at her again so she did what came naturally and deflected his swing before punching him in the face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe a little harder than intended, but if it kept him out of the fight, then she could always fix up the damage later. Leonie would be trickier to take care of with her longer reach, but it looked like she was joining Lysithea in trying to take down Sylvain, so–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then there was a familiar flash of light in the distance and Byleth felt a frown come to her face. “Hm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She snapped her fingers and all the students present couldn’t help but look her way at the loud boom of thunder that echoed out. A few flinched, but more didn’t, which was mildly interesting, but not something she was going to focus on. “Things have gotten out of hand. I’ll be right back. Anybody who wasn’t assigned to their teams before the battle started should leave the field now or I will–” What was a good punishment as a teacher? “–give them detention. Or something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She glanced at Felix. “...I might just punch you in the face. It’s up to you which you would prefer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her piece said, she moved towards where her sister had unleashed her “awakened form”, as Shez decided to call it after several hours of arguing with herself, or more specifically Arval, about what its name should be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Well that is a curious power,” Sothis noted in Byleth’s head, “Or…no, I would not call it vile, but it is grotesque, wouldn’t you agree?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm.” That was a troubling word to refer to Shez’s power with. But she could ask Sothis about it later. For now, she needed to see what pushed Shez to use it to begin with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From the looks of it, it was being attacked by a large portion of the Golden Deer and Black Eagles forces at once. Including a number of reserve students who shouldn’t have been on the field to begin with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey professor,” greeted Claude from above her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi Claude. Why are you in a tree?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I’d like to say it’s for a vantage point, but Shez kind of tossed me up here,” he explained, which did explain why he was hanging from a tree branch by his ankle. “I think she got upset after I decided to have everyone on my team attack her at once.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah. Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He shrugged. “She’s pretty obviously the strongest person on this side of the field and I wanted to win.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can’t get girls to like you by beating them up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, now you tell me–Wait, was that a joke?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth ignored him, instead walking through the tree lines and gingerly stepping around fallen students, before she noticed Hubert, who looked a little exasperated. Probably because Bernadetta was clinging to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Should I ask?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bernadetta squeaked, ducking her head behind Hubert at the sound of Byleth’s voice, which brought a frown to the professor’s face while Hubert sighed. “Apparently I’m not as terrifying as Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You sound disappointed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t you be? I actively cultivate this image and yet there she is, traumatizing an entire school year through pure violence.” He sighed, shaking his head. “The world truly is unfair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. How much did you have to do with this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re suspicious of me? What could I have possibly done?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re smirking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s just what my face looks like.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ingrid wants to duel Edelgard.” She paused. “Don’t kill her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know you could be more subtle in your attempts to be rid of me, but fair enough. Come along, Bernadetta. We can find you a better hiding place than my back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that handled, Byleth turned her attention to Shez, who was in the middle of proving her theory that Emily Korsch was actually pretty capable right by going after the Eagle student, who was managing to hold her own, if with increasing frustration as she was forced back by the whirlwind of violence that was Shez when she got going.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So Byleth rolled up her sleeves, metaphorically since she was wearing her coat on her shoulders at the moment, adjusted her arm guards, and strode onto the field before catching her sister’s wrist on a backswing, grabbing the back of her head, and fully slamming Shez’s face into the grass before she could react. Gently, of course. She didn’t want to break her nose again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...mfh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Shez. Is there a reason you knocked out two classes worth of students?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mrhghhl mrrrfh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They attacked you first?” She raised an eyebrow before raising her sister’s head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bwah–Ugh, did you have to shove me into the grass? I got some in my mouth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were ‘awakened’. I know how you get when you’re like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, that’s fair, but now I have grass stains on my face.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you on the mock battlefield anyway?” Her eyes narrowed. “Did you get lost again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” She sighed. “Shez–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I was heading back to the monastery! I think…i-it shouldn’t be that hard to find, it’s really huge!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But you’re over here. Not over there. Why were you out of the monastery to begin with?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay that’s…kind of a long story, mostly starting with me trying to find this place at the market that Ashe mentioned–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, one second.” Byleth released her sister’s head and stood up, glancing at Emily, who looked completely bewildered at what she was seeing. “Good work. Please leave the field though, you’re not supposed to be in this exercise.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Y-Yeah, whatever you say, teach,” she muttered, glaring at Byleth for a second before continuing to look confused by Shez as she walked off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Thought so,” Byleth muttered to herself as she confirmed Emily really was more aggressive than she let on. The girl seemed really resentful, which…well, based on her family name, Byleth had a feeling why that might be. But that was something she could handle later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For now, she helped Shez up to her feet. “You and I are talking to Hanneman after this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, what? Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because you should know how to disengage instead of escalate. That, and you knocked out most of the student body.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I mean…that’s…probably exaggerating?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“At least a few of those students are Blue Lions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh. Whoops…To be fair, I don’t know everyone yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Come on. I’m going to get Manuela and we can start healing the students that need it. Also, you’re telling dad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Awwwww…fiiiiine…” Shez whined, pouting heavily as her sister led her off the field.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So ended the first mock battle of the school year. Unsurprisingly, all three classes were disqualified. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>The library of Garreg Mach Monastery was a peaceful, quiet place most days. The students knew to keep quiet amidst its hallowed shelves and it was rare for there to be much noise beyond the scritching of quills on paper and the quiet chatter of scholarly monks deep in research.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So the sound of heavy footfalls and aggrieved muttering stood out far more than it normally would, especially when the aggravated young woman who was stomping so aggressively slammed her hands on the front desk and glared directly at the head librarian.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tomas. Could we please…talk? I need your help with something,” the student known to most as Emily Korsch growled out, glaring directly at the kindly old man, who regarded her with nothing more than slight bemusement at her appearance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Well, of course I would gladly help any young student who needs my aid. Please, tell me what is troubling you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t mean </span>
  <em>
    <span>right here</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she hissed, “It’s something…private.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, well I’m sorry to say I don’t think I could be of much help in private matters…ah, perhaps Selene could help you? Selene, if you wouldn’t mind, could you come over here please?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily’s eyes narrowed, before she glanced at a woman in the white robes of a priestess, who smiled at the head librarian. “Yes Tomas? Oh, hello young lady. Is there something you need?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes, there is. But I was hoping to talk to Tomas about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you don’t need to worry about troubling me with it! I’ve been happy to help around here ever since Tomas let me.” The woman smiled sweetly, earning a faint, enamored sigh from one of the nearby and more easily distracted monks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you’ve been a wonderful help ever since, Selene,” Tomas praised, “Why, I’m sure one day you could easily replace me here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that’s very sweet of you to say! But I’m sure you still have plenty of years here left in you! So don’t try to foist it off on me too quickly, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tomas chuckled. “No need to worry about that. Now then, I really should get back to my duties. Thank you again for thinking of me, young lady.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Sure,” Emily muttered, glancing at Selene again before the priestess led her towards a more private room so the two could chat about her problem.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And once the door was closed and locked, Selene’s hand was around Emily’s throat as she shoved her against the wall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You stupid little shit, what do you think you’re doing?” the now scowling “priestess” growled in the younger woman’s face, “In what world do you think one of these damned whelps would come crawling to a librarian of all people for solutions to their problems!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“G-Ghhhlk, l-l-let g-g-go-” She did, and Emily collapsed to the floor, coughing as she tried to get air back into her respiratory system.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Selene regarded her with a cold gaze, all anger vanishing as though it had never been, before she unlocked the door and opened it, allowing Tomas to enter. The elderly librarian straightened from his perpetual stoop as he gazed down at his subordinate, a single raised eyebrow showing a reaction beyond the benign placidity still worn on his face. “Well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Hhh…d-damn bitch–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut it, brat,” Selene said, locking the door again, “You’re the idiot who decided she couldn’t be bothered to go through the proper channels. You wanted a meeting, you’ve got it, now share what information you have already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily rubbed her throat, before shaking off the remaining pain. “Why the hell is there another one of us here?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Selene blinked. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You heard me! That purple-haired bitch, the one pretending to be the new professor’s ‘sister’! Who the hell is she and why is she here!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold on, that–There shouldn’t be another agent here, that doesn’t make sense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t, no,” Tomas noted, some curiosity entering his tone, “By ‘purple-haired bitch’, you refer to the one called Shez Eisner, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Selene glanced at him. “‘The one’? Not ‘the beast’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps. It depends on what our young friend has to tell us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily swallowed, before pushing herself to her feet. “...She started glowing during that stupid mock battle. She had…I don’t know, some kind of halo? And markings down her face. White ones.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez…” Selene muttered, as though testing the name on her tongue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is there something you recall?” Tomas inquired.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, that’s the problem. I should know if that was a project name.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You inherited Pitt’s files, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Selene wasn’t the type to wince, but she did frown slightly more than she was already. “...We’re using that name then. Hm. I did, and she didn’t have anything on the subject of a ‘Shez’. Are you familiar?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. That is interesting…A ‘halo’, you said? Or was it more of a crown?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily blinked. “Uh…no, it was behind her head.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How interesting…How could a mere beast have…no, we don’t have enough information to decide anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s an individual of interest then?” Selene asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She might be. She caught my attention already, though it was brief. She seemed put off by my appearance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As though she recognized you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not quite. It would be very interesting though…Regardless, we will observe this beast called Shez. If she possesses something of interest, we will discover it soon enough.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? That’s all we’re doing?!” Emily wasn’t happy with that. “She’s a threat, we should–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You won’t be doing anything, Kronya,” Tomas reminded, “Not until you position yourself properly at the Hegemon’s side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How can I do that!? I just look like some random vermin! You were supposed to get me that red-haired beast, the one that was already close to her! How am I supposed to fulfill any of my objectives when I’m stuck at the bottom rung!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“By being clever for once in your life. You want to be something more than Thales’s mad dog, don’t you? So work for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But Solon–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No names,” Selene chided, prompting Kronya to glare at the older woman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Or else what, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bias?</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well if you want to insist on risking discovery, I won’t stop you,” Bias said, regarding her junior with a cold gaze. “And neither will I save you when the abominations come to eat you alive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If that is all then.” Tomas adjusted his posture again, settling into his “normal” stoop. “Do not attempt to contact me in this way again, Kronya. I won’t have you jeopardizing everything we are working towards because of some foolish impatience. Am I understood?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Understood, sir.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good. Now go, the last thing we need is anyone getting suspicious because you had us meet up like this," Bias said, before unlocking the door, getting Kronya to glare at her before she left. "...still, we should figure out if Myson or Cleobulus might have sent someone else. Those two have gotten far too arrogant." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Only once we confirm whether or not Shez is one of us," Tomas said as he began to head out. Though, knowing those two, it was far too likely they wanted to one up the other. Those two were far too idiotic, particularly without Thales to reign them in. If they weren't careful, they would all end up destroying one another as though they were mere beasts. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"There you are, my king."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Cornelia!” greeted the king on his throne, a goblet in one hand while the other rested on the lower back of the woman in his lap. Or, to be more specific, the wretched drunk known as Rufus Thierry Blaiddyd slurred a reply from his position on a leather chair in his lounge, his wine-stained shirt open to bare most of his chest while his free hand lazily groped the rear of the scantily clad courtesan cuddling up to him while he was being entertained by another barely dressed dancer. “To what do I owe the pleasure, milady Arnim? Have you a care to join my revelries?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cleobulus of Agarthan smiled through the stolen lips of Cornelia Arnim, regarding the useful wretch in front of her with a pleasantry far too thick to allow even a hint of the seething contempt beneath it show. It almost became difficult with how clearly the king-regent was leering at her breasts, but she was quite practiced at her role. “Unfortunately not, my king. I merely wished to speak with you regarding some matters we previously discussed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that. Alright, off,” he commanded, pushing the woman in his lap up, prompting a surprised noise from her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, do you wish us to leave, your grace?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Rufus’s smile immediately dropped. “It’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>your majesty!</span>
  </em>
  <span> I am the king, understood? Now get out before I have you beaten for insulting royalty!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman stiffened, but nodded hurriedly and left along with her cohort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rufus watched them leave, then sank back, pressing his hands to his face. “Goddess, what is wrong with me? I shouldn’t have…I should apologize–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you shouldn’t, my king. It is as you say, you are the king. You can’t let your lessers disrespect you,” Cornelia said as she approached him, putting a hand on his shoulder in a gesture he would probably take as comforting. She mainly used it as a way to steady herself as she leaned down towards him though. “A king must be strong and proud, and we both know how strong and proud you are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...yes. Yes, of course.” Rufus breathed slowly, dragging his hands down his face before he looked up at his only real confidant. “What did you want to discuss? Is this about that order you used to belong to?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not quite, though it is related.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mnnh….look, if your mages need more funding, they can have it. Or is this about the crest stones again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cornelia chuckled. “Ah, you’re getting colder, my king.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am, hm?” A slight smile crossed his face, the tension starting to bleed from his body as he looked up at his advisor. “Well, what then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Before that, it might interest you to know that some bandits attacked your nephew during a training exercise out in Barnabas territory.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He blinked, before a complicated look crossed his face. “...And…is he dead?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She smirked. “Tragically, he still lives, my king.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hmph. Having fun, are we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My apologies, you just looked so adorably hopeful,” she teased, pretending it was affection rather than malice that prompted her to dangle his guilt-ridden hopes in front of him. “It does leave open an opportunity though. The monastery failing to care for its students is something we could press.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Should we? Faerghus exists because the Church gives it legitimacy. Pressing them might be more detrimental than beneficial.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cornelia smirked again. Every so often, her favorite mongrel did show a glimmer of intellect in that drink-addled head of his. “True, true. It’s just something we should keep in mind, should we ever need justification to, say, declare the Academy cannot be trusted to care for its students.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. It would be difficult. The Officer’s Academy is a popular institution, many nobles have fond memories of the place, and if there were no fatalities…No one important died, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, just the bandits.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pity,” the regent muttered, before a flash of guilt crossed his face that brought a bigger smile to his advisor’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That aside, we really should get to the </span>
  <em>
    <span>meat</span>
  </em>
  <span> of the matter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The way his eyes flicked towards her body just made her smirk all the more. “...and that would be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not a matter we need to address immediately…in fact, it might be good to give ourselves a few months to prepare, but…” She grinned. “I think we really should look into the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Empire’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> part in the Tragedy of Duscur.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Myson, we have a report from Solon!" announced an Agarthan dark mage as he hurried to his superior, drawing some attention from the other bird-masked mages within the laboratory.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” The warlock whose attention he sought didn’t reply though, instead keeping his shadowed eyes on the “caskets” lined up along the walls. In particular, he kept his eyes on the metallic box marked with the Fell Star’s symbol, the “Crest of Flames”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Er, Myson? Sir?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it important?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The mage jolted, then nodded. “Er, yes, I believe it is, sir. He reported that there is another Agarthan at the abomination’s monastery. One he was not informed of.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The warlock glanced at him, then held out his hand for the slate containing the message. Once the mage handed it over, he perused it without a response, studying the contents…and then gripping it tightly enough to crack straight through the material. “...Hm. I see. Odesse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The project leader, marked by the clothes of a dark bishop, looked up at being addressed. “Yes sir?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Keep an eye on the revival project. I have matters requiring my attention.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Understood, sir.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The halls of Shambhala shone with artificial light. Nothing close to the daylight that was just out of reach, but bright enough to keep the Agarthan people from fully descending into madness in the depths of their great city. A city that buzzed with a hurried energy under its new leadership.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson knew the value Thales had. It was impossible to deny that their great leader had carried Agartha through its darkest days since the Fell Star and its abominations turned their baleful gaze upon the only true humans upon this accursed world, but neither could he deny that the old man had been a weight upon their backs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His leadership had carried them, certainly, but it clung to them too, dragging them down even as he claimed he would raise them up. What else could explain how it took over a thousand years to even get as close as they were now to liberation? Thales had his place, but now that he was dead, it was time for change.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he arrived at his former leader’s room, Myson glared up at the inert apparatuses he could not access. If the blind old fool had to die, he could have at least provided entry to his systems. Losing the Javelins put them at a distinct disadvantage they wouldn’t have to deal with if the dastard had truly trusted anyone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It only goes to show that Thales truly was unworthy of the leadership he held. Not like Myson, who had a hundred projects running and a thousand more churning in his head. If the Javelins were inaccessible, then he would merely create better weapons. If the Flame Emperor could not be brought to heel, then he would make his own King of Liberation. And if he truly must face the so-called “Children of the Goddess” directly…then he would simply make gods of his own.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A smile came to his face at that thought. To build a god…Only one Agarthan had tried to do similar in their history. And wasn’t it quite the sign that a girl with his power would appear at this time?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A girl with the power of Epimenides…It truly was a new dawn for the people of Agartha.</span>

  <span>So, it turns out accidentally stumbling onto the mock battlefield and causing all the students to rush to the field too gets you in trouble. Apparently, even though it was only practice, it was incredibly disrespectful to tarnish the traditions of the academy. At least, according to the rant Seteth gave them once they got back to the monastery and the disapproving lecture Jeralt personally gave Shez, though she was pretty sure the only reason he was giving it was because Seteth was so annoyed. As such, they were all assigned to something Shez knew all to well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chore Duty. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To be specific, it seemed that it was to be expected that the students assist with chores every week, to help build up discipline and such. But thanks to their actions at the mock battle, rather than having only to help out with chores one day out of the week, they were expected to do so every day for a full week. And while normally Shez was used to chores, turns out there was one here she didn't expect: Pulling out weeds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I can't believe I have to do this rather than spend my time studying." Doesn't help that one of the people she was assigned with kept complaining. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on Lysithea, the more you complain the longer it'll take." Not that Shez didn't understand, turns out having to kneel down to pull weeds out was killer on her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't want to hear that from you! You're the one that got us into this mess!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Technically, it's Ferdinand and Lorenz's fault for charging her first without bothering to talk to her," Edelgard chimed in from where she was pulling out weeds. Technically she didn't even need to be there, since the students who had already been part of the mock battle, and those who didn't rush in, weren't getting punished. Even so, she volunteered to do so, saying as the house leader it was her fault for not being able to control her housemates. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I was just defending myself!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I suppose fighting everyone else on the field was just defending yourself too!” Lysithea snarked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! Basically!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea rolled her eyes, grumbling under her breath, while Edelgard glanced at Shez in some interest. “Speaking of the mock battle, I was wondering if you could tell us what that strange power you used was. I had heard you didn’t have a crest, so I admit I am curious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that? That was my awakened form!” Shez declared, as though that meant anything to the two of them. After noticing her fellow students were just staring at her, she blushed slightly and bent back down. “Ah, heh. Well, basically it’s just a thing I can do. I get stronger and faster for a while. There’s no real downsides to it at all! …Aside from maybe getting kind of wild while I have it active.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. So it is something of a berserker state?” Lysithea asked, getting a little curious despite herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess? I don’t completely lose it, it’s just when there’s tons of people all around me that I don’t recognize immediately and are being aggressive, I just kind of…let loose? I didn’t hurt anybody too bad though, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t, no, though you certainly made an impression on everyone,” Edelgard noted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well hey, that’s a good thing, right? I’m a mercenary, if I’m leaving an impression, that means people will want me on their side!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea scoffed. “Or they’ll be terrified of you like Varley.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To be fair to me, I’m pretty sure Bernadetta was already scared of me, for some reason. Probably because of Byleth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps,” Edelgard replied while making a mental note to ask Bernadetta about her fear towards the Eisner sisters, “Well, hopefully you can keep a grip on that power of yours for your mission this coming month.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, the professors mentioned that. So we basically get a job assigned to us every month? Do we get paid?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Almost every month, sometimes there are other activities that take precedent, and no, we do not get paid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez pouted. “That’s lame. Especially since it sounds like we’re just escorting some supplies that are coming up to the monastery. Kind of doubt we’ll run into anything interesting on a job like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea huffed. “Well what did you expect? You are still a student, even if you were a mercenary.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess. What about you, Lysithea? What have they got your class doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We will be joining the knights on patrol of the countryside within Garreg Mach’s territory.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow. That actually sounds worse than mine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea puffed up, glaring at Shez. “And what is that supposed to mean?! Do you think they are assigning me to easy missions because I am a weak child in need of protection!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re hearing a lot of things I didn’t say. You might want to get that checked out.” Ignoring her indignation, Shez glanced at Edelgard. “How about you, Princess? Is your class doing anything interesting?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know you can just call me Edelgard, yes? As students, we’re all on equal standing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shrugged. “Blame Claude, he got me calling him ‘your grace’ all the time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fairly certain you started doing that all on your own,” Lysithea grumbled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard tried to avoid giggling at the byplay. Despite her words, she couldn’t go acting like a schoolgirl just because her classmates were being amusing. “It seems the Black Eagles have been assigned to hunt down some bandits this month. The remaining Iron King bandits, to be specific.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “What? Seriously!? How come we’re doing escorts while you’re hunting bandits!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard shrugged. She had some ideas, but she wasn’t about to share them. Aside from a deflection, of course. “Perhaps because our teacher is a famous mercenary? They may have greater faith in her combat expertise.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But I’m a mercenary too! Uuugh, this sucks…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now who’s whining like a child?” Lysithea commented, amused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bleh…hey, Edelgard, let me join your house.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked. That was remarkably easy. “...Are you certain? That seems like an extreme course of action to take just because you dislike the mission you’ve been assigned.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, you’re right, I shouldn’t jump ship that eagerly…” Shez sighed. “Well I guess there’s nothing for it. Sometimes you just get a lame job like guarding a turnip farm while your dad gets to do cool stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not quite the situation here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You guarded a turnip farm?” Lysithea asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah, it was an easy job I had to do because I, uh…” Shez grinned sheepishly. “I kind of jumped off a cliff to see if I’d survive it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I lived, didn’t I? I was trying to get stronger from–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How does jumping off a cliff make you stronger?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, right? And that didn’t kill me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite her best efforts, Edelgard couldn’t stop herself from giggling at Shez’s statement, said with such confidence and surety that the princess really couldn’t see the potential threat in her midst as anything other than a genuine idiot.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Carrying a bucket of horse feed with her, Byleth made her way to the stables. A part of her couldn't help but feel a bit annoyed that she was also getting punished because things got out of hand, but at least stable duty wasn't that bad. She was used to helping out her dad with Argo, so she had some experience at least. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Gotta say, never thought of using buckets full of horse food as weights, it's very handy!" Raphael said with a grin, casually bringing his bucket up and down as he worked out. Which… hm, he did have a point.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Leave it to you to see the bright side of this." Sylvain commented as he followed along. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, come on Sylvain, what's there to complain about? I mean, we get to work out our muscles and hang out with horses!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, at least the view will be nice," Sylvain commented as he checked Byleth out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I guess the stables do look nice. Do you like horses?" Byleth asked, misunderstanding what he meant. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I am planning on focusing on mounted combat," Sylvain said, "I mean, it'll get me plenty of practice for when I ask someone out on a romantic horse ride." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I hope you have fun on that, Sylvain!" Raphael cheered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks buddy. What about you, professor? I'm sure someone as experienced as you must have plenty of romantic escapades to share." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not really." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? You're telling me you've traveled all over Fodlan and you don't have even one single romantic story to tell?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh, haven't even kissed a single girl?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why do you keep asking?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just curious. But hey, if you’re ever interested I know a great place in town where plenty of cute girls hang out. Wouldn't mind being your wingman." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s a wingman?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, wow, you really are inexperienced. Uh…think of it like a fellow merc who’s covering your back–No, wait, that doesn’t work…Hm, I need to work on my metaphors.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should ask Hanneman about that, he’s your professor,” Byleth replied as she brought the feed over to the horses.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think metaphor practice is on the class schedule, professor. Hm…hey, quick question, but have you ever kissed a guy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would I kiss a guy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah I should have expected that answer…Ah well, it’s good to confirm.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you like guys, Sylvain?” Raphael asked, hoisting one of the buckets up to a horse, who looked a little bewildered at being offered food so directly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, that’s not how you do that,” Byleth said, heading over to correct him while Sylvain chuckled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, that’s not what I was getting at. Though there was that one…Ah, let’s just say I prefer pretty people, I’m not one for the rugged types,” Sylvain answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that makes sense,” Raphael said, nodding before focusing back on Byleth as she showed him how to properly feed a horse. Apparently it involved setting up the bucket on the stall so the horse could eat on its own.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We have a lot in these buckets though, and there’s a lot of horses here, so we’ll want to divide them up,” Byleth explained, “There should be some empty buckets to fill.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Got it! I’ll get right on that, professor! Don’t worry horses, it’ll be food time soon enough!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sylvain chuckled at the big guy’s enthusiasm, before pausing as he noticed someone else in the stables. “Speaking of pretty girls…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He shouldn’t be surprised to see Marianne around, he’d heard she preferred to stick around the stables, though it was interesting to see her speaking softly to that one horse of hers. Or, no, wasn’t that a different horse?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Definitely looked bigger than her usual horse, more akin to a war horse, so it was a bit surprising to see her talking so softly to it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there Marianne, didn't expect to see you here. I thought you didn't get punished?" Sylvain asked, getting Marianne to jolt in place as she turned around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh, hello, Sylvain," the meek girl greeted, keeping her eyes turned downward as she turned around. "I-I just came by to check on the horses." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aaah, well if you're here, you mind helping me out? I'd love to learn from an expert." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh, n-no, I'm not an expert, I just like horses."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Argo seems to like you," Byleth said, walking up since she apparently knew the name of the horse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh, is he yours?" Marianne asked, getting the professor to shake her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Argo is my dad's horse, but I help take care of him. He doesn't warm up to people easily, so you must have made a good first impression," Byleth said as she moved up to Argo, the horse leaning into her touch as she raised her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-He is a very gentle horse," Marianne said with a smile, getting Sylvain to stare at Argo ,who was probably the most intense-looking warhorse he'd seen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Woah, this horse is huge! I didn't know a horse could have these kinda muscles!" Raphael exclaimed, coming over as he saw everyone crowding around Argo. "What does it eat to get so huge?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He likes raisins, dad tends to mix it into his hay whenever he eats." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A-Ah, Dorte likes raisins as well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll make sure to bring some for him next time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Th-Thank you," Marianne said with a slight smile, getting Byleth to smile back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hm, she had heard Marianne was shy, but she seemed easy to talk to. Maybe because they both liked horses? Hm… maybe finding a common ground with Bernadetta would help with her easily frightened student. But what did they have in common…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, they were both good at running so maybe that would work…</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Even with the extra chores they had to do, the students still had classes to attend to. And the students of the Black Eagles were quite eager to see what exactly their mercenary-turned-professor had in store for their lesson. Sure, she might seem a bit off, but clearly they would be able to learn plenty from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard herself even made sure to sit at the front of the class, ready to see what the Ashen Dragon brought to them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How many of you have killed before?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They certainly weren't expecting that question though. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Professor, may I ask why you are asking us that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The mission we were assigned to involves disposing of bandits, and many of you have yet to see actual combat. I'm not sure why we were assigned this mission so early into the year, but if we are to accomplish it, then I need to know who will hesitate in combat and who won't,” Byleth explained. “So please raise your hand if you’ve killed another human being before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The professor raised her own hand, making it clear that she not only had but was fully comfortable with admitting that fact. Not unsurprising, given her career, but it was remarkably blunt for an educator.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So, in return for that bluntness, Edelgard openly raised her hand. To no one’s surprise, Hubert also raised his with a faint smirk on his face, though a few of their classmates seemed surprised that Ferdinand was among their number.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, I must object to the phrasing of your request!” Ferdinand said, frowning, “I have never once killed an innocent person! I have only dealt with bandits and brigands that threatened the innocents of the Empire!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay? I didn’t say ‘raise your hand if you’ve killed someone innocent’. I don’t think any of you would be raising your hand if that was the case.” Hubert made a faintly amused noise there, which made Bernadetta flinch. Odd that she was sitting so close to him to begin with though. Regardless, the professor continued. “Bandits are still human, Ferdinand. You should keep that in mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ferdinand continued to frown, crossing his arms over his chest. “They might be human, professor, but you can’t tell me they haven’t given up the right to be treated as such by becoming outlaws.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes I can. Ferdinand…No, everyone. I want to be very clear right now. A bandit is a human being. A thief is a person. No matter who they are, no one was born into this world completely alone. The men and women we are going to face more than likely have or have had families. They have friends, they have hobbies, they have likes and dislikes. They have loved and laughed and cried just the same as all of us. It isn’t unusual for bandits to be people who have fallen on hard times. Some are mercenaries who were cheated by an employer. Some are foreign soldiers that were abandoned by their lords. Some are deserters that fled from armies they were forced into. Some were merchants, farmers, or even nobles that were ruined and have chosen to fight rather than lay down and die.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And they will kill you if you allow them to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The professor’s tone was deadly serious as she stared out at the class, looking carefully to make sure everyone met her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They are people. Do not forget that. They are also willing to kill you. Do not forget that either. As outlaws, as Ferdinand has put it, the only thing that awaits them if they are captured is the sword or the rope, and that means they will fight us to the death to avoid that fate. The fact that most of you are nobles won’t deter them from that. In fact, they are more likely to target you because of that fact. Spite is the most powerful motivation a bandit has and these are a ragtag group that just lost their leader. Do not give them any chances because they will not extend any courtesy to you.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I won’t force any of you to kill on this mission, but it is a mission that demands you be willing to kill. I will keep all of you safe. None of you will die if I can help it, but I cannot be everywhere, and you will need to do your best to keep yourself safe. To that effect, I will be partnering each of you up to ensure you remain as safe as possible. If you have any preferences for a partner, I will be taking that into account going forward, though I do not guarantee I will accept your choice if you simply wish to partner with a friend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked, caught off guard by how easily the professor transitioned from her speech on the realities of hunting bandits to talking about pairing up the students, as though this were a mere class trip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are there any questions?” Professor Byleth asked as though it were the most natural thing in the world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bernadetta, of all people, raised her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes Bernadetta?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...c-c-c-can w-w-we s-stay i-in o-our rooms i-instead of g-going?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, Bernadetta.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh…”</span>

  <span>“You plagiarist!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth chewed on the bit of fish in her mouth before glancing up at her sister, who was frowning at her front across the table. She continued to chew, not answering, before finally swallowing. “Hi Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh don’t give me that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Don’t say hi?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know what I mean! ‘They loved and laughed and cried just like us’, huh? Says the woman who has never done </span>
  <em>
    <span>any</span>
  </em>
  <span> of those things?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “It was a good line.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That you stole from dad! That was the exact same speech he gave us on our first bandit hunt!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t the exact same one. I modified it for the situation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez scoffed before actually sitting down, still glaring at her sister indignantly from across the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should eat your food before it gets cold,” Byleth noted, “How did you even hear about my speech anyway?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dorothea told me, duh! She was talking about how intense you were about this bandit hunt thing and guess what? She quoted you word for word so I know exactly how much you ripped off from dad!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Is that the fried pheasant?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, yeah, the Derdriu style one. I figured I’d give it a try since it’s from Claude’s fancy city. What did you get?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bourgeois pike. It’s apparently fancy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Is it good?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretty good. Not sure if it’s fancy though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yeah, I guess it–Wait, hang on, I was mad at you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth pouted. “Aw, I thought I distracted you. Oh well. Also, I love you and dad, so I have loved before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know that’s not what I meant! I’m also pretty sure that’s not what that saying means. I think?” Shez frowned to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me professor, do you mind if I sit here?" A tired sounding voice caught their attention as they saw Lindhart approaching. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, sure Lindhart." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you." The student said before sitting down with them. "Now, professor, is it true that you have an undiscovered crest?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"According to Hanneman." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, he's been quite excited about it, hence why I came here. You see, I have an interest in crests myself, so I was hoping you'd let me study you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...how so?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh nothing too intrusive, just a few samples, such as a lock of hair, or the like." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You do know how weird that sounds, right?" Shez asked the green-haired boy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is it? I personally think it's a much better option than blood. Ah, speaking of, professor, I was hoping you'd let me stay on the sidelines in the upcoming mission. My specialty is primarily healing magic, so I won't be much good on the frontlines." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll keep that in mind, and if you just need hair-" Reaching down, Byleth pulled out her dagger, before cutting off some hair to hand to Lindhart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“By, don’t give random guys your hair,” Shez chided, frowning at Lindhart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s just hair. Besides, Lindhart is one of my students, so he’s not some random guy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, professor,” Lindhart said, ignoring the byplay as he took the hair and placed it in some type of sample bottle. Then he glanced at Shez. “Hm…Could I request yours too? I heard you don’t have a crest, but you apparently displayed some type of ability at the mock battle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Apparently? You didn’t see it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was asleep, so no.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, huh. How the heck did you sleep through all that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m a very good sleeper. So?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, yeah, no, there’s no way I’m giving you any of my hair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shame,” Lindhart replied before yawning as he got up. "Well if you change your mind, feel free to find me. I have some research to do." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Make sure to get some rest before class tomorrow," Byleth advised as he left before turning back to Shez. "So, you're friends with Dorothea?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I guess? She's probably the one I talk to the most from your class. Besides, why wouldn't I want to get to know my sister's first crush~?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't have a crush on her," Byleth reiterated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So you say~!" Shez teased. "Still, are you gonna be okay on the mission of yours? Dorothea seemed nervous about it all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged as she finished her fish. "The bandits aren't strong, but I need to make sure everyone is ready for it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well you got that new power right? I'm sure it'll be okay with that. Not to mention the Princess is pretty strong right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, she's going to be in charge in case we split into two groups while fighting." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well that's a start! And besides, if there's any trouble, you can always ask me for help with training them!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have a feeling if I do you'd just beat them up until you think they're decent." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s your point? That’s still training!” Shez argued before her smile seemed to soften, "Still, you need to take care too, By. You get attached to people easier than I do, so I wanna make sure you're okay." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll be okay. Try not to show off so much on your mission." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, not like I'll be able to. Not much I can do for an escorting thing aside from walking slightly faster than everyone else." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You'd probably get lost if you got too far ahead." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We'll be going in a straight line, how am I going to get lost??" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How'd you get lost on your way to the monastery?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'm never gonna live that down, am I?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I certainly won't let you," Byleth teased, making Shez pout. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Feh, at least let me eat my meal in peace," Shez complained before beginning to eat, "Oh, this is actually pretty good." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can I have some?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw." </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The silent scratching of a quill was the only noise in the room as Byleth prepared for the upcoming mission. She was rather lucky to have the month to prepare for what was to come, but without any knowledge of where the battle would take place, all of her plans would ultimately be guesswork. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If nothing else, having a near-even split of melee and ranged students meant she could partner everyone up no problem. And of course, she would be able to further pair up the groups with her and Edelgard as the respective leaders should the need arise. That being said, it was still difficult, several of the students hadn't killed before, and there was no way of knowing how they would react. Bernadetta and Lindhart in specific didn't seem like they might take it well, given how the former was scared easily, and the latter might have an aversion to blood based on his request for samples he gave her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My my, but you are taking this rather seriously." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have to,” Byleth answered without looking up at Sothis, “It’s my job to keep my students safe and happy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You certainly took that idea to heart quite quickly.” Sothis floated over her vessel’s shoulder, glancing curiously at the papers she laid out. “Would it help to discuss your tactics with me? I may not have all my memories yet, but I am sure I can offer plenty of wisdom!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How does this look then?” Byleth asked, as she slid a paper over so Sothis could read it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? So you are planning to make that young archer your partner for the mission? I’m not certain how much help she would provide with how skittish she is.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hence why I’m partnering up with her. She might not handle combat well, so I'll need to keep an eye on her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I suppose I can see the logic. In that case, may I suggest partnering up the young brigid girl with that sleepy healer rather than that boastful noble? Protecting the healer is quite important, so having someone who can react quickly would be a boon to him rather than someone who rushes in.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm… that makes sense. I suppose I can have Dorothea pair up with Ferdinand then…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The young songstress does seem to keep a level head, so she would be capable of keeping him focused. Hopefully at least. I suppose that explains why you are having that dark and brooding one paired with the short brawler?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Caspar doesn’t keep track of his surroundings, so Hubert can cover him there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And may I ask your reasoning for having the young emperor-to-be paired with that minor noble?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She tried to hide it, but Emily raised her hand when I asked if anyone had killed. Edelgard is strong, but if we do end up splitting the class in two, she might not be ready to have to keep an eye on someone who hasn’t killed before, while keeping track of everyone else. That, and Emily was able to keep up with Shez, even if she was on the defensive, so she could help cover the other team.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True, though you might wish to discuss the matter with the future emperor beforehand. I don’t think the two much like each other.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You noticed that? I was hoping it was something small. Emily seems resentful, but it should be something she can work past, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps. Or perhaps not. It depends on where that resentment comes from.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…Okay. I’ll talk with both of them beforehand. I needed to discuss these plans with Edelgard either way," Byleth decided, getting up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, before you go." Moving in, Sothis grabbed onto Byleth’s face. "I don't know how well I will sleep if I were to behold something tragic, so I shall grant you the power to turn back the hands of time, but know this power is not infinite." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she said this, Byleth felt something rush through her, as if suddenly energized. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...How many times can I turn back time?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If I were to hazard a guess…three times. Once those three are done, you will have to recover before you can use any more. Perhaps I'll be able to gain more in the future, but for now, those are your limits."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nodding at that, Byleth collected her papers. "Thank you, Sothis." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, you've gotten better at showing gratitude. I suppose you aren't as much of a child as I thought," Sothis said, before she faded away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm." Leaving her room, Byleth made her way to Edelgard’s room, seeking to speak with her first. Thankfully while the sun was starting to set, it was still light out, so she was likely still awake. And thankfully she was as Byleth knocked on her door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Who is it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Edelgard, I needed to discuss some things with you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor?" It seemed she was surprised to hear Byleth knocking, but she still opened her door a few moments later. "Was there something wrong?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, I simply wanted to discuss the upcoming mission. As the house leader, I imagine you would have your own thoughts on my plan." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose so. I am just a bit surprised you came this late in the day. One would think you would have discussed this after class or the like." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh… should I go?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, you're already here so I suppose it will be fine. May I know what exactly your plans are?" Nodding, Byleth handed over her paper of the planned teams to the young heir. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm." A frown became evident on her face after she read. "I can understand your reasoning, but might I suggest Miss Korsch be your partner instead? I do not think we would work well together." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you can tell me why you do not like her. I can tell you and her resent one another, but if it's only something minor then I won't change the plans." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." That made Edelgard’s eyes narrow for a moment. "I would not call it resentment, but I fear that she might be more focused on attempting to curry favor from me rather than be a useful partner." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But you seem okay with Dorothea?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s a difference,” Edelgard stated, her voice firm. “Dorothea is a commoner trying to rise from her position. She had nothing and has gained much through her own work and merit. Emily is a noble born in luxury who is trying to gain more for herself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…don’t most nobles want that though? The lower ones want to rise higher.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And the higher nobles wish to hold onto their positions. I am well aware of that, professor, and I dislike it. I do not mind a person trying to rise on merit, I do mind when they try to rise through nepotism. Spirit should matter more than blood, and I’ve seen little of Emily that makes me think she’s anything other than another greedy noble seeking favor she feels entitled to. You said it yourself that she’s resentful. Are you sure that wouldn’t make her more of a danger to me than a help?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “She’s still a student. It would be weird for her to try to hurt you, especially if she wants to curry favor with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned. “So you’re willing to risk it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want to help all of my students,” Byleth explained, “I think that means I need to push you all sometimes. I can’t help Bernadetta if she’s going to hide away all the time, so even if she’s afraid, I have to give her that push.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Edelgard’s frown deepened. “And you think I’m afraid of Emily?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I think you don’t like her. I want to see if that can be fixed." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There is nothing to fix, professor," Edelgard stated, her voice carrying a finality to it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Very well, I apologize for taking your time," Byleth replied, before bowing to her and leaving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Edelgard said nothing else as she closed her door. With a faint bit of unease settling down on her, Byleth walked towards Emily’s room, hoping this would be easier than what just occurred.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What!?" And she instantly sounded irritated when Byleth knocked on her door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...It’s me, your professor," Byleth answered, hearing a groan of anger from the other side in response. She almost flinched as the doors were almost violently opened as Emily opened the door with barely contained irritation in her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you need something, professor?" she asked, trying to keep a nice tone to her voice and largely failing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I wanted to talk to you about the upcoming mission." Byleth said, not wanting to anger another student. "Specifically who I was going to partner you up with." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh? And who would that be?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I had planned on partnering you with Edelgard," That seemed to surprise Emily. "But it appears as if there are some issues between you two." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh, issues? With Lady Edelgard? I don't know what you're talking about." Despite her words, her eyes seemed to harden. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so…this might just be my guess but you almost seem to resent her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-Why would I resent her?" She asked, before reaching for her door. "Look, I don't know what you're trying to insinuate, but I'm having none of it. Good night!" And with that, Byleth got a door slammed in her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Byleth felt the urge to let out a sigh, but she stayed silent as she went back to her room. She could figure things out later. Hopefully.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The next day Byleth accidentally woke up a bit late, since she had stayed up changing her plans, as well as writing up what supplies she’d need for everyone. Thankfully, she managed to get to class right before the bell rang, so she wasn’t late. That being said, aside from Lindhart and Emily, she was the last person to arrive in the classroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning, everyone,” Byleth greeted the class as she walked in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning, professor!” Caspar greeted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello there, professor,” Petra also greeted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she reached her desk, Byleth couldn’t help but notice only those two had greeted her. Looking up, she noticed Edelgard giving her yet another calculating gaze while Hubert seemed to be outright glaring at her. Ferdinand, meanwhile, seemed to be only frowning, and Dorothea looked away from her with a small huff. As for Bernadetta…well, she was just hiding under her desk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey professor, do you mind if I ask you something?” Caspar asked as he raised his hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course Caspar, what did you want to ask?” Byleth replied, trying to ignore the unease she felt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, I tried to think about what you said yesterday, but I don’t get it. I mean, the bandits are bad guys right?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...You can be a bad person and still be a human, Caspar.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m pretty sure you can’t. Isn’t that what ‘outlaw’ means? They’re bad guys, so the law doesn’t protect them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re still human though. Human doesn’t mean good. Humanity is neutral.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t we say someone has ‘humanity’ when they show kindness?” Hubert pointed out, his tone mocking, “I think that would mean it is ‘good’ then, wouldn’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, see? Hubert gets it!” Caspar said with a grin, which made Hubert’s smirk falter into a sigh of exasperation. “So if you do bad stuff, you’re inhuman, right? So your speech doesn’t make a lot of sense, professor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth felt like she was being made fun of. Though Caspar did seem earnest…Things were still weirdly tense now and she wasn’t sure why. “Okay, I don’t think my meaning came across, so I’m just going to say that bandits belong to the human species. I don’t know about the rest of that, they’re just part of the species. Does everyone agree on that point?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh…I guess?” Caspar replied, before looking at Hubert, for some reason. Though the dark-haired student did seem to be considering the question, and smirked again when he came up with a reply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, professor, I have heard bandits be called ‘subhuman’ before, so–”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello Lindhart,” Byleth greeted as her sleepiest student wandered in, internally thankful for the interruption.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, hello professor. Thank you again for the hair samples.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That prompted a fair amount of bewildered staring from her students. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...We’re starting the lesson now,” she decided, turning away from her students in favor of writing something on the board. She wasn’t sure what it was going to be yet, but she could probably come up with something as she went along.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teaching really was harder than she thought…</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>In the days leading up to the mission things had certainly been… difficult. A nervous energy had settled across the class which only grew as the day grew closer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It didn't help that several of Byleth’s students were starting to be on guard around their professor. As it stood, only Lindhart, Caspar, and Petra didn't seem to agitated when around her. It felt very…uncomfortable compared to how the students were before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, she would do her best to make sure everything would go well! She even made sure everyone was fully prepared and stocked for the mission! …Even if she did have to dip a bit into her own funds. One thousand gold was nowhere near enough for her whole class… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So, with her own money used, she made sure everyone had brand new gear and a vulnerary if necessary. Thankfully, the Anna at the market was willing to give a discount for the bulk order. Still felt like she was being gouged though…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, we are almost at the Red Canyon. I do hope you are prepared and won't lead us into battle so absent-mindedly," Hubert said, bringing her out of her thoughts as she remembered what was happening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to worry, Hubert. I’ll keep my focus when it’s time to fight,” Byleth answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“See that you do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was an odd response, but then Hubert had been one of those students that was on guard around her now. She didn’t know what she did to upset him, but it probably had to do with Edelgard being upset with her, which also seemed to make Ferdinand and Dorothea upset with her and Byleth genuinely didn’t know how to deal with any of that. She was not prepared for more than half her class being annoyed with her specifically; pre-battle jitters made sense, plenty of new fighters had that, but only Bernadetta seemed to be experiencing that specifically.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-Is it too late to go home?” she whimpered, clutching her bow as though it were a shield. Hm. Maybe Byleth should get her a shield? Most archers didn’t use one since it would throw off the weight of their arms, but maybe she could just wear it on her back like a turtle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While Byleth contemplated the practicality of giving Bernadetta an actual shell to hide behind, Edelgard watched her professor with a newfound suspicion. The woman was already unusual, but suddenly trying to push Kronya on her not long after Shez was clearly shown to have some connection to Those Who Slither…It was difficult to believe that either Eisner sister could potentially belong to that group, but she needed to consider all possibilities going forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ever since Thales’s passing, she had been given more freedom from Those Who Slither, but that did not mean she was completely free. And while she was the one who had planned on running into Jeralt’s Mercenaries 'by chance', there was still a slight possibility that said mercenary group had already been infiltrated. If she were to truly change Fodlan for the better, then she couldn't leave anything up to chance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Gold for your thoughts, Edie?" Dorothea asked, bringing her out of her thoughts in favor of focusing on the songstress. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just… thinking about our professor, I suppose." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing pleasant I imagine? You had quite the serious face there," Dorothea guessed as they walked close to one another, "Yeah, I fully understand. Mercenary or not, that speech of hers was far too intense. Heck, it almost sounded like she was parroting off something she heard someone else say rather than her own words. It makes me wish her sister joined our class to act as a buffer." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm." Edelgard gave a noncommittal noise in response, not wanting to give her own thoughts away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, hopefully this mission will be over soon so we can head back to the academy. Are you up to head to town with me, Edie? There's this shop I've been wanting to go visit for a while." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If I have the time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Great, I'll make sure to hold you to it!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is everyone ready?" Byleth asked as they arrived at where the bandits were hiding out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"N-No!" squeaked out Bernadetta.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't worry Bernadetta, stick close to me and you'll be okay." Those words probably would have been comforting, if they weren't said in her usual deadpan way. "I trust you all remember who your partnered up with?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For the most part, the partnership was as she had planned, but with a slight change. Rather than Emily and Edelgard working together, Byleth had swapped Emily and Ferdinand around. Which meant the minor noble was partnered with Dorothea, not that Emily seemed happy about it either way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, Professor! Come on, let's go kick some ass!" Caspar shouted, ready and eager to charge. Nodding as it seemed everyone was ready, Byleth drew her sword. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Very well, before we go, I'll say this: if any of you need to retreat for any reason, then do so, and make sure to have your partner escort you to the knights. Nothing good will come from fighting beyond your limits, but in the event you do need to retreat, send a spell up into the air to let me know you are retreating. Send two if you're in need of immediate rescue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have also been informed that there are two paths ahead, one to the north and one to the west, once we get past this bridge. I shall be leading the main charge to the north, while Edelgard shall be leading the western charge. Petra, Lindhart, you two shall be in her group after we split ways."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have understanding, professor. I will be doing the best!” Petra affirmed, nodding sharply while Lin sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure we can’t just do well enough? I don’t really want to be ‘the best’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…I do not have understanding. Is ‘the best’ a something to be doing or a something to be being?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It can be either. You can do your best, or you can be the best,” Byleth explained, before nodding her head to the group, “So do your best to be the best, everyone. I know you’ll succeed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With her piece said, the mission began.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Dorothea never considered herself a fighter. Sure, she was taught how to defend herself, and had been in her own fair share of scraps defending herself or others, but there was a difference between that and what she was doing now. The worst she had done before was break a creep’s arm. Now, even while it was sheathed, she couldn't help but focus on the weight of the sword at her side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t know why her professor had given her a sword, when it was clear she only intended to use magic for the mission, but she found the intense mercenary a bit too unnerving to say no to. A part of her had wished Manuela had been in charge of the Eagles instead, but, well, too late for that to happen. Letting out a sigh, she couldn’t help but glance at her ‘partner’ for this mission. She’d never actually talked with Emily, but her poor acting aside, it was clear she held everyone there in contempt, so she wasn’t exactly happy about teaming up with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not that she had much time to think about her as the mercenary-turned-professor began the battle by directing an opening salvo of magical attacks straight at the pair of axe-wielding brigands standing guard at the bridge. Once the two fell over before they even had a chance to react, the Eagles rushed in, with Edelgard leading the charge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If this was a play, Dorothea would almost say Edelgard and even Ferdinand looked like gallant heroes as they cut down two more bandits. As it stood Dorothea couldn't help but grimace at the sight, especially as Caspar smashed a bandit with his fist, letting out a battle cry while Petra finished the archer next to him in one move. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shaking her head, Dorothea followed behind, before her attention was caught by Emily rushing forward as soon as Edelgard’s group broke to the west. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, wait!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t break ranks!” Byleth shouted at Emily, who didn’t listen as she drew her sword, immediately slashing a bandit’s arm open before stabbing him in the chest as he screamed. Dorothea couldn't help but think Lindhart was lucky to be with the other group as he definitely would have fainted at the sight if he stuck around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hubert, Caspar, group up with her!” Byleth shouted as she blocked an axe hit from a bandit while Emily made no attempt to return to the group. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite her own trepidations, Dorothea raised her hand as the two students followed the professor’s orders. Gritting her teeth, she sent a bolt of thunder into the bandit, knocking her away from the professor before she could swing again. She did her best to tune out the scream of pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Byleth said, before her eyes scanned over to the west, able to make out Edelgard’s group fighting in the distance. “Bernadetta, can you take out the mage the bandits have over there?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“E-Eh!?” The archer squeaked, having not even drawn her bow once during the mission so far. “B-But w-what if I hit s-someone on our side!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can do it, trust me,” Byleth assured, her tone even. Dorothea was starting to understand what Shez meant by her having trouble expressing herself since she still said that in her usual monotone. Shakily drawing her bow, Bernadetta aimed, before letting the arrow loose, closing her eyes before it could land to see if it hit the target or not. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not that Dorothea could blame her since her own gaze turned away from the arrow, which let her notice something behind Bern. Slowly shambling up, the bandit that Dorothea thought Emily killed was still alive, and gripping a dagger. Channeling her magic, Dorothea shouted as the bandit rushed towards Bernadetta. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bern watch out!” </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Edelgard couldn’t help but note that facing the bandits in the canyon was very different from fighting them in the forest. Leaving aside the change in scenery, she wasn’t on the defensive this time and actually charging in to hunt them down felt…harder to justify, almost. It was also something of a surprise to see them here in the Red Canyon to begin with, given that, with Kostas’s death, she hadn’t had the opportunity to direct them anywhere in particular. She might even blame it on fate, if she believed in that kind of thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Either way, she had little time to think about principles after the professor began the engagement by directing an opening salvo of magical attacks straight at the pair of axe-wielding brigands standing guard at the bridge. Once the duo was dead, their teams went straight into battle, and Edelgard led the charge along with Ferdinand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A fighter fell to her axe while Ferdinand drove his spear through the chest of another thief. Meanwhile, Petra handled the archer in their group and Caspar crushed another bandit’s skull beneath his fist. “Ha! That’s one for me! Who’s next?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, at least he was enthusiastic. She could focus on her classmate’s reactions later; she had a mission to complete. Though, even as she said that, she did notice Linhardt looked pale already from the gore strewn around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Linhardt! Focus!  We’re heading west!” she shouted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–R-Right. Ugh, it’s just…no, don’t think about it,” he muttered, hurrying along to catch up as Petra and Ferdinand moved ahead. The majority of the bandits appeared gathered at some type of ruined shrine up ahead, and she could hear shouts and panic as they realized they were about to be hit from multiple sides.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard raised her shield as arrows started flying towards her, feeling some satisfaction as they bounced straight off the metal. “Find cover!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ferdinand and Petra hastened to obey while Lindhart stuck by her. Not quite the formation the professor planned, but it was working well enough as they kept the ranged bandits’ attention. She could see a healer among their number, who might be a priority target–Or at least he would be if he hadn’t just gone down gurgling from an arrow piercing straight through his throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Good work, Bernadetta,” Edelgard murmured under her breath, making a note to praise the girl in person later, before charging forward as the archers faltered, in large part because a ball of darkness slammed into one’s head and rendered it down to blackened bone in less than a second. “And good work, Hubert.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A part of her wished she had been the one in charge of the main strike force so she could keep an eye on everyone, but as it stood, this secondary path was both lower and had several rocky outcroppings blocking her sight of the others. Which meant she had little else to focus on besides the remaining bandits, one of which was standing in the middle of some ruins.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“OH COME ON!” whined one of the bandits, “I only just got to be boss! This is horseshit!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Did you think fortune would favor you, thief?” Ferdinand asked, grinning confidently as he leveled his spear at the bearded brigand wearing a bandana. “I would ask you to lay down your arms, but we both know–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What he knew wasn’t immediately clear, given the bandit snarled in pure rage and flung his axe full force at Ferdinand’s skull at far too close of a distance for Edelgard to get in the way and block–Then Ferdinand was on the ground and Edelgard felt an actual flash of alarm before she realized their professor had just tackled him out of the way before blasting the bandit leader straight off the platform with a bolt of lighting through the heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–P-Professor!?” Ferdinand exclaimed before Byleth got off of him, her eyes scanning the area for further threats.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I saw sixteen. How many do we have dead around here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Huh? Ah–W-Wait, you just–You just saved my life–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it happens. Eyes open, we need to confirm the bandits are handled,” she stated quite bluntly–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Y-You’re bleeding!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” Byleth brushed a hand against her head, frowning as she searched for a wound before wincing slightly as she found it near the side of her head. “Ah, that’s annoying. Hm…I don’t think the axe blade hit me, this might be a scrape from the fall.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A scrape!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Scrapes can bleed, it happens…hm, maybe the axe did nick me? Though I think there would be more damage then…Head wounds bleed more than most, so I wouldn’t worry.” She rooted around in her coat before pulling out a flask and simply downing the vulnerary, all while clearly keeping an eye out on the surrounding area. “Hm…Edelgard, do you see anything?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The future emperor started at being addressed, before she felt her face heat slightly in embarrassment at realizing she’d just been staring at the professor. “Er…no, and I think the sounds of fighting just ceased.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. Are you okay Ferdinand?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Y-Yes, of course! I am perfectly fine, thanks to you, professor!” Ferdinand grinned as he picked himself up, though he did frown slightly at the dust now marring his clothes. “Er…ah, so is that mission accomplished then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Once we check to make sure all the bandits are handled, yes. Also, our job was to kill all of them. Don’t ask for surrender with that objective.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, well, I wasn’t actually intending to ask that, it was more…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were taunting him then. That’s fine, but save that for when the enemy is already dead or no longer a threat. He had an axe, he was still a threat,” the professor bluntly explained, before walking to the edge of the shrine and hopping down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Somewhat curious, Edelgard found herself looking over the edge as the professor strode over to the bandit leader, the hole in his chest visibly smoking from the bolt that had gone through it, before she calmly swung her sword down on his neck and severed his head in one blow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eugh.” Ferdinand had also moved over to peek, and when Edelgard looked at him, he returned her gaze with a slightly sheepish smile. “I, ah…she has a very…efficient way of doing things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Efficient is one word for it,” Edelgard replied. The fact that the professor had leapt in again, this time to save Ferdinand…Well, it didn’t rule out ulterior motives. It was just hard to imagine that she might have them with how blunt she tended to be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for the rest of her class, everyone else seemed to be fine…though she did notice both Dorothea and Hubert seemed to be staring at “Emily”, who was absolutely drenched in blood and actually smiling. So. Hm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh, is that it?” Caspar asked, glancing around, “Did we get all of them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It looks like it,” Professor Byleth said as she returned with a bloodied bag in hand, “Good work, everyone. I’ll ask the knights to perform another sweep to check for stragglers and clean up, but you all did very well. Good work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were some smiles and, in Caspar’s case, a cheer at the praise, before everyone began making their way back towards the monastery. They would meet up with the knights first and then be on their way back, though Edelgard did hang back, partially to make sure everyone was present and accounted for on the way back, and partially to speak with her professor after the fact. Though she was surprised to notice Bernadetta was also hanging back instead of running straight for safety.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In fact, the smaller girl actually went right over to the professor instead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-A-Ah…I-I-I’m s-s-sorry you were stabbed because of me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked. What?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I d-didn’t even see that thief a-and–” Bernadetta squeaked, though not from her usual fright. No, it was more out of surprise as Byleth suddenly gave her a pat on the head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You did fine. Sometimes that happens. I’m not mad.” Byleth smiled. It was small and a little stiff, but there was a clear smile there. “Good work out there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Y-Y-You’re n-not m-m-mad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not mad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-And y-you’re n-not l-lying?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not lying either. I think you did a good job. Thank you for doing your best.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Bernadetta ducked her head with a little blush on her face, fidgeting with her fingers. “M-Mm…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to buy you a shield? I know you’re an archer, but you could wear it on your back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Huh? U-U-U-Uh…th-th-that sounds h-heavy? A-Ah, n-n-not th-that I d-don’t like your i-idea, please don’t be mad!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not mad. We can figure something else out.” Byleth tilted her head, thinking. “Do you like horses?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-H-Huh? I-I-I, u-u-u-uh…I-I-I’m n-not…s-s-sure?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. That might be something to explore. You should probably head back now, I think Edelgard wants to talk to me too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-Ah!” Bernadetta stiffened, noticing Edelgard. “S-S-Sorry! I-I-I d-d-didn’t m-mean t-to g-get i-in your way!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s quite alright, Bernadetta–And she’s already running.” Edelgard sighed as she watched the shorter girl sprint past her. “It’s hard to believe she’s the same age as me sometimes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, she’s seventeen,” Byleth noted, “Eighteen this year as of the twelfth of the Ethereal Moon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard paused, then regarded her professor curiously. “You know her birthday?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I looked up everyone’s birthdays in the registry. I’m sorry I missed Hubert’s, but I made sure to get Ferdinand flowers for his.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked, thinking back to Ferdinand happily declaring how he had a secret admirer who left flowers on his doorstep. “I think he might have misinterpreted that gesture, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He did? How?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…Well, never mind. I’m sure Hubert wouldn’t mind receiving a birthday present. A month late, admittedly, but still.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I should…I did get some stuff for my sister’s classmates since two of them had birthdays this month and I did give Raphael some smoked meat for his…” The professor nodded to herself. “Very well, I will get Hubert something too. Do you know anything he would enjoy in particular?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Coffee beans and board games,” Edelgard answered with a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, thank you. Did you have something you wanted to talk with me about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No, not especially. I just wanted to make sure everyone made it back fine.” Though…well, it was a risk, but she may as well ask. “I will admit though…are you really just concerned for Emily’s well-being? You don’t have any ulterior motives?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Yeah, I have one.” She shrugged. “I killed her uncle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked. “...Hm. Would you care to explain?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure. I think I mentioned being in Enbarr at one point to you before. I went to the Mittelfrank Opera Company with my dad and sister. Shez and I wanted to make it a surprise for our dad, so she and I went to get tickets ahead of time. We encountered a noble in the street who made advances and threats towards us, so I stabbed him in his vitals and left him to die on the ground. Then I noticed there was a girl in the registry that shared the same family name as him, so I looked into her and found out what connection they had.” She shrugged again. “I don’t feel guilty for killing him, but she’s my student, so I need to make sure she’s safe and happy. I don’t know if she knows, but she seems to hate it here, and I can understand that, so I want to make things right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I see. Do you plan to share this information with her? Because I will point out, you just admitted to murdering a noble. That is a crime that people would take notice of.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure yet. I might. It could clear the air between us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” She genuinely was that honest, huh? “Professor…I’m not sure you have a correct idea of what type of person Emily is. She’s…trouble. And I would prefer you not hand her any rope she may attempt to hang you with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, I’ll keep that in mind. I’m not decided yet. She does seem kind of sadistic, so it would probably be a bad idea. I’m still keeping it in mind though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s all I ask, professor,” Edelgard replied while wondering if she needed to take steps to remove the “trouble” that was Emily Korsch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She also couldn’t help but think, on the way back, that she’d just learned another element of interest to her professor’s character. Because yes, she was the type of person to remember birthdays and get gifts even for people outside of her class, and she was also the type of person to murder someone without hesitation the instant they showed themself to be a threat to her loved ones. Which definitely made her dangerous…but also potentially useful. It all just depended on if Edelgard could keep her on her side…and that meant she had to solve the mystery of Shez Eisner as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She really did have her plate full. Especially since it wouldn’t be long before she had to don a familiar guise again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, the Flame Emperor would have to appear once more…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the meantime though, Edelgard watched as her professor was chewed out by Seteth for trying to bring a severed head back into the monastery.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…She really had no idea what to make of such an utterly bizarre woman.</span>

  <p>So that was a good first assignment! Sure, Byleth might have seen two of her students die, but she was able to save them, so she felt proud of herself. Even if she did get yelled at afterwards. If she wasn't supposed to bring back the head they should have said so… </p><p> </p><p>Still, she felt good, so she made sure to get a nice breakfast before her meeting with Rhea for the next mission. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, By, how'd your mission go?" Shez asked, sitting across from her. </p><p> </p><p>"Went well. Apparently we aren't supposed to bring back bandit leader heads."</p><p> </p><p>"Seriously? Then how are they gonna know we actually took them out?" Shez asked, getting her sister to shrug. </p><p> </p><p>"How'd things go for you?" </p><p> </p><p>"Eh, pretty boring. Only problem we faced was some wolves, and it wasn't even big ones, just normal wolves." Shez sighed. "Didn't even have to fight."</p><p> </p><p>"Well, at least nothing bad happened? But hopefully your next mission is more exciting." </p><p> </p><p>"It better be!" Sighing again, Shez leaned back in her chair. "Have you gotten your next mission?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not yet, I was going there after I ate." </p><p> </p><p>"Well I just hope my mission is cooler than yours this time. Heck, apparently you went to a sacred place?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yeah. Zanado, apparently it was where the goddess lived." </p><p> </p><p>"Seriously? It must have been impressive." Byleth shrugged in response. </p><p> </p><p>"It was mainly some ruins but…it felt familiar…" </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, really?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I've never been there before, but it felt like I had." </p><p> </p><p>"...huh. That sounds creepy." </p><p> </p><p>"I guess." </p><p> </p><p>"So, aside from that, is everything good with your class?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I'm not sure. They started getting agitated around me, but now they're not, so I don't know if they like me or not." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, it's still early in the year, so I guess we'll see. And hey, if anyone causes you problems, tell me and I'll beat them up for you." </p><p> </p><p>"...you shouldn't beat them up." </p><p> </p><p>"Eh, I'm a student, I can get away with it." </p><p> </p><p>"...I don't think that's how it works." </p><p> </p><p>"That's for future Shez to figure out." </p><p> </p><p>"I don't think future Shez likes current Shez."</p><hr /><p>After a nice breakfast, Shez began to walk around the monastery. Morning classes weren't really held on the first day of the month while the professors got their missions for the month, which meant she had plenty of free time. Granted, she didn't really know what to do yet, since her fellow Blue Lions seemed on edge for some reason and she didn't know why. </p><p> </p><p>Part of her felt like it wasn't her place to ask since it seemed like it was a thing with all the Lions, so she gave them some space. Which meant she ended up lost again while walking. </p><p> </p><p>"How'd I end up at the cathedral…" She muttered to herself as she looked around, trying to find someone she knew. "Oh, hey, Lysithea!" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Oh, what do you want?" </p><p> </p><p>"Wanted a bit of help if you don't mind. I was trying to get to the marketplace, but I got lost." </p><p> </p><p>"...How did you get lost? For that matter, how did you not realize that until you got to the cathedral? You had to cross a bridge to get here!" </p><p> </p><p>"I dunno, this place is just way too big." </p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, I'll agree with you there, the monastery grounds are too far spread out. It feels like it takes forever to get to one place from another. N-Not that I get lost like some child!" </p><p> </p><p>"...I didn't call you a child." </p><p> </p><p>"And you shouldn't! I'm a fully capable, mature adult!" </p><p> </p><p>"...Look, can you just help me get back to the marketplace?" </p><p> </p><p>Lysithea scoffed, affronted. “Of course I can! Follow me!”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright.” And so, on Shez went, following after the shorter girl. The much shorter girl, whose legs weren’t as long as hers, so she actually wound up walking slower than she usually would to make sure she didn’t overtake her.</p><p> </p><p>“Y-You don’t have to walk so slowly! I can keep up with you just fine!”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, if you say so.”</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later, Shez jerked as a panting Lysithea tugged at the back of her shirt, stopping her in her tracks. “Why did you go to the stables!?”</p><p> </p><p>Shez blinked, then glanced at Argo, who was staring at her placidly from his stable. “Oh, huh. That’s weird…oh, hey Marianne.”</p><p> </p><p>“...H-Hello?” the blue-haired girl greeted before Lysithea grabbed Shez’s wrist and started pulling her away.</p><p> </p><p>“Honestly! How in the world do you function in your day to day life?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Hey, I’m not that bad! It’s just easy to get turned around here!”</p><p> </p><p>“You walked into the stables! How do you even do that unintentionally?!”</p><p> </p><p>“I was taking a shortcut! Look, the marketplace is right over there, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“THAT’S WHERE THE POND IS! Ugh, follow me, now!”</p><p> </p><p>Shez pouted, but let the shorter girl lead her along before something else caught her attention. “Oh hey!”</p><p> </p><p>“What–Gah!” Lysithea yelped as Shez changed directions, getting dragged along by the taller girl’s sleeve for a moment before she managed to steady herself and walk along with her properly. “Ugh, honestly, what is wrong with you?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing! I just saw–Ah, hey, here we go! Hey Victor! Hey Candace!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Oh, hey Shezzy!” greeted the lean, dirty-blonde lancer with a cheerful, gap-toothed smile across her freckled face, “It’s been a while!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah it has! What’ve you two been up to? I haven’t seen you around at all!”</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve been around here,” Victor answered, the hefty, bald, bearded merc raising a bushy black eyebrow at his captain’s kid, “The captain’s staying here so most of us mercs have just been sticking around since he still pays us ‘n all. You didn’t know?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, uh…yeah, uh, I definitely knew! I was just busy with classes. Heh, you know how it is, not a lot of freetime and all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is that so? Cause Byleth’s been visiting us whenever she gets a chance.” He crossed his arms over his chest, his dark beard hiding the slight grin he had. “Are you saying you get less free time than a professor?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Uh…ah, hey! Meet Lysithea!” Shez deflected, pushing her shorter friend forward.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah-H-Hey, don’t just–...er.” Lysithea gulped, staring up at two of the roughest people she’d ever seen. “...Hello. My name is Lysithea von Ordelia. It’s nice to meet you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! I know that name! Cordelia’s one of the big houses!” Candace exclaimed with a bright smile, earning a sigh from Victor.</p><p> </p><p>“She just said it’s Ordelia. No ‘C’.”</p><p> </p><p>“See what?”</p><p> </p><p>Victor rolled his eyes, before nodding to Lysithea. “Nice to meet you, kid. Good to see Shez is making friends. Speaking of, Shez, good on you for making friends with nobles, it’s good to get those connections.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, I know, but Lysithea is just helping me out right now,” Shez explained, “I was trying to find the weapon shop around here.”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean the armory or the blacksmith?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Uh…” Shez glanced at Lysithea.</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you think I would know–No, actually…the armory should be where you would want to go if you wish to buy equipment directly, while the blacksmith handles specialty work, like repairing weapons and forging special orders.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh wow, you are smart.”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea blinked, before puffing out her chest. “Of course I am! Did you think I wasn’t?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Uh, no, that’s not what I said?” Shez looked confused, before just shrugging and glancing at her mercenary friends. “Well it was good to see you two again. I’ll try to come by and hang out again!”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure thing, Shez. You just do what’s best for you, alright? And make sure people are paying you for whatever work you do,” Victor reminded.</p><p> </p><p>“Bye Shezzy! Say hey to Byleth for me! And have fun with your little friend!” Candace said, earning an affronted look from Lysithea.</p><p> </p><p>“Little?!”</p><p> </p><p>But the blonde mercenary didn’t pay her any mind, instead just ambling off towards one of the vendors, which earned a little laugh from Shez. “Oh, that poor guy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph…What? What do you mean? Are you referring to the bald man?”</p><p> </p><p>“Who, Victor? No, he knows how to handle Candace, he’s fine. I meant the merchant.” Shez grinned as she turned and started heading for the armory, walking slowly so Lysithea can keep in step with her without falling behind again. “Candace is kind of an airhead, except when it comes to three things. The first, any kind of steed; they immediately catch her interest and she adores pegasi especially. The second, actually fighting; she’s probably one of our best spearwomen and she’s cold and efficient when it comes to a fight. And the third, haggling.”</p><p> </p><p>“Haggling?” Lysithea asked dubiously.</p><p> </p><p>“Yup! She gets intense, and Saints help you if she thinks you’re trying to cheat her. I’m pretty sure that Anna girl still holds a grudge,” Shez explained, before stopping herself before she could bump into another familiar face. Which meant Lysithea wound up running into her.</p><p> </p><p>“Gh–Hey, watch it!”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, sorry–”</p><p> </p><p>“O? Well hello Shez and Lysithea,” Dorothea greeted, looking surprised to see them both, “I wasn’t expecting to see you two together. Are you having some kind of outing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, sort of? It’s more Lysithea was helping me find the armory.”</p><p> </p><p>“Against my better judgment,” Lysithea muttered under her breath, though not quietly enough to avoid noticing from Dorothea, who giggled.</p><p> </p><p>“Well it’s very nice of you to lend your aid to our directionally challenged friend!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I’m not that bad,” Shez complained.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh really? So then you weren’t the one who wandered onto the field of the mock battle by complete accident?”</p><p> </p><p>“...That was one time.”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s only been one mock battle,” Dorothea teased, making Shez huff. “Ah, though, I did have one thing I wanted to say the next time I saw you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted to apologize. I, well…I made some rude remarks about your sister the last time we spoke, about how intense she was being.”</p><p> </p><p>“You did?” Shez frowned in thought– “Oh, right, you did! Well, to be fair, I’ve used that word to describe Byleth a few times.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, but you’re her sister. There’s a difference in how you regard her versus how an acquaintance like me does.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez scratched her head, frowning. “Dorothea, are you feeling guilty about something?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, um…h-hm, that was blunt…I suppose. It’s just…she saved Bern and Ferdie so readily. She put herself directly into harm's way to keep them from being hurt and she barely cared that she was wounded in the process…I guess I just feel…shallow after that, for assuming she was just trying to scare us when she genuinely wanted us to be prepared for how dangerous those bandits turned out to be.”</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yeah, Byleth isn't really the type to try and scare people intentionally. She's really blunt but also pretty honest. Though, back up for a moment, what happened with Bernadetta and Ferdinand?" </p><p> </p><p>"Did she not tell you?" Dorothea asked, a bit surprised. "During the mission, some bandits almost got the drop on Bern and Ferdie, and she was hurt saving them. We almost didn't realize she was even stabbed until Bern freaked out." </p><p> </p><p>"...Is that so?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I guess it really wasn't that big of a deal if she didn't mention it to you." </p><p> </p><p>"No, I'm pretty sure it is a big deal, she's just a dumbass sometimes," Shez said, before letting out a sigh. "Thanks for telling me, I'll make sure to talk to her later." </p><p> </p><p>"Well do try and go easy on her. We already made class difficult for her last month, the last thing we need is her getting angry." </p><p> </p><p>"I don't even know if Professor Byleth can get angry," Lysithea said with a huff. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, well, she can. It's not pretty, but it takes a lot to get angry," Shez said before muttering. "Kinda why we didn't want to come here." </p><p> </p><p>"What does that mean?" Lysithea asked. </p><p> </p><p>"It's nothing. Anyways, thanks for telling me Dorothea, see you around." </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, alright. Well, have fun you two!” Dorothea said with a smile, before giving Lysithea a thumb’s up for some reason.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. What was that about?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Who knows? Now I do hope we can be done with your errands already, we’ve wasted enough time as it is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yeah, sorry about that. Well hey, let’s–” Shez paused, mostly because the instant she started walking she wound up colliding with someone. She almost thought it was Lysithea at first, since the person was pretty short, but that didn’t make much sense since Lysithea was standing to her side.</p><p> </p><p>“Eep!” squeaked Bernadetta, holding up the book she just bought like it was a shield. </p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Oh, hey Bern–”</p><p> </p><p>“D-DON’T KILL ME!” </p><p> </p><p>Shez blinked as the short girl promptly fled in the opposite direction, before she seemed to realize that would take her past the gates and instead fled down an alley. “...Huh. Did I do something?”</p><p> </p><p>“Who knows? You’re a tall mercenary who hangs around with ruffians. Not only that, but she’s plainly terrified of your sister. It would almost be a surprise if Bernadetta wasn’t afraid of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. I guess that’s true. Still feels weird though.” Shez tilted her head, thinking. “...I kind of understand why By was chasing her now.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Is this some kind of predatory instinct?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I just want to figure out why she’s afraid of me now. Though I guess she is pretty small and rabbit-like, huh? She probably would be fun to chase…”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Lysithea just sighed before grabbing Shez’s wrist and pulling her along again. Honestly, it was a wonder the distractible girl was able to get anything done.</p><hr /><p>As she stood outside of Rhea’s office, Byleth took a quick breath to steel herself and kept her face even as she entered. Waiting inside for her were Seteth and Rhea, the latter of whom smiled at her. </p><p> </p><p>“Hello there, professor. I see you are eager to start the month off. Why, you’re here even before Professor Hanneman.” </p><p> </p><p>“...I simply felt it would be rude to keep you two waiting for whatever mission my class will get assigned this month.” </p><p> </p><p>“On that we can agree. Do make sure to keep that attitude going forward,” Seteth interjected. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Sure. So what is our mission this time?”</p><p> </p><p>“A lord in the kingdom has apparently begun to raise arms against the church,” Rhea explained, “While the Knights of Seiros will of course handle a majority of the conflict, I want for your class to be a part of the rearguard and assist in the aftermath.” </p><p> </p><p>“I see…” Well, if the knights would be more involved this time, then it would be safer for her students at least. Might be handy to read up on knights tactics to be able to coordinate with them… “What exactly would we need to do to act as the rearguard?” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, war zones are unpredictable, so while we don’t think any of the students will need to be in combat for this mission, there is a chance you may need to deal with any remaining forces that evaded the vanguard. Aside from that, you need only assist if the knights ask for help.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hm… So, we’re only expected to sit back and watch? That sounds odd for a mission.” </p><p> </p><p>“Even so, it is by the will of the goddess that you take this mission. The mission will also be useful in demonstrating to the students how foolish it would be to turn their blades on the church.” </p><p> </p><p>“..” Byleth tried to not let it show how much it unnerved her how easily Rhea was able to say that. “...I see. If I may ask, where exactly in the Kingdom will we be going?”</p><p> </p><p>“To Gaspard territory.” </p><p> </p><p>“...Excuse me? Gaspard territory, as in…Lord Lonato’s territory?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yes, are you familiar with the territory?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I was there, long ago.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hm, well there is no worry if you do not remember the land well. As has been stated, you shall only be part of the Rear Guard. Not to mention you shall be accompanied by members of the knights, including Holy Knight Catherine.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Catherine?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, a fine young knight that I’m sure you will get along with. It was my desire that she meet you here, but as I have said, you arrived early… Would you care to wait a little longer for her to arrive?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Byleth immediately responded, getting Seteth to scowl. “I mean… I really should be getting back to my class, and I would hate to take up any more of your time.” With that, Byleth bowed, before immediately walking out before anyone could say anything else. </p><p> </p><p>“Is everything alright? I have not seen you fidget before…” Sothis noted a bit of worry in her voice as Byleth walked downstairs. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m okay, I’m just…” Clenching her fists to stop them from fidgeting, Byleth tried to ease herself as she tried to ignore the heat swelling up in her. “I think I need to hit something.”</p><hr /><p>After managing to buy a new sword, since her last one had started getting damaged beyond repair, Shez was able to make her way back, mainly due to Lysithea. </p><p> </p><p>"You owe me one for wasting my time!" the young mage said, once they got back to the courtyard leading to their classrooms. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, uh, sure? I don't mind doing a quick job for you if you need it," Shez said, before thinking. "Though if I do a good job, mind telling others about how great I am?" </p><p> </p><p>"...You are very lucky Professor Manuela doesn't mind if we're a bit late to class," Lysithea complained with a huff, before heading off to her class. </p><p> </p><p>"See you Lysithea!" Shez replied, waving her off as she went to her classroom. Well at least there weren't any more weird comments about Lysithea not being a child. Heck, maybe her luck was turning around and she'd have a good mission this month.</p><p> </p><p>"Please tell me you aren't serious, Professor Hanneman!" Was the first thing she heard as she walked in to hear Dimitri yelling. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm afraid I am, Prince Dimitri. That was the mission given to us this month." </p><p> </p><p>"And why were we given that mission instead of the Black Eagles!?" Ingrid said, standing up yelling. </p><p> </p><p>"I am not certain why Lady Rhea has chosen to hand out the missions as she did, but her decision has been made." </p><p> </p><p>"So normally I wouldn't care, but she does see how bad of an idea it is to give Empire students a mission in Kingdom territory, right?" Sylvain asked, his usual mirth not there. </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, I feel like I missed something important," Shez said as she walked in. </p><p> </p><p>"Just what mission we didn't get," Felix scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, did we get another escort mission or something?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, we were asked to deal with bandits but…" Trailing off, Dedue glanced at Ashe. </p><p> </p><p>"...The Black Eagles were assigned to deal with a rebellion that's being led by my father," the young, freckled boy explained. </p><p> </p><p>Shez paused. “...You mean Lord Lonato?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>She slowly nodded, taking in the conflict on her friend’s face, before glancing at their professor. “Professor Hanneman…could you be more specific?”</p><p> </p><p>The professor sighed, looking even older with the clear weariness he felt. “Lord Lonato of House Gaspard has raised a force in an open rebellion against the Church of Seiros. His justification for his actions is his claim that Archbishop Rhea had his son executed under false pretenses. He claims she is a corrupt tyrant who will kill anyone who speaks out against her and must be overthrown. Due to his grievance being with the Church itself, it was decided that the Knights of Seiros would handle his rebellion instead of the Kingdom of Faerghus.”</p><p> </p><p>“And we’re going along with them?”</p><p> </p><p>Hanneman shook his head. “We are not. Our class will be traveling to Siward territory in the Alliance to deal with a group of bandits called–”</p><p> </p><p>“Professor!” Dimitri interrupted, “I must protest this decision! We all know the tensions that exist between the Empire and Faerghus at this time! How will it look to send Imperial nobility, including their princess, to kill a lord of Faerghus?!”</p><p> </p><p>“I am aware of the optics of the situation, Dimitri, but the decision is not mine to make.”</p><p> </p><p>“This is ridiculous!” Ingrid exclaimed, “Are we really going to let Adrestians spill <em> more </em> Faerghan blood!?”</p><p> </p><p>Hanneman sighed. “Ingrid, I would like to remind you of where I happen to come from before you make further remarks like that.” From where she stood, Shez could see Mercedes shift uncomfortably as well. </p><p> </p><p>“Ah–...I am sorry, professor. I let my emotions get the better of me.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s quite alright. I understand this is a tense time for everyone, but we mustn’t let it overwhelm us.”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri straightened, a frown still on his face. “...Professor Hanneman, may I speak to Professor Byleth? Perhaps we could arrange to swap our missions?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think Lady Rhea would accept that…but very well, there is no harm in trying.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, professor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’ll come with,” Shez offered, “It might help out if I’m the one asking with you, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, well…yes, I suppose if you think it will help,” Dimitri agreed, nodding to her before he made his way out of the classroom. To no one’s surprise, Dedue got up too to follow him, prompting a sigh from Hanneman.</p><p> </p><p>“Well I suppose we can just have a free study period for this class.”</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, Shez followed behind Dimitri and Dedue, idly glancing up at the big guy again. “So hey, how are you feeling about all this?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think my opinion especially matters here.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? It definitely does! I’m asking for a reason, right? Besides, uh…Well, I’ll admit I don’t know much about Duscur, but I know what Christophe was accused of.”</p><p> </p><p>Dedue glanced down at her. “Did you know Lonato’s son?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yeah, I did. You know how I knew Ashe already from my dad working for his…ah, yeah, that’s his dad that’s going to…hm.”</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t realize?”</p><p> </p><p>“I did, it just…sort of hit me there. I have kind of a weird relationship with death. A lot of people I cared about died, so I just…don’t care all that much. Except sometimes I think about it and it just suddenly hits me that it still matters. I don’t know, is that weird?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s one way of looking at things,” Dedue answered, “I have my own thoughts on death. It is difficult not to. I find it easier to devote myself to a cause than to dwell though.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I get that.”</p><p> </p><p>Ahead of them, Dimitri struggled not to join in their conversation. He had no place in it, not when he was so directly haunted by the dead. The voices almost felt louder since the mission was given, rising in indignant fury as he found himself wondering, not for the first time, if the Empire really might have been behind the Tragedy…</p><p> </p><p>Though he wouldn’t have a chance to address that concern as he found himself blinking in mild surprise at the sight of a completely empty classroom. “...Er…This is the Black Eagle’s classroom?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Oh, hey, did we get lost?” Why did Shez sound happy about that?</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you sound happy about that?” Why did he ask that…</p><p> </p><p>“Well it shows it’s not just me who gets lost in this huge place!” Shez replied, smiling brightly as Dedue peered past Dimitri into the classroom.</p><p> </p><p>“The banners along the walls are Adrestian. This is the Black Eagle’s classroom.” He decided not to mention it should be impossible to get lost on the way to the classroom in question, given that it was right next to theirs.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw! And here I thought I found a kindred spirit,” Shez grumbled.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…I’m sorry for disappointing you?” Dimitri apologized.</p><p> </p><p>“Nah, it’s fine. Still, where’d they go? Class should still be in session, right?”</p><p> </p><p>"Perhaps professor Eisner took her class somewhere? She might be leading them in a training exercise…" </p><p> </p><p>"Would they have left all their belongings if that was the case?" Dedue pointed out, noting how all their textbooks and such had been left on their desks. </p><p> </p><p>"Was there an emergency?" Dimitri asked, though he doubted there was. Sure, the classroom walls and doors were thick, but surely they would have heard if something was occurring… </p><p> </p><p>"Emergency!" Looking over, the three saw Caspar running around the corner, and nearly crashing into them as he did. "H-Hey, outta the way, I need to get Professor Manuela!" </p><p> </p><p>"Caspar? What happened?"</p><p> </p><p>"Professor Byleth and Jeritza are beating each other up at the training grounds! Now outta the way so I can go get Manuela!" </p><p> </p><p>"What? Dedue, go with him for pro–Shez?" Rushing off before Dimitri could finish speaking, Shez ran toward the training grounds. And it seemed the Black Eagles were there, about five of the students in a crowd watching a fight go down. </p><p> </p><p>"Professor, Jeritza, stand down! This spar is going too far!" Edelgard shouted with a look of genuine concern. Which was reasonable, given the professor and the combat instructor were currently beating the ever-living hell out of one another.</p><p> </p><p>A pair of wooden swords laid discarded and broken on the ground nearby as a brutal blow to the jaw drew blood from a smiling Jeritza, a look of pure glee on what could be seen of the masked instructor’s face. He barely wavered, instead responding with a vicious hook that made Byleth’s head snap to the side, a sight that made Shez flinch, an unintentional noise of genuine distress slipping out that was covered by Byleth screaming in rage and outright tackling Jeritza, bringing him down to the ground and raising her fist to cave his skull in right before a sudden deluge of cold frost rained down on her, sending a shock through her mind and snapping her out of her fury.</p><p> </p><p>“Gh…ah…sorry,” she muttered down to Jeritza, who blinked up at her, his crazed grin still in place before it seemed to twitch.</p><p> </p><p>“...Ah, so you’re not going to continue then,” he murmured, before frowning up at her, “Would you mind getting off of me? I feel this may get awkward for both of us otherwise.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right.” Byleth stood up, brushing some frost from her hair with a sigh. “Sorry Shez–...”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth stared at her students. Her students stared back. So did Shez, who let her hand lower with a sigh of relief, and Dimitri, who was staring with an indescribable look on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth cleared her throat, her face reddening as ducked her head. “...I believe I said you all had a free period.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I…think I can speak for everyone when I say we were curious about what you had planned, professor,” Ferdinand spoke up.</p><p> </p><p>“...Professor, is this about Lonato?” Dorothea asked, prompting a flinch from Byleth that made the songstress’s expression turn from horror to sympathy.</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth took a slow breath. “Class dismissed.”</p><p> </p><p>“But, professor–”</p><p> </p><p>“Class dismissed. I am in a compromised emotional state that has left me unfit for teaching. Class is dismissed.”</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea looked to Shez, who gave her an awkward smile back. “I’ll, uh…yeah, it’s fine, we’ll talk. Catch up with you later?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Alright.” She nodded before glancing at Ferdinand and Petra. “Come along Ferdie, Petra. We should leave things here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Ah, yes, I suppose–Oh, wait, but what about her highness–Ah!”</p><p> </p><p>“Now, Ferdie,” Dorothea insisted while pulling him along by the arm. Petra, meanwhile, studied her professor for a moment before nodding.</p><p> </p><p>“You have much rage, Professor. I have understanding of that sensation. We should be talking later.” </p><p> </p><p>“...Alright.” </p><p> </p><p>Her piece said, she walked off, leaving the professor with two house leaders, her sister, and Hubert, who was doing a pretty good job of being his usual looming self.</p><p> </p><p>“So, uh…” Shez glanced at her house leader, then at her sister’s house leader, then over at her sister. “...Who wants to go first?”</p><p> </p><p>“What was that?” Edelgard asked, deciding she should be first.</p><p> </p><p>“...I have anger issues,” Byleth stated, which made Hubert snort.</p><p> </p><p>“That much is obvious.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard gave him an annoyed look before marching up to her professor. “You know what I mean! You nearly beat Jeritza to death! Why?!”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth grimaced, then paused as she heard Jeritza mutter “if only” under his breath. She decided not to address that at the moment, because…yeah, that was something. “...I wanted to work out my aggression by sparring with Jeritza. I lost my temper. I am…feeling that aggression because I was there when Lord Lonato received the news that his son had been murdered–...When his son had been executed.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not telling me everything,” Edelgard stated, frowning up at her teacher.</p><p> </p><p>“Edelgard!” Dimitri cut in, “Please, Professor Eisner is clearly distressed! You can’t just hound her for answers!”</p><p> </p><p>She glared back at her fellow house leader, then looked back up at Byleth. “...I expect answers later then. It matters to me if your ‘emotional state’ is ‘compromised’.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Later then.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard didn’t look pleased, but she left with Hubert in tow, the dark-haired boy taking a moment to regard the two sisters with open interest before he left. </p><p> </p><p>Dimitri sighed, scratching at his head. “I don’t know how she can be so…Never mind. Are you okay, professor?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine.” She frowned. “Why are you here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…it’s nothing. Er, we can speak later. My apologies for bothering you.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth furrowed her brows as he left, before looking at Shez, who tried to smile back at her. “...Need a hug?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Please.”</p><p> </p><p>The sisters took a moment to hold each other tight, before Shez frowned down at her shorter, older sister. “Is it just about Lonato? I’m sure you would get mad about that, but you looked ready to kill the masked guy over there.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Did you forget his name?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No, no, he’s…” She heard it just a little bit ago, what was it– “Jeritza!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes?” the masked man in question asked, glancing up from where he was picking up the broken equipment.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, nothing, I was just asking my sister why she tried to kill you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah. If you learn the specific reason, please inform me. I would not mind doing this again sometime.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez blinked. “Uh…Wait, are you asking her out?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. I just want to fight her again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay. No offense, I just don’t think you’re her type.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth poked her sister, making her jolt with an indignant noise. “Stop trying to influence my love life.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mn–Well I’m not wrong, am I? Does he look like your type?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have a type.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? Like, no preferences at all?”</p><p> </p><p>“I feel like I should not be present for this conversation,” Jeritza stated, before doing the reasonable thing and just walking off with a slight awkwardness in his step, his busted lip still dripping blood.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I should have healed him,” Byleth realized.</p><p> </p><p>“Ehh…I think he’ll be good. Now c’mon, what’s up? The only person I think ever provoked you into trying to kill them like that was…” Shez trailed off as she noticed a dark expression crossing her sister’s face. “...Oh. She’s back at the monastery, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. Thunder Catherine.” The only person Byleth ever genuinely hated.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…yeah, that’s going to be–”</p><p> </p><p>“EDELGARD! I CAN’T FIND MANUELA, SHE WASN’T AT–Huh?” Caspar blinked, staring in confusion at the much emptier training area. “Uh…hold on, where’d everybody go?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…I guess off to do their own stuff?” Shez offered, before giving Caspar a confused look, “What took you so long anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I was trying to find Manuela, but she’s not in the infirmary! I couldn’t find her at all!”</p><p> </p><p>“...Caspar, I think she’s teaching her class right now,” Byleth said.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Ohhh…Yeah, that would make sense. Huh.” He shrugged. “Well, is everything okay here?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth glanced at her sister, then shrugged. “We’re good.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez frowned a little, but… “Yeah, we’re all good here! Thanks for trying!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no problem! I’m glad it wasn’t something serious!”</p><p> </p><p>Shez glanced at the bruise forming on her sister’s cheek. “Yeah…nothing serious.”</p>

  <p>
  <span>After making sure her sister had healed herself up, and was properly laying down in bed before she left, Shez was off to do the one thing that seemed like the best course of action. That was to, of course, talk to her dad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey dad, you better not be busy!" she shouted, walking into his office, catching him off guard since he was reading some reports.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Mind telling me why you're coming in so loudly?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth and Jeritza almost killed each other cause Byleth met Catherine."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What!?" Pushing himself up out of his seat, Jeralt nearly charged off before Shez stopped him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's…well it's not okay, but they're not fighting anymore and I made sure Byleth was in her room before coming here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Letting out a heavy sigh, Jeralt collapsed into his chair. "That damn Rhea…if I had known she was assigning Catherine to this mission, I would have fought harder to make sure Byleth wasn’t given it…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Speaking of, why exactly are students having to deal with a rebellion? I'm not the best at politics, but it seems like a bad idea based on how the Blue Lions are acting." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Technically, the students are only part of the rear guard, so they shouldn't have to deal with any fighting. Aside from that, Rhea is using this as a way to teach the students not to turn against the church." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So she's just showing off how strong her knights are?" Shez asked, feeling disgusted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Try not to say that so loudly. Last thing we need is to piss someone off," Jeralt said, sighing again. "But that's pretty much it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh…this place continues to be great…just make sure to check on Byleth later, okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I will. Thanks for telling me," Jeralt thanked as he rubbed his head, feeling his age again. "I'll see what I can do with the upcoming mission, okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, thanks." Leaving with a frown, Shez couldn't help but feel restless as she began to make her way down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I must say, I knew your sister was not fond of that knight, but I didn't think this would happen." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not now, Arval." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do not misunderstand me, partner. While I may not like your sister, even I do not wish to see her like this. It may be your destiny to defeat her, but there is nothing to gain from defeating the downtrodden." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...thanks?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do not mention it. Also, that Riegan child is waiting for you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh?" Blinking, Shez saw Claude was indeed at the bottom of the stairs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there, Shez. Heard there was a scuffle?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not up for any banter right now, Claude." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I get it, something bad happened so you're not in the best of moods. But as your friend, I want to check up on you. From what it sounds it was fairly serious." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…how about we head somewhere else so we can talk?" Claude said, before gesturing to her to follow him. "Come on, it'll do you good to have someone to talk to." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Huffing, Shez followed behind him, with the two ending up in the greenhouse, currently devoid of students or gardeners. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, mind telling me what happened?" Claude asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah, well…I don’t remember if I’ve explained this to you yet, but basically a few years ago, my family and I worked for this guy called Lord Lonato, the same one the new mission is about. He’s also Ashe’s adoptive dad, and…well, some of the Knights of Seiros came by his place, I guess looking for evidence. By had a run in with them and…I wouldn’t say she hates all of them or anything, but they put her on edge.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…She must have really liked Lonato then. Or his son?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahh…I can’t really speak for Byleth.” Shez shrugged. “I wasn’t there for it, she kind of just…ran ahead of me and into trouble. It was scary, but she was alive afterwards, so that’s all that matters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude nodded, looking thoughtful. “Well, it’s good to know what set her off…unless there’s more?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re kind of nosy, you know that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He just grinned. “I’ve been told that before, sure. Sorry, it’s just interesting. The rumor mill is working overtime since the news spread that the newest professor and the combat instructor apparently fought until their weapons broke and then started punching each other. It’s almost like something out of a story, you know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not nearly as cool when it’s your own sister involved…” Shez muttered, glancing away from him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, I can understand that. Kind of wish I had siblings like how you have Byleth. Having someone in your corner like that…anyway, it’s not all fun. I actually had a few of my classmates wanting to pass along well wishes to Teach. Leonie and Marianne both wanted me to say they hope she’s okay if I ran into you first, and Lysithea even asked me to check up on you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez sighed. “Not that I don’t appreciate the concern, but could you pass along to Lysithea that I’m not completely helpless? I know I get lost easily but that doesn’t mean I’m hopeless.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, all I said is that she’s worried. As for whether she thinks you’re actually completely incompetent or not, I can’t say, but I’m willing to bet it’s the latter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So she does think I’m competent?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe! Ask her yourself. I think she had fun spending time with you today, so why not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She did? Huh. Bit of a surprise to hear." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well she didn't seem as annoyed as she usually is when mentioning why she was late, so there's that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh what's this, a secret rendezvous in the greenhouse?" A voice Shez didn't recognize caught their attention as the two looked over to see a tanned blond walking into the greenhouse. "Didn't think I'd stumble onto one of these so early into the year."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…" Glancing over, Shez could see Claude studying her for a moment. "Well, she is attractive, though maybe a bit too brash for my tastes." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Shut up Claude," Shez said with a sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, just giving my own thoughts." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha, well if you two do decide to have a rendezvous in the future, I'm gonna warn you, the greenhouse isn't the place for it. People get mad if you accidentally step on any of the plants," the knight said, which, right, she was a knight. "Ah, but if you don't mind me asking, mind telling me if you know where Professor Eisner is?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...why are you asking?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was hoping to have a spar with her, went by her classroom but it was empty, and some students said she dismissed class early?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...She's not feeling well, so she's getting some rest." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, damn it. Was hoping to face off against her. Oh well, I have plenty of time to do so." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We'll make sure to pass on the message, Thunder Catherine." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I'll-...wait, did you say Catherine?" Shez asked, getting Claude to quirk an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That I am, Holy Knight Catherine, and if you're in the Black Eagles class, we'll be working together at the end of the month." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'm in the Blue Lions." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, cool, that was my house back when I was at the academy!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Right, Claude, we can talk later," Shez said, before heading out of the greenhouse, brushing past Catherine without a word to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Did I interrupt something important?" </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Professor, are you awake?" Byleth’s eyes slowly opened as she heard someone knocking on her door. As she got up, she felt a twinge of pain in her jaw and realized she didn’t properly heal herself after her fight with Jeritza. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor it is nearly no– oh, hello" Edelgard cut herself off as the door opened, showing a disheveled looking Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hello, Edelgard." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Professor, are you aware that classes have already started for today?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, sorry, let me get ready," Byleth said, about to close her door so she could make herself look at least a bit presentable before class. Though before she could, Edelgard stopped her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I already took the liberty of telling everyone to have a free study day. That and I have a feeling you may still be emotionally compromised, as you put it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm doing better, I can teach-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, as your student, I do not think it would be wise for you to teach today. Especially if something were to happen to cause you to slip into a state of anger again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I…" No, Byleth couldn't say that wouldn't happen, especially with the mission this month and who'd she be working with… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"See, professor? Your thoughts alone are working you up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Okay, classes can be self-study for today. Did you need anything else?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes actually. I was hoping you'd indulge me in a request." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What would that be?" Byleth asked as she saw Edelgard give her a small smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Would you care to join me for tea?" </span>

  <p>“Huh. The tea tastes different,” Byleth noted after taking a sip, her head tilted curiously at the teacup in her hand, its sides covered in small red flower designs.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard tried not to laugh, though she did let a smile show. “I imagine it would, professor. This is Bergamot. It’s a more citrusy blend compared to the sweeter tea Mercedes and Annette were having.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh…What do you prefer?”</p><p> </p><p>“In general? I suppose I prefer stronger flavors. Bergamot and the Hresvelg Blend are my favorites, though I will admit, it feels a little egotistical to call my family’s particular blend my favorite.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. Did you grow up drinking it?”</p><p> </p><p>“...My elder sister introduced me to it. Perhaps that accounts for some of it. She passed away, so I suppose I associate it with…happier memories.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, I heard about that.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard paused. “You did?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm hm. I mentioned we were in Enbarr a few years ago, right? I remember Victor being upset because he heard the princes and princesses all got sick." Edelgard had a slight  frown at that. "He was really mad at that Duke Aegir person because of it, though he didn’t really like the duke to begin with.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…And Victor would be a member of your father’s mercenaries?”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, I should have mentioned. Do you want me to introduce you two? He’s in town right now with the others.”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps another time. I am a little curious as to why he holds such strong opinions towards matters regarding the Empire though.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s because he came from the Empire. From Hrym specifically, so he doesn’t like Duke Aegir because of what happened to Hrym, and he doesn’t like him even more because of how he led the Insurrection.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…I suppose it didn’t occur to me that a mercenary would…Hm.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth watched Edelgard think for a moment, then took another sip of her tea. There was a citrus taste to it, though she couldn’t really place what fruit it tasted the most like… “Mm. I think part of it is that Victor likes kids, so he didn’t like imagining what happened. Ezra, another mercenary, calls him a ‘soft heart in the body of a brute’.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s lips twitched in sudden amusement. “They sound like quite the characters. Though we should probably get back on topic.”</p><p> </p><p>“About the tea?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, not about the tea. About you, professor.” Edelgard settled back. “We need to discuss your anger issues.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I guess we do, yeah.” Byleth took another sip of her tea, taking note that the warmth was pretty relaxing. Combined with the nice setting and the small pastries that were available, it was pretty obvious that the princess was trying to get her relaxed for this talk. It wasn’t a bad move and she could appreciate the gesture. “What do you want to talk about then?”</p><p> </p><p>“I would like to hear, in your own words, where this aggression comes from.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. I told you about Lonato. I didn’t mention that the Knights of Seiros came to his house and started ransacking it so they could find evidence of his son’s ‘treason’.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t believe it was treason.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t. I don’t know why the church killed him, but I think they lied about the reason.”</p><p> </p><p>“I understand. What happened with the knights?”</p><p> </p><p>“I found one named Gael keeping Lord Lonato and his children, the two youngest, in one room. Lonato was my employer and I didn’t know who the knights were, so I drew my sword and told him to let the lord go.” She took a slow breath, trying to soothe the fire in her body before it could grow. “I realize that it was foolish of me, in hindsight. He was a grown man and I was still short at sixteen. He was in full plate and I wasn’t dressed for battle. It didn’t matter, because I was supposed to keep Lonato and his kids safe since he was the client.</p><p> </p><p>“Thinking back…I know Gael didn’t want to actually hurt anyone. He told off another knight for trying to attack me, and I think he was trying to get me out of the house and away from the other knights so they wouldn’t try to kill me. It’s hard to tell though. We were negotiating, in a sense, when…” She took another breath and loosened her grip on the teacup so she wouldn’t break it. “Thunder Catherine smashed her shield into me. She also disarmed me of my sword. It happened quickly, and she held me at sword point. I think she was going to kill me. She was willing to and protested when Gael told her to leave me alone.</p><p> </p><p>“Then Lonato saw her and called her a murderer because he realized she killed his son. I don’t know exactly what happened, but he was sure of it and she reacted like she did. So I don’t know why she was there. The only thing I could think of was that she wanted to hurt him further. To mock him with his son’s death, maybe. I don’t know if that’s true, and I can’t be sure. Not unless I actually interact with her, and I don’t…think that would be a good idea.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why not?” Edelgard asked, and Byleth blinked at the immediate response.</p><p> </p><p>“...Because I think I would try to kill her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Are your emotions really that out of control? I find that hard to believe, given how you usually are.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I know. I’m…I don’t know why I’m like this. Emotions are difficult for me. I can tell what other people are feeling, I’m not oblivious, it’s just that my own emotions don’t come up easily. Everything is…muted. It helps to look at Shez and see how she feels about things to understand how I’m supposed to react, but I just don’t feel things strongly. Except for anger, apparently.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…Was that time with Lonato and Catherine the first time you felt anger that extreme?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>"And have you felt it since?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, I… there are times where I feel irritated, it gets easy to slip into that feeling. But I thought I had a handle on those emotions." She let out a sigh. "Guess I was wrong." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm… Professor, this might just be my assumption, but it seems that the problem doesn't just stem from your anger, but the rest of your emotions being unable to balance you. It is easy to focus on one thing, unintentionally or not, if it seems that much bigger than the rest."  </p><p> </p><p>"...So am I just supposed to live with this then?" Byleth asked as she stared at the tea.</p><p> </p><p>"..." Staring at the mercenary before her, Edelgard remained silent. It was…different seeing her like this. From the stoic mercenary, to one full of anger and now to one who looked so very vulnerable. She hadn’t known the professor for long, but it felt wrong for her to be like this. </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard let out a small sigh as she prepared herself. "In the past, there was someone who hurt me deeply. I hated him more than I ever thought I could hate someone else. And then one day, he died." Seeing the cup in her hands trembling, she set it down. "In the moment, I felt relieved that he was finally gone. Yet afterwards…despite what I felt, I realized I would never find closure.</p><p> </p><p>"I may be unable to understand your anger, but I can say this much. If you don't face your problems, you will never be able to grow past them." </p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth slowly nodded. “You’re right. Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t need to thank me. Just resolve your issue. I’m getting tired of all these ‘free study’ periods.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, I need to rethink my lesson plan. We’re behind now. Hm…I’ll think about it later. For now, do you know where Catherine is?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I’m not sure why you think I would.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, alright. I assumed you would. You seem well-informed.” She glanced over to the bushes. “Hubert, do you know where Catherine is right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” There was a faint noise like an aggrieved sigh, before Hubert stepped out from his cover with a faint frown. “You knew I was there the whole time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. I live with Shez. I need to keep situationally aware because she doesn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>That prompted a slight smile. “Well, that I can fully understand.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I resent whatever implication you are making there, Hubert,” Edelgard chided.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean you, your highness. Regardless, you should be able to find Thunder Catherine at the Knight’s Hall. She appears to spend most of her time either there or at the training yard.”</p><p> </p><p>“Understood. Thank you, Hubert. And thank you for the tea and advice, Edelgard,” Byleth said as she stood.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome, professor,” Edelgard replied, “Would you like to do this again sometime?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked, a brief look of surprise crossing her face before she nodded. “Sure. Just ask me whenever and I’ll be up for it.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard smiled and waved off the professor, watching her leave before she glanced up at Hubert. “That went well.”</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose. I didn’t realize I’d been so obvious though.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think it wasn’t obviousness on your part so much as skill on hers. And she is quite skilled. Not to mention driven, thoughtful, and loyal.”</p><p> </p><p>“And she has a grudge against the knights. You know, you could have allowed that grudge to fester instead of resolving it. It would have made for a decent lever to push her with.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need someone blinded by rage on my side, Hubert. You saw how she was with Jeritza. That type of fury would make her a liability.”</p><p> </p><p>“True enough, I suppose. Jeritza on his own can already be quite the handful." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, well I suppose we should go back and tell the others that she'll be teaching again on Monday." </p><p> </p><p>"She is quite the lucky one to not have to worry about Sundays," Hubert mused as he followed behind his liege to the classrooms. It seemed the rest of the class was just as restless as the professor was as when they arrived they found none of them studying, and in fact several coming up to her. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Edie, is everything okay with the professor?" Dorothea asked, concern evident on her face </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, she's not still hurt cause I wasn't able to find Manuela yesterday, right?" A small bit of guilt was evident in Caspar’s voice. A curious change from his usual boisterousness. </p><p> </p><p>"She's doing fine,” Edelgard reassured, “The professor is simply attending to personal matters for today, but she can get back to teaching on Monday." </p><p> </p><p>"May I be offering that we do something for her?" Petra asked, equally worried for their teacher. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I would hate for our professor to end up like that again. Perhaps we should ask her if she needs assistance with anything when she gets back?" Ferdinand mused.</p><p> </p><p>"We'll have to wait and see when she returns," Edelgard said, heading to her seat. "For now, let's just make sure we don't get too far behind."</p><p> </p><p>"U-u-um… the professor isn't m-mad at us, r-right?" Bernadetta managed to squeak out, before trying to sink into her chair as Edelgard looked over at her. </p><p> </p><p>"I think we would be hard pressed to make her mad at us." </p><p> </p><p>"Her sister on the other hand, not so much," Lindhart cut in, getting Bernadetta to squeak. "She was quite offended that I asked for a lock of the Professor's hair to study." </p><p> </p><p>"...Lin, that sounds weird,” Dorothea pointed out. </p><p> </p><p>"The professor didn't think so. She cut off some of her hair there and then for me." </p><p> </p><p>"...I shouldn't have to say this, but don't ask the professor for her hair," Edelgard muttered, getting no response from him as he focused on his book. </p><p> </p><p>"...Well, speaking of hair, I did want to ask you something, Edie," Dorothea said. </p><p> </p><p>"And that would be?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, you know how I asked if you would go into town with me? Do you think we should ask the professor to go with us? It feels like I should make it up to her after how we were last month." </p><p> </p><p>"And what exactly does that have to do with hair?" </p><p> </p><p>"The place I wanted to go to is a hairstylist! And they apparently have some cute accessories too, and, well, no offense to the professor, but she definitely seems like the type to need help when it comes to fixing up her hair." </p><p> </p><p>The professor’s hair did tend to be quite loose and messy… “Very well then. I’m sure the professor wouldn’t mind being invited along.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes! Aw, you’re the best, Edie!”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard smiled at the praise, even as she couldn’t help but wonder what Dorothea would think of her if she knew just how many dark deeds she had already committed. And how many more she was planning to commit…</p><hr /><p>Catherine, wielder of the Thunderbrand and Holy Knight of Seiros, didn’t usually have a lot of downtime. She normally had duties to attend to or tasks to handle that would keep her busy for weeks or even months at a time, so just being back at the monastery without anything to do until the next mission was making her restless. She never liked sitting still, ever since she had to sit through tea parties as a little noble girl needing to learn etiquette. </p><p> </p><p>It didn’t help that the mission coming up for her was…a complicated one.</p><p> </p><p>She let out a slow sigh as she stared up at the ceiling, laying back on a couch in the lounge. One leg was propped up on her knee and her arms rested behind her head, forming a sort of pillow as she just… She believed in Lady Rhea, more than anything. She still saw Lonato’s face in her mind though, perfectly recalling the moment when he realized she was the one who sold out Christophe.</p><p> </p><p>She should have listened to Captain Gael and stayed away, but–</p><p> </p><p>“Thunder Catherine.” Oh? That was a new voice.</p><p> </p><p>Catherine glanced over at the woman standing beside the couch, taking note of her teal hair and cobalt eyes, before she shifted to sitting up in one swift motion, her feet on the floor as she raised an eyebrow at the woman wearing a gray coat over a black and pink top. “Yeah? If you’re looking for me, you found me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I heard you were looking for me.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Oh! Yeah, that’s right! You must be the new professor then!” She grinned as she pushed herself up from the couch, her grin getting wider when she noticed the new professor was shorter than her. “So you’re the one everybody’s been talking about! Heh, I must’ve missed you earlier, I was planning to introduce myself after you got the mission from Lady Rhea.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman just nodded. “Is it Thunder Catherine or Dame Catherine? I don’t want to be impolite.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Not exactly what I expected you to say, but alright. Thunder Catherine isn’t really a proper title, but I like it better than ‘Dame’. You can just call me Catherine though, I don’t need a title.”</p><p> </p><p>“Understood.” Wow, this girl had a really dull voice. It was hard to tell if she was just like this naturally, or if she was holding herself back for some reason. </p><p> </p><p>“You know you don’t need to be so stiff around me, right? I’m just interested in the new professor everybody is talking about.” She let her smirk get a bit sharper. “I want to know why Lady Rhea seems to think you deserve special treatment. I can’t really see why, considering you don’t seem to be anything more than a skilled mercenary, and I’ve seen better than you before.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Four years ago, my father was employed by Lord Lonato of House Gaspard. I worked for him too,” the woman said in the same completely flat tone even as Catherine’s eyes widened, “I attempted to defend him from the knights I saw ransacking his house, and you blindsided me before holding me at swordpoint and threatening to kill me.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Huh.” Now that Catherine looked, really looked, she could see the resemblance between the girl she encountered then and the woman that was facing her now. She worked her jaw, thinking about the kid that stared up at her back then. The hair and eyes were the same. “...Guess the Goddess does work in strange ways. Do we have a problem?”</p><p> </p><p>“I have a problem with you, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh huh. It seemed like it. You’re being pretty stiff there, professor.” Catherine grinned, though the smile didn’t reach her eyes this time. “If you joined up looking for vengeance, I have to say, I admire your commitment.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman shook her head, her eyes never leaving Catherine’s. “I never wanted to come here. Lady Rhea insisted. She also insisted I teach. I don’t mind that. It’s been tricky, but not too bad so far. I don’t mind the other knights either, so you don’t have to worry about that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who said I’m worried?”</p><p> </p><p>“My name is Byleth Eisner. You didn’t ask for it. That’s rude.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Heh. Well you did distract me with this talk about you holding a grudge. So, Eisner, what should I expect here? Are you going to sabotage the mission against Lonato?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. A mission is a mission.”</p><p> </p><p>Catherine frowned, staring into the other woman’s eyes. “...You really mean that, huh? Well, aren't you heartless.”</p><p> </p><p>That broke through whatever calm facade Eisner was trying to put up. And while she wouldn’t admit it outloud, Catherine felt a jolt up her spine at the sudden, hate-filled glare the professor gave her. She’d been on the receiving end of a lot of glares in her life, the worst probably being Lonato’s on that fateful day, but even that paled in comparison to the sheer murderous rage in Byleth’s gaze.</p><p> </p><p>This woman genuinely wanted her dead.</p><p> </p><p>Then it was gone in an instant as the professor regarded her with a calm that had to be forced. “...You wanted a spar, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I was asking for one, sure. Though I’m not sure I should go for one when you look like you want to tear my head off with your bare hands.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think that’s a very good reason why we should have a spar. I have issues with anger where you are concerned and I almost killed a coworker because of it. I would like to work things out in a controlled environment so I won’t do that again.”</p><p> </p><p>It was hard to tell if that was meant to be a threat or if Eisner honestly believed she’d be less agitated after a spar. Catherine had her doubts, because anger like that didn’t just disappear after one fight, but… “Alright, if you insist. Just don’t think I’ll let you kill me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t planning to.”</p><p> </p><p>Catherine huffed in some amusement, but kept her eyes on the shorter woman as she led the way towards the training yard. “I’m surprised you’re letting me follow behind you. Wouldn’t you want to keep your enemy in sight?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a knight. You’re not supposed to be cowardly enough to attack an unaware opponent.”</p><p> </p><p>Her grin twitched. “You know, most people raising a blade towards a Knight of Seiros would have been put to death for it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m aware. I wasn’t then, but I am now.”</p><p> </p><p>“So what’s this supposed to be then?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s what I said. I want to fight you to work off this anger.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t expect me to believe that.”</p><p> </p><p>Eisner stopped and looked back at her. “Catherine, I need to do this. Either I fight you in a controlled environment, or I allow this feeling to fester and risk losing control of myself at a moment that could harm my students or my family. I would prefer the former over the latter.”</p><p> </p><p>“And how’s fighting me going to help? Is this really just to blow off steam?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. It will help. Please accommodate my needs at this time. We are both working for the monastery, so I would prefer our relationship be cordial.”</p><p> </p><p>“But that’s just it. This is just a job to you, isn’t it? You don’t have any real loyalty to the Church or to Lady Rhea.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I don’t want to talk to you, Catherine. I want to fight you. Let’s do that at the training yard, in a spar.”</p><p> </p><p>“And what if I wanted to fight you here and now?” she asked, placing her hand on the hilt of her sword.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a stupid idea. We’re in the middle of the monastery and there are staff and students around.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I could finish things without getting any of them hurt.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth stared at Catherine. “...I see.”</p><p> </p><p>Then she turned and started walking for the training field again. </p><p> </p><p>Catherine frowned as the woman turned her back on her. She could easily pull Thunderbrand free and cut down the potential threat in front of her…but, then, an honorable knight didn’t strike down an unaware opponent.</p><p> </p><p>“Cheeky bitch,” Catherine muttered under her breath as she followed the new professor the rest of the way. </p><p> </p><p>“Hello Professor Byleth,” greeted Jeritza as the two arrived, and Catherine couldn’t help but stare at the combat instructor actually greeting someone politely, “Have you come by for another spar?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Jeritza. I have, but I was planning to spar with Catherine this time. Can we use the field?”</p><p> </p><p>Jeritza glanced at Catherine. The tall, thin guy stared, as though sizing her up, before apparently disregarding her in favor of looking back at Byleth. “Are you certain? I would be a better opponent for your needs.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Catherine wasn’t sure if she should be offended. And was a little confused by what was going on here.</p><p> </p><p>“...No thank you. I would prefer to spar with Catherine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Perhaps later then? I did enjoy our previous time together.” Okay, now Catherine wasn’t sure if “sparring” was supposed to be a euphemism or not.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe? I’m just going to fight Catherine for now though. Thanks for the offer.”</p><p> </p><p>“Very well. I am here if you change your mind,” he said, before walking off.</p><p> </p><p>“...Are you okay?” Catherine asked once he was far enough away, “He seemed kind of pushy there.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked at her. “...Uh…Yes, I’m fine. Jeritza’s okay. I don’t mind him.”</p><p> </p><p>“You sure? That just seemed…” Catherine trailed off, remembering who Byleth happened to be. Though…still. “I’m just saying, if he seems like he’s coming on too strong…”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Yeah, okay.” She regarded Catherine with an odd look, one that was hard to discern with her dull gaze. “Jeritza was the one I almost killed. I’m not sure why he wants to spar again after that.” She looked over at the instructor, then shrugged. “I don’t think it’s my place to say. We should get our swords ready.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, alright.” And soon enough, Catherine was facing off against the newest professor, her hands on the dulled broadsword in her grip. </p><p> </p><p>Eisner stood across from her, one hand on her own sword, her other hand free. It wasn’t a duellist’s pose, so…maybe she left the other hand free for casting? It was hard to be sure, but there was no unease in her stance. The woman really was practiced at this sort of thing.</p><p> </p><p>“This is a foolish idea,” muttered Sothis in Byleth’s head, “You can’t be sure you’ll really hold back in a fight, not with this fury bubbling beneath your skin.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth merely took a slow breath, before nodding to Catherine, affirming that she was prepared.</p><p> </p><p>“Ready?” Jeritza asked, acting as the referee. Not that either woman really thought he’d step in if things looked like they were escalating. Which was reasonable, because he wouldn’t. He would, however, raise his hand and lower it swiftly to start the march, as requested. “Begin.”</p><p> </p><p>Neither swordswoman hesitated. Both rushed forward in a series of swift strikes to test the other’s mettle. There was no wavering in their steps nor their swings, and Catherine felt an unintended grin spread over her face as she gained a sense for how the other woman fought.</p><p> </p><p>While it annoyed her to admit it, Eisner definitely was skilled. There was strength behind her blows, despite mostly keeping to one hand, and she had a strong awareness of her surroundings. The moves she made were quick and efficient as she pressed her attack, but, what was probably the most interesting part to Catherine, she wasn’t going for any cheap shots.</p><p> </p><p>For someone who harbored a grudge against her, the professor was fighting Catherine like this genuinely was a spar. There were no sudden attacks, no aiming for her head or eyes, and the one time she suddenly thrust her hand forward as though she were going to cast, she pulled it back with a frown on her face, the motion clearly done on reflex instead of intentionally.</p><p> </p><p>Catherine didn’t even press her advantage at that misstep, instead taking the moment to disengage and examine the other woman, who looked barely winded from their exchange. Byleth wasn’t even sweating yet, and that honestly made Catherine want to fight all the harder. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on, you can come at me harder than that,” she encouraged, not even caring to hide her grin.</p><p> </p><p>“...I suppose I can,” Byleth replied, before lunging in with a sudden thrust that Catherine deflected.</p><p> </p><p>More thrusts were soon to follow, clearly aimed at pushing Catherine back, so the knight instead stepped in close and responded with a heavy swing to knock the professor off balance. Byleth didn’t falter for long though, moving with the motion to swing hard at Catherine’s shoulder. Easy enough to block, and then it was back to exchanging blows as Catherine pressed her attack, cutting quicker and quicker.</p><p> </p><p>The professor was good, that much was clear, but Catherine liked to think she was better. She was a genuine swordmaster, after all, and she started putting a bit more “oomph” into her swings. Faster, sharper cuts kept Byleth on the defensive, her grip on her sword adjusting to compensate before another heavy swing sent her skidding back.</p><p> </p><p>But Catherine didn’t let up, moving straight into the professor’s guard and keeping up with her onslaught. She actually felt kind of impressed to see Byleth hold her own. Not once had Catherine’s blade actually connected with the professor’s body. She always moved out of the way just in time or brought her sword up to block, preventing any real damage to herself as the fight dragged on.</p><p> </p><p>Even still, she wasn’t invincible, and Catherine smirked to see a bead of sweat rolling down the side of Byleth’s head. She thrusted her sword forward, deliberately overextending as her blade scraped against Byleth’s, holding it back yet leaving Catherine open if the former mercenary wanted to punch her. And, to her amusement, the professor did try to swing for her, which meant it was fully fine for Catherine to block that blow with her arm, leaving only one hand on her sword, before aiming a kick for the professor’s side.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth’s eyes widened and she brought up her knee to block, falling for the feint and letting Catherine yank her sword back before driving it into the professor’s sternum. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe a little too hard, given Catherine actually knocked Byleth to the ground there. “Ah, crap, are you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Ow.” Byleth replied, laying flat on the ground. She moved her hand to her chest, massaging the spot where Catherine landed her hit. “That hurt more than I expected.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, a training sword is still a weapon. Just be glad it wasn’t a real one or we probably wouldn’t be talking now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am aware.” She lifted her head. “You’re good.”</p><p> </p><p>“Heh. Well, not to brag, but I am one of the top Knights of Seiros for a reason.” Catherine crouched down beside the fallen professor. “So…how are you feeling now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Better. I would have lost to you if we had fought for real years ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“...And that thought makes you feel better?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not that thought specifically. It’s just…Why did you go to Lonato’s?”</p><p> </p><p>Catherine sighed. “...It’s stupid. I was stupid. I can’t say I’m much better these days, but back then, I was so stupidly sure of myself that when…Well, after what happened with Christophe, I thought I could actually make things right. I thought I could apologize and make him understand why things had to be the way they did. And I didn’t think for a second that explaining I’m the reason his son is dead would set him off. Stupid, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Extremely, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Catherine snorted, then gave Byleth a glance. “So are you just naturally that dull-voiced? Or are you still holding back some anger?”</p><p> </p><p>“My voice is naturally like this. And I'm also holding back some anger," she responded, getting up. "I'm still angry at you for what you did, but I'm angry at myself for not being strong enough." </p><p> </p><p>"It was just a spar, you know." </p><p> </p><p>"And you would have been much stronger if you used that sword of yours," Byleth said, staring directly at Catherine. "I still have a long way to go before I can pay you back for blindsiding me."</p><p> </p><p>"Not sure if I should take that as a threat or not." </p><p> </p><p>"Take it as you will." Catherine had to admit that, unintentionally or not, the young professor could get under her skin. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you done sparring?" Jeritza asked, coming up to the two. "Would you not want to cross blades with me again?" </p><p> </p><p>"Jeez, Jeritza, you really have to work on your game. Pretty sure there are better ways to flirt with someone than to just ask them to fight you." And that got both of them to stare blankly at Catherine. "...What?" </p><p> </p><p>"Perhaps another time," Jeritza said before leaving. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I'll see you later Catherine," Byleth said as she left as well.</p><p> </p><p>"Starting to think I misread that…" Granted, she also didn't really know the combat instructor that well. He tended to keep to himself so the only thing she knew was that apparently he was referred to the academy by the Prime Minister of the Empire. Still, he wasn't the main interest at the moment. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn't sure what to make of the new professor. She was skilled, definitely above the average merc, but even if this was a serious fight Catherine was sure she'd be able to win. Even so, there was something off about her. Nothing she had seen there had told her why Lady Rhea had hired her, but… normally Catherine was able to figure out what crest someone had, especially after a fight, yet for whatever reason, she couldn't tell anything about the professor's crest. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm definitely gonna have to keep an eye on her…" </p>

She's got a lot more tricks up her coat sleeves than just swordplay.</p><p>Indi: As is, that didn't happen, partially cause Catherine misread what was going on their with Jeritza and cut some of the tension, but mostly cause of Edelgard’s words.</p><p>Red: Yup! So things haven't gone completely horribly, yet.

  <span>"There you are, Professor!" Dorothea greeted the approaching blue-haired mercenary as she and Edelgard waited for her by the monastery gates. "I was starting to wonder if you weren't going to be able to show up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry, Dimitri wanted to know if he could talk with me, but I let him know I had to go to town first." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… I wonder if it has to do with the mission this month…" Edelgard guessed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey now, none of that, today's one of our days off, so none of that serious talk!" Dorothea cut in, before beginning to push the two out of the monastery. "You need to properly rest and relax to be at your best! Isn't that right, professor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, yeah. Pushing yourself too far can be bad." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"See? Professor’s orders that we take it easy!" Dorothea said with a smile. "Hence why we're going to a hairstylist! It’s the perfect place to sit down, relax, and share some gossip~" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are we doing?" Byleth asked, having not actually asked before why the two had wanted her to accompany them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Getting our hair cut and styled of course! No offense professor, but you definitely need it. It almost looks like you cut off your own hair with a dagger or something." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I do," Byleth answered completely sincerely. "Sometimes I ask Shez to do it, but I cut my hair when it's getting too long." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Professor, you really need to take better care of your hair. After all, how are you going to charm anyone like that? Though I guess the rough and gruff type might help you charm someone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why are people so interested in my love life?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me, professor?" Edelgard decided to speak up, not wanting to be completely left out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez keeps trying to influence it, Sylvain asked if I kissed any guys or girls, even Catherine thought Jeritza was trying to flirt with me, and then there was that time with Manuela when I found her drunk…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooo! Now that’s what I meant when I mentioned gossip, that all sounds very interesting!” Dorothea cheered, before giving the professor a sideways glance, “Though, I have to ask, what exactly happened with Manuela, professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Curiously, and to the immediate fascination of both girls with her, Byleth actually turned a little pink as she glanced to the side. “Ah…she gave me some advice about not getting with men who can’t ignore ‘a little mess’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Is that all?” Dorothea asked, her curiosity piqued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I think if I mention anything else, it will be embarrassing for Manuela.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, the fact that you’re not mentioning anything else leaves far too much room for people to get the wrong idea,” Edelgard explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s less of what she said and more the lack of clothes she had on when she said it.” Both Eagles paused at the mental image that presented, before they independently decided they would never mention that part to anyone else for the sake of Professor Manuela’s dignity. Byleth, meanwhile, continued, still faintly blushing. “She also said I was pretty, which felt nice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Are you not used to compliments, professor?” Dorothea asked, getting her thoughts back in order quickly enough to respond.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not really. Not about my appearance, at least.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then it makes perfect sense for us to make today about your appearance! You really are beautiful already, professor, so just think of how you’ll look after a trim! Hm, and perhaps after, we could see what makeup and clothes would work best–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t we focus on one thing at a time, Dorothea?” Edelgard suggested, noticing that Byleth looked a little overwhelmed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you insist, Edie, though you can’t tell me you wouldn’t want to see our professor dressing up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have a feeling you and I have very different ideas of what it would mean to ‘dress her up’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why Edie, you can’t think I would try to take advantage of our poor professor! Besides, shopping for lingerie should be saved for at least the second date.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Um…what?” Byleth asked, starting to feel…odd about this outing. Not bad, exactly, just…Hm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea just giggled though, which didn’t help. “Nothing, professor~! Now come along, the stylist is just up here, and then we can get to sharing all those interesting details about the people invested in your love life~!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Dread was an emotion Byleth didn’t feel often, but as she saw Dorothea’s eager smile and felt Edelgard’s considering gaze, she was pretty sure that was the exact emotion she felt at the moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she actually sat down in the barber’s chair and it turned out to be surprisingly cozy. Having her hair brushed felt nice and brought back memories of when she was small and her dad would try his best to take care of her naturally long and messy hair. Usually to little effect, but it was the thought that counted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Soooo~?” And then Dorothea spoke up again and that feeling returned. “Come on, professor, you can’t talk about how interested people are in your love life and then not tell us anything about it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard glanced over at the two, not saying anything as she sat back for her own trim. Mostly because she was somewhat curious too, even if she wouldn’t admit it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. I know you talk to Shez. You’ve probably already heard everything from her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve heard a few things, certainly, but there’s a big difference between hearing things secondhand and firsthand,” Dorothea explained with a teasing smile, “Besides, is it a bad thing that your little sister wants you to be happy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not. I like how much she cares. It’s just kind of annoying sometimes. Shez likes to push things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I seem to recall a conversation we had where you said a push could be what someone needs,” Edelgard noted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I did say that,” Byleth admitted, “I think there’s a difference between a professor doing it and a sister doing it though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There certainly is, in that it is a younger sister’s prerogative to needle her elders about their love lives.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea giggled at the expression on her professor’s face, before deciding to have mercy and move along. “As for the other people interested in your love life, do feel free to slap Sylvain the next time he tries to involve himself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because he’s a cad, professor. An incorrigible flirt with no real care for those he tries to woo. A rake and a roustabout, as the songs say.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There are songs about Sylvain?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There are songs about the type of man he is. I imagine he tried to ask about any attraction you might have towards men as a prelude to his own advances.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…No, not really. I think he was just curious.” Byleth shrugged. “He seemed fine with me being uninterested.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? I have to say, I find that hard to believe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shrugged again. “It’s what happened. I remember Raphael asked him if he liked men and he said he just likes ‘pretty people’. Oh, and Sylvain offered to be my wingman before that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, that’s completely inappropriate,” Edelgard chided, “He shouldn’t be making offers like that, especially considering your position.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh I completely agree, Edie,” Dorothea agreed, “He would be a terrible wingman. Now, if you happened to need a wingwoman–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dorothea!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Joking~!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I still don’t know what that is,” Byleth admitted, “I even asked some of my father’s mercenaries and they didn’t have any answers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They didn’t?” Dorothea said, looking curious, “I would think a group of hardened mercenaries would be well aware of such things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm…to be specific, when I asked, Ezra just choked and started coughing, Gertrude started laughing, Victor said he’d tell me when I was older, and Candace just patted me on the head, for some reason. So I think they do know, it’s just none of them are helpful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Would those be the officers of Jeralt’s mercenaries?” Edelgard asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I guess? They’re the ones that tend to be giving orders to the rest of them. I don’t think my papa–my father really assigned official ranks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That sounds disorganized.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It usually works fine. I think other mercenary groups just have one leader directing things. It’s kind of like that with us, but…I don’t know. I know I’m going to take over when my father retires though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? You plan to inherit the family business then?” Dorothea asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I…Hm. I guess this professor thing does throw that plan off. I’m not sure I would put Shez in charge though. She’s good at fighting and she can lead small groups, but she’s really bad at navigation and she’s not that good at tactics. I think she’s comfortable just being a mercenary, though I know she wants to be the best she can be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…How did you and Shez meet?” Edelgard asked, “You said before that you shot her with an arrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well. I hadn’t heard this story,” Dorothea said, looking at her professor with some surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yeah. I was hunting for food and I didn’t notice her. I was…I think thirteen at the time. I brought her back to camp because I knew my father could help with things, and then Shez just stuck around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh. And…how old was she when this happened?” Edelgard inquired.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez said she was twelve, but my father thought she was ten. That didn’t stop her from insisting she was the same age as me or older until a month ago when Manuela pointed out she looks closer to your age than mine.” Byleth glanced at Edelgard, her expression completely serious. “She was devastated.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…see.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea giggled. “Poor Shezzy. She really looks up to you, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh. I didn’t really think of it like that,” Byleth admitted, “I think it’s more that she’s competitive though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She can’t be both? Competition and admiration don’t have to be exclusive, you know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess. So, how much longer does this haircut stuff take?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh I’ve been done for a while,” the hairdresser admitted, “You just asked for a basic trim to clean things up. I was just letting you girls chat since you seemed invested.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Uh…well, thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with that all done, Byleth was greeted with her brand new hairstyle! Which…well, was basically her usual one, it’s just her hair looked a lot straighter and smoother and some of the messier parts were cut down. “Huh. I look nice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You certainly do!” Dorothea praised, “Ah, but before we go!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked as Dorothea suddenly put a pink headband on her head. “...Huh. What’s this for?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought it would look cute on you! And it certainly does! Right Edie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard paused at being addressed, before taking note of the professor’s new accessory. “...I suppose it does go well with your hair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t it? And I did notice you seem to like pink from the highlights of your outfits, so why not try adding a little more color to your wardrobe?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, okay,” Byleth agreed, idly checking herself in the nearby mirror. The headband did look cute…And it was a gift. So…why not?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, what next?” Dorothea asked, “We have the rest of the day free, don’t we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True…I heard there was a shop for sweets. We could go there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sounds like a plan! What do you think, Edie?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…I suppose I can indulge myself a little," Edelgard responded, not wanting to make it obvious she was excited for it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In that case, why not indulge us about your love life on the way~? It’s only fair now that the professor has shared~." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There really isn't much to say," Edelgard admitted. "The most would be offers for an arranged marriage, not that any were accepted." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I suppose that's one thing you can look forward to for the year Edie~ I can see it now, the future emperor and the love she meets while at the academy, and all the trials they face together! It sounds like something out of a play, if you do say so myself~" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yes, I suppose it does," Edelgard quietly responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What about you, Dorothea?" Byleth asked as they arrived at the sweets shop. "You seem popular." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm~ I suppose I am, of course I haven't met anyone worth mentioning. Most of the nobles I've met are far from tolerable personality-wise and the knights I've dated are far more interested in just saying they went out with a famous diva then coming back for another date." Dorothea frowned as she spoke. "Why, I once met with one who was just trying to get tickets to the opera so he can take his actual fiance." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow. That’s rude.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t it? If that was all he wanted, he could have just asked instead of trying to string me along like some doe-eyed schoolgirl.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned. “Do you want me to talk with him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Ah, there’s no need for that, professor. I know what ‘talking’ means in this context and I assure you, you don’t need to go out of your way to get vengeance for me. People like that are annoying, but if I went out of my way to spite every idiot who wanted to get something from me, I would be spending more time plotting than I do singing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard, meanwhile, made a mental note to find out who this particular knight happened to be. She didn’t think of herself as the vengeful type, but if there was the potential for this man to be a problem down the line, well, it was only right Hubert heard of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Such thoughts could be saved for later though as the three ladies–well, technically a princess, a songstress, and a mercenary-turned-professor–headed inside the sweets shop. Moments later, the trio were seated at a table outside with a box of confectioneries between them and three bowls of sorbet, one for each of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm~! Oh, this is delicious~!” Dorothea praised, “We really must visit here more often~!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take care not to overdo it, Dorothea,” Edelgard chided, “It may be nice to go out for sweets every once in a while, but we do still have responsibilities.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mmm, if you say so, Edie. Though I can’t help but notice you’re already half-finished with your own bowl~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard reddened, before ducking her head and simply having another scoop of sorbet in lieu of responding, earning another giggle from Dorothea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Do you think I can get another?” Byleth asked, her own bowl already completely finished.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea couldn’t help but laugh at the sight, smiling in clear delight as Edelgard frowned. “Professor, you made a complete mess of your face again. Here–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no need.” Byleth fished a handkerchief from her coat pocket and used it to clean her face, prompting a curious look from Dorothea when she noticed the design of this particular handkerchief. Including the obvious double-headed eagle insignia on it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, isn’t that Edelgard’s?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Yeah, she said I could keep it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She did, did she?” Dorothea glanced at the future emperor with a small smile, who immediately blushed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I said she could return it later!" Edelgard said, defending herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, how generous of you, Edie~! Oh, Professor, if you’re going up to get another bowl, would you mind getting one for Edie too?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure. I’ll be right back. Do you want the peach one again?” Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Er…yes, thank you, though I still have some left.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s fine. I’ll have the rest if you don’t finish.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea giggled as the professor left, before fixing Edelgard with an amused expression. “So, going after the professor, are we~?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What? No! No, of course not, that was just–All I was doing was being helpful, Dorothea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you say so~!” she chirped, not at all believing her friend for a second and giggling as Edelgard mullishly ate her remaining sorbet. It didn’t help Edie’s case at all that she obviously sat up straighter when the professor returned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hm, professor, perhaps we shouldn't be having too many sweets." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? But they taste good." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, but they can be unhealthy if you have too many," she said, despite also digging into the peach sorbet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They can be?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea giggled. "Heh, let me guess professor, you haven't had sweets before." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Had some with that tea party, but never before the academy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well in that case, I can see why you want to enjoy yourself, but at the very least might want to be careful with the sorbet. Might end up getting a brain freeze if you aren't careful." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Brainfreeze?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's a head pain people can get from eating or drinking something cold." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…so that's why my head hurts…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Perhaps we've had enough for today, professor," Edelgard said, before raising a hand out to stop Byleth from eating more, only for her to keep trying. It took both the princess and songstress to stop their professor from trying to eat more sorbet. It was certainly interesting to see how stubborn she could be over something so small…</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Hey By, there you are!" Shez shouted, making Byleth look over, blinking in surprise as she saw her sister pushing Dimitri towards her. "We need to talk to you!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez, there is no need to interrupt the pro-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She's not doing anything so it's not interrupting, right, By?" Shez asked, before taking a look at her sister. "Did you cut your hair?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hairstylist did. Dorothea took Edelgard and I into town." Bringing her hand up, she offered a box of confectioneries to Shez. "Here, I brought some for you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...okay I really want to know what happened, but Dimitri has to talk to you first." With that, she shoved Dimitri forward a bit. "Otherwise he'll never ask." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ask me what?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Letting out a sigh, Dimitri faced Byleth as he stood straight. "Professor, I wanted to speak to you about the mission your class received." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What exactly do you want to talk about?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was wondering if it would be possible that our classes could swap missions? I understand that this is something we would need to talk about with Lady Rhea, but it is my belief that sending Empire students to deal with a lord of the Kingdom will not end well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I really only know what you all have told me about the issues between the Kingdom and the Empire, but I can see why you would think so. Are the rest of your classmates in agreement?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, no one really thinks it's a good idea for your class to take it," Shez piped in, "Even Professor Hanneman said the 'optics' didn't look good. Besides, this way you don't have to work with Catherine, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri frowned. “Is there a problem with Lady Catherine?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A personal one,” Byleth answered, “We’re working on it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Well, if it would be better for the two of you to avoid going on missions together, then that’s all the more reason for us to switch assignments. That is, if you would not mind?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t. I’ll ask my class what they would prefer. I don’t know if it matters though. Lady Rhea is the one that assigns missions, so I assume she would have the final say.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? I was under the impression Seteth was the one handing them out…Hm, though I suppose he is ultimately only carrying out her wishes, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No, you just had the wrong impression.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez glanced at her house leader, then frowned at her sister. “Hey, come on By, be nicer to Dimitri! He’s sensitive!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I am?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, sorry, your highness,” Byleth said, before fully bowing her head in apology.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I feel as though I am being made fun of.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would it be better if I knelt?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t.”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>The next day, Byleth waited in the Archbishop’s audience chambers alongside Edelgard, Dimitri, and Hanneman. As the leaders of the Black Eagles and Blue Lions, it was to be expected the four of them would be involved given their upcoming request. One which Byleth would have to make as it seemed, odd as it was to say, that Rhea favored her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn't exactly sure what it was about her, as she had no real experience teaching, and while she was certainly strong, her spar with Catherine showed there were others stronger still. Even so, she ended up in a teaching position at a prestigious academy, and had been given far bigger missions than the other professors had so far. It was easy to say that it was simply bad luck her class had to deal with bandits but… it was clear Zanado was a holy land, one that people weren't allowed to enter, and yet her class was told to do so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It would have made more sense for the knights to handle it, far safer, and that way her students didn't walk over sacred land. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Barely even a day had passed after that mission before she was told to stomp out a rebellion. While Byleth herself had never dealt with a rebellion, even she could tell just what that meant, even if they would just be the rearguard…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regardless, Rhea kept giving her these missions, and most would be honored to have the trust of the Archbishop but…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea didn't like Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No, that was probably unfair. She never expressed any dislike to Shez, but when it came to the two of them, Rhea didn't pay Shez any heed. As if the only one that mattered was Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And that mattered to Byleth. It was one thing to hear from her father that Rhea wasn’t trustworthy, that Rhea had something to do with her mother’s death and her father just couldn’t trust the strangely familiar woman, but seeing how little interest she had in Shez took that strange fascination she seemed to have with Byleth and made it aggravating.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But Byleth wasn’t going to focus on that. She was here at her student’s behest, so she was going to stay professional. Even if a part of her wanted to avoid the archbishop entirely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good morning, everyone,” Lady Rhea greeted them as she walked into the audience chamber along with Seteth. She looked as composed as ever, her hands folded together as she took her typical position with her chamberlain behind her. “To what do I owe the pleasure of having two professors and two house leaders seeking an audience with me so early in the month?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t quite call it pleasure, Lady Rhea,” Professor Hanneman began, taking the lead in negotiations. Byleth was pretty sure this would be a negotiation, not just a matter of asking and receiving. “My fellow professor and I, along with our students, wished to speak with you regarding the matter of this month’s mission.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea regarded him with some curiosity. “Go on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He nodded. “To be clear, both of our houses, the Blue Lions and the Black Eagles, have expressed reservations with the choice to assign the Black Eagles House the mission of accompanying the Knights of Seiros to the site of a rebellion within the Kingdom’s territory. The current leader of the rebellion, Lord Lonato of House Gaspard, is a noble of Faerghus, and our students believe, not without reason, that sending a class primarily composed of Adrestian nobles on a mission that would more than likely involve the killing of Kingdom citizens could potentially worsen relations between Faerghus and Adrestia.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Is this true, Dimitri? Edelgard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both house leaders placed their hands over their hearts and bowed to the archbishop, before Dimitri spoke first. “Lady Rhea, I am not alone among my classmates in believing that sending Adrestian students to handle a matter that is ultimately the responsibility of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus may send the wrong message to the nobility of the Kingdom. In this time of heightened tensions, we feel there is too great a risk that the situation could worsen if it appeared that nobles of the Empire were allowed to interfere in the Kingdom’s affairs, even at the behest of the Church.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have to agree, your grace,” Edelgard stated, “Since the death of my uncle Volkhard and the horrific assassination of King Lambert of Faerghus, groundless conspiracies have circulated among the courts of both of our nations that the two events are linked. I do not believe it is an unfounded concern that tensions may be inflamed by the Black Eagles being sent on a mission that our fellow classmates feel so strongly about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. But it’s not really a matter of the Kingdom to handle, is it?” Seteth pointed out, “Lonato specifically declared that his rebellion was against the Church of Seiros, not against the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. That means it is a matter of the Knights of Seiros to handle, and that naturally extends to the Officer’s Academy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“With all due respect, Seteth,” Dimitri began, “Lonato is still a noble of Faerghus. I can agree that in this particular instance, his actions do make him a matter for the Church and the Knights to deal with, but even still, care should be taken in who specifically is selected to handle this matter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Black Eagles are students of the Officer’s Academy before they are citizens of the Empire,” Rhea said, her tone polite but chiding, “Just as all faithful are children of the Goddess before they are citizens of their nations. The Goddess does not care for mortal boundaries, and neither should her faithful take umbrage with those she has chosen to carry out her will.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not how it works.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All eyes turned towards Byleth as she bluntly contradicted the archbishop’s words. Dimitri’s mouth snapped shut, his own response dying before it could be spoken as he glanced at the archbishop. Edelgard, meanwhile, simply regarded her professor with further interest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for the archbishop herself, no surprise showed on her face as she turned to her newest professor. “And what do you mean by that, child?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“People don’t look past things like homelands that easily. Everyone in my father’s mercenary band was united under his leadership, but that didn’t stop them from arguing or making comments about each other based on where they came from. It never escalated to fighting, but that was because we were all working together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then you do see my point then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shook her head. “It’s not the same thing. My father’s mercenary band is like this monastery.” She ignored the offended look Seteth gave her. “People from different nations come here and unite under your leadership. That’s one thing. Faerghus and Adrestia are like two noble houses, just on a bigger scale. They have their own responsibilities and people to care for. If one of them hires a mercenary band to clear out problems on their land, that isn’t a problem. But if the other house hires mercenaries to go into their rival’s land, even if it was still to handle problems for them, then that rival is going to get upset.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Church of Seiros isn’t a mercenary band,” Seteth stated, frowning at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s an analogy.” Byleth paused, then glanced at Dimitri. “A metaphor is a type of analogy. Metaphors are more specifically comparing two unlike things, usually in a poetic sense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...thank you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She nodded, then faced the archbishop again. “It’s not quite the same situation. Here, it’s more like if the mercenary band, which is the Knights in this analogy, decided to take along members of the rival house…let’s call it House Crimson, on a mission assigned to them by House Azure. House Azure is fully within its rights to be upset with…the Silverheart Mercenaries, because they don’t want members of House Crimson to be on Azure lands. If the Silverheart Mercenaries decide to bring the members of House Crimson along with them anyway, even if it is to clear out a giant wolf that’s causing trouble on House Azure’s lands, then things could escalate between the two houses anyway, and the Silverhearts would be at fault for causing the conflict, and that can be really bad for a mercenary band.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Church of Seiros still isn’t a mercenary band,” Seteth repeated, his arms crossed over his chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes. I know. Do you…not know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seteth’s eyes narrowed at her. “I know what a metaphor is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay. Good work.” She gave him a thumbs up. He kept glaring at her. She lowered her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...While I can see what point you wish to make, child, it is the will of the goddess that these assignments be given as they are,” Rhea explained, “Fodlan requires aid in many places, for though the goddess is merciful, it is by mortal hands that it is made turbulent.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Rhea, if I may,” Dimitri began again, “It is our intention to prevent further…turbulence among our peoples. We do not disagree that Fodlan needs safeguarding, we just believe we could safeguard just as well, if not better, through a different arrangement. If the Black Eagles were sent to deal with the bandits we were assigned–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dimitri, I appreciate your reasoning, but you should not question the will of the goddess.” Though her tone was patient, it was hard not to hear the reprimand in Rhea’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“With all due respect, Lady Rhea, isn’t it also the goddess’s will that we humans make choices of our own?” Edelgard inquired in an equally polite tone, clearly intending no offense. “While some choices are clearly poor ones, we shouldn’t ignore the human element here. It is our duty as rulers to act in a manner befitting our people and guarantee their prosperity. All that to say, I’m having trouble understanding why our assignments have been arranged so specifically. May I ask for your guidance on this matter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea regarded the young princess of Adrestia, the sole heir of a thousand year old bloodline, and smiled slightly at the memories her unwavering gaze brought her. “I will gladly offer guidance when needed, Edelgard. Am I to understand that you both hold these deep reservations over what should be a simple matter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, we do.” Both future rulers answered, one after the other, and Rhea regarded them thoughtfully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Very well then. I thank you both for being so forthright in bringing this matter to my attention. As such, I am willing to make an adjustment as needed. Though you have also brought quite the concerning prospect to my attention, that of the worsening relations between the Empire and the Kingdom. As such, rather than having the Black Eagles House alone be assigned to the mission in question, I propose that both Black Eagles and Blue Lions join forces in order to mend the relationship between these two great nations.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri and Edelgard blinked, visibly caught off guard, and shared a look on instinct, attempting to confirm what they just heard was correct. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hanneman, meanwhile, nodded slowly, rubbing at his beard with a small frown. “It is a solution, certainly. Though I don’t think it entirely removes the issue of Adrestian nobles facing Faerghan citizens, even treasonous ones…Ultimately though, I do not have an objection to our two houses participating in the same assignment. Professor Byleth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “I guess it works. It would be like inviting people from House Azure over to act as minders for the Crimson vassals, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you still on about that?” Seteth asked with another frown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It works, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, professor, before we continue, I wanted to ask,” Dimitri began, glancing at Byleth, “How are things between you and Catherine?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard tried to avoid letting her irritation show. Of course the lion prince couldn’t be subtle for one second…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Is there some type of trouble between you and Catherine?” Seteth asked, looking towards Byleth too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine. I don’t like her that much. We can still work together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Truly? I could have her removed from the mission if you require, child,” Rhea offered, and it was hard to miss the looks everyone gave her, especially as Dimitri’s jaw outright dropped from the blatant favoritism on display.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s fine,” Byleth replied, “Like I said, we can still work together. She’s a good fighter and she’d be good to have along.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. Though, if you happen to have any further troubles with anyone in the church or the knights, please, let me know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, okay.” Byleth glanced at the house leaders and Hanneman, who had all managed to regain their composure before Rhea noticed. “Do any of you need anything else?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, no, I do not believe so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, professor, I have said all I wished to say.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After Dimitri and Edelgard’s responses, Hanneman clapped his hands together. “Well then, it seems we have no further problems! Thank you very much for hearing us out, Lady Rhea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. May the goddess ever watch over you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And thus ended the meeting between the archbishop and the quartet of professors and house leaders. Yet that was not the end of matters, as Byleth showed by turning to Hanneman once they all left the audience chamber.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Professor Hanneman.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, you need not call me professor, Miss Eisner. We are colleagues, after all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, okay, Mister…um…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Essar, my colleague. Though I suppose we could just use our given names, if that would not be too familiar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s really not. Also, I had a question. What’s a wingman?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hanneman blinked, a reaction shared by Dimitri, who paused to listen while Edelgard let out a sigh. “Pardon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A ‘wingman’. In the context of dating specifically. I tried looking up the term but I couldn’t find a definition. I did find some information about metaphors though, which was helpful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahh, that does explain your allegorical tendencies back there…Well, I would never want to leave a colleague ignorant, I will admit, I am curious where you heard that term to begin with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“From Sylvain.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?!” Dimitri exclaimed, sounding scandalized, “Professor, I can’t apologize enough for my classmate’s conduct! In fact, I’ll go get him! He needs to make things right!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He ran off, prompting a sigh from Hanneman. “Oh dear, I had better head that off. My apologies, professor, we can reconvene later. Take care!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth watched as Hanneman hurried after his student, leaving her alone with Edelgard. “Hm. He didn’t explain what it meant.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps it’s better not to ask, professor,” Edelgard suggested, “It’s a silly topic to begin with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess. Hey, do you know what a wingman is?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course I do. It…” Edelgard frowned. “...It has something to do with wyverns, I believe. Something…metaphorical.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like the wyverns and the pegasi?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused. “...Hm. I guess I need to explain sex to you. That feels like something it would be important for nobles to know before now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard stared at her professor, genuinely too caught off guard to even get embarrassed. “...Professor, that…what are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, Gertrude should still have those books about it. I’ll get them. I guess I should make it a full lesson just in case? Hm…I’ll think about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard watched her professor start to walk off, then considered the enormous awkwardness that would inevitably come from having the stoic mercenary attempt to explain sex to her class in particular. “...Wait, professor! You really don’t need to!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately for her, Byleth had longer legs than her, and was quite difficult to catch.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Archbishop Rhea settled back in the seat behind her desk and let out a slow sigh as she eased into the comfortable leather. “Hm…Seteth. What do you think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her chamberlain and closest confidante let out a sigh of his own in response to her question. “...I hate to admit it, but the new professor did make a decent, if childish, analogy earlier. Really, House Azure, House Crimson, and the Silverheart Mercenaries aren’t bad names at all, particularly if one were trying to illustrate politics on a basic level. Though perhaps ‘The Silverheart Knights’ would be better?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Seteth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you’re right, the mercenary aspect is a core component. I couldn’t in good conscience remove it, not without fundamentally altering the story she put together…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea sighed again, this time with more exasperation as she massaged her head. “Not that part, Seteth. I meant the concession I made. As well as if the political situation between the Kingdom and the Empire truly is so dire that my students consider the mere act of sending the incorrect class tantamount to igniting the alcohol stores.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah yes, admittedly I don't keep up to date with all the goings on but… it is quite clear there are tensions between the classes alone, and while the relationships have remained cordial, there is no saying what could set it off."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see… perhaps we should set up more inter house events?" It wasn't the best solution she will admit, but it was one nonetheless. If she was to bring back her mother then a time of war would only make things more difficult for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… I can try to see what we can concoct. There is the choir festival that's coming up, perhaps we can convince the teachers to have more of their students participate?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is a start. Let us pray that the goddess can guide us through these turbulent times." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…" Seteth seemed deep in thought, getting Rhea’s attention. "...House Golden would be too straightforward for a third noble house. Perhaps House Verdant, given a deer's dietary preferences?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I see we shall have to discuss this later."</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Sadly for Byleth, her questions on what a wingman were would remain unanswered, as she had something else to focus on right now. As they would be working together for the mission, Hanneman suggested they teach the classes together to better prepare them. However, with the classrooms themselves being too small for two classes, they ended up in the courtyard so they weren't cramped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, the problem with this became evident as most students were clearly keeping to their own class. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…this could be going better," Shez said to herself. Not unreasonably, considering the two classes were basically forming their own separate clumps on opposite ends of the makeshift “classroom” set up on the grass. The Black Eagles were a little more spread out among the desks, but the Lions looked like they were minutes away from forming a defensive wall and declaring their portion of the courtyard a sovereign nation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mostly because of Ingrid, who was making a point of sitting as far away from the Black Eagle students as she could, though Mercedes and Annette weren’t really helping things by deciding to sit with her. They probably had good intentions like making sure she wasn’t feeling left out, but add in Ashe also sitting close by and Felix being his usual standoffish self and things could be going better.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It definitely didn’t help that Sylvain tried to greet the “lovely ladies of the Eagles” and Dorothea made a point of moving as far away from him as possible, made all the worse by Petra following her to ask what was wrong with Sylvain. Then there was Bernadetta hiding under the desk and Linhardt sleeping again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, the house leaders and their retainers were up at the front and trying to be cordial despite the awkwardness, especially since their professors seemed to be busy trying to figure out what their lesson plan for the day was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…” Shez glanced over at the Eagles, wondering if she should take a chance on the more sociable of the bunch. Dorothea was usually nice, but it would be kind of awkward to approach her after Sylvain’s screw-up, right? Ugh, social stuff was hard when it involved nobles…Maybe she should try Caspar? He seemed nice. Competitive too, which Shez could appreciate–And he just joined Dorothea and Petra, great. It made sense, sure, they were the most lively of the classes at the moment, but it was super inconvenient for Shez…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe she should try Ferdinand?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked at Ferdinand, who somehow already had stacks of notes and books in front of him as he wrote at a rapid pace. She decided not to try Ferdinand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which left the other odd girl out of their groups.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which hm… something about her also seemed weirdly familiar…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that not the girl who was able to defend herself against you during the mock battle?" Arval asked, looking over at Emily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh right, that's probably how I know her," Shez replied, wiping away her previous sense of familiarity. With a grin, she approached the brown-haired girl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey!” Shez greeted as she slid into the seat next to Emily, who looked extremely bored as she stared up at the front of the “classroom”. Not really at anything, just in that general direction, though she still visibly startled at the sound of Shez’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gah–Ah, what? What are you doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sitting with you. I figured since today’s about ‘inter-house relations’ and stuff, I should at least sit by an Eagle, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Her stare was extremely suspicious for some reason. “...And you sat by me specifically, because?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, part of it is that you’re sitting on your own so it’s easier to just come up and start talking, but most of it is because you actually kept up with me while I was in my awakened form.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Is that what it’s called?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s what I call it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh…So…Where are you from?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well all over the place, mostly, since my dad and sister are mercenaries, as am I of course, but if we’re talking about places of origin, I’m actually from Ordelia over in the Alliance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily’s eyes widened for a second before she regarded Shez with…well it was kind of hard to tell what she was regarding her with. It wasn’t suspicion, but more like Shez had confirmed something? Which was kind of weird. “Really. I’m actually from…Hrym, myself. I was born there, at least.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh hey, small world! That’s right on the border, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, practically the same land. The place I grew up in was pretty cavernous. How about you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I grew up in the mountains! Just me and my mom, plus some villagers but they don’t really count.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily huffed in some amusement. “No, they really don’t. Your mom, huh? What was her name?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Periander! How about you, who did you grow up with?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She snorted that time, actually smiling a little. “Oh, you know. Standard family stuff. I grew up hunting down beasts and vermin.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you hunt? Well I guess that makes sense. Was it more for sport or for food?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sport, mostly, though I guess there was some necessity to it. Still, you wouldn’t really ‘eat’ vermin, now would you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I’ve eaten a rat when I was hungry enough.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily blinked, then gave her a look that was half-disgusted and half-impressed. “...are we being literal about ‘eating’ right now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah? Why wouldn’t we be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, just…well, it’s dirty, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shrugged. “Food’s food when you’re hungry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh. You’re…interesting, Shez.” She glanced towards the front, towards Byleth. “...So what’s the story there? You just happened to find the former knight’s captain and his whelp and joined up with them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretty much? I mean, there’s some specifics to it, sort of a hunting accident thing and I didn’t know who he was at the time. Not that it really mattered, at that point I was just looking for a new mercenary group to join up with. Everything else sort of…happened naturally after that.” She paused. “Also you probably shouldn’t call Byleth a ‘whelp’. I know you’re a noble and all, but most people consider that rude.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily scoffed. “Fine. I swear, you sound like…Selene. She’s always nagging me about staying ‘polite’ and ‘avoiding violence’. I was sent by this damned church to kill bandits, was I not supposed to enjoy myself?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably not. I know I’ve gotten weird looks for counting my kills on a mission.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, it’s mostly a competitive thing though. I want to prove I can do better than Byleth, so I usually keep track of my kills to show I got more than her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, showing your superiority then. I can respect that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, so who’s Selene?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh. An annoyance who thinks she knows better than me. I can introduce you to her later, though…then again, she did get on my case last time…let’s just ignore that for now. I’m more curious about what your plans here are anyway.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh you know, the basic stuff. Graduate and make a name for myself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahh. Basic, but I can respect it. Do I get to know any specifics, or…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I’ll tell you when I figure them out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, you tease. Fine, I’ll try to be patient. It’s what everyone says I need to do at this stupid place anyway.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I can’t say I’m the monastery’s biggest fan either, especially with the Knights and how weird the archbishop is,” Shez muttered, before glancing at her new friend, “How about you? Anything you want to do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…Fight, hunt, kill. Bathe in the blood of my enemies and reign supreme over the vermin. That sort of thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez just nodded along. “So nothing really specific either, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not really. I wanted to win a certain someone’s approval, but he’s dead now, so that can’t happen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez would’ve asked a follow-up question to that, because wow was that statement loaded with implications, but she was interrupted by Professor Hanneman finally addressing the classes. “Alright, class! Or, classes, as the case currently is. Professor Byleth and I have decided, going forward, we shall be focusing on a different lesson plan than we initially, well, planned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Due to the importance of the upcoming mission our classes will be cooperating on, we will forgo our previous subjects in favor of focusing on theoretical and practical tactics. As such, I will be lecturing for the first portion of our shared class time, followed by Professor Byleth. I understand we are doing things quite differently than usual, so thank you all for being so accommodating! Now, to begin–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uuugh, great, back to this shit,” Emily grumbled, propping her head up on her hand as she barely pretended to listen along. At least she was keeping quiet enough that Hanneman and Byleth didn't hear her. Still, Shez did at least make an attempt to listen as Hanneman was talking about what exactly they would do as the 'rear guard'. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For the most part, it seemed that they would be simply traveling alongside a small squad of knights, and dealing with any remaining knights loyal to Lord Lonato while the vanguard dealt with the main forces. There were of course many other factors to take into consideration too, or at least that’s what Hanneman was saying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That is what our classes shall be focusing on. I shall be providing several examples on what may occur during our mission, while Professor Byleth shall have you actively practicing them afterwards." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"During practical practice, I'll be splitting you into two groups, one 'defensive' and one 'offensive'." Byleth explained, before looking over at Ingrid as she raised her hand. "Yes, Ingrid?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I assume we'll be split between classes and change which side we're on in between attempts?" she asked, getting Byleth to shake her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The groups will be a mix of each class. If we keep the classes split, then we'll only end up hampering one another while in combat." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, are you certain that is a good idea?" Ferdinand asked, "I can see the value in what you are saying, but at the same time, we may just end up at odds with one another in training." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Anyone who disrupts training will be reprimanded, and any further disruptions will see them getting punished. Anyone who actively endangers another student will be severely punished." Byleth said leaving no room for negotiation. "Hanneman, you can continue." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you." With a nod, Hanneman faced the class again. "Now, let's start off with a simple example," Hanneman said as he began to draw on the chalkboard, making a few rudimentary trees to symbolize a forest and some dots to symbolize the students. "The most likely scenario we shall face will be encountering random stragglers on our march." He marked some random x's on the map, before making an arrow pointing where the dots would be going. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can anyone tell me what the best course of action for our march would be?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Find the stragglers and beat them," Felix said, as if it was simple. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is more of a goal than a strategy, Felix. Perhaps you can give a more concrete plan?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m a warrior, not a tracker. How should I know how to find them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, are we doing the hunting then?” Petra asked, “I have much experience with matters of hunting. May I be knowing what the…ah, the terrain. May I be knowing what the terrain is like?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“An excellent question, Petra! Knowing the terrain is extremely important when it comes to figuring out how best to face your foe, particularly when they have a homeland advantage. Now, the Gaspard territory is a region in southern Faerghus that is easily accessible from Garreg Mach via travel through Magdred Way–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Hanneman continued his lecture on the geography of the region, Shez felt her attention starting to slip away from the lesson. She wasn’t great with maps in general so the information was just sort of drifting out of her brain as she heard it. Hanneman could be interesting, but when the topic already bored Shez, she just couldn’t focus even if he was being passionate about it. And he wasn’t being enthusiastic at the moment, so yeah, it wasn’t a big surprise her mind started to wander and she wound up poking an equally bored-looking Emily in the side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other girl jerked, then shot her a glare that Shez returned with a grin instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Then Emily poked her back, jabbing her finger hard into Shez’s side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gh-Mn.” Shez frowned as her new friend grinned, before trying to jab her back, only to get her hand slapped away instead. Which just turned her small diversion into an actual competition! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So the pair promptly spent the next few minutes of class time attempting to jab each other as hard as they could while still being subtle enough not to get caught. It was pretty fun, up until Shez wound up poking Emily a bit too hard and was full on punched in the face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit–” Emily cut herself off with a genuine wince, “That was–It was just reflex–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sh!” Shez hissed, ducking her head and glancing around to make sure no one saw that, despite the fact that she was the one who’d just been hit. Thankfully, it looked like everyone was more focused on the lecture…though she did grimace when she noticed Byleth plainly staring at her with an unimpressed look. She gave her sister a sheepish wave, before sitting back with a little huff as she felt at her nose. “Ow…you have a really good hook.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...uh…thanks? Are you…You good?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, of course. It’s gonna take more than a pretty noble’s dainty punch to lay me out,” she teased.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well fine, I won’t ask the next time I deck you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh so there’s going to be a next time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, Emily, don’t talk during the lecture,” Byleth spoke up, making a number of their classmates glance at the pair, prompting a scowl from Emily and another sheepish grin from Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, sorry! We’ll be good!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth just nodded, prompting a half-amused, half-annoyed noise from Emily. “Teacher’s pet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, it’s different when the teacher’s my sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure it is. It means you’re sucking up to your big, strong ‘sister’ instead of trying to score points with the faculty. Lucky for you, she’s both, so you only have to brown-nose once to get double the rewards.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez narrowed her eyes at the Eagle student, before smirking and giving her a light kick under the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Emily turned back to her, her expression flat and unamused…aside from the small twitch to her lips as she tried to hide a grin. “You realize this means war, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure does. Just don’t kick me out of my seat, alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No promises.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t, though it was a near thing.</span>

  <p>
  <span>"For the purpose of this exercise the 'defenders' will only need to evade the 'attackers' for thirty minutes for them to win," Byleth explained to the students as they gathered in the field where the mock battle was held. "The attackers will start together while the defenders will be spread out throughout the forest." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If we beat up the other team, do we win?" Caspar asked as he stood with the defense team, consisting of him, Ferdinand, Dimitri and Annette. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That is also an option." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, you're welcome to try," Felix challenged as he stood with the attacking team, consisting of him, Ingrid, Edelgard, and Petra. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh I'm going to do more than try!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do keep in mind this is only an exercise so excessive force will not be allowed. If you are forced down to one knee or start bleeding, you're out," Byleth said, before nodding to the defense team. "If you will follow me, I'll guide you to your positions." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good luck guys!" Shez cheered them on from the sidelines. It wasn’t her turn just yet, she was just excited to see the match play out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let's do our best!" Annette also cheered on as she followed her team. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then in the meantime let us develop our plan," Edelgard said, trying to immediately take charge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What's there to plan? She tracks them and I beat them." Felix responded as he gestured at Petra. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Leave it to me!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not that I doubt Petra's abilities, but chasing them down one by one may take too much time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if they'll be hiding. With how loud those two Black Eagles are, they'll practically be begging us to find them,” Ingrid said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Felix smirked. “And the boar will be even worse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Felix!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There is a boar?” Petra asked, confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I believe he’s referring to Dimitri,” Edelgard explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah! This is the metaphor! Professor Byleth was explaining this to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“His highness is not a boar!” Ingrid snapped, before glaring at Felix, “And Felix–H-Hey! Don’t walk away from me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re in the middle of a competition. Either help out or stay standing around gossiping about the boar with your new best friends.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–That’s not–Ugh, you’re impossible sometimes, you know that!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard sighed as she watched the blonde stomp after her classmate, clearly intent on lecturing him further. “This is going to be difficult…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Or, well, it would have been, if Caspar hadn’t decided he would rather be on the attack by “ambushing” them. Which consisted of him leaping from a tree with a war cry while swinging a wooden axe straight into the ground because he missed them entirely. And then the axe happened to get stuck in the dirt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suffice to say, it was fairly easy for all four of the attackers to subdue him after that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really, what was he thinking?” Ingrid asked after Caspar was sent off the field without his weapon, “The whole purpose of the exercise is to stay on the defensive, not just attack out of nowhere like some wildman.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Caspar is…enthusiastic,” Edelgard elected to say, deciding to be charitable to her classmate, “I won’t disagree that it has caused him more problems than he would have otherwise though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then shouldn’t you be fixing that? You’re supposed to be his house leader, after all. Or are such things beneath her royal highness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned at the blatant hostility. “Should I take that to mean that your house leader takes an active role in correcting his housemates’ issues?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course! His highness has been a perfect leader, one who would never do something as foolish as–...” Ingrid trailed off, largely because their group had come to a clearing where Dimitri stood at attention, his spear in hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, there you are! You will go no further, for I shall protect my fellow defenders directly!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Edelgard glanced at Ingrid. “To be fair, he isn’t directly attacking us. He is still acting on the defensive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Please don’t try to comfort me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri blinked. “Comfort you? Is something wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, there isn’t,” Felix said as he stepped from the trees he’d been searching, wooden sword in hand, “Especially not now that I have a chance to settle things with you, boar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Felix…very well then. Though you are my friend, I shall not hold back–Ow!” Dimitri exclaimed, a hand immediately going to his head where a rock had just bounced off of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“P-Petra! Don’t throw rocks at his highness!” Ingrid protested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Brigidian princess just looked confused though. “Are we not meant to be making the defenders be bleeding? Professor Byleth said to have blood drawn is to be disqualified, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–W-Well, still!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine, Ingrid,” Dimitri said, waving off her concern as he tossed his spear aside, “Petra acted within the bounds of the exercise. Now I think I’m going to go ask the professor to heal this, because…ow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Felix, meanwhile, grunted irritably before just heading off into another part of the woods, aiming to track down another one of the defenders. He didn’t, though Petra did manage to find Ferdinand, who had actually bothered to hide.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So it seems you’ve caught me…but I will not be going down without a–Ow!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, I don’t think the professor had throwing rocks in mind when she laid out the parameters of this exercise,” Edelgard noted after Ferdinand wandered off, rubbing the bruise on his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I doubt the professor had much in mind with how vague those ‘parameters’ were,” Ingrid grumbled, prompting frowns from both Eagles.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do not be insulting the professor,” Petra said, glaring at Ingrid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? I wasn’t, I just–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were. You are saying she does not have much in her mind, that is an insult.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not what I meant!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do not be lying to me! You are thinking I am being stupid too?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I didn’t say that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But it is what you are meaning! You are being insulting the entire of this time!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re both being stupid,” Felix interrupted, scowling at both of them, which was the exact wrong thing to say as Petra visibly stiffened. “We still have a–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I AM NOT STUPID!” Petra snapped, glaring straight at Felix and actually stepping towards him, her hand tight around the rock still in her grip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Felix blinked, before his eyes narrowed. “Then stop acting like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Petra’s eyes widened before a genuine snarl came to her face–And then Edelgard punched Felix straight in the face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Felix!” Ingrid exclaimed as her friend stumbled back, before glaring at Edelgard. “What was that?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard shrugged, idly shaking out her hand. “I believe that was me disqualifying myself for deliberately injuring a team member. Petra’s more useful as a tracker, so it’s better I leave than she does. Your problems are with me, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Staying quiet, Ingrid stared as Edelgard walked off, leaving her with Petra and Felix, who was getting up from the punch, his cheek already bruised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, didn't expect someone so small to be so strong," Felix said, a bit of interest in his voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Seriously? That's what you're focused on?" Ingrid asked, very exasperated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I shall continue the hunt," Petra said, before Ingrid stopped her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, Petra." Frowning, Ingrid tried to think of how to say what she wanted. "I'm sorry, I genuinely don't have anything against you, especially as a prisoner of the empire." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I am not just a prisoner. Edelgard is my friend. Any insult you speak of her, or our professor, is one I shall not stand," Petra said, surprising Ingrid. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That–I don't understand how you can think of anyone from the Empire as your friend after what happened to your people." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...None of my classmates were in the conflict. They are not the ones who were fighting, much like how I did not fight back then. I may not have understanding of your anger, but I do not believe any of them hurt you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They…It’s more complicated than that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Petra shrugged. “If you are saying so, I will not further be arguing. I am not agreeing, yet I am willing to be putting aside our conflicts to be finishing our assignment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Ingrid sighed, then tried to smile. “Yes, we should get back to the exercise. We should still have some time to find Annette and win this, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They didn’t. Or at least they didn’t have enough time to actually find Annette before the exercise ended, because the smallest Lion actually did her best to hide the entire time instead of trying to fight the attackers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! I knew hiding in the trees would work!” Annette exclaimed with a happy grin after the professor announced her team the winners of the exercise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I should have thinking of that before,” Petra commented, half-disappointed and half-impressed, “Tree tops are very safe places to be hiding.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right? Though I can’t take all the credit, I actually got the idea from seeing Caspar scramble up into the trees so quickly early on!” Annette grinned over at her teammate, who looked a little sheepish. “Though it looks like they found you anyway, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah, yeah, uh…Well, it’s more like I let myself be found! Because I never run from a fight!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you just jumped into a fight you couldn’t win,” Felix commented, ignoring how most of his classmates were looking at the obvious bruise on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I would’ve had a chance if my axe didn’t get stuck!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t swing your axe into dirt next time, Caspar,” Byleth chided, “As you discovered, it can get stuck in the ground really easily. You also would have done actual damage if that hit landed. Just because the weapon is blunt doesn’t mean it can’t cause injuries.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…sorry about that, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay, you’re learning.” She turned to the rest of the teams. “Dimitri, you need to be more aware of your surroundings. You also can’t be on defense all on your own. A sacrifice play isn’t the worst move to make, but it does remove your ability to help after the fact.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I understand, professor.” Dimitri bowed his head, which had been healed up by the professor without even a scratch remaining. “What do you think would have been better?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…considering how the match played out, it would have been better for you, Caspar, and Ferdinand to form a defensive line while Annette hid. All three of you are decent melee combatants and joining together would have allowed you to cover each other's weaknesses and defend from things like sudden projectiles.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boys couldn’t help but glance at Petra. “...Yes, that probably would have been better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I suppose my issues were much then same then, professor?” Ferdinand asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sort of. You did try to hide, which wasn’t a bad plan since you were on your own at that point, though you did have the exact same outcome as Dimitri once you decided to fight, so you should also work on your spatial awareness. We can figure that out later though. Moving onto the attacker team, I can’t say you did well despite managing to eliminate three of your opponents.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, if I may.” Edelgard stepped forward. “I take full responsibility for how things went. I did not lead my teammates properly and I struck one of them in a moment of anger. Our failures were my responsibility.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was paying attention, Edelgard. I know what happened,” Byleth quite bluntly stated, making it clear to everyone on the attacker team that the professor was fully aware of their arguments, “That said, if you want to take responsibility, that’s fine. You are the house leader and arguably the leader of your team, though you did not take much of a leadership role past the beginning of the match. Should I take that to mean you didn’t think you could lead the Lions in your group?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned, before glancing at her teammates. Truthfully, she’d been willing to let things play out as they did, to a point, because she could tell Ingrid would be combative and Felix would be dismissive. That didn’t mean she should have left things as they were though, especially considering she had classmates with similarly difficult personalities. “...I didn’t think of it that way, professor, but you’re right. I should have been a stronger leader to my teammates, even if they aren’t in my house.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded. “If you want to lead, you need to lead everyone on your side, not just the people you like the best. On that subject, Felix, you didn’t work with your team at all. This was a team exercise, so that means you’ve failed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Felix frowned. “What do you mean I failed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I meant what I said. Your team lost, remember? It doesn’t matter if you succeed in your individual goals if you don’t achieve your overall objective. You didn’t do either anyway, so you failed and we’re going to need to work on that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He scowled, but didn’t reply, just crossing his arms over his chest as he glared mulishly at the professor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ingrid, I think you already know where you went wrong.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I do, professor,” Ingrid admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tensions are easy to rise and hard to quell. People say personal feelings don’t have a place on the battlefield, and they shouldn’t, but they tend to appear anyway. Just remember, it doesn’t matter where your comrades come from as long as they’re on your side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...But how can I be sure they’re actually on my side?” she asked, sounding ashamed to even be asking it but clearly having trouble.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Common interest. As long as you know they share the same goal you do, that’s all you need. Finally, Petra, good work with the rocks. That was smart thinking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Petra blinked, then smiled. “Ah, thank you professor! I am glad to be hearing my idea was a good one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was. Unexpected projectiles are difficult to defend against and even rocks can be extremely dangerous to the unprepared and undefended. For the record, I leave the parameters vague on purpose because on the battlefield you'll need to be able to think on your own. Being able to think up plans on the spot, will save you in combat should things go awry." With her piece said, she walked up and patted Petra and Annette on the head. "Good job." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you, professor!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph. You, Petra, was it?" Felix asked, getting the Brigid girl's attention as Byleth went to get the next group of students. "I want you to throw rocks at me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...May I be asking why?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not going to let myself get taken out as easily as the boar, so I want to train my reflexes. You throw things quickly," Felix said, as blunt as ever. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see. And will you be apologizing for your words and actions in the forest?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Felix grimaced. “I don’t see why I should.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then you will not be seeing the things you wish to be seeing. Apologize, or the rocks will be coming to the back of your head.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His scowl deepened, before he let out an aggrieved sigh. “Fine. I’m sorry I called you stupid. Can we get  on with this now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…You are being very lucky that I am wishing to throw rocks at you anyway. Be warned, I shall not be holding back!" With a firm nod, Petra grabbed several more rocks so she could assist him in training. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Glancing over at Ingrid, Edelgard gave her a curt nod, before walking back towards where the rest of her classmates were. As for Ingrid herself, her mind couldn't help but wander to Petra’s words, before she let out a frustrated huff and headed back to her own classmates.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The next practice mission faired a bit better as the attacking team of Bernadetta, Dorothea, Dedue and Ashe seemed to actually make a plan of attack while the defending team of Hubert, Linhardt, Mercedes and Sylvain were able to use the number of mages on their side to their advantage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not wanting to draw too much attention thanks to his size, Dedue would follow behind to cover their rear while Ashe and Bernadetta would take the lead to search for anyone hiding. With the front and rear decided, Dorothea, as the most sociable of the team, took on the leader role and took center position to give commands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That being said, they were still up against rather smart students. Stumbling across Linhardt, who appeared to be surrendering, they were unable to see the trap laid for them. Before they could apprehend him, they ended up getting blinded by a flash of light magic from Mercedes. A pair of yelps from Bernadetta and Ashe were able to tell Dorothea what was going on as she and Dedue retreated, only to run right into Hubert, who hit Dedue straight in the leg with a ball of magic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gh!” the large student grunted as he fell to a knee, before frowning over at Hubert.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t look so angry. The professor said either we draw blood or bring you to a knee, and I like to think I took the kinder option,” Hubert taunted, before aiming his hand at Dorothea, “Hello Dorothea. I would suggest you surrender now to spare yourself any extra–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he had to duck Dorothea’s responding shot as his fellow mage smirked. “Now Hubie, you should at least buy me dinner before trying to get me on my knees~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well hey, if he’s not going to take you up on it, mind if I accept that offer?” Sylvain asked as he poked the head of his spear against Dorothea’s back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Right, I forgot about you.” Dorothea sighed, before raising her hands in surrender.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good, that one went better,” Byleth began a few minutes later, once everyone was gathered again, “Good planning on both of your parts, Dorothea, Hubert. The formation was a good idea, Dorothea, though it left you vulnerable to traps, as you saw.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The songstress sighed. “Yes, that one trap did completely upend everything we wanted to do…I’m not sure what I could have done better though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…It depends. I wouldn’t say there’s much you could have done better, so much as done differently. Having Ashe and Bernadetta scout ahead was a good idea, but both of them were more vulnerable in melee combat. Ashe is better at it, but Bernadetta prefers being an archer. She does have a talent for lances…either way, she might have been better staying at your side. Dedue might be more noticeable, but he is hardier too and would be better at defending in the case of an ambush. You didn’t have a guarantee that was what your opponents would do, which is why you should consider who you’re facing. Does Hubert seem more like the type to hide or to fight, for instance?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea pouted. “Hubie’s more the type to do exactly what he did, which is to trap and ambush us. So…I guess I see your point.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded, before looking at Hubert. “Good work. You had a plan and you executed it well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why thank you, professor. Though, I should admit, I was thinking about it from the moment you announced what the teams would be for today.” He grinned. “I spent most of last match planning out the particulars.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s fine. Remember, everyone, planning ahead is always a good decision. Just leave yourself enough flexibility to change your plans if you need to. Also, I have one criticism. Don’t taunt your opponent while they’re still a threat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert sighed, his grin turning more wry. “You have a point, professor. It would have been quite embarrassing to be eliminated right at my moment of victory.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good. Mercedes, good work with the light spell. You did exactly what was required of you and you worked well with your teammates. Excellent job all around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The blonde beamed. “Thank you very much, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Linhardt, you also did well, but please take naps ahead of exercises. It would be bad if you fell asleep in the middle of battle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you’ll have to worry about that, professor,” Lin said with a sleepy yawn, before pausing, “Wait, do I have your permission to nap before exercises?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, if you have nothing better to do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think you might be my favorite professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked at that, before deciding to just move along. “Ashe, you did fine, though maybe we should work on your ability to fight in low vision situations. Being blinded is never fun, but there are ways to compensate for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh, ah, that’s good to know, professor! Thank you for the offer!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She nodded to him, then glanced at the tree Bernadetta was hiding behind. “Bernadetta, good work. You stayed on task and kept calm. You might have lost, but take pride in that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...m-mh, y-y-you d-don’t need t-to p-praise me so much,” Bernadetta mumbled, though it was hard to miss the happiness in her tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dedue, you did well. We should work on some techniques to deal with mages though. You probably would have been able to get back up and handle Hubert if it weren’t for the conditions of the match, so it’s not too bad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for your advice, professor, though I can’t help but think I could have done better,” he replied, prompting a thoughtful look from Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…You were ambushed, so there’s not much we can do aside from working on improving your spatial awareness. The problem is that your opponent decided to target you first since they recognized you would be the more immediate threat, and there’s not much we can do to keep that from happening aside from giving you enough armor to make sure anyone that tries is going to fail.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see…I would not be against practicing further with heavy armors then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Maybe later? That might be a good exercise, let some students be more heavily defended…” Byleth considered, before glancing at Sylvain. “Sylvain, you did well in following the plan and defeating your opponents. Stop sexually harassing your fellow students.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sylvain’s lazy grin dropped in genuine surprise. “Wha–Woah, wait, that’s not–I wasn’t, uh…I meant the offer for dinner, not…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The implications were obvious. On that subject, I should probably tell you not to do the same, Dorothea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The songstress pouted. “It was just a little teasing, professor. I wasn’t the one pressing my length of wood against a young woman’s back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Okay, I guess I need to talk to both of you about inappropriate euphemisms. We can save that for later though. For now, next teams.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alright, my turn!" Shez cheered as she came up. "Hope you're ready to lose!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pretty sure you should talk big only after you win," Emily muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, pretty sure I'm going to win, but you're more than welcome to try and beat me," Shez challenged, getting a competitive smirk from Emily. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Watching from the sidelines as Byleth led the new team of defenders consisting of Petra, Emily, Dedue, and Sylvain, Edelgard couldn't help but feel her suspicions grow as she saw Shez and 'Emily' interact. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was hard to tell; her professor seemed genuinely sincere, so she had trouble imagining she was part of the Slithers but…by her own admission, they just so happened to meet Shez in the woods one day, so it was entirely possible that this was a long term plan Those Who Slithered had made. Not that she would be surprised if it was, as a majority of their plans seemed to involve the long term. However, if that was the case… would her professor be able to fight her sister? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Having Byleth on her side would be a boon she wouldn't readily let go, yet, having her turn her blade against her sister was not something Edelgard was looking forward to, should the younger sister prove to be an imposter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Frowning, she turned her gaze to the attacking team, and took note of Shez talking happily to Annette, Caspar, and Hubert. One thing was certain, no matter what, she had to find out the truth of the matter. Was Shez really the carefree idiot she appeared to be, or was that merely a facade hiding a devious schemer?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, so, I have a plan!” Shez declared to her group, “Me and Caspar will lead the charge while Hubert and Annette blow up the forest with magic!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, alright! Sounds good to me!” Caspar immediately agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Um, by ‘blow up the forest’, do you mean we should use magic to destroy the woods?” Annette asked, “Because that might be more escalation than the professor wants.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, she didn’t say there was a rule against destroying cover, right? Besides, it should probably be fine as long as we don’t set the whole place on fire.” Shez paused. “Unless that would smoke them out more easily?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As impressive as I am sure it would be to see this entire stretch of forest go up in flames, I do believe such a conflagration would almost certainly get us all reprimanded by the professor,” Hubert noted, “I should also point out that if we are throwing around magic strong enough to destroy trees, it would likely do worse to our fellow students were they to be hit inadvertently.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah, that’s true…Well, okay, then we go with the original plan!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Annette blinked. “Uh, what’s the original plan?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Me and Caspar charge in!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Wait, that’s the same plan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but this time we don’t destroy the forest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…but then what do Hubert and I do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s a good question that I don’t have an answer for.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert had to admit, if Shez was indeed an infiltrator from Those Who Slither in the Dark, she was quite skilled at acting like a complete idiot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I think it can still work,” Caspar said, “Like Shez said, me and her can charge in, and then you two can just pick off anyone we don’t get. You’ll be like our support guys!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So we should just follow you two?” Annette asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, you should probably hang back a bit, right? That way if something goes wrong, you can still get the win!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A fair suggestion, and one we should probably take given that we do have a time limit,” Hubert pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “Wait, what? Did we already start?? Oh crap, okay, uh, let’s go with that! And remember, don’t burn down the forest unless it seems like a good idea!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Annette stared as Shez sprinted off into the forest, followed by Caspar, before glancing up at Hubert. “The professor gave us those two as a handicap, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It would make sense, given that we won our previous rounds. Still, we should at least give it our best, correct?” Hubert grinned, walking after his teammates at a sedate pace. “And if it comes down to it, we can always burn the forest down.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, don’t joke about that!” Annette protested, hurrying after him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, kept up her sprint through the forest, her eyes scanning the surrounding area for any hint of threats or ambushes before she came to one particularly big oak with a particularly big guy in front of it. “Heh, hey Dedue!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Shez. You seem excited,” the large Duscuran noted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I’ll be honest, I’ve been wanting to go at you. We haven’t had a chance to spar together yet, and a big part of me wants to see what you can do!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Well, I would prefer not to disappoint,” Dedue said as he took a ready stance with a large axe in his big hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jeez, you can really move fast when you want to, Shez,” Caspar said as he finally caught up to her, before grinning when he saw his teammate facing off against one of their opponents. “Alright, looks like we found one! Do you mind if I take him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ehh, are you sure? Because I was kind of looking forward to this,” Shez said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well if Dedue’s unavailable, maybe I could have this dance?” Sylvain offered as he stepped out from around the tree, a cocky grin on his face and a spear in his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No thanks,” Shez immediately replied, “Caspar, you mind fighting Sylvain instead?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, okay, I guess that can work. Come on Sylvain, let’s see what you’ve got!” Caspar yelled before charging the redhead, who sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m just having no luck with women today, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the meantime, Shez readied herself, taking in the sight of the solid and stalwart Dedue standing in her way and feeling an eager grin come to her face. “So, are you going to come at me, or do I go to you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m the one on defense, if you’ll recall. And you’re running out of time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good point!” And with that decided, Shez sprinted in, sword in hand as she lunged for Dedue, though she didn’t connect, mostly because she had to suddenly turn her thrust into a twist when Emily leaped down from the oak and nearly drop-kicked her in the face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bloodthirsty Eagle landed on her feet and immediately whirled, swinging her sword for Shez’s head and instead catching her sword. “Aw, and here I thought I’d get you with the first move~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cheap! Extremely cheap!” Shez complained, swinging back and getting into a rapid exchange of strikes with a grinning Emily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What can I say? I knew you’d be too distracted going for the big hunk of meat in front of you to notice!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please do not refer to me like that,” Dedue requested as he swung his axe toward Shez’s back, prompting her to disengage and leap back from the pair of defenders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t tell me what to do, beast!” Emily snapped, prompting a frown from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Emily! Not cool!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t call Dedue a beast!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Or what–Ugh, no, shut up, I was going to have fun here!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But Shez instead planted her sword into the dirt, frowning at Emily. “Apologize to Dedue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Are you serious!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Completely! We can fight afterwards!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue, meanwhile, just sighed. “Shez, it is fine. I am used to it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s worse!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are?” Emily actually sounded confused there. “Who else is calling you a beast?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Many people in Faerghus. There are those who still blame the people of Duscur for the Tragedy, even as their eyes have turned towards the Empire as the potential true perpetrators. I have been called worse than a beast before. It does not bother me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh please, like those filth have any room to talk,” Emily scoffed, “Vermin certainly have no right to be calling other beasts the same.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez pinched the bridge of her nose while Dedue gave Emily a bewildered look. “Em, are you saying you called Dedue’s a beast because you think he’s from Faerghus?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, do we really have to keep talking about this? Who cares where he’s from, can’t we get back to fighting now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Dedue didn’t really know what to make of that. He was used to prejudice because he came from Duscur and many people in Faerghus made no secret of their contempt. Seeing the same contempt directed towards the people of Faerghus was…Well, it was different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…okay, but you and me are gonna have to talk after this,” Shez agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uuuuugh, like I don’t get enough of that from Selene…Fine! Fine, we can talk about not calling people beasts or whatever, but first–” And then a ball of magic caught her in the chest and sent her crashing to the ground, right before a blast of wind magic knocked Dedue off his feet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, sorry Dedue!” Annette apologized, “Oh, I hope I didn’t overdo it…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” Dedue answered, pushing himself up into a seated position as his fellow Lion entered the clearing. Along with Hubert, who seemed amused by the truly venomous glare Emily was giving him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for distracting them, Shez. It made our part in the plan quite easy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The plan? There was another plan?” Shez asked, before pausing. “Aw dang it, I didn’t get to fight either of the people I wanted to…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Emily just stared at Shez for a moment, as though trying to see if she genuinely was disappointed or had intentionally tricked her, before letting out an aggravated growl. “You, black-haired mongrel!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert raised an eyebrow. “That’s an interesting thing to call someone of a higher social standing than you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Whatever! Never interfere in one of my fights again!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You realize the point of this exercise was to eliminate the competition, right? You’re the one who insisted on posturing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t posturing! Shez distracted me!” She turned her ire towards Shez. “Which was a dirty trick!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Wait, what was?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Are you genuinely stupid or something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shrugged. “I’m smart in some ways. Anyways, here, lemme help you up. And hey, you still need to apologize to Dedue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert raised an eyebrow at the byplay, especially with how incredulous ‘Emily’ looked when Shez extended a hand out to her. Curiously, after a moment of scowling, she did take the offered hand and let Shez pull her to her feet, before glaring as her possible comrade went over to do the same for Dedue. Not that the large man particularly needed her aid in standing; really, it was more likely he would pull her down if he actually took her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, with Caspar soundly defeating Sylvain in combat, that meant Hubert’s group had indeed succeeded despite their pair of idiots acting as a handicap–Wait. “Where is Petra?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert wasn’t happy to see his question actually prompted a smirk from Emily. “Who knows?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah! We completely forgot about her!” Annette exclaimed, “Quick, start searching the trees!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Wait, what’s going on?” Caspar asked, dragging Sylvain behind him by the redhead’s shirt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Our opponents turned out to be smarter than I expected,” Hubert admitted, before glowering as Emily smirked all the wider.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…no, we probably shouldn’t go with my first plan,” Shez muttered, prompting a frown from Annette.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re not burning down the forest, Shez!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You were going to do what?” Dedue asked, audibly alarmed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was an idea! We weren’t going to actually do it, probably,” Shez explained, which didn’t help soothe Dedue’s concerns at all and garnered a look of interest from Emily. "We can talk about that later, come on, if we can hurry up, we can find her!" </span>

  <span>So, turns out Petra had just…left the forest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The professor never said we had to stay," Petra explained, looking quite proud of herself when she greeted her fellow students once they left the forest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...That feels like cheating," Annette muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It isn't," Byleth interjected. "If we're sent to eliminate a group, then even a single person escaping can be a loss, and most opponents won't stick around if they think they've lost. That is the benefit for those on the defense. It may seem like they're losing, but ultimately it is the attackers that have to hunt them down, meaning the defenders are able to choose how to defend. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ambushing, facing straight on, hiding, or running away are all valid options when on the back foot in combat, and these are all options your opponent can take," Byleth explained as she turned to face the classes, "I hope you all made sure to pay attention during those matches, as it will be important for tomorrow's lesson. I want you all to give me a brief summarization of a tactic you would use if you were in charge of the attacking squad tomorrow, where Hanneman and I shall discuss the merits and cons of such a plan." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, if I may, will we be only performing this type of scenario?" Edelgard asked once Byleth was done speaking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, we shall also be attempting other scenarios, but those shall remain a surprise for now," Byleth responded before nodding, "If there are no other questions, class is dismissed." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, may we be speaking with one another?" Petra asked as the students began to head back to the monastery. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, did you need something?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I felt it appropriate we speak over matters of anger," Petra said once it was just the two of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, yeah, it would be good to do that," Byleth replied, before gesturing over to a nearby tree. "Do you want to sit down?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you would like, professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I would." Walking over to the tree, the two sat together underneath it, a moment of silence passing over them before Byleth spoke. "Would you like to talk about what happened during the session?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is foolish, a moment of anger that I should have controlled," Petra said, shaking her head. "I am used to being spoken of as though I am stupid." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I haven't heard anyone at the academy speaking about you like that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, it was before. When I was being sent to the Empire I was…treated like a strange beast. Things have changed, I have met people who treat me equal." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And you don't like that they were being insulted." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You have been treating us all with much kindness, even when it is not being returned. So even if I am being called stupid, you should not be called so." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're not stupid. You can speak two languages, that's more than pretty much everyone in the academy," Byleth said, smiling at Petra. "You also came up with great plans that I didn't even expect." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have much kindness to be saying so.” Petra smiled back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you. And…I think I should be honest with you about something. I fought in the Dagda and Brigid war.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Petra blinked, her smile dropping. “...Oh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I thought that might make things complicated. It’s why I wanted to mention it instead of letting you find out on your own.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I have understanding. You are wanting to be honest. I am wishing to ask…how were you–...what was your…” She grimaced, closing her eyes for a moment as she tried to think of the right words. Byleth just waited, letting her think. “...What were you doing in the war?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My father was hired by Count Varley to defend his lands, though we actually fought some of your countrymen before that. A scouting party found our camp and attacked us. I guess they thought we might be a war camp or they just had orders to kill anyone they ran into.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…I am…unhappy to be hearing that. You were…I am knowing that my countrymen were fighting and killing. Is…Were people of your camp killed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. A man named Dalton died on our side. I killed six people that day. Shez killed one too, after he managed to stab her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah. You are having anger then, because your friend did die and your sister took injury?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth sighed, leaning back against the wood. “I don’t know if anger is the right emotion. I was worried, I think. I didn’t…I don’t feel emotions the same way most people do. It’s difficult for me to feel them properly. I didn’t feel real anger until later, but that’s a different story. I saw Shez fall, and I just had to get to her, so I killed everyone between me and her. And then, since my father took the job to fight for Count Varley, I killed more people from Brigid. Some from Dagda too, but it was rare to fight them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm…The warriors of Brigid were doing scouting. The Dagda were doing conquering. They were arriving with big ships and many weapons and armor. They had planning, I think, but they did failing instead.” Petra let out a sigh of her own, drawing her knees up to her chest. “...My father was fighting. He did die too. I am not faulting you for defending your family, professor. It does feel hurt though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“After that first time, I wasn’t defending my family, I was doing a job. I was a mercenary, Petra, and that means I killed your countrymen for coin,” Byleth responded, “Most of our jobs did involve protecting smaller villages, but it was still a job. There wasn’t any noble sentiment behind it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Petra laughed without much humor. “Nobles do not have much sentiment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...A lot of them don’t, that’s true. It’s not a position that lets them be sentimental. I have no idea why anyone would want to live like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is having responsibility. Some nobles are kind. Duke Gerth was very kind to me. Other Eagles are very kind as well.” She frowned slightly. “Lions are not as kind. They are more rude.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I might need to talk with them about that. Or maybe I should talk with Hanneman. They’re his class…Anyway, that was what I wanted to say.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I am having difficulty being thankful, professor. It is complicating to know you have…To know you have killed people of Brigid. Even if it was in war.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s fine. I’ve killed a lot of people, Petra. I don’t expect forgiveness for it. I just want to be honest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Honesty is causing pain sometimes, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. It does that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Petra glanced down at the grass. “...How many were you killing in the war?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I personally killed twenty-seven people in the time we participated in the war.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Petra couldn’t help but stare at her professor, who said such a thing completely calmly. “...I-I have understanding. That is…many.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is.” Byleth leaned forward, staring towards the monastery. “I think I’ve killed over a hundred people so far. I was fifteen then, and I’m twenty now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah. You have seen much death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m responsible for most of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You do not have responsibility for war, professor. That is the responsibility of kings and queens, not warriors.” She wasn’t completely sure why, but Petra felt something compel her to ask. “What age did you have when you killed first?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was fourteen. It was a job to take care of some poachers at a small village in the Alliance, though I was just supposed to be a lookout along with Shez. Some poachers got into the village and Shez went in after them. One caught her, and he was choking her when I cut his head off.” Byleth tilted her head, thinking. “I think that was the first time I was worried.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not angry?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. Like I said, that’s a different story.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I would be wanting to hear this story, if it is not trouble, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded, then explained her time in Faerghus, when she met Ashe and Lonato, and when Catherine nearly killed her. By the end, Petra’s eyes were wide.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So that is why you were beating Instructor Jeritza. You remembered Lonato and were made angry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Very angry. But I’m working on it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You are working on it. You are working on anger?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m trying to fix it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do not think anger is a thing to be fixing. Anger is to be felt. You can control anger, yet I do not think you can fix anger. It is not broken.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s a good point,” Byleth admitted. “...Emotions are difficult.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I am thinking language is difficult. Emotions are felt. They are difficult to express.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Emotions are difficult when you don’t feel them,” she replied, before pushing herself up, “Okay, I think we should head back now. I hope I didn’t make things awkward between us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Petra stared up at her professor, considering the woman in front of her. It was hard for her to admit, even to herself, but she couldn’t help but look at her professor differently now, knowing Byleth had killed her countrymen. But, then, she already knew that her professor was a mercenary, and that she had blood on her hands. That wasn’t a difficult expression to understand; looking at Byleth, Petra couldn’t help but picture her with blood dripping from her fingers, soaked in crimson all the way up to her elbows.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yet, she also knew her professor was kind. So she extended a hand towards her, asking without words for her help in standing up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And her professor took her hand without hesitation and pulled her to her feet. Her hand was warm, even with the imaginary blood soaking it. So Petra gave her professor a reassuring squeeze and a smile, to let her know that, even if things were complicated, she still liked her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was sure the meaning came across because her professor smiled back as they made their way back up to the monastery.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Hey Dedue!” Shez called out once she spotted her huge pal. Which wasn’t hard, since he was still one of the tallest people she’d ever met. He might actually be the tallest, thinking about it, but the point was, he was very easy to spot and head over to!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue paused, not expecting anyone to call out to him when he was eating, and glanced up from his bowl of stew. A slight frown crossed his face when he noticed who was accompanying Shez, but he was used to interacting with unpleasant people and he concealed it easily enough. “Hello Shez. Good evening, Lady Emily.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who’re you calling lady?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Well, that was different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez elbowed her friend, frowning at her. “Hey, come on, you’re being nice, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh. Fine. Good evening sir whatever of wherever,” Korsch grunted back at Dedue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I am not a nobleman, Lady Emily. I have no titles you might need to refer to me with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh great, so I’m allowed to be rude to you?” she asked, derision dripping with every word before she moved out of the way of another elbow. “Ha! Better luck next time!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to be really difficult about this, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure am!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez rolled her eyes before setting down her own plate of fish and settling in across from Dedue. “So, hey, sorry if we’re disturbing your dinner, I just thought Emily should apologize for being a bitch earlier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” While Dedue could agree with Shez’s assessment, he was fairly certain verbally agreeing would be worse for him in the long run.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh so now I’m a bitch, huh?” Korsch complained as she sat next to Shez, though she sounded less hostile when she was interacting with the mercenary than with, well, anyone else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup,” was Shez’s blunt response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. Well what about you, you big…brute. What do you think of me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t call him a brute either,” Shez chided.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well what should I call him, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How about his name?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like I know what that is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seriously? Ugh, maybe this was a bad idea...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue could have told her that had she asked. It wasn’t his place to though, so he just went back to his stew. Hopefully Korsch would just get bored and leave–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He glanced up, the spoon still at his lips as Korsch spoke up again. “...?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s your name?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” He set the spoon back down. “My name is Dedue Molinaro.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dedue Molinaro,” she repeated, sounding out the syllables with a faint frown, “Okay, there, I know what his name is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Do you want a cookie?” Shez asked, “Em, that’s something really basic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah well I never needed to bother before now, so get off my back!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t need to know people’s names?? I mean, I know I’m bad with names sometimes but do you just never ask?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretty much. If I don’t know someone’s name already, either they’re vermin I shouldn’t care about or they’re a dreg who’s already beneath me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, Dedue could give Korsch one thing: she was more honest in her prejudices than most nobles he had interacted with. It didn’t make her any more pleasant, but at least she was open about being terrible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez seemed to be reevaluating her opinion of the other girl, so at least something positive was coming out of this. “...Yeah, this was a bad idea. Uh, sorry about this, Dedue. I kind of hoped, uh…well, yeah, sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Hey! Why are you acting like I failed here!?” Korsch whined.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Apologizing to someone isn’t something you can pass or fail, Em! You either do it or you don’t, and you haven’t! Look, just…okay, you like fighting, right? Hunting, getting stronger, all that stuff? Well just think of this like you’re getting stronger in social stuff!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Korsch frowned, before glaring down at the table. Shez, meanwhile, gave an apologetic look to Dedue and mouthed “I’m sorry” to him. He just nodded back to her, accepting the apology, before looking at Korsch again. He didn’t particularly like the idea of being used as “social practice” for an aggressive noble, but a part of him was curious what she might say now that she’d been called out so directly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the very least, he could keep eating while she settled her inner turmoil.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After some more silence, Korsch finally looked up at him. “...I’m sorry I called you a beast.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue’s eyebrows raised. He genuinely wasn’t expecting her to actually manage to apologize to him. He could count the number of nobles that had on one hand and still have fingers left over. “...Apology accepted, Lady Emily.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Stop calling me Lady. It’s annoying.” Well, the contrition didn’t last long. “Please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He blinked. It seemed he was two for two in things he’d never expected a prejudiced noble to ever say to him. Though he shouldn’t give her too much credit, given how she clearly said it as an afterthought. “If that is what you want, Emily.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Thanks.” Alright, now he was clearly hearing things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Or not, given Shez clearly grinned at her friend’s “progress”. She nudged Korsch’s shoulder and gave the frowning girl a thumbs up when she glowered at her, something that made Korsch pause before glancing away from her, seeming embarrassed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which, well…since she was attempting to extend her hand in peace, he may as well reciprocate. Even if it was clearly at the behest of her friend. “How has school been going for you, Emily?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, it sucks. I hate it here and this whole place makes my skin crawl.” He didn’t expect that answer, though perhaps he should have. Korsch seemed to hate a number of things from what he could tell of his few interactions with her, so it was a surprise to see she liked Shez, who appeared to be a generally outgoing and friendly person. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though perhaps those friendly qualities were what allowed her to befriend the surly girl to begin with?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…well, hey, what about classes?” Shez asked, “How’s By been treating you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, her. She keeps trying to involve me in stuff. I’m not that coward, Varley, I don’t need to be coaxed from my burrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, don’t be mean to Bernadetta either!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not! I barely interact with her! Besides, you’re the one she’s terrified of.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…Yeah, I’m still not sure why that is. It can’t be because of Byleth, because I’m pretty sure Bernie warmed up to her at this point…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe she caught a peek of your true nature, hm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, hm…yeah, maybe that would do it? Lots of people were wary of me after the mock battle…which is fair, since I completely kicked ass there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue continued to watch the byplay between the two girls as he finished his stew. He preferred eating alone when he wasn’t with his highness and he didn’t particularly like Korsch, but he could derive a little amusement from the duo’s banter. Though a thought did occur to him. “Emily, have you had dinner yet?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Korsch paused, glancing up at him– “Ugh, you’re a tall bastard. How haven’t the rest of those blue beasts broken their necks yet trying to make eye contact with you?”     </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? A lion is a beast, isn't it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'll let it slide this time, just call them Lions next time," Shez said while glaring at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh, fine, and no, I don't eat the food here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really?" Shez asked, a bit surprised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You really should eat something, Emily,” Dedue commented, “Even if you were only in one of the training sessions, you still expended a lot of energy."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't need a nanny telling me what I already know. I just don't see why I should eat here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Look, I can get wanting to hunt down your own meal or something, but you really should just eat here. Here, the food is usually good." Skewering a bit of fish on a fork, Shez lifted it up for Emily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey, stop, I don't need you to fe–" Emily was cut off as Shez shoved her fork in her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"See?" Shez asked with a smile as Emily slowly chewed on the food in her mouth. "You might not like it here but you might as well en–Hey!" With a start, Shez nearly jumped back in surprise as Emily immediately reached over to grab a fistful of her fish so she could eat more. "I only offered you some, get your own food!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily seemed to make some type of response, yet it was completely muffled by the food in her mouth as she tried to reach for more. Dedue could only watch on in silence as the two began to fight over the food, the plate being tugged back and forth between them.                                                </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Perhaps you two–" And before he could get them to stop, the plate went flying, the remains of the two fish saute soaring in the air. The trio could only watch on in horror as if in slow motion the food arched in the air and landed right on Seteth as he was walking by. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Slowly turning towards them with fish in his hair, Seteth glared at the students. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...H-Hey there," Shez greeted with an awkward smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily, on the other hand, chose to immediately run. Not that she was able to get away as Seteth was able to chase her down. The chamberlain could move surprisingly quickly when he wanted to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue could only sigh as he found himself being reprimanded alongside the two troublemakers. At least he had already finished his meal beforehand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a far longer lecture than he personally thought was necessary for two girls fighting over a plate of fish, Dedue was finally allowed to leave and head back to his room for the night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Dedue!” Or not, since Shez ran up to him immediately after he started leaving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Shez. Did you need something else?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, well, sort of? I just…I wanted to say I’m sorry again. Well, actually say I’m sorry, verbally, so you can hear it. I was trying to make things right, but I ruined your dinner–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You didn't. I ate well enough even with Emily’s presence. I’m used to people like her…though I will admit, she’s the first person I’ve met whose prejudice extends to the whole of Faerghus and not just Duscur.” He made a mental note to keep Emily from interacting with Ingrid, if at all possible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still! I basically used you as a prop to sort out Emily’s issues, and that wasn’t nice of me at all. So I wanna make it up to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You really don’t have to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I want to. You’re my friend too, and friends do nice things for each other. So name something and I’ll help you out with it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue raised an eyebrow at the strange girl. “...I honestly can’t think of anything I would need your aid with. I do not mean that as a slight against you, I just tend to prefer solitude most days.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…Well, what about if I take you out for dinner then? Not at the mess hall, but somewhere fancy!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue blinked. “...I do not think that is the best idea, Shez. I mentioned before what sort of rumors might spread if you are seen in my presence.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez scoffed. “Please, like I care about that. If I hear someone talking bad about either of us, I’ll just punch them! People already know I’m a dangerous mercenary, so I’ll just coast off of that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Dedue sighed, trying not to smile. “I still think this is a bad idea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I think it’s a great one. Come on, say yes!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Very well, if you insist.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! Alright, uh, I guess we should do this on our next free day or something? Eh, we can figure out the specifics later. For now, you just think of where you’d like to go and I’ll make it happen!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Very well, I shall look forward to it." Dedue said, nodding to her before he made his way back to his room. Perhaps it wasn't as bad of a dinner as he initially thought. </span>

  <span>Letting out a sigh, Dorothea leaned back in the chair she was sitting in and stretched her arms over her head. A part of her noted the stares she received as she did so, but she was more focused on the papers in front of her. Now, while Dorothea would never call herself dumb, she did also know she would inevitably start off far behind her classmates when it came to certain aspects of the academy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sure, she was handy with a sword, was pretty confident in her magic skills, and even knew how to wield a dagger just in case. However, as a commoner there were things she would never have been able to practice beforehand. Horses, pegasi, and by extension wyverns were something she had already accepted were not going to be her forte, especially since she could barely get on a horse without falling off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which led to her current conundrum: tactics. Yes, she had played the role of a tactical leader beforehand in some smaller plays, but that didn't involve any actual planning, and, if anything, was more focused on the charismatic aspect of said leader. As such, she couldn't help but be stumped as she tried to figure out what to do for the assignment Byleth had given her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… if it were our class… would Caspar be a good choice? He's small, but he is loud… well, this is just an assignment, so maybe I could send Ferdie first. It's not like he'd actually get hurt., Dorothea mused, finding some slight enjoyment as she remembered Ferdinand getting pelted by a rock. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me, Dorothea." Blinking as she was broken out of her thoughts, the diva looked over her shoulder to see Edelgard standing behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, hello Edie, to what do I owe the pleasure~?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wanted to ask for your assistance, if you were not busy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh? And how exactly could I help the Emperor-to-be?" Dorothea asked with a teasing tone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I actually wanted to ask for your advice on the assignment," Edelgard said, getting Dorothea to pause. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...you want to ask me for help?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I feel like your help would be the most helpful given my own failings during the exercise," Edelgard explained as she sat down with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As I said, yes. I… was not able to control the team well, and regardless of the tensions between the nations, I should have taken charge. Whereas you were able to take command quite easily during the exercise." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks for the nice words, Edie, but I'm pretty sure that's because of who I was teamed up with. Dedue and Ashe were born commoners, and Bernie is just a sweet girl in general. If I ended up with your team, it would have been a mess." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Be that as it may, you still showed excellent initiative. As such, I would like to… know how to be more personable, like you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I admit that my words may not be the most gentle, and I certainly do not want to end up coddling anyone, but… at the very least an Emperor is one who needs to be charismatic. Hence why I wish to learn from you, if possible." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well… if you're going to ask so nicely, how can I say no? Though I hope you don't mind helping me out as well~" Dorothea said, looking down at the sheet in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I would gladly help. I've actually prepared a few different examples, so I'm sure I can assist with that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wow, you actually did multiple?" Dorothea asked, amused. "Really trying to impress the professor, huh~?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-hm, I don't know what you mean. As the future Emperor I must prepare multiple means of attack whenever I am in charge," Edelgard said, blushing as she cleared her throat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you say so~" Dorothea teased, "Well, if you want to help, I was wondering who I should have in the lead. Petra seems like a good option with how quick she can be, but I'd rather not send her up by herself." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then why not send me along as well?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh? Really? I mean… not that I'm underestimating you, but you are royalty and all. Pretty sure it'd look bad if I tried sending you to the frontlines." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In combat, titles mean nothing," Edelgard responded. "When I'm up against someone who is willing to kill, whether I am a commoner or the emperor won't matter to them. It also shouldn't matter to whoever is the field commander, as they should ensure to use all their soldiers in ways that would best suit them. For example, I may not be as large as Dedue, but I am focusing on wearing heavy armor in combat, so I would be best suited at the frontlines since I won't be moving as quickly as anyone else."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Wow Edie, hearing you say that is kind of impressive," Dorothea said, grinning. "You already seem quite charismatic to me~"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you think so? Hm, perhaps you could explain what you mean by that? I'm sure the professor would be willing to understand why you were unable to finish the assignment if we focus on this." A moment of silence passed over the two. "I'm kidding, of course." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, you know, I got the feeling but you were so serious during that that it was hard to tell," Dorothea admitted. "I can see why you want advice on how to be more 'personable', as it were. The aspiring leader looking to change the world might not have the most experience when it comes to dealing with those below her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I would not put it like that. At the academy we are all equals. Yes, I may be the house leader, but we all have our own advantages and disadvantages. For example, despite his… rather lethargic way of doing things, Linhardt is surprisingly skilled at faith magic… almost infuriatingly so with how lackadaisical he is. Whereas the two of us aren't that skilled in it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea had to stop herself from giggling at the irritation evident in her voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That is quite the mystery, Lin certainly doesn't seem like the type to have a lot of faith, yet he somehow is able to wield it like a natural holy man. And neither of us will be quite as good with the bow compared to Bernie." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah… yes, it can be very difficult using a bow if I keep breaking them by accident," Edelgard said, blushing a bit. "Regardless, it is like I said, we are all equals, and I hope to be able to rely on you in the future." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, you really should save those words for the professor, you know~" Dorothea teased, getting Edelgard to blush again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-How about we focus on the assignment for now?" Edelgard asked, as Dorothea decided to relent. She didn't want poor Edie to overheat, after all~<br /></span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Humming to herself as she walked the halls of Garreg Mach, Dorothea found herself in quite the happy mood. It took a bit of head scratching, but she was able to come up with a simple yet effective plan. Not to mention she was able to hang out with Edie, which was never a bad thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The princess might seem a bit overbearing at times, but knowing someone so high up was willing to see her as more than just a songstress definitely made her happy. If only she wasn't already interested in someone else, or Dorothea would have tried to work her charms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"See you later Emily!" Hearing Shez’s voice, Dorothea looked over to see the mercenary waving as she walked away from Dorothea’s classmate. Hm… well, Dorothea hadn't really tried to talk with the minor noble often, but if she could get along with Shez, maybe she wasn't that bad? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there Emily~" Grinning, she approached the noble, who turned around at her voice. And almost immediately her eyes changed into a glare. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What do you want?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Right, she should have expected that. "I just wanted to say hi." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, well if that's all, then I'm going," Emily said, walking away without another word. Letting out an irritated sigh, Dorothea reminded herself that not every noble was like her nicer classmates. It wasn't anything new, but at least Emily didn't pretend to like her just to get what she wanted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Continuing her walk, Dorothea tried to move past that. Which thankfully was rather easy as she stumbled upon her professor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Dorothea, hello, I was looking for you. Did you want some tea?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? You wanted to have tea with me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I had tea with Edelgard before, and I realized it would probably be good to have tea with other students as well. Would you like to have some together?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I'm not going to say no~" Dorothea said with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good. Do you mind if I ask what your preferred blends are?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… well, I am in the mood for some sweet apple blend," Dorothea said, as they began to make their way to the tea gardens. She also had to admit, it was cute seeing her professor try to prepare the tea, carefully pouring the hot water into the pot with the blend of leaves. "Haven't prepared tea much before, huh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, not really. This is only the third time I've had some. Though I made sure to read up on how to prepare this properly," Byleth said, as she let the tea sit for a moment, "I also brought some sweets, though they're only cookies." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't mind, professor~" Dorothea replied, grinning as she took one of the offered treats. "Hm~ Did you buy these from the shop we went to last time?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, they were tasty so I wanted to get some more," Byleth answered, taking one herself. "I would have gotten more but my funds are actually getting a bit low." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh? Didn't have much saved up during your time as a mercenary?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, I had a decent amount saved up," Byleth elaborated as she began to pour the tea. "The funds the church gives aren't much, so I have to use my own money when it comes to preparing everyone for the missions." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Eh?" That caught Dorothea off guard as she stared at her professor. "...So, when you gave everyone a new set of gear and armor before our first mission…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My own money. The church's funds, a thousand gold, was only able to pay for half of that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...huh. You know, I knew the church could be stingy, but I didn't think it'd be that bad," Dorothea said with a huff. "Though, you really don't need to go that far professor. I'm sure no one would be happy if you ended up broke because of this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I just want to make sure all of you are okay," Byleth replied, sipping from the tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Still, you should make sure to be ready for the future," Dorothea lightly chided, before smiling. "Ah, but how about we discuss something light?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… ah, how about the opera? I was only there once, so I'd like to know more." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That I can completely understand~ The opera is certainly a wonderful place to be. Sure, we might get a bit catty, but all of us in the opera company look out for one another." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That makes sense. It's kind of like Jeralt’s mercenaries." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose? I wouldn't have much experience in that regard so I'll take your word for it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And I'll do the same for you," Byleth said, a small smile on her face, looking a tad too stiff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come now professor, you don't need to force yourself to smile around me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, it's not really forcing," Byleth responded, looking a bit sheepish. "It's…difficult to smile naturally, even when I feel happy. So I try to put one on whenever it feels appropriate." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… you know, your sister did say you have a hard time expressing yourself, not that there's anything wrong with that. However, if you would like some advice, then I would say to keep your body relaxed. It may be subtle, but you stiffened up when you tried to smile." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh… thank you," Byleth said, nodding at her. "You're pretty good at reading body language." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It comes with the territory~ Aside from making sure my acting is believable, being able to read someone else means I know how to act around them. Someone might act shy, but their posture, and where their eyes might wander, can let me know that with a wink and a smile they'll be putty in anyone's hands."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see… well, I can understand how reading someone can be helpful, but I tend to do so from a combat perspective." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, but a conversation can be quite the battlefield as well~ Though I understand what you mean, and it's not like I didn't learn how to fight, my seniors at the opera company made sure I knew how to. Though I only recently learned how to use magic." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You did?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yup, I managed to butter up a noble into giving me some magic tomes after I planned on joining the academy. Took some hard work, but I like to think it was worth it," Dorothea said, unashamedly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I would say so. It can be difficult to learn how to use magic, even more so for commoners, so it says much about you that you were able to do so on your own." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well… Manuela did tell me a few things when she was still at Mittlefrank, so it wasn't completely on my own," Dorothea admitted, blushing a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even so, it's impressive," Byleth said with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-hm, no need to praise me so much. I mean, you already know the reason why I'm here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And? Should it matter that you want to get married?" Byleth asked, a bit confused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, most people would look down on someone trying to marry into wealth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...hm." Setting her cup down, Byleth thought for a moment. "You're working hard, and even if you do want to marry to life in leisure, you still put the effort in classes and during the missions. Even if you weren't, your dream is your dream, there's no reason to look down on you for it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Geez, you sure are a smooth talker, professor," Dorothea said, blushing a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you?" she responded, getting Dorothea to giggle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh professor, you really should be careful, lest you turn into a heartbreaker." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…is that a metaphor?" Byleth asked, the sincerity making Dorothea laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing to worry about professor. Ah, though it seems we've had quite the conversation, the teapot is already empty," Dorothea said, amused at how quickly time passed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I guess we should end it here then? Unless you want more." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe some other time~" Grinning, Dorothea got up, ready to leave, only for Byleth to stop her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Before you go, I did have something for you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Despite how my sister can be, she is right about giving flowers when you enjoy a performance." Reaching into her coat, Byleth brought out a wrapped lily. "It may be a few years late, but here you go." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh my, thank you professor~" Grinning, Dorothea took the flower as Byleth got up, collecting the items on the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to thank me, though I hope I get to see you again on stage." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe one day~? After all, who knows what the future holds~?" </span>

  <p>
  <span>“Hey Selene!” Emily called out the instant she spotted the priestess in question working amid the shelves of the library, prompting a sigh from Selene and several shushes from the monks around that she completely ignored.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Lady Korsch,” Selene greeted as she turned towards the younger woman, “Is there a reason you wished to speak with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well after how </span>
  <em>
    <span>helpful</span>
  </em>
  <span> you were the last time I had a ‘personal issue’, I thought we should talk again! You were so nice and thoughtful and all that, I just had to come by again! Especially since you helped resolve all those problems I was having!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Selene raised an eyebrow at the overly cheerful girl, who still wasn’t nearly as subtle as she thought she was. “Alright then. I don’t have much to do right now, anyway. Though I do have to ask, wasn’t the choir festival today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh please, like I’m going to that stupid thing.” Ah, and there was the usual surliness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Very well, I shall have to speak with you about that later, but for now, we can speak about your personal issue." Gesturing for her to follow, Selene led Emily into the private room they had used before, making sure to lock the door behind them. "If you weren't still so idiotic, I'd commend you for coming to me rather than Tomas again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, I'm not an idiot! I actually have some valuable information!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You do?" Selene asked, evidently not believing her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah! I actually got info about that Shez girl!" Kronya said, quite proud of herself. "She says was stationed in Ordelia before infiltrating those mercs, and that her minder was someone called Periander." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Periander? Hm… that name sounds familiar…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure it does, but it seems that she doesn't have any specific mission at the moment. Aside from making a name for herself, it looks like that girl is looking to get a promotion if she can," Kronya said with a chuckle, before she frowned. "She's very annoying about how to 'properly' act around the beasts though." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, it's almost as if we're trying to remain hidden while we are here," Bias chided as she frowned too. "Speaking of missions, I do believe you're supposed to be getting close to the princess, not a different infiltrator." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey! I'm doing my job! She's sisters with the professor of the Empire class, and that imperial beast is clearly trying to get the mercenary on her side! So if I get close to the professor by using Shez, then I'll get closer to the princess!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...so your plan is to use a student from a different class, rather than approach the professor of your own class?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s a difference! Shez already has an in with the professor, I’d just be some random student trying to cozy up to her otherwise!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you don’t think the professor might take notice that you’re attempting to get close to her by using her sister?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please, like that dull-eyed beast would notice anything–...” To Bias’s surprise, Kronya actually frowned at herself and seemed to be thinking. “...no, you have a point. My way should still work though. If I was coming up to the professor otherwise, I’d just be another student, but if I’m friends with her ‘sister’ then she’ll open up easier. Besides, I can’t just go up to the princess, she’s already suspicious of me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…That was well-reasoned. Alright, I accept and approve of your plan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. LIke I need your approval…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You do, unless you want to talk to Tomas again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Whatever, I get it. You know, I wouldn’t even need to do all this if our new ‘glorious leaders’ didn’t let the princess slip her leash to begin with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We wouldn’t need to do a lot of things if things just went perfectly. Blame that dastard Aegir for turning on us before Thales’s body was even cold.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya scowled at the reminder. “And why haven’t we killed him yet?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>We</span>
  </em>
  <span> haven’t done anything because it isn’t our assignment. If you want to ask Myson or Chilon why they haven’t dealt with him, go ahead and ask. I doubt they’ll be happy with the question though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph…fine, whatever. I should get out of here anyway, don’t want the vermin to notice I ditched their ‘sacred’ choir practice," Kronya said, scowling as she got ready to leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well at least you have the sense to return there," Bias said as she unlocked the door. "Do try not to blow your cover." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not an idiot!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She certainly could have fooled Bias with how she acted. Honestly, she wished she didn't have to deal with any of these idiots, especially not a petulant brat who barely knew how to hide herself, but she had her own personal mission to deal with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'll make those dastards pay, Pittacus," she muttered, thinking of her twin as she turned back the library shelves. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Hubert, can I speak with you?" Byleth asked once she found her student after the choir festival. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? I hope this isn't about my singing professor,” the gaunt young man commented, “I did tell you beforehand that I would sing solemnly."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not that. I wanted to ask your advice about something." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh? Is this about tactics involving the mission? I do remember you being quite pleased with my idea of smoking out those hiding, though I must admit I may have gotten inspiration from your sister." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wanted to ask what Edelgard likes." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert raised an eyebrow. "Oh? Is there any particular reason why?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's her birthday in a few weeks right? I wasn't sure what to get her, so I wanted to check with you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, I suppose I should feel honored then." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I guess. I just want to make sure you don't stab me if I get her something bad." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come now professor, no need for jokes like that." Poisoning on the other hand… "Why not get her flowers? It is a common gift to give for one's birthday." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… you're right, but it feels like I should get her something different, you know? She is the house leader, and has helped me greatly despite my short time here so far," Byleth explained, "I know Dorothea wants to take her out into the town again, so it doesn't need to be a big gift." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Does she?" Hm, he may need to speak with Lady Edelgard. She may have more freedom thanks to Thales being dead and gone, and good riddance to the vile bastard, but she still had a war to prepare for. Spending too much of her time dilly dallying about could backfire on her. "Well, why not invite her to another sparring session? Lady Edelgard did seem to take your lesson to heart after that first spar you had, so I'm sure she'll appreciate it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I guess? Not a bad idea but…hm." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, I must say I never thought I would see a legendary mercenary be stumped about getting someone a gift. Here I thought you'd be able to trust your instincts." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...My instincts…” Byleth adopted a thinking pose, before nodding to herself. “I see. Thank you, Hubert, I think I have an idea now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am glad to hear that. I am here to help, after all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re very good at making innocuous statements sound very menacing. Good work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert smirked, unafraid to show his amusement as the professor walked off. It did feel nice to be praised for his efforts, though it wasn’t about to stop him from checking to make sure the professor wasn’t about to harm her highness through whatever gift she bought. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Staying silent as he followed his professor from a distance, Hubert meticulously noted everything she did. Everything from who she talked to, to what she ate, and what she did in her free time. To some, his efforts might seem a bit much, but for a retainer of a future emperor, this was the bare minimum to ensure her safety. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It certainly gave him an interesting perspective on the professor as she went about her day to day, that was for sure. For starters, it was almost amusing how much she seemed to enjoy eating when she invited students to dine with her. Four different meals in such a short time was quite the sight. He would have been impressed if the last meal didn't involve her waving him over to eat with her and Linhardt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No matter, it just meant he had to get better at his stealth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And thankfully for him, the lessons they were doing were perfect for that as he was able to have perfectly legitimate reasons to practice following someone in secret thanks to the training sessions. He had to admit, he may have taken more pleasure than necessary at sneaking up to someone right when they thought they were about to win just to scare them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, he wouldn't be so arrogant as to believe his efforts would be enough to avoid notice from the professor, so he made sure to follow from a further distance next chance he had. Sure, he wouldn't be able to hear what she said, but he could still see what she was doing. Such as her spending time with students with other houses, like the Edmund girl as the two had tea together, or a sparring session with that apprentice of her father's. He was a tad surprised to see her inviting Seteth’s sister to a meal though. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was certain that Professor Eisner had no love for the Church, so her choosing to spend time with someone who had such a close relationship with a leader of the church was unexpected. Perhaps because she believed her to only be a small child? Still, it was something he would make note of, just in case. And it seemed that after spending time around the academy, she was finally heading out to town, which meant it was time to see what she was going to buy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At least, that's what he thought as she instead went to spend some time with the ruffians from her mercenary company. He did have to admit, getting them on Lady Edelgard’s side would certainly be helpful. After all, those serving under a legendary knight like Jeralt must be strong as well, no? Even if they did appear to be idiotic, such as the bald one loudly saying she's “has it made easy” with all the nobles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Honestly, it wasn't a surprise she and her sister were quite the odd pai- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Mind telling me what you're doing following Byleth around?" A voice from behind him said, getting Hubert to whip around to see the scruffy looking man from Byleth’s band. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Heh. I suppose I can’t convince you that this was just a coincidence?” Hubert asked as he tried to calm his racing heart. It had been a very long time since anyone had ever snuck up behind him and the prideful part of him felt wounded that he was so easily caught by a commoner. He should be better than that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well you can’t if you start the conversation like that,” the man replied with a lazy smile. He reminded Hubert of some of the people he had worked with in the past, those who operated in the darker parts of society. He had the same look in his eyes, the gaze of someone entirely comfortable with the idea of committing murder without hesitation. “Relax, kid. I’m not going to kill you because you’re a student of the Academy and that would screw over Byleth, just like you’re not going to kill me because it would screw up your own position.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t know about that. A mercenary’s life is filled with dangers, after all. You never know what could happen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True, the world’s a dangerous place. An academy student could go missing pretty easily.” His smiled widened. “But that’s not going to happen, right? Because here I am to keep you safe, kid. You’re one of Byleth’s students, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am, yes. Does that afford me some free protection, mercenary?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You bet it does. Her job is to look out for you kids, so that means you’re under our protection by extension.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert smiled, smothering whatever annoyance he might have felt. The man was a killer, but he wouldn’t kill Hubert. Not here and now, at least. “You would be one of Jeralt the Blade Breaker’s officers then. If I may guess…you would be Ezra.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ezra whistled. “Wow, I’m impressed. You got that completely wrong, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert blinked. “...Ah…No, I don’t think I did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, you’re right, I was just fucking with you. Good on you for not believing me. Skepticism’s handy in our line of work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Our?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ezra grinned. “You’ve got the eyes of a killer, kid. Am I wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. Should I take that to mean you are the professor’s protector?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope. If I wanted to preen, I might call myself her mentor, but her dad’s got a far better claim to that title than I do, and that’s not counting the other mercs that helped out. Either way, she doesn’t need much protection these days. All that to say, it’s nice to meetcha, Hubert. Byleth’s talked a lot about you kids.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” It was deeply annoying having his own trick turned around on him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, no need to get annoyed, kid. None of the other ‘officers’ noticed you and I’m the type of guy who keeps his eyes out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert huffed in some amusement. He could recognize the peace offering for what it was. A part of him was still considering how he could kill Ezra with no one being any the wiser, but he did that for everyone he interacted with. A larger part of him was more interested in the potential for this man to be an asset to her highness, and that part further noted that gaining the professor’s loyalty would most likely bring this man right along with her. It was almost funny; without Those Who Slither breathing down her highness’s neck, he had more reason to consider people as assets than as liabilities. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, if they turned out to be the latter, he would still do what needed to be done. “Very well then. May I take my leave then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, I did what I wanted to do anyway.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He raised an eyebrow. “And that would be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Distracting you long enough for Byleth to leave.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh.” Well now he was irritated again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, you can run off now. Nice chatting with you, and feel free to keep Jeralt’s Mercenaries in mind if you want any work done.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Very well, Ezra. I will certainly keep your mercenary band in mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, c’mon kid, don’t go back to the threats or I’ll have to escalate this by introducing you to the other mercs and saying you’re following Byleth because you have a crush on her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert blinked. “...You are a cruel and vile man.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ezra grinned. “I try.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>A part of Hubert was still making plans to poison Ezra even days after his encounter with the aggravating mercenary. It helped calm his nerves in the midst of his continued investigations into the Eisner family. After his…less than stellar efforts to investigate the professor were stymied at such an important moment, he decided to broaden his focus to see what else he could discover of the mysterious mercenary family.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Beginning with Jeralt, Hubert quickly found that the Blade Breaker, arguably the strongest mercenary in modern Fodlan, was…honestly something of a boring old man. He kept to his work as the knight’s captain most days, went fishing on his off days, and got drunk after work. Not especially impressive and not really where his investigative efforts should be focused anyway, so he decided to leave the knight captain for another time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The fact that Jeralt often drank with his mercenaries in his off hours had little to do with his decision. Really, the fact that he spent so much time around Alois and the man’s terrible jokes had more to do with it…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for the younger sister, Shez Eisner was, paradoxically for someone he suspected of being a member of Those Who Slither in the Dark, a remarkably carefree person. She spent her days training when she could and spending time with her classmates otherwise. She was with the other members of the Blue Lions house most often, which made it somewhat difficult to keep an eye on her, though she also had friends in the other Houses. She spent a not-insignificant amount of time with Dorothea, though she had some difficulty understanding the topic of opera, and Caspar was a frequent sparring partner for her. As was Felix, but he was a Lion so that was less significant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Most importantly, of course, was the time she spent with “Emily”, which was more than the infiltrator spent with anyone else. Keeping an eye on Kronya would be a difficult proposition, given she was, from what Hubert knew of her, quite likely to jump to attempted murder were he to be discovered, but it was important to note the time the two interacted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He also saw Shez go on what seemed to be a date with the prince’s retainer, Dedue, so that was of interest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lastly, he went back to watching Byleth, though at this point he decided to just make it obvious that he was doing so. She clearly had decent enough situational awareness to discover him even when he was making an effort to avoid discovery, so he chose to just derive some enjoyment from very obviously taking notes of her behavior and watching the other students get unnerved by his presence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Strangely though, he did notice Thunder Catherine also appeared to be spying on her. Which was certainly curious. Perhaps the church didn’t have as much trust in her as the archbishop pretended?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regardless, he had little luck discovering anything truly useful to her highness, especially given a mixture of his other duties and class time kept taking his attention away from his investigation. He didn’t completely forget about his intentions to discover the truth behind the Eisner family, but he had other matters to focus on, such as her highness’s upcoming birthday.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A part of him felt a tad annoyed when he arrived outside her room only to find a bouquet of roses already waiting for her. Somehow, despite not being there, Monica had managed to best him in being the first to give a gift to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert delivered his gift for her highness, a book on monarch studies, early in the morning, then accompanied her as she went about her day. Her thanks and praise for the gift kept him in relatively high spirits, enough so that he didn’t show too much annoyance at Ferdinand’s attempt to one up him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Here you are, Edelgard!” the fool declared as he held out his gift to her, presenting her highness with a pair of admittedly fine riding boots. “Of course, I do not expect you to put them on right away, but I am sure you will see some use for them soon enough!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, thank you, Ferdinand,” Edelgard said, more bemused than happy, though she did grant the fool a smile. “I’m sure they will be very useful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are very welcome! Oh, and I did bring something else too,” he said, before handing her highness a bag of tea that Hubert was already making a mental note to test for poison. He didn’t really think the idiot would do something like that, but the possibility of him being used as a foolish patsy was higher than zero. “I recall you prefer the Hresvelg blend. I do hope it aids you in times of stress.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Thank you, Ferdinand. That is very thoughtful.” Her smile was more genuine that time, much to Ferdinand’s pleasure and Hubert’s annoyance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>More gifts were to come as the day progressed, ranging from Linhardt’s somewhat thoughtless gift of a book of crest designs to Bernadetta’s shyly presented bag of cookies, which were accepted with appropriate gratitude from her highness. Petra, meanwhile, gave her highness a finely crafted hunting dagger, in its sheath so it wouldn’t be construed as a threat, and a box of spices from Brigid, both of which were nice gestures that Hubert still planned to check later, while Caspar’s present was a steel axe with a ribbon tied around it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blunt, but appropriate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya didn’t even bother to try, and Hubert was grateful she didn’t. It meant less work for him later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Finally, Dorothea arrived for her outing with her highness, and Hubert pretended to see them off before following after the pair, because obviously he would. He knew enough about Dorothea to be aware she would not hurt her highness, but that didn’t mean he believed no harm could possibly come to her while she was out in town. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regardless, the outing went well, and her highness seemed quite happy as she returned to the monastery, chatting with Dorothea about classes and other topics of interest. Hubert listened along, making mental notes of anything that sounded important, and made his way towards her highness, planning to rejoin Lady Edelgard as she made her way into the academy. And if he happened to startle Dorothea with his sudden appearance, well, he couldn’t be blamed for her lack of spatial awareness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though his plans were thwarted before he could enact them due to a surprise appearance by Professor Eisner, who was standing near the pathway up towards the monastery. She had her hands behind her back and was clearly waiting for Lady Edelgard, judging by how quickly her attention turned towards her highness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert was aware that Professor Eisner had more reason to want Lady Edelgard alive than dead, or at least appeared to, but he still felt some tension as he hurried towards the group. Thankfully, his concerns were unfounded as the professor presented her gift to her highness: a stuffed bear colored in Imperial Crimson, decorated with a royal purple ribbon around its neck and “holding” a carnation in its paws.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Here you go. I hope you like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Lady Edelgard stared at the plush bear for a moment, before she slowly reached out and took it. “...It’s a rather childish gift…but it would be rude of me to ask you to return it, so thank you, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome. I’m glad you like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lady Edelgard ducked her head, avoiding the professor’s gaze, and Hubert felt his eyebrow raise when he saw a hint of pink at her highness’s cheeks. Something Dorothea also noticed, judging by her teasing smile, before she also noticed him and jerked back. “H-Hubie! Don’t do that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lady Edelgard didn’t flinch at Dorothea’s loud exclamation, though she did give Hubert an unimpressed look, which he returned with a smile in turn. “Hello, your highness. I hope you had a pleasant day out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes, I did. Thank you for your concern, though I would ask that you stop trying to scare our classmates,” she reprimanded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll try, your highness,” he lied without shame, before regarding the professor again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He did have to admit, she had good instincts.</span>

  <p>
  <span>When it came to whatever mission they were assigned to that month, the students were expected to start marching based on how long it would take to arrive at their location. As such, for this particular mission, they had to rise rather early so they could follow behind the Knights of Seiros as their rearguard to Magdred Way, something many of them weren’t really keen on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please tell me we're taking a break soon, I don't have the energy for this…" Linhardt muttered as he let out a yawn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't see how you can be sleepy in this weather, Lin. Even with this coat, the cold’s really bad," Caspar responded as he shivered a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hah, if you think this is bad, then you definitely don't want to come up here during the winters. If you aren't careful, you might end up buried under the snow," Sylvain teased as he and the rest of the Blue Lions seemed to be handling the cold better, minus Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Could have gotten better coats at least…" Shez muttered, shivering too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My apologies, these were the only ones the church could lend us. Apparently the vanguard had already taken several," Dimitri apologized. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You at least had the foresight to ask them for coats, so we are thankful for that," Edelgard complimented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good job Dimitri,” Byleth added, seemingly unphased by the cold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, excuse me professor, I thought you weren't used to the cold?" Annette asked, surprise evident in her voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not. I’m just channeling fire magic," Byleth responded, "It's keeping me warm." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait really?" Shez asked, before approaching her sister and pressing right up against her side, "Woah, you’re really warm, what the hell! Why didn't you tell me you could do this!?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You didn't ask," Byleth said, a bit annoyed as Shez clung onto her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...hm." Thinking to herself for a moment, Edelgard began to channel some magic as well and felt some warmth flow through her body. It seemed learning magic could have its uses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, professor, perhaps you could share that technique with the rest of us?” Ferdinand requested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth tilted her head, thinking. “It’s too late to do that easily at this point, but I could teach the basics of black magic for our next class. It might be good for you all to know at least one spell, even if you prefer other fields of study.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, that sounds like a pain,” Caspar complained, “I’m no good at that reason stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s remarkable how comfortable you are with admitting that,” Linhardt murmured, earning a little chuckle from Hubert.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do all of you need to be talking so much?” Ingrid complained from her place in the procession, “You’re going to give us away if we run into any enemies.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“E-Enemies?!” Bernadetta squeaked, “W-Wait, I-I thought we were supposed to be the rearguard! Why would we run into any enemies?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You never know,” Felix commented, “It would be smart of Lonato to put out scouts.” He didn’t seem to notice Ashe had stiffened at Lonato’s name as he continued. “Maybe we might actually see some combat?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, it seems too foggy for anyone to actually spot us out here,” Sylvain said, glancing up at the completely overcast sky, “It’s not really good weather for scouting, especially with the knights out in force to cut down any scouts they might catch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, noticed Ashe’s reaction and pulled away from her sister, even if she’d rather stay close to the source of warmth. “Hey Ashe, how are you doing?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, I'm doing okay, just… more nervous than I'd thought I'd be." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I can see why… but well, we're all here, so you can rely on all of us… well, maybe aside from Petra," Shez muttered, looking over at the Brigid girl who looked ready to keel over in the cold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why are these l-lands so cold…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eesh, guess we really are lucky you guys aren't here when it's snowing," Sylvain commented. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-What is this s-snow you speak of?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, well, it's kinda like frozen rain? Though I guess that's more hail…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"F-Frozen r-rain?! That is sounding dangerous!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's not that bad," Byleth said as she overheard them talking, "Though it can block the door if it piles too high. Made Shez freak out once." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, I didn't freak out!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You threw yourself out the window cause you thought we were trapped." A small frown appeared on her face. "You didn't even bother opening the window first." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A loud bark of laughter from Emily told Shez she was going to get teased heavily about that when they went back. More concerning though was the fact that Shez could clearly see most of Blue Lions nodding along like what she did was a perfectly normal thing to do. The only one that wasn’t was Mercedes and she looked equally concerned by her friends’ standards of normalcy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, I’m glad to see you’re all keeping your spirits high back here,” Catherine called out as she caught up with their procession. Well, not exactly “caught up” since she was coming from the front. "That's good, a very important thing to have when marching." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you Lady Catherine. We're honored to be able to fight alongside a Holy Knight like you," Dimitri said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need for the flattery, if you wanna show your gratitude just make sure to do a good job." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"With the wielder of the Thunderbrand on our side, I wonder how much we will be able to do," Edelgard commented. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Quite, one must wonder why he would incite a rebellion given the forces the church has," Hubert mused, getting Byleth to glance over at Catherine with a small frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Whatever his reasons, we have a mission to accomplish. Just make sure-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Report!” called out a church soldier as he ran up to them, “Lonato's forces are much larger than expected, they were able to slip past the vanguard using the fog for cover!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? What forces could he even have?" Catherine asked, shock evident on her face, before Byleth abruptly moved, grabbing Ingrid by her shoulder and pulling her backwards. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey, what's the big-" A sharp whistling noise cut her off as an arrow flew past right where she was standing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“DOWN!” Catherine immediately shouted, prompting the students to duck in case of any further archer fire, “Shields up if you have them!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned, trying to peer through the mist. With how low the visibility was, it was unlikely that whatever archers were out there had a clear enough view to actually hit any of them properly; the first arrow was probably just aimed towards whatever sound the archer picked up in hopes of hitting the enemy, which wasn’t something a master archer would actually do. Even a standardly trained one would probably hold until their commander gave the word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t have enough information to make any big guesses, but her instincts told her she was either dealing with someone masterful enough to spot and aim at an individual target in the middle of heavy fog, or a complete amateur who just aimed at the loudest sound they heard. And, at the moment, the latter might actually be more dangerous to her students.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We shouldn’t bunch up,” she stated, directing her words towards Catherine, “If we’re all together, any archers the enemy has have a greater chance of hitting someone so long as they aim in our direction.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True, but we don’t want anyone getting lost in the fog either, right? Besides, Lonato shouldn’t have enough soldiers to surround us properly,” the knight replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…He’s a minor lord. He shouldn’t have that large a force to begin with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly, so let’s be cautious here. We take down anyone that we see come through the fog.” Catherine glanced back at the pair of swordsmen she brought with her. “You two, with me. We’ll head in while this bunch stays back. I’m gonna assume you can keep the students safe, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded. “I will. Try not to die.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Catherine smirked. “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure to last so you can get a rematch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she headed forward, moving carefully into the mist with her back-up, Ingrid glanced back at Byleth. “Ah…th-thanks for that. Though…shouldn’t Professor Hanneman be the one leading us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He rode ahead earlier to speak with the knights forming the vanguard,” Byleth answered. “You’re stuck with me. Sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Honestly, I would think anyone would prefer having the professional mercenary at their side instead of a crest scholar in a situation like this,” Edelgard pointed out, her shield still raised as her eyes scanned the thick fog, “No disrespect meant to Professor Hanneman, of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re not incorrect,” Dimitri agreed, keeping his own watch as the students felt the tension in the air starting to grow. It wasn’t helped by the obvious scent of freshly spilled blood on the wind. “...We can’t hold this position forever though. We should have more than enough people to handle any threats out there, and we can’t take the chance that the enemy could get past us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-Are y-you sure w-we can’t just stay here?” Bernadetta asked, “S-Staying on defense sounds good to me! Defense always won more back in class!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…Light the torches in our supplies,” Byleth ordered, “There’s a forest to the north. We’re going to avoid going there in favor of sticking to the fields. There’s already too little visibility to risk it, but there’s a high chance of enemy soldiers hiding there specifically because of that low visibility, so I want a portion of you on our northern flank to keep us defended. Catherine was headed to the southwest, so we’ll focus our efforts westward. Anyone with shields, comes to the front with me. Lancers can form our back row, sword fighters cover our flanks, archers and casters at the back. Also, Bernadetta, fire an arrow in that direction.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Huh? M-Me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup. Here, right about…” Byleth raised her hand, before pointing at a specific spot in the thick fog. “There. Shoot an arrow right there.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nobody could really tell what she was pointing at, which only made Bernie’s nervousness worse, but she still pulled back the string of her bow anyway. “P-Please don’t hit anybody on our side…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let the arrow loose, and a second later the students heard a scream of pain, prompting a nod from Byleth. “There, that should draw them out.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Shez was pretty sure she’d never take another job in Faerghus again if she could help it. The cold was bad, the fog was worse, and while she fully understood why Byleth was taking things slow and steady to make sure all the students stayed safe, dear Goddess was she getting exhausted by how slow everything felt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which was probably more evidence of her skewed sense of how battles should work than a real indictment of how speedy things were going considering she’d already cut down three people. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jeez, this is dull,” muttered Emily, so Shez at least knew she wasn’t the only one thinking it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How can you say that?” Ashe asked, frowning at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because it is! I’m itching to run into the fray here!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretty sure that would get you blindsided,” Shez pointed out, “I can agree that things are going slow, but By’s right about it being safer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want ‘safe’, I want to gut someone!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Are you always like this?” Ashe asked, looking unnerved. Which was fair, considering how Em tended to be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The girl’s a psychopath, of course everyone is disturbed by her,” Arval pointed out, completely unnecessarily because Shez was already aware of that. It just didn’t bug her that much. “Oh don’t make that face at me, you’re the one who decided to be friends with her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That wasn’t what Shez was trying to convey with her face, but whatever. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see we’re feeling quite chatty on this end.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey Hubert,” Shez greeted, familiar enough with the tall boy’s weird cadence that she didn’t need to glance back to know it was him, “What’s up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just curious how things are looking on this flank. It’s quite difficult to spot things in this fog so I’m almost feeling left out. I’m sure you can sympathize, Ashe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, uh…I guess? I don’t really…yeah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Quite. One might even say this fog appears unnatural,” Hubert commented, looking directly at Emily. Who didn’t catch the hint at all and wasn’t paying attention to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ashe, meanwhile, looked thoughtful. “Hey, yeah, that is true. It’s strange that the fog is so thick this time of year. It should be lightening up, at least more than this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You see my point then. It does seem very unnatural. Perhaps as though it was being caused by something,” Hubert continued, glancing at Shez now. “...Perhaps some form of magic?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Is there magic that can do that?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes. There is. A rare type of magic. Some type of fell art, for instance. That certain groups may have knowledge of.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Like who?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh, shit, is that what this is?” Emily asked after a second, and Hubert found himself reevaluating his impressions on the intelligence of the two girls because that was far too genuine of a question to be an attempt at deception. “Alright, guess that makes this easier!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she promptly broke rank and sprinted off into the mist, prompting Shez to stiffen in surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“EM! Don’t just run off like that!” she called out before running off after her in the exact same way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, wait! Shez! Emily!” And Ashe hurried after the pair too, leaving Hubert with a half-amused, half-bemused look on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well, this should have an interesting outcome.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>By the time Shez found Emily again, the fog was actually starting to fade. And the reason for that became clear soon enough as she discovered her friend pinning a dark mage to the ground and messily stabbing him in the chest over and over again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hey, Em, I think you got him,” Shez said, before noticing Ashe caught up to them. “Oh, hey Ashe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What in the world is wrong with you?!” Ashe asked, which felt kind of rude before Shez noticed he was staring right at Emily. Which was more fair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh what, a girl can’t relieve some tension~?” Emily teased, before pulling her dagger free and wiping it on the dead mage’s robes, “Not that this wretch was all that fun to go after. These magic types just don’t know what to do when you get too close to them~.” She smirked over at Ashe. “It’s the same for archers, in my experience~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, we get it, you’re very scary, Em,” Shez replied, before looking around the field as her friend frowned at having her fun ruined, “Hm…do you see anybody that looks important?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lonato.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, exactly, like Lonato–...” Shez glanced back at Ashe, then followed his line of sight towards the ruins at the end of the path. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There, striding out from the pillars of some long ruined building, was the familiar sight of Lord Lonato of House Gaspard, his white hair hanging loose around his head as he regarded the three students from atop an armored warhorse. “...I see the Central Church was not satisfied with taking one son from me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? This is the beast we’re here to put down then?” Emily asked, regarding the old man with a faint interest before Ashe pushed past her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lonato! Why are you doing this!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Lord of Gaspard regarded his adoptive son for a moment, before looking towards Shez. “I remember you. Jeralt the Blade Breaker’s daughter. The younger one. Does your father work for the Knights of Seiros now, girl?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I think you should answer Ashe, sir,” Shez replied, inclining her head towards her friend, who was staring at his adoptive father with a look of genuine betrayal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would think my reasons were obvious. The Central Church is corrupt to its core! Rhea is an infidel who has deceived the people and desecrated the Goddess! The only righteous answer for her crimes in the death she has so readily delivered unto any who dare speak out against her heresy!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you talking about!? Lonato…what could justify doing this!?” Ashe questioned, “I saw the people out in the mist! They weren’t soldiers, they were townsfolk! Villagers that should have been under your protection!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Those who follow me are righteous crusaders who seek a better world than the cruelty we are trapped in by that vile witch! They are all bolstered by the blessings of the Goddess Herself! It does not matter what their origin is, only that they seek to fight for the truth!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you sent untrained ‘civilians’ to die against fully armed and armored knights?” Emily noted, sounding amused, “You really are quite the vicious beast! I’m almost impressed!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you shut up!?” Ashe demanded, glaring at Emily, “Lonato isn’t a beast! He’s a kind man! A good man!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lonato’s gaze softened at Ashe’s defense of him, before he urged his horse forward. Shez’s eyes couldn’t help but go to the spear in his hand as the treacherous lord spoke. “You know the truth, Ashe. You know that Christophe was murdered by these heathens. Can’t you hear his soul screaming out for justice? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His gaze turned towards Shez again. “Your father agreed with me. He knew the truth of the matter, that the Central Church could not be trusted, that Rhea was a liar and a monster! I know he would have joined me were he able! Will you not do the same!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, sorry, but whatever you have going on here has nothing to do with me,” Shez replied, “I don’t like Rhea, but I’m here to do a job. Or an assignment, I guess, since I’m a student.” She lifted one of her swords, pointing it at the Lord of Gaspard. “So either surrender or don’t. I’d prefer it if you do give up though, for Ashe’s sake.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Just an ignorant child then, unwilling to accept reality. Fine then. I will end you before life’s cruelties have a chance to ruin that naive innocence.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lonato, no!” Ashe yelled, “Please! I don’t want you to die!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I shall not, my foolish son. For I have virtue and the goddess herself on my side!” Lonato declared, before his horse broke into a full gallop, charging straight at the three students.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A smirk crossed Emily’s face, amused by the fool’s mad last stand, before it dropped when Ashe suddenly tackled her, pushing her out of the way of Lord Lonato’s charge. Shez, meanwhile, simply waited until the lord was close enough, his spear thrusting straight for her face, before she vanished in a violet flash that brought her right up on his horse’s back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lonato jerked back, genuine surprise in his eyes as he attempted to bring up his shield, but Shez was nothing if not fast, and her foot slammed into his chest, knocking him straight out of the saddle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Lord of Gaspard crashed to the ground with a heavy thud, followed by Shez as she landed far more easily on her feet. She moved towards the lord, her swords in hand, before she jerked back, bringing them up to deflect a sudden spear thrust from the old man, who made it to his feet far faster than she would have expected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should have gone for the kill, girl,” Lonato growled, before stabbing straight at the young mercenary as she found herself getting pushed back by his ferocity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lonato, stop, please!” Ashe yelled, getting up from the ground and running at his adoptive father, completely forgetting his own weapon as he tried to just get his father to stop, right before Lonato whirled around and slammed the shaft of his spear against the boy’s head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was no pause from the old man, no moment of hesitation at what he had just done, he just moved straight back into trying to stab through Shez as though nothing had happened, completely uncaring for the son he’d left collapsed on the ground with a massive wound across his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez felt her eyes widen at the sight, before a scowl came to her face and she vanished again, appearing behind Lonato and stabbing at his back only for his shield to catch her blades. There was a dark look in the old man’s eyes as he shoved her back, cold and furious. “Don’t think that trick will work twice on me, you vile witch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He suddenly raised his shield, blocking a thrown knife before he directed a scowl towards Emily, who looked genuinely furious as well, though for what reason, he couldn’t care less. “Wait your turn. I’ll kill you next.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you won’t,” came a strong, authoritative voice as Thunder Catherine strode onto the field.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thunderstrike Cassandra…Come to taunt me with my son’s murder again?” Lonato asked, his eyes locked on the object of his hatred.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t answer to that name, Lonato. And I don’t have anything else to say to you.” Thunderbrand crackled in her hand, crimson energy flickering about its blade, stained with a mix of blood and steel after Catherine had cleaved through the armored knights of Lonato’s guard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine. I don’t want to hear any justifications for your vile zealotry anyway.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kids, get Ashe out of here,” Catherine ordered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t tell me what to–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But I can win this!” Shez shouted, interrupting Emily, “I know I can–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s not going to go down without you killing him, kid,” Catherine stated, “And I don’t think you want to do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez hesitated, a conflicted look crossing her face, which Lonato decided to take full advantage of, suddenly stabbing towards her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Watch out!" Arval shouted out to her, too late as the blade was about to pierce her, before a ball of flame caught him in the chest and sent him skidding back as Byleth Eisner stepped forward with a look of genuine rage on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don’t you dare hurt my sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With a flick of her hand, a healing light glowed around Ashe’s unconscious body, mending the wound in his head and stirring the boy awake as he blinked. “H-Huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“By!” Shez exclaimed, surprised and happy to see her sister, which did bring some of her anger down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi Shez. Sorry, but I really want to kill this one. Could you handle the stragglers?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “Oh, uh…are you sure? I mean–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He k–...He was going to kill you, Shez. I’m going to kill him.” She glanced back at Ashe. “Sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...P-Professor, please, can’t you try–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He made his choice.” Byleth turned away from them, and nodded to Catherine. “With me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Sure thing, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lonato scowled, glaring at the two women. “You blind fools! Are you truly so enraptured by–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then a second fireball nearly took his head off, and would have if he hadn’t raised his shield in time. Not that it helped him much as Byleth and Catherine charged in with a flurry of blows, both their blades wreathed in lightning as they struck at the old lord. No more words were exchanged; none could be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All that was left was the quick and methodical removal of every defense Lonato had as his spear was first struck from his grasp, then his shield was completely rent to scrap, and finally the pair of blades cut straight through his breastplate and his chest underneath, ripping through him in a bloodied X across his torso. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blood spat from his lips as Lonato stumbled backwards, his eyes still clouded by hate. “G-Gahh…th-that…vile woman…sh-she took…everything…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before he finally fell back with a crash, left with nothing but one last look at the foggy sky. “Christophe…f-forgive me…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you back then,” Byleth muttered, staring down at the body of the once kind lord.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Catherine sighed. “I never thought things would turn out like this. I never wanted it to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You made your choices. You can’t take them back now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know.” Catherine clapped a hand to Byleth’s shoulder. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She nodded, gave Byleth’s shoulder another pat, then turned to walk off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stared at the body for a few more seconds, then turned away too, going to check on her students and leaving Lonato’s body laying in the grassy field. Even in death, it was impossible to miss the regret on his face.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>"Is everyone okay?" Edelgard asked once the battle had come to an end. Lonato was dead and his remaining forces were, well…also dead. Untrained civilians didn’t have much of a chance when facing off against trained combatants.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, no major injuries, Lady Edelgard," Ferdinand responded. "We've already healed up the minor ones as well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"C-Can we go home now?" Bernadetta asked, trembling as she gripped her bow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Once the knights finish their sweep we will," Edelgard responded as she scanned her class. Despite Ferdinand's claim, it was clear he was merely putting on a brave face, especially given how shaken most of their class seemed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe we should sit down for now?" Dorothea asked, trying to put a smile on. "If we're going to wait, no sense in just standing around, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That is true. In that case, everyone, make sure to rest and recover before we march back," Edelgard commanded, which seemed to be the right thing to do as a good deal of her class immediately collapsed onto the ground. "Hm, has anyone seen the professor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She went to find a river." Surprisingly, it was Emily who responded there, the student leaning against a tree. The disguised student scowled before pointing off in a direction. "That way." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…Hubert, make sure to keep an eye on everyone. I shall return soon enough." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, your majesty.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, should I go with you, Lady Edelgard?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ferdinand, please stay here, I need to discuss something private with her," Edelgard responded, feeling thankful that he didn't press the topic as he moved to sit down. Walking off, Edelgard made sure to keep her guard up. While she was certain any remaining militia would surrender at sight of her, she still had to keep careful. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That aside, she couldn't help but wonder what her professor was doing. She understood that she had her history with Lonato and Catherine, so Edelgard wanted to make sure her professor was okay. Thankfully, the river she was trying to find was nearby and she easily spotted the mercenary-turned-professor crouching down near it as she splashed water upon herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There you are, professor," Edelgard called out, before frowning as Byleth didn't respond. "Professor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Walking up to her, Edelgard reached up to place a hand on her shoulder, making the mercenary flinch in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, Edelgard, I didn't notice you," Byleth responded, turning to look at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you okay, professor? It's not like you to let someone sneak up on you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was just focusing on cleaning myself off," Byleth responded in the same tone, before she stuck her hands back into the water. There was nary a trace of blood on them even as she wrung them in the water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Professor, I heard what happened with Lord Lonato. Do you want to speak about it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There's nothing to talk about, we completed our mission, and now we wait to head back," Byleth responded, "Did anyone get hurt?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...No, professor," Edelgard answered, "If I may ask, how close were you to Lord Lonato?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not especially. He was a client, if one I failed," Byleth answered. "Though…I can't help but wonder if I hadn't failed, would things have ended up like this?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose that is something we all have to wonder about our own failures," Edelgard said, looking down at the water herself. "Even now, I can't help but wonder what my decisions will cause." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right… being the emperor means you'll need to decide big things." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, it also means I cannot afford to hesitate or falter either. As the Emperor I may face issues with any reforms I establish, and may even likely have to end a rebellion like this one should they arise. Even if someone I care about is leading them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That sounds… tough." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Such is the price of being the one in charge. Even if I end up like Lonato and end up sending citizens to their deaths for a just cause, I must continue onward. Though I suppose that's easier to say now since I am just a student." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm." Byleth brought her hands out of the water. "I don't think I could ever do that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Truly? You seem skilled as a commander though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. And I want to keep everyone under my command alive. I don’t think I could sacrifice people. I just…” She sighed, before brushing her hands on her clothes. “I understand there will always be a risk of death in battle. But I’m not going to let anyone die for me if I can prevent it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…perhaps that’s the difference between a commander and a ruler…” Edelgard mused, before shaking her head when Byleth glanced at her, “Never mind. We should get back to everyone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We should," Byleth agreed as she stood up, "Hopefully the knights will finish their sweep soon." </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>As Edelgard went off to find Byleth, the Black Eagles couldn't calm down as they waited for the knights to finish their sweep. One student in particular couldn't help but let out a frustrated yell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Agh! What was the point of this!?" Caspar yelled out as he stomped his foot, "They didn't even need us, it was just a bunch of townsfolk!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Ferdinand clenched his jaw, frustration evident on his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"One can only wonder just what led Lord Lonato into doing this…" Hubert muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It doesn't matter what reason he had! He led a bunch of innocent people to their deaths!" Caspar shouted again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh why are you complaining? Townsfolk or not, the fact that they rebelled makes them 'outlaws' doesn't it?" Emily asked, a mocking grin on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Caspar stiffened, his gaze turning towards his classmate. “What the hell? What is wrong with you?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...How could you say that?" Dorothea asked, equally taken aback by Emily’s mockery. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How could </span>
  <em>
    <span>I </span>
  </em>
  <span>say that? I'm not the one who was arguing about the morality of killing 'subhumans' now was I?" she asked again, making Caspar flinch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How are you having the knowledge of that? You were not in the class," Petra questioned with a faint frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What, do you think I skip out on class all the time? Just because you don't notice me doesn't mean I'm not around," Emily said, pointedly staring at Hubert with that line, making him bristle in response. "Either way, don't act like you're better just because you only kill 'bad guys'. Who knows, maybe one day one of you might be a 'bad guy' we go up against? Because regardless of what side of that I'm on, I certainly won't hesitate." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ferdinand stood straighter with a deep frown on his face. “We are all part of the same class, Emily, and citizens of the Empire as well! There is nothing that would cause us to fight each other like that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pfffft–HA! Aw, you can’t believe that, Fer-</span>
  <em>
    <span>dee</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she mocked, smirking at the tall redhead, “Wasn’t it your dear old daddy who turned against the emperor, hm? You can’t tell me you forgot~. I’m sure Edel didn’t~. So I wonder how long it’s going to be before Adrestians start spilling Adrestian blood again~! Though who’s to say it’ll even be the good princess that decides to take her vengeance, hm? Maybe there’ll be a commoner uprising, or the big bad general in charge of the military decides he should be at the top of it all?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her smirk widened as she stepped closer, playful and cruel as Ferdinand grimaced, clearly unhappy. “Don’t think for a second that you’re safe because of lineage or authority or that special, noble blood of yours. The most powerful man in the Empire can get splattered by a rock on complete accident. Do you really think you won’t get dragged into the violence when Edel decides your daddy’s gotta go? Because you and me, we both know it’s coming. And when he goes, well…I see a whole lot of people here whose parents were part of that Insurrection that got all her siblings–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Korsch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily paused, then glanced over at Hubert with a mocking smile. “Oops. What, you don’t like being reminded that your own daddy betrayed the Imperial family?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am well aware of what my father has done,” he replied in a low, dangerous tone, “You’re not doing yourself any favors by dredging up the past.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooo, how scary~ Though speaking of favors, none of you are doing any favors to yourself by acting like you're on some moral high horse. Murder is murder, no matter who you kill," Emily said, a smirk on her face. Which faded away to annoyance as Byleth and Edelgard walked back to the group. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Byleth glanced around the group, seeing the obvious tension in the air. As well as several glares aimed at Emily. Aside from Bernadetta, who was hiding as far behind a tree as she could get. "...We should head back to the monastery." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor?" Looking at Byleth, Edelgard felt a bit surprised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There's not much else we can do here. I'll make sure to deal with any trouble in case the church gets angry we went back early," Byleth said, before nodding to the class. "All of you deserve to be able to rest in a bed, not on the ground in the cold." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I certainly won't argue with that," Lindhart muttered, finally speaking up as he stood up. "I'll go on ahead."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Silently Byleth watched the students begin to walk off, before she glanced at Edelgard. "Make sure none of them wander off, I'll catch up soon." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Try not to take too long, professor," Edelgard said, nodding as she walked towards the group. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Emily, a word." Byleth called out to the minor noble before she could walk off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? What do you want?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Huh? What's with the sudden question?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You were in the fight with Lord Lonato, right?" Byleth asked. "I didn't check earlier, but were you injured against him?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Feh, as if I would get hurt by an old man like him. Also, why are you still calling him 'Lord' Lonato? You were the one who killed him." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Byleth’s face tightened. "Yeah, I did. He was a good man, and I still had to kill him. Regardless of what I thought of him, he nearly killed Shez. You can say I was being selfish, but between the two, I would choose my sister every time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Heh, not so much of a goody two shoes are you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I never said I was," Byleth responded, "All I want to do is make sure the people I care about are safe." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hmph. Sure, whatever,” she muttered, walking away without another word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth watched her leave and let out a little sigh. She knew this mission was going to be messy no matter what happened, but she didn’t think it would be this bad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she still couldn’t get that image out of her head. The memory of a time that hadn’t happened, one where Lonato had readily stabbed her sister straight through the chest.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Shez wasn't sure what she should feel. She was glad none of her classmates got hurt, but that didn't mean it was all okay. She reached her hand up, about to reach over to Ashe as her friend cried over Lonato. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please don't beat yourself up, Ashe. We did what we had to do." Only to immediately bring her hand back as Dimitri spoke up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I… I know. I'm sorry." Ashe said, wiping away his tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…Hey Ashe, why don't you go check on your siblings?" Shez suggested, not really sure what else to say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Y-Yeah, I should… check on them and the town," Ashe said, trying to put on a brave face. "I-I'll return as quickly as possible." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nodding to the two, Ashe ran off, leaving Shez alone with Dimitri. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That… I've had to deal with rebellions before, but that was the first time I've had to fight civilians, those I've sworn to protect…" the prince murmured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I've uh, never had to do something like this either," Shez responded, unsure of what else to say to that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I would imagine so. Captain Jeralt does not seem like the type of man who would accept such work," Dimitri said, before he frowned. "How is your sister doing? I had heard that she was the one to…deal with Lonato." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Her and…Catherine." Shez really wasn't sure how to feel about that. She knew it was their mission to work with her but…Why would Byleth be willing to work with the knight who nearly killed her? And to take out Lonato? Gritting her teeth, Shez couldn't help but feel angry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had hoped that maybe they could have talked Lonato down. Maybe it didn't have to end with his death. But then…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There wasn’t anything you could do there,” Arval assured, “Your sister made that quite clear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez let out a breath and turned back to Dimitri. “So…You fought in a rebellion before?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…I did, yes. It was in the west, though…more north from here,” the prince explained, his gaze turning northward, “...Would you believe I cannot even remember the name of the lords that rebelled? They were minor in the grand scheme of things, seeking independence from the kingdom after my father’s death. They claimed their lands shouldn’t belong to Faerghus, for they were once their own independent nation…hm. It is…interesting to think that these ‘men of Mach’ wanted independence from Faerghus just as Faerghus wanted independence from Adrestia…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…neat? Why’s that important?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m just…thinking of the parallel. That was the battle where I…ah, never mind. We already have far too many tragedies marring this day to discuss my failings.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, alright, if you say so.” Shez shrugged, not really getting why Dimitri brought that stuff up if he didn’t want to talk about it. “Should we head back to everybody then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…yes, I suppose we should.” Weird, he seemed kind of disappointed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval sighed. “Partner, he clearly wants to talk about his ‘tragedy’ here, he is just being overly polite. Talk to him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh…hey Dimitri! Tell me about…that thing that happened!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri blinked. “Er…which thing are you referring to?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, the thing you said was a failure. What’s up with that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval sighed again. “You are a master of tact, partner.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…well, it…To make a long story short, I showed a side of myself that I didn’t intend to during the battle against the rebels, and Felix witnessed my…savage actions. He did not take it well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that’s why he’s such an asshole to you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri blinked, then pretended to cough. “I would not…he has his reasons.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well what are they? Because I’m pretty sure there’s some kind of rule where you can get in a lot of trouble for insulting royalty, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They are…I really shouldn’t speak of Felix’s behalf–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, then tell me what you’re thinking. You can’t speak for Felix, sure, but you can speak for yourself. Why do you think he’s mad all the time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...A few reasons, I imagine. His brother died for my sake, and while fighting alongside one another, he saw that I…enjoyed it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Enjoyed fighting? That’s not that weird. I mean it’s kind of hypocritical for him to get mad at that when he’s always picking fights.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Killing. He saw me enjoy killing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “Ohh…uh, hm. So that's it then…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sighed. “So now you know. And I can tell you are revising your opinion of me as well. I understand, I am a monster-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Hey, hey, look, I don’t think you’re a monster. I think it’s…weird that you like killing, that’s not really something I would hope to hear from a king and all–Hey, no getting sad! I can see your face getting sad!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, a-apologies, I just–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No! Shush! Just…okay! You’re not the first friend I’ve had that’s homicidal, and you’re nice! Seriously, you’re not even that aggressive, you’re like…I dunno, I guess animal-wise I’m supposed to call you a lion since that’s the Faerghus thing? But you’re more…friendly? I don’t know what lions are like, by the way, I’m just trying to say you’re not a bad person despite liking to murder people–No, hold on, that wasn’t how I meant to say that. I mean, it’s not like you stalk the streets looking for victims, right? You just get too into it when you’re fighting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...It…There is…more to it than that. I do not…enjoy that side of myself, but it does exist. And I understand why it would horrify those around me if ever I were to embrace it. No one should enjoy hurting others, much less killing them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but people do. I mean, look at Emily. She’s pretty much an outright sadist, but she’s still my friend. Stuff like that…it’s not all there is to someone. And from what she’s told me, she put those urges towards hunting, not murdering commoners, so that’s a good thing you could maybe try?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You are referring to the act of hunting, and not the part about murdering commoners, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–No, of course I mean the hunting part, not the–...” She frowned, scrutinizing the prince. “Was that a joke?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He tried not to smile. “I was just asking for clarification.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Feh. Alright, if you’re feeling good enough to poke fun at me, then you’re good enough to admit you have more good qualities than bad ones! So knock it off with the sad stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, of course.” Dimitri did his best to smile. “Don’t worry, I’m feeling better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Okay, good. Hm…hey, do you think we should follow Ashe and check out Gaspard? You know, make sure things are okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…while I do see the kind intentions behind that gesture, I do not think it would be the best idea to go there directly after killing so many of the town’s citizens.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Ah, yeah…yeah, that’s a good point.” And that brought down the mood again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez let out a sigh. Hopefully next month's mission will be easier. </span>

  <p>
  <span>Claude sighed. It was a long, drawn out sigh, one designed to attract attention from a certain purple-haired classmate of his. Not the pompous one or the easily frightened one, but the mercenary one, who was currently sitting at the same table as him in the mess hall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t notice, apparently too invested in the meat skewers she was trying, so he decided to sigh louder and longer, really putting in some weary, “woe is me” oomph into it. Still nothing. So he decided to try again and was promptly jabbed in the shoulder by Hilda.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you knock it off? She’s not going to notice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mmf? Notice what?” Shez asked, glancing across the table at the two of them. “Woah, hey Claude, when did you get here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Okay, point taken, no more being subtle with Shez,” he decided, before grinning over at his mercenary friend, “Hey Shez. I was just thinking that it’s a shame your class basically got to spend an entire month with the Eagles while us poor Deer were left out in the cold.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you can really say that considering how cold Faerghus was when we went up there,” Shez replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The metaphorical cold. The cold of loneliness, as we were left abandoned by our friends and classmates as they went on their own special mission.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t that special. We killed a civilian militia and Ashe’s dad, so it was actually pretty depressing.” He wouldn’t guess it from how casual her tone was. “Dimitri took it kind of hard. I think he thinks he should have done more? But he was more lively when I saw him earlier today so I guess he’s fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well he is going to be the king of Faerghus, so I guess that's to be expected. From what I've heard, the nobles of that house have had to put down some rebellions before, so they're probably used to it. Same can't be said for the Black Eagles though," Claude mentioned, glancing over at Ferdinand, who seemed quite restless as he tried to enjoy his tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yeah, even By and I haven't done something like that before, so it must be tough on them," Shez said as she let out a sigh. "Guess I'm just too used to the mercenary lifestyle to think about how stuff like this is affecting them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, but it's that same experience that helped make sure they all returned back, so I say that makes it even," Claude said with a wink. "Though I must say, the Lions and Eagles getting trained by two skilled mercs is quite enviable. Why, at this rate, the Golden Deer won't stand a chance at the Battle of Lion and Eagle." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, guess that means you'll have to find your own merc." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You wound me, my friend! You'll send me out alone in this cold dark world without any help? And here I thought a mercenary of your caliber had more honor than that." Claude sighed dramatically. "To think, first the older sister plans on stealing one of my own, and now the little sister can't even spare any kindness." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez quirked an eyebrow. "What's that about By stealing?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The professor is obviously planning on stealing Marianne away, of course." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, what?" Hilda asked, surprised at that revelation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Isn't it obvious? She and Marianne have been spending plenty of time together with the horses, and they even had tea together. Clearly she's planning on stealing the members of our house, starting with her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...uh, pretty sure that's just By being nice," Shez replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, like, it's nice Marianne has another friend, but I'm not sure how well she'd do in a different class,” Hilda said, “Heck, it sounds like Ferdinand and Linhardt are a bit too overbearing for her from what she said." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, seriously? I can get Ferdinand being too much, but half the time I see Linhardt he's practically falling asleep, and the other half of the time he's actually asleep." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm just going off what I heard. Granted, Marianne didn't tell me directly, it was more so her muttering." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…well, I'll check with By, just in case." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you're going to do that, why not also ask how my house can team up with hers, or yours if we can?" Claude asked, trying to get the topic back on track. "After all, it's only fair we get to have a little fun too, no?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why don't you ask her then? I don't even know what mission we'll have this week and until we have that info, there's no telling what it'll be like." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…true. I can't help but wonder if it'll be more exciting than having to deal with a rebellion." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not sure how it can be." </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Our mission this month is to assist the knights in defending the monastery against an assassination attempt on the archbishop,” Byleth bluntly stated to her class after she received the mission. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-What!?" Bernadetta squeaked, nearly falling out of her chair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's just one thing after another isn't it…" Lin muttered, slumped on his desk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"To be specific, the knights themselves will be defending the archbishop, while we, along with the other Houses, will be patrolling the monastery on the Rite of Rebirth to ensure nothing happens," Byleth explained, trying to ease the tension. "We've even been allowed to choose where to patrol." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"To further add on to what the professor said, we believe the assassination attempt may be an attempt to hide what the perpetrators might truly be after," Edelgard said, getting her classmates to look at her. "As such, we will need to find what places they might be likely to strike."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"C-Can I just patrol my room?" Bernadetta asked, getting Edelgard to sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm." Said sigh abruptly stopped as she saw her professor actually think about that. "The dormitories are where several nobles are residing, so they might try to steal any valuables there…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-Ah! I don’t want any thieves coming into my room!” Bernadetta yelped, looking even more worried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you’ll have to worry about that, Bernadetta,” Ferdinand said, “Excuse me for saying so, professor, but I don’t think it’s likely anyone would fake an assassination attempt on the archbishop just to steal some things from the students.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We have to consider all possibilities,” Byleth countered. "As such, we'll be working with the other classes to ensure we're evenly spread out. If you find anything worth reporting, then do make sure to inform Professor Manuela and Professor Hanneman." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well that's good. Who knows, maybe this month we won't have a tough mission," Dorothea muttered as she leaned back in her chair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, I dunno about you, but I'm fired up to fight some real bad guys!" Caspar shouted, not wanting to sit still. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As long as we are not fighting in the cold, I shall be ready," Petra said with a nod. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...If any of you need to, then take it easy for the investigation,” Byleth said, “There will be many eyes on watch, so not everyone needs to assist." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor?" Edelgard gave Byleth a surprised look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We trained a lot last month, it's important to recover so we don't strain ourselves," Byleth explained, though Edelgard felt that wasn't the full story as the professor moved to the chalkboard. "For now though, we have a lesson to start. A few of you were interested in my technique to keep warm while in cold regions, so we will be focusing on magic studies for today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, c’mon,” Caspar whined, already looking annoyed, “I’m never good with this reason stuff…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s just an opening lesson, Caspar. I’m sure by the end of it, everyone should be able to cast at least a basic spell, though we might have some difficulties actually teaching the warming technique to those who can’t cast fire spells.” Byleth tilted her head in thought as she started sketching some basic sigils and diagrams from her books on magic. “If it helps, I can show you how to set your weapons on fire with magic afterwards.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, really? Then alright, let’s do this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard did her best not to sigh or roll her eyes at her classmate’s enthusiasm. Instead, she paid attention to the professor’s lesson, which she did have to admit was fairly basic in terms of magical education. That didn’t make it useless though, especially as the professor took the time to make sure everyone could cast at least a basic version of an elemental spell, and there was some practice afterwards as everyone gave their new abilities a try.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately for Bernadetta and especially Petra, it turned out their own “natures” didn’t mesh well with fire at all. Bernadetta turned out to be better with ice and thunder magic, while Petra only managed to form a basic wind spell, much to her disappointment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Caspar, however, was the most vocally disappointed, as he discovered that it was actually very difficult to light a weapon on fire without causing the whole thing to fall apart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agh, how do you do this!?” he asked Byleth, looking frustrated at the charred axe in his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I think part of the problem is that you have to be doing calculations in your head the whole time,” Byleth explained, picking an axe up from the pile to help demonstrate, “The actual mathematics tend to vary. It’s not as simple as saying it’s arithmetic or calculus, it’s more about remembering a sequence of symbols and how they relate to each other. The sigils formed when magic is used does have specific meanings to it. I tend to think of it as ‘fire’ plus ‘control’ added on top of ‘blade’, where blade represents a changing variable. That variable has to be marked as ‘non-consumable’ because fire naturally wants to burn whatever it’s attached to, which is tricky to do. You can’t convince ‘fire’ to recognize the variable as ‘fire’ because then it reacts to it like it’s a competing flame…Sorry, am I making sense?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Caspar crossed his arms over his chest and nodded firmly. “Totally! I just don’t get it at all!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah. Hm…maybe I could ask the blacksmith if he can make you a magic axe?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh wow, would you?? That would be awesome!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, why not? I was just going to get you flowers for your birthday, but a magic axe sounds better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A magic axe sounds way better! Wait, you know it’s my birthday today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup. I like to keep track of these things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw man, you’re the best, professor!” At least he was happy by the end of the lesson. The same couldn’t be said for the pair of students who came up to Byleth after class though, while the professor was reading through some papers at her desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor? Do you think we could talk for a moment?” Dorothea asked, prompting Byleth to glance up at her and Bernadetta, who seemed as fidgety as usual.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, what do you need?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Dorothea took a breath. “I wanted to ask…Does it get any easier? The…” She sighed. “Killing people, like we did on the assignment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I’m the right person to ask that question to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea paused, before frowning in some concern. “...What do you mean, professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean it’s always been easy for me.” Byleth glanced at Bernadetta when she noticed her flinch, but decided not to mention it at the moment. “I don’t like killing, but I don’t feel anything when I kill. I don’t take pleasure in it. I just don’t hesitate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...R-Really? B-But you l-looked sad,” Bernadetta said, before stiffening, “A-Ah! I-I’m s-sorry, d-d-don’t be mad!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not mad at you, Bernadetta. I didn’t realize I looked sad. I told Petra before, but I have trouble with emotions. I just don’t care the same way other people do. It’s not a bad thing that you two care. You might want to ask someone else about this though. I don’t think I’ll be very helpful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Dorothea took another breath, though she smiled this time. “I guess I am just different from you then, professor. I...Well, I’m willing to accept that it’s what I need to do, even if I don’t like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded. “I hope you never do like it. Killing is unpleasant. Do what you need to, and make sure to survive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I will thank you for admitting you’re not good at this sort of thing though,” Dorothea said, her smile taking on a hint of humor, “It does help to know that it isn’t easy for you, just in a different way than it’s difficult for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth didn’t entirely get what she meant, but she nodded regardless. “I hope this helped. Bernadetta, did you want to ask me anything specific?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-H-Huh?! A-Ah, n-n-no! I-I’m f-f-fine!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? But I thought you wanted to–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I don’t! B-Bye!” And Bernadetta promptly ran in the other direction, which…well, Byleth had hoped they were moving past that point, but she supposed it would take some more time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh dear, there she goes…ah, see you, professor! Hopefully we can have a more lighthearted chat next time,” Dorothea said before she headed out too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth waited until the songstress had left before she glanced at the entrance to her classroom. “Did you want to talk too, Ferdinand?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a pause, then the heir to House Aegir entered the room with a slightly sheepish look. “Ah, I see you have some very strong observational skills, professor! And here I thought I was completely hidden in the doorway, haha!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You weren’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes, well, ah…so! How are you today, professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine. How are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good! Excellent, really, I actually recently acquired an exquisite tea set and…and I, ah…” Ferdinand trailed off, seeming to lose track of his thoughts. “...I, ah…I think…I understand what you meant before. When you were talking about bandits.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stared at her student, then nodded. “Do you want to take a seat?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no, I should stand for this…I think. I…It feels like a topic I should be standing for, isn’t it? I mean…It’s strange. I think…I still believe there is a difference between the average, ordinary commoner and a bandit. A fundamental difference! Because bandits choose to become thieves when other people, many in similar situations, do not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He paused. “O-Okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay. I disagree with you, but I acknowledge that’s the viewpoint you hold. I’m not here to argue with you, Ferdinand. I’m here to help, and you look like you need help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…Wait, professor, you don’t need to get up,” he protested as Byleth stood, but she still got up from her seat and went over to get a chair for him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She set it down in front of her desk, then took her seat again. “Please sit down.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Ferdinand sat. It felt…strange. Like he was a boy again, sitting in front of his father’s grand desk, a symbol of his position as the prime minister. Then he looked again and it was just his professor, sitting at her usual teaching desk. “...It felt different. Lonato’s rebellion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth just nodded, silent and patient.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…I don’t understand how he could have involved innocents in the way he did. A lord’s duty is to protect his people, but he…he used them! It doesn’t matter if they volunteered, he should have told them no! It isn’t their place to fight, it’s the duty of knights and soldiers! Not untrained commoners given the bare minimum of weapons and armor!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His fists clenched in his lap. “It is a noble’s duty to…to protect people! They shouldn’t drag the innocent into their own personal vendettas! He let so many of his people die, and for what!? He should have known his goal was impossible! Not just impossible, completely mad to even attempt! How could he throw his own people away like that?! He might as well have set their houses ablaze for all the good he did them!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They even called him a good lord! They said he didn’t deserve to suffer anymore! His people loved him and he treated them like </span>
  <em>
    <span>garbage!</span>
  </em>
  <span> How could he do that!?! All just for his own worthless greed!?! HE–...” Ferdinand took a shaky, furious breath. “...I apologize, professor. It was unbecoming of me to raise my voice like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay,” Byleth reassured, “It happens when people get angry. It’s not wrong to be angry at injustice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I just…how many orphans did he leave behind? He likely devastated his entire territory, and I know he had children he essentially abandoned. And for such a meaningless reason too…” He unclenched his fists and flexed his fingers, hoping to remove what little stiffness that was there. “...I don’t know how he could be so cruel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“People are willing to do horrible things for their families.” Byleth pretended not to notice the way Ferdinand flinched. She wasn’t exactly pleased to see further evidence for her theory that Ferdinand wasn’t just talking about Lonato. “In Lonato’s case, I think he cared more about the injustice of his son’s death than what would happen afterwards.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You knew him before, right, professor?” Ferdinand asked, “Did you…What did you feel, when you had to kill him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Sad, I think,” Byleth answered, “I was angry because he would have killed Shez, but I think I was sad too. Emotions are complicated.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ferdinand huffed in wry amusement. “I am well aware of that fact, professor. It’s…strange, how varied the heart can be. You can love someone, even idolize them, and yet still feel such…genuine horror towards them that you’ll just…” He sighed. “I am getting off topic. My apologies.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You can talk about what you want, I'll be here to listen." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you professor. I must admit being able to… express myself like this has certainly helped." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you ever want to do it again, feel free to ask. It's my job to help my students after all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll make sure to remember that Professor. Ah, but I have one more thing to bring up." At the inquisitive tilt of her head, he continued. "It was about this month's mission, I did have one suggestion, it may benefit us to keep an eye on stables. It may not be their true intention, but setting a fire there could cause a panic to occur as the horses run wild." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…that’s a good point. I’ll recommend a portion of the guard keep watch over the stables then. Thank you for the suggestion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A slight smile returned to Ferdinand’s face. “You’re very welcome, professor. Anything I can do to help!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are very helpful, Ferdinand. Don’t lose that enthusiasm, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His smile got even bigger and Byleth ruthlessly squashed the part of her that wondered if she just made a mistake. “Thank you for saying so, professor! Very well, I shall continue to strive to be the very best noble I can be! I will become Lady Edelgard’s closest confidant and prove my father wrong!” What? “Or my name isn’t Ferdinand von Aegir! Ahahaha!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ferdinand continued to laugh as he stood and turned on his heel, heading for the doorway full of noble pomp and grandeur. Before pausing halfway there and turning back towards Byleth. “Ah, actually, I did have one more question. Do you know how I am like a bee?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is a thing Dorothea said to me that’s been plaguing my mind–Actually, never mind! This is a puzzle she has given me to unravel, and I shall not ask for aid! Thank you again professor! May you have a lovely rest of your day!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Okay. Thank you.” Byleth watched Ferdinand leave, then sank back in her chair, frowning to herself. “...How is he like a bee…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She tilted her head back, staring up at the ceiling. “...Ferdibee von Hiver…”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Huh. You don’t see that everyday,” Jeralt murmured to himself as he noticed both of his daughters were at the dock overlooking the monastery’s pond. Seeing Byleth there wasn’t unusual, especially since she’d really taken to fishing at the pond in her downtime, but Shez rarely had the patience to sit still long enough for the hobby. “...Eh, might as well see what the occasion is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmmmm…” Shez stared into the water, almost glaring at the fish in there as she sat on the dock. The fish that were plentiful, but weren’t going near her hook at all. “Mrgh…I thought fish were supposed to like worms?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They do,” Byleth replied, sitting beside her sister and keeping her rod far steadier.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then why don’t they like my worm??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not sure. Maybe they’re just not biting today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez looked at her sister, then looked at the bucket beside her sister, which was currently overflowing with a number of herrings, loaches, trout, and even a pike. Then she looked at her own bucket, which currently had a goby and a live crayfish inside it. “...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth normally had a very easy time keeping her face neutral. She was having a surprisingly difficult time at the moment though.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey kids,” Jeralt greeted as he came over to his daughters, taking a seat beside Shez with a fishing rod of his own in hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey dad! What’s up?” Shez greeted while Byleth simply gave her father a nod of acknowledgement, too focused on fish for the moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I saw you two down here and decided I should take a break. Hope you don’t mind your old man joining you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope! The more the merrier! Well, so long as you don’t steal all my fish.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you’ll need to worry about that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? And why’s–Dad, come on, even I know you need to put a hook on the string,” she complained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The line,” Byleth corrected, which prompted her sister to try to poke her in the side. Byleth, however, simply deflected the attempt with a quick hand before returning to her fishing, prompting a chuckle from her father.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well if you want to help me out, I wouldn’t mind. You know these old hands aren’t as dextrous as they used to be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez huffed, then glanced at Byleth. “Hey By, why don’t you help dad? You’re the master fisherwoman here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Byleth agreed, pulling her hook in before setting the rod aside and getting up to help her father out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks kid,” Jeralt said as he pretended not to notice Shez swapping her and Byleth’s buckets.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s no trouble,” Byleth replied. She tied the hook to the line easily enough, then returned to her place on the dock and cast her line out again before taking a seat. After a second, she glanced at “her” bucket, then picked out the crayfish inside and set it on her shoulder where the small crustacean settled down surprisingly calmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez snorted at the sight and couldn’t stop herself from giggling, which definitely wasn’t helping her attempts at fishing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt grinned at the sight, then settled in. Despite Shez’s claims, the fish were definitely plentiful and it wasn’t long before he had a decently sized bullhead wriggling on his hook.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s just not fair,” Shez complained while Byleth made a faintly impressed noise at the sizable catfish. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What can I say? I guess experience triumphs over youthful vigor again,” Jeralt teased.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mrgh.” Shez went back to grumbling, glaring mulishly at the water, while Jeralt noticed a flicker of…something, cross Byleth’s face. She was still happy, at least from what he could tell, but there was something under it as her eyes lingered on Shez a little too long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So, hey, how have things been going for you two?” Jeralt decided to ask after he cast his line back out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, about the same I guess. Claude was being all annoying cause he felt left out after the mission we just had." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...He felt left out because he didn't help against the rebellion?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah I don't know what's up with him, but hey, we're technically working together this month," Shez said as she shrugged her shoulders. "Oh, speaking of, apparently the Lions are gonna be guarding the vault, in case they try to take any weapons there." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, that makes sense… hey, do you know where they might target?" Byleth asked as she began to reel something in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Kid, there's so many valuable things here, even I don't know them all. Besides, as the acting knight captain, I'll be too focused on keeping Rhea guarded.” A thought occurred there that he decided to voice. “Meanwhile, you two should keep an eye out for your house leaders.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Why’s that?” Shez asked, looking surprised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just a thought I had. There’s a lot of important heirs here this year and they already had someone go after them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They did?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Iron King bandits, remember? Call it a hunch, but it seems too coincidental that they were in the right place at the right time to go after the prince, princess, and…whatever the Riegan’s kid title would be,” Jeralt explained, “Odds are, they were hired for the job and given details on where they were. And if we consider that, we should also consider that this new bunch might be after them too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I dunno, that sounds pretty far-fetched,” Shez replied, “Not everything’s connected, y’know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"True, it might be paranoia, but I might also be right. Either way, I'd make sure to tell those brats to keep an eye out for themselves." Jeralt paused, noticing that the fish managed to slip out of Byleth’s line as he said that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, By, something up?” Shez asked, “You're being quieter than usual." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Everything is okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yeah, Jeralt didn’t believe that for a second. "Come on kid, we won't be able to help if you don't tell us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...In the mission, I had to use that power," Byleth finally responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really? Is that how you saved Ingrid?" Shez asked, completely surprised. "Wow, that power of yours really is amazing."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Must be weighing on you though. Even if you managed to stop it, you still had to experience it," Jeralt sympathized, as Byleth began to shift in place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...That wasn't the only time I used it that day." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? Who else did you save?" Shez asked, before Byleth silently looked at her. "...Oh." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What happened?" Jeralt asked, feeling a faint sense of dread.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Lonato…he stabbed Shez. I wanted to talk to him, but…when I saw that, I didn't care." Byleth’s grip tightened on her fishing pole. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Her power is that strong?” Arval muttered, before huffing in the back of Shez’s mind. “Well, at least she is using it for a good cause. I suppose there’s at least a use for it if it can keep you safe, partner.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well, hey, Arval approves, in their own weird way,” Shez said, smiling over at her sister, “So it sounds to me like you did good!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Shez, you would have died,” Byleth stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, and that’s kind of uncomfortable to hear about, but you saved me! Everything worked out fine, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It did this time, but what about next time? What if I'm not there to save you when something happens?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...” Shez frowned. “I'm not weak By, I don't need you to save me all the time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I know!" Byleth shouted, catching the two off guard. "I know you're strong… but…" Almost imperceptibly, Byleth began to shake. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Kid, are you afraid of something happening to her?" Jeralt asked, mostly concerned but also kind of amazed. He never thought…Well, she was expressing herself more often…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? You’re actually…scared for me?” Shez, meanwhile, didn’t know what to say to that at all. “You…By, you know I can handle myself, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I saw you get stabbed through the chest, Shez–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but I would’ve been fine!” she insisted, interrupting her sister, “It’s not the first time–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re not invincible, Shez!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know I’m not, but I’m stronger than you think I am!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know how strong you are!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez felt a frown coming to her face as Arval made a noise of realization. “So she does think you’re weak. Weaker than her, at least. She did take your fight against Lonato. You were the one handling things there…And she did decide to kill him simply because she was angry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you stop?!” Shez snapped, before pausing when she saw Byleth blink, “Ah, not you–...No, you know what, you need to stop too! I’m not weaker than you and I don’t need to be protected!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth trembled, and Shez felt her own anger falter at the sight before her sister suddenly glared at her. “...Yes, you do. You’ve always been too reckless. Why did you go running off into the fog? Did you really want to fight Lonato that badly!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Hey, I went in because I was trying to keep Em safe!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So it’s fine when you do it then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! It is! Because I’m strong! And you were the one who killed him! I could have beat him and kept Ashe from losing his dad!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth outright scowled, something that sent a strange sense of alarm through Jeralt as he started to think he really should intercede here. “Alright, come on girls, you’re–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were losing,” Byleth bluntly stated, “He was an armored paladin with years of experience and a weapon with a much larger reach than you could have overcome. He would have kept you at bay until a hit connected or until he wore you down and then he would have killed you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stiffened, affronted, then scowled right back. “I still could have beat him! I could have cut his head off in my first move and the only reason I didn’t is because I didn’t want to! Because he was my friend’s dad and–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what would have happened afterward? The knights would have executed him. He was a dead man already, all you did was put yourself in danger–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez opened her mouth, about to interrupt, when she suddenly felt a hand on her head, startling her out of her anger. Across from her, Byleth was reacting much the same as Jeralt placed his hands on both his daughters’ heads. The pair stared at each other for a moment, before they both looked up at their dad, who was looking back at them with a faint expression of concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Alright. Let’s take this down a notch before anyone says something they’ll regret, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t need to be babied,” Shez complained, though she didn’t make any motion to brush her father off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know you don’t. Neither of you do. But a dad worries, you know?” He let out a sigh, before smiling down at the two of them. “I don’t think I’ve seen you two get that heated before. Usually when you argue, it’s Shez insisting on something while you just give one word responses, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...This was different,” Byleth grumbled, ducking her head to glare at the dock. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I noticed. You’ve gotten a lot more expressive over the years.” He glanced at Shez. “And you’ve gotten a lot stronger too. Still reckless though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I said–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know you went to rescue your friend. I’m not going to fault you for that. Just try to keep yourself safe, okay? You two are supposed to outlive me, not the other way around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...mmph. Don’t act like you’re going to keel over any day now,” Shez grumbled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t,” Byleth agreed, glancing up at her father again with a small look of concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, okay, no jokes about my mortality, I get it. But in exchange, I want you two to put this aside, if you can. It’s a shame what happened to Lonato. I can’t pretend I don’t understand where he’s coming from, but he made some very bad choices in how he decided to handle his grief. It’s rough, but we can’t change what happened.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Could we?” Shez asked, glancing at Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We cannot,” Sothis responded, her voice echoing in Byleth’s mind, “The point to change that man’s fate has long passed. You would be but a child again should you make the attempt, assuming such a thing would not simply destroy you completely and utterly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Sothis says it isn’t possible,” Byleth reported, prompting a scoff from Arval.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How convenient. Useful when she wishes to be, yet useless when you make a simple request.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez rolled her eyes, then tried to grin at her sister. “Arval’s being a pain.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rude! All I’m doing is being a good partner and staying by your side!” the not-ghost protested, “Why not ask her why it’s so impossible, hm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, fine.” So Shez asked, and Byleth replied back with what Sothis told her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, you’re not doing that,” Jeralt immediately said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. What a horrific power,” Arval muttered, and Shez…felt a part of herself kind of agree. The idea that it could alter things that much, or even kill Byleth just by using it…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Okay, so no changing history that much. Saving someone’s life, sure. Doing…that, no.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I can anyway,” Byleth replied, shrugging, “I’m pretty sure my changes are limited to the day they happen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. That is good to know,” Arval noted while Shez just sighed, scratching at her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, this is all starting to give me a headache…Hey, By, you wanna just spar a bit? Might help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth considered matters, then nodded. “Sure, that works.” Before remembering something important. “Oh, yeah, what should I do for this guy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pointed to the crayfish still resting on her shoulder, which didn’t seem to have been bothered by any of the arguing at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Is that thing even alive?” Shez asked, reaching over to poke at the crustacean and yelping when it pinched her finger instead. “Ow! Jerk!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seems alive to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I’m pretty sure people have bowls if they want to keep fish,” Jeralt suggested, “Speaking of, we should probably take your catches in if we don’t want them to rot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah! Great point, dad! After all, I’ve gotta show the fishkeeper just how much </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> caught!” Shez said, her grin returning full force as she picked up the bucket Byleth had filled with fish.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth stared as Shez started heading off, before lifting her fishing rod–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No trying to hook, trip, or hit your sister,” Jeralt reprimanded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth lowered the fishing rod, before deciding to just content herself with her new crayfish, which was clearly better than any of the fish Shez stole from her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She may have lost the battle, but Byleth won a friend, and that was what truly mattered.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>The monastery was a quiet place at night. In the dark, the ancient structure had a strange, somber quality to it. It was not empty of life, for there were still those who would wander even in the nighttime, but it was quiet, and silence had a way of making even the liveliest of locations feel melancholy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The town beneath Garreg Mach didn’t have that same presence, but it was still quieter than it would be in the daytime and it was far less guarded than the monastery itself. In other words, it was quite useful for those seeking to have clandestine meetings.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you think?” the first person there asked the second to arrive, staring up at the monastery in the distance. It was still in sight from their place at the town’s outskirts, appearing small, yet somehow looming over them all the same.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Garreg Mach is an impressive sight,” the second individual remarked, their voice distorted by the white mask they wore, resembling a human face marked by flames. It fit to their helmet, guarding their face from sight. “I despise what it stands for though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first person scoffed, resting her hand on her own mask. Hers resembled a bird, much like those worn by those called dark bishops, though it was deep crimson instead of a metallic black. Her robes were black and lined with golden markings, vestments of a faith she cared little for. “Your standards for ‘impressive’ are quite lacking. The world once had a thousand sights more majestic before it was stolen away by the abominations. But then, why should you care? You have little reason to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have reasons of my own to oppose the Nabateans. The history you speak of does not matter to me.” The Flame Emperor regarded her contact with open distrust. “You have a great deal of gall to summon me like this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yet you came when called, so it’s not really arrogant of me, now is it?” Bias waved a hand, dismissing her own words. “Forget it. I’m not interested in playing power games with a child. I get enough of that with Kronya.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. You are being indiscreet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who is here to listen? I took precautions, Flame Emperor. I will know if there are issues.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Very well. Then talk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias sighed, not quite slumping. “I swear, I wasn’t nearly this bad when I was young…I came here to talk you about your little 'assassination plot' you're trying to pull off."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I must say, it was a tad sloppy, but it worked. It's certainly impressive how much these knights will drop almost everything when it comes to their precious archbishop." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Get to the point." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Quite the impatient one aren't you? Very well. We have a shared interest, do we not? While we would certainly love it if you did eliminate the leader of the abominations, revealing the truth of Seiros's tomb certainly seems worthwhile." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And you want to be involved with my plans?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As I said, mutual interest. Really, it's like you're paying me back for not ousting you to the beasts." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>threaten me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I am simply stating the facts," Bias said with a small titter of laughter, "But if you wish for a sign of my goodwill, I could offer weapons and armor, perhaps to that 'death knight' of yours?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You know of my men," the Flame Emperor stated as they regarded Bias. They knew little about their “contact”, but what they did know was that she carried more authority than “Emily”, and that made her dangerous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course. Though you may not have kept contact, we have our own sources." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Flame Emperor regarded the infiltrator with annoyance. “It is your people who broke contact first. Am I to arrange my plans based on what I think you may desire?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"For now, no. What you can do, however, is lend us your knight."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You need the Death Knight’s aid? Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He is a powerful force that would be useful for our purposes. Should any of the abomination’s ilk take notice of our presence and attempt to intervene, he would be a boon in removing them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. And why would I aid you in this way? Regardless of the weaponry you offer, I see no reason to aid you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It does show a continued willingness on your part to aid our cause. We do share the common goal of removing the abominations from power, do we not? And you know well enough that my people can offer much to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Flame Emperor silently regarded Bias for a few moments, then scoffed. “The fact that you are negotiating with me rather than ordering it be done shows how much your position has weakened. Thales truly was the pillar supporting your enterprise, was he not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I won’t disagree with that. We have more than one pillar though. Even if he bore much of the weight, there is enough support that we may build more to keep things…stable.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is not how it works. A load-bearing pillar cannot be easily replaced, not without damage, and whatever other pillars you have, they cannot move into his place without disrupting their own. It’s how Aegir was able to push you out without Thales to keep him cowed.” She tilted her head. “You work best in obscurity, do you not? If there are those willing to support you, then you grow more bold, but you cannot touch Aegir because of how protected and public he is. He knows too much, but you cannot strike at him without risking discovery and death. And because he is in the way, you cannot get to me. Am I incorrect?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias shrugged. “You’re right on all counts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You look surprised. Or as much as you can be in that helmet of yours. Still, you’re correct. Thales wanted you as a pet instead of a mere beast, domesticated and willing to hunt down our prey, but Myson let you slip your leash. I’m not surprised to see you turn feral. Annoyed, but not surprised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The issue is that I’ve been sent to reestablish contact, to see if you’re willing to accept a new collar. Failing that, well…Solon has his ideas of how things should go. I have my own. All I will say is that loaning your knight will make things easier for us all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Solon. Tell me about him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias paused. “Is that a condition for gaining the use of your knight?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Death Knight is one of mine, but he is willful. I make no guarantees that he will be as helpful as you desire. But I will aid you if you are willing to share information. I know of Thales, and I recall the names Solon and Myson. So, tell me about them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah, of course, they were both involved in the Hegemon project,” Bias muttered, thinking, while the Flame Emperor’s armor hid any reaction she may have had. “...They are the Sages of Darkness and Thunder, leaders of our people, in a sense. Solon is one of our people’s greatest scientists, having fathomed greater depths of darkness than any other still living, and Myson is…Well, he’s decent enough, I guess. Overly focused on his own personal projects at times, to the point that he’s really allowed things to slip in Adrestia…but you’re aware of that part, of course. Otherwise, he is capable and competent, if better as an agent than a leader.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm. Who are the other sages?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I feel like you should be owing me for each of these questions I answer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Consider each one answered a mission you may use the Death Knight on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias made a faintly pleased noise there. “Useful…Very well. Among the sages, there are those greater and those lesser. Light and Dark hold the greatest power, and the lesser elements support them. As such, there is Chilon, the Sage of Earth, who followed Thales and acted as his guard. He was not there when Thales died, so you can imagine his current anguish. Thales himself was the Sage of Light, but that matters little now. Another deceased member of our order was the Sage of Wind, and another living member, Cleobulus, is Sage of Water. I myself am the Sage of Fire.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Your…’order’ has two sages at the monastery then. That seems dangerous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps. Solon has plans, and I am meant to guard him. We do not want another Sage of great importance to be lost to us. Or, worse, to fall into enemy hands.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I see. One final question then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That will be a third mission we are allowed to use the Death Knight on then, yes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Is Shez one of you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias blinked beneath her mask. “That girl again…She is Agarthan, yes. I do not know her purpose here though, and I would prefer not to speculate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I see. She is of ‘Agartha’ then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you want to repeat what I said, sure. And as I said, I don’t know why she’s here. Kronya seems interested in her, which doesn’t say much if anything good about ‘Shez’.” She shrugged. “Figure it out on your own if you’re so curious. She isn’t my problem.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would think one of your own people turning up in an unexpected place would be ‘your problem’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well it’s not. Unless she becomes directly relevant to me, I’m not interested.” Left unsaid was the interest that Solon had taken in the strange young Agarthan. Bias had no reason to tell the Flame Emperor everything, after all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine. You have three missions you may enlist the aid of the Death Knight for. Inform me of what they are beforehand or the deal is off.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Adding conditions after the fact? My, Thales really did train you well.” She smirked, because even with how much the Flame Emperor’s armor hid, there was no mistaking the flash of anger there. “I’ll make sure to report that you’re perfectly willing to work with us going forward.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Say what you want. But know that there is no ‘partnership’ between us. This was a transaction. Nothing more. Any arrangements made from this point onward will be temporary.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But she was willing to make such arrangements, and that was good enough for Bias. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, your majesty.” She bowed, the gesture filled with mockery, before straightening. “Have a good night now. Little girls shouldn’t be out after dark like this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard scowled beneath her helm as the monster in front of her vanished, but she let it be. Those Who Slither in the Dark did have their uses, even if she would dismantle them in time just as she would the Church.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which brought her back to the thought of Shez. Having it confirmed that the younger Eisner was indeed an ‘Agarthan’ did feel like something of a relief, in a strange way. She didn’t know the girl’s purpose here, but she knew her origins, and that could be worked on. Especially with the confirmation that she wasn’t part of the same faction as Bias and Solon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The fact that Those Who Slither even had factions was a fascinating revelation. The idea that they were not one whole, but a set of groups who may have their own motivations and desires, along with the confirmation that not one but two of their leaders were deceased…It opened up opportunities. Especially if the faction Shez belonged to happened to oppose Solon’s…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Flame Emperor turned and made her way back to where she would change from her disguise once more before returning to the monastery, her mind still awhirl with thoughts and considerations. Most significantly, the thought that she knew, specifically, who among the Agarthans had headed the project that mutilated her and killed her siblings.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard was not someone who focused on vengeance. It was a distraction and a danger; a detriment to creating a better Fodlan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even still, it was good to know who among her enemies could not be allowed to live.</span>

  <p>Shez huffed to herself as she walked around the monastery, no real destination in mind while she was lost in her thoughts. It had been a day since the incident at the dock, so she had been able to think some more, and while she was able to see where Byleth was coming from… </p><p> </p><p>"...I'm not a child," Shez muttered, idly kicking a rock that was in her path. </p><p> </p><p>"That sister of yours can be quite cruel," Arval commented, making Shez frown. "Honestly, she's probably just afraid to admit you're the stronger fighter." </p><p> </p><p>"Even if I am, we're supposed to be stronger together…" she muttered again, before deciding to look around to see where she was and realizing she wound up in the tea gardens. "Well, not the worst place to wander to." </p><p> </p><p>"That moronic Claude!" Blinking as she heard a rather angry sounding voice, Shez looked over to see Lysithea walking nearby, a scowl on her face. </p><p> </p><p>"Everything okay?" Shez asked, getting Lysithea to turn her glare towards her. </p><p> </p><p>"What do you want?" </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, just wanted to see if you were okay, you seem kinda pissed." At her words, Lysithea huffed. </p><p> </p><p>"Claude is being an idiot as usual. First he acts like it's his business when I go to sleep, and now he makes fun of me for my suggestion on where the perpetrators might strike!" </p><p> </p><p>"He did?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes! I suggested they might go for the library, and all he had to say was 'what, are they too busy to just check them out?'. Even if he didn't like what I said, he didn't have to mock me like I'm some child!" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, Claude tends to default to mocking," Shez agreed as she rubbed the back of her head. "I mean, I don't really hang out at the library, but there's some pretty important books in there, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes! There are many important magical tomes and historical documents! And it's not merely a matter of intruders stealing them, they might try to destroy them all!" </p><p> </p><p>"And let me guess, he didn't let you explain that?" </p><p> </p><p>"Before I could he was already dismissing Raphael's idea of them going for the food storages." With that said, she pouted. "Of course, he made no attempt to treat him like a child." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, that definitely sounds rough. I get what you're going through, By decided to start treating me like I need to be babied after the mission we just had.” </p><p> </p><p>“Really? You? Aren’t you a professional mercenary?”</p><p> </p><p>“A strong one at that! Hell, I've been doing this since I was younger than you.”</p><p> </p><p>“And yet you also treat me like a child.” </p><p> </p><p>“Ah… yeah, I can see why the things I said came off like that. Sorry about that.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hmph, just make sure not to do so again.” </p><p> </p><p>“Though I gotta say, even if you are young, you put in a lot of effort. You’re already way better than me with dark magic from what I've seen of you training.” </p><p> </p><p>“...You’re a dark mage?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? Did I not tell you? I know how to cast a few spells.” </p><p> </p><p>“Who taught you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No one really, just came to me naturally I guess. Maybe my birth parents were also dark mages, but I don't really remember anything about them.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Is that so?” Lysithea murmured, already assuming things about how Shez got these powers. </p><p> </p><p>“Yup. Hey, actually, since we’re talking about it, mind teaching me about magic? Might be nice having a mentor.”</p><p> </p><p>“...You want me as a mentor?” Lysithea asked, already sounding pleased at the idea.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, since we’re both being treated like kids, we might as well work together to show them!”</p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, well if I have time in between my studies, I suppose I could help you out. Though don’t think I'll go easy on you!" </p><p> </p><p>"I'd never dream of it!" Shez said with a grin. "Hey, if you're not busy right now, why don't we get something to eat before starting?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I was already planning on getting something to eat. So we might as well eat together if you're hungry." </p><p> </p><p>"Great! Let's go!" Grinning, Shez led the way.</p><p> </p><p>"Wh–Shez, you're heading to the dormitories!" </p><p> </p><p>Keeping her grin, Shez let Lysithea lead the way!</p><hr /><p>Byleth tried her best to keep her mind focused on other things while she made her way to the audience chambers to talk with Rhea. She still didn't particularly like the Archbishop, but she still had a job to do. And the best way to know what to protect was to ask the one being targeted. </p><p> </p><p>"Hello there, child. Have you been well?" Rhea asked when Byleth approached her, a gentle smile on her face. </p><p> </p><p>"...I am, yes," Byleth answered as she glanced around. "Is Seteth busy?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, he had some business to attend to." Rhea said. "That is to say, he is preparing things for his sister's birthday." </p><p> </p><p>"It's Flayn's birthday?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not yet, she was born on Saint Cethleann day. It is quite the blessing for young Flayn." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh, good to know." She’d have to get her something. Flayn wasn’t technically a student, but it would probably make the girl happy to get a present.</p><p> </p><p>"Quite, though I do hope you didn't come here just to learn about her birthday." </p><p> </p><p>"No, I wanted to ask about this month's mission." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh? Are you worried for me?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Jeralt will be in charge of your protection, you'll be safe," Byleth said, not wanting to admit that she wasn't worried. "What I wanted to ask is if there was anything in the monastery you would want protected?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh?" That seemed to actually surprise her. </p><p> </p><p>"There is a chance the perpetrators might have a secondary mission when they come. My class is having trouble deciding what to protect, so I wanted to know what you would want to protect." </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I see. Then you believe this assassinaton attempt may be a cover for another purpose?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged. “I said they might have a secondary mission. They might still be coming to kill you, but if most of the monastery’s security is focused on you, it leaves other areas vulnerable.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, I can understand your rationale…If I may offer a suggestion then, I would think the Holy Mausoleum would be a place of importance to protect.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. And…what’s that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea seemed faintly amused by the question, her smile twitching in apparent humor. “The Holy Mausoleum is the resting place of Saint Seiros. Her remains are interred there, and it would be a significant blasphemy were they to be disturbed.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” That sounded really stupid.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you wish to say something, child?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused. Something of her skepticism must have shown, which was…strange. She thought she was keeping her face as neutral as it usually was… “I don’t understand why they would want a corpse.”</p><p> </p><p>“The body of Saint Seiros is no mere corpse,” Rhea gently chided, “Her remains are held sacred by the faith, for she was the first to spread the word of the Goddess to the people of Fodlan.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, she killed Nemesis and founded the Empire.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea blinked. “Oh, I did not realize you already knew of that story.”</p><p> </p><p>“I heard it years ago. Nemesis was an evil tyrant, Seiros fought him with her saints, then she made the empire and the church afterwards.”</p><p> </p><p>“Heh. That is not incorrect, though it is a somewhat simplified version of the tale. Regardless, that is my suggestion. You may accept or ignore it as you choose.”</p><p> </p><p>“...You know you’re my employer, right? You could just order me to guard that place if you think it’s important.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea’s ever-present smile took on a sad quality that made Byleth vaguely uncomfortable. “I realize, yet I suppose I was hoping you could look past my position, child. It is rare that I am able to speak to anyone as simply Rhea, instead of as the archbishop.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I was here on business, I don’t think treating you as…Rhea is really appropriate.”</p><p> </p><p>She sighed. “That is true. My apologies. Perhaps I am being too familiar. You are Jeralt’s kin, so I feel as though we may have a connection. Though, perhaps I am being presumptuous.”</p><p> </p><p>It was strange how tense Byleth felt. She couldn’t help thinking back to that day, years ago, when she and Shez asked their father about the Knights of Seiros and he told them…everything.</p><p> </p><p>“...May I ask if Jeralt ever spoke of me?” Rhea inquired, and Byleth had the strangest feeling as she stared at the woman who helped deliver her as a baby. And who might have killed her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Fear was a new emotion to her. A strange, chilly sensation that hit when she thought of Shez or her father dying. This new emotion was different though. Like a creeping sensation along her back, a strange dread at being in this woman’s presence.</p><p> </p><p>“...He did.”</p><p> </p><p>“All good things, I hope?” Rhea said, and her smile was almost painfully hopeful, like she really did want Byleth’s father to have a good opinion of her. And it almost hurt to see it fade at Byleth’s lack of response. “...Perhaps not then. I suppose I cannot blame him. My position oft requires a certain sternness of word and action to maintain the sanctity of the faith. It can be frightening for some, though I do hope I have not given you cause to fear me, child.”</p><p> </p><p>She had. Maybe not directly, but everything Byleth knew made the woman in front of her feel like someone she couldn’t trust. Not for a second. But she wasn’t about to say that. “You haven’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am glad.” And she genuinely looked it. “May I ask, did he ever tell you of our first meeting?”</p><p> </p><p>“He did. He was a mercenary, he was hired to help protect you, and he nearly died doing it.”</p><p> </p><p>“That is all true,” Rhea confirmed, “Jeralt saved my life. He threw himself into harm's way to save me from death. He was a very brave young man. Very young at the time, in fact. He could not even grow a full beard back then!”</p><p> </p><p>The archbishop smiled, full of fondness and good humor, and Byleth felt all the more uncomfortable for it.</p><p> </p><p>“I imagine then that he told you of how he joined the Knights of Seiros?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, of course, I did think he would, given you said he told you…I digress. I seem to be talking in circles now. I do enjoy speaking with you though.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth didn’t know what to say to that. Part of her wanted to ask ‘why’. Another part wanted to know what Rhea did all those years ago, what happened to her mother, everything. But the largest part just wanted to leave. “Is that all then, Lady Rhea?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I suppose it is. My apologies if I have made you uncomfortable, child.” Was it that obvious? “I do hope you might be willing to visit again. Perhaps not for business, but simply to chat.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, thank you. I’m busy,” Byleth replied, before turning and walking away as fast as she could without looking like she was running from the archbishop and that strangely hurt look she had when Byleth refused her.</p><hr /><p>“-and that is all for today, class,” Hanneman concluded, turning away from the blackboard and towards his students, “Remember to study hard, as we will be having a test at the end of the week!”</p><p> </p><p>Shez frowned at her notes. She was…pretty sure she knew enough about the leadership skills of previous Faerghan generals, but maybe she should stop by the library for once? But then she might run into that Tomas guy again and he still felt off to her.</p><p> </p><p>“It is an interesting sensation, don’t you think?” Arval asked as she started packing her stuff away, “Not exactly familiar, per se, but–Oh? Never mind, it looks like we can’t converse at the moment.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” Shez glanced up at Arval, then paused when she saw Sylvain instead.</p><p> </p><p>“Heh, hey there! Saw me coming, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ehh…something like that. What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? I can't come over and chat with a cute classmate?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, it was one of those conversations. “Nope, not really. I’ve got better things to do than be flirted at.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, that’s not really why I wanted to talk. I mean, sure, I wouldn’t mind flirting if you were up for it–”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not,” Shez replied, slinging her satchel of school supplies over her shoulder, “So see ya.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, hold on, I actually did want to talk,” Sylvain quickly said, prompting a sigh from his classmate.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, I guess I’m not doing anything, so I’m up to hear whatever it is. What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, maybe we could find somewhere more private to chat–”</p><p> </p><p>“Sylvain, come on.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious. I don’t want to talk about something you might find uncomfortable for other people to hear.” At her skeptical look, he continued. “It’s about you and your sister.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. That.” She grimaced. “I guess our argument was kind of…in the open.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it was kind of hard not to notice, though I don’t think anyone listened in. Or at least was close enough to listen in on.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Did you try to listen in?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I’m not that bad,” he complained, “Besides, argument aside, I just noticed things seemed to be tense between you two. I guess I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, things are fine…mostly.” Shez sighed. “I just…yeah, maybe we should go somewhere less open to talk about this. Though if you invite me to a bedroom, I’m gonna deck you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, message received!” And moments later, the two settled in a corner of the monastery’s halls, far from most of the foot traffic.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, talk to me. Are things really so bad you decided you need to get involved?” Shez asked, leaning against the wall as Sylvain stood beside her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d say it’s more that I want to keep things from getting that bad. I, ah…kind of have experience with this sort of thing. I have an older brother and…well, he was born without a crest.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Okay?”</p><p> </p><p>He sighed, smiling wryly. “Alright, I guess it’s not too obvious since you two grew up as mercenaries. See, the way it goes in the nobility in Faerghus is that the heir needs to have a crest. I’m sure you’ve heard the stories, how we’re descended from the Ten Elites and how we all have relics that react to crests. You need a crest to wield them and each one is worth a thousand men, or so the stories go.</p><p> </p><p>“Crests are everything to nobles. It’s proof the Goddess favors us, or so people say. And if you’re born without a crest…well, you’re not the favorite.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay? So…your brother was born without a crest, and then you were born with one?”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly. Though, that’s not all of it. After Miklan, my brother, lost his mother, our father married specifically to make me. He needed an heir with a crest, and the instant I was born, Miklan lost what should’ve been his. And he hated me for it.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez frowned. “That’s not fair at all. You didn’t ask to be born with a crest. You didn’t ask to be born at all.”</p><p> </p><p>“True enough, but I was. And, well…” He chuckled without any humor in it. “He made sure I knew how much he hated me. Tried to kill me a few times, even. All because I had a crest and he didn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hold on, you can’t seriously think that’s what’s going on between me and Byleth.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not? So you can tell me you never felt resentful towards her because of her crest.”</p><p> </p><p>She scowled in the face of his skepticism. “It’s not that! I’m mad that she’s acting like I need protection!”</p><p> </p><p>“So you never once thought she had an unfair advantage? That you would have been better off if she didn’t have a crest?”</p><p> </p><p>“I never thought I would be better off! I–Look, sure, it felt weird when I learned she had one, but I didn’t hate her for it!”</p><p> </p><p>“And that’s good!” Sylvain insisted, “I don’t want you to hate her! I just don’t want things to turn out like they did with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“...They’re not going to. I don’t hate Byleth. I’m just upset that she wants to baby me. It’s not the same as what happened to you.” Shez let out a breath, relaxing some of the tension that built up in her. “I just want her to know I’m as strong as her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stronger,” murmured Arval, and Shez felt a flash of annoyance at the sound of their voice.</p><p> </p><p>“...Alright. I won’t keep arguing that. Just…I feel like it’s unfair to you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not weak, Sylvain. You don’t need to protect me either.”</p><p> </p><p>“...heh. Fair enough.” He slouched against the wall and let out another sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez settled next to him after a second, content to stare at the opposite wall. “...What do you think of Byleth anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, if I’m going to be honest, my first thought is that she’s completely gorgeous and probably has the third biggest set of breasts I’ve ever seen.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Wow, you really are a pig.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ouch. Hitting me right in the heart there, Shez.”</p><p> </p><p>“I could hit you for real if you want.” She paused. “Third biggest?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup. Professor Manuela’s are bigger, but she’s still the second biggest. The absolute biggest goes to the court mage back in Faerghus, this lady named Cornelia. Now those things are absolutely massive. Praise the goddess for low cut dresses and the ladies who like them.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I really feel like I should deck you on principle now.”</p><p> </p><p>“If you do, just don’t aim for my face. It’s my only redeeming quality.” He grinned as Shez laughed at his bad joke, before he settled back again. “...And, if I’m continuing to be honest, I’ve gotta say, I’m kind of jealous of her.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez glanced up at him. “You are?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup. See, for us nobles, having a crest means that’s all anyone is ever going to value us for. We’re the subject of envy and desire because of the blood we have, and those of us ‘lucky’ enough to be born with one immediately become valuable. I was tested at birth to make sure I had one, and that was all I needed to become the heir. And now, all I have waiting for me is a future as a studhorse, producing enough crested babies to be the next generation of Gautier lords keeping the wheels of society turning. Why do you think I never stick with the women I flirt with? It’s because they all want the same thing: wealth and status from a man of good breeding.</p><p> </p><p>“For how vaunted my position is, I was born without any freedom. Meanwhile, your sister got to live the free life of a mercenary. Nobody pretended to like her, nobody demanded she pick a spouse to carry on the line, no one had any expectations of her at all. She didn’t even know she had a crest until she came here. How lucky is that? She gets all of the benefits and none of the downsides. What else is that but unfair?</p><p> </p><p>He laughed again, though it was darker this time. Uglier, almost. “It feels like she has an unpaid debt, getting to live the easy life like that. Maybe someone ought to collect on it…” </p><p> </p><p>After a second, Sylvain chuckled. “Ah, never mind. Hope I didn’t scare you there, Shez. Most ladies like a dark and brooding noble.”</p><p> </p><p>He glanced at her, then felt his body tense on instinct at the look Shez was giving him. There was no smile on her face. No hint of humor, but no hint of concern either. Her eyes were narrowed as she stared up to him, and he felt himself back up, only to hit the wall.</p><p> </p><p>And Shez moved closer to him. Despite the height difference between them, he felt himself staring up at her as she slammed her hand into the wall beside his head, glaring straight into his eyes. There was a fiery orange gleam in there that he hadn’t seen before and white markings down her scowling face.</p><p> </p><p>“I like you, Sylvain,” she said. Her tone implied the opposite. “Don’t pile your self-pitying bullshit on me or my sister. And if you ever threaten Byleth again, I’ll kill you.”</p><p> </p><p>She pushed off the wall and stalked away, her hair still glowing that fiery orange.</p><p> </p><p>Sylvain watched her go, then look at the blackened hole beside his head in the vague shape of a hand. Despite being solid stone, it reeked of rot. He felt a nervous laugh bubble up as he realized his legs were bent and barely supporting him. </p><p> </p><p>“H-Hah…well…so much for an honest conversation…”</p><hr /><p>“Professor, can I ask why you seem so discomfited lately?” Edelgard inquired, directing the question towards her professor across the tea table.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused, before setting down her teacup. “Ah…Do I seem especially…discomfited?”</p><p> </p><p>“You do. You’ve been on edge.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have good reason to be. People might be trying to assassinate the Archbishop.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard raised an eyebrow. “I suppose that is a decent reason. I believe there may be more to it though.”</p><p> </p><p>“...We should focus on our mission for the month. I’ve been investigating likely points of attack for infiltrators and I believe it would be good to spread our patrols out to those areas.”</p><p> </p><p>“I understand completely, and I would appreciate it if we could discuss these matters further. Perhaps during class time and not leisure time?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked, then glanced at the tea table with all its snacks and such. “...Right, that is a good point. I don’t really want to talk about my…discomfit though.”</p><p> </p><p>“Discomfort, professor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard decided to take a gamble. “Is it about Shez?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Oh…I hope not. I was hoping things were better between us…did she say there were problems?”</p><p> </p><p>The princess shook her head. “I have not had cause to speak with her recently. I presume this issue relates to our previous mission though.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah. We argued about it. I was…I felt scared for the first time because I saw her get–nearly get hurt.”</p><p> </p><p>“You did? Hm…I suppose that makes two emotions that you can feel strongly now.” Edelgard mused as she sipped her tea, Hresvelg blend this time. "Forgive me if this sounds rude, but has she not been in dangerous situations before as a mercenary?" </p><p> </p><p>"She has but… this time was different, she let down her guard. If I was just a bit slower, he would have stabbed her through the chest." Byleth said, unable to get the image of Shez bleeding out of her head. </p><p> </p><p>"I see. Does that mean you don't want her to participate in combat then?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, I just don't want her to be reckless anymore," Byleth muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"I suppose I can understand that. To lose one's family is tragic." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, sorry," Byleth apologized as she remembered what happened to Edelgard. </p><p> </p><p>"No need to apologize, professor. We all have our own fears, but I believe they can be used as a reminder to not allow anything like that to happen again. Or ever happen, in this case." </p><p> </p><p>"...If I can ask, what happened to you?" </p><p> </p><p>"That is a rather vague question, professor. What exactly do you mean?" </p><p> </p><p>"This is just my guess but whatever happened to you seems to motivate you greatly but…if it was just that sickness, you would be more focused on learning about healing and medicines, and not trying to grow stronger." </p><p> </p><p>"...you are quite perceptive, professor." </p><p> </p><p>"I have to be, with how reckless Shez is." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Setting her tea cup down, Edelgard flicked her wrist, seemingly giving out a signal as some nearby bushes rustled, telling Byleth that Hubert left. "...Before I begin, I must say, there really is a strange aura about you. It makes me feel as if I can really trust you." </p><p> </p><p>"I'll take that as a good thing." </p><p> </p><p>"You should. Now… you know what happened to my siblings, correct?" At Byleth’s nod, Edelgard took a sip of her tea to calm her nerves. "Before I tell you, you must swear to not tell another soul." </p><p> </p><p>"I swear," Byleth said with no hesitation. </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, your honesty can be quite refreshing, professor. If I am also being honest, then that story is just a cover, meant to hide what really happened. My family was… experimented on. There were those who wished to gain something from us, and it cost my siblings their lives." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." Byleth wasn’t sure what to say. </p><p> </p><p>"While I would prefer not to go into details, there was a reason I alone survived, and was named the heir of the Empire. The future of the Empire, of everything, depends on me," Edelgard said, resolute as she stared at Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"...I see. So that's why you're always appraising me. For the future you want to make." </p><p> </p><p>"I really should not be surprised by how perceptive you are." </p><p> </p><p>"Perhaps. Still, if I can help you find a better future, even if it's only as a teacher, then I will." </p><p> </p><p>"...Thank you, my teacher." </p>

  <p>
  <span>Flayn was having a very interesting year at the monastery! To be specific, it was her first year there, but it was still exciting! Sure, her father might not have let her join as a student, but being able to interact with all the students was ever the delight, even more so when the mysterious band of mercenaries arrived! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn't know much about them, but Lady Rhea seemed to trust them, even if her father didn't, so they were probably nice people. And the daughters of the leader were quite the duo, be it saving the house leaders, causing quite the stir at the mock battle, or just the general shenanigans at the academy, they quickly became the talk of the town as it were. And while she herself had yet to meet the younger sibling, the elder was ever so much a delight! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was quite amusing seeing her seem so surprised that Flayn and Seteth were related, even if it was just the slight widening of her eyes. It wasn't the first time someone got the wrong idea, especially with how stern her father was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a shame she was unable to attend the academy as a student, as it seemed quite fun with the two of them. Perhaps she'd have a chance next year, provided the elder remained as a teacher anyways. Though, as she thought this, she saw the younger Eisner sister sitting together with Leonie in the dining hall, the former glaring at the book in her hands. With a smile, she approached the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Greetings, you must be Shez Eisner," Flayn greeted with a curtsy, catching Shez off guard as she looked up from her book. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, uh, hi?" Shez said back, seemingly unsure if she should get up to curtsy as well. "Uh… Leonie, is this one of your classmates?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Seriously? You don't know who Seteth’s sister is?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, she's Seteth’s-..." She paused, then looked at Flayn, before glancing back at Leonie. "Are you sure?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pretty sure you're the last person who should be surprised at how different siblings can be." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez raised a finger, thought for a second, then lowered it. “Yeah okay, that’s fair. It’s just…Seteth’s really tall and harsh-looking, and this girl’s small and soft, like one of those plush things.” She paused, then glanced at Flayn, who was not small and soft and was frowning at her in response. “Hey so what’s your name anyway?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My name is Flayn, and I am neither small nor soft,” Flayn replied quite firmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm…” Shez stood up from the table, showing that she was indeed much taller than Flayn and prompting a bigger frown from the shorter girl. “I don’t think you can argue with me on the small part, you’re pretty short, and you look really soft. I probably can’t test that part though, not without Seteth getting really mad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...How were you planning to test ‘softness’?” Leonie asked with a raised eyebrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pinch her cheeks, duh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I firmly request you do not do that,” Flayn firmly requested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, okay. So did you need something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I came to say hello, but you have been quite rude."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Ah, sorry, that’s my bad, I wasn’t thinking. Probably should, I just talked with Lysithea about not treating her like a kid…Okay! Let’s start from the top again!” Shez grinned, then tried her own attempt at a curtsy. It didn’t really look right, but she gave it a try. “Hi there! My name is Shez Eisner, also known as the Violet Demon, daughter of Jeralt the Blade Breaker and sister to Byleth the Ashen Dragon!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn’s frown turned to a bright smile at Shez’s full, proper introduction and curtsied in turn. “Hello Shez! My name is Flayn, sister of Seteth the grouchy chamberlain. It is a pleasure to meet you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pff–Is his title really ‘the grouchy chamberlain’?” Shez asked, grinning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is what people call him,” Flayn replied, acting innocent, though her own smile showed her humor, “I have also heard him called ‘the stern watchman of the monastery’ and ‘sour, dour Seteth’.” Left unsaid was how it was a certain aunt of hers that happened to call him the latter. “Ah, and, um…this may be strange to ask, but your sister is not an actual dragon, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretty sure she’s not. She’s just good at fire magic and I wanted her to have a cool title like mine. She doesn’t like being called a demon, so I figured calling her a dragon would be good. Dragons and demons are kind of opposites, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? How are they opposites?” Leonie asked while Flayn just nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That makes perfect sense!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Leonie blinked. “It does?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, grinned wider. “Hell yeah it does! Heh, glad someone else recognizes my genius! You’re pretty cool, Flayn.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am? Ah, well thank you for saying so!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, no problem! Hey so are you a student here? You’ve got the uniform, kind of, but it looks different.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, well…I am not officially a student,” Flayn admitted, “I wish to attend, but my brother did not want me to join any of the classes this year. Ah, but I will most definitely be joining next year!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright! Then I’ll look forward to seeing you then!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, Shez, we only attend the Academy for a year,” Leonie pointed out, “You’ll graduate by next  year.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right. Huh…Well, dang, guess we won’t have classes together then. But you do hang around the monastery anyways, right? Maybe we can hang out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would love that!” Flayn exclaimed, smiling brightly, “I have spoken with the other students at times, but I haven’t really ‘hung out’ with someone before!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, then you can hang out with us right now! C’mon, sit!” Shez insisted, taking her seat again and patting the spot next to her. So of course Flayn eagerly accepted the offer!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you! Ah, so what are you two doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was having lunch, and Shez was glaring at her book,” Leonie answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not glaring, I’m concentrating,” Shez explained, pointing to the ornate black book, “This stuff’s complicated.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? What is it about, if I may ask?” Flayn inquired.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dark magic. I’m pretty good at it, but I don’t know a ton, so Lysithea helped me out and gave me this book of it. Some of the bigger spells get really complicated so it’s been tricky for me to figure out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I see.” Flayn wasn’t quite sure how to feel about that revelation. She wasn’t particularly fond of dark magic, especially with the memories it brought up, but she was impressed to see Shez was working hard to better herself. “Well, I’m sure you’ll get it soon enough!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, thanks! How about you? Do you have anything going on today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, not especially. It is my birthday, so I imagine Seteth has some surprise planned–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s your birthday?” Shez interrupted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Your birthday is on Saint Cethleann’s Day?” Leonie asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes to both questions!” Flayn answered with a bright smile. "It was quite fortuitous for me to share a saint's birthday." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, uh…" Glancing around, Shez grabbed a sweet bun off a plate she was eating from. "Here you go!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, thank you!" Flayn said, quite happy to have a delicious treat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You really need to eat more than just sweets, you know," Leonie said, frowning at Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I do eat more than that, I’m just having these because Lysithea says sugar helps the brain!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pretty sure she just says that so she can get away with having as many sweets as she can." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, I’m pretty sure she’s right. She’s really smart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not denying that, but she can still lie. That girl has a really big sweet tooth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, until proven otherwise, I'll take her advice." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think Lysithea makes a good point,” Flayn mentioned in between munching on her treat, “My mind works much better after having something sweet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah see? Proof!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Leonie sighed. “No offense, but I don’t think Flayn’s an expert on the subject.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She might be. How about it, Flayn? Are you an expert on food stuff?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn paused mid bite then felt a smile come to her face. “I would not call myself an expert, but I have created many dishes that my brother has called extraordinary!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Heh, you know, I’m something of a cook too. Think they’d let us make something if we asked the kitchen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, certainly! We should go right now!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Yeah alright, let’s do it!” Shez said, pushing herself up from the table before quite casually picking Flayn up from her seat and setting her down, earning a surprised blink from the shorter girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Um, you are very strong, Shez, but please do not do that again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sorry. Okay, no picking you up without permission, got it.” Shez gave her a thumbs up while Leonie let out a sigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shouldn’t that be obvious? You shouldn’t be grabbing anyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I did it without thinking! Besides, I’m pretty sure I saw you pick up Ignatz once.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Leonie waved a hand. “That’s different, he’s a classmate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t get how that’s different, but alright. Anyways, c’mon Flayn, let’s go make something!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>About half an hour later, Shez stared at the bubbling, blackened ruin in the pot that Flayn was happily stirring, taking note of what looked like chunks of what she thought had to be fish in it, because she’d been cutting up a Teutates Pike for the dish, and yet…whatever those lumps were, they didn’t look like fish.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hey Flayn?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Yes Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What did you say this dish was called again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Immortality Stew! They say it makes those who dine upon it hardier and more durable!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh.” She stared at the…concoction in the pot, taking note of how it seemed somehow both purple and green in parts of it. The colors vaguely reminded her of when her dad’s mercs had been hired to hunt down a demonic beast. The chunks looked almost like that thing’s blue-gray scales, and the broth was vaguely like the poison saliva it had… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do not eat that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused, then glanced at Arval, who had a deeply disturbed expression on their face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is the single most toxic brew I have ever seen. You would die. Or at least have severe stomach troubles for the rest of the day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez turned her gaze back to the Immortality Stew. She couldn’t help but think that stew was supposed to be easy. You just put things in a pot and boil it. So how did… “Uh…hm. Hey Flayn, you said it was your birthday, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Yes, I did! You gave me a bun as a present, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, I remember, but I just had a thought that we should do something bigger to celebrate! Like, say, heading into town! We could go buy some more sweets and…maybe a cookbook, also.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh! That sounds like a wonderful idea! Though, is it fine to leave the stew on the fire like this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh totally. I’ve cooked before, remember? I’ll just tell the kitchen staff about it, they can do whatever they want with it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, very well then!” Flayn hopped from her stool and began undoing her apron while Shez moved over to one of the cooks and very quickly muttered to them that no one should, under any circumstances, eat from that pot in particular, before heading out to help Flayn enjoy her birthday, far from any kitchens.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span> "So, do you live at the monastery?" Shez asked as they walked around the town.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do, but I only recently began living here. My brother decided it was best for me to move here, and I’m quite glad with that decision.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh, where did you live before?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…I would prefer not to talk about it,” Flayn replied, not wanting to explain that she lived in Zanados.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh, sure. Sorry if I brought up bad memories.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, not so much bad, just lonely ones.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Then it’s a good thing there’s so many people around here!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Quite! This is the first time I’ve been able to go out shopping, much less with a friend. Brother doesn’t let me go out shopping, though he makes sure to go out when I request something and he has time,” Flayn explained, a smile on her face as she looked around town.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. You know, he almost sounds more like your dad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Huh? Wh-Why would you assume such a thing!?” Flayn asked, worried her cover was blown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, I was just joking?” Shez responded, wondering why Flayn was acting like that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh, okay good. Uh…oh hey, those are also students of the academy, no?” Flayn inquired as she pointed over at Lorenz and Sylvain…who were attempting and failing at flirting with townsfolk. Which, while funny, did make Shez frown as she looked at Sylvain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, we probably should stay away from them.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that’s a bit funny. Brother also said the same thing to me about those two.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh, guess Seteth isn’t that bad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He also said the same thing about you and your sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you shouldn't listen to him sometimes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn giggled. “Perhaps. He’s often far too protective, though I can understand his concerns. Well, some of them. I don’t think his insistence that I not speak with any male students is warranted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, seriously? He actually said that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Something to that effect…though I can somewhat understand his reasoning, looking at those two,” she noted, referring to Sylvain and Lorenz, who weren’t having any more luck with their “contest”. Especially since Sylvain was just punched in the stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, ouch. Shouldn’t have gone for Gertrude.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you know her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, she’s a mercenary from the same company as me. Maybe we should go say–...Actually, let’s not go say hi to her, she’d be a bad influence.” She did smoke, after all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn paused, then pouted. “Now you are sounding a good deal like my brother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, he’s not completely wrong. Just mostly. I’m a great influence, for instance! I’m pretty sure if we train together, I can help you get super strong!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…I’m not sure that’s the same type of influence my brother is talking about…” Flayn paused again, considering Shez’s suggestion. And wondering just what it would be like to have big muscles… “...Raphael has helped me grow stronger by aiding me with my battle cry. Would it be something like that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, stuff like that is important. Helps you keep your mind focused.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Raphael didn’t mention that…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, he is a lot more muscular than me, so I guess he does his screaming for another reason…hm…no, no, I focus on speed, big muscles would get in the way.” She tilted her head, crossing her arms over her chest. “I think. Because you’re heavier? Right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…I believe so?” Though, now that Flayn thought about it, she used to be pretty big in dragon form and she was still fast then. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…we should find someone smarter than us,” Shez said with a nod, before glancing around to find someone. “Hm…can’t ask Sylvain, he’s terrible and I don’t like him…Lorenz would be too pompous about it…Oh hey! HEY LYSITHEA!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Shez? Why are you yelling?” the mage asked as she glanced over at the pair, a small bag in hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, do muscles make you slower?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Lysithea glanced at Flayn. “Can you explain why she’s asking that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, we were talking about training together, and Shez started to wonder if she should train to get bigger muscles.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes, Shez, muscles make you slower. Also I thought I was your mentor? Why are you suddenly trying to be more muscular?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, do magic and muscles not go together?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mages wear light enchanted clothes and usually aren't the most defended. So as it stands being big and muscular just means you’ll be a bigger target. So if you want to be fast and use magic, getting big muscles isn’t the best option.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Yeah that makes sense,” Shez said as she nodded. “Oh yeah, so what are you doing out here?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was asked to do some errands. The storage was running low on soap so they asked me to get some for our class chores.” Lysithea glanced between the two. “So what are you two doing here?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, it’s Flayn’s birthday, so we were shopping for a cookbook for her, and maybe some sweets. Do you wanna join?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well, I might as well come along to make sure you don’t get lost.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pff, like I could get lost here. C’mon, I know exactly where I’m going!” Shez declared, before walking right towards the gates leading out of town, prompting an annoyed noise from Lysithea and a confused sound from Flayn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Er…is that where the cookbooks are sold?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, she’s just stupid. Come along, let’s catch up to her,” Lysithea decided, leading the way as Flayn smiled. She really should head into town more often.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"If you had wanted to go into town, you could have asked me and I would have gone with you," Seteth chided, a frown on his face as he looked down at a pouting Flayn, who had seen Shez and Lysithea off earlier after their nice day on the town. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is it really so wrong that I hang out with a friend?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I never said that, I just want to make sure you're safe, and I don't think ‘hanging out’ with a mercenary is safe." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez is my friend, and I kindly ask that you treat her as such!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Friend or not, you should still be careful. She has already caused a lot of trouble at the Academy, and I don't want her to be a bad influence on you." </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, I fail to see how buying a cookbook can constitute as a bad influence," Flayn responded, getting Seteth to sigh. She neglected to mention them running into a bear while trying to find Shez outside the monastery walls. Lysithea and Shez easily dispatched it, so it wasn’t like it was an actual problem. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just please make sure to inform me if you're heading out again, okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me," Looking over, the father and daughter pair saw Byleth approaching them, some flowers in hand. "Is everything okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing that should matter to you, professor. Did you require something?" Seteth asked, turning to face her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A few things. First, Flayn, were you the one who made the stew in the kitchen?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, that I was! Shez and I were cooking before we decided to head out into town together." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, Dimitri wanted to know who cooked that, apparently he enjoyed it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He did?" Both Flayn and Seteth asked, the latter sounding far more surprised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, apparently he liked the texture? I didn't have any myself, but it sounded interesting. Oh, but I wanted to give you these." Extending the flowers she had, Byleth handed over the bouquet of forget-me-nots to Flayn. "You like these flowers, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, absolutely, thank you professor!" Flayn said, smiling as she took the bouquet. "How did you know?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I notice these kinds of things," Byleth replied, before glancing at Seteth. "Actually, when is your birthday? The records I have only list the student’s birthday." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There is no need-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Brother's birthday is on Saint Cichol's day, and he quite enjoys fishing if you want an idea for what to get him!" Flayn cut in with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Fishing is enjoyable," Byleth agreed with a nod. "I actually caught a crayfish recently, that I'm keeping as a pet." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You did? May I see them?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, I named them Snappy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh what a wonderful name!” Flayn said, smiling as she followed behind Byleth. Sighing, Seteth watched the two walk away…then started to think. If Professor Byleth was keeping a pet, then it would likely be in her room. Which meant she was leading Flayn to her room…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, get back here! I need to discuss with you what is and isn't appropriate conduct!” Seteth shouted, chasing after the two.</span>

  <span>“So, my Deer will be handling the reception hall while your Eagles patrol the cathedral and Hanneman’s Lions keep watch over the vault,” Manuela said, glancing up at her fellow professors as they stood around a map of the monastery, “Does that all sound right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It does,” Byleth confirmed, before pausing, “Were we going to send anyone to keep an eye on the stables, or are we ignoring that idea?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I can send a few of my kids to keep watch over there if you really think it’s such a concerning idea,” Manuela offered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We should make sure we don’t spread out too far,” Hanneman noted, “If there really is an attack tonight, we don’t want any students to get caught isolated from everyone else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. Where’s Rhea going to be during this?” Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“At the Goddess Tower, giving a sermon to the faithful. We shouldn’t need to worry about her. The Knights of Seiros, your father included, will be guarding her with their lives.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We do have quite the selection of guards for Lady Rhea,” Manuela said, “Thunder Catherine, Shamir the Distant Archer, and…Well, Alois will be there too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…Okay. It sounds like she’ll be safe then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Are you worried for our archbishop?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. The primary objective is to keep her safe, so it’s good to know I won’t need to divert resources to do so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Manuela blinked. “...Well, I can’t fault your pragmatism. Though you should be careful on how you phrase that sort of thing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…should we have a plan in mind in case one of our houses does encounter unexpected troubles?” Hanneman asked his fellow professors. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. It might be good to have a student be ready to go ask for assistance,” Byleth offered, “Someone who is a fast runner preferably.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That makes sense,” Manuela agreed, “At the very least they should inform the knights if they do find intruders.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Though they should also make sure not to cause a panic,” Hanneman pointed out, “It is a very important day after all, and with how many noncombatants there will be at the ceremony, who knows what might happen if chaos were to erupt.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s also true, and I would hate for anyone to get hurt. Hopefully we don’t end up facing any problems, and the knights on patrol have everything handled,” Manuela said with a sigh. “This year has been quite hectic, and we haven’t even reached the halfway point. I hope we’ll be able to get to the grand ball so the students can have some fun.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Grand ball?” Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh right, we haven’t told you. Near the end of the year, we tend to hold a ball for the students. You know, let them eat and dance, maybe let some romance bloom,” Manuela explained with a fond smile. One that turned mischievous barely a second later. “Why, there’s even a legend that if a man and a woman go to the goddess tower and make a vow together, it’ll come true.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do keep in mind that no one is allowed in the goddess tower outside of the rite of rebirth,” Hanneman interrupted, frowning at his fellow professor, “I would think you would know not to spread any rumors, Manuela.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, what's the harm in having a little fun? Besides, I'm sure everyone will be busy dancing the night away~!” She sighed. “Shame we’ll have to be chaperoning the entire event.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because someone needs to make sure the students don't break any rules.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know that, you don’t need to get all huffy with me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huffy? I’m just reminding you-” And as their argument continued to pick up, Byleth began to slowly back away from them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good luck you two,” she said, before leaving, though neither really noticed as their argument started getting more heated. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Hm, it seems the Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. Shall we be assuming our positions?” Hubert asked Byleth as the Black Eagles waited in the cathedral. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Petra, are you ready to go for backup in case anything happens?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course professor! None shall be as swift of leg as I!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think you mean swift-footed, Petra,” Dorothea gently corrected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good. Now remember everyone, if anyone does come by here, our primary goal is to stop them from escaping,” Byleth stated, “Don’t do anything dangerous if you don’t need to, and make sure to fall back if need be.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I’ll make sure to k-keep that in mind!” Bernadetta squeaked, looking ready to bolt already.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure everything will be okay,” Edelgard reassured, “Even if the enemy manages to sneak their way in, I doubt they’ll have many men with them.” Besides, she thought, the only dangerous one would probably be the Death Knight, who likely wouldn’t listen to any soldier the slithers were controlling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We should still be careful, but for now, everyone, make sure to keep an eye out.” Byleth instructed, dismissing her students as they all moved to hide. It took some time, but eventually the class saw several robed figures who looked like priests approach where they were hiding, making their way to the mausoleum beneath the cathedral. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seems we hit the mark, my teacher,”  Edelgard said from where she was crouched by Byleth before they stood up, signaling to the class to follow them as they chased the ‘priests’. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And it seemed they were indeed correct as they walked into the mausoleum and saw several figures moving about the vast room, examining what seemed to be coffins and taking up defensive positions. Including the apparent leader at the other end of the room, a man in the clothes and bird-like mask of a dark mage, though Church white instead of the standard black, who seemed to spot them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Those central church dastards spotted us! Quick, hold them off!” he shouted, before focusing on the coffin he was next to, trying to undo a magical seal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re after the tomb of the Saint Seiros. What would they want with some bones…” Edelgard muttered, trying to keep up appearances, before she spotted the Death Knight. “Hm, that one seems dangerous. We should try–” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And whatever she was about to say was cut off as the Death Knight threw his scythe straight across the room, the massive weapon nearly cleaving Byleth in half if she didn’t block it. Even then, she skidded back from the force before she managed to fling it away, though it quickly returned to the Death Knight’s hand in a flash of blood-red light.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“FINALLY. WORTHY PREY.” the demonic figure intoned, before his horse rear back and charged straight at Byleth, who felt her eyes widen–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No, she didn’t have time to think. “MOVE!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her students hastened to obey, most moving on reflex, and Byleth internally cursed as she took notice of just how many other foes there were all throughout the room. Monks and mages made up the bulk of the force–Then she was rolling out of the way, her mind racing as the black horse nearly ran her down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had to duck again, a scythe blade swinging over head, all while Edelgard stared in shock nearby. The Death Knight shouldn’t be going after the professor, he had no reason to–And Edelgard felt herself cursing in her own thoughts as she remembered that night when she first saw the professor genuinely angry. Which was also when she had nearly beaten Jeritza to death. Of course his more vicious personality would take an interest in the professor, and Edelgard was a damned fool not to realize it!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“FORGET ME! I’LL HANDLE HIM!” Byleth shouted, and Edelgard felt the strangest pang of fear because her professor never shouted. “DO NOT DRAW HIS ATTENTION!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pointed straight at the leader of the invaders at the end of the room, her arm outstretched behind her as she kept her eyes straight on the Death Knight. “He’s the one we need dead! Keep your eyes out, stay in groups of four! Edelgard, Ferdinand, Hubert, Dorothea, left side! Linhardt, Caspar, Bernadetta, Emily, right side! NO ARGUING, JUST MOVE!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard swallowed her response, and simply nodded, moving to obey as she hoisted her axe and shield.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, we can’t really leave her–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ferdinand, now is not the time for this!” Edelgard insisted, shooting her classmate a scowl, “The professor gave us our order, now hurry up!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I SEE. SO YOU SEEK TO KEEP OUR BOUT BETWEEN US. VERY WELL.” The Death Knight inclined his head, respecting Byleth’s decision…before he started to laugh. “FINALLY…COME! LET US SEE IF YOU ARE ABLE TO KILL ME!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth didn’t reply. She wasn’t just waiting for him to make a move, she was preparing, and her sword glowed with light as she imbued it with as much magic as she could manage in the moment. There was no chance this fight could be taken as anything less than deadly seriously, especially with the time limit of the mage attempting to open the coffin at the end of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But she had no time to think about that. She had every disadvantage in this fight: her opponent’s scythe had a longer reach in addition to obvious magical properties, he was on horseback, and she had to keep an eye out for her students. The only solution, considering all of those factors, was to remove those advantages.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A near impossible prospect, but one she had to go for as he urged his horse to charge her again. So she flung a fireball straight at his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Death Knight swung straight through the ball of flame, dispersing it easily, though his distraction meant another one slammed straight into his horse’s face a second later. Unfortunately for Byleth, the Death Knight’s steed was not one that reacted to having flames burst against it. The armor it wore dispersed the damage, but more than that, it didn’t even react to having fire that close to its eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“PALTRY TRICKS. COME, FACE ME WITH YOUR TRUE FURY!” the Death Knight ordered as he aimed to run her down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned, but a fight like this wasn’t the kind of thing that made her angry. It just made her focus. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved again, leaping to the side and lightning crackled around her free hand before a bolt caught the knight in the side, earning an actual grunt of pain before he turned and thrust the spearpoint of his scythe towards her, which she had to drop to avoid. Dodging to the side wouldn’t be easy with how wide the blades of his scythe were, yet she had to move quickly to get back to her feet. Being prone in front of a man on horseback was certain death; she’d seen what hooves could do to a human body and if she fell under a warhorse, she would die, simple as that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So how did a swordswoman on foot fight against an armored knight on horseback? Simply put, she didn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a reason why cavalry was king on the battlefield, and Byleth hadn’t thought to bring any sort of polearm that might give her enough reach to do damage. There was the option of wearing him down with magic–Something that seemed equally difficult as she was forced to leap over a coffin to avoid another charge–but armor like that would disperse fire and thunder, assuming she could even hit him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she noticed an arrow plink off his armor and turned her attention towards Bernadetta, who looked absolutely terrified to see her shot be completely ineffective. But it did give Byleth an idea, because there was a nearby archer aiming at her students.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“GET BACK HERE!” the Death Knight snarled as his opponent fled from him. Fled, like a coward! He urged his steed after her, his mouth curled into a vicious scowl beneath his helm, when an arrow nearly took his eye. A narrow movement saved him from losing his sight and he felt that very same eye widen as he saw his foe wielding a bow she’d ripped from the hands of an archer she had decapitated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Death Knight had no need of something as worthless as a shield. He desired a fight to the death, after all, and an emphasis on defense would get in the way of that. But he did come to understand why some people would use them as an arrow nearly punched through his breastplate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Bernie! Focus on the enemy though!” Byleth shouted, drawing another arrow from the dead man’s quiver and launching it straight towards center mass, focused on guaranteeing hits over trying to be fancy with it. If she could put an arrow through the knight’s eyes though, well, she wouldn’t be unhappy with that result.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“INTERESTING…” The Death Knight’s foe truly was shrewd, though a fight at a distance was not what he desired. He wanted to hear the clash of steel, enjoy the reek of blood in the air, and feel her fists breaking his body once more. He needed her fury…and that thought drew his eye towards the small archer girl that tried to put an arrow in his shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…His master could accept one death.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Death Knight spurred his horse forward, eyes locking on his target–Then his body seized as thunder crashed into his back. He urged his steed back, the beast obeying without hesitation as he whirled to face his intended foe–Then he heard the beast scream at the sensation of steel biting into an unarmored part of its body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His looked down, trying to catch sight of his foe, though he only did once he lifted his eyes and saw her leap from a coffin, blade shining as she swung it for his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“FINALLY!” he cheered, swinging his scythe in turn and catching her blade on its pole. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth grit her teeth as the knight pushed her back, landing and rolling to her feet on the ground–Before her eyes widened in genuine surprise as the knight fully leapt from his horse and tried to bring his scythe down on her head. It missed her by inches, cutting some hair as she ducked, before she raced in close, trying to take advantage before he could bring it back around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She scored a cut across his chest, not deep enough to put him down, and he connected with a kick to her chest that sent her back, not quite knocking the wind from her lungs–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Death Knight lunged, raising his scythe high before lightning filled his vision, a bolt of thunder crashing against his head. The smell of burnt air filled his nose, almost overtaking the scent of blood. He almost felt thankful for his master and her allies for killing all who stood in their way; the reek of spilled blood made this fight ever more enjoyable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He continued his advance, swinging in wide arcs to try to cut down the first foe in ages to make him truly feel alive. And she proved her mettle just as he hoped, deflecting or dodging every swing and returning with strikes of her own that scored against his armor, scratching the surface. He twisted and spun his scythe, uncaring of what blows she might land in favor of seeking her blood. He could see the light fade from her blade as sweat beaded her skin, the song of battle wearing down on her even as it invigorated him. It wasn’t enough though. She needed more rage if she were to face him properly, so how could he–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then his attention was caught by more figures in white entering the tomb. He considered them, wondering if they were allied to his master or perhaps foes he was allowed to butcher while allowing his foe a moment of reprieve to catch her breath. He could feel he was on the cusp of something and it would not do to end things too soon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hurry! We must seize the remains of Saint Seiros before–gulrk–!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Death Knight tilted his head as the man in white went down with an arrow through his throat, regarding the young man in a Garreg Mach uniform following in after him with a bow in hand. More students arrived, striking at the rest of the intruders, but the boy with the yellow cape seemed important.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I really hope that was one of the bad guys,” Claude muttered to himself, before noticing the Death Knight. “Woah. Hey, Teach, are you doing okay over there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Death Knight tilted his head the other way, thinking. That boy wasn’t one of his master’s vassals. He could certainly afford to kill that one.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine! Ignore the knight, just help Edelgard handle the intruders!” Byleth ordered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I have to,” Claude pointed out as, across the room, Edelgard batted a sword out of the lead mage’s hands before crushing his head against the casket with her axe. “Wait, is that–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sword spun through the air before clattering to the floor by Byleth’s feet. She stared at it for a moment, a strange sense of confusion and familiarity hitting her all at once, before she had to move again as the Death Knight decided to swing his scythe down at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She rolled to her feet, the strange sword in her hand as the knight chuckled, a low, dark sound that reverberated through the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“SO THAT IS IT…EXCELLENT.” The Death Knight let his bloodlust flow into the Scythe of Sariel, filling its blade with murderous intent. The scythe began to gleam just as the sword in his foe’s hand started to glow. Beneath his helm, the Death Knight felt a truly joyous smile begin to spread across his face. “COME! LET US FINISH THIS!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He heard voices, cries from the students, before he swung just as she did. He saw a flash as the blade extended, moving unlike any sword he had seen before. Then he felt his armor split, and a laugh spilled from his lips as he felt blood well at his chest. “YES! YES!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He turned, looking at his greatest foe, who turned to face him just the same. And just like him, there was a wound across her chest. He saw her spit blood from her lips, but she was still alive, still focused on him and him alone. He felt enraptured, his heart racing as blood spilled from his wound. Yet it was too shallow. They weren’t finished yet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop!” he heard his master command, a hint of uncharacteristic fear in her voice, but she need not fear. He had found exactly what he was looking for.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It almost came as an annoyance then when he noticed a second woman sprinting at him with her sword drawn. Any other time, he might have been delighted to see Thunder Catherine joining the fray, yet he only felt disappointment at how the climax of their battle must be postponed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He swung still, forcing her back lest she lose her nose. “Grh–You won’t get away with this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“AS THOUGH I CARE. FAREWELL, ASHEN DRAGON. I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR NEXT BOUT.” And then he was gone as though he had never been.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth just stared at where the knight had been, her body still tense from the fight as she felt…strangely dizzy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Grh…dastard!” Catherine spat, before turning to look at the professor, “Hey, are you–Ah!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She caught the shorter woman as she suddenly slumped, before noticing just how much she was bleeding. “Ah, damn it all! Get a healer over here, now!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And as Marianne and Linhardt, moving faster than most of the students had seen him move before, hurried over to the professor, Claude decided to just…take things in for a moment. Because if he was right, the sword the professor was still holding was exactly what he’d been looking for.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not only that, but it was pretty interesting seeing Edelgard hurry to her professor’s side too, despite not being a healer like Catherine called for…And then, of course, there was that last thing that caught his eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So hey, did that knight guy just leave his horse here?”</span>

  <p>
  <span>Jeritza sighed to himself, then downed another elixir before tightening the bandages around his chest. He often disliked his other side, the monstrosity that hungered within him for blood and death, but never more so than when the damned fool went and caused him trouble after the fact. It was always him who patched up the wounds once the bloodshed was done, because it was not the place of the Death Knight to do any actual maintenance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a knock at the door to his quarters and he felt a frown come to his face. “I am indecent. Do not enter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And yet, the door was opened anyway and he felt a deeper spike of annoyance at the thought that he’d have to kill a witness before he recognized the white hair of his employer. “Lady Edelgard. And Lord Hubert. Hello.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His employer did not look pleased. Jeritza watched as the heir of Vestra closed the door and briefly considered if this was the point at which the young man would execute him. He felt the Death Knight immediately begin to rise at the idea, displeased at the thought of dying outside of combat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What in the world was that?” Edelgard demanded, scowling at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I presume you refer to my actions within the Mausoleum, rather than my poor attempt to get you to leave. As to the latter, I thought it best I not be seen bandaging my chest soon after the Death Knight received a wound across his.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That part is understandable. What I meant is why did you attack the professor? You were supposed to hold back!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was my intention, yes. However, do you recall the time at which Professor Byleth requested she spar with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard pinched the bridge of her nose. “Please don’t tell me my suspicions were correct…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If your suspicions were that the Death Knight desired to fight Professor Byleth again because of the brutality she showed during the spar, then I apologize, but you were entirely correct.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His employer groaned again, placing her face in her hands in a display of exasperation while Hubert regarded Jeritza with a raised eyebrow. “‘Professor Byleth’, is it? Not ‘Professor Eisner’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She is a colleague and an equal on the battlefield. The Death Knight is quite certain she is the one who will finally put an end to our torment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And that means he’s going to go after the professor whenever possible,” Edelgard noted, looking up from her hands, “Meaning you’ve just become an enormous liability, Jeritza.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed,” Jeritza agreed, “I apologize. However, I should be able to keep a firm enough control of him to avoid causing issues while attending to my duties at the Academy. If we meet again on the battlefield though, I can make no promises.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard sighed. “Unfortunately, that is likely unavoidable. I already promised Those Who Slither that you could be used for three missions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am aware. I will still do my utmost to carry out your orders, yet I cannot guarantee the Death Knight will not cause issues of his own volition.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So our circumstances are much the same,” Hubert noted, earning him a frown from his lady, “You know I’m right, your highness. We always knew the Death Knight was an issue. For as useful as Jeritza is, he comes with an unfortunate addition that will always mean he straddles the line between useful and detrimental.” He glanced at Jeritza. “No offense intended, of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have no issue with your words, they are all correct.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard glanced between her two vassals, then sighed again. “Okay, fine, we’ve established there will be problems because of the Death Knight. We can’t avoid that. What we can look at is how to mitigate it, along with what we should do moving forward. Especially given the issue of my…owing Those Who Slither.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then there was another knock at the door and all three of them paused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I am indecent, do not–” Jeritza began before Hubert simply locked the door. “Ah. I should have done that earlier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should have, yes,” Hubert replied, before the knock came again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Hresvelg, Lord Vestra, I know you two are in there,” came the voice on the other side, one that made Hubert frown while Edelgard’s eyes widened in recognition, “Do let me in before I’m forced to report how two students are in the same room as an ‘indecent’ instructor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Hubert slipped a knife from his sleeve as he took the door handle, before pausing when Lady Edelgard shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s one of them,” she explained, before moving past him and opening the door herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Selene smiled cheerfully as she was allowed entrance, stepping inside quite casually before nodding to Edelgard. “Thank you very much for holding the door for me, your highness. Would you mind closing it as well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned but did so as Selene looked around the bedroom. “My, you truly do have quite barren living quarters, Instructor Jeriitza. I would think the heir of House Hrym would liven up his living space at least a little. Wouldn’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have no need of decoration,” Jeritza responded, “Who are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The priestess smiled, then curtsied with her robes. “I am Selene, a faithful member of the Church of Seiros. I come from the Empire originally, though I consider the Kingdom a second home after a lengthy pilgrimage there. I am also wondering just what you were thinking, you stupid bastard, when you completely botched the mission into the Mausoleum.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeritza blinked. It wasn’t the words that caught him off guard so much as the fact that the woman’s tone hadn’t changed in the slightest even as she spoke them. “...Ah. You are a member of Those Who Slither in the Dark then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Great Sages, is that actually what you call us?” Selene asked, glancing at Edelgard, “I’m actually offended. I didn’t think that could happen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Do the words of us ‘lowly beasts’ matter so much to you then?” Edelgard asked in turn, crossing her arms over her chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sticks and stones may break bones, but words wound just as deep, girl. But I’ll save the lessons for your professor to teach, presuming she still lives after this lout decided he’d prefer to carve her up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She is going to live, and we were just discussing that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Horrible news, and excellent, then I don’t have to waste time reiterating the point where he allowed the armor we so generously gifted him to get sliced up. Though did you mention the part where he left his horse behind, yes? You know, the one also outfitted with Agarthan armor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned. “So that’s why you’re involving yourself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You put special armor on a horse?” Hubert asked, prompting Selene to roll her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your ‘Death Knight’ is the one that requested full armor, so obviously we’re not going to half-ass it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened to the Death Horse then?” Jeritza asked, before pausing as everyone stared at him. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you honestly name your steed ‘The Death Horse’?” Hubert asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. He is the horse of the Death Knight, therefore he is the Death Horse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That does make sense,” Edelgard noted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Selene, meanwhile, slapped a hand to her face and groaned something akin to ‘useless animals’.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. So is that all you wish to discuss with us?” Hubert asked the false priestess.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. I would ask that you keep that armor from being studied by the Church, if possible. Aside from that, leash your pet better. I would hate to think he could disrupt our own plans when it comes time to call in our favors.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We still succeeded in our objective,” Edelgard rebutted, annoyed with the sage’s arrogant tone, “The tomb of Seiros was proven to be empty. Even if there was something unexpected inside.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah yes, the Sword of the Creator, which you allowed the Church to so easily reclaim.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert raised an eyebrow. “Oh? So that’s what that sword was.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Selene made a disgusted face. “Don’t pretend ignorance. It would have been a boon if we could have acquired it and now it’s bound to go back under even tighter security.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. Are you certain?” Edelgard asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Certain of what? That the beasts would rather keep their greatest weapon close at hand?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t doubt that, it’s just…the Sword of the Creator lacked a crest stone, yet it reacted in the professor's presence.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Selene paused, then frowned. “That…shouldn’t be possible. It would make sense to keep the stone separate from the relic if they did not wish it to be used, but…No, that thief shouldn’t have any descendants, should he?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what ‘thief’ would that be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, that ‘King of Liberation’, as you call him. The fool would have been little more than a bandit were it not for my people’s aid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked, before her brow furrowed, thoughts racing at the offhand revelation Bias had let slip as though it barely mattered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias scarcely noticed though. “Perhaps we should keep a closer eye on that professor of yours…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Edelgard had a thought. “Isn’t that what Shez is there for?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” Bias raised an eyebrow, then paused, her eyes widening. “...That bitch. How long has she been planning…No. No, never mind. Hresvelg, I’ll…I will contact you later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would prefer any correspondence to her highness go through me first,” Hubert stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine, I’ll talk to you first then, Vestra,” she replied, and Hubert kept his features schooled at the unexpected acquiescence, “I just…need to think about…Could Solon know? He seemed curious, he must have suspicions…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard and Hubert shared a glance, before Edelgard elected to speak. “Bias.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Agarthan paused, then looked towards the princess with a frown. “Try to keep that name off your lips while we’re still in the monastery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very well, Selene. I wanted to ask though if, perhaps, there might be something we could do to aid you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...what? You…You’re offering to help me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am. It sounds as though your faction may be dealing with a splinter group. The one operating under Cleobulus, perhaps?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...How did you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s the only sage unaccounted for in your description of their duties. You mentioned seven, two are deceased, you are one, Solon is another, and Myson and Chilon are accounted for. So that leaves the last one, who sounds as though she may have betrayed your people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Bias just stared at her, her mind visibly racing, before she straightened. “...That depends. The girl, Shez. She infiltrated the ‘Jeralt Mercenaries’. Can you check if they were in the Oghma Mountains five years ago?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Easily,” Hubert assured with a smirk on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Good. Good. Then, if you can do so…I believe I might owe you a favor in turn.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard nodded, hiding any hint of her true feelings as the Agarthan willingly placed herself in their debt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...We’ll speak again soon,” Bias decided, before turning for the door. She paused a moment later though. “Solon has plans for that girl. I may have plans as well. Do not kill her under any circumstance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you insist,” Hubert replied with some amusement, while Edelgard simply nodded in reply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh, and your horse is in the stables,” Bias offered, nodding to Jeritza.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see. So the Death Horse has been imprisoned then…how unfortunate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…I’m not going to follow up on that, goodbye.” And so she left, which let Edelgard sink into Jeritza’s desk chair with a sigh of relief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hubert, we can’t waste this opportunity.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re right, we cannot. Though I would like to know what that opportunity is, your highness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She glanced up at him, no longer bothering to hide her smile. “The opportunity to turn a ‘sage’ against her fellows. Especially with how readily she suspected another of her number.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Assuming she actually does suspect such a thing and wasn’t putting on an act for our benefit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Assuming that, true. But we do have to assume there are some bouts of honesty coming from Those Who Slither, especially when they allow it to slip from their lips without thought.” And what fascinating information she garnered from those small slips. To know the Agarthans considered Nemesis a thief who needed their aid as well as learning that Shez more than likely belonged to the faction under this “Cleobulus” person, who was apparently a woman…There were puzzle pieces there, though she didn't have everything to fit them all together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She would though. Soon enough, she would know all she needed to make her vision a reality. Though, in the midst of all that, a part of her couldn’t help but consider her professor…and just what she might think when Shez’s deceptions were unveiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A part of her…really didn’t want to do that to her professor. But…she wouldn’t look back. She couldn't. Not if she wanted to create a better world.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Preparing for the day felt… difficult. For all her talk of being ready to send people to their death, almost causing the violent demise of her professor showed Edelgard that her heart wasn't as hardened as she hoped. Letting out a sigh as she tied her hair with her ribbons, the young princess walked out of her room, though she paused quite quickly when a small meowing caught her attention.</p><p> </p><p>Glancing down, the princess saw a Hresvelgian Whisker rub up against her legs. With a sad smile, she crouched down to pet the cat. </p><p> </p><p>"My apologies, I seem to have forgotten to get you your treats for today," Edelgard apologized, even as the cat leaned into her touch, purring as they did, "I'll make sure to bring you some later." </p><p> </p><p>The cat let out another mew, before curling up in front of her door. </p><p> </p><p>"I really should come up with a name for you…" Edelgard muttered, wondering what kind of name would honor the cat for ensuring no…pests got into her room. Ah, though she should focus on getting to class first. </p><p> </p><p>…Whiskerton the Great. </p><p> </p><p>No, wait, she shouldn't get distracted. Bidding the cat farewell, Edelgard commenced her walk to the class, then idly noted Hubert slinking up behind her as she went from walking alone to walking together.</p><p> </p><p>Things around the monastery were hectic, as she had assumed. It was to be expected, given that the Tomb of Seiros had not actually contained the corpse of Seiros, but a relic weapon. Perhaps that was why Rhea had ordered for the immediate execution of the Western Church members? It was a foolish decision, of course, to send them to their deaths without even questioning them. Apparently she hadn’t even bothered to hear their last words before putting them to the sword.</p><p> </p><p>Not that it was surprising. The Archbishop had spent far too long stuck in her ways, and in the history of the church, dissenters were almost always put to the blade. Unless it was the Kingdom of course, back when they had rebelled and were given sovereignty after a bloody war. </p><p> </p><p>A part of her idly wondered if, should she succeed, she would be remembered in the same light. A glorious hero who freed the lands from a corrupt evil…</p><p> </p><p>What a foolish notion. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey there, Edelgard. You certainly seem down," Claude greeted, his usual grin on his face. </p><p> </p><p>"I would think that would be obvious," Edelgard responded, “Professor Byleth was nearly killed.”</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, but I didn't expect you to take it so badly. I mean, here I thought we were similar in that regard. Though I suppose you're more naive than I thought." </p><p> </p><p>"Did you require anything besides insulting Lady Edelgard?" Hubert asked, glowering at the house leader. </p><p> </p><p>"I did in fact, no need to worry there Hubert, my man," Claude replied, uncaring of the glare he received. "Just had to ask since you're the one who was fighting against that robber. That was a relic weapon, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"And what if it was?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well I'm just curious is all. I mean, as far as I know, Seiros didn't wield a relic weapon. Not to mention how the sword was the only thing in the coffin. In fact, thinking about what I know of Fodlan’s history, wasn’t it her mortal enemy Nemesis that had a relic weapon that just so happened to be a sword?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you trying to make a point with this history lesson? Or are you truly so enamored with the sound of your own voice?” Hubert taunted, his annoyance obvious.</p><p> </p><p>"Can't it be both? Claude asked. "But if you want me to get to my point, I will. Did Teach tell you what her crest is?" </p><p> </p><p>"Professor Byleth doesn't know what her crest is, so I fail to see how she would tell me," Edelgard answered. </p><p> </p><p>"Is that so? Well I was just curious, might have just been a trick of the light, but from my perspective it looked like she immediately dived at the sword. Said sword also seemed to react to her crest," He looked directly at Edelgard. "And I'm sure an Adrestrian princess like you has to know what crest Nemesis had." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Edelgard's frown deepened. Was it possible that Byleth had the same crest as her? In that case…Was she actually a descendant of the King of Liberation? </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, based on your reaction, you didn't know. Guess our stoic professor is one to keep secrets after all," Claude mused. </p><p> </p><p>"..." No, that wasn't accurate. If Byleth did have that crest, then she likely did not know. Though… was it possible someone else knew? Was that why Rhea was so interested in Byleth…?</p><p> </p><p>"Oh? You look like you’re thinking about something interesting there. Care to share your thoughts with me? You know, in the spirit of inter-house cooperation and all that.”</p><p> </p><p>"I am not one to spread rumors, Claude. Even more so when it comes to the professor. Besides, would it not be better to ask Shez, or Captain Jeralt?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hey come on now, I'm not that callous to try and pry them away from Teach's bedside." </p><p> </p><p>"Then I suppose you'll just have to wait. Now if you'll excuse me, I have class to attend," Edelgard stated, brushing past him. </p><p> </p><p>"I see he continues to be a thorn," Hubert muttered as they entered their class. Unsurprisingly they were the first ones there, as was the usual. It was a bit odd, thinking about how consistent things could be at a time like this. After Edelgard and Hubert’s entrance, it would always be Ferdinand, happily greeting them as he sat nearby. Soon afterwards Petra would show up, usually after a morning jog, with Caspar rushing in after his own training. The professor would show up soon after, going over her lesson plan for the day, as she quietly greeted everyone. </p><p> </p><p>In immediate contrast, Dorothea usually walked in afterwards, cheerily greeting everyone. The last student to show up on time was always Bernadetta, the mousey girl slinking in and trying to go unnoticed. The final two students tended to be a coin flip on who would arrive last; Lindhart with his tendency to oversleep often wandered in a few minutes after lessons began, while Emily just came in whenever she wanted. </p><p> </p><p>The fact that she would show up at all was probably a miracle, really. </p><p> </p><p>Which meant it came as a large surprise that the first one to show up after them was Emily. </p><p> </p><p>"...tch, of course you're here early," Emily muttered, looking away from them. Sitting down at the back of the class, the disguised Agarthan said nothing else. </p><p> </p><p>"...I'm surprised to see you here so early," Edelgard responded, noting Emily restlessly bouncing her leg up and down. </p><p> </p><p>"When I show up is my own business," Emily grunted, a scowl on her face. "Being here is supposed to make me stronger, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"I was unaware that you were actually taking the lessons here seriously." </p><p> </p><p>"Not like I tell you what I do," Emily snarked, before looking away from her. Letting out a sigh, Edelgard turned back to her desk, before pulling out her own textbook to self study. She could only hope their professor would awaken soon. </p><hr /><p>"Until further notice, I shall be acting as professor for the Black Eagles," Jeritza stated, having walked into the classroom the next day. </p><p> </p><p>"..." Edelgard could only find bitter irony at the situation at hand. Her original plan at the start of the year was to get Jeritza as her professor, and to think she would actually get that, albeit temporarily. </p><p> </p><p>"I am unaware of the lessons Professor Byleth had in mind, so for now, we shall head to training grounds for some practice," Jeritza stated, “Pair off as you wish to. I am uninterested in fighting any of you, so do not bother me.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Ferdinand raised his hand. “Er, professor, are you certain this is the best course of action–”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. Go to the training grounds, now.”</p><p> </p><p>"Great, so we have a combat addict in charge now," Dorothea muttered as the students got up. "Could be worse I suppose. If we had Seteth instead, he'd probably just lecture us all day." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, at least this keeps us active," Edelgard responded, which the class did need in the moment given how down the mood was.</p><p> </p><p>"True. Anyways Edie, are you busy after class? I was thinking of visiting the professor." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…My apologies, but I will not have the time to visit the professor for now," Edelgard declined, finding it inappropriate to visit her given her involvement in what happened. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, really? Well, you should make sure to visit her when you have the time," Dorothea suggested with a smile. </p><p> </p><p>"I will. If nothing else, I will make sure to visit when she awakens." </p><p> </p><p>"Hey! Professor Jeritza! Come on, let's spar!" Caspar immediately shouted upon arriving at the training grounds. </p><p> </p><p>"I said I am uninterested in sparring with any of you." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah but I wanna spar with you!" Caspar declared. </p><p> </p><p>"Well at least he's still as lively as ever…" </p><p> </p><p>"He does have the right idea," Ferdinand noted as Caspar continued to bug Jeritza. "That night at the Mausoleum just showed how much further we have to go to match the professor." </p><p> </p><p>Not just the professor really. Even if it was the Death Knight fighting, Edelgard had underestimated the weaponry the Agarthans wielded. If she was pious, she would have said it was a miracle Byleth survived. As it stood, it was thanks to Lindhart and Marianne that she had been stabilized in time for Manuela to take over. She should make sure to thank them when she had the time. </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me, I hope I'm not bothering you." Breaking out of her thoughts, Edelgard glanced over to see Mercedes standing near the entrance to the training grounds, Annette standing behind her. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Did you require something?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not at all, I just wanted to see how you all were doing." Mercedes responded, walking up to Edelgard to watch the training going on. Surprisingly Caspar had managed to convince Jeritza to spar with him, though it was more him deftly blocking Caspar's attacks with one hand. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I mean… we know Professor Byleth is okay, but you know…" Annette trailed off, unsure of what to say. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you for your concern, though at the moment, we are simply waiting for her to recover," Edelgard responded, "And there was no need to skip classes to check on us." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, no we're not skipping class! Professor Hanneman assigned us to free study today because he had something to discuss with Lady Rhea," Annette interjected. </p><p> </p><p>"I also wanted to check if you and the rest of the Eagles were up for some treats,” Mercedes explained, “I was already planning on baking some for Shez, so I wanted to see how much I should make." </p><p> </p><p>"...Well, I would hate to deny your gift," Edelgard allowed.</p><p> </p><p>"Wow! Jeritza, are you okay!?" Caspar suddenly shouted, catching their attention as the students looked over to see the instructor crouching down, grasping his chest, his mask knocked clean off his face. </p><p> </p><p>"It is… an old woun," Jeritza responded, pushing himself up as he moved over to grab his mask. Edelgard heard a small gasp beside her as Mercedes got a good look at the instructor without the mask on. </p><p> </p><p>"Is something wrong?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh… it's okay, just… Professor Jeritza reminds me of someone I knew," Mercedes responded, before muttering something to herself. </p><p> </p><p>Frowning, Edelgard glanced between the two, before noting some…similarities between the two. Though…It couldn't be, could it?</p><hr /><p>Wandering around in a daze, Shez couldn't help the listless feeling she was experiencing. She wanted to stay at Byleth’s side, but after the third day, Manuela had practically kicked her out, saying that staying there wouldn't do her any good. A part of her had wanted to argue, but even she knew better than to start yelling in the infirmary. </p><p> </p><p>Though before she could wander any further, she bumped into someone. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, sorry about that," Shez apologized. </p><p> </p><p>"I-It's okay…" Marianne responded, the bluenette's eyes cast downward. </p><p> </p><p>"Still, I should have been paying attention to where I was walking," Shez noted, giving her a small smile. "Are you heading somewhere?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I was going to see how Professor Byleth was doing." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, right, you helped save her at the Mausoleum, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"I-I didn't really do much," Marianne said, nervously wringing her hands. "L-Lindhart and Professor Manuela did most of the work. Really, I probably made things worse…" </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, I dunno about that. I mean, By was pretty badly hurt and you're good with faith magic, right?" Shez asked with a frown. "I mean, I heard you rushed in right away to help her." </p><p> </p><p>"...I-I didn't want Professor Byleth to die." </p><p> </p><p>"Exactly! So you helped save her!" Shez responded with a grin. "So I don't know who's been saying you made things worse, but point them out to me so I can beat them up." </p><p> </p><p>“H-Huh? U-Um…n-no one…a-actually said that…to me, directly, I mean…” Marianne mumbled, fidgeting a little with her hands, “...I-Is Professor Byleth going to be okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course she is!” Shez declared with a grin, burying down her own worries, “She’s going to be just fine! So just, uh…pray for her! You like praying, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I-I s-suppose that would be something better to pray for…um…I-I’ll make sure to…”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that sounds good, oh, or maybe you can join her class instead?”</p><p> </p><p>“O-oh…I don’t k-know about that…”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, whatever you choose, I’m sure By will appreciate it.. Uh, I should probably get going now though. Have a good one!”</p><p> </p><p>“Y-You too…”</p><p> </p><p>Shez waved the bluenette off before walking along without any idea of where she was going or what she should be doing now. Maybe she should ask her dad for work? His office was right by the infirmary so he’d been checking in on Byleth about once every hour, so maybe if she worked with him, she’d have an excuse to–</p><p> </p><p>“You need something, kid?”</p><p> </p><p>Shez startled, shaken from her thoughts before looking at some woman she didn’t recognize at all. “Oh, no, I’m good.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Is there a reason why you came to the knight’s quarters then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” Shez looked around, then winced as she realized she really was in the place all the knights usually hung out in. “Ah…sorry, no. I was just…I dunno, just kind of walking around. It’s no big deal, uh…uhhh…you person whose name I totally know.”</p><p> </p><p>“This is the first time you’ve spoken to me,” the blue-haired woman wearing black and turquoise noted.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Oh good! Alright, new person then, hi there! This your first time at the monastery?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been here longer than you have. And I’ve been at the monastery since the start of the month.”</p><p> </p><p>“...You were?” Shez didn’t quite glance at Arval, but she did want to double check on that.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…I do think I have seen her around,” Arval answered to her silent query, “Your sister talked to her at least once.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was,” answered the woman to Shez’s verbal query, “Shamir Nevrand, former mercenary and current Knight of Seiros.”</p><p> </p><p>“You were a mercenary??” Shez asked, immediately curious, then paused, “Oh, you’re a knight of Seiros…”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Usually people are more disappointed by the mercenary part than the knight part.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? Being a merc is much cooler though.” Shez tilted her head, still a little curious. “So did you run with any groups I’d know? I worked with a few before getting adopted by my dad–Oh, right, I’m Shez Eisner, by the way! Jeralt the Blade Breaker’s second daughter!”</p><p> </p><p>“I know who you are. You make yourself pretty obvious. As for my time as a merc, that’s in the past." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh, you sure? I mean, I'm not a knight but I think being a merc is better."</p><p> </p><p>"Heh, better not let anyone else hear you. Besides, I owe Lady Rhea for taking me in, and my partner would probably throw a fit if I left."</p><p> </p><p>"Really? They a part of the knights as well?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, you probably met her already. She's Catherine." </p><p> </p><p>"...Not to be rude but my opinion of you has drastically lowered because of your taste in women." </p><p> </p><p>"...I'm gonna ignore that because Catherine told me what happened with her and your sister in the past. Also, I meant we're partners because we were assigned to one another." </p><p> </p><p>"Aaah. Well still, you seem okay so I'm sure you can do better than her."</p><p> </p><p>"Hmph. What about your taste in women?" </p><p> </p><p>"Uh… I guess I don't really have a specific taste in people?" Shez said with a shrug. "I'd probably just say someone strong, since I'd prefer them being a merc alongside me." </p><p> </p><p>"Already planning on returning to the merc life?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, yeah, duh. This place is nice and all, but I prefer being able to travel around. So I guess if I got with someone they'd have to be okay with that as well." </p><p> </p><p>"Strong and likes to travel huh? Such refined taste you have," Shamir said with a smirk. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, it works for me! I’m a gal with simple tastes!” Shez replied, grinning too.</p><p> </p><p>“You know Catherine fits both of those standards.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Okay, now you’re messing with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I might be.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…alright, new standard. Strong, likes to travel, and has never tried to kill me or my sister.” Shez paused, a thought occurring. “Hm…maybe ‘has never tried to kill my sister’. I dunno, I’ve read some stuff where enemies turn to lovers and that sounds kinda nice.”</p><p> </p><p>“Speaking from personal experience, it doesn’t go great.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Okay now I’m really curious. You can’t just say that and not explain!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…maybe. I know you’ve got nothing better to do, but I probably have something I should be taking care of.”</p><p> </p><p>“Aw! But you can’t even name what you have to do!”</p><p> </p><p>“I can probably think of something.”</p><p> </p><p>"Feh, fine, I'm going," Shez said with a pout. Probably best to leave before Catherine came by if this was the knights’ quarters. </p><p> </p><p>"There you are." Blinking as someone called out to her as she left the knights’ quarters, Shez glanced over.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, hey Lysithea, how's it going?" </p><p> </p><p>"I should be asking you that." Lysithea responded. "Though I can do that later. I wanted to know if you were up to train your magic." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, uh, I guess I'm not busy, so sure? Any reason why?" </p><p> </p><p>"Is it not obvious? As your mentor it's my duty to help keep your mind off things. So come on." </p><p> </p><p>"...Heh, thanks Lysithea," Shez said, smiling in response as they two walked together. </p><hr /><p>Jeralt felt tired. A part of him always felt a bit weary, be it because he was worried about his kids, or just because of all the work he had to focus on. Right now however, he just didn't even want to stand up from his desk. </p><p> </p><p>He was an old man, he knew he had lived far longer than most people had. Even so, when it came to his kids, he always hoped they'd end up outliving him. And yet, despite that hope, both of them had nearly died. Shez back during the war, and now Byleth, against some guy dressing up like he was Death himself. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey there, Captain." Gertrude greeted as she walked into his office. Dropping down into an empty chair, she let out a sigh. </p><p> </p><p>"Please tell me Ezra found something." </p><p> </p><p>"Nothing concrete. Hell, all he can find is that there used to be someone going around cutting down bandits and the like, but the armor he has now is new. Aside from it also being pitch black," Gertrude answered as she pulled out her pipe to smoke. "Though, I do have one guess at least." </p><p> </p><p>"Which is?" </p><p> </p><p>"Seems like any sightings of this guy happen either in Empire or Garreg Mach territory. So he's likely not a part of the Western Church," Gertrude surmised. "Though, if he is a mercenary, he's certainly a bloody one." </p><p> </p><p>“Hm. A ‘black knight’ is nothing new. The Empire alone probably has thousands of knights in black armor. A Death Knight though…” He frowned. “Custom work like that has to have some trace to it…good armor is still expensive for anyone who isn’t noble and that was a full suit of some kind of steel. Maybe Umbral…did you check the armor that horse of his had?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, Candace made sure to get it appraised by the smiths. They had to check it on the horse though, the rowdy thing got agitated whenever anyone tried to take it off and the stablemaster didn’t want it to hurt itself. Or anyone else, mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…and?”</p><p> </p><p>Gertrude sighed. “Umbral was a good guess, but it’s not that. No one’s really sure what it is. If we can get it off the horse, we could maybe bring it to a specialist, but that might take some time. Whatever steel it is, it seems solid. Not easy to break off, at least.”</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt frowned. “That sounds about right…apparently that dastard on the horse took every hit without flinching until the kid got that relic sword. That was the only thing that cut into that armor of his…hm. I’d consider asking a noble if we could borrow one of theirs to test it, but that probably won’t go well.”</p><p> </p><p>“They are notoriously stingy with those things.”</p><p> </p><p>"Hm… I could try ordering Catherine to use her sword, but she'd probably take offense to having to use her sword on a horse." </p><p> </p><p>"And I'm pretty sure Candace would try beating you up if you ordered someone to cut down that horse." </p><p> </p><p>"That too." Jeralt sighed. </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, Captain? Can I come in?" Leonie asked, peeking in through the doorway. </p><p> </p><p>"Did you need something Leonie?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not really, I just… wanted to see how you were doing," Leonie answered as she rubbed the back of her head, before trying to give him a bright grin. "I mean, as your apprentice I have to make sure you're okay!" </p><p> </p><p>"Pft, aw, seems the big bad Blade Breaker still has to have kids look out for him," Gertrude teased as she put out her pipe. </p><p> </p><p>"Shut it Gertrude," Jeralt said with a huff. "There's no need to worry about me, Leonie." </p><p> </p><p>“Well, still! It’s good to check, right? Things…Well, I kind of got there late, maybe if I…ah, never mind that! We’re talking about how you’re doing! So…how are you doing?”</p><p> </p><p>"About as well as this old body will let me." Jeralt jokingly responded. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, that's good, but you know…" Leonie made a vague gesture to the room next door. </p><p> </p><p>"...Like I said, don't worry Leonie. I'm stronger than I look and so are my kids. Knowing her, she'll probably be ready to go any day now." </p><p> </p><p>"...Yeah, Byleth is pretty tough. Still got a ways to go before I can match her," Leonie admitted with a sigh. </p><p> </p><p>"Don't sell yourself short Leonie. You've got your own strengths over Byleth and Shez. Besides, you've got your whole life ahead of you to get stronger." </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, man, here I was coming by to try and help you feel better and you end up turning the tables." </p><p> </p><p>"That's the captain for you," Gertrude piped in. "Though it's easy to turn the tables on him." </p><p> </p><p>"Really?" Leonie asked as Gertrude got, wrapping an arm around her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>"...Gertrude what are you-" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, that old lug couldn't even tell his kids about the Pegasus and the Wyverns without having me be the one to talk to them." Gertrude teased as she pulled Leonie out of the room. </p><p> </p><p>"...Really?" Leonie asked again, a bit surprised. "But that's something basic, right?"</p><p> </p><p>"Pft, oh kid you have no idea about how much of a mess the captain can be." Gertrude said with a smirk as Jeralt let out a sigh. </p><p> </p><p>He really needed a drink. </p><hr /><p>As she gently brushed Dorte’s mane, Marianne couldn’t help but glance at the newest addition to the stables. It was hard not to. The armor-clad stallion was an intimidating sight compared to everyone else there; even the stable master avoided him. Aside from leaving some feed for the horse, which he seemed to be ignoring… </p><p> </p><p>“U-Um…I’m sorry, but you really should eat…”</p><p> </p><p>The horse neighed in response</p><p> </p><p>“O-oh, n-no, the stable master wouldn’t poison you.” </p><p> </p><p>He whinnied. </p><p> </p><p>“W-Would you like me to bring you some new feed…u-um, what exactly is your name?</p><p> </p><p>Another whinny. </p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh, The Death Horse…o-okay.” Nodding in response, Marianne walked away to get some fresh feed for him. Moments later, he was eating from the new bucket as Marianne watched him. Which is the sight Shez walked in on as she entered the stable. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hey Marianne, how's it going?”</p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh, hello again S-Shez. I-i’m just feeding The Death Horse.” </p><p> </p><p>“...Eh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Th-That’s what he said his name was.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, you can understand him?”</p><p> </p><p>“Y-Yes?”</p><p> </p><p>“Then can you ask him about his rider??”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh…l-let me try…” Turning around, Marianne began to talk to the horse as Shez looked on, unsure of what the horse was saying. “U-um…He says he’s not a ‘snitch’, so he’s not telling me anything…”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm, well can you tell him something for me?” At her nod, Shez glared at the Death Horse. “Tell him that next time I see his rider, I’m kicking his ass.” </p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh…” She turned to the horse, though it seemed she didn’t need to repeat Shez’s message given the baleful look in The Death Horse’s eyes. The intimidating steed chuffed in a distinctly rude way. “Er…h-he accepts your challenge?”</p><p> </p><p>“Good! …Also, ask him if he knows any other black horses. He looks cool and I kinda want one.”</p><p> </p><p>Marianne was starting to think she shouldn’t have shared her “talent” with Shez.</p><hr /><p>"In time's flow...see the glow of flames ever burning bright…"</p><p> </p><p>Rhea had experienced many things throughout her many years on this land. Be it Anger, Joy or any of the other countless emotions they were ones she had grown accustomed to. Yet, not even she could grow accustomed to fear. </p><p> </p><p>Be it when her mother died, her family went into their deep sleep, or even when war tore apart the lands she wished to keep united, she hated how weak it made her feel. So it was no surprise that fear gripped her heart when she had heard Byleth had almost died. </p><p> </p><p>"On the swift river's drift, broken memories alight…"</p><p> </p><p>It was foolish to think that perhaps she was the vessel in which her mother returned, but Rhea wanted to have faith that she would be. Perhaps that was why she came by every night to sing while she slept. In hopes that it would rouse her from her sleep. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn't help but wonder, would this be like when Seteth and Flayn slept? Would she remain in this state for a thousand years, only to return to see everyone she knew gone…? </p><p> </p><p>Reaching out, she gently caressed Byleth’s face. </p><p> </p><p>"Mother, please return to us… we all need you," Rhea whispered as she began to hum, hoping Sothis had heard her. </p><p> </p><p>No matter how long it took, she would bring back her mother. For the sake of the world. </p>

  <p>Sothis sighed on her throne, frowning down at Byleth, who was simply sitting on the floor because she was kind of tired of standing in this weird void place. “I suppose that mess could have gone worse. You saved your students and that dusty tomb, so, really, that’s a mission accomplished, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yes, I–”</p><p> </p><p>“Except for the part where you got your chest cut open!” And there was the aggravation Byleth was expecting the weird girl that lived in her head to have. "What were you thinking?! You had another charge left!" </p><p> </p><p>"I needed to keep it in case that knight tried to attack any of the students again." </p><p> </p><p>"But he was completely focused on you! He might have tried to rile you up, but he stopped doing that when you started fighting seriously!" </p><p> </p><p>"I couldn't take that chance," Byleth responded, getting Sothis to let out an aggravated sigh. </p><p> </p><p>"You're lucky you had people nearby who could heal you, or things would have been worse. Along with whatever that sword was." </p><p> </p><p>"...Where did that sword come from?" </p><p> </p><p>"Did you not notice? The mage pulled it out of the tomb. Though for a tomb, it seemed rather bereft of a corpse." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth frowned in thought. "I felt like I saw that sword before…" </p><p> </p><p>Sothis made a thoughtful noise. "It is quite the mysterious blade. It reminds me of the one that Catherine uses, though it seems to lack the stone hers has." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…" Shaking her head, she tried to focus on something else. "Was anyone else injured?" </p><p> </p><p>"For someone who doesn't show it, you are remarkably soft-hearted. Aside from some cuts and bruises, no one got injured. Though they were quite lucky none of the other intruders had a weapon like that knight. It reminds me of that power your sister has with how vile it felt." </p><p> </p><p>"...What?" Byleth said, frowning. "You said that before, that the thing Shez does is vile. Why?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…it is odd to describe, as it's more of a feeling but…it feels like my antithesis. Something so completely and utterly different from myself that I can't help but wonder how your sister has it…" Sothis wondered while Byleth couldn't help but feel strange because of what she said. She knew her sister had weird powers, but she couldn't imagine her being anything like that knight. "Well, no matter. Regardless of what happened, you need to recover now. Do make sure to take it easy, it's not just your life on the line." Despite her words, Sothis's tone was rather soft. </p><p> </p><p>"Okay," Byleth said with a nod as the light in the void began to fade. Or, perhaps, as the darkness faded into light…</p><hr /><p>Blinking as she woke up, Byleth could see light coming into the room, letting her see that she was in the infirmary. A light snore caught her attention, and she noticed that Shez and Jeralt were at her side, the two having fallen asleep in some chairs. Sitting up, Byleth couldn't help but hiss in pain as she clutched her chest. She could feel bandages wrapped tight around it under the patient’s gown she was wearing.</p><p> </p><p>"Hrng?" Stirring awake, Shez rubbed her eyes as she reacted to the noise. "What's going–By! You're awake!" And Shez immediately tried to hug her, only to flinch back as Byleth let out a pained grunt. "S-Sorry."</p><p> </p><p>"It's okay, it just hurts more than I thought I did." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course it does! You almost got cut in half!" Shez shouted, which seemed to get Jeralt to stir awake at the loud noise. "What were you thinking!?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I wanted to make sure my students were safe. The knight kept targeting me, so I had to fight him so he didn't attack anyone else." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, so you can be reckless but I can't?" Shez asked, getting Byleth to frown. </p><p> </p><p>"I wasn't being reckless. I was fighting alone because the knight would have killed any of the students in one hit." </p><p> </p><p>"Alright, no arguing while one of you is injured," Jeralt said, having finally come to. "Now, were you being serious about that, kid?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Emily tried to attack the knight from his blindspot while Edelgard tried to cover me. It only took him one attack," Byleth answered, making a pit drop in Shez’s stomach. "Whoever he was, he was dangerous, and I just had to last as long as I could before help could arrive." </p><p> </p><p>"...Fine," Shez said, frowning as she sat back down. "I don't like it, but I get it." </p><p> </p><p>"Either way, it seems like you're not going to be active for a bit,” Jeralt added, “Whatever weapon that knight was using wasn't normal. The healing spells your students used seemed to barely have an effect on the wound and the church’s doctors didn’t do much better, so it isn't properly healed yet. And I have a feeling Professor Manuela is really gonna let you have it if you let your wound open up."</p><p> </p><p>"...Hm." Frowning, Byleth laid back down. "What about classes?" </p><p> </p><p>"Don't think those are important right now," Shez muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"I think Rhea already figured something out with that, so you'll probably hear about it later." Almost as if he called her, Rhea appeared, walking in with a concerned look on her face. </p><p> </p><p>"I heard you three talking from down the hall. I hope you don't mind me intruding." Byleth stayed silent, unable to meet the Archbishop’s gaze and unable to deal with the concern she showed. </p><p> </p><p>"We were just talking about you, so I don't think so,” Jeralt replied, “Byleth here was just wondering what exactly would happen to her class while she recovered?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…" Frowning as she observed the bandaged professor, Rhea spoke. "For now, Jeritza will be instructing your class until you recover. Furthermore, depending on the state you are in, your class may not receive a mission this month." </p><p> </p><p>"...Well, at least some of them will be happy with that," Byleth muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"...There is one last thing, something Hanneman informed me of. It seems he has discovered what your crest is," Rhea said, a smile on her face. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, really?" Shez asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, he was able to realize it after you used the Sword of the Creator. It seems you hold the Crest of Flames, a crest which was thought to have been lost to history," Rhea explained, getting Byleth to frown. </p><p> </p><p>"The crest of the tyrant?" Which in turn made Rhea frown. </p><p> </p><p>"The crest itself is not a symbol of tyranny, it was a blessing of the goddess that Nemesis abused. A blessing that I hope that you use not only for your students, but for all of Fodlan." A smile reappeared on her face. "As such, I wish to entrust upon you the Sword of the Creator." </p><p> </p><p>"What?" </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me, Lady Rhea, not to dismiss such an honor, but isn't that sword a holy relic of the church?" Jeralt questioned, looking skeptical. </p><p> </p><p>"It is, but if this truly is a blessing by the goddess, then it is not one I can ignore. Did it not also save your daughter when she needed it?" </p><p> </p><p>"That’s…that is true…" </p><p> </p><p>"Though I will admit, this must be much to hear so soon after waking, so I shall not force the responsibility upon you, and will wait to hear your decision for when you have recovered," Rhea said with a gentle smile, as though there wasn’t any pressure for Byleth to accept anyway.. </p><p> </p><p>Still, she didn’t really have a decent reason to turn down the sword…so she nodded in return "Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you. Now, I do believe your sister has classes she must attend, and Jeralt has his own duties to perform, if I'm not mistaken." </p><p> </p><p>"Pretty sure missing one day won't matter…" Shez muttered.</p><p> </p><p>"You should go to class, Shez,” Byleth encouraged, “I'll be here when you're done." </p><p> </p><p>"...Fine, I'll bring you food later." </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez paused at Byleth’s response, then gave her a little grin. “Hey…make sure to take it easy, okay? You really worried me there.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will. Promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez nodded to her sister before heading out, leaving Jeralt to sigh and push himself up from his chair. “Right, I guess I should go too. You coming with, Lady Rhea?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Oh, well…I did wish to speak with Byleth perhaps a bit more.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth felt herself immediately tense at that thought, prompting a glance from Jeralt, before he looked back at Rhea. “Then I’ll stick around. Better we leave together, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“That is not necessary, Jeralt. I can find my way through the monastery easily enough. I have lived here for some time, after all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, but you were also the target of an assassination attempt pretty recently. Besides, you can always visit the kid later, when she’s feeling more up to it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea…pouted, which was not a look Byleth ever expected to see on her face. “Those matters were handled. I sincerely doubt there is a threat to my safety here and now. Though, I suppose if you insist.” She glanced at Byleth with a soft smile. “Take care, child. Rest well.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Sure. Thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>And with that, Byleth was alone, which let her lay back with a faint sigh. Her chest still ached, though it was duller…then a thought occurred.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Sothis.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? What is it? Did you really need to call upon me right as I was about to go back to sleep?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth ignored the girl’s annoyance. “Rhea said I wouldn’t get assigned a mission this month.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes? And?”</p><p> </p><p>“The Rite of Rebirth was on the twenty-sixth. There were still a few days until the end of the month. Did I sleep for a week?”</p><p> </p><p>Sothis paused. “...Hm. Perhaps. If so, neither your father nor your sister thought to mention it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right…” It probably wasn’t a big deal then.</p><hr /><p>Apparently being unconscious for a week was a much bigger deal than Byleth expected because she was pretty sure everyone in the school decided to come in to check on her.</p><p> </p><p>Starting off, strangely enough, with Seteth and Flayn. Well, not that strangely in Flayn’s case, but a little strangely in Seteth’s.</p><p> </p><p>“I just wanted to confirm that it was true Lady Rhea decided to give you the Sword of the Creator.” Oh, that explained it.</p><p> </p><p>“Mnh, brother! Be nicer! Professor Byleth was injured protecting the church!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, well…” Seteth cleared his throat. “Good work there. Do make sure to get your rest. You slept quite strongly for…Well, never mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph.” Flayn huffed, before leaning towards Byleth and pretending to whisper to her, though her voice was loud enough to carry anyway. “Do not mind my brother, he was actually quite worried about you and made sure to visit every day.”</p><p> </p><p>“I only visited because I was chaperoning you,” Seteth complained, before glancing at a nearby vase. “Ah, the flowers by your bedside need to be watered again, let me just handle that.”</p><p> </p><p>And he promptly did, all while ignoring the smug smirk Flayn was sending his way. </p><p> </p><p>After the green-haired siblings came some more familiar faces from the Knights of Seiros, consisting of Catherine, Alois, and Shamir. Well, Shamir wasn’t especially familiar to Byleth, she was pretty sure they’d only talked once, but she could recognize the woman.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey there, professor,” Catherine greeted, “How’s the bed rest going?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Good? I don’t think you can be bad at bed rest.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes you can,” Shamir contradicted, “Just look at Catherine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I can sit still! Sometimes! When I need to!”</p><p> </p><p>“See?”</p><p> </p><p>“Haha! Ah, it does my heart good to see my colleagues joke around so readily,” Alois said with a smile, “Just as it does me even better to see you awake, professor! You gave Captain Jeralt quite the scare there.”</p><p> </p><p>“I did? He didn’t mention that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sure, he was just the biggest worrywart the entire time you were out! I tried to tell him to relax and I’m pretty sure he nearly punched me!”</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t you try to make a joke about it?” Shamir pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, he did,” Catherine said, before frowning in thought, “What was it? Something about…’come now, captain, you should get some rest! Unless you think your daughter’s getting enough for both of you!’”</p><p> </p><p>Alois sighed. “I will admit, that may have been a poor attempt at lightening the mood. Though, you know what they say, laughter is the best medicine! Then again, I feel if I told you one right now, you’d be laughing in <em> stitches </em>!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth stared at Alois, then glanced down at her own chest. “Did…Did Manuela have to stitch me up?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, she did. It was really bad,” Shamir stated.</p><p> </p><p>“...Hm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you might want to work on your comedic timing, Alois,” Catherine suggested, frowning at her fellow knight.</p><p> </p><p>“Thyme-ing? But I’m not cooking!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Catherine, at that point, just decided to grab Alois by the back of his armor and drag him out of the room. “See you later, professor! Take it easy!”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yeah, okay,” Byleth replied while giving the blonde knight a little wave, feeling kind of weird to see Catherine be so friendly with her. Then again, Catherine did help her twice, and…was being pretty nice in general. And she didn’t…really feel that angry at the sight of her anymore? So…huh.</p><p> </p><p>Then she noticed Shamir was still there. “...Hi?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey. Don’t mind me, I just wanted to see what everyone was talking about.”</p><p> </p><p>“...People are talking about me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure. Not everyday someone can wield that fancy super sword. That, and I’ve heard a few things about you, like how you and Catherine sparred, how you two later took down Lonato together, and a few other things. You seem popular around here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Shamir seemed faintly amused by that. “Alright, see you around. Catherine seems to like you, so that makes you okay in my book.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked at that, then sank back in bed as Shamir left. The idea that Catherine actually liked her was…confusing. But…that didn’t sound too bad either. Maybe she really should do something nice for her…later though, she was kind of sleepy.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, she didn’t get much sleep when her next visitor decided to announce himself. “Professor! I heard you were awake and I–”</p><p> </p><p>“Ferdie, please, this is still an infirmary,” Dorothea chided Ferdinand as the two of them entered. Which was kind of interesting, so Byleth sat up to look over at the unusual pair.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, see? The professor is awake! No need to worry!”</p><p> </p><p>“You still shouldn’t shout while coming in to check on the sick and injured.” Dorothea’s frown at Ferdinand turned into a smile as she looked towards Byleth. “Hello professor. How are you doing?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged. “Injured. I apparently have stitches.” She ignored how that made her students grimace in favor of tilting her head in mild curiosity. “I’m surprised to see you two together.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is it really so unusual? Why, I think the two of us make for a truly effective pair together!”</p><p> </p><p>“...I just wanted to keep Ferdie from disturbing you when he came to visit,” Dorothea bluntly stated, which seemed to take some of the wind out of Ferdinand’s sails before he rallied.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, as some of your best students, we felt it only proper to come visit you right away! We would have all visited, but Dorothea said it would be improper for everyone to visit at the same time." </p><p> </p><p>"That's because she needs to take it easy, and she can't do that if everyone is crowding around her," Dorothea said with a frown. "Even the students from the other classes wanted to visit, though I'm not surprised. I mean, between you and professor Jeritza you win everytime." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Professor Jeritza certainly has a very… hands off approach to teaching. I don't think we've done much else besides sparring." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, should I start teaching again?" Byleth asked.</p><p> </p><p>"No no professor, you stay in bed, we'll make sure to keep up our studies in the meantime,” Dorothea reassured, “Though, if I can make a request, I will ask you to put a bit more focus on faith magic when you get back. I figured it might be handy to have another healer on the team, you know? Especially with how Lin can be." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, speaking of, I was wondering if I could ask for some horse combat lessons?” Ferdinand requested, “I myself am already quite adept at horse riding, but I'm not used to battling on top of a horse." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth nodded, a little glad to hear her students were exploring new things. "I'll see what I can do." </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, thank you professor,” Dorothea said with a smile, “Don't worry, I'll make sure to patch you up if you ever get hurt again!" </p><p> </p><p>"And though I may be Lady Edelgard’s shield, I promise to rush to your aid if you need it!" Ferdinand assured.</p><p> </p><p>“...Thank you.” Byleth said with a small smile of her own as the two left, before Caspar and Bernadetta walked in. Were they waiting outside? </p><p> </p><p>“Hey there Professor! Are you feeling better?” Caspar asked, his concern evident despite how boisterous he still was. </p><p> </p><p>“Doing better,” Byleth replied, before glancing at Bernie who seemed to shrink away. “Are you two okay?” </p><p> </p><p>“Of course we are! And don’t worry, we’ll make sure to get stronger so you won't have to do all the tough fighting on your own next time! Isn’t that right, Bernadetta?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I-I’m s-sorry I w-wasn’t able to help, p-professor! Y-You s-said not to d-draw his attention, b-but I still tr-!” </p><p> </p><p>“Bernadetta, you were very brave that night. Maybe we should try getting you a new bow?” Byleth suggested, doing her best to calm Bernie. It was hard to tell if it worked, considering Bernadetta just ducked her head and started mumbling.</p><p> </p><p>“Heh, isn’t that great Bernadetta? That knight won’t know what hit him once we get new gear and start training!” Caspar, meanwhile, was fully into the idea. “Oh, speaking of, Professor, do you mind asking those merc friends of yours if I can train with them? With how strong you are, I’m sure I can learn a thing or two from your buddies!”</p><p> </p><p>"I’ll make sure to ask them. Take care, okay?” </p><p> </p><p>“Sure thing, Professor!” </p><p> </p><p>“...Th-Thank you, professor.” And as they left, Linhardt and Petra came in, confirming Byleth’s thought that her students really were just waiting outside to come in in pairs of two.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor, have you been recovered well?” Petra asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe a bit more sleep will do her well,” Lin said, walking over and handing a book to Byleth. “Here, to read while you’re cooped up.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, thank you.” Byleth turned it over, feeling some curiosity pique when she saw it was titled “The History of Adrestia”.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t mention it, It’s just a book I had lying around,” Linhardt said as he yawned. "Though I do hope you recover quickly. I can barely take a nap with how loud everyone else is being." </p><p> </p><p>"Linhardt is meaning well by his words, he has been quite restless since that night," Petra said with a smile. </p><p> </p><p>"I just think it would be a shame if the professor died before I could study her crest." Linhardt replied. “It’s not everyday a crest long thought missing suddenly reappears, not to mention her being able to wield a relic weapon sounds quite fascinating.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, I’m not sure how well you can study me while I’m here, but I’ll do my best to help.” </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, good. Thank you, professor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Be resting well, professor!” Petra encouraged, “I am hoping you will be recovering quickly!”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Petra,” Byleth replied, before a thought occurred, “Are you having any trouble with Jeritza’s training?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, um…No, I am not having trouble with his training. He has not been doing much of teaching, but it is easy to have understanding of combat training. Though it is strange it is all we are doing."</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Do you want to come by after class and have some lessons here?"</p><p> </p><p>Petra blinked. “Oh, that would be most helpful! Ah, but you are meant to be resting, professor.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged. “I’m not doing anything else. Besides, I like being useful.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Um, may I be asking what that is meaning then? You are having many uses?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I guess? I meant that I enjoy being helpful though.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I have understanding!”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, if Petra is getting some tutoring, then you wouldn’t mind if I came along too,” Linhardt suggested, “You two can do whatever you want to do while I study the professor…or get some sleep. The beds here do look comfy…”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine with that,” Byleth agreed. It was fine if Lin decided to take naps after class, though she wasn’t completely sure if Manuela would be happy with his presence. She could ask her later though, after saying goodbye to her two most recent visitors.</p><p> </p><p>And then Byleth waited. She continued to sit up, looking towards the door to the infirmary. She waited some more. Then it finally opened and she felt a sudden, happy feeling…that turned strangely disappointed when she saw who actually came in.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey there, Teach!” Claude greeted, raising a hand with his usual grin, “How’s it going?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hi Claude. It’s going well enough.” Byleth craned her head. “Is anyone else with you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Heh, sorry to disappoint, but it’s just me for now. Of course, I didn’t mention to anyone that I was visiting, so don’t feel too bad. I’m pretty sure Hilda’s already planning to put a little something together to help you feel better. Lorenz might say he’s doing the same, but I’m sure he’s just looking to show off how magnanimous he can be.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“So who were you expecting to be with me? Leonie? Marianne?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused. It would make sense for those two to visit. It wasn’t who she was expecting though. “It’s fine. How are you doing? You weren’t hurt during the fight, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no, I’m fine. I came in at the end there. I wasn’t even really leading the cavalry, just managed to show up on time to see you go up against that freaky skull knight. Or ‘Death Knight’, as he’s apparently called.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Death Knight. That makes sense.” He was probably the deadliest foe Byleth had ever fought before. “What have you heard about him?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey now, I’m just starting to look into the guy, you can’t expect much yet,” Claude complained, though he was still grinning, “I can tell you there are some bad rumors about him though. A monstrous figure that rides people down in the night and leaves them in bloodied chunks. Not the kind of guy you want to go up against unprepared.”</p><p> </p><p>Which Byleth had been. She was getting too complacent. She was too used to mercenary work and it had been a long time since anything actually challenged her in that field. She needed to be ready next time…Hm. Maybe she should train her students in multiple weapons?</p><p> </p><p>“Coin for your thoughts, Teach?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused, then glanced at Claude. “...Just that I need to be better prepared for next time.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can understand that. I imagine that fancy new sword of yours might come in handy then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yeah, the Sword of the Creator…” Byleth frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Why the long face, Teach?”</p><p> </p><p>“...It’s nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>“You sure? C’mon, it’s just me here, and I swear I won’t go sharing anything juicy you might decide to tell me.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not really ‘juicy’. It’s…The Sword of the Creator was Nemesis’s sword, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Claude nodded, a little slowly. “That is what I’ve heard, yup.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I have Nemesis’s crest. The Crest of Flames. What does that mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, either that’s the world’s biggest coincidence…or there’s a connection.” Claude regarded the professor, trying to hide the fascination in his eyes. “Do you think you might be related to him?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I don’t see how I could be.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well he was a king, right? The King of Liberation. He probably had some descendants, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Something about that didn’t sound right. Byleth wasn’t sure what it was, but it just didn’t. “I don’t…think so. I don’t know, but I’m not sure if that’s it…”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…your dad has a crest, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, a Crest of Seiros.”</p><p> </p><p>“Interesting…so if it didn’t come from his side, well…” His grin widened as a thought occurred. “What about your mother?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I never knew my mother. She died.”</p><p> </p><p>That made his grin falter. “Oh. Uh, sorry about that.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine, you didn't know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Still, you have my condolences. Though, uh…do you know anything about her? I’m not trying to push, I’m just curious.” He was definitely pushing the subject, but when would he get a chance to satisfy his curiosity like this?</p><p> </p><p>“...Hm. I know she lived here,” Byleth considered, a frown coming to her face as she thought. If her mother did live here, then there should be some information about her here, right? That would make sense…</p><p> </p><p>“She did, huh?” And that was something Claude was absolutely fascinated to hear. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately for him though, that was the point that Manuela opened up the infirmary door. “Hm? Claude, what are you doing here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hey Professor Manuela. I just decided to visit Teach, see how she was doing, that kind of stuff,” Claude explained, not showing the slight disappointment he felt at having his investigation interrupted. He wasn’t expecting Manuela to start grinning though.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh really? You just came to visit then? It wasn’t so you could ask the professor for her blessing?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked. “My blessing?”</p><p> </p><p>“To court your little sister, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Claude felt himself stiffen on reflex at the sudden focus Byleth fixed him with, her eyes locking on with an intense interest.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not really–We’re just friends, professor,” he tried to explain.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I don’t know about that,” Manuela continued, heedless of how she was signing Claude’s death warrant based on the look Byleth was giving him, “Two students from separate houses, hanging out like you two do? And let’s not forget how she gave you that hug for saving her sister.”</p><p> </p><p>“I really didn’t do anything, I just showed up–Teach, seriously, that’s not–” Was he seriously losing his composure here?? “...I should go.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth watched as the Golden Deer’s leader hurried from the room, then tilted her head, considering things. “Hm…You were making fun of him, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Manuela grinned. “Just a bit. It’s fun to tease, don’t you think?”</p><p> </p><p>“It is.” And Byleth felt a rare grin come to her own face. “Especially when Shez has been needling me about my romantic life for years now.”</p><p> </p><p>"Well in that case you best tease her about it as well, from what I've heard your sister has been hanging around quite often with many students, so you'll have plenty of options to take~" </p><p> </p><p>"I'll keep that in mind." Byleth said, already ready to do so. </p><p> </p><p>"Speaking of, what about you professor, has anyone caught your eye~?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Ah, it seems my wounds are acting up, I should probably sleep." Byleth said in a deadpan as she laid down, closing her eyes to pretend she was asleep.</p><p> </p><p>Manuela let out an amused huff as she sat down at her desk. "Fine fine, just make sure to tell me if your wounds actually do start hurting," she said as Byleth settled in for her recovery time.</p><hr /><p>Byleth’s time spent at the infirmary went by faster than expected, even if, aside from some light exercise and such, she wasn't allowed out of the bed. It was still nice having company though, and there wasn't much time outside of nighttime when she was alone. </p><p> </p><p>Ezra came by to play chess with her, Victor and Candace wanted to play poker with her, and also tried to sneak her some booze which they said would help. Sadly for them, Gertrude found out what they were doing so they got in trouble, while the healer in question helped Manuela out with check-ups and such since she was the one who helped take care of Byleth as a mercenary. </p><p> </p><p>Students from other classes would also come by to see how she was doing. Apparently Ingrid wanted to make sure she was fine since Byleth had saved her from that arrow back on the Magdred mission and, as the heir of House Galatea, it was upon her honor to pay her back. Ashe brought her a book to read, while Annette and Mercedes made her some treats, though Manuela stopped her from eating them all right away. Dedue was also nice enough to send some flowers, even if Dimitri was the one to actually deliver them. </p><p> </p><p>The Golden Deer, meanwhile, were also happy to show their concern, as it seemed Hilda and Lorenz did in fact plan a surprise for her, though according to Leonie it was mainly Hilda getting Lorenz, Ignatz, and Raphael to prepare everything. Even so, it was nice seeing them come in with flowers for her, as well as a few get-well gifts. Though Lysithea said she was only there to make sure she was actually well, since, according to her, trying to teach Shez while her sister was injured seemed to be impossible. </p><p> </p><p>Her students also made sure to visit every day, whether to just check up on her or to tell her how everything was going. Bernadetta thankfully seemed to be doing okay even if she was terrified of Jeritza, while Lindhart complained about not being able to nap as often now during lessons. Caspar, meanwhile, was more than happy to tell her all about the spars he had against Victor, which he seemed to be losing in, not that it stopped the young boy from being enthusiastic. </p><p> </p><p>Though, as nice as it was to see everyone visit… </p><p> </p><p>"-And then he has the nerve to say I'm squawking at him! Honestly, the nerve of that Felix." Coming out of her thoughts, Byleth turned to look at Dorothea, who had been talking about her day. "Can you believe he actually said that?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Ah, yeah, he definitely did." Byleth responded, getting Dorothea to pout. </p><p> </p><p>"Lost in your thoughts, professor?" </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, just…have Edelgard and Hubert been busy? I'm not surprised Emily hasn't visited, but I thought they'd at least drop by." </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, they haven't visited?" It seemed Dorothea was also surprised at that info. "I know Edie said she wouldn't have the time to visit when you first woke up, but she said she'd visit you when she could…" </p><p> </p><p>"Is she okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"She better hope she isn't, because I'm going to go drag her here right now." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, I'm sure she has her reasons." Even if Byleth was disappointed she didn't come visit…</p><p> </p><p>"And what reasons could there be?" Dorothea asked, frowning before she thought for a moment. "Oh… I wonder if it's because you got injured. With how Edie is, I wouldn't be surprised if she blames herself for not being able to help you in the fight…" </p><p> </p><p>"I was the one who told her not to get involved, she shouldn't be blaming herself." </p><p> </p><p>"I know, but you know how Edie can be, professor. I mean, it makes the most sense, she was genuinely the most worried, and was even the one to carry you up here once Manuela said to." </p><p> </p><p>"She did?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yup! Our poor Edie has trouble showing it, but she does care, albeit in her own way." </p><p> </p><p>"I see… thank you, Dorothea." </p><p> </p><p>"No need to thank me, I still need to drag her here first. After all, she's not going to make any progress if she doesn't show up, you know?" </p><p> </p><p>"...right." Progress on what? "Still, thank you Dorothea. I'm glad you're in my class." </p><p> </p><p>"Think nothing of it. But if you really want to thank me, you can try introducing me to someone nice." </p><p> </p><p>"Still haven't found someone?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not yet at least, but I still have plenty of time to try. I'm sure I can find someone decent by the end of the year." </p><p> </p><p>"You deserve someone better than decent. For what it's worth, I think anyone would be lucky to be with you, and if they can't see that, then it's on them." </p><p> </p><p>"How kind of you professor, but you really should be saving words like that for someone else. Unless you want to be the one to take care of me in my old age, hm~?" Dorothea asked, obviously teasing. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want me to?" Byleth asked, not catching onto that, which caught Dorothea off guard. </p><p> </p><p>"I wasn't–I was just teasing, Professor." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, okay. I wouldn’t mind though. I’m not that rich, but I could work hard to keep you happy.”</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea blinked at that, her face turning a little red at how sincere her professor sounded. “A-Ah, well, I, um–”</p><p> </p><p>“Um, professor?” </p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused, then glanced over at a familiar voice. “Are you looking for me, Marianne? Manuela’s out for the moment.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, y-yes, I was looking for you–O-Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize someone was already here,” Marianne apologized as she noticed Dorothea, “S-Sorry, I-I’ll come back later–”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no need to! I, ah, was planning to go get Edie anyways! So you two can have your talk just fine, don’t mind me!”</p><p> </p><p>“Bye Dorothea,” Byleth said, waving to her student as she hurried away, giving Byleth and Marianne some privacy. That was nice of her. “What did you need, Marianne?”</p><p> </p><p>“...U-Um, w-well…I don’t really want to bother you while you’re resting…” she mumbled, fidgeting with her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not bothering me. I’m not doing anything right now and I’m always happy to talk to you.”</p><p> </p><p>She smiled faintly at that, before shaking her head. “S-Sorry, that…I shouldn’t be so happy to hear that…u-um, b-but…P-Professor, i-if it’s not too much trouble…c-could I join your class?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sure,” Byleth agreed.</p><p> </p><p>Marianne seemed surprised by how little hesitation the professor answered her with. “O-Oh, w-well…th-thank you. I look forward to attending your classes then.”</p><p> </p><p>“I look forward to having you. Though it might be a little while before I’m cleared to teach classes again."</p><p> </p><p>“Th-That is fine. Um…I-I s-suppose I should t-try to get to know my new classmates…” she mumbled, a little smile coming to her tired face.</p><p> </p><p>“You should.” Byleth tilted her head, considering which students would be best for Marianne to talk to. “...Hm. It might be good to pair you and Bernadetta up for a bit…”</p><p> </p><p>“...P-Professor?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just thinking. You and her are similar, so I'd think you’d get along. And with how soft spoken you both are, I don’t think you’d scare one another.” Byleth explained. “I want to make sure you’re comfortable in my class, so having a friend in it would be nice, right?” </p><p> </p><p>“...T-that it w-would Professor. T-thank you.” </p><p> </p><p>“No need to thank me… hm, maybe you can try talking with Dorothea first? She’s really nice, and I know she wants to learn some faith magic.”</p><p> </p><p>“O-oh, I-I would never p-presume to know enough to t-teach anyone.” </p><p> </p><p>“Just think of it as helping each other out.” Byleth said as she looked up at Marianne. “Dorothea will definitely appreciate you helping her, and she’ll help you out when you need it. That’s what friends do.” </p><p> </p><p>“...D-do you really think they’ll want me as a friend?” </p><p> </p><p>“Of course, you’re a very kind girl Marianne. We’ll be happy to be your friends.” </p><p> </p><p>“Y-You don’t think of me as a nuisance?”</p><p> </p><p>“I would never,” Byleth stated, being completely sincere even as Marianne wouldn’t meet her gaze. </p><p> </p><p>“...” For a brief moment, Byleth thought she saw tears well up in her eyes before she rubbed them away. “A-Argo and Dorte both miss you, I-I’m sure they’d be happy to see you when you can.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll visit them as soon as I can, maybe we can introduce them to your new friends after you properly join my class.” </p><p> </p><p>“...I-I’m looking forward to it, Professor.”</p><p> </p><p>The two of them chatted a little more after that, about how Marianne’s classes were going and what she was doing in her free time, before Byleth’s newest student finally took her leave. And then it was just back to laying down and resting for the professor. She considered reading one of her books, but…eh. She could take it easy for now.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, right as she thought that, the door opened again. Though no one entered.</p><p> </p><p>“Go on, Edie! The professor was asking to see you!”</p><p> </p><p>“Dorothea, you don’t need to push me! I was going to visit on my own time, you don’t need to–”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth sat up, maybe a little too fast from the sudden flash of pain that went through her. Still, she was up in time for Edelgard to see her as she came in. Dorothea was behind her, as was Hubert, which was also nice to see, though Byleth was more focused on her house leader, who did indeed look guilty for a moment before she schooled her features.</p><p> </p><p>“...Hello professor. How are you doing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Edelgard.” Byleth smiled. “I’m doing better.”</p>

  <span>"And that's it for today's lessons! Do try to finish the worksheet by tomorrow morning," Manuela said as class came to an end, "And Raphael, if you need assistance, please make sure to ask someone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure thing, professor!" Raphael responded as he got up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the back of the room, Marianne tried to silently collect her supplies so she could step out right away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, Mari!" Flinching a bit at the loud noise, she looked over to see Hilda approaching. "Did you actually transfer over to the Black Eagles?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A-Ah, yes. S-Sorry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to apologize," Hilda said, even as she pouted, "But if you're going to, why don't we get some tea later?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"U-Um, how about tomorrow?" Marianne suggested, which seemed to surprise Hilda. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? Looking forward to it!" The bubbly pink-haired girl said, smiling as she walked away with a hop to her step. Marianne meanwhile let out a sigh of relief. That wasn't that bad, she didn't say no at least. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm~? Going to have tea with Hilda huh?" Once again, Marianne flinched, backing away from Dorothea as the songstress leaned in close. "Ah, sorry, didn't mean to scare you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"N-No, i-it’s my fault, I apologize." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You really don't need to, I just wanted to check up on you. Professor Byleth said you'll be transferring over?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Y-Yes. D-Did you need something?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not really, just wanted to let you know if you needed anything, feel free to ask~," Dorothea said with a wink, "The professor wanted me to help make sure you fit in well with everyone else. Whenever you're ready, that is." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...M-Maybe some other time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, whenever you want~!" Dorothea replied with a wide smile, before heading off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Okay, that went okay. Maybe being in this new class would be okay? …Should she introduce herself to her new house leader? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taking a deep breath, Marianne made her way to Edelgard, who was currently talking with Hubert. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"U-Uh." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Yes?" And both their sharp gazes turned to her, making her immediately regret her decision. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you require something?" Hubert asked with his usual tone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"N-No, sorry for bothering you," Marianne responded, her gaze downward as she walked away. That was stupid of her. Why did she think she could just go up to someone and talk to them like that?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe she should have just stayed in the Golden Deer. Professor Byleth was so nice to her but… if she learned the truth of her crest… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, you!" Flinching once again, this time from a much harsher sounding voice, Marianne turned to see a scholar of some sorts approaching her. "You're Marianne Edmund, are you not?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Y-Yes, I am Marianne von Edmund. Who are you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm a crest scholar, and I've been searching for you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Y-You have?" Marianne asked, taking a step back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I knew about your father," The scholar said, making Marianne stiffen, "So I wanted to meet you. You have the same crest-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't have a crest!" Marianne shouted, panic filling her as she realized her secret might get exposed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nonsense, your adoptive father paid a hefty sum so you wouldn't be examined, correct? He obviously wants to keep your crest a secret, so you must-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"N-No, you're wrong. I don't have a crest at all," she denied again, feeling her breath quicken. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Stop lying, I know you have the crest of-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me, why are you bothering my classmate?" A sharp voice cut in, getting both of their attention as they turned to see Edelgard approaching.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, your highness. It is nothing you need to worry about. I'm simply trying to conduct some crest research." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so? From where I'm standing you're harassing someone," Edelgard stated as she moved between the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Harassing? I would never do such a thing! It is my duty as a crest scholar to study crests, and surely you must understand the importance of studying the Crest of Maurice!" Marianne felt terror grip her heart as he announced her crest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You're from the empire are you not?" Edelgard asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why yes, have you heard of me?" the scholar asked, sounding pleased. "Or do you simply wish to make sure any findings get attributed to the Em-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll give you one chance then. Leave this girl alone or you shall be exiled from the Empire." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"E-Excuse me!?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I shall not repeat myself. As the future Emperor it is within my power to do so." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why you-" Scowling the crest scholar left, not wanting to see if she was bluffing. As he left, Marianne felt her breath quicken as Edelgard turned to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I-I don't-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What did you wish to speak about earlier?" Edelgard asked, surprising Marianne. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...D-Did you not hear what he said?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"About your crest? What about it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"D-Do you not know about it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have heard of the crest. Is that what you wanted to speak to me about? If that's the case, then I have no interest in it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"N-No! If you know what crest I have, then you have to know about the legends surrounding it! About the bad luck it brings!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Your point being?" Edelgard asked, before pausing "...That may have come off harsher than I meant. It is true that I do not understand the circumstances you've been through, but I do understand that the professor wants you to join our class, so I shall take her word on it. I care not about your crest, only what you can do." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Th-That…" Marianne looked away, unable to meet the piercing stare of Edelgard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You've suffered much because of your crest, haven't you?" Edelgard asked, making Marianne stiffen. "Let me say this, even if your crest brings bad luck, there is no need to worry on my behalf. Instead, it is my duty as your house leader to help you. Were I to falter simply because of 'bad luck', I would be unfit to be the emperor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Y-You're just saying that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Perhaps I am," Edelgard admitted, before she gave her a small smile, "You'll just have to see if I am. Now then, I had wanted to introduce you to the rest of your new classmates, but perhaps that should wait until tomorrow. Until then, I wish you a good day." Edelgard bowed to her–to her! Of all people!–before walking away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Staying silent, Marianne felt a strange emotion in her, one she wasn't used to… Shaking her head, she walked off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mindlessly walking to her room, Marianne kept her gaze downward, something she was accustomed to doing, but this time, something caught her eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh?" Reaching down, she grabbed a small case that seemed to have a small animal embroidered on it. "How cute…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A-Ah! Th-That's mine!" shouted a panicked voice, almost making Marianne drop the case before she turned to see Bernadetta standing nearby. "W-Why do you have that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I-I'm sorry, I just noticed it! I-I just w-wanted to see w-what the a-animal on it was," Marianne replied, not wanting to anger the Black Eagle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...H-Huh? You don’t know about hedgehogs?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I-Is that what it's called? I-I don't think they're c-common in the Alliance," Marianne explained, still holding the case. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"R-Really? B-But they're so adorable! Everyone should know about them, I mean, how many other animals grow spines on their backs to keep themselves safe!" Bernadetta exclaimed, suddenly very excited. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, is that why they have spikes?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, they roll up into balls so the spines keep them completely covered," Bernadetta explained with a smile, "Makes me wish I could do something like that…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That does sound nice,” Marianne mumbled in agreement, prompting a slightly bigger smile from Bernadetta.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It does! Are there, um, any animals like this in the alliance?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…not off the top of my head. Though I do have an encyclopedia if you want to borrow it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I-I can??" Bernadetta asked, seeming excited. "W-Well, I can find a book about Empire animals, if you want." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Th-There's no need to put yourself out for me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I-It's not a big deal! I-I mean, I don't really have anyone t-to talk about with these kinds of things…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Well, if you would have me, okay." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Th-Thank you! A-Ah, r-right, a-ah, I should introduce myself, right? M-My name is Bernadetta." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Ah, yes, I know who you are, Bernadetta." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Y-You do? S-Sorry, I-I tend to s-stay in my room, so I d-don’t really know anyone outside of my class." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…well, in that case. My name is Marianne von Edmund, and I'll be joining the Black Eagles." </span>

  <p>
  <span>It felt kind of mean to even think it, but Shez was really starting to dislike being in the Blue Lions’ classroom. After a week of being scared her sister would never wake up, the relief she felt at seeing Byleth open her eyes again was pretty soundly smothered by the heavy atmosphere that settled over everything once their next mission was announced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Apparently a group of bandits managed to steal a relic from a noble house. That wasn’t too bad, in Shez’s opinion; really, it sounded like the start off to a fun story. The problem was that the relic was a crest weapon, specifically one called the Lance of Ruin, and it had been stolen from House Gautier, otherwise known as Sylvain’s family. And not only that, but the leader of said bandits happened to be Sylvain’s older brother Miklan. The one he’d told her about.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Speaking of, Shez and Sylvain…well, they didn’t really talk now. Things had already been rocky after he thought it was a good idea to spill all his problems on Shez and then threaten her sister in the same breath, but then Byleth actually got hurt and…Well, call it bad timing, but Shez didn’t really want to interact with him after that point. Not when she couldn’t help but see him as a genuine threat to her sister’s well-being.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To be fair to Sylvain, he at least recognized there was a problem and kept his distance too, but that just led to everyone else noticing their problem and apparently that meant they all needed to have an opinion on the subject. The worst was Ingrid trying to apologize on Sylvain’s behalf because she thought he’d tried flirting with Shez again. It was an awkward conversation, to say the least, especially because Shez wasn’t comfortable actually sharing what Sylvain said with how private most of it was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So yeah, there was one friendship potentially ruined, and right as the mission of the month was basically focused on the guy in question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez? Are you feeling okay?” Mercedes asked, sounding concerned, “You seem to be staring into your tea." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, just thinking. The mission this month seems pretty big, huh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, it does…I knew Sylvain didn't have the best relationship with his family, but I never thought his father would request his class to handle his brother…" Mercedes muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…hey, do either of you two know about the knight we'll be working with?" Shez asked, wanting to change the subject away from Sylvain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I think I do!” Annette answered, “I saw him earlier, but he ran away after he saw me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really? Why would he run away?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That knight…he's my father,” she admitted, “He's using a different name, but I'm certain he is!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. "Huh. Not trying to be rude, but that doesn't explain why he ran away." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, it’s okay, I can understand why you would ask. After the tragedy of Duscur, my father blamed himself for not being able to save the king. He…left my mother and I behind. I didn’t know where he went to, but I knew the Church took in knights like him, and now I found him!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Annie, that’s wonderful!” Mercedes said, smiling happily at the news.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, had a confused frown. “That sounds great, but didn’t you just say he ran away from you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, yeah… I don't know why, but he's been avoiding me. Even before now, he hasn't contacted me or mother, but he can't keep running forever! I'll make sure to bring him back home so he can apologize to mom!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm. Do you want me to beat him up?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh?" It seemed that surprised both Mercedes and Annette with how shocked they looked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sh-Shez, I'm not certain how that could help." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, her dad left without a word, yeah? I might not know everything going on, but it sounds shitty that he's avoiding you. So if I beat him up he won't be able to run away so you can talk to him, or just drag him home." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Th-Thank you for the offer Shez, but I don't know if that'll help. Father might be old, but he's still a knight, so I would hate for you to get hurt." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, I'm sure I can take him on, but fine. Still, if you need any help, feel free to ask. Parents should look out for their kids, and he has a lot to make up for if he's actually been gone for a bunch of years." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well… I appreciate the offer, so thanks Shez. Who knows, if he proves to be a hassle I might just take you up on it," Annette jokingly said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just say the word." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez, a word please." Glancing up, Shez found Dimitri standing nearby with Dedue behind him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, uh, sure?" A bit confused, Shez set down her cup, before getting up. "Thanks for the tea, Mercedes, Annette." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"See you later, Shez!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Always a pleasure." Waving goodbye to the two, Shez followed behind Dimitri as he led her somewhere to speak. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How are you doing Shez?" Dimitri asked once they found a quiet location. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh… okay I guess? I'm glad Byleth is awake at least." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, it's good to hear she's recovering, though I'm truly sorry we weren't able to arrive faster." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to apologize,” she replied, deciding not to mention that this wasn’t the first time Dimitri had apologized for it, “We just gotta make sure to get there on time next time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, well, that does bring me up to what I wanted to talk about. As I've heard, that knight is quite the dangerous foe, who has been causing trouble for many years. It seems what happened at the Mausoleum was just the latest incident of his. Your sister might have been his latest victim, but I swear it'll be his last. On my honor as the prince of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, I swear I will help you get vengeance." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"....U-Uh, Dimitri, has anyone ever told you how intense you can be sometimes?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He blinked. "Excuse me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Like, thanks for the offer, but I'm not going to go out and seek revenge, I just wanna make sure my sister is okay. Which, side note, don't call her a victim okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I understand my words may not have been the best, but do you truly not want to seek revenge?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, sure, if I get the chance to take a shot at the guy, I'll go for it. But I'm not going to go off on a revenge quest, I wanna make sure By is fully healed up first. If she wants revenge, then sure, we'll ask for your help, but until then I'm not going for it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez wasn't completely sure, but it kinda seemed like Dimitri was confused by what she was saying? "...I see, you're prioritizing care. I can understand that. Still, we must not be hesitant, lest more victims arise." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I said not to call By a victim. She's not a damsel in distress, Dimitri." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My apologies, I meant no offense." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, sure," Shez said, frowning, "If that's all, then I'm going." Without waiting for another word, Shez turned around and left, vaguely hearing Dimitri call out to her for a moment. She wasn’t sticking around to hear anything else though.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez sighed, scratching at the back of her head. She didn’t like how complicated things were getting…and she probably should’ve said something to Dedue there. Said hi, at least.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, today sucks…” she grumbled, before pausing as she heard…muttering?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C-Come on Bernie, the professor bought you a new bow a-and everything, y-you need to do this…” Bernadetta muttered to herself, her hands tight on her brand new longbow. She stared at the entrance to the training hall, trying to muster up the courage to go in there… “A-Ah, n-no, I-I shouldn’t, th-there’s going to be people in there and they’re going to see me and they’ll know I’m terrible…hhh, b-but the professor…b-but, well, technically she didn’t get up and buy it, right? She had one of those scary mercenaries help…a-and they’ll probably kill me if I don’t practice with it, oh no–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Bernie,” Shez greeted, before blinking as the shorter girl outright screamed in fright before brandishing the bow at her. Though, not like someone would brandish a bow; she was holding it like it was a lance, for some reason.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“S-STAY BACK–O-Oh, w-wait, it’s–AH! STAY BACK!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, I guess you’re still terrified of me.” Shez frowned. “Hey, Bernie, why are you so terrified of me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-AS IF YOU DON’T KNOW!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...But I don’t know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“D-DON’T LIE!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not lying. I genuinely don’t know why you’re so afraid of me. Or…mad at me? Is this what it looks like when you’re mad at someone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Bernadetta gave her a very suspicious look, but stopped pointing her bow at Shez in favor of holding it to her chest. “...y-you really don’t remember? B-But you glared right at me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? When did I glare at you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-When you were leaving my house!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…When did Shez go to her house? “Uh…could you give me some more context? Because I still don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Y-You should! I-It was, um…f-five years ago, I think, a-and your father was working for my father and my father didn’t pay your father and you glared at me when you left!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez frowned, then closed her eyes, trying to think. Five years ago, and Bernie’s dad didn’t pay her dad… “OH! You’re Count Varley’s daughter?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“AH DON’T BE MAD!” Bernadetta yelped, before Shez’s words actually registered. “Wait–Huh? H-Hold on, you…didn’t know that I’m Gregoire von Varley’s daughter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No? How would I?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...M-My name is Bernadetta von Varley.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah but you could’ve been a niece or something. Wow, I didn’t guess that at all. I thought for sure his daughter would be some haughty, callous jerk like he is. But you’re so…” She gestured to Bernadetta.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...h-hm. I-I know I’m pathetic, you don’t need to say it…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? No, I mean you’re tiny and skittish, not all ‘ohoho’ and vain. How the heck did you come from a huge jackass like that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...W-Well, my father tied me to a chair so I would be more quiet and ladylike…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh. Oh I see.” Shez nodded. “I’m going to kill your dad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What?! W-Wait, y-you can’t! He’s…I mean…w-well he’s…okay, he doesn’t have any redeeming qualities, but you still shouldn’t!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not actually hearing a reason why I shouldn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-He’s the Minister of Religious Affairs! Th-The whole Empire would go after you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, I’ll just ask Edelgard if I can first.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“N-No! Th-That’s…w-wait, would that work…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably. Though…okay, give me a while to figure it out first. I should probably ask Byleth for a plan first…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“P-Please d-don’t tell Professor Byleth about this…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm…okay, fine, we’ll save that for later. For now, uh…what were we talking about…oh, right, yeah, I’m not mad at you. I kind of forgot about that until you brought it up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...B-But now you remember a-and you want to kill me!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No? Look, Bernie, I promise I’m not going to kill you. Byleth likes you, you’re my classmate, and you seem like a nice girl, so no, I’m not going to kill you. I have zero reason to! Heck, I have more reason to keep you alive because Byleth likes you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...sh-she does?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, she does. And I’m sure I’ll like you too once I get to know you. So, hey, what are you up to right now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh, um…” Bernadetta glanced at the bow in her hands. “I-I was going to h-head to the training hall t-to try out my new bow…u-um, th-that scary mercenary bought i-it for me b-because of the professor…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, the big, bald, bearded guy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“N-No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Then, uh, the kind of wiry guy with the goatee?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“N-No?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…the stern lady in healer clothes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bernie shook her head. “Mm mm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...the blonde one?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Y-Yes! Her! Sh-She’s terrifying…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez considered what she knew of Candace…then nodded. “Yeah, that makes sense. Well, hey, why don’t I come with you? We might as well hang out some more, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Huh? U-Uh, I-I don’t know–Eep!” Bernadetta squeaked as Shez took her by the shoulder and steered her towards the training hall. “A-Ah, w-w-wait, I-I changed my mind! I-I’m fine! I’m completely fine! I-I can practice better at night anyway!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C’mon Bernie, it’s fine. We’ll just get you set up and–Oh hey, I didn’t know Ashe and Felix were in here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bernadetta didn’t either and she made a mildly terrified noise at the sight of the two boys. Not that they were doing anything especially terrifying, considering Ashe was just practicing striking at a dummy with a lance, and not really doing that well at it, while Felix was practicing sword forms. Though the black-haired boy immediately paused once he noticed Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Shez, get over here. I need a sparring partner.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure, just give me a bit.” Guiding Bernadetta over to where targets were set up, Shez made sure she was facing them. “There we go, just call me over if you need any help.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Okay…” With that, Shez walked over to where Felix was, before catching a sword he tossed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not wasting any time huh?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re going up against someone with a crest weapon, and even if he was disowned, Sylvain’s brother was trained from birth to be a military leader. Of course, that just means he’s that much more worthy of an opponent.” Felix explained. “Speaking of, your sister has a relic weapon now, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good, tell her to heal quickly, I want to be able to face off against someone who can wield a legendary weapon like that,” Felix said, as he got into his stance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Felix, I know you’re not one for tact, but my sister almost died, maybe wait till she’s recovered to say something like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She lived, didn’t she?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez stared at Felix, dead silent. “...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What? Say something,” he demanded. He tried not to show it, but something in her stare was…discomforting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez just held her sword out and dropped it on the floor, before turning on her heel and leaving with her hands balled into fists.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Hey! We were going to spar!” he complained, but Shez didn’t reply or look back. “...the hell is her problem?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is </span>
  <em>
    <span>wrong</span>
  </em>
  <span> with him!?” Shez growled under her breath, though the deep scowl on her face faded quickly when she nearly ran into someone. “Ah, sorry–Oh, hey Em.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey yourself,” Emily greeted, raising an eyebrow, “You look fit to kill someone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. No, I’m not that pissed off…though I did agree to kill Bernie’s dad for her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh, the mousy girl? Huh, I didn’t think she had it in her,” Emily muttered, sounding impressed. Which Shez wasn’t about to touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So what are you up to? Going to train?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily gave Shez a look like she was being an idiot and crossed her arms over her chest. “Why else would I be going to the training grounds?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I dunno, maybe a secret rendezvous?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She scoffed. “The training grounds are way too open for any meetings. You should know that–Look, never mind. Unless you’re planning to go train with me, get going with whatever you were doing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, alright. And, ah, no, I don’t think I’m going in there right now. Though I’m kind of curious what brought this on. I haven’t seen you around the training grounds before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Emily sighed, looking irritated. “It’s because of that knight. Him and your sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Yeah, okay, I can understand that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good, then I don’t need to explain myself. Just know this, Shez. I’ll use this place to get as strong as I need to. Stronger than you, stronger than your sister, and strong enough to beat </span>
  <em>
    <span>anyone</span>
  </em>
  <span> I ever have to face. You got that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. Yeah I do! But don’t think it’ll be easy! I’m getting better every day too! So you’ve got a long way to go if you want to get to my level!” she encouraged with a big grin, earning an amused huff from her friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, talk big, but it won’t be long before I’m the one on top~. Now, seriously, if you’re not sticking around, get out of here. I have shit to do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, sure Em. See you around!” Shez said, waving to her friend as she headed off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, after walking for a few seconds, Shez paused again as a thought occurred. “Oh, shit, I just left Bernie there without a word…ah, she’ll probably be fine. Em’s one of her classmates, she’ll be nice.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“...Oh damn it all,” Shez muttered, her bad mood returning rapidly when she noticed who happened to be standing outside of the infirmary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–don’t understand why you won’t even try to–Oh, Shez!” Ingrid perked up upon noticing her classmate, which was kind of nice to see. What wasn’t nice to see was who she was with, and Sylvain seemed to agree based on how he winced once he noticed Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, this is going to suck…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez could agreed to that, though she really didn’t want to considering who was saying it. “Hi Ingrid. Hey Sylvain. Are you two here to see my sister?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was planning on it, but Sylvain doesn’t want to, for some reason,” Ingrid complained, frowning at her friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s just…Well, Shez knows why it’s a bad idea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez felt her frown return as Sylvain passed the buck to her, something he noticed and grimaced to see. “Yeah, I can think of a reason.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Ingrid glanced between Sylvain and Shez with a concerned frown of her own. “Okay, what is going on between you two? Shez, I know Sylvain can be bad, but even he wouldn’t take advantage of the professor while she’s injured. He’s not that terrible.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know he's not that bad. It’s a different concern.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what is that concern? Come on, you two have been avoiding each other for weeks now. I’m starting to think something really bad happened here and it’s worrying me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez glanced at Sylvain. “...Do you want me to say anything?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” He sighed. “Sure, you might as well. It’s not like I deserve any better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sylvain?” Ingrid looked genuinely worried by this point and the sight made Shez’s stomach turn. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sylvain talked to me,” Shez answered, “He wasn’t flirting, he just wanted to check in with me after I had an argument with By. It was a nice gesture. Kinda thoughtful, honestly.” He looked surprised to hear that, but Shez ignored his reaction so she could keep going. “He talked about how much he hates his crest and how it ruined his life, and then he mentioned how he’s jealous of my sister because she didn’t have to deal with the problems of being a noble. He mentioned her owing a debt and making her pay for that crest. I took it as him threatening my sister, and I told him if he ever threatened her again, I would kill him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shrugged, trying to ignore the stunned look on Ingrid’s face. “I guess he’s thinking I would take it badly if he visited my injured sister after saying that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you?” Sylvain asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stared at him. “...Yeah. I would.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…Shez, I…Sylvain wouldn’t do that,” Ingrid tried to say, though she looked like she was still trying to get her thoughts in order, “I know he’s a lot to deal with, but he wouldn’t hurt anyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know you believe that, but you grew up with him, Ingrid,” Shez replied, “You’re close, so sure, I can believe that you’re sure he wouldn’t hurt my sister, but I’ve only known him for a few months, and all I know is that he says he doesn’t like seeing girls cry, but makes them cry anyway. So, sure, I can believe he’d swear up and down that he’d never hurt a hair on my sister’s head. But I’m sure as hell not leaving him alone in the same room as her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s fair,” Sylvain said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Sylvain?” Ingrid looked at him. She still looked lost, like she’d just had part of her world turned upside down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s right, Ingrid. I can swear all I want that I didn’t mean it, but she has no reason to trust me and plenty of reason to think I’m lying.” He glanced at the infirmary door, then let out a sigh. “...I’m sorry. No matter what I feel, I shouldn’t have said that. And I know I shouldn’t take my problems out on other people. I just…I’m just kind of pathetic like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sylvain…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez let out a sigh of her own. “...I don’t think I’m gonna stick around after this month.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both of her classmates paused at that, before staring at her in confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“At the academy?” Sylvain asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m still sticking around here until the year is up. It’s just…I don’t think I’m doing good in this class. I’m just not enjoying it, you know? So…I don’t know for sure if this is it, or what I might decide later, but I thought I should let you two know since you’re here and all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...W-Wait, Shez, you don’t have to leave!” Ingrid insisted, “Please, I know things might be rough right now, but–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She paused, then looked up at Sylvain with wide eyes. “Sylvain!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, if it’s what she wants, it’s what she wants. I’m just sorry for my part in it driving you off, Shez. I swear, I didn’t want this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez huffed, grinning a little. “Yeah, I know, you’d rather keep all the pretty girls by your side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” He looked surprised at her teasing, before he tried to grin back. “Yeah, you know me…I don’t like making girls cry, but it seems to be all I’m good at.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not crying, jerk. I’m mad. There’s a difference.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh believe me, I know that.” He sighed again, deeper and longer than before. “...I know it doesn’t mean much, but I swear to you, I will never do anything to hurt your sister. I might not have much honor, but on what little I do have left, I promise you that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...well, they do say a knight of Faerghus will always keep their oath.” Shez shrugged. “...Do you want to come in? Hang out with me and Byleth for a bit?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Heh. Ah, maybe some other time? Before we head out for the mission, at least.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure. I’m sure she’d like to say hi.” She glanced at Ingrid. “The offer’s open to you too, if you want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh? Oh, uh…Actually, I think I’m going to decline for now too. I think…” Ingrid looked up at Sylvain again. “...I think Sylvain and I should talk for a bit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A pained look crossed Sylvain’s face for a moment, before he nodded to her request.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay. See you two around, alright? I wouldn’t mind talking some more, if you’re up for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, sure. Thank you, Shez.” Ingrid smiled, though it was a troubled one.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah. I’ll see you around, Shez.” Sylvain looked conflicted, then just nodded to her. “Thanks for giving me another chance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah. Just don’t ruin it or I’ll tear your balls off.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Eesh. You think we could just stick to the death threats next time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, if you insist.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez waved off her classmates…her two friends, then turned to the infirmary door. “...I really hope this thing’s thick enough that nobody heard anything…” She shook her head, then slapped her cheeks. “Alright, c’mon. You’re visiting By, be happy. Woo, alright, no more angst, time for happy!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with that, she pushed the door open and headed inside. “Hey By, how’s it–Oh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey Shez,” Byleth greeted from her usual bed, sitting up again with her legs crossed and five playing cards in her hands. Because apparently she had a card deck with her, and was playing poker with Edelgard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Imperial Crown Princess looked faintly annoyed at her hand, before she glanced over at Shez. “Oh, hello. I didn’t know you were visiting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I didn’t know you were going to be playing poker in here, so that makes two of us,” Shez replied, before pulling up a chair to Byleth’s bedside, on the same side as Edelgard so she could peek at her hand. “Oh wow, that’s bad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am aware, yes, though I am also fairly certain you shouldn’t be giving that away to my opponent,” she chided, looking irritated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah but I'm pretty sure By already knew." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You do have a bad poker face, Edelgard." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Letting out a sigh, Edelgard tossed her cards onto the bed. "Fine, I fold." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, it's a real good thing you're not playing for money. By might not cheat like the others do in cards, but you'll have a hard time reading her if you haven't known her for a long time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're getting better at least. It doesn't seem like you just learned how to play. Do you want to play again?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to comfort me, and no, I really should be going. I would hate to intrude upon your time with your sister," Edelgard said as she glanced at Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay, see you tomorrow?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Of course, professor. I'll see you then." With a bow, Edelgard left, and if Shez hadn't been watching her leave, she would have missed Hubert slinking out of a corner to follow behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You know, sometimes I feel like that guy might be Edelgard’s ghost friend," Shez muttered, before turning to face Byleth, "So, how are you feeling?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Better. Manuela says I'm healing quickly, both Hanneman and Lin say it's probably because of my crest."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh, that's handy. Though, you know, if you had Arval I'm sure you would have been up and ready by now." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I guess crests aren't that big of a deal," Byleth responded back, amused. "I mean, you can just summon a sword out of nowhere, I have to find one that just so happens to work with my crest."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, you hear that Arval? She's admitting you're better than her powers." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, that’s only natural,” the voice in her head said, sounding smug, “Her powers may be frightening, but as my partner, you'd obviously end up with something better." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm." Tilting her head, Byleth frowned. "Sothis is mad at what I said. And that turning the hands of time is infinitely better than a sword." And that got Arval mad.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh…Arval says that at least he can make sure to heal his partner right away." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Sothis says her powers can help save other people." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Why are we arguing for the ghosts in our head?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. "Seems rude to ignore them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah but they're being stupid." And that got an angry squawk from Arval and Sothis, though Shez couldn't hear the latter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"True. When are you going on your mission? It's fairly north in the Kingdom, yeah?" Byleth asked, ignoring how her words further incensed the spirits. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not sure. Probably a week before the end of the month, at least. Either way, I'm sure your students are glad to not have to go to the kingdom again. Don't think any of them want to deal with that cold again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I definitely don't," Byleth responded, making Shez laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re the one that has magic to keep her warm though!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hope I'm not interrupting," Jeralt spoke up as he leaned in from the doorway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, hey dad, something up?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, just…I wanted to show you two something. I already got permission from Manuela for you to come with me." As he spoke, they noticed he had some flowers in hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh… sure?" Glancing between themselves, Byleth and Shez felt a bit worried. Still, Shez helped her sister get out of bed and get dressed as Jeralt waited outside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Where are we going?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Something I should have shown you before," Jeralt said, leading the sisters downstairs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It felt weird, they were used to their dad being quiet sometimes, but he was never… solemn like this. Silently following him, the trio further made their way down, until they arrived at a graveyard. Confused, Byleth looked around, before her eyes stopped on one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sitri.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? What, what did you–” Shez paused as she noticed the grave too. “...uh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She glanced at her sister, who was just…quiet. Which wasn’t unusual for Byleth, but she was staring right at the grave too, which made her silence…kind of uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez looked back at her dad, who was just watching too, and tried to smile. “Uh…this, um, feels…kind of private, so I’m just gonna–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Byleth took her hand in hers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused, then looked at her sister, who seemed…Well, it was hard to tell. Byleth always did have a stoic face. So Shez just gave her sister’s hand a reassuring squeeze, and felt a smile come to her face when she saw Byleth relax slightly, some of her tension fading at her presence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth let go of her hand after a moment, then moved up to the grave and crouched down, just examining it for the moment. “...What…should I do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well, I know some people, uh…talk at graves,” Shez offered, standing behind her sister. She still felt…kind of awkward, being her, since Sitri wasn’t her mom, but…she put a hand on Byleth’s shoulder and moved next to her. Still standing, but at her side now. “It helps, I think.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hello mama,” Byleth murmured in a small voice. She swallowed, her throat strangely tight. “It’s nice to meet you. I wish I could have known you while you were alive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She reached up, taking her sister’s hand again, and tugged, encouraging Shez to crouch beside her before she continued. “This is Shez. She’s my sister. You wouldn’t have met her because she had a different mom, but she’s family. I think you would have liked her. She’s the best sister I could have ever asked for.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...J-Jeez, it’s like you’re trying to make me cry,” Shez mumbled, her throat tight too, before she smiled at the grave, “H-Hey there, uh…H-Heh, sorry, I don’t know if I should call you Sitri or Missus Eisner or…I-I guess I wouldn’t mind calling you mom too. You’d, um, be the third one I’ve had. My second mom’s name was Periander, and I bet you two would have liked each other. She was really smart and thoughtful, and I think you’d be similar, you know? Though, uh, I guess that’s guessing a lot about you, but…I’m sure you would’ve been great. I’m kind of sad I didn’t get to meet you either.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt smiled, faintly, as he watched his daughters talk to his wife’s grave. It felt like it should be strange, living as long as he had and yet still feeling her loss so very strongly, but he didn’t mind it too much. It meant he was still human, despite everything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He kept that thought in mind as he stepped next to his daughters. The two glanced up at him, looking nothing alike and nothing at all like him. But that didn’t matter, because they were his kids. And he smiled as he handed Byleth the flowers. “Here. I think your mom would like these. They were her favorites.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth swallowed again, and Jeralt felt a faint pang of surprise and sadness to see a tear roll down her cheek for the first time he could remember seeing. Then she smiled, and that small hurt faded completely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, papa,” she murmured, before glancing at Shez, who nodded to her with an encouraging grin. One Byleth couldn’t help but return with the biggest smile either of her family members had seen before she faced the grave again and laid the flowers down in front of it. “I hope you like them. It was very nice to meet you. Thank you for giving me life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They stayed by the grave for a time after that. Byleth leaned on Shez, emotionally drained but still smiling faintly as her sister wrapped an arm around her, giving her a hug. For a moment, everything else seemed to fade, and it was just the Eisner family, all together in one place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Shez was never going to let anyone hurt her sister. Never again.</span>

  <p>Shez frowned to herself as she watched the stars overhead. She still felt listless and she wasn’t sure why. Byleth was fine, right? She was alive, but…things hadn’t gone back to normal yet.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth was still in bed most of the time, staying in the infirmary so Manuela or Gertrude could keep an eye on her, the latter taking over while the former had classes to teach, and that meant the world still felt out of balance to the purple-haired merc. It was a weird feeling. And one she didn’t really like.</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose your trepidation is only natural,” Arval commented, floating alongside her, “Your destined rival was felled by a truly monstrous foe. One would most certainly be off put, even if she had completely recovered by now." </p><p> </p><p>"...Yeah. I get what you mean," Shez responded, sighing as she sat up, stretching her arms as she did. As nice as it was to look at the stars from a rooftop, it definitely wasn't easy on her back. </p><p> </p><p>"Now, I think we should be–hm? What is that?" Arval suddenly asked, glancing down. Following their gaze, Shez looked down as well, spotting not only the house leaders, but a student from each house with them. "Well that is certainly an odd group."</p><p> </p><p>"Huh." Well Shez was certainly interested. So it came to no surprise she would hop down. </p><p> </p><p>"Let's just hope we're not marching to certain doom," Claude said as Shez landed behind him. </p><p> </p><p>"What's that about doom?" Shez asked, getting most of the group to yelp in surprise at her sudden appearance. Which, well, was completely unintentional, but she was definitely going to savor the feeling. </p><p> </p><p>"Shez? What are you doing here?" Edelgard asked, narrowing her eyes at her like she didn’t just squeak in fright. </p><p> </p><p>"I was hanging out on the rooftop until I saw you guys down here." </p><p> </p><p>"And why were you on the rooftop?" Claude asked as he quirked an eyebrow. </p><p> </p><p>"Thinking about stuff. Why are you guys hanging out together this late?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, Claude saw someone suspicious, so we were hoping to follow them. Which we should get to doing before they get away," Dimitri answered. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh this is already sounding like a pain," Lindhart muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"But before we go, I did have a suggestion to make that Edelgard cruelly struck down,” Claude interrupted, turning Edelgard’s annoyed glare towards him, “But I figure I might as well ask you Shez: Do you think we should ask Teach to join us?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not at all!" Shez immediately responded, "Edelgard has the right idea, By is still recovering." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I don't think it would be a good idea for Professor Byleth to come along," Ashe spoke up. </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, it seems you've been outvoted, Claude. Now come on, we might as well get this over with,” Hilda said with a grin while Claude let out a dramatic sigh. </p><p> </p><p>"Alright, I see a losing battle when I see one," Claude admitted before he began to lead the way through a hole in the wall. </p><p> </p><p>Letting out an amused huff, Shez followed along with the group, stepping close to Edelgard. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, thanks for making sure By didn't get dragged along."</p><p> </p><p>"...It's only natural I wouldn't want to put her in a dangerous situation when she's injured," Edelgard responded, "Though I suspect she likely would have come along if one of us did ask her." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, By can be like that. She really likes you guys, so she focuses more on protecting all of you instead of herself." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, that has been clear since the first mission. I never expected to meet a self-sacrificing mercenary like her." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, By can be dumb sometimes. Hence why I tend to keep an eye out for her." </p><p> </p><p>"...May I ask why exactly you didn't join the Black Eagles in that case?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I do want her to get out a bit more. Like, obviously she's still going to need my help, but I can't always be the talker, you know?" Shez responded, "I mean, she's going to eventually take over the mercenary group, so that means she'll be the one accepting missions." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…I can see the logic there," Edelgard said, before she began to study Shez. "...What if I were to hire Jeralt’s Mercenaries once you all leave the academy?" </p><p> </p><p>"Woah, really?" Shez asked, before she blinked. "Huh… that's right, you guys made that offer back at the start of the year… heh, well if you pay well, I definitely wouldn't say no." </p><p> </p><p>"In that case, care to regale me with more tales of your journeys? The more I know, the better I'll be able to pay."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh sure! In that case…Hm, I already told you about our daring adventure against the Red Tyrant…oh, I know! Allow me to regale you, your highness, with the tale of the Cruel Machinations of the Scorpion Gang!" </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard did her best to suppress a giggle as Shez launched into a clearly exaggerated tale of her and Byleth dealing with a smuggling ring. Well, it wasn't exactly what Edelgard was asking about, but might as well listen to hear if she heard anything important.</p><hr /><p>"And that's when I came crashing through the window, blades at the ready as Byleth and I took on the scorpion boss!" Shez said to her crowd of classmates, all of whom had become invested in the story as they walked. </p><p> </p><p>"You didn't go get back up?" Dimitri asked, a bit surprised. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course not, By and I are invincible together!" Shez responded with a grin, "Why would we ask for backup?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, I dunno, seems like you'll definitely need back up," a new voice piped in, getting the students’ attention as they saw a tall, muscular man approach them. He smirked while cracking his knuckles. "Around here you'll definitely need more than this small group if you want to survive." </p><p> </p><p>"Identify yourself!" Dimitri demanded, even as he and the house leaders got into defensive positions. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey now, don't you know it's only polite to introduce yourself first? Especially if you're going to be intruding on someone's home." </p><p> </p><p>"Eegh, you live down here?" Hilda asked, frowning at him. </p><p> </p><p>"That we do! And I refuse to allow any invader trample upon our home!" another voice said, getting their attention as a posh-looking blonde walked up. "Especially if they mean to eliminate the good people of Abyss!" </p><p> </p><p>"Abyss?" Claude asked, curious about that tidbit. </p><p> </p><p>"For the record, I don't plan on eliminating anything so feel free to ignore me," Lindhart said. </p><p> </p><p>"Ha! You cannot fool me! The eyes of Constance von Nuvelle can see through your lies!" </p><p> </p><p>"Nuvelle?" Edelgard muttered, surprised at that name. </p><p> </p><p>"So, you guys mind calming down and telling us what's up?" Shez asked, raising a hand to catch everyone's attention. </p><p> </p><p>"That's what I want to know," spoke yet another voice. This time two people arrived: a pretty boy with lavender hair and a bored looking girl with dark skin and red hair. "I mean, here we were, minding our own business, only for a bunch of students with weapons to come visit us. I'm sure my friends and I would love to hear what you're doing." </p><p> </p><p>At that, Shez heard a rock get kicked behind her, catching her attention as she turned around to see several goons behind them. </p><p> </p><p>"A-Ah, guys, any way we can try escaping?" Ashe asked, pulling out his bow. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't think we have the option," Dimitri responded as the other students brought out their weapons. </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, glad to hear!" Shez shouted, pulling out her own sword, “I've been waiting for a fight!" </p><p> </p><p>“Now you’re speaking my language!” the big guy yelled back, raising his hands to show a pair of wicked looking gauntlets affixed to them, “You better get ready, because you’re about to face the Indomitable King of Grappling!”</p><p> </p><p>Hilda blinked at that statement, a thoughtful look crossing her face even as she readied her axe and the rest of the students prepared for a fight.</p><p> </p><p>“Well this is going to be a mess,” the pretty boy complained, before looking at his compatriots, “Try not to kill anyone, alright? We’re looking for information here, not a bloodbath.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha! Don’t worry, Yuri, I’m just gonna put these kids to bed!” the King of Grappling declared, before taking the lead as he and all the other goons rushed right in.</p><p> </p><p>Shez felt a big grin come to her face as she lunged for the “King”, summoning her special sword to her hand and diving right into the fray. Though since that Yuri guy told his guys not to try to kill anyone, she decided to be nice and not just start cutting off heads. Shallow cuts and some kicks to knock people out were the way to go this time around!</p><p> </p><p>Though she did reevaluate her plan to hold back once she actually got close to his Kingliness and the guy nearly knocked her flat with a punch that just barely missed her head. “Woah! Looks like that title of yours isn’t just for show, your majesty!”</p><p> </p><p>"Ha! Of course it isn't, I'm not the Majestic King of Grappling for nothing!" The man boasted with a toothy grin before following up his attack with one to her gut. Dodging by transforming into a trail of purple light, Shez backed away from him before coming back to kick a goon who was about to attack Dimitri from behind. </p><p> </p><p>"In that case, let me introduce myself! I'm the Invincible Violet Demon! Feel free to give up if you're afraid!" </p><p> </p><p>"Ha! Why would the Undefeated King of Grappling give up against some no name punk!" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Shez’s eyes narrowed in response, before she suddenly appeared in front of him, kicking him in the face. "How's that for no name punk–Woah!" </p><p> </p><p>Shez yelped as a firm hand tightened around her leg, before she went flying through the air from a strong toss.</p><p> </p><p>"Starting to think your sister was right with no taunting your opponent if they're still a threat," Arval oh so helpfully chimed in as Shez twisted in the air to land. </p><p> </p><p>Huffing, she rushed back into the fight, only to dodge a slash from the pretty boy, Yuri. </p><p> </p><p>"Violet Demon, huh? I've heard of you. You're one of those mercenary sisters who joined the academy, aren't you?" </p><p> </p><p>"What about it?" Shez asked, grinning as they clashed blades, "If you're planning on hiring me you choose the wrong way to go about it!" </p><p> </p><p>"Come now, surely you have a price," he commented, before jerking back as an arrow went flying towards his face, courtesy of Ashe, “Watch it! A face like mine shouldn’t get scratched up!”</p><p> </p><p>Before she could thank her friend for the assist, Shez had to dodge a blast of magic sent at her by Blondie–<em> No, wait, her name’s Constance, she mentioned that. Right, keep track! </em></p><p> </p><p>Tucking and rolling, Shez got ready to fight again, before pausing when she realized the bored looking redhead was just leaning against a wall. </p><p> </p><p>"You uh, not going to join?" </p><p> </p><p>"Nah, they got it handled." </p><p> </p><p>"Hapi, you could at least pretend to help!" Yuri shouted, letting Shez know the last member of their group's name. </p><p> </p><p>"Fine," Hapi agreed with a sigh, before blinking. "Oh." </p><p> </p><p>Before Shez could ask what she meant, the wall next to them burst open and a crawler, as its name would imply, crawled through the hole in the wall with several more behind it. </p><p> </p><p>"Shit!" Getting up, Shez did the first thing that came to mind. That being, grabbing Hapi to get her away from the sudden demonic beast. </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, why are you holding me?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'm getting you away from that thing!" Shez shouted. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." <em> Well, it seems she doesn’t realize I summoned those things. Guess she’s a well-meaning idiot, </em>Hapi thought to herself. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey! She's trying to kidnap Hapi!" Though it seemed not everyone picked up on that, as made evident by Constance’s yell. “I knew these scoundrels were up to no good!”</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not kidnapping anyone!" Shez shouted while the lead crawler began to chase her, up until Edelgard slammed her axe into its side. </p><p> </p><p>"How about a ceasefire until we take these things out?" Edelgard asked while she backed away from the lead crawler, leaving a bloody furrow in the writhing monster’s side. </p><p> </p><p>"Well that sounds like a lovely idea," Yuri responded as he eyed the crawlers, "If you survive this, I'll even be willing to let you explain yourselves without siccing Balthus on you."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm definitely up for that if it means not dealing with him," Claude said as he fired a curved shot at a crawler. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey come on, I'm not that bad!" </p><p> </p><p>"You're pretty bad, B," Hapi muttered after Shez put her down, before a swarm of dark energy flew from her raised hands and began biting down on a crawler as Dimitri speared the beast. </p><p> </p><p>"If it gets things over with," Lindhart muttered, sending a cutting gale that actually sped up Ashe’s arrows as they were launched, sending them plunging deep into the monster he targeted.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, at least we aren't fighting each other!" Ashe said, trying to look on the bright side. </p><p> </p><p>"Ugh, I am so glad I brought a hand axe. This is already such a pain and I’m not about to get monster guts on me!" Hilda complained, before throwing the axe as hard as she could at the nearest crawler, getting the beast to wail as the blade slammed hard enough into its head to send it falling over. "Oh, yay I did it!" </p><p> </p><p>"Congrats, just a couple more to go," Claude snarked. </p><p> </p><p>"In that case, best get to work!" Shez shouted as she charged into the fray, grinning in delight as monster blood stained the ground. </p><hr /><p>“Alright! Now that was a workout!” Balthus declared with a big grin, his fists raised in triumph as he stood atop a fallen crawler, his foot planted firmly on the beast’s head, “Ha ha! But these things were no match for the Almighty King of Grappling!”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Wasn’t that the one you took out?” Shez asked Hilda, pointing to the axe embedded deep in the big worm’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Eh. Tall, buff, and burly can take credit if he really wants to,” Hilda decided, waving a hand dismissively, “It’s better that way, makes sure people don’t start getting weird ideas of putting expectations on a cute, helpless girl like me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I dunno about helpless…”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so you agree that I’m cute~?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well yeah, duh, you’re adorable,” Shez replied without hesitation, before pausing, “Oh hey, I think everybody else is meeting up over there with the new people. C’mon, let’s go!”</p><p> </p><p>"Fine fine," Hilda huffed as Balthus got off the Crawler, a grin coming to the big guy’s face as he looked over the pair of young ladies. </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, never thought I'd see little Hilda with a girlfriend!" </p><p> </p><p>Hilda paused, raising an eyebrow at him. "Huh? But I'm not even dating Marianne yet…wait, how do you know my name?" </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, come on, you don’t remember me? It's me, Balthus." </p><p> </p><p>"...Baltie???" Hilda asked, confusion turning to shock once she recognized him.</p><p> </p><p>"Yup, and don't worry, I won't tell Holst about you dating someone!" </p><p> </p><p>"Baltie, I already told you, I'm not dating anyone, yet. And I'm definitely not dating <em> Shez </em>." </p><p> </p><p>"...Ouch?" Shez said, having caught the emphasis in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, you know what I mean. Do you really think the two of us would work out together?" </p><p> </p><p>"....Eh, yeah, that's fair." </p><p> </p><p>"See? And besides, it's a bit hard to try and date Marianne since she's in a different class now." </p><p> </p><p>"...You could always join the Black Eagles," Edelgard offered, deciding to stop pretending she wasn’t listening to their conversation, which earned a huff from Claude. </p><p> </p><p>"Stop trying to poach my classmates." </p><p> </p><p>"No offense, Edelgard, but as nice as it would be to be in Marianne's class again, I feel like you'd expect too much of me," Hilda said, "I mean, I might be willing to join the Blue Lions cause Dimitri is more of a pushover, but I don't think you'd let me get away with anything." </p><p> </p><p>"...I'm standing right here," Dimitri said with a frown on his face. </p><p> </p><p>"I can't believe what I'm hearing! You'd actually abandon me Hilda?" Claude asked, an overly dramatic tone in his voice. </p><p> </p><p>"I mean…probably, yeah. Besides, Lorenz would probably be a better fit for your retainer." </p><p> </p><p>"Okay now you're just being cruel to me," Claude complained, “You really want me to take the most pompous noble in Fodlan as my retainer?”</p><p> </p><p>“I believe Ferdinand would argue that point,” Edelgard noted.</p><p> </p><p>“Seriously Edelgard? Are we really going to compete over who has the most pompous noble in their class?”</p><p> </p><p>“If we’re having a competition like that, I’d like to put Coco in the running,” Hapi offered, earning an affronted look from Constance.</p><p> </p><p>“Pompous?! I am not pompous! Though I will agree that I am far more noble than anyone else who may lay claim to such a title!”</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t your house lose its standing?” Linhardt asked with his usual amount of tact.</p><p> </p><p>“Temporarily! For you see, I, Constance von Nuvelle, shall ensure my house rises from the ashes once more and takes its rightful place as one of the premiere noble houses of Adrestia! Ohohohoho!”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, alright, she’s a strong competitor for the title,” Claude agreed, nodding to Hapi.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, as entertaining as this is, I do believe it would be best to discuss why exactly your group is down here,” Yuri brought up, eyeing the students. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, we came down here cause Claude apparently saw someone suspicious," Ashe explained. </p><p> </p><p>"It's not everyday a bandit decides to sneak into Garreg Mach, after all," Edelgard continued. </p><p> </p><p>"Or for students to find a group of people living under it,” Dimitri stated. </p><p> </p><p>"I see. Well, it’s for the best to avoid talking about this place on the surface. Most that are in the know aren't exactly fond of us down here. Abyss is a place of refuge for anyone who needs it, regardless of what they might have done in the past," Yuri explained, "Though that also leads to trouble, hence why we assumed you were attacking us." </p><p> </p><p>"Does this happen that often?" Dimitri asked. </p><p> </p><p>"In the past few months, yes. We've been dealing with some mercenary attacks, and while we don't know who they're working for, we're not exactly going to let them push us around." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, do you need help?" Shez asked.</p><p> </p><p>"You would offer your help so easily?" Constance inquired in return. </p><p> </p><p>"I mean, yeah? I was looking to work out some stress anyways so this helps." </p><p> </p><p>"In that case, I want to help out too!" Ashe piped in. "If people need help, then I won't ignore them." </p><p> </p><p>"You guys could at least try to get something out of this,” Claude muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"Come on now Claude, where's the harm in helping them out?" Dimitri asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Excellent. In that case, I suppose we might as well show you around the place before we get to work," Yuri said with a smirk. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure Aelfric will also appreciate the help," Balthus pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>"Aelfric?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah he's a big wig up in the church. He's also the guy in charge around here. I'm sure you'll think he's great when you meet him!"</p><hr /><p>“Woaaaaah, there really is a town down here!” Shez exclaimed, staring with wide, interested eyes at the underground town called Abyss.</p><p> </p><p>“What, did you think we were lying?” Yuri inquired with an amused grin, “Do I look like the type to lie?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yep.”</p><p> </p><p>“My, you are a blunt one. Well, either way, welcome to Abyss!” he declared, turning to the group and throwing his arms wide with a smirk, “There aren’t many rules down here, but I’m sure I don’t need to tell the fine students of Garreg Mach that they aren’t allowed to rob, assault, or kill any of the residents of our fine city down here.”</p><p> </p><p>“We would never do anything of the sort,” Dimitri assured, frowning at the very idea, which earned a roll of the eyes from Hapi.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a real good guy, huh Blondie?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, ah–Well, thank you, I do try to be.”</p><p> </p><p>“A real genius too,” she muttered, prompting a grin from Yuri.</p><p> </p><p>“Leaving aside my surly friend’s sarcasm for now, I do believe we should get around to actually introducing ourselves now. Or at least all of you should introduce yourselves, since I’m sure you overheard us mentioning each other’s names already.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right, of course,” Dimitri agreed, before placing a hand on his chest, “I am Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd, the Crown Prince of Faerghus and a student at the Officer’s Academy. And these two are my fellow classmates in the Blue Lions house, Ashe Ubert and Shez Eisner.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s nice to meet you,” Ashe greeted, his eyes lingering a little on Yuri as he tried to figure out where he’d seen the older teen before.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, I wanted to introduce myself,” Shez complained with a pout.</p><p> </p><p>“You know you still could, Shady,” Hapi pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, true. Alright then, I’m Shez Eisner, the Violet Demon, a legendary mercenary and daughter of Jeralt the Blade Breaker! Also the sister of Byleth Eisner, the Ashen Dragon, who is also cool.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ooo, a legendary merc, huh? Funny, I don’t think I’ve heard of you,” Balthus commented with a grin as Shez bristled.</p><p> </p><p>“I have,” Yuri noted, smirking, which earned a grin from Shez.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, you’re my new favorite.”</p><p> </p><p>“Heh, keep that up, Shez, and people might start thinking you’re fickle,” Claude commented, amused, before raising a hand in greeting, “Hey there, Claude von Riegan, and my friend who your friend already knows is Hilda Goneril.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hi Baltie! And Baltie’s friends!” Hilda greeted, playing up her cheerful, cute aspects to make a good first impression. Well, a good second impression. “It’s nice to meet all of you! I hope you’ll be nice to me~!”</p><p> </p><p>“Laying it on a little thick there, huh Hilda?” Balthus commented, which put a damper on her attempt.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, come on, Baltie, what are you saying?” Hilda asked with a pout. </p><p> </p><p>“To finish introductions, I am Edelgard Von Hresvelg, house leader of the Black Eagles,” Edelgard introduced, before glancing at Lindhart who seemed to almost be dozing off until she cleared her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I thought you’d introduce me so I wouldn’t have to.” He lazily raised his hand. “Lindhart.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, feel free to wander about, though try not to get lost. Abyss has yet to be fully explored by anyone so who knows what’s down here.” Yuri said, getting Shez to grin at the thought of finding–</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not wandering about,” Arval instantly interjected.“Knowing you, you’d wind up getting lost in here and appearing in Sreng when you exited.” </p><p> </p><p>“...” Now Shez was curious if this place did lead to Sreng. Maybe it even had secret passageways to the three nations' capitals…Well now she had to explore. </p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me my friend.” Or she would have if Yuri didn’t walk up to her. “I wanted to ask you for help.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh? With what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we’ve been having a bit of a problem with some mercenaries down here for a bit. So I was hoping you might be willing to help out with a plan we have.” </p><p> </p><p>“Heh, well I’m not going to say no, but we’re going to need to talk about payment first. I’m by myself so you don’t have to pay full price, but still, I’m not cheap.” </p><p> </p><p>Yuri couldn't help but smirk. <em> Well, she’s going to be fun. </em></p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Classes still hadn’t started back up for Byleth. She could understand why, since she’d been injured, but it was starting to bother her that she wasn’t teaching even when she felt up for it. Apparently getting her chest cut open made people worry about “recovery time” and stuff like that, which was definitely a new experience for her. She’d never been injured that badly before, and any injuries she did take tended to heal more quickly than whatever the Death Knight had done to her.</p><p> </p><p>So that meant the professor of the Black Eagles spent most of her recent days just hanging around with her students or her family, when she wasn’t resting. And when it was the middle of class time and nobody was visiting, well…Byleth wasn’t the type to get bored easily, that was more Shez’s thing, but after a full week of bed rest and light exercise, even she was starting to get restless.</p><p> </p><p>Then her father had work to do again and Shez was busy with classes so the chances of her keeping occupied decreased significantly. Still, she was at least allowed to walk around the campus now, so she started exploring a bit…and wound up going to her mother’s grave. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t sure why, exactly. Her feet just carried her there. The real surprise was seeing someone she hadn’t met before standing at the grave and holding a bouquet of flowers, just like the ones Jeralt brought before.</p><p> </p><p>“–sorry it’s taking so long. I hope I can see you soon,” the man mumbled, before placing the flowers beside the vase that was already there. A touch Byleth decided to add a little while ago. Then he turned and his eyes widened. “Oh, I…did not expect to see anyone else here. Ah…my apologies, you just…look quite familiar.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hello,” Byleth greeted in return, before glancing at the grave. “...Did you know my mother?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. So you are her daughter, I see.” The man nodded to himself, lost in thought, before he shook his head. “Ah, pardon me, my sincere apologies. I am Aelfric Dahlman, a cardinal of the Church of Seiros.” He placed his hand on his heart and bowed with a slight smile. “And you must be Sitri and Jeralt’s daughter then. I must say, I did not expect to run into you here.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged. “I was just visiting my mother. It’s nice to talk sometimes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, of course, I can understand that. Believe me, I understand that very well, haha…” He cleared his throat somewhat awkwardly. “My apologies, as I said, I was not expecting to run into anyone, much less Sitri’s daughter…and I appear to be repeating myself.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay, it happens. How did you know my mother?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, well, we grew up together, here in the church. Has, ah….Has Jeralt told you much about her?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged. “Some. I know it’s hard for him to talk about her. Did you know Jeralt too?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I did. I knew both of them quite well. I was raised as an orphan here and Sitri was easily my best friend. As for Captain Jeralt, I couldn’t help but idolize him. Not that I ever really measured up to him, but you know how it is.”</p><p> </p><p>"I guess." </p><p> </p><p>"Is Captain Jeralt here by any chance?" </p><p> </p><p>"He's on a mission. Not sure when he'll get back." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, that is a shame. If I knew he had returned, I would have made time to visit him…" </p><p> </p><p>"How didn’t you hear about him?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I've been quite busy. I've been tending to my flock in Abyss." </p><p> </p><p>"...Abyss?" She’d heard that name before.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my apologies, that was a slip of the tongue, but…" He looked around. "I suppose it wouldn't be bad to talk about it. Have you heard about Abyss?" </p><p> </p><p>"No.”</p><p> </p><p>"Heh, well, that’s not really a surprise… ah, but to explain, Abyss is a place where those seeking refuge can hide. Many of them are those who cannot seek shelter up above for one reason or another. I myself am the caretaker of the people residing down there." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh…that sounds nice," Byleth said, getting Aelfric to smile. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you. Would you like to visit? I'm sure you'd enjoy talking to those down there." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…okay, I don't have anything else to do." </p><p> </p><p>"Wonderful news. Here, I'll lead the way," Aelfric offered with a smile. Walking ahead, Aelfric gestured for her to follow. "If I may ask, were you the one who left the vase of flowers?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. It felt nice to do." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure Sitri was happy to see them. It did surprise me when I saw them though. I'm the only one who tends to her grave, so I didn't expect to see them." </p><p> </p><p>"I see. Though Shez was the one who chose the vase," Byleth said, before realizing Aelfric wouldn't know who she was. "She's my sister. Jeralt adopted her a few years ago." </p><p> </p><p>That prompted a small smile from him. "Today is just full of surprises I see." </p><p> </p><p>"Professor, there you are!" Blinking, Byleth turned to see Leonie and Petra approaching her. </p><p> </p><p>"Is something up?"</p><p> </p><p>"Not really, we were just wondering if you saw where Claude or Edelgard went?" Leonie asked, glancing at Aelfric for a moment before focusing on her again. "Claude mentioned something about seeing someone suspicious appear out of nowhere, so he dragged Edelgard off with him." </p><p> </p><p>"Linhardt and Hilda have also vanished, so we were having hopes you saw them." </p><p> </p><p>"Are they missing?" Byleth asked, some worry for the students coming up through her muted emotions. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, I think I might know what might have happened," Aelfic spoke up, "There's a chance they might have stumbled upon Abyss." </p><p> </p><p>"Abyss?" Leonie repeated, raising an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>"Perhaps it would be better if we hurried along, Byleth," Aelfric said, getting Byleth to nod before Leonie spoke again. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, I don't know what this Abyss thing is, but I'm not letting the captain's daughter go off with some random stranger!" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, as her student, I shall be protecting her while she is injured," Petra firmly stated. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh dear…Byleth, perhaps we should just have these two accompany us to save time?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, that sounds good." Byleth said, nodding, before a thought occurred, “Hm…we should bring a Blue Lion.”</p><p> </p><p>Aelfric blinked. “Pardon?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, to balance things out. We have a church person–” She pointed to him, before gesturing to Leonie and Petra. “–a Golden Deer and a Black Eagle. We should get a Blue Lion so we’ll have all four.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I have understanding,” Petra said, nodding to the professor’s logic while Leonie raised an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, I don’t get how that’s supposed to make sense. Though…hm, I guess I haven’t checked if any of the Blue Lions are missing…" </p><p> </p><p>"In that case, we should check quickly," Byleth said, before leading the group to find a lion. One who they found rather quickly. "Oh, hello Dedue." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, professor, have you seen his Highness?" the young man from Duscur asked, worry evident in his voice. "I haven't seen him since yesterday." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, he's probably with Claude and Edelgard then," Byleth concluded, nodding, "We were just about to go see him. Did you want to come along?" </p><p> </p><p>"If it means finding his highness, of course." Dedue nodded. </p><p> </p><p>"All right, let's go," Byleth declared, pumping her fist, before turning to Aelfric, "Do you mind leading the way?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course not," the clergyman said with a smile, "Come along now, I'm sure my flock will be happy to see you." </p><p> </p><p>With that, they began to make their ways into the depths of Garreg Mach. Deep down, until the narrow passageways opened up into enormous caverns.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, this is crazy!” Leonie exclaimed as she looked around the massive ruins underneath the monastery, “There’s an entire village down here! How does no one know about this place?”</p><p> </p><p>“You would be surprised by the types of things the Church keeps secret,” Aelfric replied with a hint of amusement in his voice, “In comparison, Abyss is almost mild as far as hidden truths go. Some even say this city hidden beneath Garreg Mach existed before the monastery did and it was only later that the Church settled the mountains above.”</p><p> </p><p>“What, really? But that would make this place over a thousand years old, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Garreg Mach is a place of history, young lady. You shouldn’t be too surprised to see its history is a long one.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, the monastery is having a history of much longness,” Petra agreed, “It is like the ruins in my homeland, where the ancient spirits are resting.”</p><p> </p><p>"This place does seem to hold an ancient air to it," Dedue muttered as he glanced around for any sign of Dimitri. </p><p> </p><p>Aelfric smiled at the conversation. “Indeed, the history of this place really is fascinating. I would like to share more of what I know, but we really should be on our way–”</p><p> </p><p>“Hold on.” Byleth stopped and held up a hand, making the group pause.</p><p> </p><p>“Byleth? What is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Aelfric, what’s that big structure?” she asked, gesturing towards a large building they were coming close to.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I believe it was once a reception hall, though it wasn’t long ago it saw use as an underground arena,” the cardinal explained, “It should be abandoned now though.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. I just saw a heavily armed group enter through that entrance.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Oh. Ah, perhaps it is less abandoned than I expected…”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Dedue, Petra, to the front with me. Leonie, you can keep Aelfric safe, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Ah, yeah, I definitely can, though are you sure you should be taking the lead?” the orange-haired student asked, visibly worried. “I’m willing to admit you’re pretty tough, but aren’t you still injured?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m healed enough,” Byleth stated, before drawing the Sword of the Creator and heading for the arena.</p><p> </p><p>“...Did you have that under your coat this whole time?”</p><hr /><p>“You know, I’m starting to think we should have brought more people,” Claude commented as he loosed an arrow into another merc’s head.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Perhaps,” Edelgard replied, catching a mercenary’s sword on her shield before splitting his skull with her axe, “Though you were the one who insisted on the three of us going right away.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I didn’t realize our new friends would be ambushing this many mercs at once!” He nocked another arrow, aimed, and fired straight into the back of an assassin trying to creep up on Hilda, who was busy carving her own bloody swathe through the baddies along with that childhood friend of hers. “Besides, we did at least get some of our pals on our side!”</p><p> </p><p>“True, Lindhart has been surprisingly helpful for once,” Edelgard commented. She bashed her shield into an armored merc and drove its side into his neck, crushing his throat between the steel and the floor. “Who else would you have brought along, had you had the chance?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm, good question…honestly speaking? I think I actually got the team I’d pick for myself with Hilda and Shez here. Maybe I’d bring the rest of the Deer, but for a three person team, I think we’d be doing great!” He punctuated his statement by loosing another arrow, this one sailing across the arena to catch an assassin in the wrist before he could try to stab Dimitri. “And hey, at least we got Ashe from the Lions. He’s probably one of the better options aside from Shez.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard huffed in some amusement. “Yes, I have noticed you tend to favor Professor Eisner’s sister. Ashe is one of the ‘better options’ though?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sure, I’m always in favor of having another archer around. Volleys go a lot better when you can blot the sky out with arrows. Having Ignatz and Leonie is pretty good for that kind of thing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I see. I admit though–” Edelgard moved to block an arrow before it could catch Claude in the side, then ducked her head so her fellow house leader could shoot the archer in question right in the eye. “–I am curious who you consider the best options out of the Lions.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm…Shez is at the top, for sure, then I think Ashe works just fine. Dedue’s got that big guy appeal going for him, can’t go wrong with a solid wall of muscle, but he’s also super loyal to Dimitri so that means he’s a package deal with him. Then I guess it’s a toss up with the lancers and the casters. All of them can be effective in different ways, but my opinion varies a bit. I guess out of them I’d go for Ingrid first? She’s kind of a stick in the mud, but there’s some fun to be had there.” He considered things while looking across the battlefield, a slight smile coming to his face as he tracked Shez slicing her way through a squad of enemy mercs. “Oh, and the worst is definitely Felix.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? What’s so bad about Felix?”</p><p> </p><p>“Have you heard how he talks to Ingrid and Dedue? Guy’s a prick. I have no idea how the rest of the Faerghus Four are friends with him, but I feel like it’s just inertia by this point, like they liked him once upon a time and those good memories keep them hanging around–”</p><p> </p><p>“Look alive, people!” Yuri called out from his own spot in the fray, his sword darting out and cutting through the legion of mercs they were having to deal with. Their newest maybe-friend was still going strong from all appearances, barely looking winded as he split a man’s chest with his sword. “It looks like one more wave is incoming!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, great, just what we needed,” Claude complained, earning an amused noise from Edelgard.</p><p> </p><p>“And here I was getting invested in your opinions on our classmates.”</p><p> </p><p>“Heh, then ask me about them again after this, I’ve got plenty to share!”</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell is this!?” the mercenary in the lead exclaimed once he saw the gore-stained arena. His jaw dropped, but he shook it off quickly, before pointing his sword towards the two house leaders. “Damn it, if this is a trap, we’re turning it around! Go for the important-looking brats–”</p><p> </p><p>And then the upper half of his body exploded into flames, prompting panicked shouts among his cohorts that were rather quickly cut off by a whip-like sword shredding through a good amount of their number. The ones that weren’t didn’t far much better though as some familiar faces came in and promptly started cleaving through throats and chests with a sword and an axe.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that Petra and Dedue?” Claude asked, raising an eyebrow at the sight of his fellow students.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that the professor?!” Edelgard exclaimed, her own focus fully on the sight of her teacher appearing out of nowhere to carve through several mercenaries at once. Which was understandable since she really should be resting.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s probably why that guy exploded.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah–Oh, true, that would make sense.”</p><p> </p><p>“Friends of yours?” Yuri asked, prompting glances from his fellow house leaders as he appeared right beside them.</p><p> </p><p>“Yup,” Claude replied, unphased, “Blue-haired lady is one of our professors and the other two are our classmates–Oh hey, Leonie’s there too.”</p><p> </p><p>“She is?” Edelgard frowned, trying to catch sight of the redhead before nodding as she saw the commoner in question stab through a mercenary with her lance. “So she is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Heh, looks like we really are getting that back up I wanted. So hey, Yuri, do you mind letting your friends know not to kill our friends?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sure, the more the merrier. Hey, Wolves! The three ladies and the large man down that way are on our side!” he called out, catching the attention of his own “classmates”.</p><p> </p><p>“We have reinforcements? Since when?” Hapi asked, staying by Ashe as she and the archer provided covering fire. Or covering darkness, in Hapi’s case.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? So some good samaritans have come to our aid then! Ahaha, fortune truly favors us!” Constance declared, prompting a sigh from Linhardt as he tried to keep the crazy mage between him and the enemy.</p><p> </p><p>“What was that about hot ladies coming to save us?” Balthus asked, right in the middle of crushing the windpipe of a mercenary he had in a chokehold.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard sighed. “Well, this should be…interesting.”</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, you make it sound like we’re gonna make a bad first impression, princess,” Yuri teased, grinning, “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure everyone’s on their best behavior once we finish up here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Somehow, I doubt that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Phew, it looks like we’re reaching a lull in the–Is that Dedue?!?” Dimitri exclaimed as he came up to his fellow house leaders, his eyes widening in shock as he noticed his retainer smashing his way through armored mercenaries.</p><p> </p><p>"Bit slow on the uptake there, Dimitri," Claude responded. "Though I suppose our sudden saviors are probably the best surprise we'll get–" </p><p> </p><p>“You pieces of shit, you killed all of my men!” shouted a mercenary captain, visibly seething beneath his assassin’s helm as he caught the house leaders’ attention, “I might go down here, but I’ll take you with–!”</p><p> </p><p>And that was when a leaping horse landed straight on top of the merc, demonstrating to all the students there what it looked like when a warhorse’s hooves made contact with a man’s head, which was quite similar to seeing a melon smashed with a warhammer.</p><p> </p><p>“THE DEATH HORSE RIDES FREE ONCE MORE!” declared the Death Knight upon his steed, his black horse rearing up with a bloodthirsty whinny, “THE SCENT OF FRESH BLOOD HAS DRAWN ME TO THIS PLACE! WHO SHALL THE WORMS FEAST UPON TONI–AH.”</p><p> </p><p>Then he noticed the house leaders.</p><p> </p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>"..."</p><p> </p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>“...Is he also a friend of yours?” Yuri asked, glancing at the students while the princess of the group was fully glaring at her absolute idiot of a subordinate.</p><p> </p><p>“...” It was a little hard to tell, but Claude was pretty sure he could see sweat dripping down the Death Knight’s helmet. “...IT APPEARS…THAT THE TIME IS NOT YET RIGHT FOR MY SCYTHE TO CLAIM YOUR LIVES. BYE.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Well I was about to say that was the worst surprise but now that was just the weirdest." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard pinched the bridge of her nose as the Death Knight vanished. “Honestly, what a nuisance…”</p><p> </p><p>“Not normally how I’d describe a hulking knight in a skull helmet who nearly killed my professor, but you’re not wrong,” Claude commented, “Speaking of, hey Teach!”</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, there you are." Byleth said, quite casually as she cut the throat of a remaining mercenary. "Who's your friend?" </p><p> </p><p>"The name's Yuri, I'm in charge of the little band down here. Am I correct in assuming you're Shez’s sister?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, nice to meet-"</p><p> </p><p>"By!? What are you doing down here!?" Shez shouted, having approached the group right after the fighting stopped. "You should be in bed!"</p><p> </p><p>"You really should be resting, Professor," Edelgard agreed. </p><p> </p><p>"I dunno, she looks fine to me," Yuri contradicted. </p><p> </p><p>"No sense in making her leave if she's already here," Claude agreed in turn. </p><p> </p><p>"How about we head back to the town before we continue this discussion?" Dimitri suggested before the argument could start. </p><p> </p><p>"That sounds like a good idea,” Byleth agreed, “Though we should make sure Aelfric doesn't get left behind." </p><p> </p><p>“Aelfric is with you?” Yuri asked, a bit surprised as the clergyman jogged up to the group. </p><p> </p><p>“My apologies, I fell a tad behind there,” Aelfric said as he looked over the students, “Thank you for assisting my flock in their time of need.”</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, weird dude,” Shez spoke up, frowning, “Did you bring my sister down here?" </p><p> </p><p>"What did you just call Aelfric?!" Constance asked, agape at the audacity. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, please calm down," Aelfric said as he raised his hands. "And yes, I did. I wanted her to meet my flock." </p><p> </p><p>"And why exactly is that?" </p><p> </p><p>"Shez, calm down. He's a friend of Sitri and Jeralt." </p><p> </p><p>"...oh. okay, sorry about that," Shez apologized, backing off. </p><p> </p><p>"It's alright, I can appreciate how protective you are of your sister,” Aelfric replied with a smile. "Though I hope you're okay with us showing her the town." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, sure, okay," Shez huffed, looking neither sure nor okay with that suggestion.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you. In that case, I hope you don't mind if I ask you a favor, professor," Aelfric said as he smiled, catching Byleth’s attention.</p><hr /><p>So, apparently Aelfric wanted Byleth to help teach the Ashen Wolves. She didn't particularly mind that favor really, as she was ready to start teaching again, so what were four more students? Well, technically five since Marianne just joined her class… hm, should she try recruiting from other classes? She liked the idea of having more students… </p><p> </p><p>Though, that thought took a backseat as she began to look around the Abyss, checking in on the students that she brought with her. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey By, come on, you really should go back to get some rest." While also trying not to be annoyed by Shez. She couldn't really blame her, since she had acted the same after Shez had almost died against Lonato, but still. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm fine Shez. My wounds don't even hurt anymore." </p><p> </p><p>"...I kinda want to poke you to prove that they still do hurt, but I also don't want to hurt you." </p><p> </p><p>"Then I guess you just have to be okay with me being down here," Byleth responded, getting Shez to huff as they walked around. Their first stop being a scrap pile. </p><p> </p><p>"Woah, guys, look at this!" Leonie cried out from the scrap heap. "Who threw this away!?" she asked, holding up a dented hexshield. </p><p> </p><p>"Eh, you'd be surprised at what people throw away," Balthus commented as Leonie kept digging through the heap. </p><p> </p><p>"But that's a hexshield! I could scrape together money for a year and still not have enough coin for one! It's not even badly dented!" Leonie yelled, before pulling out a lance. "This isn't even in bad condition, it's just really rusted! This can easily be fixed!" </p><p> </p><p>"Eesh, I don't think even anyone down here is this excited about the scrap heap," Balthus muttered before glancing at Byleth. "Well, as you can see, this is the scrap heap. Any gear that gets thrown away topside ends up here, and you can usually find something good down here."</p><p> </p><p>"Good to know. It definitely seems useful." </p><p> </p><p>Shez huffed, amused this time. "Pft, looking to get something new to replace that sword you have, By?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, but it's still handy to know about." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, sometimes you find something in good condition that's worth a decent amount of gold,” Balthus added, “Always handy to have when I need some booze." </p><p> </p><p>"...Hm." Byleth nodded to herself. "I'm going to see how everyone else is doing." Turning on her feet, Byleth headed out, with Shez following behind her. “You don’t need to follow me.”</p><p> </p><p>“What, I can’t hang out with my sister?” Shez replied, acting casual despite how obvious it was that she was still keeping an eye on Byleth, “Besides, I can be your guide down here!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, alright. I didn’t realize you knew that much about Abyss.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh totally! I know everything there is to know about the abyss! In fact–Oh, hey, haven’t been in there before,” she commented before heading off towards what looked like a library.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth sighed at her sister’s antics, but followed along to find her hanging out with Claude.</p><p> </p><p>“They have forbidden books down here?” Shez asked, looking at the tome Claude was holding.</p><p> </p><p>“That they do, Shez, that they do. It looks like anything the church bans winds up down here. Pretty convenient for me, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, really convenient. Though you’re probably gonna get in trouble if you try to bring any back up with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s only if I get caught with them.”</p><p> </p><p>Well there was only one thing for Byleth to do after hearing that, which was heading right over and taking the book Claude had in his hands away from him.</p><p> </p><p>“Wha–Aw, c’mon Teach, you don't trust me?”</p><p> </p><p>“I trust you. I just find it funny to catch you off guard.” Claude blinked at that frank admission before Byleth turned the book over in her hands. “Huh, no title.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ooo, a mystery book,” Shez said, staring curiously at the blank cover and earning a chuckle from Claude.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it looks like a fair few of these are damaged. Soooo, would you mind giving that back so I can try to find out what it is?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth ignored him and opened the book up herself. </p><p> </p><p>"...’How to compliment a lover’." </p><p> </p><p>Claude blinked. “Huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Shez, meanwhile, glanced at her friend with a slight grin. “Oh? You’re interested in that kind of stuff, Claude?”</p><p> </p><p>"No I'm not!" Claude argued, almost reflexively from what it seemed. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth tried not to smile. It was a bit more difficult than usual. "Hm…you know, just because you're trying to court Shez doesn't mean you should read a book about pick up lines." </p><p> </p><p>"PFTT!" Shez started laughing loudly at that, holding her gut as she doubled over in laughter. "A-Aw~! Does his highness have a crush on me~?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hey now, I'm not Lysithea," Claude deflected, immediately throwing his fellow Deer under the carriage without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>“Pft, oh please, Lysithea doesn’t have a crush on me,” Shez replied, waving the suggestion off, “She’s just teaching me magic. I mean, I guess she’s my buddy? But yeah, there’s no crush there.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth sighed, sharing an exasperated look with Claude before she returned the book to its place on the bookshelf and picked out a different one. “Hm…Claude, I think most of these are books on dating.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Seriously?” Claude frowned as he went over to the shelves and started looking through, his frown getting deeper before he abruptly shut the book he was reading. “...Right, going to be awkward going into that room with the saint statues now…”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Why’s that?” Shez asked, moving over to look at the book Claude had, though he tossed it to Byleth before Shez could get it. “Ah–Hey! C’mon, I wanted to read that!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, no, you didn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth, meanwhile, opened up the book, read a few lines, then placed it back on the shelf…before she casually picked out one that looked more interesting and slipped it into her coat before Shez would notice. </p><p> </p><p>"I can see why so many of these books were banned," Byleth said, "Try not to stick around here, Claude." </p><p> </p><p>"Fine fine," Claude muttered, shaking his head as Byleth and Shez left.</p><p> </p><p>"So… Lysithea is teaching you magic?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, she's pretty skilled at dark magic, so it's nice having someone help me out with that!" Shez explained with a grin. "Though, like I said, she doesn't have a crush on me." </p><p> </p><p>"And if she did?" Byleth asked, deciding to needle Shez in return for all her previous teasing. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…huh…Well, she's cute. You know, like an angry rabbit. Though she's also a noble, so not sure how well being a traveling merc will help with dating someone who has to stay somewhere." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…so she's cute, huh?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Oh you are not turning this around on me." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm just repeating what you said," Byleth said, a small grin on her face as she walked ahead of Shez, looking for the other students. </p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, they didn't have to go far as they found Dedue and Dimitri talking with one another. </p><p> </p><p>"Your highness, I must ask that you not go on such a dangerous mission without letting me accompany you." </p><p> </p><p>"My apologies Dedue, I had no idea it would be so dangerous to begin with. As it is, I only intended to follow Claude to see what exactly he had seen." </p><p> </p><p>"It was still dangerous. You should have gotten more back up," Byleth said, getting their attention. </p><p> </p><p>"I understand that, professor. Still, at least things turned out well?" </p><p> </p><p>"Thankfully." </p><p> </p><p>"I owe you some gratitude as well, professor. Thank you for bringing me along on this mission," Dedue said, bowing to her. </p><p> </p><p>"No need to thank me," Byleth replied as she nodded to him. "Just make sure to keep an eye on him." </p><p> </p><p>"I can take care of myself, professor," Dimitri responded, mostly in good humor. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure." Byleth nodded to him too before walking off with a silent Shez in tow. "You're being quiet." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yeah, it's just…a bit awkward is all. Since I'm planning on transferring out." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…did you want to talk about it?" </p><p> </p><p>"I mean, what's there to talk about? I'm not enjoying it as much as I would like, so I figured the Golden Deer would be a better choice." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…Well, if that's what you want to do." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, guess I lucked out by being the student instead of the professor huh? I get the option to leave, rather than stay like you gotta." </p><p> </p><p>"...I guess so. Still, I think I'd stick with the Black Eagles even if I had the option. It was… rough at the start, but I enjoy being with them. I've helped them and they helped me." </p><p> </p><p>"Really?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah…It’s thanks to Edelgard that I was able to…at the very least confront my issues with Catherine. I don't know if we're friends, but at the very least, I know I have a ways to go before I can fight her again." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…well, that explains that…" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. Also, interesting that you're joining the class that Claude and Lysithea are in." </p><p> </p><p>"By, I swear to the goddess-" </p><p> </p><p>"I'm just pointing that out. And also how Leonie, your rival, is also in the class. Not to mention Hilda, who you apparently called adorable." </p><p> </p><p>"...You're really lucky you're injured right now or I'd punch you." </p><p> </p><p>“Aw.” Byleth pouted. “My baby sister is being so mean to her poor, injured older sister. How cruel.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” That twitch was new. “You know, maybe I’ll just join the Wolves instead and live underground for the rest of my school year.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, I’ll make sure to tell papa. Try to get some sun or you’ll get pale.”</p><p> </p><p>“...You could at least pretend to entertain the idea.”</p><p> </p><p>“No. Besides–”</p><p> </p><p>"–I forgive you, ahahaha!" Turning her head towards the loud laugh that caught her attention, Byleth saw Constance standing by Edelgard and Petra. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, excuse me?" Petra asked, seemingly very confused. </p><p> </p><p>"There is no need for you to be excused!" </p><p> </p><p>"What's going on?" Byleth asked as she approached the group. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh hello, Professor Byleth, correct? Allow me to properly introduce myself! My name is Constance von Nuvelle!" the blonde Ashen Wolf declared as she fanned herself. "I must thank you again for coming to our rescue!" </p><p> </p><p>“She didn’t do much,” Shez muttered, but Byleth ignored that.</p><p> </p><p>"Just glad I could help, but what’s going on here?" </p><p> </p><p>"If I can explain, I believe Constance is trying to say she bears no ill will to Petra for what happened during the Dagda and Brigid war,” Edelgard suggested. </p><p> </p><p>“And I don’t! If I am to restore House Nuvelle, then I cannot be stuck in the past mired with grudges!” Constance stated. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some spells I must practice!” Turning on her heel, Constance walked away. </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, wait!” Petra called out, following behind her, leaving Edelgard alone with the sisters.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Professor, are you sure you should be walking around?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m good, I’m already healed up,” Byleth said, pouting a bit at how much people kept trying to get her to rest. </p><p> </p><p>“Nah, you’ve got the right idea, your highness! By definitely shouldn’t be walking around like this!” Shez declared, clapping a hand to her sister’s shoulder, “She’s so frail and weak right now, she should really just lay down and let her super strong sister handle everything for her–GH!”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth lowered her elbow from where she’d rammed it into her sister’s stomach. “I’m fine, like I said.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Very well… Professor, while I have you here, I did want to ask you something.” At her nod, Edelgard continued. “You’ve traveled across Fodlan before, correct? I wanted to know if you could tell me about your travels, perhaps after you left Enbarr?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, is this about the Dagda and Brigid War?” Shez asked, “By mentioned she talked to Petra about it before, so I think we’re cool on that front? Hm, maybe I should talk to her too?</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard paused, not expecting that response. “...It wasn’t exactly what I was thinking of, but you were a combatant in that war?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sure! Well, kind of? I hung back since I got stabbed, so Byleth was on more missions there.”</p><p> </p><p>“Our mercenary band was hired by Count Varley to protect his territory during it, before Count Bergliez counter-attacked,” Byleth elaborated, “We mostly hunted down scouting parties that made it past the mountains though. That and the occasional band of deserters. Like Shez said, I talked with Petra about it before.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm, I see. Yes, I suppose you would want to discuss the subject with her…May I ask what you did after that though?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth tilted her head, thinking. “We went west through the mountains, then up into Faerghus.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard nodded as though Byleth just confirmed something for her. “Understood. Thank you, professor, for satisfying my curiosity.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s all you wanted to know?” Shez asked, “Would’ve thought you’d be asking for something more interesting than that.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard shrugged. “I was just curious. I doubt your journey had anything of interest after that point.” An interesting look came to her eyes. “Was there?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…well Byleth learned light magic, that was pretty cool. Uh…then I guess we went to Faerghus after that? Which sucked, it’s super cold up there.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I can’t say I’m too fond of the Faerghus cold either,” Edelgard murmured.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you’ve been up there too, princess?”</p><p> </p><p>“Some years ago, yes. It was…well, perhaps I will tell the story later. For now, weren’t you checking on everyone, professor?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right. See you later then,” Byleth said before heading off once more with Shez in tow, the younger mercenary still sticking close to make sure her sister was okay. The last of her students to find would be Linhardt, and he was bound to be either studying something or napping, which meant he would probably be in the library…but she was just there and only saw Claude, so hm. Where was her sleepy student?</p><p> </p><p>In front of a pagan altar, apparently.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hello professor. And Shez too,” Linhardt off-handedly greeted, busy staring up at the huge statue of a winged goddess, “I must say, it is fascinating to see a statue like this directly beneath what most would consider the home of Fodlan’s own goddess. I wonder if that would make our friend here a trespasser or a guest?”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably a guest, yeah?” Shez said while Byleth idly studied the statue, “I don’t think the goddess minds if another god decides to relax in her basement.”</p><p> </p><p>“You have a more tolerant view of faith than most, Shez. Still, it is a shame we have no easy access to knowledge regarding the gods of other lands. The Church may say there are no true gods but the Goddess herself, yet other lands often worship entire pantheons. It raises questions, don’t you think?”</p><p> </p><p>“Careful there, friend. It might be fine to ask questions like that down here, but you’ll probably get accused of blasphemy if you ask similar things up top,” Yuri chided as he walked over to them with a faint grin on his face. “And I’d hate to lose a friend so soon after meeting them.” </p><p> </p><p>“But something like this is far too fascinating to just keep to myself. I wonder if I could find some texts on who this god is…” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure you can find something. Plenty of secrets tend to squirrel themselves away down here.” He turned his gaze towards Byleth with a faint smile. “I'm sure you have your own that you want to keep." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged in response. "I guess. Hey, do you know where Hilda or Ashe are?" </p><p> </p><p>"Can't say anything about the young boy, but as for the Goneril girl, I believe I saw her visiting the wayseer. She certainly seemed interested when she learned what exactly she does.” Tilting her head in confusion, Byleth went to where he gestured, before finding Hilda sitting at a table where a cloaked woman had her hands over a crystal ball. </p><p> </p><p>“Oooh, that’s definitely going to be blackmail material~”</p><p> </p><p>“What is?” Byleth asked, getting Hilda to look at her. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh hey there Professor, Shez!" Hilda greeted them as she looked back on them. "You'll get a kick out of this, this lady can see how close people are!" </p><p> </p><p>"She can?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, well, specifically she can see who's closest to someone. Oh, can you check to see who the professor is closest to?" Hilda asked the seer, who let out a sigh before focusing on her crystal ball. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…it seems she is closest to her sister." </p><p> </p><p>"Pft, I could have told you that," Shez said with a grin. </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, that's no fun,” Hilda complained, pouting, “How can I tease her about that?" </p><p> </p><p>"...You know I can hear you, right?" Byleth asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh well, at least I have something to tease Shez about," Hilda said with a sigh, as she hid a smirk. </p><p> </p><p>"What are you talking about?" Shez asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh you know, I decided to ask who your 'mentor' is closest to~" </p><p> </p><p>"Huh?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh?" Byleth seemed very intrigued all of a sudden, which made Shez pause. </p><p> </p><p>"...H-Hey, I already said she didn't have a crush on me!" </p><p> </p><p>"Really~?" Hilda asked in a teasing tone, catching Shez off guard. Looking between the two, Shez felt her face begin to burn, before she took off running. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm… feels nice turning the tables on her," Byleth said, nodding to herself. "Make sure to take care, Hilda." </p><p> </p><p>"Sure thing, professor!" </p><p> </p><p>Walking out, Byleth began to look for Shez before she could get lost, only to find Ashe speaking with Hapi. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, hello there Professor Byleth, how are you feeling?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'm doing okay, have either of you seen Shez?" </p><p> </p><p>"Nope, and do you mind getting this kid to stop bothering me?" Hapi said, getting Ashe to look sheepish. </p><p> </p><p>"A-Ah, I was just curious as to why she can apparently summon demonic beasts by sighing. Though I guess it's something personal." </p><p> </p><p>"It is." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, sorry to bother you Hapi. Ashe, we should meet up with everyone else." </p><p> </p><p>"Right, professor!" Ashe said, giving an apologetic smile to Hapi as they walked away. "Also, did Shez go somewhere?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, hopefully not. She might get lost easily down here, and who knows what's down here."</p><hr /><p>"...Well shit, where am I?" Shez asked, looking around as she realized she might have gone too deep into Abyss. </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe don't go running down several hallways in the underground town next time,” Arval suggested as they appeared behind her. </p><p> </p><p>"Well what was I supposed to do?" Shez asked as she tried to backtrack her way out. </p><p> </p><p>"Don't get flustered over the possibility of someone having a crush on you?" </p><p> </p><p>"Easy for you to say." </p><p> </p><p>"It is, and it should be for you as well. You don't have a crush on her, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"I don't. I mean she's my friend and all, but… I dunno, I've read stuff involving romance before, I just never thought I'd actually have to deal with stuff like that," Shez muttered as she kept walking. </p><p> </p><p>"Well get used to it, or else your sister will begin to tease you about it, and I refuse to allow you to lose purely from embarrassment," Arval responded, before Shez walked into a wide open room. </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, I think we're getting somewhere," Shez said as she looked around. Though it was still creepy with how quiet things were down here… </p><p> </p><p>"Anyone there?" Shez called out, getting no response. "Ugh… Seriously, how big is this place?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Partner." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? What's up Arval?" Shez asked, glancing up at the spirit, who wordlessly lifted an arm to point somewhere in the dark. Following their arm, Shez saw what they were pointing at. </p><p> </p><p>In a strangely illuminated part of the room, a body lay down on a stone table. The woman, wearing a white gown, her long green hair spilling out around her head, seemed to be resting, as if she could wake up at any moment. And…the more she looked at her, the more Shez saw the similarities between the strange woman and…her sister. </p><p> </p><p>“What the hell…?”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Oh, there you are, Professor," Edelgard greeted as Byleth walked up. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, have you seen Shez?" Byleth asked, getting Edelgard to blink in surprise. </p><p> </p><p>"No? I thought she was with you." </p><p> </p><p>"She was, but I can't find her." </p><p> </p><p>"Eh, Shez is a strong girl, I’m sure she can take care of herself," Claude said.</p><p> </p><p>"...That is true, but she has also admitted to getting lost easily," Dimitri responded. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, that isn't good…perhaps while you go on your mission, I can look around for her?" Aelfric asked, getting Byleth’s attention. </p><p> </p><p>"Mission?" </p><p> </p><p>"We’re going looking for what we think those mercenaries are after." Yuri answered. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes! While we cannot say for certain, our dear Aelfric has informed us of a legend that they might be seeking," Constance stated, "The fabled Chalice of Beginnings, said to have the power to raise the dead!"</p><p> </p><p>"Hm. Well, okay,” Byleth accepted, “Good luck with that. I'm going to try and find Shez." </p><p> </p><p>"You're not going with us?" Balthus asked. </p><p> </p><p>"It would be best to find her before she gets truly lost," Dedue noted. </p><p> </p><p>"In that case, I shall go with the professor! None are as good at tracking as I!" Petra declared.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, I don't know how good Brigid hunters are, but don't underestimate my tracking skills!" Leonie cut in with a grin, earning a challenging smirk from Petra in reply. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, sticking around here does sound like it's not as much of a hassle…" Hapi muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"I volunteer to stay in the town in case Shez comes wandering back!" Hilda said, eager to not put in the effort. </p><p> </p><p>"Seconded," Lindhart said with a yawn. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, I don't know how well splitting the group will be," Aelfric said. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure? I mean, there's so many of us, that I'm sure we can cover both objectives easily," Ashe responded, getting Aelfric to frown. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm… it would mean some of us are here in case any more Mercenaries attack," Edelgard muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, don't worry, I can-" And before Byleth could assure the protection of the Abyss, a loud yell cut her off. </p><p> </p><p>"BY!" Shez shouted, as she came running up. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, there you are-..." Byleth couldn't help but trail off as she saw what her sister was running up with. Namely a body in her arms. </p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing with Sitri!?” Aelfric exclaimed, which earned him a lot of surprised stares.</p><p> </p><p>“Sitri? Who’s Sitri?” Claude asked.</p><p> </p><p>“My mother…” Byleth murmured, stunned, before moving closer to Shez. Aelfric took a half-step towards her too, but stopped himself while Byleth stared at the body of her mother. “How did…Why is she down here? She should be buried at the monastery…”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know! It’s insane, right?” Shez agreed, looking about as baffled as most of the students felt, “I just found her down here and she looked so much like you and I don’t even get why she’d be here??" </p><p> </p><p>"I don't either…" Byleth said, staring as she felt… something ache in her. </p><p> </p><p>"...Ah, perhaps we should find somewhere to lay her down for now?" Aelfric suggested, trying to figure out what to do for his plan. </p><p> </p><p>"f I may, Aelfric, you seemed surprised that Shez had the Professor’s mother," Edelgard spoke up, staring at the monk. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, yes, why wouldn't I be?" </p><p> </p><p>"It was your specific wording. Normally one would be surprised at seeing the body of someone they thought passed away long ago, rather than ask what someone was doing with them." </p><p> </p><p>"You better not be accusing Aelfric of something," Balthus interrupted, cracking his knuckles with a glare. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey now, I'm not saying Edelgard is right, but it is suspicious, especially since Aelfric is supposed to be in charge down here," Claude noted. </p><p> </p><p>Constance scoffed. "I refuse to listen to such baseless accusations!"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, Elfie isn't a bad person," Hapi agreed.</p><p> </p><p>“Everyone, please, be at peace!” Aelfric interrupted, holding up his hands to ward off any violence as the groups of students started to square off, “Please, all I did was misspeak–”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a pretty shoddy excuse,” Claude pointed out with a faint smirk, keeping his eyes on the Wolves, who bristled at his comment.</p><p> </p><p>As the tension continued to grow, Byleth silently stood by Shez, before reaching out to hold her mother. Concern evident on her face, Shez handed her over. </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth couldn’t think of what to say as she stared down at her mother. All she could do was stare at her, looking like she was resting peacefully. And the next thing she knew, drops of water seemed to fall upon Sitri's face. Concern filled Byleth as she knelt down to try and clean off Sitri's face. </p><p> </p><p>"...Byleth," Shez said, getting her sister’s attention as she knelt down too. Reaching up, Shez wiped the tears off her sister's face, before pulling her into a hug. </p><p> </p><p>Nearby, the tension seemed to fade away as the sound of Byleth crying caught the attention of everyone. </p><p> </p><p>"...Shez, perhaps you should take the professor and her mother up to the monastery," Edelgard suggested, getting Shez to silently nod as she stood back up. </p><p> </p><p>"W-Wait, I don't know if it's a good idea to take her," Aelfric cut in, trying to stop them. </p><p> </p><p>"...Yes, perhaps we should figure out why exactly she is down here," Yuri said. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't care about that," Shez responded, glaring at them. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure? I mean, she was supposedly buried, correct? Then someone must have dug her up, though the question is who would be debased enough to do so," Yuri said, a curious tone in his voice. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yes, to defile a grave is a horrible thing to do! Whoever did this, must pay for it!" Dimitri stated. </p><p> </p><p>"They're probably also perverse," Claude noted, “I mean really, what kind of freak would dig up a lady just to keep her around? Sounds like a real sicko.” </p><p> </p><p>"I-I am not! I didn't even dig her up, I found her down here!" Aelfric shouted, immediately realizing his mistake as everyone stared at him. </p><p> </p><p>"...Aelfric?" Constance broke the silence, staring at him in disbelief. "Please tell me you misspoke there as well." </p><p> </p><p>"Well he obviously did misspeak. He said too much there," Claude commented with a smug smirk. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, you shut up!" Balthus shouted, before he turned to face Aelfric. "Come on, Aelfric, he's wrong, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"...” Aelfric wracked his mind for an excuse, another option beside admitting the truth…and couldn’t come up with anything. “Ten years ago, I found her body down here. I didn't dig her up, I swear to the goddess that I would never do that to Sitri."</p><p> </p><p>"Why didn't you tell anyone!?" Ashe asked, completely taken aback. </p><p> </p><p>"Who was I supposed to tell?! I…after Sitri passed away all those years ago, I lost my trust in Rhea. And to suddenly find her body down here even though she was supposed to be buried? How could I ever talk about that?" </p><p> </p><p>"You could have at least… buried her or something," Hilda muttered, unsure of what else to say. </p><p> </p><p>"There are several methods of funeral rites," Petra said, agreeing with Hilda. </p><p> </p><p>"It may not be my place to speak, but you should have at least told the professor," Dedue spoke up as he stared down at the monk. </p><p> </p><p>"How could I have explained this to her? Sitri…she died twenty years ago, and yet it's like not a single day has passed…" </p><p> </p><p>"It's still her mom! Her and the captain have the right to decide what to do with her!" Leonie shouted. </p><p> </p><p>"...I was weak. I found a body that seemed… almost perfectly preserved down here and… I was afraid that if I touched her, she might have crumbled away. Hence why I left her there. I even set up wards that were supposed to guide people away from her." Aelfric sighed, trying to keep up the lie as he glanced at Shez. "I guess they weren't as effective as I thought." </p><p> </p><p>"...Yeah, sure. Look, I don't care what kinda reasons you have, but Byleth and I are leaving, and we're taking missus Sitri with us," Shez said, keeping a protective arm around Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"That…" Aelfric tried to think of what to say. </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me, but weren't you just telling us about the chalice of the beginnings? An item that could supposedly raise the dead?" Lindhart asked, as he raised his hand. </p><p> </p><p>"...what?" Shez asked, having not heard of that. </p><p> </p><p>"I-I only heard about that legend! I never went out to seek it!" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, if Elfie was really looking for it, he would have asked us to help him find it or something." </p><p> </p><p>"I don't care," Byleth said, getting everyone's attention, "I don't care about what reason he had, or whatever this chalice is. I'm taking my mom, and I'm going to bury her." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Aelfric sighed, knowing he had lost. “Of course, I can allow that. Though, if I may, I would like to at least speak to Lady Rhea before you do. I understand I have been cowardly by not taking these steps before now, and I hope you can forgive me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pretty sure you should mention what happened to dad before you talk to Rhea,” Shez pointed out, still frowning at Aelfric.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, of course. I’ll make sure to let Jeralt know too. I owe him that much. But, please, I don’t think it would be a good idea to carry Sitri through the monastery as she is. At the very least…she should be prepared for burial.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Okay," Byleth said, frowning even as she agreed. "I'm… going to find somewhere to lay her down." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, the Ashen Wolves have our own makeshift dormitories, if that would work," Constance offered. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you," Byleth said, before following behind the blonde noble. </p><p> </p><p>Aelfric sighed, before steeling himself. "Yuri, if you would please keep an eye on everyone, I'll make sure to return as soon as I can." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course," Yuri accepted, nodding to Aelfric as the monk left. "Perhaps it would be best if we all took a moment to relax, lest the tension returns." </p><p> </p><p>"That sounds for the best," Edelgard agreed, before following behind the two sisters, though giving them some space as she waited outside the dormitories. Surprisingly, it wasn't Constance that walked out first, but Shez. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, hey there, princess," Shez greeted, giving her a slight wave. </p><p> </p><p>"Hello…how is the professor doing?" </p><p> </p><p>"...about as well as she can be, I guess," Shez muttered, "You mind doing me a favor? I'm going to be going on the monthly mission soon, so I won't be able to keep an eye on Byleth while I'm gone, so I was hoping you could help with that." </p><p> </p><p>"...Of course, if there is any way I can help, then I'll gladly do so." </p><p> </p><p>Shez smiled. "Heh, you know, I know it hasn't been that long, but thanks for being friends with Byleth."</p><p> </p><p>That gave Edelgard some pause. There just…wasn’t any hint of guile or deception in Shez’s voice. From all indications, she genuinely meant that. “...You are welcome. Though I will note that she is my professor and I am her student. We’re not exactly–”</p><p> </p><p>“Nah, you’re friends, I can tell. So, again, thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard huffed, a small smile of her own creeping up her face. “You are welcome. It's the least I can do after all she's done." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah, didn't she save your life when we first met?" Shez asked, before a grin spread on her face. "What, don't tell me you got a crush on her because of that?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I would appreciate you not mock me. I have no such feelings towards Professor Byleth." </p><p> </p><p>"Sure, sure. Just keep in mind, even if you're a princess, you gotta have my permission," Shez teased, getting Edelgard to huff. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, am I intruding in something?" Constance asked as she walked out. </p><p> </p><p>"Not at all," Edelgard said as she turned to her. "Is the professor okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course. I made sure she went to sleep since she looked absolutely exhausted," Constance stated before turning to Shez. "And I would like to offer my sincerest apologies for what Aelfric has done. If I was aware of what he kept hidden, I would have made him come forth about it." </p><p> </p><p>"...Look, no offense, but I don't know any of you guys. I don't know how much you do know, I'm sure you mean well, but you can see why I'm not going to trust you, alright?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, of course. In that case, I just have to show you the sincerity of House Nuvelle!" Constance declared, getting Shez to look confused at her sudden exuberance. </p><p> </p><p>"There you guys are." Looking over, the trio saw Hapi standing nearby. "Yuri said we should talk about what to do." </p><p> </p><p>"I thought we were going to wait for Aelfric to return?" Edelgard pointed out. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, but we still have to deal with those mercenaries. I'm not sure what exactly Elfie might have been planning, but those guys are still the immediate danger." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Shez let out a sigh. "Hey, Edelgard, do you mind sticking by my sister?" </p><p> </p><p>"You want me to stay by her? What about you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Look, I already said I don't trust these guys. So whatever they do, I'm keeping an eye on them. And I want to at least keep someone I trust keeping an eye on Byleth." </p><p> </p><p>"...Very well, I promise to keep her safe." Edelgard said, nodding to Shez. As they walked off, Edelgard entered the dormitory. Seeing her professor silently sleeping, she couldn't help but…contemplate her plans. Shez was an Agarthan, of that she was sure but… even so, it was clear Shez did love her sister…. </p><p> </p><p>If she was tricking her, Edelgard would make sure Shez paid for it, but for now, she wouldn't tell Bias what she learned. </p><hr /><p>Sometime later, Edelgard felt a yawn threaten to leave her mouth as she looked over her professor. It had been a long time since the expedition group had left, and while it was hard to keep track of time down here, it definitely felt like it was getting late. A part of her idly thought that Hubert was likely panicking at not being able to find her, before she was broken out of her thoughts by a tray of food being shoved in her face. </p><p> </p><p>Jolting backwards, Edelgard followed the tray to see Leonie smiling down at her. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey there, you really need to make sure to get something to eat." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, thank you, Leonie," Edelgard said, taking the tray from her, </p><p> </p><p>"No problem, just hope you don't mind that I made it. It's nothing fancy but it's filling," Leonie said as she sat down next to her. </p><p> </p><p>"It looks delicious," Edelgard complimented before she began to eat, almost immediately gagging as she did. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I did my best, but well, the food they have down here isn't great." </p><p> </p><p>"I-I see." Edelgard coughed slightly, trying to clear the taste. "I understand that this place might be a refuge for criminals and the like, but one would think that since it's still connected to the church, that they would at least have the funds for good food." </p><p> </p><p>"Eh, it's not that surprising. I mean, it's nice that the church gives us free food and all, but we still had to pay to come here. Hell, I'm going to be in debt for at least a few years after I graduate." </p><p> </p><p>That got Edelgard to blink in surprise. "You will?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, this place isn't cheap after all, and unlike Ignatz and Raphael, I'm not part of a merchant family. My entire village had to scrape the funds to send me here." </p><p> </p><p>"...I see." That was something Edelgard hadn't really thought about before. Given her own wealth of funds, it never occurred how much the entry fee would be to commoners. Really, most commoners would normally only be able to join if they had a noble patron…</p><p> </p><p>"Something up, Edelgard?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, no, you just gave me something to think about for my reforms for when I become emperor," Edelgard said, before looking around. "Where is Ashe?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh he's sitting outside. Cause it's apparently inappropriate for a guy to enter the girls dorm!" Leonie shouted, directing the last part to the door. </p><p> </p><p>"It is!" Ashe shouted back, getting Leonie to laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“Hahaha! Ah, anyways, how’s Byleth doing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Still asleep,” Edelgard replied, “I think she may have exhausted herself more than she expected with the combat earlier.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that sounds like her. She’s always been arro–ah, confident, as long as I’ve known her. I used to think it was some sense of superiority she had, the way she seemed so cool and collected all the time, but…” She scratched her head, letting out a sigh. “I guess I let my own ideas of what she’s like get away from me when I was younger.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. How long have you known the professor?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not that long. I just met her and her sister a few years ago. I was thirteen, I think Byleth was fourteen since she’s a year older, and Shez…I’m not actually sure? She’s always been kind of tall for a girl and it’s tricky to tell. If I asked Shez, she’d probably say she was fourteen too, or even fifteen, but Byleth would probably say she was eleven?” Leonie shrugged. “My point is, I mostly met them for a few days before they had to head out again. I liked Shez immediately because she saved me from some poachers that were attacking our town, and I didn’t like Byleth at all because she seemed super arrogant to me. I didn’t really get that she was just…I don’t know if there’s a word for it? Just, weird, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yeah, I get what you mean," Ashe said, having listened in from outside. "It's a bit different for me but… it's silly to think about now, but back when I first met Shez and Byleth, I thought of them as some invincible heroes cause of the stories Shez used to tell me and my siblings. After what happened to Christophe… it became obvious that they were just kids, like me. I never actually got to say goodbye to Byleth when she left, and…Shez just looked so worried about her when she said goodbye." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard hummed, considering matters. If Shez had been part of Jeralt’s Mercenaries since she was that young… "It is strange to think about them like that, but it's easy to forget that the two of them are our age, despite their years of experience." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, that's true. Heck, isn't Mercedes older than Byleth?" Leonie asked.</p><p> </p><p>"I think so, yes," Ashe confirmed. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…" Edelgard let out a small sigh as she got up, tray in hand since she had finished eating. "Well, I suppose that is something to-" Feeling something run over her foot, Edelgard was unable to keep the instinctive scream out of her mouth, practically flinging the tray out of her hands as she backed away from the rat that scurried across the floor. </p><p> </p><p>"What happened!?" Ashe yelled running in with his bow drawn as his eyes scanned the room.</p><p> </p><p>"M-My apologies. I just felt a r-rat scurry over my foot," Edelgard muttered, really wishing she had brought Whiskerton down with her. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, is that all? I thought you just really didn't like the food I made," Leonie joked, trying to ease Edelgard’s nerves with a laugh. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, at least it wasn't anything bad?" Ashe said, going over to grab the now dented tray. "I'm just glad that didn't wake the professor up." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh?" Confused, Edelgard glanced over to Byleth. That was…odd. She didn't know how exactly the professor slept, but one would think a mercenary would have awoken at a sudden loud banging of a metal tray hitting a stone wall. Yet, it looked as though she was still peacefully sleeping. </p><p> </p><p>"...Professor-" And before she could get any further, a loud scream from outside cut her off. </p><p> </p><p>"FIRE!" Instantly on guard, Edelgard rushed towards the door. </p><p> </p><p>"Both of you stay here!" Edelgard commanded as she went towards the source of the scream.</p><p> </p><p>A scowl came to her face as she spotted the raging fires that had begun to consume parts of Abyss. The ramshackle wooden buildings were lighting up quickly, catching like tinder as she spotted more mercenaries in rough armor, led by heavy knights in full plate.</p><p> </p><p>“RUN AWAY, LITTLE RATS!” one of the armored mercenaries yelled, the hammer in his hand smashing one of the town’s few guards off his feet, “DON’T THINK WE WON’T KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF–”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s fireball caught the distracted mercenary in the head in an eruption of flames and molten steel as he went from yelling to screaming. Edelgard didn’t slow though, drawing on the strength of her crest as she slammed her palm into his chest and cast another Fire, silencing his screams in an instant. </p><p> </p><p>“Wha–CAPTAIN!” another armored mercenary yelled, staring in shock and horror as her leader crumpled, “YOU LITTLE BITCH! I’LL TAKE YOUR HEAD!”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, the boss wanted the students alive–!” a mercenary in mage robes called out, but the knight wasn’t listening, instead charging for the princess as she took the hammer and shield from the fallen captain.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard took a breath as she recalled seeing her professor do so many times before, then angled the shield. When the knight charged, she moved, letting the armored knight’s spear skid off the shield, bringing her in close enough for Edelgard to swing the hammer straight into the mercenary’s head. She didn’t even notice her crest flaring up as she did.</p><p> </p><p>The enemy mercenaries did though, and more than a few jaws dropped as they saw a tiny waif of a girl smash the head off of a fully armored knight. The lieutenant’s helmeted head flew free in a spray of blood, before Edelgard stepped forward with an imperious glare.</p><p> </p><p>“H-Holy shit…h-how did…”</p><p> </p><p>“So that’s what a crest can do…”</p><p> </p><p>“G-Goddess, she’s a monster! F-Fuck this, I’m not dying for some damned cult, no matter the gold they’re giving me!”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard stiffened, before her eyes locked on the mercenary that spoke last, who froze before he could run. “...What did you just say?”</p><p> </p><p>“H-Hhiieeee!” the man squealed, before turning and running along with the rest of his mercenary band as a scowl came to Edelgard’s lips. </p><p> </p><p>“Pathetic cowards…" Scoffing, Edelgard turned to the nearest resident. "You, are there any buckets we can use to carry water over?" </p><p> </p><p>"Y-Yes, miss." </p><p> </p><p>"Then bring them over, we need to hurry before the fire gets any worse!" </p><p> </p><p>"O-Of course!" the man responded as he began to gather other residents to carry water over. Nodding as she sees them move, Edelgard went back to the dormitories to inform Leonie and Ashe what happened. </p><p> </p><p>Her heart stopped as she saw the bodies of mercenaries on the ground, arrows and spear wounds littering their bodies. Rushing forward, Edelgard found Ashe and Leonie on the ground, groaning in pain. </p><p> </p><p>"What happened!?" Edelgard asked, crouching down by the two, silently cursing herself for not having any bandages on hand for the two. </p><p> </p><p>"S-Some mercenaries came rushing towards us after you left," Leonie explained, holding her bruised arm. </p><p> </p><p>"Th-They took the professor," Ashe managed to gasp out as he tried to push himself up. </p><p> </p><p>"...what?" Feeling her blood run cold, Edelgard ran into the room, and found that the bed where her professor was, lay empty, while Sitri's body remained on hers. Gritting her teeth, Edelgard slammed her fist into the wall hard enough to crack it. </p><p> </p><p>Someone was going to pay dearly for this.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Shez had to admit, she would normally be really, really happy right now. She was on an adventure, searching for a mysterious artifact, and fighting a legion of ghostly warriors! It was the type of story she’d read about as a kid! Normally, this would be the best thing to ever happen to her!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s just, well, her sister wasn’t there. She didn’t need to have Byleth by her all the time, she wasn’t that clingy, but it did mess things up a little since Byleth was still injured and then there was that stuff with that weirdo Aelfric guy and Missus Sitri. It just made things feel weird, and while she wasn’t about to get distracted in the middle of a fight, it was still kind of a downer, like a cloud hanging over everything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You doing okay over there, Shez?” Claude called out, catching Shez’s attention as she cut through a ghost-knight’s neck, splitting its phantom head from its phantom neck before she hopped off its ghost horse. Which also vanished when the knight did, which was weird.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I’m fine! Any luck on the chalice hunt?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not much, though Dimitri and crew found a giant living statue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez’s eyes immediately lit up with obvious interest and excitement. “WHERE!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Over that way–And she’s gone already.” Claude huffed in some amusement, before raising his bow and loosing an arrow into another phantom cavalier, killing it and the horse at the same time. Somehow. “Hm…I wonder if the horses are part of the ghost, or it just leaves when the knight dies?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not hearing his query, Shez rushed towards where Claude gestured, finding Dimitri and Dedue up against a giant statue, who was currently trying to smash Dedue into the ground as Dimitri circled around it. And while she definitely wanted to help her friend, she couldn't help but grin at how freaky looking it looked, since its head had a knight helm, while its chest was a lion face. They also had two shields bearing the Crest of Seiros on its shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And as interesting as that was, Shez immediately rushed in to slash at the statue. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Begone from this place!" the statue shouted as it tried to retaliate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It can talk!?" Shez shouted in surprise while dodging its arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now is not the time to be in awe," Dedue reprimanded, smashing his axe into the statue while he had some slight reprieve. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But this is awesome!" Shez shouted back, only for her excitement to end as Dimitri’s spear pierced the statue, causing it to stutter, before falling limp. "Aw, damn it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sorry?" Dimitri apologized, not really sure what the problem was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Letting out a huff, Shez looked at the statue, before noticing something hanging from it. "Is that a key?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh… so it is…" Dimitri muttered. "Oh, I believe I heard Yuri mentioning something about stones that looked like they had keyholes in them?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In that case, guess it's up to me to save the day!" Shez shouted as she grabbed the key, before running off! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez, you're running away from the battle!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned around and began to run off again! In the right direction!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh? What are you doing back here?” Claude asked, prompting Shez to pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Uh…hm…” She frowned. “...I have no idea where I’m supposed to bring this key.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahh. Well, I can’t exactly help with that.” He glanced upwards. “Why not ask the mopey Lady Nuvelle up there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” Shez glanced up at the noble on her pegasus and a grin came to her face. “Good idea! Be right back!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she promptly vanished in a flash, which earned a slightly worried look from Claude. “Did she just…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, all the way up in the air, Constance von Nuvelle abruptly found herself feeling somewhat cramped as a random young woman appeared on her steed with her. “Ah, so this is how I die. How appropriately pathetic…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “Uh…jeez, you really don’t handle the sun well…why do you ride a pegasus if you’re not good with bright spaces?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I apologize for my incongruous abilities…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...For your what–No, never mind! Where’s the statue thingy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My apologies for not understanding what you mean…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"This thing! Where does this thing go!" Shez said, shoving the key in front of Constance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh… well, I may be mistaken, but there is a large source of magical energy over there," Constance said as she pointed at an area near the cliff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There is no need to thank-" And before she could finish putting herself down, Shez disappeared again. "...She truly was in a hurry to get away from me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, appeared by the cliff face and immediately noticed a stone podium that had a hole in it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There we go!" With a grin, she shoved the key in, before hearing a small rumble. Glancing around confused, Shez heard the sounds of battle die down as the statues went limp and the phantoms disappeared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? Is that it?" Balthus asked, looking around as if he wasn’t covered in scrapes and bruises. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't tell me you want to fight more," Hilda complained with a sigh as she sat down on a large rock. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I'm good," Hapi agreed from atop her horse, petting its mane as she wandered over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, the stone is glowing!" Petra suddenly exclaimed, pointing behind Shez, which got the mercenary to turn around and look at the cliff. On the stone, four crests began to glow, before the rock crumbled, revealing a hole in between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Walking over, Shez immediately reached into the hole. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Partner, please at least be cautious when it comes to mysterious holes," Arval muttered, only for Shez to cheer as she brought out a chalice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Woo! Guess you can add relic hunter to my list of achievements!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, sounds like you're having fun," Yuri commented with a smirk, "Though are we sure it's the right item?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh sure it's totally the… uh…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The Chalice of Beginnings, and at the very least it's a highly magical relic," Arval chimed in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, it's the chalice!" Shez said with a grin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I can't say for certain," Lindhart started, "But I think if we found a chalice hidden behind a barrier decorated with the Crests of the Four Apostles, guarded by golems that bore the Crest of Seiros, underneath the monastery…well I think it's safe to assume." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nice! In that case, let's go!" Shez declared, beginning the march back to Abyss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well someone is in a hurry," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The sooner we are returning, the sooner we can help the professor," Petra said as she moved to catch up with Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It’s a good point. And if nothing else, we should hurry back before it gets too dark," Dimitri added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, that'd probably be for the best. Come on, Coco," Hapi called to her friend as she urged her horse to walk back to the tunnel, before pausing as the statues began to make a whirring noise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh?" Blinking in confusion, Hilda looked up at the statues, before shrieking as they suddenly started going wild. "Wh-What the heck!? I thought we won already!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Guess we gotta fight some more!" Shez exclaimed, making an immediate about face with a bright grin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha! I was hoping to beat up some of these things!" Balthus yelled, until some nearby crashing of trees got everyone's attention as they saw a much larger statue emerging. "...Well shit." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha, what's the problem big guy? Are you starting to–" was all Shez could say before she got scooped up by Balthus while he and everyone else began to run back to the tunnels. "Hey!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As the Intelligent King of Grappling, I say we save the fighting for when we aren't facing a giant!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Balthie I think that's the smartest thing you've said in your life!" Hilda shouted, surprisingly keeping pace with the much taller guy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey I've said plenty of smart things! Like the time I outwitted a bounty hunter by–!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure you can tell us all that fascinating story when we aren't in mortal peril!" Yuri shouted over the crashing noises of the statues chasing them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We're almost to the tunnel, they won't be able to fit through the doorway!" Dimitri shouted when they almost reached their goal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You better not jinx us your highness!" Claude responded as he ducked into the tunnel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If need be you can leave me behind to distract them," Coco offered, which made Shez think it was a good thing the blonde was on a pegasus with better survival instincts than her. Thankfully, her personality went back to normal as the steed dived into the tunnel. "Ah, move quickly! The genius of the Nuvelle House cannot perish here!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh, why did I agree to this…" Lindhart muttered as he entered last, breathing heavily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Cause of this thing?" Holding up the Chalice, Shez grinned. "Now come on, we gotta-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A loud crash got their attention as the group looked back towards the entrance and saw one of the statues crash into it, cracks forming around the doorway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I told you not to jinx us," Claude said as the massive statue backed up to ram again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Every cute lady for herself!" Hilda shouted as she began to run again. Which was probably for the best as moments later the statue rammed in hard enough to break through the wall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooo, wow, these gold ones are strong,” Shez marveled. If she was being honest, a sight like that was even kind of intimidating. But it also made her really want to try taking it on… “Hey, Yuri!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is now really the best time to talk–” Yuri blinked as his hands moved on reflex to catch the chalice Shez just threw at him. “...What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold that for me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Partner, this is a terrible idea,” Arval warned as Shez turned to the golem with a grin, summoning her sword and pointing it at the big metal monstrosity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“HEY BIG GUY! YOU GOT A NAME?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, what are you doing?!” Dimitri exclaimed while Claude stared at his reckless friend in baffled exasperation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think a giant statue is going to have a–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agarthan weaponry detected. Response Selected: I bear the name Marcelle,” the golem answered, before twirling a golden spear in its twisty hand as it shone with a holy light,  “And your soul shall join all those who dared to profane these sacred grounds!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, big gal, not a big guy. Gotcha!” Shez replied, before shifting away from the blast of golden light and darting in close to score a cut across the big golden lady’s lion chest. Which was very hard to cut through with her standard sword, but surprisingly easier with her magic sword, which kinda made sense? Magic sword probably was made of better stuff than her regular steel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hm, now that she thought about it, what was her sword made out of? As she considered that question, Shez shifted around Marcelle to slash at the Lion Lady's back, then looked at everyone else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are you waiting for? I'll catch up later!" she shouted, still cutting at the giant golden golem all the while.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, I am not thinking the professor will be happy if we leave her," Petra noted, drawing her sword again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And I am not leaving her to fend for herself!"  Dimitri shouted as he brandished his spear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha! In that case!" Grinning, Balthus rushed forward, jumping up into the air and slamming his fist into the helm of Marcelle. "Bet you I can take this thing out first!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're on!" Shez shouted back with her own grin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They can't be serious…" Lindhart muttered in exasperation as Dedue rushed forward without a word to aid Dimitri. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ohohoho! Do not think I shall let this chance to show off the ingenuity of House Nuvelle slip by!" Grabbing onto the reigns of her pegasus, Constance flew towards the battle, readying her own spell as she did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Great, they're all idiots…" Holding back a sigh, Hapi watched as the students fought Marcelle, the mages among them hitting the golden golem with blasts of magic while the melee fighters either went for direct strikes or moved to the statue’s blindspots. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Guess she fits right in with us," Yuri noted, watching Shez fight alongside his classmates with some weary amusement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, there they are!" Blinking, Yuri turned around and found a group of mercenaries standing nearby. "There it is! The boss was right, that purple-haired girl has the treasure thing!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Yuri began to silently curse Aelfric for making things more difficult for him. That, and his hair was lavender, not just ‘purple’.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How the hell did they find out about the Chalice?" Claude asked as he drew an arrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't think that matters right now," Hilda grumbled, letting out a sigh as she brandished her axe, “I should have argued harder to stay behind…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t agree more,” Linhardt muttered, stepping next to Hapi…or more accurately putting his fellow mage and her horse in between him and the mercenaries.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well at least I found some kindred spirits,” the redhead muttered before another battle began in the underground, this time between the backline and the bandits flanking them. Which was slightly easier than dealing with the golden golem, though the bandit brawlers still put up a decent fight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahahaha! Foolish statue, you are no match for the mystical might of–Eep!” Constance squeaked as her pegasus reared back to avoid catching a spear of light in the side, “H-How rude! You could at least let me finish!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Interlopers shall not be tolerated,” Marcelle rumbled, her chest cracked and the metal that made up her body visibly denting and tarnishing under the student’s onslaught, “Thieves. Descrators. Allies of the Great Enemy. You shall all perish.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“‘Great Enemy’?” Dimitri muttered, a frown coming to his face, before grimacing as Dedue stepped in front of him to catch a spear strike on his shield, “Ah, thank you, Dedue!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine, your highness! Just keep behind me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great work, Dedue! Just keep Marcelle focused on you!” Shez shouted, before shifting into her awakened form and hopping up the golem’s spiky body to stab her magic sword straight into the Lion Lady’s throat, piercing into metal instead of flesh. It still made the giant stiffen and twitch like someone who had been stabbed in the neck, so Shez was pretty sure she dealt a solid blow there. “Heh, sorry about that, Lion Lady, but I’m pretty sure we need this chalice more than you do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The golem twitched again before it seemed to focus on Shez. “A-A-A-Al-lert. En-nemy Iden-Iden-Identified. Agarthan S-S-S-Sorcerer, Pri-Pri-Priority One. Zanado shall be avenged–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked as the whole thing seemed to lock up, steam spilling from between its joints. “Eh? What was–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Partner, move!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval didn’t normally shout, so Shez was already off the shoulder the instant their words registered. Which was a good thing, given a massive beam of light neatly seared through where she was just standing, taking a good chunk of Marcelle’s shoulder with it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, hey! What was–Oh shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even Shez could feel her bravado fade when she saw the other golden golem from outside making its way into the catacombs, alongside what seemed to be a squadron of lesser stone golems, all of whom seemed to be focused on her. “Ah…Right! We’re running now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes, we are,” Dimitri agreed, slowly backing up before he noticed Marcelle turn her head in his direction, still apparently active and ready to fight, “...Shez, what in the world did you say to them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhhh…not sure.” She paused, then raised a hand in greeting towards the other Lion Lady. “Hey, do you have a name too?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?? I’m curious! She seems important!” And the only response Shez got in response was another massive beam of light from the new Lion Lady, who barely missed thanks to being damaged. "Right, running!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not waiting another moment, Shez began to run, leading the group that were fighting against Marcelle to where everyone else was fighting bandits. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, Boss, we're getting out of here!" Balthus shouted, as he rushed past Yuri, shoulder checking the bandit Yuri was fighting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Finally," Yuri huffed, before he began to run. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Tallyforth comrades!" Constance shouted, sending a small barrage of spells at the bandits to get them to back off enough for everyone to start running. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, get back here!" one of the bandits shouted, not noticing the golems approaching them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Th-Th-Thieves, all-allies of the d-desecrators!" Marcelle declared as they descended on the bandits. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Guess it was a good thing those bandits showed up," Yuri noted as screams of pain and several bloody breaking noises were heard from the tunnel behind them.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Indeed. Those beings are not hitting two birds with one arrow," Petra agreed, getting Yuri to let out an amused huff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah but those things are going to still try to chase us down later, right?" Hapi asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, idea!" Grinning, Shez turned around, and brought her hand up as she got a spell ready. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, Shez, what are you doing?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Something smart!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Something really stupid," Arval muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ignoring her partner's words, Shez began to form several Dark Spikes that shot out, stabbing into the walls and ceiling behind them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, is that safe-" Before Hilda could finish her question, the spikes exploded. Almost immediately a plume of dust flew towards the group, making them cough heavily before Lindhart was able to clear the air with a spell. What was once an open tunnel was now collapsed, nary an opening in the rubble. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There we go!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Thank you, Shez, but perhaps you could warn us next time?" Dimitri asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I’m pretty sure we’d all appreciate a heads up before you cause a cave in,” Claude commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, it's fine, I made sure not to shoot near us," Shez responded, "Now come on, we gotta go! Yuri, you still got the chalice, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you think I would have lost it after all that?" he asked, somewhat amused as he held up the Chalice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Never hurts to make sure!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Quite right, and with the Chalice surely I am a step closer to restoring my house!” Constance added, “Why I'm sure Edelgard is practically waiting for me to return with it!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez gave her a side-eye. "I’m pretty sure she's probably busy making sure By is okay, actually." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh there is no need for that, your sister is still asleep." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? I mean, it's been a few hours so I'm sure she's awake." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If I did not cast a sleep spell on her, she likely would be." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Surely you understand! That poor girl looked absolutely exhausted! Trust me, that spell will ensure she has some proper rest and will wake up completely refreshed!" Constance boasted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh. Well, if you say so," Shez muttered. She could admit that By looked like she needed her rest, though it still sounded inconvenient. Well, hopefully Byleth was awake by the time she got back. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY TOOK BYLETH!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard met Shez’s enraged gaze with a composed stare. She showed no hint of pain despite Shez’s shout being loud enough that she was confident everyone in Abyss had heard it. A part of her idly noted this was the first time she had seen the possible Agarthan’s “awakened form” this close to her, and that it was a decent sign that her emotions were genuine. “I mean what I said. While you were gone, bandits attacked Abyss. I went out to deal with them, but apparently more attacked Leonie and Ashe while I was gone and escaped with the professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"HOW ARE YOU BEING SO CALM!?" Shez shouted again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I've had nearly an hour to collect my thoughts," Edelgard responded, her hands clenched behind her back, "Including what seems to be their demands." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Saying this, Edelgard held out a parchment, which Shez immediately snatched away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Quickly, Shez began to scan the paper to see what they wanted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘We have abducted Cardinal Aelfric and the girl. We can guarantee their safety, for now. If you want to help them, meet us tomorrow evening in the ruins of the old chapel. Bring the chalice. Know that if you alert the knights, their lives will be forfeit.’</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...They want the chalice in exchange for Aelfric and Byleth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? They have Aelfric too?" Balthus asked in surprise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taking in a small breath, Shez let go of the paper before walking over to Yuri. "Hand it over." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hand the Chalice over. Now." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, not that I'm disagreeing with you Shez, but we do have to have a plan," Claude spoke up, before stiffening slightly as Shez glared at him for a moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The plan is to hand the chalice over and save my sister." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And we need to wait till tomorrow to do so. We don't know where the bandits are hiding," Edelgard pointed, keeping steady as Shez glared at her. "It also said not to inform the knights but…I doubt we can keep the disappearance of a Cardinal and the professor a secret." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"At the very least we must inform Lady Rhea," Dimitri stated, "Even if the Knights don't get involved, surely she can provide some help." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Letting out a frustrated noise, Shez tried to calm herself down. "...how are Ashe and Leonie?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Recovering, apparently the bandits had orders to not kill any of the students. Which begs the question of how they knew there were students down here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? Didn't we fight some mercenaries before? Of course they'd know we're down here," Hilda said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We didn't leave any of those mercenaries alive. There was no way for word to spread." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They also apparently knew Aelfric is a Cardinal," Lindhart said, reading the fallen paper. "That's supposed to be a well kept secret in the church. So whoever these people are working for is well connected." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Grumbling to herself as the students began to plan, Shez walked off. Despite the fight she had just been in, she was feeling restless again, and wanted to hit something again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez?" Turning around, Shez found Edelgard following her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What do you want?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I understand any apologies I have may ring hollow, but even so, you trusted me to keep the professor safe, and I failed you. However, I swear to you that I will make sure we save her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez sighed, trying not to snap at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I also might…have an idea of who took the professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh?! You do?!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes. The mercenaries mentioned a cult, and there were a group of dark mages working with them. While I cannot be certain, I've had to deal with a cult like that in the past. No matter what, I will not let those people harm her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez scratched the back of her head. "Look, no offense, but it’s kinda hard to take you on your word with what happened." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I understand that. I would honestly be surprised if you did. Were I in your situation, I likely would have gone charging off on my own." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm. That’s weird. I dunno why, but something about you reminds me of By," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I do?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, both of you are pretty clumsy with your emotions," Shez teased, with a small grin to show she was joking, "And you both get attached to people easily." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez, this better not be another attempt to mock me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's not. I'm just saying, you're hiding it well, but you're pretty angry right now aren't you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't know what you mean," Edelgard responded, before Shez pointed down at her hands. Glancing down, Edelgard noticed that the palms of her gloves were stained with blood thanks to how hard she was clenching her fists. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Must have not noticed, huh?" Shez asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...That I did not," Edelgard responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You should make sure to get someone to check that," Shez advised, "For now though… I'm going to try and get some sleep." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, that sounds for the best," Edelgard agreed with a nod, "I'll make sure to tell you what we're going to do." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks, Edelgard." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Watching her walk off, Edelgard took in a quick breath. She needed to send a message soon, before anything could happen. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Slowly drifting awake, Byleth became aware of two things immediately. The first being she was sitting up against a wall rather than a bed. The second being that she was currently tied up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snapping fully awake as the second of those facts set in, Byleth tried to break free of the rope. Though that was easier said than done given that she was missing her weapons and also had a Silence spell cast on her so her magic couldn't work. Looking around, she realized she was something that looked like a former storage room, some broken shelves nearby being the only thing in there with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"-ould you bring the wrong girl!" Blinking as she heard Aelfric's voice, Byleth stopped moving as she tried to listen in to what was happening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, my men listened to your orders! You told us to bring the sleeping girl, and we did!" Someone shouted back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And I specified a green-haired woman!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Teal is a type of green!" At that, Aelfric let out an aggravated sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No matter, we can get Sitri later. As long as we get the Chalice then the plan can continue." At the mention of her mom's name, Byleth began to struggle again as she let out a muffled shout. "..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Moments later, the door to the room opened, and Aelfric stood at the doorway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Mng!" Byleth tried to shout at him as she struggled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You have to understand, I didn't mean for things to go like this. You just need to play along for a bit. Once I have the chalice, then I can bring Sitri back." The cardinal smiled as best he could. It looked more like a strained rictus. “You’ll have your mother back. I know she’ll be happy to see you. I just need a little more time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stared at him. It was strange. Aelfric should look completely insane, spouting lines like that, but he looked and sounded the same as he had when he talked to her beside her mother’s grave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Somehow…that was scarier.</span>

  <p>As night descended upon Garreg Mach, so did the Flame Emperor as she waited at the outskirts of the monastery. It was dangerous, what she was doing. Being the one to initiate contact with Those Who Slither could be taken as a sign she was willing to work with them more than she already had. If she wasn't careful, they might try pushing for more…</p><p> </p><p>"I must say, I didn't expect to come out here because you asked me to," Bias said after she appeared in a flash of magic, a mocking tone to her voice. </p><p> </p><p>"...I have the information you wished to know. I felt it only appropriate to inform you of it," the Flame Emperor responded, getting Bias to stiffen before leaning forward with an impatient eagerness.</p><p> </p><p>"Well? Out with it, tell me!" </p><p> </p><p>"Jeralt’s Mercenaries were not in the Oghma Mountains five years ago. By that time, they had already entered Faerghus territory," she lied, keeping her tone even, aided by the distortion her mask provided. </p><p> </p><p>"What!? That's impossible, she had to have been there!" Bias shouted, which really wasn’t conducive to keeping their meeting secret, "How do you know she didn't lie to you!?"</p><p> </p><p>"I asked her sister. Professor Byleth would have no reason to keep where she was a secret. As it stands, there is little chance they are the ones you are seeking." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Letting out a frustrated growl, Bias vented her frustrations by shoving her hand against a nearby rock jutting out of the ground. It seemed she remembered she shouldn’t draw attention, though the fact that the rock began to melt where her hand touched gave Edelgard a good indication of just how enraged the sage was. That, and the level of power she appeared to have.</p><p> </p><p>"...There is something else I require from you,” she said, catching the sage’s attention again, “Are you involved with the plot happening in Abyss?" </p><p> </p><p>"What?" Bias asked after she calmed down, "That dingy town? What would I want to do with that?" </p><p> </p><p>"So you are aware of the town then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, as though I wouldn’t be. It’s too close to the monastery to be a decent source of testing materials though, so Solon wrote it off.”</p><p> </p><p>“I see. And you’re not involved with what is happening down there?”</p><p> </p><p>"I would need to know what is actually happening to be involved," Bias said with a scoff. </p><p> </p><p>"...Very well, I shall take you on your word." </p><p> </p><p>“You do that…So that’s it? She can’t have been there?” She stared at Edelgard, her agitation obvious even with her face concealed. “And you’re sure of that?”</p><p> </p><p>“I am completely sure,” the Flame Emperor replied.</p><p> </p><p>“...Bah. Fine. I’ll find my own answers.”</p><p> </p><p>The Flame Emperor watched Bias stomp away, agitation obvious in every step. She considered the possible benefits she may have just lost out on, what she could have gained by simply giving the sage the answer she wanted, but…</p><p> </p><p>She shook the thought off. She made her choice already; there was no taking it back and it would be a waste of time to dwell on it.</p><p> </p><p>Once she arrived back at an appropriate location, Edelgard began to remove her armor. While she did, she began to think about what Bias had said to her. </p><p> </p><p>If the bandit attacks and Byleth’s abduction weren’t a plot by the Slitherers then who was behind it all? The existence of the cardinals was something only the upper echelons of the Central Church should know, so was there a schism within the church that led to Aelfric’s abduction? For that matter, why would they also take the professor as well? It would be one thing to take the relic weapon, but to kidnap Byleth too… </p><p> </p><p>Unless…that wasn't the initial plan. If the perpetrators had knowledge of the Cardinal, then surely they would know who the professor was. In that case, why wasn't her name specified on the paper?</p><p> </p><p>Blinking, Edelgard came to a sudden realization. </p><p> </p><p>The mercenaries had already known about her, Ashe, and Leonie being present in Abyss, and the fire was an attempt to distract them. However, there was no need for the mercenaries to distract the students if they already had the cardinal in their grasp. Even more so since they had nothing to gain from kidnapping Byleth…unless she wasn't their actual target. </p><p> </p><p>If the perpetrator had just demanded the Chalice, it would greatly narrow down who could have told the mercenaries of Aelfric’s status. Yet, if they were after <em> Sitri </em>, rather than Byleth, then their knowledge of her existence further narrowed the possibilities down. And if that supposition was accurate, then it was remarkably obvious who the perpetrator had to be.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard scowled. If the Cardinal thought he could play them like fools, then she would play along, for now. But he was mistaken if he thought he could get away with this.</p><hr /><p>Rhea had lived a very long time. She’d seen things the majority of humanity would regard as impossible, and done things that would shake the foundation of the entire continent, were they to become known. </p><p> </p><p>Even then though, she found herself almost constantly stymied and baffled by humankind and the absolute nonsense they would get up to.</p><p> </p><p>“...” She looked at Alois, who was standing at attention. Then she looked at the students gathered in front of her, of which there were a shockingly large number crowding her audience chamber. She did not look at Seteth, because she had honestly hoped he wouldn’t be present for this kind of conversation for a number of reasons, and she idly sent a small prayer to her mother than Jeralt wouldn’t find out about his youngest daughter’s “adventure” before she managed to settle things. “...To be clear, Miss Eisner, your sister, Professor Byleth, was abducted by mercenaries hired by an unknown cult in order to claim a mysterious, ancient relic known as the Chalice of Beginnings.”</p><p> </p><p>“YES! Do I need to repeat everything for you?! You have working ears, right?!” the young woman complained, which Rhea decided to allow because she was obviously distressed.</p><p> </p><p>“Miss Eisner! Mind your words in the archbishop’s presence!” Seteth, however, had no such sympathy.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, my mistake, I actually meant to say <em> shove it up your– </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri put a hand on Shez’s shoulder at the same time Claude put a hand over her mouth. “Please, pardon Shez’s words, Lady Rhea. She’s very distressed by her sister’s disappearance.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, she’s not taking it great,” Claude added, then moved his hand before Shez could bite it.</p><p> </p><p>"You really should be careful partner, less they decide to hold you in a cell for attacking someone of importance," Arval advised, unheard by anyone besides Shez, who settled back, still irritated but trying her best to stay calm.</p><p> </p><p>“Not to worry, children, I take no offense. It is entirely understandable that young Shez would be worried for her sister,” Rhea replied with appropriate magnanimity as she tried not to show any hint of her own internal turmoil. Along with attempting to ignore the pink wyvern in the room…Or, well, green wyvern, as the case may be.</p><p> </p><p>To think they would find Sitri down there…She really should have gotten a coffin for her, at the very least, but the fire happened and Jeralt vanished and she never got around to it…A part of her idly wondered if she could fully put the blame on Aelfric so that Jeralt wouldn't murder her. </p><p> </p><p>Goddess, her thoughts were morbid these days…</p><p> </p><p>Now, certainly, from the outside, it looked as though Aelfric had been abducted along with Byleth but she didn’t believe that for a second. To think, she made Aelfric a cardinal and yet he never bothered to come to the meetings even once. How was she supposed to induct someone into her inner circle if they didn’t bother to show up??</p><p> </p><p>"For now, I think it would be best to leave this to the knights." </p><p> </p><p>"Pardon me, Lady Rhea," Constance said, speaking up, "But for the sake of those taken, I believe it would be best to not have the knights involved given their letter explicitly said to not involve them." </p><p> </p><p>"It would be for the best to at least make it seem we're playing along," Yuri noted. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, and besides, Shezster is strong, so she'll probably be more helpful than any knight," Hapi commented, which did earn a frown from Seteth and a slight pout from Alois. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, she might not be as strong as me, but she definitely has the speed to make up for it." Balthus added in. </p><p> </p><p>"...Very well, I understand where you're coming from,” Rhea decided, “I shall allow you to act, and use the Chalice as you should require." </p><p> </p><p>And that, as expected, earned Seteth’s ire. "Lady Rhea, you can't be serious!" </p><p> </p><p>"I am. Seteth, you must understand how poorly things will go if we do not listen to their demand of leaving the knights out of this. Not only do we risk the lives of Professor Byleth and Cardinal Aelfric, but we may also lose the Sword of the Creator." </p><p> </p><p>“But you’re talking about sending students to deal with people willing to abduct a cardinal! Who knows what they could be capable of!?”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea did her best to avoid pointing out the majority of her cardinals just worked menial jobs around the monastery outside of their gatherings. It wouldn’t do to let slip to the students that the head cook was actually important to the politics of the church…</p><p> </p><p>Shez, thankfully, directed attention away from that potential gaffe by scoffing. “Oh come on, I fought a giant lion lady yesterday, I can handle a bunch of sister-stealing bandits.”</p><p> </p><p>Seteth blinked. His internal conflict was visible as he tried to decide if he should ask or let that be, before deciding on asking, which was good for Rhea because she was both curious and concerned. “‘Giant lion lady’?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you know, the big statue people. Their leaders are gold and have lions on their chests. Oh, and the one I fought is named Marcelle, she told me that.”</p><p> </p><p><em> …why in the world would Marcelle give a student its name? </em>Rhea wondered, before discarding that thought as, hopefully, irrelevant. She briefly considered going down and talking to the golems, but dismissed that thought too as not being worth the effort. It would take the good part of a day and she really had too many things on her plate already to investigate something that was bound to be pointless anyway. “I am afraid I know little of what you speak of, child. The monastery is ancient and its mysteries are vast. Some tales speak of ancient guardians, though I think it holds little relevance to our current crisis.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, right, Byleth is more important! So can we get to saving her already!?”</p><p> </p><p>"Before that, we must make sure we're fully prepared," Yuri said, "We don't know what exactly these men are planning, so having a plan of attack would help make sure neither of them are hurt." </p><p> </p><p>"...Geh, fine. But the moment the plan is ready, we're going!" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course. Though, if I may, I would like to speak to Yuri alone," Rhea requested, looking at the leader of the Wolves, "So if you would all leave, I would appreciate it. That includes you, Seteth." </p><p> </p><p>Despite her kind tone of voice, it was clear Rhea wasn't going to argue this. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh? Why only Yuri–” But of course someone had to push it.</p><p> </p><p>“That wasn’t an invitation to ask questions, Claude.”</p><p> </p><p>"...very well. Do try to be quick about it," Seteth said to Yuri, before bowing to her and escorting the students and Alois out. He had to actively steer Claude out, which was a mildly amusing sight. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, it seems we're in quite the sticky situation." Yuri said once they were alone. </p><p> </p><p>"That we are…to think Aelfric was after the Chalice of Beginnings…" </p><p> </p><p>"And it's easy to guess what he's planning. I don't suppose you'll mind telling me why exactly our mercenary friend’s mother was in the Abyss like that?" </p><p> </p><p>"...” Rhea sighed, cursing her own past indolence. There were a great many things she should have handled, but never did. “I had Sitri entombed down in the Abyss after her passing. I know Aelfric was close to her, but I did not know he would actually try to revive her." </p><p> </p><p>"And sacrifice the Wolves in the process." </p><p> </p><p>"...I shall have my knights act quickly, while you handle Aelfric." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, thank you, Lady Rhea. Though I can't help but wonder what our dear Aelfric is planning. We still have Sitri's body so clearly he must know he can't revive her that easily." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, it shouldn’t be possible for him to do anything…” Still, memories of her own past failure rose up, unbidden, in her mind anyway. She frowned, thinking back to a screech of a monstrosity that should not have been. “Hopefully, we can end this before anyone gets hurt."</p><hr /><p>Silently sawing away at the rope binding her arms with a broken piece of a shelf, Byleth felt a small twinge of annoyance at how thick the rope was. It also didn't help that Aelfric kept coming in to cast a Silence on her to make sure she couldn't use her magic. </p><p> </p><p>"One would think he would at least treat you more kindly," Sothis muttered as she appeared next to her. "He's doing this all for your mother, yet he hardly seems to be paying attention to you." </p><p> </p><p>Huffing into her gag, Byleth could feel the rope start to give way, just a bit longer…Pausing, she looked up to see the door open, Aelfric walking inside holding a tray of food. </p><p> </p><p>"Here you go, it's not much, but you should still make sure to eat," Aelfric said, setting the tray down by her and removing her gag. "I'm sorry for all-" </p><p> </p><p>"Why are you doing this?" Byleth asked, glaring at him. </p><p> </p><p>"I…did you not hear me before? So that Sitri can return to us." </p><p> </p><p>"You didn't even know I was here until recently. You were just doing this for yourself." </p><p> </p><p>"I-!" Aelfric cut himself off before his anger could rise too far. "...it's fine if you don't understand. Things will be better when she is back. I'll have the chalice and the blood of the four apostles, so all shall be well." </p><p> </p><p>"...The Apostles?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, that's right, you didn't hear about that. The Chalice is supposed to be used in a ritual using the blood of the apostles to bring someone back to life. They tried this before in the past, long ago. It's my belief that they simply did not use enough blood." </p><p> </p><p>"What?" Byleth looked at him in confusion before something clicked in her mind. "...The Ashen Wolves." </p><p> </p><p>"...yes, it will be a tragedy, but one that cannot be avoided." </p><p> </p><p>"That…you're going to kill them? To try and revive my mom?"</p><p> </p><p>"Of course. I would do anything for your mother. Surely you and Captain Jeralt must agree with me." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth felt a sense of dread build up in her as she stared at the man who claimed to be a friend of her mother and father. "...You're insane." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Aelfric let out a sigh. "It's okay that you don't understand. You never met her, so you don't have a desire to bring her back. It's almost sad when you think about it. That I care more about Sitri than her own daughter." </p><p> </p><p>Despite herself, Byleth couldn't help but try to move away from him. </p><p> </p><p>She steadied herself though, trying to keep calm. "...I might not know her, but even I can tell she would never forgive you if you did this." </p><p> </p><p>"It doesn't matter if she forgives me or not." Aelfric said, even as he frowned. </p><p> </p><p>"But you're still going to put that guilt on her!” she yelled, a sudden anger rising up, “Everyone who gets hurt or dies because of your plan would be something she'd have to live with!" </p><p> </p><p>"Why don't you understand! Things will be better with her here–gah!" In one quick motion, Byleth brought her legs up to kick Aelfric straight in the chest when he tried to approach her. Crashing to the floor, the cardinal gasped for breath before pushing himself up with a pained wheeze. </p><p> </p><p>"You-..." Cutting himself off again, Aelfric took in a deep breath. "...You'll be freed once everything is over. Until then, you'll remain here." </p><p> </p><p>Getting up, Aelfric cast another Silence on her again, before walking out. </p><p> </p><p>Taking a moment once she was alone, Byleth tried to settle her nerves. She wasn't sure how Aelfric could have ended up like this, but she wasn't going to let him succeed in his plans. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, he certainly made a mistake," Sothis commented with a smirk, before pointing over at the tray of food Aelfric had left behind. More specifically, at the knife that was on the tray. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm. That's useful." Shifting her position, Byleth began to crawl over as best as she could, aiming to grab the knife. </p><p> </p><p>"But honestly, what could that man be thinking? Those who have already passed away should remain as such. Trying to bring someone back will just cause undue sorrow to the one that can't accept their passing," Sothis muttered as Byleth began to cut the ropes. </p><p> </p><p>"Let's just make sure he doesn't cause the death of anyone else," Byleth responded. Even if a small part of her did want to meet her mother, to get to know the woman who brought her into this world, there was no way she’d let anyone be hurt for it to happen.</p><hr /><p>Fidgeting slightly as they made their way to the abandoned chapels, Shez kept a hand resting on her sword. She wanted to rush on ahead, but she also knew that could put Byleth in danger. </p><p> </p><p>"A word of warning," Edelgard said, walking alongside Shez. "Keep an eye on Aelfric." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh? What are you talking about?" </p><p> </p><p>"Call it intuition, but just keep an eye on him," Edelgard continued, before moving away from her, leaving Shez a bit confused. </p><p> </p><p>"She is right, there is something suspicious about him," Arval added, "He was definitely hiding something when we interacted with him back in the Abyss." </p><p> </p><p>"That's obvious…" Shez muttered, before pausing as Constance approached her, her eyes downcast. </p><p> </p><p>"Before we arrive, I once again offer my words of sincere apologies, even if they are worth nothing." </p><p> </p><p>"...Constance, you really don't need to apologize so often. You didn't know what was going to happen." </p><p> </p><p>"Even so, if need be, I will throw away my meager life so your sister and Aelfric return alive." </p><p> </p><p>"Hey now, no throwing away your life, Shady Lady," Yuri interjected. "We're all making it out of here alive, okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, the booze at the party after this is gonna taste bad if any of us die!" </p><p> </p><p>"There's gonna be a party?" Hapi asked as she glanced at Balthus. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course! I mean hey, we found a relic and are going to save two people, so we might as well celebrate!" </p><p> </p><p>"Fair enough." </p><p> </p><p>Letting out an amused huff, Shez found her nerves calming down a bit as they arrived at the meeting place to find a group of mercenaries staring them down. The leader of whom, a skinny, brown-haired guy, was not only holding Aelfric, but had the Sword of the Creator at his waist. </p><p> </p><p>"HaHaHa! You certainly took-" </p><p> </p><p>"Hey you son of a bitch, where's my sister!?" Shez cut him off as she glared at the bandit boss. </p><p> </p><p>"Huh? Who the hell are you?" the leader questioned, scowling at her. </p><p> </p><p>"Shez Eisner, the sister of the person you kidnapped, and the merc who's gonna murder you if you don't bring her out here!" </p><p> </p><p>"The message said you would exchange both the cardinal and the professor in exchange for the chalice, but as far as we see you are reneging on the deal," Dimitri stated. </p><p> </p><p>"What? You can't hand the chalice over to them, it's irreplaceable!" Aelfric shouted. </p><p> </p><p>Shez scowled. "So is Byleth, and so the deal isn't happening until you bring her out!" </p><p> </p><p>"And what's to stop us from just killing all of you if you don't hand it over?" the leader asked with a smirk. "I don't know if you can tell, but I have a bonafide relic weapon here!" </p><p> </p><p>"One that doesn't have a crest stone in it, which means it's practically useless outside of Teach's hands." Calling his bluff, Claude smirked in return, which made the lead merc bristle. </p><p> </p><p>"Regardless of how strong you think you are, you can't seriously imagine being able to outrun the knights forever if you kill several students and a cardinal," Edelgard taunted. </p><p> </p><p>"Ha! As if the Great Metodey is afraid of the knights!" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, good thing we have our own plan," Yuri said. Though before he could give the signal, a sharp whistling sound could be heard. At the sound, Shez immediately smirked.</p><p> </p><p>"Huh? Who the fuck is making that noise?" Metodey asked with a scowl. Though before he could find the source, he let out a scream of pain as a knife was thrown into his arm. Letting go of Aelfric as he screamed, Shez appeared in front of Metodey, shoved the cardinal back, and slashed him across the chest. “GAH! K-Kill them! KILL ALL OF THEM!”</p><p> </p><p>Shez would have kept going to cut the boss’s head off, but she was too busy dodging back as the other bandits charged in with axes and a number of them all around the valley started popping up. “Jeez, where do these guys find each other?! We’ve killed so many of your men and you’ve got like a hundred more!”</p><p> </p><p>“I-It’s called having backing, you stupid bitch!” Metodey yelled back, clutching at the cut across his chest as he let a pair of better armored mercs step in front of him. Some of his earlier confidence returned as the rest of the Academy brats suddenly had to deal with his reinforcements and he sneered at the violet-haired student. “And now, thanks to you, the cardinal dies–!”</p><p> </p><p>Then he heard, of all things, a sigh. Which wouldn’t really be enough to catch his attention, were it not for the sudden *fwump* noise he heard behind him and the shadow that seemed to block out the sun. Then he turned around and saw the giant bird regarding him with a hungry eye. “...well that’s just not fair at all.”</p><p> </p><p>The bird did not care, and it was only a well-timed leap backward, along with a shove to his subordinate’s back, that got Metodey out of the way as the bird’s beak snapped down, lifting the screaming merc up as it tried to crack through the steel armor. Fortunately for the mercenary, his armor was strong enough to keep him alive.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately for the mercenary, the annoyed bird had a solution to the oddly tough and screaming nut it was trying to eat, and promptly started smashing it against a nearby rock.</p><p> </p><p>Even Metodey couldn’t help but wince at the crunch, though when he turned away, he found that everything else he could see was worse, because apparently the band of students he’d been accosting weren’t a bunch of limp fops that would be easy to push around, but genuine monsters who were absolutely demolishing his goons.</p><p> </p><p>“Wha…What are you idiots doing?! It’s just a bunch of noble brats!” he shouted, raising his sword, “Just get in and kill–GAH!”</p><p> </p><p>And then he was screaming again because an arrow went through his hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Not all of us are nobles!” shouted some orange-haired girl with a bow, which was about as baffling of a statement as Metodey could expect in this situation.</p><p> </p><p>“Is now really the time to assert your commonality?” Constance asked, frowning at Leonie.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not the right word,” Yuri commented, prompting a scowl from the pegasus rider before a cloud moved and she bowed her head in apology.</p><p> </p><p>“My sincere apologies for my–”</p><p> </p><p>“FUCK! MY HAND! I NEED THAT, YOU BRATS!” Metodey snapped, before trying to calm down–Which was extremely difficult when a giant bird just landed nearby, prompting him to beat a hasty retreat from that. “Hm-hm-hm, right, not dealing with that–”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you up to take me on then?” Shez asked, smirking as the bandit boss flinched back.</p><p> </p><p>“Gh–You again! Fhh…fine! I didn’t want to use this with how much I could get from selling it, but I’m not dying to some brat playing knight!” he snapped, before grabbing the relic sword at his waist and drawing it. Metodey sneered again, his confidence returning yet again as he leveled the strange sword at the stupid girl–And then he felt a wrenching sensation as the sword suddenly felt far too heavy and fully dislocated his shoulder with a sickening sound. “...aaaAAAAAAAGH–!”</p><p> </p><p>“Eugh. That looks nasty,” Shez muttered as the guy kept screaming.</p><p> </p><p>Metodey, meanwhile, was having the worst day. Fortunately for him though, the pain did cut out as a tray smashed into the side of his head hard enough to knock him out.</p><p> </p><p>Shez beamed as her sister pulled her sword from the unconscious bandit boss’s mangled hand. “Heh, hey By!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hi Shez. Thanks for rescuing me.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez beamed, bright and happy to the point that Byleth was pretty sure if she had a tail, she’d be wagging it. “Heh, you’re welcome! Though I’m pretty sure you got loose on your own there.”</p><p> </p><p>“Still. Thank you.” She turned, looking out at the chaotic battle unfolding and feeling a faint smile come to her face as she saw all the students working together to cover one another and take down the mix of mercenaries and monsters. “Let’s clean things up here.”</p><p> </p><p>“You got it! The Violet Demon and the Ashen Dragon, back on the battlefield together!” Shez declared, sounding downright giddy, “Let’s do it!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, shouldn't leave this all up to them,” Byleth agreed, her faint smile fading into her usual stoic appearance, before the two rushed forward. Immediately going into her awakened form, Shez barrelled straight through a group of armored soldiers, sending them flying, before a certain whip-like sword snaked through the gaps in their armor to slice them as they fell. </p><p> </p><p>As the screams of those knights were quickly cut off, the sisters continued their fight, easily moving in sync as they fought together. Despite being the younger sibling, Shez definitely looked the most dangerous with her twin blades and obvious excitement, leading the mercenaries to target Byleth. Which turned out to be a bad idea, as despite being less visibly threatening, she was skilled enough to knock people off their guard with a punch to the face, or a parry of their weapon. Which meant Shez could run in and cut them down, taking every opportunity given by her sister to score another kill.</p><p> </p><p>And that was before the Silence wore off and Byleth could bring her magic to bear. Not only did her sword weave and stab, cutting and piercing through whatever foes she had to face, but fire and thunder rained on anyone unlucky enough to be trying to fight her students as she called out orders, coordinating attacks while Shez acted as her primary fighter, darting in to support whoever needed it and absolutely destroying whatever mercenary or bandit tried to get in her way. </p><p> </p><p>The demonic beasts were a little trickier to deal with, but definitely not impossible for the Eisner sisters. Oh, and everyone else, of course. It wasn't long for the battle to come to an end, and for a swell of pride to grow in Byleth as she saw her students unharmed. </p><p> </p><p>Though that quickly faded as she threw her regained dagger, the blade burying itself into the wall next to Aelfric before the cardinal could even speak. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey! What was that for!?" Balthus shouted. </p><p> </p><p>"It seems our professor is well aware of what this man is up to," Edelgard said, raising her axe at Aelfric as she did. A small part of her was, admittedly, somewhat miffed that she couldn’t be the one to reveal the plot she’d figured out, but that was a silly part that she clamped down on with practiced ease. She most definitely did not pout. </p><p> </p><p>"Wh-What are you talking about?" Aelfric asked, as he looked at Byleth, his eyes pleading for her to-</p><p> </p><p>"You were going to sacrifice the Ashen Wolves to bring back my mom." Uncaring of his pleading, Byleth began to approach the corrupt cardinal. </p><p> </p><p>"...What?" Hapi asked, staring in confusion. </p><p> </p><p>"Aelfric, my horrid ears must be deceiving me, for what I heard cannot be the truth, right?" Constance asked, some concern cutting through her morose malaise.</p><p> </p><p>"O-Of course it isn't! There is no way I would harm my flock!" Aelfric denied.</p><p> </p><p>"Really? So it doesn't matter that Lady Rhea has Sitri's body and has buried her already?" Yuri asked. </p><p> </p><p>"What!?" Aelfic felt a flash of anger hit him before he tried to calm himself. </p><p> </p><p>"My mom died when I was born. You need to accept that, Aelfric," Byleth said, leveling her sword at him. </p><p> </p><p>"...Of course you wouldn't want her back. She died giving birth to you, the child who makes no sound," Aelfric muttered as he began to glare at Byleth. "It wasn't just Rhea who killed her, it was you as well, wasn't it!?" </p><p> </p><p>"What the hell is wrong with you!?" Shez shouted, stepping in front of Byleth to glare at Aelfric, “You asshole! You’re the one who stole her body and sent those bandits after your people! They were setting fires down there!”</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t matter! Everything will be fine once Sitri comes back! But you…” He scowled, glaring at Shez and Byleth before turning his gaze towards Yuri. “You should think very carefully about what you’re doing here.”</p><p> </p><p>“I did, ‘boss’. And I decided since Lady Rhea already knows everything and knew you were up to no good from the start, I might as well turn on you now instead of letting your plans continue.” Yuri gave him a mocking grin. "I really should thank you for bringing all your soldiers along, it made saving my people pretty easy." </p><p> </p><p>“You–How dare you…”</p><p> </p><p>“‘Saving your people’?” Balthus questioned, glancing at Yuri with a frown, “Hang on Yuri, what’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s supposed to mean our good cardinal here abducted my mother and held my former gang hostage to make sure I would play along with his plan,” Yuri readily explained, “Which included gathering all of you up so you could be sacrificed. Ah, sorry about that, by the way. I was looking for a way out of it, but I was prepared to go as far as I needed if I couldn’t save them ahead of schedule.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…wow, that’s heavy. Not sure if I should be pissed at you or not.”</p><p> </p><p>“It would be a fate befitting a wretch like me,” Constance mumbled while Hapi looked from her friends to Aelfric, a building feeling of betrayal showing through her usual attempts at controlling her emotions.</p><p> </p><p>“Elfie…did you seriously…does that mean you were the one that put me down in Abyss…?”</p><p> </p><p>“SHUT UP!” Aelfric demanded, glaring back at the Wolves, “Don’t–Don’t look at me like that! I was the one who helped you to begin with! Isn’t it only right that you help me in return!?”</p><p> </p><p>“You…You’re talking about murdering them!” Dimitri exclaimed, and Aelfric’s eyes widened as he noticed just how many of the students had gathered, “You cannot call that repayment!”</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, this is pretty underhanded even by my standards," Claude muttered as he kept a hand on an arrow, ready to aim if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>"Aelfric, please, just stop. My mother wouldn't want this," Byleth pleaded as she stepped closer.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you even know…" Gritting his teeth, he raised his hand, a sigil already forming. "WHAT DO YOU EVEN KNOW-" </p><p> </p><p>Coughing up blood, Aelfric looked down to see the Sword of the Creator piercing his chest. His arm falling to his side, Aelfric soon fell to his knees. </p><p> </p><p>"..." Pulling her blade free, Byleth stared down at the Cardinal, who looked up at her in return. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…Sitri…? You… returned to me…" Seeing a small smile on his face, Byleth watched as the light left Aelfric’s eyes as he slumped over. </p><p> </p><p>Unable to look away, Byleth felt… something uncomfortable as she started down at the man, wondering just how someone could look at peace after dying. Feeling a hand on her shoulder, she looked over to see Shez standing behind her. </p><p> </p><p>"Let's go back, By." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Nodding in response, Byleth turned away, drawing an end to this story.</p>

  <p>Byleth didn't say anything on the trip back to the monastery. Everything that happened still felt…uncomfortable to her. She didn't know why, she had only met Aelfric recently. If anything, she should be checking on the Ashen Wolves. </p><p> </p><p>At that thought, she stopped in her tracks before turning to the Wolves. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"There's no need to worry about me, my friend," Yuri replied with his usual smile. No hesitation to his words, no hint of trouble, he didn’t seem like he needed to think about his answer at all. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I mean…the booze is gonna taste bad for a while, but nothing I can't get past," Balthus replied with slightly more hesitation. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm already used to stuff like this, so I'm used to it," Hapi said, and Byleth decided not to comment on how she repeated herself. </p><p> </p><p>"..." Constance looked down at the ground. "The pain of betrayal is something a wretched being deserves." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…" </p><p> </p><p>"No need to worry there, friend,” Yuri reassured, “Shady Lady here just isn't good with the sun, so don't take what she says seriously." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, By, she acted pretty differently when she was underground, remember?" Shez reminded.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh…" Byleth seemed to think for a few moments, before pulling her coat off herself and throwing it over Constance. </p><p> </p><p>“Gah–W-What? What in the–...Oh. Oh, I see! What a brilliant decision, professor!” Constance praised, “To think, the solution to my other self could be found so readily!”</p><p> </p><p>“...Coco, you just have a coat covering your head,” Hapi pointed out, “Can you even see like that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sight is entirely unnecessary in a situation such as this! Because…well…” She sighed. “I…I did not expect things to happen like this. I had hoped…but perhaps this is for the best.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, no, Constance is still being mopey Constance!” Balthus exclaimed, “The coat’s not working!”</p><p> </p><p>“It is working perfectly fine, you oaf! I can be upset without being my other self!"</p><p> </p><p>"...Why don't you four go back to the abyss for now? I'll talk to Rhea and inform her of what happened." </p><p> </p><p>"You sure, my friend?” Yuri asked, “It does seem like a very important discussion to be had with her." </p><p> </p><p>"I dunno, I wouldn't mind going somewhere deep into Abyss and letting out a big sigh," Hapi commented, which earned a grin from Balthus.</p><p> </p><p>"In that case, I'm definitely up to bash some monster heads!" </p><p> </p><p>"Honestly, I would agree to go with you, but who knows how seriously these scoundrels will take it," said the former noblewoman still under a coat. </p><p> </p><p>"I insist. You all need the rest," Byleth affirmed.</p><p> </p><p>"Well alright then," Yuri agreed with a shrug, before glancing at Shez. "Make sure to take care." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Sure thing," Shez responded as the Ashen Wolves began to walk off, Hapi biting back a sigh as she grabbed Constance's hand to make sure she didn't get lost. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, in that case, why don't we let the professor handle things from here?" Ashe suggested. </p><p> </p><p>"As the house leaders, we really should go along with the professor-" </p><p> </p><p>"Nah, they got it handled. Come on Mister Prince, I wanna see your spear techniques on the training grounds." Cutting him off, Leonie wrapped an arm around Dimitri’s neck and began to pull him along, much to the prince’s surprise. </p><p> </p><p>"I ask that you not pull his highness like that," Dedue insisted as he followed the pair. </p><p> </p><p>"Please don't tell me now Dimitri might poach a classmate…" Claude groaned, prompting a giggle from Hilda.</p><p> </p><p>"Pft, well, good luck with that Claude. I don't know about you, but this girl needs to hit the sauna." </p><p> </p><p>"I am not understanding, to poach is to hunt without permission, yes?” Petra inquired, “What hunting is Dimitri doing?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ask me again after I had a nap," Linhardt answered. Well, he didn’t really answer anything, but still. </p><p> </p><p>Letting out a small sigh at her classmates’ antics, Edelgard gave the sisters a nod, before following behind her fellow students. </p><p> </p><p>"..." Scratching the back of his head, Ashe glanced at Byleth. "...Is it okay if I bring flowers for Missus Eisner later?" </p><p> </p><p>“...Sure. I think she would appreciate that,” Byleth replied with a small smile.</p><p> </p><p>Ashe smiled back before heading off, leaving the sisters alone. Shez let out a sigh once he was gone, then gave Byleth a pat on the back. “You doing okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Not especially. Everything feels…off.”</p><p> </p><p>“You did have to kill your mom’s old friend. That’ll throw anybody off.” Shez frowned. “Come to think of it…hey, By, next time there’s any kind of person you don’t feel great about killing, why don’t you let me do it instead?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked. “...I would hope that there’s never a person I feel great about killing.”</p><p> </p><p>“You know what I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I don’t. That sentence was ridiculous.”</p><p> </p><p>“Gasp! Rude! See if I’ll ever offer to kill someone for you again!” Shez glowered at her sister, before breaking into a giggle that made Byleth smile. “Seriously though, name anybody, I’d do it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure you would,” Byleth replied, giving her sister a pat on the head and making her pout.</p><p> </p><p>“You know I have to lean down when you do this, right? Because you’re so short?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not that short.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nah, you’re totally a shortie.”</p><p> </p><p>“What does that make Lysithea then?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a question I can’t answer without future pain, so I’m not gonna. Besides, she’s fifteen, right? She could still wind up taller than you. Some people get late growth spurts.”</p><p> </p><p>“Defending your lady’s honor from your dastardly sister. How cute.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can think of a lot of words to describe you, By, and dastardly is not one of them. Short definitely is though.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth huffed, though she did have a small smile on her face as she continued to banter with her sister on the way up to Rhea’s office. It did fade once they got there though.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey Professor Seteth,” Shez greeted, raising a hand to the chamberlain, who sighed.</p><p> </p><p>“Miss Eisner, I am not a professor. In the context of the Academy, I would technically be the Headmaster, but I am primarily Lady Rhea’s chamberlain.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, gotcha, Sir Seteth.”</p><p> </p><p>Seteth pinched the bridge of his nose, before looking at Byleth. “Hello Professor. I presume everything has been resolved then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Can I talk to Rhea?”</p><p> </p><p>He frowned and Byleth prepared herself for some kind of denial or annoyed remark– “Are you alright, professor? You seemed distressed.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Ah, uh…I’m not doing that well, no. I want to talk to Rhea about it.” She felt herself tense as the thought occurred that she would have to tell her father that she killed his friend. “Can I? Please.”</p><p> </p><p>“You may,” he allowed, “She’s already expecting you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You want me to hang back?” Shez asked, giving her sister a glance.</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah. I think we–me and her, we should talk about this…about everything.”</p><p> </p><p>“No problem! I can just chat with Seteth.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth tried to ignore how the chamberlain’s face fell as she entered the archbishop’s office and found Rhea waiting for her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello child. I must admit, I am surprised to only see you here.”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought the students should get some rest. And…that we should talk. Privately.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea smiled. “I had been hoping we could for some time, though I suppose these circumstances are not quite what I was hoping for…Would you like to tell me what happened?”</p><p> </p><p>"...Aelfric refused to stand down, so I had to kill him. All of the students, including the Ashen Wolves, returned unharmed." </p><p> </p><p>"...I see. That is… painful to hear. Though I know he nearly committed a grave sin, he was still someone I cared deeply for. I saw him like a child of mine, much like how I saw your mother." </p><p> </p><p>"...How long have you known?" </p><p> </p><p>"Since you arrived. Though I know Jeralt might have had his reason for keeping your existence a secret from me, it was obvious the moment I saw you that you were Sitri's child." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth felt her body tense up. Try as she might, she couldn't get Aelfric’s words out of her head. </p><p> </p><p>"...Is there something you wish to say, child?" </p><p> </p><p>Staring up at her, Byleth found herself unable to stop the words from coming out of her mouth. "Did you kill my mother?" </p><p> </p><p>Rhea couldn’t have looked more shocked if Byleth had outright punched her. Confusion, horror, offense, and even anger warred across her face before she managed to regain some semblance of composure, but even that was wavering in the face of such a question. “What…? I–Child, how could you think that?"</p><p> </p><p>"Jeralt told me what happened. About how you never let him see Sitri's body, and how you acted around me. Aelfric…before I killed him, he told me that that you–that we killed her. What happened to my mother?" Byleth demanded to know, as she tried not to look away from Rhea. </p><p> </p><p>"...Oh, child." Taking a step forward, Rhea flinched back as Byleth reflexively drew her dagger and stepped backwards. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t–D-Don’t try…” She swallowed, trying to keep some composure as she realized the archbishop wasn’t trying to hurt her. That the movement towards her wasn’t hostile, that she looked hurt, not angry. “...s-sorry. Sorry, I…N-No, no, you need to tell me. Please, I…I need to know. I need to know what happened!”</p><p> </p><p>“...Child, I would never hurt Sitri. I loved her. She was my daughter in every way that mattered.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then what happened?!” Byleth snapped, a mixture of anger and grief for someone she’d never met welling up in her chest. </p><p> </p><p>Rhea seemed to wilt under Byleth’s accusatory gaze. “I…failed her. I failed her like I have failed many before her, though in this case…” She took a breath, and then met Byleth’s gaze steadily. “I was the midwife for your birth. I helped as best I could, but your mother had always been sickly, ever since she was young. The strain of birth was difficult for her, and she likely would have passed away even if…”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth blinked tears from her eyes, her breathing not quite ragged, but getting there. “E… E-Even if?”</p><p> </p><p>“You would not have survived either,” Rhea explained as she relived the events of that day, “You were born cold and without breath. Without intervention, you would have been dead, but your mother did not accept that. And so…I did something that I…were I in that circumstance again, I would have made the same choice. </p><p> </p><p>“Sitri asked me to exchange her life for yours. In essence, I gave you her heart. With the last of her fading life, I ensured you would survive, and she passed in peace because of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Her heart?" Byleth clutched her chest,  thinking of how her heart didn't beat. But…it was her mother’s heart? “She…died for me?”</p><p> </p><p>“She gave her life for yours. And I know it is a trade she would have willingly made again were it ever required of her.” Rhea gave a small, sad smile. “She loved you, child. You were hers, and she loved you so very dearly.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth swallowed, her throat tight again. Her heart didn’t beat, but she could feel it ache. “...”</p><p> </p><p>“I see this question must have been hanging over your head for as long as you have known me.” The archbishop let out a sad little laugh. “Your discomfort in my presence makes a great deal of sense now.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah. Yeah.” Byleth let out a slow breath, one hand still resting on her chest. “Thank you for telling me.”</p><p> </p><p>The tension hadn’t left her body. She still felt strange in Rhea’s presence. But knowing the truth…it did change things.</p><p> </p><p>Her grip on her dagger loosened and she sheathed it again before it could fall from her fingers. “Sorry. I…I’m sorry. I didn’t…”</p><p> </p><p>“It is fine, child. Believe me, I have done worse in the throes of grief,” Rhea replied, smiling sadly. She hadn’t expected to see so much of herself in the young woman.</p><p> </p><p>"...Did you already bury my mom?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, not yet. I…In the past, I didn't have the strength to bury her, and even now I don't. I think it would be for the best if Jeralt decided what to do, if that is alright." </p><p> </p><p>"...yeah. Yeah that sounds good." </p><p> </p><p>"If I had known that keeping the truth of what happened was the reason Jeralt had left all those years ago…" Rhea let out a sad sigh. "I know it may be far too late to ask this, but I pray that you give me another chance." </p><p> </p><p>"I'll… think about it." Byleth responded, getting Rhea to smile. "What will happen to the Ashen Wolves?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I shall need to find someone to keep watch over Abyss but…given that Aelfric was the one to establish it, then the Ashen Wolves will likely be disbanded." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…Will they be okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"That is up to them. They aren't shackled to Abyss anymore, so they can do as they wish. Regardless of what they choose, I hope that you can guide them." </p><p> </p><p>"I'll do my best." Byleth glanced up at Rhea. "...Thank you, for telling me the truth." </p><p> </p><p>"...Of course, child. And once again, I'm sorry," Rhea apologized, inclining her head as Byleth left. </p><p> </p><p>"The 'truth' huh?" Sothis mused. "I can't help but wonder if she even knows how to tell the whole truth…" Staying silent, Byleth wondered as well as she walked out towards where Seteth and Shez were. </p><p> </p><p>"So hey, are you and Rhea related?" Was the first thing Byleth heard as she walked out. </p><p> </p><p>"What?" </p><p> </p><p>"Just wondering, I mean, you both got the green hair, albeit different colors, both of you are pretty important to the church, and you both have birthdays on Saint days, like how Flayn does too!" </p><p> </p><p>Seteth sighed. “Miss Eisner, hair color does not denote relation. Do you think I am also related to young Linhardt?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Are you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. Let me put it a different way, are you related to Lorenz or Bernadetta?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Am I?? Ordelia is really close to Gloucester…”</p><p> </p><p>Seteth did his best not to groan as Byleth walked over and patted her sister on the head. “Oh, hey By. You finish talking to Rhea?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m done. Now…I guess we should go talk to dad. Or at least…figure out what we’re going to say when he comes back.”</p><p> </p><p>"Ah… yeah." Nodding to her, Shez glanced at Seteth. "Thanks for keeping me company, see ya Seteth." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth noted how grateful he seemed now that Shez was leaving. </p><p> </p><p>"So…what exactly happened?" </p><p> </p><p>"Mom… apparently gave me her heart when I was born. It was the only way to save me." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Shez grabbed onto Byleth. "...Missus Sitri sounds like a really nice person." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah…It might be wrong to say, but I can't help but wonder…If Aelfric did succeed…would she be around? I…I really want to know her, to tell her about you, and everything we've been through and everyone we met." </p><p> </p><p>"...Yeah, that sounds like it would have been nice," Shez said, as she did her best to grin. "So we gotta make sure to tell her plenty when we visit her grave." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm… that sounds nice." </p><p> </p><p>"Exactly! Who knows, maybe the afterlife is in need of mercs too, so when we go there, she can put in a good word for us!" </p><p> </p><p>"...I feel like I would want to retire by that point." </p><p> </p><p>"...Yeah, fair enough. So, did anything else happen?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah… apparently Rhea saw my mom as her daughter." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh…wait, does that make her our grandma?" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth began to think. "...Does it?" </p><p> </p><p>"I see no reason why it should," Sothis chimed in. "Family is chosen, even if they are of blood. She has no valid claim in being family lest you wish for it." </p><p> </p><p>"Sothis says only if we want to have her be our grandma… and I'm not sure if I want to," Byleth said, frowning. "I feel like she's still hiding something important. So I don't know if I can trust her." </p><p> </p><p>"Right, in that case, she's not family," Shez agreed with a smile. "We already have each other and dad. We don’t need to add anybody that we don’t want!" </p><p> </p><p>Back in her office, Rhea felt inexplicably sad for some reason, but disregarded the sensation because that happened a lot anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyways, what do you want to do now?” Shez asked, “We’ve still got a lot of the day to go and I’m sure nobody will mind if we just hang out.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I am pretty hungry, actually,” Byleth admitted, “Food first? Then we can try to figure out how to explain all of this to Jeralt.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I’m sure telling him about all this won’t be too bad. Dad’s pretty understanding.”</p><hr /><p>Jeralt didn’t understand anything. In fact, he was pretty sure he’d lost his ability to understand languages completely because everything his daughters had told him was completely insane.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I wasn’t even gone for a week. How the hell…? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"..." He let out a heavy sigh as he leaned back in his chair. He thought for a moment, trying to latch onto something. "...You two are okay, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I think so," Byleth responded, giving a close proximity to a smile. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, you don't have to worry about me,” Shez added, “By was the one who dealt with the big stuff." </p><p> </p><p>"Right…and everything Rhea said?" he asked.</p><p> </p><p>"...I think she's still hiding something, but I think she told the truth there," Byleth replied, “Ah, about mom giving her life for mine, I mean. I’m…not completely sure if the heart part is literal, since it doesn’t sound physically possible, but maybe it’s a magic thing?”</p><p> </p><p>"...sure." Jeralt let out a tired sigh. "So that's why she never told me anything…heh, you think you know someone, and they keep so many secrets from you." <em> Or kidnap your daughter and try to resurrect your wife from the dead. What the hell, Aelfric? </em></p><p> </p><p>“How long have you known Rhea anyways, dad?” Shez asked, curious, and Jeralt considered how honest he should be. The hypocrisy wasn’t lost on him.</p><p> </p><p>"I was…a bit older than you are now I think. I was just barely starting out when I first met her." </p><p> </p><p>"Wow, sounds like someone got a lucky break. I mean, meeting someone that important when you're young means you'll have connections, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well… it was thanks to her that I met Sitri at least," Jeralt muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"...Papa, do you think stopping Aelfric was a mistake?" Byleth spoke up.</p><p> </p><p>"..." Reaching over, Jeralt gave his kid a pat on the head. "No, it wasn't. Sitri… She was the kindest person I ever knew. I don't think she could have lived with the knowledge that four people had to die for her." <em> And Aelfric really must’ve lost it if he thought otherwise. </em></p><p> </p><p>"You know, Missus Sitri sounds alot like By. If she was around we'd have two worrywarts fussing over everyone." </p><p> </p><p>"...I don't fuss." </p><p> </p><p>"By, Dorothea told me you're using your own money to help pay for things for the class." </p><p> </p><p>"We keep getting sent on dangerous missions, I want to make sure they're well equipped," Byleth said, with a slight pout, "Besides, I don't fuss over the mercenaries." </p><p> </p><p>"That's cause you're not in charge of them yet. Heck, I bet you'd probably give anyone a raise if they said they needed it." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth glanced at Jeralt. "Are any of them in need of money?"</p><p> </p><p>"See what I mean!" Shez said with a laugh as she poked at Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"Hmph." Byleth continued to pout while she looked away from Shez. </p><p> </p><p>Jeralt smiled at his daughters’ antics, though it faded as his mind turned to more serious topics. "So…that just leaves what to do with Sitri's body…" </p><p> </p><p>"...I think we should bury her. I might not like the church, but this is where mom grew up, right?” Byleth said, “So she'd probably want to be buried here." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea," Jeralt agreed with a smile. "I'll make sure to talk to Rhea about that." </p><p> </p><p>“You know, it’s weird that she just left Missus Sitri down there in Abyss,” Shez pointed out, “Should we ask her why? Because that is super weird. Like she wouldn’t just forget, would she?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think she’s that stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>Elsewhere, Rhea sneezed.</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt, meanwhile, thought back on what he knew of the archbishop. “...Let’s leave that for later.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Should we ask why she still…looks like that?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah." Jeralt thought for a moment. He wouldn't be surprised if Rhea had tried to give her some of her blood in hopes that would help her get through the birth. It was the only explanation he could think of. "...It's probably some kinda spell she put on her." </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hm… hey, Byleth, should we go get some flowers?” Shez asked, “I mean, I know we're not burying Missus Sitri right now, but still." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, we should. Mom would love that." </p><p> </p><p>"That she would. And I have to say, I'm glad you two aren't fighting anymore," Jeralt said with a small smile. "I'm sure Sitri is happy too…though, that reminds me." </p><p> </p><p>Fishing around in one of his pockets, Jeralt brought out a small pouch. Pulling it open, he brought out an intricate ring. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, is that…mom's?" Byleth asked, staring right at it.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, it's the only keepsake I have of her…heh, probably should have gotten one for myself if I knew I was going to have two kids." </p><p> </p><p>"Shouldn't that be something By gets, not me?" Shez asked. </p><p> </p><p>"You're as much a family to mom as I am," Byleth responded as she nudged Shez, "Though I'm surprised you're not trying to make it a competition." </p><p> </p><p>"...pft, what, the first one to get married wins? Kinda a weird competition don't you think?" </p><p> </p><p>“You seem to have a few suitors already.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No I–Wait, who’s this even about this time?”</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt raised an eyebrow. “...So you have ‘suitors’, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“No! By’s just being dumb, again,” Shez insisted, “Besides, she’s the one with the crush!”</p><p> </p><p>"I don't."</p><p> </p><p>"She does?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes she does! Dorothea told me you gave her a flower!" </p><p> </p><p>"You did now, huh?" Jeralt asked, suddenly very interested. "You know there's nothing wrong with admitting you have feelings for someone, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"I know that, but I also don't have a crush on her." </p><p> </p><p>"Come on By, you gotta at least be interested in someone." </p><p> </p><p>"Just because I find someone pretty doesn't mean I want to date them," Byleth protested, "Besides, even if I was, that doesn't mean they want to date me." </p><p> </p><p>"Well I think Edelgard does want to date you." </p><p> </p><p>"Now you're just messing with me." </p><p> </p><p>"What's so hard to believe about someone wanting to date you?" </p><p> </p><p>“I just don’t see why they would want to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Byleth, you’re objectively hot and you like wearing shorts, stop being dumb.”</p><p> </p><p>“...what does my sense of fashion have to do with this?”</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt felt like he shouldn’t be here for this conversation, so he just stood up and left while Shez let out an exasperated groan.</p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth glanced down at her outfit. "I like it at least."</p>

  <p>Byleth let out a slow sigh as she walked around the monastery. She couldn’t help but focus on Shez’s comment about her fashion. Well, she could focus on something else, but she really didn’t want to think about Aelfric and how tense that entire situation made her feel. So much like all the thoughts of her students dying, she shelved those elsewhere. </p><p> </p><p>“Should I buy something new…?”</p><p> </p><p>“Greetings Professor, nothing to report today!” Blinking, she looked over to see the gatekeeper standing nearby. “Is there something on your mind?”</p><p> </p><p>“...A few things. Hey, quick question, you see a lot of people thanks to your job, right?” </p><p> </p><p>“That I do! Were you looking for someone in particular?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I just wanted to ask if you noticed any fashion trends around now?” </p><p> </p><p>“Uh…my apologies professor, I don’t really take notice of such things,” the gatekeeper said, frowning apologetically, “May I ask why you want to know?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just thinking of trying something new.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hm…students tend to change into the summer uniform around this time of year, so maybe something like that? Though I guess it’s not that hot this year…”</p><p> </p><p>“Summer uniforms…got it, thanks Gatekeeper,” Byleth said, nodding in response.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, Professor.” Waving her goodbye with a smile, unaware of what he set in motion.</p><hr /><p>"What are you wearing?" Sothis asked as she looked down at Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"Apparently it's a 'summer uniform' that the students have in case it gets warmer around here," Byleth responded as she looked at herself in a mirror, admiring the white blouse and tan skirt that conformed to her body, "Decided to try something different since apparently my sense of fashion isn't great."</p><p> </p><p>"And why are you wearing that?" </p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged in response. "It was the best option." </p><p> </p><p>"What?" </p><p> </p><p>Byleth didn't answer, and instead began to stretch a bit as she tried to see how well she could move in the outfit. "Hm…a bit more restrictive than my usual outfit. Probably shouldn't wear it in battle." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Sothis let out an annoyed sigh. "Fine, I might as well see what happens." </p><p> </p><p>A bit confused about her response, Byleth put on her pink headband to finish the outfit. Hm…should she get Dorothea a gift as thanks? She'd been wearing it practically everyday, so it seemed only fair… </p><p> </p><p>Something to consider later. Once she was ready, Byleth left her room, though she made sure to feed her pet crayfish before she did. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, it's a shame Shez is already on her mission today, would have been nice to hear what she thinks about my outfit," Byleth muttered to herself, and partially to Sothis as she walked. Though as she did, she couldn't help but notice the stares that were on her as she walked. Doing her best to ignore them, she made her way to her class. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, ByBy, any reason for the new outfit?" </p><p> </p><p>Blinking, Byleth glanced over to see Hapi standing nearby with Constance, the latter of whom was staring at the ground. </p><p> </p><p>"Felt like it. Also hello there you two, did you need something?" </p><p> </p><p>"There is nothing I could ask for that would be worth wasting your time." </p><p> </p><p>"Coco wanted to join your class, and I figured I might as well come along,” Hapi interpreted, “Course then she started getting like this after we got out in the sun, and stopped walking." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, well, sorry, I don't have my coat right now," Byleth apologized, though Constance just sighed. </p><p> </p><p>"There is no need to apologize for one such as me." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm. Well, if you two want to join, I'd be glad to have you be part of the Black Eagles. Good timing too, since this is my first proper day back as the professor," Byleth said, nodding to the pair, “What about Balthus and Yuri?”</p><p> </p><p>"Yuri-bird is sticking to Abyss for now, and B is joining the Golden Deer cause of some job or something,” Hapi explained, “Sounds like we’re lucky to have you back in charge of the class.”</p><p> </p><p>"I am unworthy of such a blessing." </p><p> </p><p>"Right, we should get you into the class," Byleth decided, before grabbing the former noble to pull her towards the class, where most of her students already were. "Morning everyone, we have some new people joining us." </p><p> </p><p>"Why yes! I, Constance von Nuvelle, shall be joining your class!" Constance declared, immediately bouncing back to her usual haughtiness once she was out of the sun.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey there," Hapi greeted with a wave. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, professor it's-" Ferdinand started to greet, before he suddenly faltered as he saw Byleth’s new attire. "H-Huh?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Um, professor, may I ask why you're wearing a summer uniform?" Dorothea asked, staring slightly confused, but also with some interest as her eyes moved up and down. </p><p> </p><p>“I felt like wearing something new," Byleth explained. </p><p> </p><p>"...and how did that translate to wearing a uniform?" Edelgard asked, looking away with a slight blush on her face. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I asked the gatekeeper for help. He didn't really know anything about fashion, but he mentioned that 'students tend to change into the summer uniform around this time of year, so maybe something like that?'." </p><p> </p><p>"...Thank you, Gatekeeper." Dorothea muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“Dorothea!”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Come on, Ferdie, a girl can like what she likes!” </p><p> </p><p>“How rude! Hapi and I grace you all with our presence, and you ignore us!” Constance complained.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hey there! Sorry, guess we’re just excited to see the professor back,” Caspar apologized with a grin. “Nice to meet you!” </p><p> </p><p>“Y-Yeah! It’s n-nice having you back, P-Professor!” Bernadetta greeted as enthusiastically as she could while hiding behind Hubert, all while keeping a cautious eye on the new students. </p><p> </p><p>“I suppose between you and Jeritza, you are the better choice,” Hubert admitted. </p><p> </p><p>“Wow, ByBy, you sure are popular. It’s kinda amazing” </p><p> </p><p>“The Professor is full of amazement,” Petra agreed.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph, about time you got back,” Emily muttered as she entered the room, “Good, I’m tired of hearing everyone complain about you being gone.” </p><p> </p><p>“...I’m glad you’re being more honest, Emily,” Byleth praised. </p><p> </p><p>"..." Letting out an annoyed huff, Emily went to sit down, ignoring everyone else. </p><p> </p><p>"Now then, I guess Lindhart will probably show up soon, so for now, we should get ready to start our lesson." Byleth said, nodding before she paused as someone else entered the room. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, Professor Byleth, I was unaware you were already returning to teach," Jeritza said as he stood by the doorway. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, did I forget to mention it? Yeah I've been given the all clear. Thanks for covering for me."</p><p> </p><p>"If you wish to thank me, we can spar later," Jeritza responded before noting her outfit. "...What are you wearing?"</p><p> </p><p>"A summer uniform." </p><p> </p><p>"...I see. It is inappropriate," Jeritza noted as he left, finding such an outfit completely unfit for combat. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." Byleth meanwhile frowned. She actually liked the uniform… Was her own sense of fashion that bad? </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, wait, it nearly slipped my mind in the commotion,” Ferdinand spoke up, pulling his eyes away from the professor, “But did you say your name was Constance Von Nuvelle?" </p><p> </p><p>"Why yes, I did, and am I correct in assuming you are Ferdinand Von Aegir?" </p><p> </p><p>"That I am! I can't believe it's actually you Constance, I haven't seen you in years!" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, do you know one another?" Dorothea asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course! Though I haven't seen her in years." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, actually, I guess we should make sure to properly meet our new classmates," Byleth said with a nod, before she glanced around and spotted Marianne. Standing a bit away from the class, the reserved girl seemed to be a bit overwhelmed, so Byleth decided to try and not draw attention towards her. She just gave the girl a reassuring smile, which she returned shyly.</p><p> </p><p>"Haaahn…” Linhardt yawned as he entered, before noticing the two new classmates, “Oh, hello. I didn’t know you were joining us. Would you care to tell me about your crests now?”</p><p> </p><p>Hapi raised an eyebrow. "Is that all you care about?" </p><p> </p><p>"What else is there to care about?" </p><p> </p><p>"Come now, Linhardt,” Ferdinand reprimanded, “Clearly we should at least prepare some tea for our new classmates first before entering such discussions."</p><p> </p><p>"My my Ferdinand, skipping class to have tea? I didn't know you had it in you." </p><p> </p><p>"I did not suggest such a thing!" </p><p> </p><p>"I dunno, today sounds like a good day to not do school work!" Caspar declared, full of his usual enthusiasm.</p><p> </p><p>"Only for a bit, we'll still be working later," Byleth stated as she walked to the chalkboard, frowning as she realized the lesson she had ended off with last month was still written on there. What had Jeritza been teaching them…</p><p> </p><p>Unbeknownst to her as she began to clean the board, Dorothea kept her eyes forward and low, taking note of how her skirt hugged the professor’s hips, before she quietly muttered to Edelgard. </p><p> </p><p>"You know, I'm not that religious, but I think we should thank the goddess for this lovely view."</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard stiffened, her face reddening, and cleared her throat. “Th-That isn’t an appropriate comment, Dorothea.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, but you agree, right~? Hm, I suppose it has been hot lately, maybe I should fish out my summer uniform too? And I bet you would look cute in yours!”</p><p> </p><p>"I have no interest in wearing that uniform," Edelgard responded, "As the house leader, I must show my pride in our house with my current one." </p><p> </p><p>"Fine, fine, always so serious~" Grinning, Dorothea glanced back at Byleth. "Though you really should make sure to hurry up Edie, or else someone might snatch her away first." </p><p> </p><p>"I already said it's not like that," Edelgard muttered, huffing as she looked up at Byleth…It really was odd that, despite how revealing her usual outfit appeared, the coat really did hide a surprising amount of her figure. </p><p> </p><p>"Did Jeritza really only have you guys spar while he was in charge?" Byleth asked, a rare bit of annoyance in her voice while she went over her planner that had been left of her desk. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, he said he was only an instructor of combat, so that is all he did," Petra answered. </p><p> </p><p>"I told him what some of my lessons I had planned were and he didn't even listen…great now we're a month behind." She was openly frowning now, looking about as irritated as the class had ever seen her be. They had seen her completely furious before, but seeing her annoyed was certainly different. “Hm…I suppose this does give the new students a chance to catch up while we review…The fact that he spent so much time with combat training probably means it’s okay to ignore that for now as well.”</p><p> </p><p>She seemed to think for a moment as she went over her notes. </p><p> </p><p>“Might be a good idea to have a group review…” Byleth muttered, before glancing back up at everyone. “Right, hope you’re all ready, cause I’m going to make up for lost time.” </p><p> </p><p>Letting a smile grace her features, Edelgard prepared herself for the lesson. It was good to have her professor back.</p><hr /><p>“Alright, I’m glad to see all of you have kept up your own studies as well,” Byleth complimented at the end of class, giving them all a thumbs up. </p><p> </p><p>At the back of the class, Marianne couldn't help but shrink away as Caspar let out a loud cheer at the praise. It was definitely going to take some getting used to with this new class, especially with how different Byleth was compared to Manuela. She always knew the mercenary was nice, far nicer than she should be to someone like her, yet she didn’t expect to feel so welcomed in the first class with her. Especially as Byleth approached her after class.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Marianne. I hope you were able to follow everything well.” </p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh, yes, there’s no need to worry about me.” </p><p> </p><p>“That’s good. Still, if you need help on anything, feel free to ask. I’m not exactly sure what Manuela's lessons have been like, but I hope I can match her.” Byleth paused for a moment. “Might be a good idea to ask her for help on Faith lessons…” </p><p> </p><p>“W-Well, I would hate to compare you two,” Marianne muttered, which was true for her at least. Even if she didn’t spend as much time with students after class, Manuela was a very passionate teacher. Albeit a bit too passionate at times… And the occasional hangovers she had weren’t great… </p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Oh, though I did want to ask, I’ll be having the students do some mounted training soon, if you could help me with that. The horses in the stables seem to really like you, so having someone help keep them calm would be appreciated.” </p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh… w-well, since you asked, okay.” </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Byleth said with a slight smile. “Oh, one other thing, do you think I poached you?”</p><p> </p><p>“...E-Excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just something Claude said. He claimed that his classmates were being ‘poached’, so I wanted to see if you thought that.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I-I don’t belong to C-Claude,” Marianne muttered, a bit confused by what the professor was saying. Strangely, she felt…a little annoyed too. “D-Did he say I did?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Not really. I think he means it in a classmate sense, since he’s the house leader.”</p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh…th-that does make more sense…” She frowned at herself for jumping to some stupid conclusion like that just because he had been prying–because he was trying to help. Just, trying to help. She was the one causing problems, as always…</p><p> </p><p>“Marianne? Are you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Marianne stiffened, startled out of her self-recrimination. “A-Ah, s-s-sorry, p-professor. I-I was, um…I-I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay. I’m glad to have you be a part of my class.” The professor smiled and Marianne felt her face warm up. “I hope I can help you be the best you can be.”</p><p> </p><p>“...a-ah…th-th-thank you, p-professor,” Marianne mumbled, ducking her head in the face of the professor’s overwhelming sincerity.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you want to have some tea later?" </p><p> </p><p>"O-Oh, sorry. I-I had plans to have tea with H-Hilda already. Though…she might be okay with you joining?" </p><p> </p><p>"Glad to hear, I'll make sure to bring some treats," Byleth responded, before leaving with a nod. </p><p> </p><p>Giving a small wave in response, Marianne took in a small breath. She might not be worthy of this kindness, but maybe coming to the Academy was worth it...</p><hr /><p>Seteth walked the monastery halls with a look of intense concentration on his face while he read some papers in hand. Everyone nearby gave him a wide berth as he walked; no one wanted to get in the way of the stern chamberlain on the best of days, and they definitely didn’t want to be in his way when he looked so focused. Surely, for someone so important to the function of the church, his task must be something of grand importance, so he should not be interrupted. And, perhaps to him, it was indeed quite important. </p><p> </p><p>For he was stuck on the fable he was currently writing. </p><p> </p><p>He had to admit, it was rather annoying how he couldn't get that idea Professor Byleth had used as a metaphor out of his head. As such, he felt it necessary to approach her to ask if she could expound upon that metaphor she used. </p><p> </p><p>At least, that's what he thought, until he saw her wearing a student’s uniform, idly chatting with Balthus as she did. </p><p> </p><p>"Professor, what are you wearing!?" Seteth practically yelled as he approached the two. </p><p> </p><p>"Why do people keep asking that? It should be obvious,” Byleth responded in lieu of an answer. </p><p> </p><p>"And it should also be obvious why you shouldn't wear such a thing!" </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, come on, lighten up and just appreciate the view, pal," Balthus said with a grin, which faltered when Seteth glared at him. </p><p> </p><p>"Balthus, was it? I understand you may be older than the average student, but you are a student of this academy once again, so making such comments about a professor is inappropriate." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, right." </p><p> </p><p>"I thought it looked cute," Byleth muttered to herself, pouting, earning an annoyed look from Seteth.</p><p> </p><p>"'Cuteness' has no bearing on this conversation! You can't be wearing a student's uniform while you're a professor!"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh. Hm." Well that sounded unfair to her, though she ignored that feeling in favor of focusing back on the chamberlain. "Did you need something, Seteth?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yes, I did want to speak with you about something. Do you have some time?" </p><p> </p><p>"Sure, take care, Balthus." </p><p> </p><p>"Will do, see you," Balthus said, making sure to avoid saying anything inappropriate in front of Seteth. </p><p> </p><p>As Seteth left with Byleth in tow, the chamberlain couldn't help but think about the professor at his side. He might not know all the details, but…he had heard enough of the situation in Abyss. It was odd to hear that Rhea had apparently had someone she…saw as a daughter. In the eighteen years he had been there, Rhea hadn't once mentioned Sitri. Not that he could blame her, Seteth wasn't really one to speak about his wife either. Even so…</p><p> </p><p>Was she really just someone she had adopted? Her body had been perfectly preserved, something that wasn't normal for humans, but…it was for Nabateans. Had Rhea found someone and had a child? Was that why she was so willing to trust Byleth…? </p><p> </p><p>It was odd to think of the former mercenary as someone he could trust but…if she was family, then maybe he could extend some trust. </p><p> </p><p>"So, what did you want to talk about?" Byleth asked as they found an empty place to talk. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, well, I wanted to ask about that metaphor you said some time ago. About the Silverheart mercenaries." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh? Any reason why?" </p><p> </p><p>"My own interest I suppose you could say," Seteth responded. "Specifically, I wished to know if you had any particular idea on how things could progress from the story you described." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I was thinking about how it could have a happy ending, if possible. If we add in 'House Verdant' then that would be three houses that each have their own tensions with one another." </p><p> </p><p>"Well…I suppose finding a reason to work together would be one." </p><p> </p><p>"So you say, but it seems faith hasn't been working as a reason to unite." </p><p> </p><p>"That's because Faith isn't tangible." At his confused expression, Byleth continued. "Faith…from what I've seen is different for everyone. For some, it's a source of comfort. For others, it could be a motivator. It can be a sword or a shield depending on who wields it. Especially with how they view it." </p><p> </p><p>"How so?" </p><p> </p><p>"Take me for example. I'm not exceptionally faithful, but I can still use faith magic, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"...yes, that is quite peculiar." </p><p> </p><p>"I don't think so. When I consider this type of magic…I have faith in my family, and in those I care about. Even so, I want to make sure to keep them safe," Byleth explained, "There are also those who use faith for negative means, like the Western Church who infiltrated the monastery during the Rite of Rising, or the Southern Church who tried to enact an insurrection." </p><p> </p><p>"And those people are heretics who went against the goddess' teachings." </p><p> </p><p>"Even so, they still had 'faith', even if it's in heretical things. So if faith is to be something that brings everyone together, then it needs to be something tangible, like if the goddess were to descend again." </p><p> </p><p>"...Hm." Well, it would be a deus ex machina for the goddess to suddenly descend and put an end to the conflict, but it is a children's fable… "I see. Thank you for your input." </p><p> </p><p>"No problem. Did you need anything else?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not at the moment. Though I will say that you really should change, such attire isn't appropriate for a professor of the Academy." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, okay," Byleth said as Seteth walked away. She had to admit, she was kind of disappointed that her experiment with fashion went so poorly.</p><p> </p><p>Well at least her usual outfit was perfectly appropriate to wear.</p><hr /><p>"Oh, professor, any reason for the change back to your usual outfit?" Dorothea asked, having nearly bumped into Byleth as the latter was entering the cafeteria as the former was leaving. </p><p> </p><p>Shrugging in response, Byleth looked down at herself. "Apparently my clothes weren't appropriate, and I kept getting stared at." </p><p> </p><p>"Really?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I know I'm not really someone that knows alot of fashion, but I thought I looked cute," Byleth said before frowning. "Though I guess I was wrong. Lorenz saw me earlier, and said something about how Sylvain was missing out by not being here before laughing in his usual way." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Dorothea tried not to immediately jump to conclusions, because she didn't think Lorenz was <em> that </em>much of an asshole. She'd still talk with him later, but for now she focused on Byleth. "Well I thought you looked cute." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, thank you." </p><p> </p><p>"No need to thank me, professor. Though, you really shouldn't take what others say to heart like that. You should wear what you want, and I definitely think you should wear that outfit again~." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…Still, I suppose it would be better if I had a better idea on fashion. Would you be able to help me with that?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh? You want my help?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah? You seem very trendy, and you did pick out this hairband for me," Byleth explained, reaching up to touch said gift. "So I think you'd be able to help me pick out cute outfits." </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, I'm touched, professor! Though I will say, I didn't think you'd like that hairband so much." </p><p> </p><p>"Why wouldn't I? You got it for me as a gift." </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, well in that case, I certainly don't mind helping you out later."</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Dorothea. Ah, though I can wait until you have free time from your dates.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no need to worry there, my schedule is quite free at the moment,” Dorothea responded, refraining from mentioning she had been turning down dates while Byleth was recovering so she could check up on her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay. Hm…what kind of outfits would be good for this weather anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, what do you normally wear when it’s hot out?”</p><p> </p><p>“This.”</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea probably should have seen that coming. “Then that’s a good starting point! I’m sure we can find plenty of shorts and short skirts around, though we might have a bit more trouble finding tops that show off your chest like that. The clothes around here do tend to be on the more modest side, though I will say you can really pull off a blouse, professor~”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yes? It’s pretty easy, they come with buttons.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” It was times like these that Dorothea remembered Professor Byleth and Shez were sisters. “I mean you look very cute in a blouse, professor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Ah, thank you. Hm…I guess a blouse and a skirt would be good teaching clothes…Then again, Manuela wears that dress…I wonder how that would look…”</p><p> </p><p>“...A-Ahem.” Dorothea cleared her throat to get Professor Byleth’s attention and interrupt that line of thought before she did something dangerous like actually dress like Manuela. Such a sight might actually kill poor Edie…and possibly other members of the Eagles class, based on how many of them couldn’t help but stare whenever the professor was facing away from them. Though, to be fair, with those hips of hers in that tight skirt…She was getting distracted again. “Let’s save asking Manuela for fashion advice for later.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, should we? She does look pretty…but a lot of people tend to stare at her too. Hm.” Byleth frowned, thinking. “...I wonder how Shez is doing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sorry. My mind drifted a little. I just remembered one time after I bought this outfit and we were going through a town in Leicester, I think around Siward. Some guy made rude comments and Shez punched him in the face.” A faint smile graced her features. “It was funny. He didn’t seem to realize he’d been knocked out until a second afterward and then collapsed like a sack. Then his friend tried to grab Shez and I broke his arm. I think we’re still banned from that bar.”</p><p> </p><p>Her smile grew. “Papa was pretty proud of us after that, though he tried to pretend he wasn’t. Victor said we should celebrate it, since it’s apparently an ‘Eisner Family Tradition’.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pff-” Dorothea tried to stifle her laugh. “To get kicked out of bars?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup. Papa–Ah, Jeralt has been banned from at least five bars in every nation, from what he’s told me. Though most of them are because he never pays his tabs.”</p><p> </p><p>That time, Dorothea couldn’t help but giggle. “Hahaha! Your father is quite the character! Though don’t worry, I’m sure Shezzie isn’t going to be starting any bar brawls since the Lions have those knights escorting them.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hm. Knights of Seiros can go to bars, can’t they?”</p><p> </p><p>“Professor, even if they can, I don’t think they’re going to while they’re on a mission.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…Well hopefully they don't, the kingdom doesn't really have a drinking age I think." </p><p> </p><p>"They don't?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not that I could see. Though I imagine when you live in a place where you get thrown in rivers in full armor to train as a kid, they don't really care when you drink." </p><p> </p><p>"...The kingdom actually does that?"</p><p> </p><p>"From what I read, yeah. It seems very dangerous though, since it gets cold up there." </p><p> </p><p>"...Huh. Well, I guess being a knight in the Kingdom definitely won't be part of my future plans." </p><p> </p><p>"I would hope not, because then you'd probably transfer over to the Blue Lions." </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, is that your way of saying you'd miss me?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course. I'd miss any of you if you went to a different class." </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, well don't worry, I definitely don't have any plans to leave. Even if I end up finding someone to sweep me off my feet in a different class, I'll still be part of the Black Eagles~" </p><p> </p><p>Dorothea meant every word of that too, but when she saw Byleth smile brightly at her reassurance, she found herself getting all the more resolved. No matter what happened, she wanted to be by the professor’s side.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Shez still really hated the cold in Faerghus. It wasn’t too bad at the moment, since the moon being Verdant Rain meant they were in summer instead of the still fairly chilly spring, but Faerghus as a whole just seemed to permeate cold whenever she visited. It didn’t help that it was the rainy season too, so they had to delay their march a couple times to take shelter when it got too heavy.</p><p> </p><p>Apparently rain in cold areas could mean hail started falling instead of water, which just confirmed for Shez that only crazy people actually wanted to live in Faerghus.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t help that the mood was still really heavy. Felix’s dad had come by to visit so he was in a worse mood than usual and being annoyingly surly, which seemed to be putting Sylvain and Ingrid more on edge than they already were. Though at least those two seemed to still be fine with each other; really, Ingrid seemed to be being nicer to him in general after that talk they had, so at least things hadn’t fallen apart there.</p><p> </p><p>Then there was Gilbert, their escorting knight for the mission. Also known as the guy who couldn’t more obviously be Annette’s father if he tried. And he really wasn’t trying.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Gilbert, mind if we talk?" Shez asked as she went up to him. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Did you need to ask something about the mission?" the knight asked as he rested while they waited for the rain to stop. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I wanted to ask, you're Annette's dad, right?" That seemed like a bad question to ask as it made the already stern-faced knight frown.</p><p> </p><p>"Unless you have something to ask about the mission, then you should focus on resting." </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, it was just a simple question-" </p><p> </p><p>"If that is all, then I ask you to leave me be." With that he turned away, making it very clear he didn't want to talk with her anymore. </p><p> </p><p>"..." Turning around, Shez walked over to Annette. "Annette, your dad sucks." </p><p> </p><p>“H-Hey! Shez, you shouldn’t say that!” she complained, “He’s still my dad…”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well, you deserve better than someone who doesn’t want to be,” Shez grumbled, before noticing the hurt look on Annette’s face. “Ah, I’m sorry. It’s just that you really do deserve better. He’s a grown man, he shouldn’t be ignoring you like this.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I know. But…But he’s still my dad, and I still want him to be my dad. You know?”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess…Maybe it’d help if I hit him?”</p><p> </p><p>Annette blinked, then giggled. “Shez, you can’t just punch my dad to make him acknowledge me.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, see, that’s the smart part. It’s not just one punch, I’m gonna keep beating him up until he’s finally ready to go home and be a family man.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think that’s how that works, Shez. Also you really shouldn’t try to beat up a Knight of Seiros, you can get in trouble for that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not if he doesn’t know it was me. I could wear a mask. Oh, or put a bag over his head!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Annette gave her a concerned look. “I think you might be taking this idea too seriously, Shez. Please don’t actually beat up my dad. I’ll just…try to work this out myself, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, if you insist. But seriously, if you ever want me to punch him, just ask. I’ve already made the same offer to Bernadetta, I don’t mind extending it to anyone else with parental problems,” Shez said, before pausing, “Well, maybe not Felix, his issues with his dad seem more complicated than his dad just being a jerk.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, my issues are complicated too!” Annette pouted.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sure, but I think punching your dad would actually help you, whereas Felix would probably prefer to punch his dad himself if it came to it.”</p><p> </p><p>“...that does sound like Felix…”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Annie, hello Shez,” Mercedes greeted as she came over to their part of the overhang. “What are you two chatting about?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, bad dads and my offer to beat them up if requested.”</p><p> </p><p>Annette giggled. “Yeah, Shez thinks it might help with, well…yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, well I would not mind helping out in that case. I can certainly heal Sir Gilbert up afterwards, so you can feel free to go all out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pff–Mercie, come on! Don’t encourage her!”</p><p> </p><p>Shez grinned. “Aw, but I respond way better to positive reinforcement! Actually, hey, Mercedes, do you have any bad parental figures that need beating up? If you’ve got good folks, the offer doesn’t apply, but I will beat up anybody else as offered!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no, you don’t need to. Thank you for the offer though.” Mercedes smiled. “I’ll make sure to tell you if I need anyone beaten up, though I don’t think it is very likely I’ll need that help.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, but like I said, the offer still stands!” The two girls giggled again and Shez felt herself grin, her mood lightened a bit. Though she did notice Mercedes seemed a bit wistful. "Everything good there, Mercedes?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yes, I'm just…thinking about something back at the monastery." </p><p> </p><p>"Anything I can help with?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, just…someone I need to talk with, and I've been trying to work up the courage to do so." Mercedes gave the two a small smile. "I think when we get back, I might try to talk with them." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, well good luck, hope it all goes well!"</p><p> </p><p>Though her good humor didn’t last too much longer as they continued their march to Conand Tower. Well, half-march, half-ride. The Church provided horses, which made things easier as the Blue Lions made their way towards the abandoned fort set between Fraldarius and Galatea territory.</p><p> </p><p>Sylvain’s mood seemed to only get worse the closer they got to the fort, while Gilbert continued to stonewall Shez’s attempt to speak with him, and honestly she was just not in the mood to even bother asking what was up with Felix and his dad right now. Which meant she ended up riding near Ashe as Annette and Mercedes chatted with one another. </p><p> </p><p>"So… how have you been, Ashe?" the young mercenary asked, feeling a bit awkward since she hadn't talked with her friend one-on-one since the Gaspard mission. </p><p> </p><p>"Doing better, I think. My siblings got taken in by the local church and they seem to like it based on the letters I've gotten," Ashe responded, even as his hands trembled as they gripped the reins. "Ah, but have you heard what's happened to the Western Church?" </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, I heard they were the ones behind the assassination plot, but aside from the ones who got captured and executed, I don't know much else." </p><p> </p><p>"From what I've heard, several members of the Western Church have been arrested, and they've already been replaced, handpicked by the Royal Mage Cornelia and Regent Rufus." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh… that's pretty fast isn't it? I mean, I'm not sure how church stuff works, but replacing important people takes time, right?"</p><p> </p><p>"Officially, they haven't fully replaced them," Ingrid explained as she rode near. "Lady Rhea has yet to give them her blessing, but Cornelia is someone highly important to the Kingdom, so I wouldn't doubt her choices getting the okay." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh… who exactly is Cornelia? All I know is what Sylvain told me, and well, it's Sylvain." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not even going to ask. For reference, Cornelia is a great mage who saved the Kingdom from a plague before," Ingrid explained after letting out a sigh. "Her word carries great weight, so it may take some time, but I'm sure the Western Church will have a new bishop soon enough." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh. Well, it's none of my business at least. We can talk more about this when we get back, after we deal with the bandits. Will say, as much as the rain sucks, it's gonna be handy for the attack." </p><p> </p><p>"Really? How so?" </p><p> </p><p>"In my experience, anytime the weather sucks, the bandits on watch tend to slack off. Not to mention from what they told us, if they recently pillaged, they're probably getting drunk off their asses." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh, I guess Professor Byleth didn't get all the brains."</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, I'm smart sometimes too!" </p><p> </p><p>"Tell that to your grades," Ingrid shot back, getting Ashe to laugh. </p><p> </p><p>Grumbling to herself, Shez stayed silent until the march came to a stop and the tower came into view. It's not her fault she couldn't remember the name of some random general during that test. "Wow, that thing is huge." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, seems like the perfect place to turn into a bandit base. Already fortified, and gives you a view in every direction," Sylvain muttered as Professor Hanneman came up to the students after talking with Gilbert. </p><p> </p><p>"Alright class, from what the scouting knights have informed us, there doesn't seem to be anyone on watch outside the tower, but we must still approach with caution as they can still see us from inside the tower. Gilbert shall be leading the charge into the tower, but we are not to solely rely on him." </p><p> </p><p>"From what we were told, it seems all of the bandits are inside the tower, so we shall be focusing on reinforcing our vanguard," Dimitri said, "Shez, Ingrid, can I trust you to protect us as our rearguard?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, your highness!" </p><p> </p><p>"Sure, though feel free to ask for help if it proves too much for you guys," Shez responded as she got off the horse. </p><p> </p><p>"Arrogance leads to mistakes," Gilbert intoned, wielding a greatshield. "Experienced mercenary or not, you would do well to remember that." </p><p> </p><p>"Right," Shez deadpanned as her classmates got ready for combat. Though she had to admit, this was the first time she was going up against someone with a relic weapon, so she couldn't help but wonder how that would go. </p><hr /><p>Badly. It would go badly. But not in the way anybody expected.</p><p> </p><p>As far as the actual bandit fight went, it was standard fare; the goons at the bottom of the tower were all drunk, so they were easy to take out, and from there it was a matter of clearing the way up the tower to where the bandit’s boss lurked. The thing is though, fortresses were made to be hard to invade. It came with the territory of being important strongholds for a nation’s army, and the long, winding path towards the center turned their assault into a slog, especially as more problems made themselves apparent.</p><p> </p><p>The first being that there were a lot of bandits and plenty of them were much better equipped than the Lions expected. There even were a few fully decked out in genuinely tough platemail, looking like proper, if dingy, armored knights. </p><p> </p><p>Adding onto that was the second problem, which was that the fortress was built so soldiers on the upper levels had view of the lower levels, which meant once one of the bandits happened to notice Gilbert stomping along, the alarm was raised and suddenly those surprisingly well-equipped bandits were coming straight down to meet Shez and her friends.</p><p> </p><p>And then, of course, there was the third problem: reinforcements from the lower levels, who proved to be the biggest pains in the ass as they nearly pincered Shez’s class between them and the goons on the upper levels.</p><p> </p><p>Still, things went well enough. Professor Hanneman was smart and made sure everyone was well-equipped to handle the threats coming their way and despite Gilbert being about as subtle as a brick, he was actually pretty hardy and did a good job of helping them deal with the sudden ambushes from behind. Though he did also fall behind because he was a slow old man, so…</p><p> </p><p>Anyway, the Blue Lions managed to get their way to the top well enough, which meant it wasn’t long before they came face to face with Miklan, boss of the bandits and Sylvain’s disowned brother.</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell is this?” growled the scarred redhead, glaring out at the students from his spot on the upper floor. The lance in his hand was unmistakably a relic, one with an actual crest stone in it, unlike Byleth’s new sword. “Did those self-righteous dastards really send a bunch of noble brats to come steal my damn birthright?!”</p><p> </p><p>"Pretty sure you lost the right to that years ago," Sylvain said, getting the glare focused onto him. </p><p> </p><p>"<em> You. </em>Of course you would come to ruin something else for me," the bandit leader growled out, venom dripping from every word, “If it weren’t for you–!” </p><p> </p><p>"Just shut up already! I'm tired of hearing you blaming me for something that isn't my fault!" </p><p> </p><p>"Then I'll just kill you! Slaughter the men and capture the women, but leave that one for me!" Miklan shouted, ordering his men as he pointed at Sylvain with the lance. With that, the final battle of the tower broke out.</p><p> </p><p>Shez had to admit, even though he was complete scum who deserved execution, Miklan was a surprisingly tough fighter. The fact he had heavy armor and a relic probably helped, but from what she saw of his moves, the man knew how to fight and had actual training instead of the improvised styles most bandits developed. </p><p> </p><p>Not that she actually fought him; whatever he and Sylvain had going on seemed way too personal, so she stuck to taking down the remaining bandits while Sylvain and Dimitri took the lead on breaking through the dastard’s defenses and scoring actual hits that pushed him back further and further as the weapon in his hand glowed brighter and brighter.</p><p> </p><p>Thunder boomed outside the tower as Miklan snarled another insult towards his foes…and then the stone began to bleed. Black liquid surged up Miklan’s arm as though it were alive, and it wasn’t long before the bandit started screaming as it dug under his armor and into his skin.</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell…” Sylvain breathed, staring as the Lance of Ruin consumed his brother. </p><p> </p><p>Miklan screamed one last time as the liquid surged up over his head and dug into his eyes, and then something else started screaming.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that…So this is where those creatures originate from,” Arval muttered in Shez’s mind while she stared at the black demonic beast that had just formed right in front of them. “I should have known. What a foul existence.”</p><p> </p><p>The monstrosity roared, spit dripping from it’s massive maw before it surged forward, its massive hand lunging down to grab one of the bandits that hadn’t retreated yet.</p><p> </p><p>“W-Wha–N-No! Boss–!” </p><p> </p><p>A sickening crunch echoed out as the black beast smashed its prey against the ground before throwing the broken corpse against a wall. There was no longer any intelligence in its gleaming red eyes, not even a hunger for flesh like others of its kind. All it had was malice, and it was directed right at Shez and her classmates.</p><p> </p><p>“Your highness, get behind me!” Gilbert ordered, stepping in front of Dimitri–Who just pushed past him without hesitating.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s no time for that! This beast is a threat to everyone here! And if we allow it to escape, it will be a threat to everyone in Faerghus!” Dimitri gazed up at the beast, his grip tightening on his spear. “I’m sorry it had to come to this, but there’s no way back now. This monster has to die.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s being awfully dramatic right now,” Arval noted, unimpressed, before floating beside Shez, “Well, partner? You’ve dealt with creatures like this before. Shouldn’t you lend your expertise?”</p><p> </p><p>“Should I? This one’s kind of different.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you referring to your classmate’s personal investment or the beast’s black hide? Either way, it doesn’t change the fact that it needs to die. And that your classmates have little heed for tactics.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not exactly the tactical type either, Arval,” Shez muttered, before grinning a little, “Though I guess that makes me the right girl for the job here. HEY DIMITRI!”</p><p> </p><p>The prince paused, glancing over at his classmate just as her shout caught the beast’s attention. “What is it, Shez?”</p><p> </p><p>“Big guy’s like these take a lot of hits, but sometimes their hides are weaker to certain weapons! Plus, the more you wear ‘em down, the easier they get! So I’m gonna distract it while you guys skewer it!”</p><p> </p><p>“Distract it!?” Hanneman exclaimed, the professor catching up right in time for him to hear Shez’s brilliant plan. “Young lady, now isn’t the time for heroics–”</p><p> </p><p>And then Shez let loose her awakened form, her eyes and hair glowing a fiery orange while white markings appeared across her face before she rushed straight in, moving faster and hitting harder as she scored deep cuts across the beast’s hide.</p><p> </p><p>“...Could she always do that?” Annette asked as their classmate carved through the thick armor of a massive demonic beast.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yes, she could,” Hanneman noted, “It came up during the crest examination and she used it during the mock battle, though I did not realize her empowered form was this effective…Ah, and we really should be helping her now. Come on students, we have a beast to put down!”</p><p> </p><p>Massive monstrosity though it might be, the black beast soon found its intimidating entrance didn’t quite live up to its ability, at least when it came to several people surrounding it and repeatedly attacking its increasing weak points. Every wound Shez left on its body was another opening for the others to strike at. Lances plunged into open wounds, arrows sunk into its flesh, magic rained down on its head, and all the while, Shez kept ripping gaping tears straight through the beast’s hide until it was a screeching, writhing mess, too disoriented to do little more than flail at whatever last caused it pain.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, that flailing was still extremely dangerous, so it was best that the students keep their distance, but it wasn’t long before the thing was stumbling, its struggles getting weaker by the second.</p><p> </p><p>“...Can’t say I wanted it to end like this,” Sylvain muttered, staring at the pitiful wreck his brother had become.</p><p> </p><p>“Nor can I,” Dimitri agreed, “But there is nothing more we can do than end his misery.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, you’re right.”</p><p> </p><p>And with that, the two friends took advantage of the beast’s stunned state to drive their lances up into its chest, piercing what would have been its heart, were it still human. Whatever they hit was still vital though, and the pair stepped back to avoid the beast’s death throes as its screeching turned more pitiful than intimidating.</p><p> </p><p>Then the beast died, and its form burst away, leaving only the corpse of Miklan with the Lance of Ruin in his limp hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Goddess…the beast is gone, yet Miklan and the lance remain,” Gilbert muttered at the sight, “What sort of–”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, is it over?” Shez asked, startling the knight as she suddenly appeared by his side, “Huh, that was convenient, it usually takes a lot more effort to get rid of the corpse, wow.”</p><p> </p><p>To the surprise of most there, Sylvain snorted at Shez’s statement. “Well we’ve still gotta bury the body, so if you really want to get on that…”</p><p> </p><p>“Awww, but I hate that part,” Shez complained as everyone noticed her markings were still in place. And that one of her swords had actually broken during the fight.</p><p> </p><p>“...Were you cutting through that beast’s hide with a broken sword?” Dimitri asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Hm, yeah, looks like it, that’s kind of funny, though now I need a new sword, can I have yours?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Pardon?”</p><p> </p><p>Sylvain couldn’t help it. “C’mon Dimitri, a girl asked for your sword. You should know what to do in this situation.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Sylvain, your brother’s dead on the floor right there. Is now really the time?”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh, it’s what he would’ve wanted.”</p><p> </p><p>“What??”</p><p> </p><p>“Or, well, it’s what I want and I just hate his guts even now, so yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri sighed as Ingrid came up to Sylvain. Rather than slap him upside the head though, the blonde just took Sylvain by the wrist and started leading him away, earning a confused blink from the redhead before he just decided to allow it and followed his friend.</p><p> </p><p>“...So have you been holding back in all of our spars?” Felix asked with a scowl, prompting a glance from Shez.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, duh, I would kill you if I didn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Felix scowled even deeper at that statement, then turned his glare towards the sword in Shez’s hand. “Hmph. Show me your sword.”</p><p> </p><p>“No. I don’t like the way you asked that. Say please.”</p><p> </p><p>“Er, Shez, is your…current state influencing your thoughts at all?” Dimitri asked, earning a pause from his glowing classmate before the glow suddenly faded and she shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Bleh. Okay, I’m good. Did I insult anybody?”</p><p> </p><p>“You said you would kill me if you fought me seriously,” Felix stated, still irritated.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Ah, well, the thing is, I probably would? Like, if we fought, fought, I’d probably be trying to kill you, right?” She paused, thinking. “Though, then again, you’re a noble and Victor always says you should aim to capture nobles alive for a ransom.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Are you sure your mental state isn’t still being altered?” Dimitri asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? No, I think I’m good. So are we cutting off Miklan’s head for this job or what?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hm. No, I do not believe that is necessary. Let’s just retrieve the relic and be on our way.”</p><p> </p><p>"Uh, you sure that's safe? We just saw someone get turned into a giant monster from wielding it." </p><p> </p><p>"Hence why Sylvain will be holding it, since he has the crest of Gautier. What we saw was a punishment of the goddess for wielding a relic weapon without a crest, so Sylvain will be safe." </p><p> </p><p>"...if you say so,” Shez agreed with a shrug, “Gotta say, this crest stuff is really weird." </p><p> </p><p>"Do you require another lesson?" Hanneman asked as the Blue Lions made their way back down the tower, all while the knights cleared away the bodies behind them.</p><p> </p><p>"No, just…it's weird I guess. All this happened because he didn't have a crest?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, it did,” Dimitri said, “While I do not agree with Margrave Gautier for disinheriting Miklan, it is true that crests are of grave importance to the kingdom. They are the blades we use to fight off invaders and to keep our lands safe. The Gautiers have long since held off invaders from Sreng, which grants them many special privileges in the Kingdom, but, as such, it is necessary for the heirs of Gautier to bear their crest, so they may wield the relic weapon." </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, I get that, but are they really that important?” Shez asked, “I mean, I've met many strong people who don't have crests, and just cause you have a crest doesn't mean you’re strong." </p><p> </p><p>"In that, we can agree on. A crest alone cannot be used to measure ability, but even so, there's a reason this tradition has stood the test of time. If we didn't put any stock into crests, then bloodlines with the crests would dwindle, and the blades we use to defend our land would soon be forgotten." </p><p> </p><p>"I dunno, that seems like it's mainly just affecting you nobles. It's like you said, a crest isn't a measure of ability, so it shouldn’t also be something people rely on so much." </p><p> </p><p>"To be clear," Hanneman interjected. "As a Holy Kingdom, Faerghus is able to enjoy its sovereignty by the blessing of the goddess and the Church of Seiros. To turn away from those blessings could be tantamount to blasphemy, in the eyes of some." </p><p> </p><p>"I guess? Still seems weird to me." </p><p> </p><p>"I suppose it must be because your father's mercenary band hasn't really traveled in Faerghus often,” Dimitri considered, “Though I will say, House Gautier is a bit of an exception. Other house heads from different families have been known to not have crests. Ingrid's father, for example, bears no crest." </p><p> </p><p>"Though Miss Ingrid does have a lot of responsibility on her shoulders as the only one of her siblings to have a crest," Hanneman inputted. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, perhaps things would have been simpler if her elder siblings or Miklan had also been born with crests," Dimitri said with a sigh, getting Shez to stop walking.</p><p> </p><p>"...Dimitri, I know you mean well, but you really say some stupid shit sometimes." </p><p> </p><p>The prince blinked. “Pardon?”</p><p> </p><p>“If Miklan was born with a crest, Sylvain wouldn’t exist,” Shez bluntly explained, “And I don’t know as much about Ingrid’s family, but do you think she would exist either if any of her brothers had been born with crests? Because from how it sounds, noble families up here only seem to have as many kids as they need to in order to get an heir with a crest.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…well, that is not entirely correct. Duke Fraldarius had Felix after his first son was revealed to have a crest, so–”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, but is that what would’ve happened with Sylvain’s dad? Or Ingrid’s family? Would either of your friends exist if their siblings had crests?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Dimitri sighed, then tried to smile. “Well, I’ll admit, you make a fair point. Dwelling on ‘what if’ doesn’t really help, does it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope. What happened, happened, and you just have to deal with it from that point on.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yes, that is very true,” he murmured, his head lowering in thought, all while he tried to ignore the whispers in the back of his mind, speaking in the voices of the long dead. Dwelling on ‘What if’ would not help any of them…</p><hr /><p>The trip back to the monastery was rather uneventful, as the rain finally let up, allowing them to return faster. The only thing of note was Gilbert leaving the group as he went to help the villagers who had lost their homes thanks to the bandits. Shez understood why he was doing it, but at the same time, it meant Annette lost her chance to talk to her dad until he showed up at the monastery again. </p><p> </p><p>Sylvain was also a bit more quiet, the young man trailing behind the group as he had the lance of Ruin on his back. Apparently Hanneman was going to make a case for him being able to keep the spear at the request of his father, which Rhea probably wasn't going to be happy with. Honestly Shez still thought it was probably a better idea to lock it away with what happened to Miklan, but it wasn't her decision. </p><p> </p><p>Speaking of her decisions…</p><p> </p><p>"So, are you actually going to transfer classes?" Ingrid asked. </p><p> </p><p>"...Yeah, I think I am. Nothing against you guys, but I think this was just a bad year to join the Blue Lions, you know?" </p><p> </p><p>"I can understand that at least. It was certainly hectic. Don't think this means I'll go easy on you during the Battle of Eagle and Lion. Though, do you mind telling me which class you're joining?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not sure. Either class seems like a good choice, if I'm being honest. Though I imagine you'd prefer it if I joined the Golden Deer." </p><p> </p><p>"...If I'm being honest, yes." </p><p> </p><p>"Mind telling me why exactly you don't like the Black Eagles?" </p><p> </p><p>"It's not them specifically, just more so the Empire in general. You know about the Tragedy of Duscur, right?" At her nod, Ingrid continued. "Back then, many people lost their lives… including Felix's brother and… my fiance, Glenn." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, uh, my bad. Didn't mean to bring up bad memories like that." </p><p> </p><p>"It's alright, I should talk about this… back then, when it first occurred, I hated the people of Duscur. I still carry some anger there, really, but…rumors started to spread that the people of the Empire were behind it, in some misbegotten revenge for their regent who passed away in an accident. At that, my anger could only grow. Why would they target so many for something that was just an accident? Why did so many great people have to die…" </p><p> </p><p>"That… I guess I can see what you mean. If Byleth was killed I'd be angry too, but they're just rumors, yeah? And like, the tragedy happened four years ago, right? Pretty sure everyone in the Black Eagles still would have been kids back then… well, maybe aside from Hubert, that dude looks like he's been alive longer than my dad," Shez said, cracking a joke and making Ingrid laugh. </p><p> </p><p>"...You know, Petra said something similar. For the longest time I wasn't sure why she'd be okay with working alongside the people who subjugated hers, but I think I get it." Ingrid shook her head with a rueful smile. "If nothing else, I'll trust that your sister is a good judge of character." </p><p> </p><p>"You should, By might not act like it, but she picks up on things easily!" </p><p> </p><p>"I suppose so," Ingrid agreed, before glancing over at Dedue. "...I should probably talk to Dedue when I get the chance." </p><p> </p><p>"Well we're almost back, so you'll have plenty of chances," Shez replied as they arrived at the town surrounding the monastery. "But I think I'll focus on taking a warm bath first." </p><p> </p><p>"Never quite developed that cold blood huh?" </p><p> </p><p>"Nope! The warmer the better!" Shez said, smiling before she noticed a blonde girl approaching the group with flowers. She seemed kinda familiar, but she didn’t look like a student, considering the white blouse and navy blue skirt she was wearing weren’t from the usual uniform. </p><p> </p><p>"Here you go Dedue, happy birthday." Huh, that sounded a lot like–did her hair just turn red? </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, thank you?" Dedue asked, unsure of who was handing him flowers as the girl nodded in response. </p><p> </p><p>"How'd the mission go, Shez?" she asked as her hair turned brown.</p><p> </p><p>"...By, is that you?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Why is your hair changing colors!?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, right." As if finally acknowledging her now black hair, Byleth grabbed a few strands. "It's a spell Constance did. It should be gone in a day or two, apparently." </p><p> </p><p>"And the new outfit??" </p><p> </p><p>"Do you like it?" Byleth asked, looking down at herself. "Dorothea helped pick it out for me. I felt like getting some new clothes." </p><p> </p><p>"...I'm joining the Black Eagles." </p><p> </p><p>"Sylvain!" </p><p> </p><p>"What?? Can you blame me??" </p><p> </p><p>"No, but I can hit you." </p>

  <p>
  <span>“Pss pss pss! C’mon kitty!” Shez encouraged, trying to get the cute little black kitty cat to pay attention to her. “Ugh, By makes this look so easy…do I need to get on my back? Is that it? I swear, she can just lay down and suddenly there’s a cat using her chest as its pillow–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez? What are you…doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then glanced over at the sudden voice interrupting her catcalling, in a more literal sense of the word. “Oh, hey princess. What’s up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I believe that is what I was asking you,” Edelgard replied with a small frown, before she noticed a familiar kitty lazily watching the violet-haired student, “...Are you bothering this kit–ah, this cat?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I’m not bothering him! Well, I think. I’m just trying to get the kitty cat to come over to me. Byleth pets these little guys all the time and I wanted to get in on that. Though, I'm not having much luck," Shez explained, before turning back to the kitty. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she did, she let out a small gasp as she saw the cat get up and slowly approach her. Only for it to walk right past her and rub up against Edelgard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Edelgard tried to keep an even face as Shez looked up at her with a look of complete betrayal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Is this because I teased you back at the abyss?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I am not doing this on purpose," Edelgard defended herself, feeling a bit bad as she ignored the meowing Whiskerton. "Regardless, I didn't know you liked cats." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I guess they're okay. Just keeping myself busy," Shez responded a little mulishly, though she still scooted over and a big grin spread across her face once she managed to pet the kitty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, the mission today was my last with the Blue Lions. Starting tomorrow, I'm officially a Golden Deer." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, I'm surprised you didn't ask to join the Black Eagles if you were planning to switch classes. I do remember you asking to join near the start of the year." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, maybe later in the year, but as is, I'm just trying to have fun." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Attending a prestigious academy is certainly not a place that most people would go to have fun." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, but it's not like I joined willingly." Letting out a huff, Shez stood up, which prompted a small, unamused mew from Whiskerton. "Besides, I'm already a professional mercenary. Aside from making some friends, it's not like I'll get anything big from being here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The future leaders of the three nations are currently attending, so I wouldn't say you would not get anything." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And it's not like I'm going to swear loyalty to them," Shez responded, "Like, if the school were to suddenly shut down or something, it's not like I'm going to stay over in Derdriu with Claude. If he had any immediate problems I'd help him out, but I'd leave right afterwards to meet up with By. Or vice versa, I guess, if By comes to meet me first." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…but wouldn’t having a noble patron be a boon for a mercenary?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, it’d probably be great, but my family has always been fine traveling around. I don’t know how long dad’s going to stick with this Knight Captain thing, but my plan is to go wherever Byleth goes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what if she were to stay at this Academy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused, then shrugged. “Then I guess I’ll wander around for a bit. I could stick around here, maybe, but I could probably get some work with some of the people I’ve met here, right? Maybe work for Dimitri for a year or two, then hop over to Claude? Or hey, if you’re paying, I wouldn’t mind working for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You really do have a remarkably mercenary mindset."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, yeah. I was one even before I met By and Dad." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You were?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I didn't see much fighting back then, but it was pretty much all I could do after mom died. Mom didn't really talk with anyone from the village, so no one was that interested in taking me in," Shez explained, "Hell, I'm lucky dad decided to keep me around, or else I'd have to wander around till I found another group to work with." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…that sounds rather sad." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, but it comes with the territory. I don't have to worry about my family or the 'officers' cuz they're strong, but new faces keep coming and going for one reason or another. If I worried about trying to keep everyone alive, then I'd get stuck in a rut. That's why it's By’s job to keep everyone alive, while it's mine to make sure there's no one around to hurt them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…and if you were to end up on opposite sides?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not happening. There's not enough money in the world to make me want to fight against By in a war." At that, Shez grinned. "We're a package deal, you want one you gotta hire the other." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I'll certainly keep that in mind." And she would. The sisters were plainly loyal to one another, more than anyone outside of their family. That could be leveraged easily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert would probably suggest holding one hostage to ensure the compliance of the other, but Edelgard was certain, from all evidence provided, that such an action would only ensure she had an enemy for life where she could have made an ally. And she would much rather have the Eisners on her side than any of Those Who Slither in the Dark.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks! Anyways, I was going to have a small little party later with Dedue since it's his birthday. Did you want to come along?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I would hate to intrude, but do send along my well wishes." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure thing, take care!" Shez said with a grin before she walked away, feeling thankful that her sister had some nice students in her class. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Slamming her fist onto the table in front of her, Bias glared at nothing as she tried to figure out just </span>
  <em>
    <span>what the hell was happening. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It doesn't make sense! If Shez hadn't been the one to kill Pittacus, then who was? There was no way it could have just been an accident! For all his many, </span>
  <em>
    <span>many</span>
  </em>
  <span> flaws, Thales wasn't the type to die in a mere accident, and even if Pittacus wasn't as strong, she should have been smart enough to escape an attack. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, even if Shez was innocent, and Bias certainly disliked admitting that possibility, that didn't mean she was completely without use. For an Agarthan to show up here, with no notice from Myson, meant it was clear where her loyalty lay. If Cleobulus had indeed gone rogue, then they needed to find out what she was planning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the one hand, the fact that Shez had made contact with Kronya was a showing that she was willing to work with them. On the other hand, she was actively avoiding Solon, something she would only do if she did know who he was disguised as. Something most rank and file wouldn't know, while Cleobulus would. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was also the possibility of Myson getting too big for his britches and sending someone without informing them. Regardless, the only way to know for sure was to extract the info from Shez directly. Now, how would they do that…?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see time has done little for that anger of yours," Solon commented as he entered the backroom, looking down at the cracked table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Forgive me for trying to figure out what a potential traitor might be planning," Bias shot back, "When was the last time we had any word from Cleobulus?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What she is doing is of no matter, you foolish child," Solon scolded, "Even if she has gone rogue, she is still working to erode the kingdom. And even if she plots against us, she cannot hope to face us with the forces of that pathetic nation. There was a reason Thales chose to usurp the empire as the force we would use against these vile beasts."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah yes, of course, the empire we barely have a hold on anymore.” Bia scowled, her eyes narrowed as she tried to think. “...Could the hegemon be lying to us? If that brat Shez actually was–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cease your prattle,” Solon ordered and Bias felt herself stiffen at the command. For a moment, she felt like a mere apprentice again, laboring under her mentor’s critical eye. “There is no value in investigating a matter long settled. Thales is dead, and we must move on for the sake of freeing the world from the abominations that seek to rule us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In that case, interrogating Shez is our best option, so we may learn what she is planning! Even if Cleobulus can’t defeat us directly, she is a thorn we cannot ignore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bah, fine. If you wish to frolic among the beasts, go ahead. The ‘lions’ are hosting a party of some type in the dining hall. If you’re so desperate to learn, then make your excuses to be there and be off.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias grimaced, but nodded to her mentor. She was used to harsh words from the elder sage. He was always like this, thinking himself better than everyone all while he called himself the Saviour of Agartha…it was almost enough to drive a woman mad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Keeping her thoughts to herself, Bias began to walk away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Easily shifting back to the facade of the ever pleasant nun, Selene gently smiled at any who looked her way. A part of her idly wondered if she should just blow her cover so she wouldn't need to hide here anymore. It was disgusting having to pretend to be a nun for that horrid beast that pushed her people underground. Perhaps, once this was all over, she would be allowed to be part of the team that destroyed the monastery. If nothing else, seeing the Cathedral burn down would bring her great pleasure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, the Agarthan arrived at the dining hall to find the Lions were indeed all there, apparently celebrating the beast from Duscur for some reason. There seemed to be two groups in particular, with the prince, two of the females, and the gray-haired rat gathered about the massive beast while ‘Shez’ was in a separate gathering with a few of the ‘noble’ heirs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Frowning, Selene began to move closer to hear what they were saying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t believe the time for summer uniforms came and went while I was dealing with my piece of crap brother,” the Gautier beast complained, “Why is the goddess so cruel to those that deserve it the least?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Alright what are you complaining about now?" asked the Galatea, completely confused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Apparently Professor Byleth wore a summer uniform while we were gone and Lorenz, of all people, made sure to let me know how much of a shame it was that I missed it. Apparently that coat of hers seriously hides how great the professor’s hips look." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...So I didn't know you were friends with Lorenz," Shez commented, trying to pivot the conversation away from the topic of her sister’s figure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, not really. We just had a few friendly competitions here and there." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh? What kind?" Shez asked, her interest piqued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of the flirting variety." Ah yes, Selene was well aware of Gautier’s attempts at 'flirting'. One would think being a nun would mean she would be free from such advances. They would be sorely mistaken.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...With each other?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? No. If I was flirting with a dude, he’d have to be way prettier than Lorenz.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you ever actually listen to yourself speak?” Fraldarius asked, already looking done with this conversation despite contributing to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I prefer listening to ladies talking." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then stop talking already," the swordsman snarked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't think Sylvain could survive if he couldn't talk," Shez commented, “It’s basically breathing for him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, come on now, I can keep quiet! I’m great at staying quiet!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then prove it,” Fraldarius ordered, scowling as he did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nah I don't feel like it," Gautier responded, getting Shez to laugh as his two fellow lions let out a pair of sighs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Bias, meanwhile, could only question how these people happened to be the ones who got to live in the sun. The False Goddess these beasts worshipped was truly a cruel thing to favor such wretched–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you want to join?" Turning around with a start, Bias found the dull-eyed beast standing behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It looked like you were interested in the party," the professor explained, glancing over her shoulder towards the chattering vermin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, well, no, I was just curious, that's all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay. Feel free to join if you want to," the dullard said with a nod, before walking past her to join in. With a barely disguised scowl, Bias watched the newly minted professor greet the students and her sister. The two seemed close, and that sent an unpleasant pang through the sage’s chest. For a brief moment, she wondered if killing one would make the other come after her in revenge. A part of her wanted to, if just to share the pain around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No matter. She would just have to deal with both if it came down to it. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Mmf, woo, might have overdone it today,” Shez mumbled to herself as she walked along the darkened halls of the monastery, dimly lit by lantern light in the evening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, with Arval, she was never just mumbling to herself. “My word, could it be? The bottomless pit you call a belly has actually been filled? Quick, alert the Knights! A harbinger of the end times has made itself known!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uuuugh, shut it, Arval. It’s not just the food, it’s the sweets. Didn’t expect Mercedes to get that into baking for Dedue. I swear, she must’ve been trying to show off with all those cakes…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was impressive, admittedly. A shame I can’t taste such pastries, though I suppose I can derive some satisfaction from your own enjoyment, my gluttonous partner.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If I’m a glutton, what’s that make By?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…a gourmand? Though I wouldn’t call her a connoisseur by any means.” They huffed, faintly amused. “I don’t think there’s even an item on the menu that sister of yours dislikes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, she’s never been picky…hm. Hey, Arval, where are we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Partner. Are you telling me you were walking without a destination in mind?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I was heading back to my dorm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Your dorm is on the first floor. We are on a second floor. Do you see where there may be an issue in your thinking?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh…Well, huh. To be fair to me, this place is really easy to get lost in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I thought I heard a voice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, duh, I’ve been speaking–” That wasn’t Arval’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then turned around in some surprise to see that weird librarian guy. “Oh, hey…you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello yourself, young lady. Are you lost?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, not really. I’m just taking a walk to settle my stomach,” Shez lied, “I ate too much at dinner, you know how it is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hahaha, yes, I’m quite aware of how youth tends to lead to overestimation of one’s abilities. Or, in this case, capacity for consumption. Ah, but I digress. I’ve been hoping to talk to you for a time, young Miss Eisner, but you never come by the library unless by accident.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, y’know. I’m busy with student stuff,” she lied again. She wasn’t sure what it was about this guy, but something about him just felt off to her. It was a weird feeling too, like he was familiar but not.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still, I was hoping to speak to you, and I am quite glad I have finally cornered you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval frowned. “I don’t like that word he just used. ‘Cornered’ is an unpleasant turn of phrase for a mere conversation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, you found me. So what’s up?” Shez asked while wondering if she would have to fight an old man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your mother’s name was Periander, was it not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, completely caught off guard. “Ah–Hold on, what? You knew my mom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not directly. I was aware of her, as I was aware of many individuals of interest operating within our community. You see, your mother actually stole something very important from us." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...She did?" Shez asked, taking a step back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, it was something of an experiment you see, meant to grant someone the power of a God. However, for some reason, your mother decided to steal it and ran away." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry to say, I don't know what you're talking about. Mom didn't tell me much about her past." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so? Have you not wondered about that ability of yours? That mysterious blade you seem capable of summoning seems quite powerful, doesn't it? Far stronger than any other you've seen, I imagine." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, thanks for the compliment, but nah, not interested in finding out," Shez said, taking another step back, debating whether she should try jumping out the window or risk one of the students' rooms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? I myself find it quite intriguing. And I suppose if you don’t, then that just means you're a failed experiment, does it not?" Tomas said, bringing his hand up as he formed a sigil. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez had only a moment to jump back, trying to create some distance between her and the librarian, before she felt herself falling over as everything turned dark. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The last thing she heard before everything went black was Arval shouting in panic, and the yowling of a cat. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>"Hello again, Professor Byleth. It’s always a pleasure to see you at the beginning of a new month," Rhea said with a smile on her face, “I hope classes have been going well for you now that you’re back to teaching.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth gave a polite smile in return. "Yeah, it feels nice being able to teach again, especially with so many new students." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let's hope it is not too hectic for you. For now though, we must speak about this month’s mission-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Rhe–Lady Archbishop!" Seteth yelled, panic evident in his voice as he ran into the audience chambers. "Flayn is missing!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Seteth, please calm down,” Rhea requested, “Tell me what happened." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, have you seen her anywhere!?" Seteth asked, clearly unable to calm down as he focused on Byleth instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, do you want me to help look for her?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please, she might be in danger!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, perhaps you would allow me to discuss things with Seteth first?" Rhea asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, if she's missing we should look for her right away,” Byleth stated, “I can get my students to help out if need be." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...you're right, time is of the essence. Seteth, inform the other professors. Professor Byleth, please tell your own class as well. We'll have the knights search the town, so the students shall scour the monastery." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Very well." Bowing to Rhea, Byleth glanced at Seteth. "I'll make sure to find her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you, Professor." </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Flayn has gone missing?" Edelgard asked, trying to keep a sign of shock in her voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, we'll be searching for any sign of her,” Byleth explained, “If you find anything then you're to immediately inform me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course! We will scour the entire monastery for her at once!” Ferdinand declared, practically volunteering to lead the charge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, I imagine the knights have already started searching the Abyss, but Hapi and I shall meet up with Yuri to see if he has heard of anything!" Constance said, also already making plans, which earned her a side eye from Hapi.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…I heard Flayn has a major crest. Perhaps she was kidnapped because of it?" Linhardt guessed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are we sure she got kidnapped? For all we know she just ran away,” Emily muttered, prompting a frown from Dorothea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is now really the time to suggest a girl like Flayn might have eloped?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did I say anything about eloping? Who would even want her like that? She’s tiny.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re shorter than Edie.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Any guesses we make now will be purely conjecture. What we need to do is get information first," Hubert interrupted, his own tone even and firm as the noble and commoner glared at one another. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, we need to get out there right away!" Caspar decided, ready to take up the charge!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh no, I hope nothing bad happened to her…" Bernadetta mumbled, not at all willing to take up any charge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I pray the goddess is protecting Flayn," Marianne murmured, clasping her hands in a hopeful prayer instead of participating in any sort of charge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"For now, we should spread out. Make sure to be careful everyone." Nodding, Byleth dismissed her class before they all went out to look for Flayn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, if I may." Turning, Byleth noticed Edelgard and Hubert approaching her. "I wanted to discuss what we were going to do. If we are to search for Flayn, then we must work on the assumption she did get kidnapped, and didn't just run away." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, Flayn wouldn't run away,” Byleth agreed, “Seteth may be overbearing but they do care for one another." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Glad we are in agreement,” Edelgard said, thinking up her next words carefully. While she had no love for Rhea’s kind, if Those Who Slither were able to successfully take Flayn away, then it would cause too many problems down the line. So while she did agree to letting Jeritza kidnap her, there were no stipulations she couldn't foil their plans. "For now, let's try to see who would benefit the most from kidnapping her. It likely isn't someone looking to make a profit since they left no message of any sort, so their goal must be beyond a monetary reward."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can also assume she’s alive. There would be no point in abducting her if simple murder was the objective,” Hubert chimed in. “It’s only logical.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, I’ll keep that in mind. You make sure to be careful, they might not stop at just Flayn,” Byleth said, nodding to them before going off, leaving the two alone in the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How much time do you think we have, Lady Edelgard?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A few days at most. They’ve probably already extracted her blood, but whatever they might be planning will take more resources than whatever they have at the monastery here,” Edelgard guessed, “We should still be careful not to let them know we’re working against their plans.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I doubt Emily will be smart enough to notice, and Bias seems far more interested in Shez. Given that said girl might also be working against them, that only leaves Solon.” Yes, the final Slitherer in the academy. Perhaps if she had stayed in contact with them she would know who he was disguised as, but as it stood, all she knew was that he was a member of the staff. Though that was enough for her to warn Monica never to be alone with any member of the staff when she went to the academy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For now, just attempt to look busy with the search, and try to point the professor to Jeritza if she finds no leads.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very well, Lady Edelgard.” </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Trying to find someone missing was quite the challenge for Byleth. Rescuing people was never her forte as a mercenary, especially since Shez could travel much faster than her and warp away with the people she found, so all she could really do was walk around the monastery and investigate as best she could, which mostly involved asking people what they knew. Though that led to its own problems, she kept getting pointed towards different people: Alois, Gilbert, and even Shamir were pointed to as suspicious individuals. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not that they had anything to do with it. Sure, she might not know Gilbert or Shamir that well, but the former had only just returned from assisting in the Kingdom, while the latter had Catherine vouching for her. And while she might still have her issues with Catherine, Byleth could at least be sure of her loyalty, if nothing else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, it really is odd, there’s been no demand for a ransom, and the perpetrator was able to grab her without anyone noticing. Maybe it was someone she knew?” Claude guessed as Byleth was asking around for more info. “She might have gone along willingly if it was someone she trusted.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But Flayn doesn’t really know anyone that well. At least not enough to follow someone out of the monastery without telling anyone.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Claude!” Looking over, the two saw Ingrid and Sylvain approaching. “Have you seen Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not today, why do you ask?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean you haven’t seen her? Didn’t she transfer over to your class?” Sylvain asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“First I’ve heard about this. She certainly wasn’t in my class when Manuela told us the news about Flayn.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth felt strange. Like there was a pit opening in her stomach. “...When was the last time you two saw her?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, back at the party last night? She went off to her dorm afterwards. We haven’t seen her since.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You don’t think Shez might have–” Whatever Claude was about to say, Byleth didn’t hear as she ran off, immediately going to Shez’s room hoping to find her sister had just overslept.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait for us!” It seemed the three students were worried too since they followed behind her, but she wasn’t focused on that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And while Byleth had felt fear before, it hadn’t prepared her for the sudden panic that hit when she saw her sister’s bed was empty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No no no no,” she murmured, before moving into the room and throwing the covers off the bed, as though that would help. “Shez? SHEZ!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, professor–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, hold on, just–” Where had she last seen her? She left after dinner, they said good night, Byleth had gone out to visit her mother’s grave–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, you need to calm down–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m calm. I am completely calm. I need to find my sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Teach, your hands are on fire.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused, then shook her hands, dispelling the burning magic that had been gathering there. “I’m fine, I’m calm–When did you all last see her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sylvain and Ingrid exchanged glances before the redhead spoke, “Like I said, we saw her yesterday at the party. I know she went off when she wanted to get some rest, but we didn’t see her after that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What were you doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He blinked, but Ingrid answered for him. “After the party, we were talking about our childhood. About…expectations and how bad things could be. It was something we should have gotten to before, but…regardless, I said good night to Sylvain at…ah, I’m not sure what time exactly, but it was in the evening.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, professor, you don’t actually suspect us, right?” Sylvain asked, making Byleth pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No. I don’t think so. It wouldn’t make sense, she likes you two.” But that would make it easier if they wanted to hurt her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Teach.” Claude caught her attention next, placing his hand on her shoulder. “We’ll find her. Try to avoid getting paranoid, okay? Trust me, it does more harm than help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Right. Okay. Sorry.” Byleth felt itchy. LIke she needed to move. “I need to ask around. I need to…I need to find her, now. Her and Flayn.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, and we’ll all help with that. You don’t need to worry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But she was worried. She was more worried than she’d ever been in her life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So to the shock of most of the monastery, Byleth ran as quickly as she could through the grounds, getting a couple of startled cries from students who had to jump out of the way to not get run over by her. Jeralt in particular nearly jumped out of his chair as Byleth crashed through the door to his office. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah, kid, what’s the rush-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Have you seen Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? No, I haven’t. What happened? Did she take something of yours?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When was the last time you saw her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When she went on the mission to Conand Tower. Byleth, what’s going-...” Jeralt trailed off as he saw the look in her eyes. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No one’s seen her. She wasn’t in her room and she wasn’t in the Golden Deer or Blue Lions class.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay Byleth, try to stay calm. Shez is strong, she’s probably not in danger.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then why hasn’t she just warped back!?” Byleth shouted, before feeling Jeralt’s hands on her shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s going to be okay. We’ll find her. And if anyone has hurt her, we’ll make them pay.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he said this, Byleth noticed how his hands were shaking as he held her, as if holding back his own anger. Gritting her teeth, Byleth swore to herself that she wasn’t going to let anything happen to her sister.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Shez</span>
  </em>
  <span> has gone missing?” Edelgard asked without having to feign shock this time. She genuinely was surprised, though…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, she has. The same things as before still apply, search the grounds, interrogate the staff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe ‘interrogating’ the staff was part of your instructions last time,” Hubert pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t, but now it is,” Byleth insisted, “I realize I’m acting differently now that it’s my own sister in danger. I feel bad about it and I’ll apologize to Seteth later, but I’m still searching for Flayn, I just need to find Shez too. I think it has to be connected, which means either the same person grabbed both of them or there’s a larger group in play.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard knew there was a large group in play, which was why her suspicions were raised. She knew Jeritza was the one to abduct Flayn, Bias had informed her of that ahead of time, but…Hm. Had Shez actually been working with them all this time? Or maybe Bias hadn't believed her lie… Still, why would she be so obsessed with Shez…?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Had Shez assassinated Thales? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just, please, inform me if you hear anything,” Byleth requested, before she outright sprinted off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My, she can certainly move quickly when she wants to,” Hubert noted, before glancing at Edelgard again, “Your highness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m just considering matters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“May I ask what thoughts you have?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…I’m not sure what I’m thinking yet.” A part of her was considering just how deep in the plots of Those Who Slither in the Dark Shez could actually be, whether the girl was more involved in the abduction of Flayn than Edelgard realized, or if her suspicions were completely unfounded and Shez really was as ridiculous as she acted. Though, in fairness, Kronya’s existence proved that the Agarthan infiltrators could be genuinely stupid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Another part though was more focused on the distress her professor was experiencing. The obvious anxiety in every movement as she practically sprinted across the monastery grounds, speaking to as many people as she could to piece together what their movements were. It was…surprisingly upsetting to see her normally unflappable professor genuinely upset. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This wasn’t a moment of vulnerability that Byleth was sharing with her. It was genuine panic for the sake of her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And that panic continued as the first day of their search came to a close without any success. Neither Flayn nor Shez had been found, and Edelgard couldn’t help but notice some newer faces poking around the monastery as she headed to class the next day. It seemed Captain Jeralt was taking the situation seriously enough to call in his mercenaries to start investigating.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, if need be, you could suspend classes again,” Ferdinand suggested as their professor arrived, her hair messier than usual and bags visible under her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s a good point. Right, I should have done that. I think…did everyone do that? I’m going to talk to the other professors, bye.” And she promptly left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...U-Uh, so, wait, are we allowed to leave?” Bernadetta asked, confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“M-Maybe we should get back to searching?” Marianne suggested. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would anyone care to assist Hapi and I in Abyss?” Constance offered, “Yuri and the knights have been scouring it, but I imagine they would appreciate more eyes down there.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll go down with you. Haven’t had much luck up here, so might as well go down there.” Dorothea said, volunteering as Caspar got up too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll come with you! If there’s any baddies that need taking down, I’m with you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, it’s appreciated, Caspie. Just try not to go after any of the Abyss folk by mistake, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I wonder, just what sort of connection does Shez and Flayn have?” Linhardt muttered as he tried to figure out what was going on there. “They’re not related, and only one has a crest. There were no demands either, so it wasn’t because of Seteth’s or Jeralt’s position…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There is no time to be wasting! The sooner we move, the sooner we save them from being childnapped!” At Petra's words, the class got up, filing out as they began their search once more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Emily, a word,” Edelgard said, getting the girl to stop, who was looking more surly than usual.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” She scowled as she faced them. “If this is about Shez, I don’t know anything.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They don’t tell me anything, so for once we’re in the same position. For all I know, she’s the one who grabbed Flayn.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Somehow I doubt that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If that’s all, then I’m going,” Emily grunted, marching out without another word. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…seems we have to keep going for a bit longer,” Hubert mused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Should we investigate the staff quarters today?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know what you’re thinking Lady Edelgard, but we must not give Those Who Slither in the Dark reason to believe we’ve betrayed them. Not to mention there is still the possibility that Shez is working with them.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Staying quiet, Edelgard's mind drifted to the look on her professor’s face as she walked in this morning. The chances that Shez were working with Those Who Slither were almost nil. She was too open, too idiotic, too attached to her sister. But…Kronya believed she was Agarthan. And there was evidence to point to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The possibility was greater than zero, and that meant it was too high to throw caution to the wind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It may not end well, but for the sake of the future you wish to create, sacrifices must be made.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re right. For the sake of a better Fodlan.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second day of investigation went about the same, with no one able to find anything. Byleth nearly ran herself ragged as she ran to and fro, the only ones matching her fervor being Seteth and Jeralt, as the latter had his mercenaries investigate every inch of the town they could. Some suspicions were raised about Jeritza, but by the time they were, the sun had already set, meaning it was far too late in the day to properly investigate him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Retiring for the night, Edelgard began to wonder whether she should risk telling Byleth the next day or not. Such thoughts plagued her as she went to sleep, and with the thought of Byleth worrying about her own sibling, it was only to be expected that her nightmares visited her once again. Memories of her siblings crying out for help, of her father being unable to save her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of herself, being too weak to do anything for them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Edel…delga…Edelgard?” Shooting awake as someone began to knock on her door, Edelgard gasped for breath as she was freed from her nightmares. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-Who’s there?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s me, Byleth. Are you okay?” came the tired voice of her professor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...G-Give me a moment,” Edelgard responded, getting up to get dressed, lest she open the door in her nightwear. Moments later, she opened the door, and found her professor standing there, looking even more exhausted than earlier. “Professor? Why are you still awake?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was still looking for clues when I heard noises coming from your room. Is everything okay?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Just some nightmares, nothing I am not used to. Should you not try to get some rest?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m okay. I took a nap earlier. And besides, I found something.” Lifting her hand up, Byleth showed off a flower styled hairclip. “This belongs to Shez, I actually found it outside your room, she must have been up here when they grabbed her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She was?” Edelgard asked, shocked once again. Had it happened in the middle of the night? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think so, she’s always had it since I gave it to her, so it must have fallen off,” Byleth said, holding onto the hairclip gently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I understand, professor, but perhaps you should rest for now. If we were to find Shez tomorrow, you won’t be any help if you’re too tired.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I can’t stop, Shez might be in danger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, please, you need to get some sleep. I can assure you that as soon as you wake up, we’ll resume the search once again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“..” Byleth seemed to want to argue for a moment, before she stopped, letting Edelgard grab her by the hand to lead her back to her room. “...Huh. Just remembered something.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know how you asked about my travels? I remembered something that happened in the Oghma Mountains. Shez and I were practicing magic, it was the first time I cast light magic, and it was a big one,” Byleth said, a fond smile on her face. “Shez was really impressed, especially since it caused a rockslide.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, don’t worry, Ezra said it was okay, there weren’t any villages on that side apparently,” Byleth explained, a bit delirious as the exhaustion hit her. “Did spook dad though, went to the kingdom afterwards.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...It was an accident?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm? Ah, yeah. I tried the…the light spell, the big one. One of the big ones, I think.” Byleth yawned, not noticing the look on Edelgard’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see…We should get you to bed, professor. We can discuss more ideas in the morning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm…alright. Just…we need to be fast. Need to make sure Shez is safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll do that, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard led her professor to her bedroom, then saw her off for the night, only closing the door once she had seen Byleth flop onto the bed and fall straight asleep. Then she returned to her own room, shut the door, and placed both hands over her mouth as she crouched down and tried to stifle the hysterical laughter that threatened to bubble up out of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Knowing that monster Thales really had died in a complete accident, had been killed by a teenage girl showing off to her little sister–It was almost, </span>
  <em>
    <span>almost</span>
  </em>
  <span> enough to make her think there really was such a thing as divine justice. There wasn’t, she knew that, and that actually made it better because the rotten bastard had died because of random chance! No grand final battle for him, just crushed under a landslide, squashed like a bug with a rock!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For the first time in a long time, Edelgard’s composure broke, and she just laughed and laughed at the thought of the worst monster she had ever known dying so pathetically.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked, slowly, waking up in her bed and wondering how she…No, she knew how she got there. She should thank Edelgard later…when she wasn’t so tired.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let out a slow yawn as she sat up. She was still wearing everything from yesterday, which was kind of annoying. It wasn’t the first time she’d fallen asleep in her clothes, but she’d gotten out of that habit now that she had a specific room to rest in…And her brain was still focused on inconsequential things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your student was right. You needed the rest,” Sothis commented as Byleth pushed herself up from the bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know. It still bothers me. I should be searching for Shez. Flayn too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re of no use to anyone if you drive yourself to exhaustion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Byleth repeated, some annoyance flaring up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re aware, but I don’t think you accept it. At least you’ve been eating, but you really should be taking further care of yourself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can do that when Shez is safe.” She stretched, grunting at the sensation of her tense muscles straining until her back popped, prompting a brief sigh. She glanced at the sleeves of her coat and gave the front of her shirt a tug. “...Clean enough.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sothis sighed, watching as her host ignored her own hygiene in favor of heading for the door, though she blinked when she noticed who happened to be waiting outside. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Edelgard?” Byleth blinked. “Ah, did you need something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, I might have an idea,” Edelgard said, her voice firm and her gaze steady, “Call it a hunch, but I think I might know who abducted your sister.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>Shez felt a dull pain aching throughout her body as she stirred awake. She blinked, slowly, trying to spot something in the dark room around her before she tried to get up. The cold feeling of steel binding her arms to her torso soon let her realize that wasn't going to be an option. The chain around her kept her bound to the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-Where am I?" she asked, looking around, before spotting someone else with her. "F-Flayn?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The only response she seemed to get was the light rising and falling of the green-haired girl’s chest, telling her she was still breathing. Struggling in her chains, Shez tried to crawl over to her, before some tapping on the floor told her someone was approaching them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It’s about time you woke up." Looking over, Shez found Tomas the librarian staring down at her. All at once, the memories of last night hit her and Shez scowled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You dirty dastard, let us go!" Shez shouted up at him, before trying to use her awakened form, only to stop as Tomas raised a hand and a large sigil formed under Flayn. A moment later, several dark spikes manifested around Flayn, pointing straight at the unconscious girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do not attempt anything. She is more useful to me alive, yet she is still useful dead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–Let her go!” Shez shouted, even as she stilled her movements.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. To think one who wields the power of Epimenides would want mercy for one of these abominations…Truly such a disgrace.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are you talking about?" Shez questioned, glaring up at the old librarian. "What the hell is an Epi-knees?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…did your 'mother' truly not tell you anything? Such a shame. You'll end up dying without knowing a thing. You truly are a failure." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey, that's not funny, let go of me already!" Shez shouted, struggling again in her chains. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please don't tell me you're falling for this, Tomas," spoke a new voice, getting Shez to look over and see someone in black robes and a red bird mask approaching her. Crouching down next to Shez, she grabbed her face with one hand to make her look up at the mask. "What is Cleobulus planning?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Who the hell is that?" Shez asked, unsure of what she was being asked–Then her head snapped to the side as she received a harsh backhand in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't pretend. Tell me what Cleobulus is planning and I'll make your death quick." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't know who that is, asshole!" Even through the mask, Shez could tell whoever this was was scowling at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You expect me to believe that!?" she suddenly yelled, her grip tightening on Shez’s face. "Why did you–Ah!" Yanking her hand back, Bias scowled down Shez, who defiantly glared back at her after biting down on her finger. "So you don't want an easy death…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A dark energy began to gather in her hands, only to get interrupted as a different masked mage rushed into the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Lady Bias, Lord Solon, they found us! The Death Knight is on his way and it's only a matter of time until the beasts chase after him!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Tch, that Knight truly is useless. We were better off not recruiting him." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No point in whining. It's sooner than we hoped, but just buy us time until we're ready to leave,” Solon ordered, making Bias pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? No, I’m not done here! She needs to tell me–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This ignorant child doesn’t know anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bullshit she doesn’t! Even if she wasn't there–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does it matter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias blinked behind her mask, then stared at her fellow sage in blatant confusion. “Of course it does! If Cleobulus killed–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, she didn’t. From my own investigation, a sudden landslide is what caused the initial incident. Perhaps it was caused by external means, or perhaps it was simply ill luck, but neither option truly matters. What matters is that they are dead, and we have what we need before us." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–You can’t be serious!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Be silent, Bias.” The old man glanced at the door. “We’re not alone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The door opened again, letting Shez see an armored knight wielding a massive scythe walk right in, his skull-faced helmet showing a pair of glowing eyes as he regarded the pair of mages. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"YOU ARE STILL HERE. WHY?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That doesn't matter,” Bias replied, audibly annoyed, “Just get to work defending this location until we can leave." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"VERY WELL. THEN THAT IS TWO OF THE MISSIONS I OWE.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? What the hell are you talking about?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"KIDNAPPING THE GIRL WAS THE FIRST MISSION, THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT OF DEFENDING YOU, OR OF HER BEING INVOLVED," The Death Knight stated, gesturing to Shez, “THEREFORE THIS IS THE SECOND OF THE MISSIONS I OWE.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You don't get to twist-!" Whatever Bias was about to say was cut off as the Death Knight placed his scythe against her neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"DO NOT ANGER ME. IT IS MY MASTER'S COMMAND THAT I AM SERVING YOU FOR NOW, BUT THE MOMENT THE PACT ENDS, I AM FREE TO DO WHAT I WISH." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. Quite the talent you acquired for our ends, Bias,” Solon commented, earning another glare from her. “Very well, hold them off then. We’ll want to leave the beast behind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“VERY WELL.” The knight turned away, uncaring of what his so-called allies wanted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Filth,” Bias cursed under her breath, before looking back at Solon, “We’re taking this brat then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps. I’m considering matters.” Solon regarded Shez with a curious eye, making the girl scowl back at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You try to take me with you and I swear, I’ll kill every last one of…whatever you’re supposed to be!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can’t seriously be trying to lie to us right now,” Bias growled, prompting a laugh from Solon. “What’s so funny?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You really are far too easily irritated. You always have been, ever since you were a child. Stubborn, willful, and easily angered. I really must say, I’m disappointed you haven’t realized that this girl really is as ignorant as she appears.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s…She can’t be! She’s working for Cleobulus!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A name she plainly does not recognize. Here, allow me to demonstrate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dark magic suddenly poured off of “Tomas” as his false guise melted away, revealing the true face of Solon. And Shez couldn’t look more shocked if she tried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...W-What? How did…That’s just like…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like your ‘awakened form’? Not quite, child. What you see before you is the true face of humanity.” He smirked, leaning on his staff as he crouched down. “Your ‘awakening’ represents a more…simple version of what we can do. Of what your people are capable of.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...My people?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The people of Agartha. The true people of this land you call ‘Fodlan’. Those who guide the cycle of this world.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...W-Wait, that…that can’t be right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know it is. As I stated, I knew your mother, girl. A traitor to our people who fled the responsibility she should have carried out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias blinked. “What? What do you mean by that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly as I said. Periander was a scientist who refused her orders in favor of ‘rescuing’ her so-called child and acting as a mere caretaker, rather than carry out the project she was assigned. Fitting then, that she died like a beast of some common sickness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stiffened, the insult cutting through her racing thoughts as she glared up at the old man in front of her. “Don’t you dare talk about my mom like that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I will talk of traitors however I wish to. But I digress.” He stood again, before glancing at Bias. “Do you see now? The girl is of more use to us at our side than dead for some mistaken vengeance. Particularly when, from all evidence, it is Thales’s own stupidity that killed both him and your sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Bias stared at him. “...What does that mean?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dark magic brought down the cliffside around the carriage. Thales knew of a spell to shake the very earth and bend it to his whim. It is only logical then to presume he had a hand in his own demise.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...How is that logical?! You think it’s more likely he killed himself than someone might have wanted him dead!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Simply put, yes. Again though, I do not particularly care for any ‘truth’. I seek what I always have, the salvation of this world from the abomination and its spawn. Thales’s death matters nothing to my cause, and Pittacus’s demise matters even less. So stop whining, apprentice, and perform your role properly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Bias glanced at Shez again, who glared straight back. “...It does matter–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it doesn’t. Thales had his place, but he–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I DON’T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THALES!” Bias screamed, “This is about Pittacus! I couldn’t give less of a shit if that bastard died a thousand deaths, but she was my sister! My </span>
  <em>
    <span>twin!</span>
  </em>
  <span> You can’t tell me that doesn’t matter!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t.” Solon’s voice was steady, calm, and cold, yet Bias looked as though he’d punched her in the gut. “You are being irrational, your mind clouded by meaningless emotion. If there is even a single thing of worth that you have learned from me, it should be the fact that nothing matters besides the vengeance of our people and the righting of the cycle. Purge this worthless sentimentality from your mind, apprentice, or you will inevitably meet a fate much the same as your sibling.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias stared at Solon, silent and still to the point that Shez almost felt bad for her, before she placed a hand on her chest and bowed her head. “Of course, mentor. My apologies.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Solon watched her leave, then regarded Shez again, who grimaced at his gaze. “Hm…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the hell do you want?” she growled back, before flinching as he suddenly reached down and cupped her chin, staring directly into her eyes. “G-Gh–L-Let go!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Solon simply studied her, before a faint, amused smirk crossed his face at what he saw in the depths of her eyes. “...Not a failure after all then. Very well, my predecessor. I bow to the wisdom of my elder.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing you need to care about, child. Sleep now. This is all merely a nightmare, and one you shall awaken from soon enough.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with a flash of darkness, she was out again.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Rushing through the darkened underground, Byleth slashed through another mage standing in front of her, her mind completely focused on finding Shez as an archer ahead of her had but a moment to pull out an arrow before a spear pierced him, nailing him to a wall before Jeralt took it back by ripping it straight through the dying man’s chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, so this is the might of the Blade Breaker and Ashen Dragon when they work together." Hubert mused, casting a miasma spell on an armored knight as they came around the corner. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, gotta say, still feeling jealous your class got her as your teacher," Claude said, shooting an arrow at the knight to finish him off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should have tried harder to recruit her then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, how was I supposed to know Edelgard was going to immediately pounce on her? I wanted to bide my time and not seem so eager." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is now really the time to be arguing about this!?” Lysithea complained while blasting another knight with her own bolt of darkness, “We’re trying to rescue my apprentice!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure sure, we can argue later," Claude allowed, firing another arrow. "Eesh, how many soldiers do these people have? Gonna run out of arrows." A flash of light caught his attention and he aimed at a teleport sigil, only to pause as he saw Dimitri appear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Where am I now?" the young prince asked, looking around in confusion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there Dimitri, bout time you Lions showed up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Claude, finally, I was getting tired of ending up in random locations," Dimitri said, stepping out and surveying the location. "It seems you've worked hard already, allow me to clean up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rushing forward, Dimitri stabbed through one of the remaining soldiers as the rest of the Blue Lions began to appear from the sigil. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you have things handled here, we're going on ahead!" Byleth called out to them, as she and Jeralt rushed forward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, I'm going with you!" Lysithea called out as she chased after them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, guess I can take it easy now." Claude said, idly holding the last arrow in his quiver. Glancing around, he realized something. "Hey, Dimitri, where's Edelgard?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She said she was going to keep informing everyone of what was happening. Though I wonder just who is left to tell..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so…" Thinking to himself, Claude could only wonder what the Imperial Heiress was up to. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Busting through the final doorway of the underground base, Byleth and Jeralt found themselves against the last of the soldiers, with two drawing their attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"IT SEEMS THE TIME OF OUR BATTLE HAS BEGUN." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just shut up and fight them already!" the mage in a red bird mask shouted, before immediately casting a spell she had been charging at the two. Bringing her sword up, Byleth slashed through the fireball, before the father and daughter pair charged at their enemies. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Where's my daughter you dastards!?" Jeralt shouted, cutting through the soldiers between him and the Death Knight as Byleth swung her sword, making Bias duck as it extended, the chain whip wrapping around a different mage before cutting him in half. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clashing scythe against spear, the Death Knight began to chuckle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"SO YOU ARE THE ASHEN DRAGON’S FATHER. GOOD, PERHAPS YOU SHALL BE EVEN BETTER PREY THAN SHE WAS!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt growled. “And you’re the dastard that tried to cut her down. Congratulations, you’re the first guy to ever piss me off this badly!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“GOOD! SHOW ME THAT RAGE!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As her father and the Death Knight clashed, Byleth raced in, focused and silent as she slashed at the red-masked mage. Bias felt a snarl come to her face as leapt back, shoving another lesser mage in her way as she gathered her magic and unleashed hell on the brat in front of her–Who caught the flames on her sword and let the blade become wreathed in them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha. Alright, no playing around then.” Bias flung her hands out as flames surged up her arms and wrapped around the walls and sealed off the entrance, bathing the room in a sudden fire that made her own men yelp and flinch back, trying to avoid the fires now licking up their robes. Not that it bothered Bias, who continued unleashing blast after blast of flame at Byleth as she continued trying to strike at the troublesome mage, only for the Death Knight to suddenly lunge in the way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“FACE ME!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Damn it, focus on one person at a time!” Jeralt snapped, before trying to spear the dastard, only to get forced back into a clash with him as the Death Knight turned his attention back Jeralt’s way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I CARE NOT WHO I FACE, ONLY THAT I HAVE BLOOD!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“L-Lady Bias, please cease your spell!” one of the dark mages requested, “We’re going to burn alive–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then he caught a blast of miasma to the chest and went crashing to the ground, prompting a curious glance from the sage. “Hm? Well, look at you. Impressive spellcasting for a child.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am not a child!” Lysithea snapped, casting a swarm at the obvious leader of the mages, only to blink in shock as Bias simply grabbed one of her subordinates and shoved him in front of the spell. “W-What?! Why would you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias didn’t answer, instead pushing the struggling mage away as the dark insects stung and bit at him, before launching a roaring fireball straight at Lysithea, only for Byleth to cut through it as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tch. You’re getting damn annoying with that sword of yours, beast.” Twin sigils formed over her hands as flames surged up from the floor, yet Byleth was undeterred, swinging her sword out and slicing across the room towards the sage, who simply kicked the severed head of one of her subordinates in the way, knocking the blade off course. Byleth drew her sword back, about to rush the sage, when another soldier in black tried to drive a lance into her side, drawing her attention away as more black-clad fighters tried to cut her down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“MAGE! CEASE WITH THE FLAMES!” The Death Knight shouted, aggravation clear in his voice as even he started to feel the heat. Perhaps even worse than the others because of his thick armor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing but complaints from everyone around me today,” Bias grumbled, before snapping her fingers, ceasing the burning flames and allowing more students to enter through the entrance she’d sealed off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“NOT THAT PART!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? You didn’t specify.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor!” Dimitri shouted as he entered, running over to aid Byleth in her fight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Captain!” Leonie also shouted, immediately moving to try to help Jeralt as the Death Knight backed up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“HM. FINE! IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW MANY OF YOU THERE ARE! ALL OF YOU ARE MERELY FOOD FOR THE–GH!” And then Claude’s arrow caught him straight in the chest, piercing through the plate and into his collarbone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Word to the wise, don’t monologue mid fight,” Claude commented, then paused. “Hm, that’s actually pretty hypocritical of me to say, now that I think about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“FOOLISH BOY. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO DRAW MY BLOOD! I CANNOT BE FELLED SO EASILY!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, which is why we were giving Lysithea time to charge up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The knight paused, his gaze immediately going to the young mage who was finishing up forming a set of dark magic sigils before casting the strongest spell she currently knew. And the Death Knight felt his eyes widen at the sight of a dozen dark spikes forming all around him before they all drove into his body at once. “GAH! H-Hhaah…D-DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS ENOUGH TO–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt didn’t wait for him to finish. He just raced in and drove his spear into the Death Knight’s chest, plunging as deep as he could go and driving the knight to the ground in a heavy crash. “That was for my daughters, you dastard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“G-GHhhhhhh…N-NO…N-NO, N-NOT YET, I-I STILL HAD-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then a white light settled over him and the knight’s dimming eyes burned an even brighter red as he surged up, punching Jeralt straight in the face and knocking the man back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Captain!” Leonie cried, before she grit her teeth and rushed in, trying to stab the knight too, only for a wall of flame to block her way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah ah~! As much as I dislike him, I have reason to keep that one alive,” Bias chided, before she jerked her head to the side, avoiding a javelin that had nearly gone through her eye. “Ah, and it looks like the peons are all dead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Indeed they were, and Byleth was glaring straight at her while Dimitri leveled his remaining spear at the witch. “Surrender, now!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, I give up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” He blinked. “I…what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I give up. You win. I can’t beat all of you children along with that dull-eyed beast and her withered husk of a father. So I surrender.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” the Death Knight growled, ripping the spear free from his guts while Jeralt glowered, rubbing his jaw.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you trying to pull here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Me? Why would I be trying to pull anything?” Bias asked, audibly amused, before glancing over to the side, “How nice of you to join us, your majesty.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bias.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The students and the Eisners all paused at the distorted voice that sounded out, before they all got their first look at the Flame Emperor as the masked individual strode over to the Death Knight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Leave, Death Knight. You have nothing more to do here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...MASTER, I CAN STILL FIGHT.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you can’t. Go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The knight straightened, then, to the students’ surprise, bowed his head to the masked figure before vanishing in a flash of magic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Such a kind ruler,” Bias mocked, prompting the Flame Emperor to turn their attention her way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could not say the same of you.” The masked individual turned to the students, the professor, and the captain, regarding each in turn with a strange gaze. “Captain Eisner. I must apologize. I did not realize my allies intended to steal your daughter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Allies, huh? That big dastard there called you ‘master’,” Jeralt noted, his gaze cold, “I think that makes you two more than </span>
  <em>
    <span>allies</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And even then, you sure as hell should pick better ‘allies’ if these are who you want to work with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“‘Want’ is a very strong word, Captain Eisner. And not the best one to use there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How cruel, Flame Emperor. And after we have given you so much.” A new voice drew everyone’s attention towards a familiar, elderly man that just about everyone in the group recognized on sight. “You’ll make an old man weep.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tomas!?” Dimitri exclaimed, his eyes widening as the elderly librarian smiled at their group. It was a kind, friendly smile that was completely at odds with the current situation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WHAT!? But–But you–!” Lysithea stammered, her eyes wide too as an uncomfortably familiar feeling began to creep along her back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seriously? The old guy was in on all this?” Leonie murmured, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello, your highness, Lady Ordelia, and mutt,” Tomas greeted, his friendly voice carrying an obvious undertone of mockery, “You all look shocked. Though I suppose few of you would expect to see me down here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I sure as hell didn’t,” Jeralt responded, his eyes narrowed, “Gotta say, I didn’t think the librarian of all people would be a traitor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Traitor implies I was ever on the church’s side to begin with. The correct word would be infiltrator. Or spy, if you wish to put it more simply.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well jeez, and here I thought those conversations we had were just some nice, friendly chit chat,” Claude commented, his eyes narrowed as he kept an arrow nocked, “I don’t appreciate being lied to, old-timer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The irony in your words is palpable, young man. I suppose it is a shame to put an end to our talks though. You were an entertaining conversationalist. Much like a dog excited to hear the words ‘play’ and ‘fetch’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, you’ve made your point, you’re a very scary old man,” Jeralt groused, glaring irritably, “Considering how you’re talking, should I assume you’re the dastard in charge here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You would be correct. I am also the man who abducted your daughter.” The man’s eyes flicked towards the Sword of the Creator as its blade bounced off the magical shield he had prepared, prompting him to regard Byleth with faint amusement. “How reckless. You could have hurt me there, you know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I intended to,” Byleth replied, the first words she’d spoken since entering the underground chambers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tomas…why are you doing this?” Dimitri asked, stepping forward, “How could you ally yourself with these…monsters?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have no cause to answer you, beast. Though I will make note of your deep ignorance of this situation.” A cruel smile crossed the elderly man’s face. “I am not </span>
  <em>
    <span>allied</span>
  </em>
  <span> with anyone here. They are allied with me.” He gestured to his left, towards the mage in the bird mask. “The sage you have found yourselves having so much trouble with is my apprentice, Bias. A skilled practitioner who I essentially raised myself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll make me blush,” Bias grunted, barely playing along, not that Tomas seemed anything but amused by her irritation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And of course, you’ve met the Flame Emperor. Our wayward agent who has gotten up to quite the trouble even without our aid. I do believe you dealt with that bandit they hired to kill you quite handily, and then of course there was the aid offered in that feeble lord’s rebellion and the treacherous church’s graverobbing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Flame Emperor clenched their fists as the students looked at them with clear alarm. “Do not speak for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You truly have gotten quite free spirited haven't you?" Tomas mused before he smirked. "Perhaps throwing you into a dungeon again would make you more willing to put the leash back on?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A burst of fire from the Flame Emperor put the students on guard, until it dissipated as they held back from attacking Tomas. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, it seems some of Thales’s teachings have managed to stick." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Enough of this crap! Where’s my daughter?" Jeralt demanded to know, tightly gripping his spear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Safe and secure, for now anyways." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What do you want with her?" Byleth asked, her eyes moving between the three to make sure no one attempted anything. Her frown deepened as she saw Bias quietly move to grab the javelin lodged into the wall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing, for now. She may have her uses, but there is little use I have for someone ignorant of her true heritage." For the briefest moment, the Flame Emperor went still. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What the hell are you talking about?" Jeralt asked, glaring at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…perhaps a demonstration is in order?" With his smirk growing, a purple light seemed to surround Tomas. "This guise has no more use, afterall."  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a brief moment, his gaze met another's, a singular 'Black Eagle' in the group. Emily stared back, not quite sure how to react, not really even sure what was happening, but palming a dagger as her superior allowed dark magic to wreathe his form.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With a bright flash, Tomas was gone, and in his place stood Solon, his dark eyes bright with malicious amusement as the Agarthan smirked at the shocked faces. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…somehow, this feels less dramatic despite the bigger crowd. No matter. Captain Jeralt, was it?" Out of the corner of his eye, Solon watched Emily stiffen, before she began to quietly move over to her target. He let his smile grow ever so slightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I will gladly hand your daughter over, but it's only right if you offer something in exchange, no?" he suggested with a smirk as Kronya stood behind Jeralt, knife ready to pierce his spine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you want my spear in your gut, sure." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You aren't the first to make such an offer, but I digress. At least I will get to enjoy the sight of your painful de–...d..d-maawhk–” Solon choked, blood spilling from his mouth as he coughed, before his eyes darted down to the javelin that had been rammed through his back and out his chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A knife fell to the floor with a faint clatter as Solon gasped, clutching at his bloodied chest, his eyes widened with pure shock. For a moment, he turned his head, staring at the Flame Emperor, only to register that she looked as shocked as he did. “W-W-Whah…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wrong way, mentor,” Bias said, before she let go of the javelin’s shaft.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Solon turned, and even Jeralt felt his stomach turn at the look of shock and betrayal on the old man’s face. “B…B-Bia-aa…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. So you weren’t lying earlier then. You didn’t kill Pittacus or Thales,” she noted, almost conversationally, at most faintly intrigued by his disbelief. “That’s a shame. It would’ve been more pleasant if I could wrap up this whole ‘vengeance’ thing more easily. Ah well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then she snapped her fingers, and the old man erupted in flames. He didn’t have a chance to scream, if he even could, before he was reduced to blackened ash. Even his bones burnt away, charred past the point of holding together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What…Why would you do that?!” Dimitri exclaimed, “He–He said he was your mentor! That he raised you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” Bias glanced towards the prince, her head tilting much like the bird her mask resembled. “Yes, that was all true. Really, simply calling him mentor puts it in such a low light. He was my father in every way that mattered.” She couldn’t help but grin at the boy’s growing horror. “And I hated his filthy guts. So you can imagine my elation right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re twisted. What kind of monster are you?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t you like to know? But, as my late mentor would say, I have no cause to tell you. Flame Emperor, do you require my aid in escaping?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I have no need for your aid,” the Flame Emperor answered. Even through the distortion in their voice, it was plain to hear they were disturbed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. If you insist. But I do still owe you one, remember? So we’ll talk soon.” She regarded the students again then gave them a jaunty wave. “Ta ta~!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she vanished, and a moment later, after a small glance towards Byleth, the Flame Emperor vanished as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tension stayed in the air as everyone stared at either where their enemies were previously standing, or at the pile of ash that was Solon. The clatter of a sword falling to the ground broke the silence as Byleth ran forward, going towards the end of the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They're here!" she shouted, once she found Shez and Flayn. Reaching down, Byleth began to pull on the chains, trying to unwrap them from her sister. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, allow me," Dimitri said as he came up, before grabbing onto the chains, and pulling with all his might, making them snap. Byleth briefly thanked him, then pulled the remaining chains off Shez, freeing her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Idly aware of the other students healing any injuries or checking on Flayn, Byleth looked directly at her sister. A faint bruise on her cheek was the only injury she seemed to have; otherwise, it seemed like she was just asleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on, let's get her out of here," Jeralt said, reaching down to lift Shez up. Silently nodding, Byleth followed behind them as all the students made their way out of the underground chambers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But, as she walked, something caught her eye. Kneeling down, Byleth grabbed something off the floor. A strange, curved knife, one like nothing she had seen before. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Keeping a steady pace, Edelgard made her way to the staff quarters after tossing her Flame Emperor armor, her mind racing at what had occurred. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had already assumed the Slitherers had started to descend into factionism, but she didn't think it was bad enough to see Bias betray her comrade–her mentor, who she claimed was like a father–in front of everyone like that. Even more so, confirmation that Shez </span>
  <em>
    <span>didn't even know she was one of them. </span>
  </em>
  <span>That changed her perspective on the girl entirely, and it meant something else as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard had been completely wrong. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was…harder to admit than she expected. She was preparing for a war, she knew she would be sending people to their death. In theory, she was fully ready for innocent deaths to be on her shoulders. In practice, however… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shuddered. She couldn’t forget the panic in Byleth’s eyes, the distress at seeing her sister was gone. Her innocent sister, who knew nothing of the people of Agartha, nor of the atrocities they were responsible for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a brief moment, she wondered if they would have even found her alive if she had told Bias the truth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Was Edelgard really willing to condemn someone to death simply because of their origin? No. No she was not. She was better than that. She had to be better than that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Self-recrimination could come later though. For now, she hurried to the knight’s quarters just in time to see Jeralt exiting with Shez in his arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, princess,” he greeted, nodding to her, “Excuse me, gotta get her to the infirmary.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, of course.” She stood aside, letting him pass as she noticed Seteth hurrying over with the knights in tow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Edelgard, where is Flayn!? I heard–” The chamberlain paused, his panic fading as Byleth exited with Flayn on her back. “FLAYN!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay. She’s okay,” Byleth reassured, shifting her weight as Flayn slowly blinked awake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mmh…ah, brother?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Flayn…y-yes, it’s me, I’m here,” Seteth said, moving close as Byleth let Flayn down. The chamberlain quickly began checking his sister over, helping her stand as the other students excited and the knights moved in, heading into the quarters and the underground chambers beyond.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Make sure to find everyone,” Byleth requested, “There were some type of teleportation sigils down there that scattered the students around. We don’t want anyone to get lost down there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, professor,” the knight replied, and then Byleth’s attention turned towards Edelgard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for getting everyone,” were the first words she said, and they sent a pang of guilt through the princess. Even if Edelgard hadn’t told Bias the truth, that she had even once been willing to abandon Shez to her fate…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...It was the least I could do. I am sorry I was not there to help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You helped. Calling in reinforcements is still helping and messengers are an important part to any force.” She paused. “Hm. I should get back to teaching soon, I can feel myself already planning out a lesson based around the importance of reinforcements and messaging on the battlefield…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard felt her lips turn up into a slight smile. She let it happen, because she might as well show some positivity here. “I think it would make for a good lesson, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then I’ll add that to the lesson plan then. Oh, and Edelgard, do you think we could have tea sometime soon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She paused, a flash of confusion hitting her. “Ah…well, if you insist, professor. Though, shouldn’t you be focused on taking care of your sister?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, I will. I just think we need to talk. Okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Of course, professor.” And there, the sinking feeling in her stomach returned as her mind raced, trying to think of why her professor would want to talk so soon after her sister’s abduction and if it could be that she’d already figured out–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then her professor patted her on the head. “Thanks. Take it easy today, okay? I’ll see you soon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Edelgard just stared as her professor moved past her, heading in the same direction Jeralt had gone. She watched Byleth leave, and felt her gaze still lingering after her long after she was out of sight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her heart was still racing by the time she returned to her room. She simply closed the door, went to her bed, and laid down while hugging one of her pillows to her chest, thinking back to the smile her professor had given her. And as Edelgard felt her face warm, she came to a deeply distressing realization.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was infatuated with her teacher.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...oh no.”</span>

  <span>“Well, the good news is that I can give Shez here a clean bill of health,” Manuela said, smiling at Jeralt and Byleth as the two visibly relaxed. Jeralt more obviously than Byleth, though it was clear the older Eisner sister was happy to hear her sister was fine. “Whatever magic that ‘Solon’ man used, it really did just put her to sleep and the bruising on her face isn’t too bad. It should fade quickly with just a simple healing spell or even go away naturally.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sweet, so I can leave now?” Shez asked, already sitting up in bed and prompting a huff from Manuela.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait until I’m done, please. If you’re going to be joining my class, you’ll need to learn at least a little patience.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mmf.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You said that was the ‘good news’,” Jeralt noted, “I take it that means there might be some bad news?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, though it’s something small. Mainly that I noticed Shez had a small mark near her wrist, as though something had punctured there,” Manuela continued, prompting a frown from Jeralt, “I’m not sure quite what it might be, but there’s a vein there that makes it relatively easy to draw blood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. So, what, you think these people wanted Shez’s blood?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps? I was planning to check Flayn to see if she had similar marks, but Seteth’s being stubborn there.” She sighed. “Honestly, that man is far too overprotective. I’m a medical professional, I’d have a better idea of any issues she might have and yet he hasn’t once allowed her to even receive a check-up here. It’s almost insulting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I can see how it could be. Then again, he did just nearly lose his sister, so being protective is understandable,” Jeralt noted, glancing over at Shez again, who still looked annoyed at having to be in bed. “Gotta say, as much as I appreciate the work you do, I think I could stand to be in here less often.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s understandable, though there was at least a month between visits here.” With a smile, she leaned forward. "Though, perhaps you would prefer to visit for more personal reasons?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Right, Professor, if you're gonna flirt with my dad can you at least let me leave first?" Shez asked, getting an amused huff from Manuela. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that your way of saying I have your permission to~?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As long as it isn't in front of me, sure. Doubt he’s gonna say yes, but if you really want to go for it–"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm standing right here you know," Jeralt sighed as he rubbed the back of his head. "Listen, I'm flattered, but a young lady like you can do better than an old piece of leather like me. You're better off finding someone closer to your age." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh my, it's certainly been some time since someone has called me young lady," Manuela said, a light pink dusting on her cheeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, come on By, let's go," Shez said, getting out of bed and grabbing her somewhat awkward-looking sister to drag her along. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, make sure to tell me if anything feels off!" Manuela called out, a bit annoyed at Shez leaving without getting the all clear from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure thing!” Shez called back, before letting out a huff, “Right, not gonna go back there unless I can help it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, you should take care of your health,” Byleth chided as she let her sister continue to drag her along.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do take care of my health! I just don’t like laying in bed all day!” She huffed. “I have no idea how you did that for a whole month.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t even a month and I’m not as impatient as you,” Byleth replied, electing not to mention that even she’d gotten a little stir crazy the longer she’d sat there, “...Hey, Shez, do you feel okay to talk about what–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, hey, there you are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sisters paused, looking over to see Cyril approaching them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Lady Rhea was hoping you could stop by, and since you're not busy you can go now," he answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, I guess?" Shez said, frowning a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is it something important?" Byleth asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cyril shrugged in response, "She just told me to get you,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Okay." Nodding, Byleth moved to follow her, with Shez walking behind him. Arriving at the audience chamber, they found Rhea and Seteth waiting for them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hello there, I'm glad to see you are well after what happened." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, thank you. Uh, how's Flayn?" Shez asked, awkwardly glancing at Seteth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She's doing well. Tired, but well nonetheless," Seteth responded, before his gaze turned to Byleth. "Professor, words alone will never be enough to express how thankful I am for you saving Flayn. I am in your debt." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, you don't need to be. If anything I should apologize," Byleth said, frowning as she shook her head. "When I learned Shez had been taken as well, my focus shifted almost entirely to saving her. I almost feel like I didn't take saving Flayn as seriously."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yes, I suppose I can understand that. Saving someone you know can be a different feeling than saving someone from your family. For that, I cannot fault you,” Seteth responded as his features seemed to soften for a moment. "Were I in your position, I would have felt the same, and regardless, you still managed to save her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, uh, why exactly did they try to take her?" Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That…I'd prefer not to go into the details, but the blood running through her veins is special. In the wrong hands it can be dangerous. I tried to keep it a secret, but if those seeking it have already appeared, then the only thing I can do is to leave the monastery and hide with her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Brother, wait!" Flayn called out, seemingly listening in from the doorway as she came in, still a bit pale from what happened. "I do not like what you are thinking! I don't want to go into hiding once more." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Flayn, please, you must understand why I’m making this decision! If we stay here we'll be targeted again!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And do you truly think they won't find us once again?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She's not wrong." Shez interjected. "I… don't exactly know what's going on with those guys, but if they found out your secret once, then I doubt they'll give up easily. Besides, leaving means you'll have to protect her by yourself, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She is not wrong, Brother. In fact, I think I have the perfect solution! If you are that worried, then would it not be best to make sure I stay near someone who has fended them off not once, but twice?" Flayn suggested with a ‘cunning’ smile. "Such as, perhaps joining Professor Byleth’s class?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'd be happy to have you in my class," Byleth said with no hesitation, making Flayn smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I must admit, that is a good point,” Seteth conceded, “Despite my initial trepidation, you've proven time and time again to be trustworthy. Can you promise me you'll keep her safe?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I look forward to class!" Flayn exclaimed, her smile getting all the brighter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Which you can do once you have properly rested. Seteth, why don't you help your sister return to her bed?" Rhea suggested. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, thank you Archbishop. Come along, Flayn." Walking over, Seteth took Flayn’s hand to guide her out. Glancing over her shoulder, Flayn waved goodbye to the two sisters before they left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now then, since we are alone, can you tell me what exactly happened?" Rhea asked, keeping her tone gentle. Even then, the atmosphere seemed immediately much more tense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Staying silent, Byleth glanced at Shez, not wanting to speak up without her being okay with it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Frowning, Shez tried to think of what to say. “Alright, uh…hm. I guess…from the top, I was walking to my room–Wait, should I start with that part? Or…no, yeah, alright, I was lost, specifically, because the monastery’s way too big and I wound up going upstairs–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez. Your room’s on the first floor.” Byleth gave her sister a skeptical look. “...Were you trying to visit someone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? No, I got lost, like I said.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That seems a little much, even for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I was distracted! Look, can we save the comments for later? I’m telling a story!” Shez huffed, before frowning. “Right, okay…I was lost and I met that librarian guy, Tomas, who was actually this old man…Solon! That’s right, that one guy called him ‘Lord Solon’, and the other lady there was Bias. He apparently wanted to speak with me, and had to 'corner' me cause I was avoiding him." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"May I ask why you were doing so?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's…weird to describe, when I was near there was this…uncomfortable feeling with him. So I avoided the library as much as I could, honestly the only reason I ever got books from there was cause someone else got them for me. Anyways, he apparently knew my mom." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He did?" Byleth cut in, surprised at that revelation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, she…he called her a traitor to her people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Her people?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Solon said they were…called the people of Agartha." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What?" Rhea felt her blood run cold at that. She hadn’t expected to hear that name, hadn’t ever thought it would come up again–And if Shez was one of them…Rhea closed her eyes, taking a moment to steady herself. She needed to be calm here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she opened them again, Shez looked nervous. “Uh…is that bad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was an inane question. That anyone could think the Agarthans were anything but a genuine evil–But, no. She had to remember, she was speaking to a child. One that Byleth favored, no less. So she had to remain calm, and hear her out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is…concerning,” Rhea elected to say, “I would like to hear more of what was said before speaking further on the subject though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…Like I said, there was Solon and Bias, along with that Death Knight guy. Though I'm starting to think that guy was a mercenary," Shez explained, before continuing at their confused looks. "He apparently was only supposed to do three missions for them, and trying to defend them was the second." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…I wonder. He seemed to be working for the one they called the Flame Emperor. It doesn't seem like that person is friendly with the 'Agarthans', but is working with them at least," Byleth guessed, though in Rhea’s eyes that mattered little. If this person was working with the Agarthans, then they needed to be put to death immediately. She would not tolerate another Nemesis.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let's leave assumptions aside for now. Is there anything more you can tell us?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…well, apparently I have the power of something called Epi-knees." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Epines?" Frowning, Rhea tried to search her memory to see if she could remember any Agarthans by that name. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I don't…exactly know what that means, but I was apparently a failure or something. So I guess whatever they were planning didn't work. The only other thing…that Bias lady apparently wanted revenge for her sister." Shez frowned at that. "I don't know what exactly happened, but two people got killed. I don't remember the first one's name, but her sister was named Pittacus. She…that Bias lady is a bitch but…If something like that happened to Byleth, I don't know if I could act differently." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A part of Rhea felt only contempt at the idea of sympathizing with any Agarthan, a part that also felt a surge of vindictive pleasure at the thought of those monsters suffering further, but she could not allow that part of herself to influence her decisions. She knew loss, she still felt it keenly, and she could understand Shez’s mentality. She was a child with no context of the atrocities those vicious heretics had committed, so it was no wonder she felt the stirrings of sympathy for someone who had a sibling as she did.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It didn’t change what the Agarthans were.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I understand. It does not change the fact she abducted you and sought to harm both you and several students and faculty members, child. Do not allow sympathy to cloud your judgment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, sorry. It’s just…I didn’t really know anything about where I come from. I still don’t, really,” Shez admitted, “That my mom was one of these people…it feels weird, you know? Especially since it sounds like she wanted to get away from them…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, Rhea could at least give Shez’s mother some credit in abandoning those monsters.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...May I ask about your mother?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…well her name was Periander and…she died before I met By and Dad. She…she was really nice, always made sure I was taken care of. We didn't really talk with anyone else in the village, but I felt happy with her. She passed away cause of an illness and we didn't have the money to pay for medicine. It's…kinda weird to think. She always said she found me in the woods one day, though I guess that was just a cover story.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez couldn't keep the sad frown off her face. "Mom… always did her best for me. So it's strange to think that she and I are related to them. Though…maybe they're not all bad?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Child, I understand that your judgment may be skewed because of your mother, but you should not believe such a thing so easily. If that were the case, then others would have abandoned them as well, no?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, that’s a good point. But…what were they even trying to do? They grabbed me for that Epi thing, and they wanted Flayn for her blood, I guess? But, why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid we cannot know the truth of our enemy’s purpose without further information,” Rhea replied with a patient smile. It was better she be sympathetic to the child. If she could bring one of the Agarthan people to her side…it was a strange thought, but the idea of redeeming one of their kind did appeal, in an odd way. With that thought in mind, she turned her gaze towards Byleth. “Perhaps you could enlighten us, professor? You fought these infiltrators directly, after all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth straightened, folding her arms behind her back as she settled in to give her report, beginning with how she had gathered the students and her father to quickly go after them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"After we fought the Death Knight and Bias, the Flame Emperor and Solon appeared. It seems the Flame Emperor had a hand in the bandit attack that led to Shez and I joining the academy, as well as Lonato’s rebellion and the raid on the tomb of Saint Seiros, though that is only if we are to believe Solon’s words," Byleth explained, she remembered what happened. "There was…a mention of the Flame Emperor apparently acting on their own, with Solon wishing to get them under his control…if I were to hazard a guess, they might have been like Shez, though one who was considered a 'success' to them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Wait, you think this guy’s like me?” Shez paused. “...Does that mean he’s my brother??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, no.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Think about it though! Oh goddess, I have an evil brother…I wonder if he’s my twin?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea didn’t know what to say to that. “...” She really didn’t know what to say to that. So she just turned to Byleth. “What else do you recall?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, don’t ignore me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was after that point that Bias elected to quite literally stab her apparent mentor and father figure in the back with a javelin,” Byleth reported, also ignoring Shez, “She appeared to be under the impression that he had murdered Pittacus, her previously mentioned sister, and another individual named Thales.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea stiffened. She knew that name. She remembered that name. He was alive? Though, no, he was dead, that was what Byleth’s words implied, but how long had he been alive? Had he survived to the present day? How could that… “I see. Did either Solon or Bias state anything in regard to those two individuals and the manner in which they died?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, they didn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…well, I remember Bias was really upset about her sister’s death,” Shez said, thinking back to what she remembered of that conversation, “I think they were twins? And she didn’t care at all about that Thales guy. I don’t think either of them really liked him all that much, there was something about how he didn’t really matter or whatever. Oh, and that Solon guy thought he killed himself, I think.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea frowned. “Hm…so they didn’t know anything about the circumstances of his death?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhh…I think Solon knew something? There was…something about magic and…earth? Like rocks, I guess?” Shez shrugged. “They also thought I was working for somebody named…Cleo-something. I don’t think I’ve ever been hired by somebody named that though. Bias got pissed off when I didn’t know what she was talking about though, smacked me in the face and everything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea grimaced slightly at the evidence of physical harm, though it did act as proof that these supposed Agarthans cared little for Shez’s well-being. Odd how a bruise could be evidence in the young woman’s favor… “Well, I am sorry you went through such a harrowing experience here. The monastery is meant to be a safe place for our students.” She sighed. “Though I suppose there has been a great deal of danger this year…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There has, but we can't focus on that," Byleth responded, "For now, we just need to make sure everyone is safe." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, that is true…" Rhea let out a sigh. "I ask that neither of you two mention what was talked about here for now. Please make sure to get some rest for now, and send Catherine in." Nodding, the two sisters left, and a moment later, Catherine came in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you need something, Lady Rhea?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I want you to up the guard around the monastery. I’ve already informed Jeralt, but I would prefer we reinforce security as soon as possible. I doubt there could be another infiltrator on the staff already present, not after we discovered the truth behind Tomas and his accomplice Jeritza, but we should ensure no one else makes their way in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, alright. And, uh…do you want me or Shamir to keep any kind of eye on the Eisners?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea paused, frowning in thought, before she shook the idea off. “No, I doubt they’ll need an escort. Or a shadow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You sure? Shez claims she got lost all on her own, so giving her a minder in general might be a good idea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I would rather not aggravate her, or Jeralt for that matter. Perhaps you can let the knights know to ask her if she’s going in the right direction if they see her meandering.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, I’ll let them know. If that’s all?” At Rhea’s nod, Catherine saluted and left the chamber, before letting out an annoyed sigh. She still wasn’t sure why exactly Lady Rhea cared so much about the Eisners having a good opinion of her, but she wasn’t about to sabotage her boss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though she could at least admit to herself that any poor dastard that went after Shez was going to face hell from Byleth. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>It was weird how quickly things could go back to normal after a big event, but, honestly, Shez was pretty happy to get back to her average routine. The blood-stealing weirdos that tried to abduct her were no longer a factor in her day-to-day life, so back to classes she went!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which of course meant getting to know her new classmates! Which, well, she already kinda knew them, but getting to know them better! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now then, before class finishes for today, I just want to inform you all that there will be no mission this month. After what happened with Tomas and Jeritza, the knights will be investigating around the monastery, and until further notice, you will be asked to stay within Garreg Mach and not go into town unless given express permission." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? Come on professor, you can't be serious!" Hilda immediately complained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What happened with Jeritza?" Shez asked in a low whisper to Lysithea, who stared at her in disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did no one tell you?" Lysithea asked. "Jeritza was the Death Knight." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What!?" In her surprise, Shez might have said that a bit too loudly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, did you want to ask something?" Manuela asked as she raised an eyebrow at Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"N-No, sorry about that," Shez apologized, bowing a bit as she heard Lysithea let out a huff and call her an idiot under her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I'm sure there's plenty of things we can do at the monastery, in fact, why don't we have a feast to celebrate our new classmate joining the class?" Claude suggested, immediately earning a cheer from Raphael. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah! Meat party!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, don't forget about me!" Balthus called out. "You guys didn't throw a feast for me!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pretty sure that's cause of how hectic things got," Leonie commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh yeah…well, either way, I'll forgive you guys if you make sure there's booze!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There will be no such thing at our festivities," Lorenz chided. "I understand that you may be a brute, but none of us are old enough to drink." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, I am, but don't think they'd let me drink at the monastery," Leonie pointed out, "Unless they're okay with that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The church does respect the drinking age of respective nations. That being said, I doubt they'll be okay with you drinking around minors," Manuela informed, not that she could scold anyone with how bad her drinking habits were. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, dammit, guess I’ll have to visit Abyss later,” Balthus muttered to himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do try not to have too much fun during the feast! And make sure to keep in mind the knights might come by to ask you questions if they need to.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure thing, professor! Come on Ignatz, we have a party to start!” Raphael said, a large smile on his face, before he grabbed the smaller boy to carry him out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–Raphael, I can walk on my own!” the bespectacled boy protested, to little effect as he was carried away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, guess we should get a move on before Raphael finishes off all the food before the feast even begins,” Claude said with an amused smile as he followed behind along with Hilda, who didn’t look as happy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. It’s a shame Marianne isn’t around to join.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not like she likes this kind of thing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Trying to hide her amused smile at Hilda’s pout, Shez followed behind her classmates. Was certainly fun learning this was going to be a common thing for her now, since Claude definitely liked his feasts. Though according to him it was a Golden Deer only thing, so no inviting her sister, apparently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…hey, do you mind if we speak in private?” Lysithea asked as the Golden Deer watched Balthus and Raphael have an arm-wrestling competition. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure. Good luck Raphael, I still have five gold on you!” Shez cheered on as she got up. Following behind the shorter mage, the two found themselves in a secluded area where they could talk. “What’s up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “I…wanted to talk about what happened in the underground,” Lysithea said, unease evident in her voice. “About what Solon said.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh uh…mind telling me the specifics? He said a lot of things to me beforehand, but I don’t know what exactly he told you since I was out of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He said you…had your uses. Do you have any idea what he meant by that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah… Right…” Frowning, Shez seemed to be thinking deeply for a moment. “He said something…he called me a failed experiment. I don’t know what he meant by that, but it was apparently to give me some type of power.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...and you don’t remember anything about it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, from what he said, it kinda sounds like they started doing it when I was born. As far as I remember, my first memory is waking up in a bed with my mom bringing me food.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I think I know who was behind what happened to you,” Lysithea said, trembling a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, you do?” Shez asked, surprised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s only a theory! I just…I can't say anything for certain. I just have an idea of who it could be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hey, Lys, we don’t need to talk about this if you’re not feeling up for it. Just, uh…can I ask something real quick?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Th-That depends on the question,” Lysithea said, trying to ignore the stammer in her voice. She shouldn’t feel nervous, she was just with Shez, but…she was certain she knew who these people were, and the thought of them still terrified her. “But go ahead, I’ll answer it if you really want me to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright. Does it have to do with how you’re also really great at dark magic?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I despise your implication that I only have these powers because of those people–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah, what? No, that’s not what I meant!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>But!</span>
  </em>
  <span> I cannot deny that my talent with dark magic was likely influenced by their effects on my life. And…yes, they did affect me. And I’m not talking about it right now, okay!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay! Okay, that’s fine by me! I don’t mind if you don’t want to talk about it.” Trying to keep a smile on her face, Shez kept her gaze on Lysithea. "Just… whenever you feel up for it, I'll be up to talk about it, okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I know, I just need time to think about it first."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Thanks for trusting me with this, Lys." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, if you are to be my apprentice, then it's only right we learn about each other, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well well, here I knew you two were close, but I didn't know you were that close." Interrupting the moment, Claude walked up his usual smile on his face. "Didn't know you were growing up so quickly Lysithea." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wh-Shut up Claude!" Lysithea yelled, her face getting flushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, no need to get so embarrassed. It's all a part of getting older," Claude teased, getting Lysithea to glance at Shez for a moment, before she ran off in embarrassment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What the hell, Claude? You know she doesn't like getting treated like a kid," Shez complained, frowning at her house leader. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, I'll apologize to her later. Just wanted to talk with you for a bit," Claude explained. "Specifically, as your house leader, I felt it only right to follow up on what happened." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Starting to think I should just gather everyone around so I don't have to repeat myself so often…"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to, just wanted to make sure you're okay," Claude said without his usual inquisitiveness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Were you listening in on us?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just the tail end of the conversation, I swear," he said with a wink, "Though if you feel like telling me about it, I won't say no." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Look, just, I still don't know how much of what he said was true or not, okay? For all I know, he was completely lying." Though she had a feeling he wasn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… is that so?" Claude asked, still intrigued. "Well, I'll take your word on it. Though I hope you don't mind if we talk later as well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just don't eavesdrop when I'm talking with someone, okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure thing. Now come on, we have a party to get back to. Speaking of, you lost out on the bet." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really? Dammit!" Charging back in, Shez went to check to see if she had actually lost, while Claude stayed behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…" A sister who could wield the Sword of the Creator and had the Crest of Flames, and a sister with no crest, but who had her own special powers, and a powerful sword of her own. Maybe it shouldn't be just the Church he should try investigating…</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Sometime later, Shez laid down in her bed, staring up at her ceiling as she let out a sigh. Whatever her powers were, they seemed to come from a dark place, one that might have hurt others… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let out a slow sigh, not noticing as the spirit she was attached to manifested beside her bed. A small frown crossed the pale being’s face, his eyes narrowed for a moment, before he put a hand to his head and feigned some pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh…what happened?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Arval? Where have you been?" Shez asked, sitting up once she heard the voice of her partner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I do not know. I suppose I feel… drained," Arval stated, the spirit looking tired as they appeared once again before Shez. "Last I remember was that old librarian cornering us, and then the next thing I know, I awakened here. I…feel as though all my energy is gone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah… hey Arval, does the word Agartha seem familiar?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Agartha? …Agartha…" Saying the world to themself, Arval seemed to be testing it, as if it did spark something. They looked thoughtful, considering, before picking an answer. "...It feels familiar. Perhaps in a more positive manner than negative.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? Well, that still doesn't help much…" Shez muttered, frowning to herself. "You also missed a whole lot…hey Arval, your power isn't anything bad, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? What do you mean?" Arval asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just… thinking about something. What the Tomas guy told me is rubbing me the wrong way." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…well, I can promise you this. You are my partner in destiny, and I would never betray you," Arval reassured, smiling down at her, "If I was against you, I would have just guided you to a den of demonic beasts long ago." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey! I'm not dumb enough to fall for something like that!" Shez said, getting Arval to quirk an eyebrow. "...I would have fought my way out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you say so, partner. For now, I shall get some rest, and you should do the same," they said, before dissipating, leaving Shez with just her thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Sighing, she laid back down. Her mind drifted to her awakened form. "..."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wouldn't use it again, not unless it was necessary.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Before we start, do you mind if I ask you a favor?" Byleth asked as she and Edelgard sat down for tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh?" Cursing herself for the slight stutter, Edelgard composed herself. "What exactly do you need?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can you have Hubert leave?" Byleth said, keeping her voice low. "This is something I only want to discuss with you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah." Edelgard couldn't help but stiffen, as for a brief moment, fear that she had been found out gripped her heart. "...very well." Sending a discrete signal, Edelgard heard the bushes nearby rustle for a moment as Hubert moved away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you," Byleth said, with a small smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...So, what exactly did you want to discuss, professor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's about something I discovered when we rescued Flayn and Shez." Byleth said, getting Edelgard to pause. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What exactly did you find out?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I think there might be another infiltrator in the monastery," Byleth said, getting Edelgard’s breath to hitch. "Aside from whoever that Bias person was." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Stay calm, Edelgard thought to herself as she sipped from her tea. Don't show any faults. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...what exactly makes you think that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Reaching into her coat, Byleth pulled out a knife. A distinctly Agarthan looking knife. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"When we were leaving the area, I found this on the floor. No one we were fighting had this knife, but someone dropped it," Byleth said, her brow furrowed. "I don't know what it's made of, but I think it's the same as the Scythe Jeritza was using." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is?" Edelgard asked, trying to seem curious. Which quickly shifted into shock as she saw Byleth bring the knife up to cut her palm. "P-Professor!?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's just a light wound, but–" Showing her palm where a light trail of blood was leaking, Byleth tried to heal it, and while it partially closed, it didn't fully heal up. "Whatever this material is made up of, it seems to be specifically meant to go against faith magic." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You didn't need to cut yourself like that, professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wanted to demonstrate what I discovered." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And how exactly does this mean there's an infiltrator?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Someone dropped the knife, but it was only after the fight ended. And it was where everyone was standing," Byleth explained as she frowned. "I don't want to think any of the students might be an imposter, but the possibilities are too high right now." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...And may I ask why you're sharing this with me rather than Lady Rhea?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Because I trust you." With a sheer sincerity that baffled Edelgard, she continued. "The only ones who it can't be are Flayn and Shez, since they were held captive, and you, who wasn't even there. If I were to tell Rhea, then she might interrogate everyone and make it obvious we know what's going on." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I see."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And… if I'm being honest, it's just a feeling I have. You've said I have a strange aura about me, and it feels like you do too. Whatever it is, it makes me feel like I can trust you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Is that so?" Keeping herself steady, Edelgard’s mind raced. On the one hand, a part of her felt elated to be trusted by her professor, but on the other hand, she was being trusted despite actively lying to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I don't have any plans yet, but I just want you to keep an eye out for anything suspicious." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Of course professor." She could work with this. If she worked this properly, she could have both Selene and Emily out of the monastery. She just had to plan things properly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you." Grabbing the knife, Byleth hid it in her coat again. "Now then, we still have to plan what to do for the Battle of Eagle and Lion next month as well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I would think that wouldn't be as important," Edelgard said, getting Byleth to shake her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even if the infiltrators are the bigger problem, we still can't ignore what's to come. Besides, with how the mock battle ended up being a mess, it's only proper I help bring victory to the Black Eagles next time, right? Not to mention, I did promise to bring you victory." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." She just had to squash down the feeling of infatuation. She was the Flame Emperor, someone who would bring forth a new age for the people of Fodlan, free of the crest system and the tyranny of the Church. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have to say, I didn't think I'd end up enjoying being a teacher this much. I'm really glad we met, Edelgard."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Me too, professor." But, for now, she could enjoy these peaceful days. </span>

  <p>
  <span>“Did you hear? They’re saying Tomas was the one behind the abduction of those students,” one monk mentioned to another in the depths of the library.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? I thought it was that combat instructor, Jeritza von Hrym?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was, but Tomas was apparently the one behind it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? But he was such a sweet old man…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well you know what they say about those you least suspect. Granted, I think anybody could have suspected Jeritza was up to something. He was always wearing that weird mask.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True…well, what happened? I heard there was a fight in the knight’s quarters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Captain Jeralt took care of things, from what I heard. Him and his daughter, that new professor, killed Tomas but Jeritza managed to get away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really?? Oh that’s scary to think, he could still be out there then…hm. Hey, how do you think Sister Selene is taking it? She and Tomas seemed really close.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good question. I can’t imagine she’s not upset.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Further in the library, the woman known to most as Selene, a nun of the monastery, hummed quite cheerfully to herself as she stocked the shelves with returned books, enjoying the simple repetition of the activity as she moved along. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tragically, the happy mood she had cultivated was broken quite suddenly as she felt a familiar brat grab her by the front of her robes and pull her close.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>hell </span>
  </em>
  <span>was that?!” Kronya, in her standard guise of Emily Korsch, hissed in her face, her eyes narrowed in genuine anger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Bias simply gripped the young woman’s wrist and started to squeeze. “Let go. I don’t want to rip these robes when I break your wrist.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...bitch,” Kronya cursed, letting go. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rather than break her wrist as stated, Bias simply let go as well. It was a kindness the idiot in front of her hadn’t really earned, but one she was willing to grant. “What do you want, brat? I’m not interested in playing confessional.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Are you–You can’t be serious! You–You murdered Solon!” she hissed, just barely remembering to keep her voice down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would it help if I said it was on the orders of our leaders?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What–It was?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not. I was just asking if saying that would help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya scowled. “Then why!? What could possibly justify killing one of our own!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ahahaha–Hahahahahaha–” Bias covered her mouth with hand, trying to stifle the laughter that threatened to echo through the entire library as her composure nearly broke from what was quite possibly the stupidest question the brat in front of her had ever asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya, meanwhile, stepped back slightly, an unfamiliar discomfort filling her at the sight of her superior nearly cracking completely right in front of her. Sure, she knew her question was hypocritical; Kronya had killed plenty of her lessers for failure before, but that was different. Those were peons, worthless in the long run. None of them were a sage, and especially not their people’s greatest living mage. Even if he had been an old asshole.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Finally, Bias regained some composure, and simply smiled at Kronya, who could still see hints of that amusement dancing in her superior’s eyes like flickering flames. “You really are a good little puppy, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–” Whatever offense Kronya felt was cut off by confusion as Bias patted her on the head. “...W-What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It really is no wonder Thales kept you around. Vicious, but loyal. Not like that cold bastard Solon. You know he investigated Thales’s demise, right? And he found evidence of foul play, but he kept it quiet, because it didn’t matter to him.” Bias grinned. “He was willing to hide everything so long as he got to play as the great savior of this world.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…what are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m saying he had to go, puppy. A callous man like that, who cares nothing for the lives under his command, can’t be trusted. Sure, if someone fails, kill them, that’s how it works. But to disregard their lives entirely, to act as though even the death of our great leader doesn’t matter…well, a man like that would be willing to sacrifice anyone. Could you really say he wouldn’t, if it seemed convenient?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Kronya wasn’t sure what to say to that. Would Solon have sacrificed her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…If it was for the good of the world, he would have. That old creep always went on and on about that kind of thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...But you were the one who killed him,” she pointed out, still on guard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was, but does anyone need to know that? The only people who know that truth are here at this monastery, and who among them would report to our superiors? The students, who know nothing of Agartha? The Death Knight, a mad dog who didn’t even witness the moment? The Flame Emperor, perhaps? Though, she doesn’t trust us, now does she? Perhaps she could use that information to ruin us, or maybe she’ll use it to keep us close. Do you have an idea of which choice she would make?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-Wait, there isn’t an ‘us’ here, you’re the one–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who killed Solon, yes. We’ve gone over that. Every other witness of merit, our poor Agarthan brethren, was slain along with him. And it was the spear of that princely brat that killed him, wasn’t it? All I did was burn the body to make sure it wouldn’t be used by our enemies.” Bias smiled. “It would make things much more convenient if he died by that boorish lion’s hands, wouldn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Kronya felt a strange shiver go up her spine. It dawned on her that Bias truly didn’t care what Kronya said. If she made herself an inconvenience, Bias was going to kill her. That they were in the middle of enemy territory didn’t matter. There was no mistaking that glint in the sage’s eyes, not when Kronya had that exact same look many times before when she was dealing with an inconvenient lesser.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she really didn’t like being on the other side of that look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...F-Fine. Fine. The prince killed him. Everything else was just a tragedy. I get it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I knew you would. Believe me, pup. I’m a much better master to have than Cleobulus or Myson. Now scurry along, if you would. Be a good schoolgirl, and I’ll let you know if I ever need you for anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Kronya turned and left, unhappy to show any deference to the mad sage, but well aware that it was her only choice if she wanted to leave the library alive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias watched her leave with a faint smile, then turned to the shelves, tilting her head in thought. “...Hm. Perhaps it’s time I branch out…Fire alone is quite limiting. Wouldn’t you agree, your highness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Edelgard stepped around the shelves with a frown, staring at the disguised sage. “You’re being careless.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What can I say? I’m grieving the recent death of my father and a surprising betrayal by a colleague. I’m allowed to be upset.” She smiled. “And I do take steps to ensure I am not overheard, princess. Now do you want something from me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want to know what your plans are. You ki–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Careful now, princess. You should be quieter in the library. Why don’t we find somewhere better to speak?” And without waiting for a response, she turned and started walking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard clenched her jaw, her eyes narrowed, before she followed, well aware of Hubert keeping a careful eye on both of them. If the sage tried anything, he would intervene.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t, though the walk to the storeroom was tense and uncomfortable. Not that Bias seemed even slightly fazed. “You really should be more careful, princess. You could have at least asked to meet me outside of the monastery." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Talking to you here lessened the chance of you attempting to pull something on me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, if you say so. Though you never know. I don’t really have much to lose at this point. Really, I should just leave. Nothing is keeping me here with Solon's death." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...And why aren't you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Because I still owe you, and because of Solon’s words before everything happened, I know for sure that Shez is innocent." With a smile, she pat Edelgard on the head, making her stiffen before she smacked her arm away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't touch me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, and here I thought we could work well together. Surely an Emperor can do with more help from the shadows?" She smiled at her. It wasn’t a pleasant smile. “You told me the truth, princess. I appreciate that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. Do you truly wish to avenge Thales that much?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t give a damn about him. Whoever killed him killed my twin though. So I want to find whoever did it and kill them. Simple as that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I see.” That was a problem then. She couldn’t let Bias kill her professor under any circumstance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, there's no need to be so tense. You already helped rule out Shez, so that beloved professor of yours isn't in danger. And I doubt any of those Eagles could have been involved. Really, it seems everyone you care about is safe from me," Bias mused with a smirk, "Ah, but a fair warning. Kronya seems on edge right now, so she might lash out if pushed too much." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph. I'm surprised you haven't thrown her under the carriage yet." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, that's still an option. The thing is, she might not be a sage, but she's still dangerous. If she sees herself going down, she'll try to take whoever she can with her. Cornered rats, as they say." Bias shrugged. “If you want my advice, and I doubt you do but I’m going to give it anyway, just leave her be for the moment. She doesn’t have anywhere to go, especially since she has no reason to trust going to Myson or Cleobulus will turn out better for her than riding things out with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re hoping she’ll take the safe, familiar option instead of risking uncertainty then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s one way of looking at it. The thing is, we Agarthans know our places in life. She won’t bite because she’s trained not to. And if she does, she dies. It’s that simple.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You’re asking me to afford you a great deal of trust, especially given how you killed your own superior.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did, true. And, really, under most circumstances I would likely be in some real trouble just for surviving while he died, since it was my job to keep him alive. But I have resources to bargain with and my placement near the abominations gives an advantage my fellow sages of equal standing wouldn’t want to lose.” She smirked. “And that’s an important part to note here. With Thales and now Solon dead, I don’t have superiors. The other sages are of equal rank to me, rivals instead of leaders, and that means they need to work carefully. Especially with how divided things are right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And how divided are they?” Edelgard questioned, “If you want me to trust you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold on now, princess, I’m fine with telling you what’s going on. Maybe not all the details, I do need some reasons for why </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> should keep me around too, but to keep things simple, Myson is in charge of our operations in Adrestia while Cleobulus handles things in Faerghus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. And the third remaining sage, Chilon, he’s in the Alliance?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, he’s probably in Adrestia too right now. He’s not exactly a subtle man and our people have never been particularly interested in Leicester. I assume it’s because you Adrestians sided with our ancient enemy while the Faerghans have always been easy to manipulate. Nemesis was even from those lands, if you can believe it. Almost makes them our ‘natural allies’,” she joked, smirking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned, wondering if she was supposed to take anything in particular from that…and deciding she might as well ask as long as Bias was willing to answer. “Is Dimitri involved with this ‘Cleobulus’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I doubt it. She had a hand in that Tragedy up there, but if Cleobulus had successfully suborned the prince, odds are she would be keeping him close instead of letting him wander to Garreg Mach.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She could have her hand forced by circumstance. The nobles would want him to attend the Academy for tradition’s sake.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True, but I doubt it. I can’t see the lion prince as anything more than a hapless idiot stumbling in the dark and grasping at shadows. Maybe he’ll blunder into causing us trouble, but I doubt he’ll be anything more than the boar his ‘friend’ derides him as.” She huffed, amused. “Really, it’s a show of how weak he is that he hasn’t put down that yapping hound yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Killing the heirs of a noble house usually carries consequences,” Edelgard noted, giving Bias a warning look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know, I know, no touching the students. I wasn’t planning to anyway, but you have my solemn oath that I especially will not harm any of your house,” she swore, though her smile made it hard to trust her words, “Besides, you’re the one that should keep an eye out. That Riegan mutt was peeking around not long after our little event, likely seeking some hint of Solon’s intentions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That makes your continued presence here remarkably dangerous. If he finds a connection–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, I’ll be out of your hair soon enough. I have other things to handle while I can. I just didn’t want to burn this disguise if I can avoid it. Having access to this monastery is quite useful, as I’m sure you’ve found, and I would hate to lose it. I just need to be careful in how I move, and I assure you, I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> careful when I want to be. If that is all, your highness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard felt like she should talk more. Maybe tell her about Professor Byleth’s investigation, though she disregarded that thought almost immediately. Setting this woman after the professor for any reason was a bad idea. She almost wanted to ask more too, to see if she could discover something else from the loose-lipped Slitherer, but… “Are you willing to tell me anything about Myson or Cleobulus’s plans?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not for nothing, princess. Besides, you assume I know everything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She expected that answer. “Very well then. That is all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias smirked, amused to watch the Imperial princess turn towards the door, her discomfort hidden by a mask of stoicism as she tried to pretend she wasn’t fleeing–Then the sage paused when she saw Edelgard turn around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I doubt it will mean much, but…I understand what it is like to lose loved ones.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias scoffed. “Trying to get me to sympathize with you, princess? Don’t forget our positions here. What you are, and what I am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard’s eyes narrowed. “I know you are a monster. I don’t want your sympathies. I just…never mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re too soft, princess,” the sage called out before Edelgard could leave, “You should harden that heart of yours before someone wounds it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That advice is far too late.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, the princess left, and Bias was alone again.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Kronya wandered aimlessly through the monastery, unsure of what to do. She couldn't trust her superior, but she also knew going against her would label her a traitor, even if she managed to get away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This was supposed to be a simple mission, damn it! Just infiltrate the monastery and get close to the princess, but no, she just had to warn the red-headed beast so they missed their chance there. Now all she had was this useless disguise that Edelgard saw through immediately! Why couldn't they have just let her keep dealing with traitors!? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was only a matter of time until Bias saw her as more trouble to keep around; it was clear to the younger Agarthan that she was already expendable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Dammit!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, everything okay?" Turning on her heel, Kronya found Shez standing nearby. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-What do you want?!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing? Just checking on you. You seem like something is pissing you off." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's nothing that involves you," Kronya responded, scowling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh… okay? You sure you don't want to talk about it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why do you care?" She didn't know what Solon meant, but… if she was really ignorant about her nature… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, you're my friend, right?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Excuse me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I mean, sure you got your issues. I mean, a lot of issues really, but we're still friends, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Taking a step back, Kronya's scowl deepened. Even if Shez was an Agarthan, she was no better than a beast if she truly cared about other beasts like they were her 'family and friends'.  She wouldn't stoop so low, she'd figure out a way to come out on top, even if Bias or anyone else was against her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Guessing it's something personal then," Shez said, a bit sheepishly. "Well how about we go train? You said you wanted to get stronger, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would I want to!? You’re just some…you’re just…” Somehow, she couldn’t get the insult out. Why couldn’t she? She couldn’t really–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya stiffened as Shez put a hand on her shoulder. She was about to snap at her when she saw the concern on the girl’s face and the words died in her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, are you okay? You’re looking really upset right now.” Shez smiled, trying to be reassuring. “Whatever it is, I’m here for you, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” She knew she should shove Shez away. She knew she should outright punch the other girl in the face, if not cut her throat for being some kind of…discarded reject. But her body wasn’t moving. “...I really want to hit something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, alright, then let’s head to the training yard! We can find some dummies to smash! You ever tried using a warhammer before? It’s weirdly cathartic to break stuff with one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would I use a hammer?” Kronya asked derisively as she allowed Shez to start leading her onward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like I said, it’s cathartic! Besides, hammers are really good against heavy armor! For some reason. I don’t know exactly, probably something about blunt stuff working better, but By mentioned it before and she usually knows her stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya rolled her eyes, but followed the chatty girl anyway. Thinking about it, she would need allies if she wanted to break away from Bias and survive in this place, right? And this idiot thought of her as a friend already, which was better than any of these other beasts…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though, thinking about it some more…if she couldn’t get close to Edelgard, why not throw her lot in with a different beast? One that didn’t know anything about her at all? Yeah, that made sense, and since Shez was already close to that Claude guy, Kronya had an easy in!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yeah, the more she thought about it, the better of an idea it sounded! That von Riegan brat was bound to be way easier to manipulate than Little Miss Flame Emperor, so clearly this was the best plan!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Shez,” Kronya spoke up with a sudden smile, catching the girl’s attention, “How easy do you think it would be for me to transfer classes?”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“And that concludes my report on everything that happened in the underground chambers,” Jeralt finished, his arms folded behind his back as he stood at attention in front of Lady Rhea in her audience chambers. The archbishop looked worn out by the end of his summation, her shoulders slumped with more exhaustion than he’d ever seen on her before. “Do you have any questions?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Goddess…” Seteth muttered from his place beside Rhea, looking genuinely horrified, “Rhea, you don’t think–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know, Seteth. Believe me, I have already…Never mind.” She took a breath, then focused on Jeralt again. “The woman, Bias. You are certain she said that a man named Thales was dead?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Apparently she thought Solon killed him along with someone else named Pittacus,” Jeralt answered, “I’m guessing you already heard that from Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did, though she had some trouble recalling the specifics of the matter. Still, she did give a number names that were important. Solon, the leader of these conspirators. Bias, his apprentice and murderer. Pittacus, the murdered twin to Bias. Thales, an unknown individual of some significance who was also killed. And Cleo, some type of rival or threat to them.” Rhea tried to smile. “Altogether, it was actually an impressive amount of information for someone in her situation, even if there is still much to investigate. Still, I do not hold her difficulties against her, Jeralt. Anyone would have trouble remembering things properly after such an experience.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Anyone would, yeah. So why did you decide to interrogate her without me there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seteth frowned. “That’s not what happened, Captain–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine, Seteth. Jeralt has his reasons. I am sure you would feel similar if I were to request to speak with Flayn alone after her own traumatic experience,” Rhea said, prompting a slight frown from her chamberlain, before she looked back to Jeralt, “It was not my intention to speak with Shez so soon. I intended to speak with Byleth, but Shez was with her and Catherine decided to bring them both.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt didn’t look like he believed her, and that prompted a slight, disappointed frown from Rhea. “Do you really trust me so little, Jeralt?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have kids to take care of, Rhea. I can’t afford to trust you like I did before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That is quite blunt, but…I suppose I can understand.” She sighed. “Thank you for your time, Jeralt. You may return to your duties.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, no.” She blinked at the refusal while Jeralt stood firm. “You need to talk to me, Rhea. I need to know who these people are and why they went after my kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Jeralt, I understand your concern–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you don’t. Otherwise you would have told me that Aelfric had stolen my wife’s body and tried to resurrect her and kidnapped my daughter, and I wouldn’t have had to hear it from her instead. You would have told me what happened to Sitri and why Byleth’s heart doesn’t beat, back before I left. You would be telling me, right now, who these people are and how they’re connected to Shez. You wouldn’t be keeping me in the dark just because the truth is uncomfortable, you would tell me just what the hell is going on here and why my family keeps being put in danger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His tone was calm and even through every word, with barely a change in inflection, and yet Rhea felt as though every insistence was a blow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Captain, I understand where you're coming from, but that is no way to speak to the Archbishop," Seteth reprimanded, frowning, "Once we have discussed things properly, then you will be informed." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, Rhea, how much have you told your aide about me?" Jeralt asked, wanting to see how much he knew. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I have known him for much longer than you, Jeralt," Rhea said, before looking over at Seteth. "And Jeralt holds my blood within him, Seteth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"....I see." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And Jeralt, before I tell you, you must know that…what I have learned may lead to many issues not just for your family, but all of Fodlan. I understand you want to protect your family, but if we are not careful, then we may throw the entire continent into chaos.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am not certain why your youngest was targeted, but it seems those behind her abduction still have plans for her. I already instructed the knights to keep an eye on Shez so if anything were to happen, she would be safe."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt stared at her, stone-faced. "You're still avoiding the question of just who these people are." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Very well. They're an enemy of mine that I have long since thought dead. I do not know what exactly they are planning, but the last time I fought them they nearly destroyed all of Fodlan. Once I'm done having my knights investigate the monastery, I'll be having them on missions to investigate the nation for any clue on them. I pray that I can have your assistance on this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Fine, but no more secrets, okay? If you find anything out, you tell me right away." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, Jeralt. I swear to you," Rhea said, trying to keep the guilt off her face. Maybe one day, he would understand just what exactly she had planned… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon enough though, Jeralt left and it was only her and Seteth in her office once more. Rhea let out a slow sigh and sunk back in her seat, resisting the urge to massage her temples. “We need to up the security around the monastery. Perhaps if we call the other knights back…” She grimaced. “If only we could still trust the Western Church, I could have their forces reinforcing ours…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, it is a concerning matter, Lady Rhea. As is what Captain Jeralt discussed earlier.” She paused and looked up at her chamberlain, who was facing her with his hands behind his back. “Such as the circumstances behind Lady Sitri’s origins.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a moment, Rhea felt as though the world had stopped around her. Then Seteth’s words registered and her eyes widened, before narrowing. “...Would you care to explain what you mean, Seteth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He held up his hands. “I don’t mean it as an accusation. I understand…I understand that things have been difficult for you these past thousand years. I wasn’t here to help, nor were any of the other saints that fought alongside us. You have had to work on your own, without any aid from another of our people. Still…it does appear you have found those you can care for, even if you cannot trust them as deeply as you would wish to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Of all the places Rhea had thought this conversation could go, this was not one of them. “I…appreciate your words, Seteth. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I hope you understand, I am on your side, Lady Rhea. It took some time, but after the revelations of what occurred in Abyss, the truth of the matter became clear. There are other matters we should discuss when we can, but I understand now why you have been so set on keeping Byleth Eisner here as the new professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea couldn’t help but blink. “You do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed. The truth became clear when I looked into the events that occurred. Why Lady Sitri’s body did not decay with time, your relationship with her…I suppose I have been foolish not to notice before, but it is difficult to speak of lost loved ones. Even now, I find it difficult to speak of my own wife…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, it is difficult…to be clear, Seteth, you are aware of…” She tried to find a way to phrase her plans tactfully. “...Of young Byleth’s nature?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am. Just as I am aware of Sitri’s connection to you, Rhea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I see.” Rhea did her absolute best to keep herself steady. Hope and dread warred in her mind as she stared at her chamberlain. Her brother. “And what do you think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think you should tell Jeralt sooner rather than later, but I have no qualms with your decisions otherwise,” Seteth advised, "The longer you hide it, then the more difficult it will be for him to accept it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…I see what you mean." Would he be able to accept her plan? "Though it may still be early for me to tell him, given what just happened." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…Yes, it may shock him more than you meant," Seteth mused, "Would it be okay if I were to inform Flayn?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now that definitely came as a shock to Rhea. "You wish to inform her?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I'll make sure to tell her that she is not to tell anyone, but I'm sure she would be delighted to know the truth." A rare grin appeared on his face. "Truth be told, that is partially the reason why I trust Byleth now." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I must admit, I never thought you would be so accepting of this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Trust me, it came as quite the shock for me as well. Though I'm sure Jeralt and Byleth will be more than understanding." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea was starting to wonder just when Seteth became so accepting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Though I must say, I never thought you of all people would have a lover." Rhea would be eternally grateful Seteth was looking away from her at that exact moment because she was unable to stop her eyes from bulging in shock. "To think, if I had joined you sooner, I could have met your daughter." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea was starting to realize Seteth just completely misunderstood what was going on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"While I understand that, as the Archbishop, you cannot let it be known you had an illicit relationship, you should still inform Byleth as well, as it would help clear the air between you two." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I see. Thank you for your advice on the matter." Rhea was practiced at keeping calm in the face of sudden issues. Or at least she liked to tell herself that. If she were being honest, she felt like she was sweating up a storm right now. “...To be clear, you support my, ah…” She cleared her throat, trying to figure out how to even begin addressing Seteth’s incorrect impression.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rhea, I wholeheartedly support your attempts to get closer to your granddaughter, and I am sorry I was not here to support you in your time of loss.” He bowed his head, before smiling. “I am also somewhat curious as to who managed to capture your heart enough to have a child with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I-I think that is a conversation we should have at a later date.” When she actually had an idea of who her false lover should even be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, of course. Er, if I may ask…is he no longer with us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh no, he’s asking follow-up questions.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “...ahh…he is…no longer present. At the monastery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seteth blinked. Then frowned. “I see. Was he a member of the church?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Would it be better if ‘he’ was?? </span>
  </em>
  <span>“Seteth, I think we should save this conversation for a later date. I appreciate your support in this…trying time, and, ah…perhaps we should move onto other matters? You said you had more you wished to discuss with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well, yes, I did wish to address your obvious attempt to break the taboo with that ‘rite of resurrection’ ritual,” Seteth replied, his tone turning flat and unamused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah. Yes. That…To be clear, Seteth, the rite was enacted during a moment of weakness and I have not made any other attempts since its failure,” Rhea explained, lying through her teeth, “I had just lost everyone close to me and…and I thought if I only had mother back, everything would go back to normal. So…I apologize, but I did what I thought was right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Seteth sighed. “I understand, Rhea. I do, truly. But the taboo is in place for a reason. To revive someone from the dead…you know as well as I that it is the only true commandment of the goddess. Still, I believe she would forgive you for that moment of weakness, and it is heartening to know you have learned your lesson.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes. Yes, I have.” Well, she was already lying to Seteth, so it wasn’t like this changed much. It was the first time she had to invent a false husband though…would it be too awkward if she asked one of her cardinals to pretend?</span>

  <p>
  <span>"Hey, I'm transferring out." Blinking, Byleth turned to face Emily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you sure?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, it’s not worth it staying in this class," she bluntly stated, getting Byleth to frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…okay. I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you feel more at ease in my class," Byleth apologized. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eesh, don't make it about yourself," Emily complained, frowning. "I just think I'll be a better fit in the Golden Deer." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Shez’s class?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, what about it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, well, I hope you enjoy your time there," Byleth said, nodding to Emily, who was already walking away. Straightening up, Byleth made her way to her class, feeling a bit disappointed. Sure, Emily didn't get along with her classmates, but a part of her had been hoping that would change. It also made her feel like she had made a mistake somewhere… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing you can do about it. You can't force someone to like you," Sothis remarked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Still feels like a shame…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, quite the greedy child you are. You have so many students in your class, and you want even more?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...It would mean the other classes would have less forces during the Battle of Eagle and Lion." Byleth noted, musing over that possible idea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There you are, professor!" Pausing, Byleth turned her head to see Flayn coming over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, hello Flayn, is everything okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh…more or less? Constance decided to try out a new spell and well… I think you should just go see,” Flayn said, gesturing for her to follow. A tad wary, Byleth followed Flayn, heading to their classroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And, well, it was hard to describe what she was seeing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ferdinand, when this is over, don't think you'll be getting off easily," Hubert muttered, his hands on Ferdinand’s chest as he tried to push him away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You say that as if I'm enjoying this!" Ferdinand shouted back, his arms on one of Hubert's shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can you please stop arguing already?” Edelgard requested, her hands on the desk in front of her, making no move to help them as Dorothea sat next to her with a slight smile, her hand on her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"C-Can someone please just help me!? Lindhart is too heavy for me to move!" Bernadetta whined from somewhere on the floor as Byleth heard Lindhart let out a small snore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey professor!” Caspar greeted with a wave of the axe in his hands. Which. Huh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah. You’re all stuck to each other,” Byleth figured out, prompting a sigh from Edelgard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, we are. Thanks to a certain heiress of House Nuvelle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh! Lady Edelgard, should I take that as confirmation that you intend to reinstate my household?!” Constance asked, visibly excited. And also standing with one hand on her hip and the other on her fan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t do that at the moment, Constance. In part because I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>stuck to my desk.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who else is stuck?” Byleth asked, glancing around the room and noticing that Marianne had her hands pressed together while Hapi seemed to have hers stuck against her lap.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“M-Mm…th-this is fine, professor. I, uh, d-do not need to use my hands…r-right now…I-I guess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Mari, I know you like praying, but I think even you’ll get tired of having your hands stuck in that position.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Petra, meanwhile, simply had her hands raised and was making a point of not touching anything. “Greetings, professor. This situation is one of some trouble.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seems like it. Flayn, you’re okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes! I made sure not to touch anything as I left, so I’m completely fine, professor! I don’t know if my hands will stick to anything, but I know you and Emily weren’t here to have the spell affect you, so I’m sure the both of you could help!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Emily transferred out today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh. Hm. That does make things more difficult…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Constance, do you have a counterspell for accidents like this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Constance scoffed. “This is no accident! My spell worked perfectly as intended!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You intended to stick your classmates to each other?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, no, I did not, but I did successfully guarantee Caspar would not lose his axe again!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, see? It’s super stuck here!” Caspar said, gesturing with said axe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do see that, but I also see your other classmates are being very inconvenienced. Do you have a way to counter the spell?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course not!” Constance huffed, sounding offended. “Why would I create a spell to demonstrate the ingenuity of House Nuvelle, only to then create another spell that goes against its exact purpose?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…but what about a spell that counters all spells?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Constance blinked. “...you’re a genius! Ah ha, this is why you’re my attendant!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m your professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Irrelevant!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Constance!” Edelgard snapped, making the blonde stiffen. “How long is this going to last?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, er…well, previous testing has shown that this spell does have something of a time limit, so it should not last more than an hour.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Did you just say we’re going to be stuck like this for an hour?” Hubert asked with a distinctly menacing tone to his voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Presumably less, given that we’ve already been stuck like this for a few minutes!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” It was probably a good thing Hubert’s hands were stuck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, in that case, I’ll just start the lesson. No one needs to take notes for this part,” Byleth said as she made her way to the front of the class, idly helping Bernadetta off the ground and moving Linhardt over to a chair, which did still leave the purple-haired girl in the very awkward position of sitting in his lap with her hands pressed to his chest. “For now, please take your seats and don’t touch anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, of course professor!” Flayn said before pulling out an empty chair at a desk and immediately realizing she got her hand stuck to the top of the chair. “...Oh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth sighed. “Alright, that’s my fault, I should have thought of that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, it’s okay professor! I think I can just-” Flayn put her other hand on the chair to adjust it, then immediately realized her mistake. Again. “...Hm. This is more difficult than anticipated.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine, just stand if that works better. Now then, for this week, we’re going to be covering–”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Hey, you're Lysithea, right?" Emily asked, staring down at the diminutive mage who was in the middle of studying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Oh, you're…Emily right? Did you need something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, uh…You’re really great at magic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Lysithea narrowed her eyes. “Are you patronizing me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Why the hell would you think–Wait, no. I’m not getting mad, because we’re just…talking. About magic, which is a thing you like.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you get to the point already? Why are you talking to me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I saw what you did with the Death Knight. That was impressive," Emily said, doing her best not to sound angry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, well, I suppose it was." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I mean, I don't use magic myself, but that really packed a hit," she continued, trying to seem relaxed. "So I was thinking that, since you and Shez already practice together, we could practice too. You know, since Shez and I already spar a lot together." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… I suppose I can see the benefit in that. Though just to be clear, I already have one apprentice, and I'm not taking another." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why would I want-" She cut herself off before she said anything rude. "Right, I get that. Besides, like I said, I don't use magic myself. Better with a bladed weapon." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Very well, it would benefit us both to know how we fight if we're to be in the same house together." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Great, looking forward to it!" Smirking as she turned away, she did her best to stop herself from laughing. Her plan was already going great! Two of the strongest Deer members were already in her pocket, and it was only a matter of time until the rest fell in line! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What a weird girl…" Lysithea muttered to herself as Emily walked away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now then, who should be next…" Walking across the courtyard, she paused as she saw the pink-haired beast clearly struggling to hold a crate. It was a wonder she could even hold it up with how much she was shaking. "What are you doing?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, is that you, Emily?" Hilda asked, seemingly glad to see her. "Nothing much, Professor Manuela asked me if I could help take some stuff over to store away. Shez was going to help me, but then Professor Manuela had her do something else." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I see," Emily said, as she began to walk away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, if only someone as strong, or maybe even stronger, than her were able to help me out." Until she heard those words and immediately turned back to grab the box. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just give it here," she grumbled as she took it away. Frowning as she took it, Emily noted that sure, the box was a bit heavy, but not enough to make anyone struggle. This Hilda girl must really be weak… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, thank you Emily! I owe you one!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm just doing this so you don't drop this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Still, you're super strong! I thought it would take me forever to carry the crates, but you can probably take multiple at once!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Crates?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, there's three of them, but I'm sure someone as strong as you can probably take them all at once! Heck, I don't even think Shez could carry that many." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, of course I'd be able to carry them all! I'm gonna be stronger than anyone else so this is nothing!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Great! Here, let's go get the rest! I knew you were going to be reliable Emily~" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Smirking to herself, she followed behind the pink beast. These students really were easy to manipulate, especially with how she already had one indebted to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Grinning to herself, Hilda tried to make sure Emily didn't see her face. Seemed the new girl reacted to praise and comparisons to Shez quite positively! Oh she was definitely going to be handy~. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"You know, I gotta say, getting a closer look at this thing makes me realize how freaky looking it is," Shez remarked as she studied the Lance of Ruin. "I mean the name is already weird, but this thing looks like it's made out of bone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh good, I'm not the only one who noticed that," Sylvain said as he held the Lance out for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I wouldn't say it's made out of bone, since I doubt bones would make good weapons, but whatever material it's made out of is certainly strange…" Ingrid muttered. "I wonder if I could ask my father if I could see Luin to compare them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, probably shouldn’t. Might end up with another arranged marriage proposal if you ask for something that important." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? What's up?" Shez asked, as she straightened up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing to worry about, just some offers my father has received," Ingrid replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sounds like it is something to worry about," Shez said, frowning. "But if you don't want to talk about it, okay." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, that's a surprise. With how much you keep butting in with your sister's love life I thought you'd jump at the chance to talk about Ingrid’s," Sylvain teased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, there's a difference between trying to get my sister to open up, and a friend dealing with something personal," Shez shot back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It really isn't that big of a deal," Ingrid said, trying to move the conversation along. "That aside, how are things in the Golden Deer?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, pretty good. Emily actually joined up too, and I think she's having fun. Well, at least, she's trying harder to get along with this class?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? Don't suppose that means I can take a chance if she isn't as surly~?" Sylvain asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah I'm pretty sure she'd probably still hit you if you tried that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not the worst rejection I've gotten at least." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sylvain, please don't,” Ingrid requested. “I don't even want to think of how much of a mess that will be." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it probably won't go well. Emily’s kind of unpleasant if she doesn’t like you, and I’m pretty sure her family raised her to have a low opinion of the Kingdom in general,” Shez noted, “She actually started being nicer to Dedue when she learned he’s from a different country.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow. Gotta admit, didn’t expect to hear that,” Sylvain said while Ingrid frowned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you friends with this girl again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I’m friends with you, right? Sometimes people have little prejudices they gotta get past.” Ingrid frowned at Shez’s summation, but she also couldn’t really contradict her. “I kind of get the feeling she hasn’t really had friends before now, so I guess part of me just wants to help her out, you know? Besides, the way I see it, she's the type to get along better with someone after a good fight. So she'll probably warm up to everyone after the big one next month."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...admittedly, I still have my reservations, but I can see what you mean." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, let's just hope this one doesn't become a mess like the mock battle," Sylvain said with a smirk towards Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey! That was an accident! And I already got permission to join in next month!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… I dunno, I still think you should make it up to us. Maybe by cluing us in on your house's plans for the battle?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, that's simple, I'll just be beating up whoever's in a different house." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, it's worked for me so far. If you're looking for big plans, you'll have to ask Claude." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not surprised there. Though I gotta say, now that we're down your strength, we're definitely going to be in a tight spot in the battle. Can't even brag about having a relic weapon with how your sister has one too." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, I'm sure you guys will figure out something. Dimitri has to have some plan in mind, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He probably does, though it'll likely need some polish." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How so?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know how Dimitri is. When it comes to being a leader, he can be a bit too softhearted," Ingrid said with a sigh. "He might end up playing it safely again. Which yes, it's not a real battle, but if he's not willing to lose soldiers in a mock battle, then I can't help but wonder how he'll do as a king." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, come on now Ingrid, no need to talk about something so serious,” Sylvain chided, “It'll just be a fun fight." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, though if you're that worried about losing, feel free to surrender already," Shez teased as she smirked, getting Ingrid to huff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't think it'll be that easy. One way or another, the Blue Lions will be taking the victory!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, bring it on!" </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The sound of wood hitting wood sounded out throughout the training grounds as Dimitri trained on his own. Keeping his focus intently on the wooden training dummy, he failed to notice the cracking sounds coming from his training spear until he brought it back, ready to thrust into the dummy, only for the spear to break as his grip tightened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Letting out an irritated sigh, he reached down to grab broken scraps. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was getting…harder, to control his strength. His anger continued to boil ever since he saw that dastard betray one of her own. He just couldn't understand it, what kind of person would kill the person who raised them!? What sort of vengeance could bring something like that about!?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Feeling his fists ball up, Dimitri was dimly aware of the broken wood in his hand getting crushed even further. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Would…Would he ever kill someone he cared about if it meant appeasing the dead? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The spirits seemed to roar to life at that, as if daring him to ever show hesitancy again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sorry, it was just a stray thought." Dimitri muttered to himself as he begged for them to leave him be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Dimitri?" A voice broke him free from the spirits as he looked over, finding Professor Byleth standing nearby.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor? Did you need something?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I thought I heard something loud," she said, glancing down at the broken spear. "Isn't it a little late to be training?" she asked, getting Dimitri to realize that the sun had indeed already set. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, my apologies, I lost track of the time," Dimitri explained, before getting back to cleaning. "I'll make sure to replace the damaged spear." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…do you want to spar?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You seem angry and a spar might help. It did for Edelgard when I first joined." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, no thank you, professor. I don’t think I should be sparring when I’m agitated like this,” he replied, before regarding the professor somewhat curiously, “Though I didn’t realize Edelgard had her own issues with anger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not really, it’s more that Ferdinand was annoying her and sparring helped her unwind. I can also understand why you might want to avoid sparring while angry.” She glanced at the training field, recalling the moment she’d nearly beaten Jeritza into the ground. It was almost funny to think that if she had killed him then while lost in her fury, he wouldn’t have been able to cut her open in the mausoleum or kidnap Flayn. Though she probably would have gotten in trouble for killing an instructor out of nowhere, so hm…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri, meanwhile, couldn’t help but remember that night too. “...How did you work past that anger, professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It took a while,” Byleth readily answered, turning back to the blond prince, “People helped me. I talked with Edelgard a few times about it, Shez was there for me, and I could actually confront Catherine about the problem I had with her. We sparred, and I didn’t lose my temper. Then we fought together and…I didn’t expect to have to kill Lonato. It’s horrible. I was angry because of the injustice he suffered, but I was the one to kill him because he wanted justice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You put your duty above your vengeance,” Dimitri noted, and he could hear his father call him a spineless worm right as his stepmother reminded him that he had a duty to avenge them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did. I still can’t say I like Catherine. She acts friendly…she </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> friendly, but she’s also zealous. I would like to believe she has a good heart, but I still don’t want to be around her if I can avoid it.” She paused, thinking. “Hm. I’ll still probably get her something for her birthday though, it’s coming up and that’s just good manners.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri felt a slight smile come to his face at the change in topic. “You’re very kind to keep other’s birthdays in mind so readily. It seems you’re always planning a celebration for one or another.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “It’s a nice thing to do. Things are peaceful right now, so why not celebrate when there’s cause to?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A very good question, professor…Ah, if I may ask, when is your birthday?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s on the twentieth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri blinked. “Of this month?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’ll keep that in mind then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That earned a slight smile. “Thanks. How are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri paused. “...Better, I think.” It wasn’t quite a lie. He wasn’t quite as agitated now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…My problem was resolved because I could talk with Catherine and get to know her. I don’t think that’s possible with Bias.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I doubt it is…” He sighed. “I just…That woman admitted that old man, Solon, raised her. That he was as good as a father to her, and she murdered him. And I know he was an evil man! He abducted Shez and he made it clear he was fine with doing worse, but… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His fists clenched. “...I can’t get that look of betrayal he had out of my mind. He looked…He looked like what I can only imagine a father might look like if it were his own child murdering him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The image of his own father’s body drifted through Dimitri’s mind and he shuddered. “...What could drive a person to do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t know,” Byleth admitted, “She said she hated him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She did. She…She said she thought he killed two people, Thales and Pittacus,” Dimitri recalled, “And…I don’t know. Were they her family? Did she really want vengeance so badly she was willing to murder her own father for it? And then to realize he had nothing to do with it then and there…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think either of us can figure out what her motive was. We can speculate, but unless we get a chance to talk to her again, we won’t know what was really going through her mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Somehow I doubt she'll be willing to speak to us about it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe. We won't know until it happens," Byleth said, as she offered a hand to help him up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose so," Dimitri responded, taking her hand to get up. "Thank you for this talk, Professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It was no problem. Even if you aren't my student, I still want to make sure to help you," Byleth said. "You're a good person, Dimitri. Just remember to ask for help if you need it. At the very least, you can train better if someone's assisting you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll make sure to keep that in mind, Professor. Though for now, I should try to get some rest."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Goodnight, Dimitri." </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"I fail to see the issue," Hubert said as he talked with Edelgard. "The professor has put her full trust in you. Does that not mean she is that much easier to control?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I know, but if we lead her along, then it may end up backfiring on us if she were to learn our association with Bias." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then we simply have to make sure she doesn't find out. As it stands the only ones who could tell her are Bias and Kronya, which means we just have to get rid of them," Hubert noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Letting out a sigh, Edelgard decided to focus on something else. "That is true. Though I can't help but wonder what she's planning… are they going to attempt something with Shez again?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is certainly possible, assuming what Solon said was indeed the truth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If we keep assuming that she is working with them, then we won't get anywhere." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It never hurts to be too cautious," Hubert advised, “But I digress. Kronya has clearly shifted her objective, whatever it may be now. If we can indeed presume Shez truly is someone who is ethnically ‘Agarthan’, yet not a member of Those Who Slither in the Dark, then there lies the question of what her goal is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We assumed that her mission here was to get close to me. Presumably then, her shift in priorities comes at Bias’s order…assuming she is still working with Those Who Slither.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You think she may have defected?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard gave Hubert a flat look. “I think Bias quite literally stabbed her superior in the back. Whatever their goals may be, I think it is safe to assume she was going against orders to do so. Which means it’s not a question of ‘if’ she has defected, but what she plans to do now that she has.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…but do our enemies know that she has defected? If she can remove an obstacle to her in such a way that hides her involvement, such as by murdering him with an enemy’s weapon…though that leaves Kronya as a loose end for her. Unless Kronya was on her side from the beginning…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard sighed. “We don’t know enough about the dynamics between the Agarthans to be sure who is part of which faction, or even what those factions are. We know Thales is dead and Bias seems to want to avenge her sister…how long do you think she can stay here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If the Church was smart, they would already be investigating their staff members to try to root out any other potential infiltrators. If she stays, then the chances of her getting caught rise by the day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Edelgard sighed again, genuinely frustrated. “I thought we finally had a handle on our enemies, yet only now is it obvious I had no real concept of how many moving parts there are in their organization. Presumably Myson and Cleobulus lead opposing factions now that Thales is dead, but whose side is Bias on? And what about Kronya? That knife the professor found had to be hers, but why would she drop it? Did she mean for it to be discovered? She had it on her person, so she intended some use for it down there…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would a person hide a knife up their sleeve?” Hubert asked, rhetorically, “Presumably, our former classmate was looking to perform an assassination while everyone was distracted. Then Solon died and she didn’t carry it out. Though, to be specific, we have no evidence that she carried out any assassination. It is quite interesting that no Agarthans aside from Kronya and Bias survived that operation. And, if our schoolmates are to be believed, Bias played a part in ensuring that was the case. Quite a few of them were horrified at how readily she threw her allies into danger to save herself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Then…could it be that Kronya is the one defecting?” Edelgard suggested, looking thoughtful, “If not for loyalty to Solon, then she could be trying to get away from a superior who doesn’t mind killing her if it will save herself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well we could always ask her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard huffed. “That’s not funny, Hubert.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was just a suggestion,” Hubert responded with a low chuckle. “Regardless, as it stands, our highest priority would be to figure out what exactly Bias is planning.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I think I know what it is. Or at least, I know who she is targeting, even if she herself doesn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you mind explaining that to me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“With everything that has happened, it slipped my mind to tell you, but I discovered the truth of what occurred at the Oghma mountains all those years ago. Or more specifically, who caused it,” Edelgard said, before explaining what their Professor had told her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had to admit, there was something funny about Hubert falling into the near hysterical laughter she had previously fell into.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Claude had to admit, he wasn’t sure why exactly a minor noble from the Empire decided to transfer over to his class, but it was funny seeing her accept Lorenz’s offer for tea with a strained smile. From what he did know of Emily Korsch, the girl was surly, standoffish, aggressive, and probably a sadist. In other words, probably the funniest person Lorenz could try to work his “charms” on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though he seemed to have his work cut out for him since it looked like Emily had no idea what the difference between tea blends were. Or as she called it, leaf water. It was probably the most taken aback he had ever seen the posh noble get, and it wasn’t long before Lorenz declared that it was up to him to teach her about the grandness of tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Well if nothing else, it'll keep Lorenz busy so he'll stop bothering me. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wow, I think that's the first time I've seen a girl say yes to having tea with Lorenz," Hilda noted as she walked by, a bit amused as Emily got dragged off while visibly holding herself back from attacking Lorenz. "Poor girl." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'd feel sorry for her if she wasn't planning something," Claude replied as he turned his attention to Hilda. "Goes from not wanting to get close to anyone, to suddenly trying to be all buddy buddy. Bit obvious, don't you think? It'd be one thing if it was just Shez, but the other day I saw her trying to seem interested in Ignatz’s paintings." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilda giggled. "Well I'm not going to complain if she is trying to get in my good graces. That girl will do anything with the right words." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, that is true." Claude definitely found it hilarious seeing the Imperial noble try to 'charm' her new Alliance classmates, only to end up getting manipulated by them. Or just dragged along with whatever the classmate in question was interested in. “Do you think she’ll try to get a taste for meat to endear herself to Raphael?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pff, you’re a little late on that guess, Claude. I’m pretty sure she prefers meat to begin with from how she started digging into those Gronder skewers last night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude let himself laugh there. “Seriously? Now I really am curious what Lady Emily’s upbringing was like to get her to turn out like this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well as far as I know, she’s just from some small family in the Empire. No real lands or titles to speak of, just a lordship and a manor in Enbarr.” Hilda shrugged. “I’m not about to make guesses on how she was raised, that’s the kind of thing I leave to smarter people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, but it sounds like you have at least</span>
  <em>
    <span> some</span>
  </em>
  <span> insights.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope! You can stick to all that rumor mongering while I do some proper, important things for a young lady of my station.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like go invite Marianne for tea again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilda pouted. “Well how else am I going to get to hang out with her? Though it’s not like I’m even guaranteed to get some time alone with her since her professor came along last time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really?” Claude raised an eyebrow. “So you’ve been having tea parties with Teach?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just the one so far, though I guess I can admit that she’s actually pretty nice. It’s funny, you see her from a distance and she just seems like a scary, if kind of cute, mercenary, then you talk to her and she’s weirdly monotone and inexpressive, but then you talk some more and it turns out she’s actually a sweetheart. It’s hard to believe people call her by a scary name like ‘The Ashen Dragon’ after you hear her chatting about all the cats around the monastery and how she has their breeds and favorite foods memorized.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heck, I can see why Marianne joined her class. I mean, Professor Manuela is nice and all, but she's kind of a mess, and doesn't interact with the students as much as Professor Byleth does. If I were in her shoes, I'd probably join a class with a teacher that makes me feel more comfortable." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, are you saying you wouldn't stick around with me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Depends, the homework Professor Manuela assigned us seems to be a bit much for little old me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure our new classmate would love to help you with that," Claude said with a smirk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I don't think any of the three newbies are gonna be much help in the brains department." Hilda responded with a light giggle. "Emily seems way more focused on getting strong, Shez makes it clear she's not the brains between her and her sister, and Baltie is well… Baltie." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Speaking of, how's Holst doing? Have you written to him about Balthus?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, it was probably the fastest I ever got a letter back once I told him. If he wasn't busy guarding Fodlan's Throat, he probably would have made his way over here right away," Hilda said, sighing at how her brother could be. "He was really tempted to though. Apparently the Almyrans haven't made any move all year, though he says that could mean they might be planning something big." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...They are?" Well, that was worrying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, Holst was surprised too. Though who knows, maybe they'll finally stop attacking." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Somehow I doubt that." Hm…that was odd. The western lords weren't the type to just stop their attacks, not when there was glory to be won. Getting their asses kicked didn’t even stop them, since one would just attack right after another lord was forced back. If the attacks halted completely…did something happen in Almyra? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude got the distinctive feeling something big was going to happen, and he didn't like it. </span>

  <span>"...D-Does the professor look like she's waiting for something?" Bernadetta asked Marianne, whispering as she looked at Byleth. The former mercenary was sitting at her desk, sitting up straight and looking at her students expectantly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe she just wants to make sure we finish our work properly?" Marianne suggested as she glanced at the sheet before them full of questions involving night battle tactics. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If it was that big of a deal, she'd say something," Lindhart said from behind the two as he let out a yawn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… it's weird, I feel like there's something at the tip of my tongue but I don't know what it is…" Caspar muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe we should just ask her?" Flayn asked, though she didn’t want to be the one to do so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why don't we just finish our work for now before assuming things about our professor?" Edelgard cut in. She actually had finished her work already, so really it was everyone else that was the problem. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, but Edie, you have to admit she does look cute like this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You shouldn't make inappropriate comments about our professor, Dorothea," Edelgard complained, getting Dorothea to blink. Though before she could ask what Edelgard’s comment was about, the bell rang, signaling the end of class. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, please make sure to finish the work when you have the time, but you have until the end of class on Monday to finish it, so no rush," Byleth said, as the students began to get up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No worries professor, I have already finished the assignment!" Ferdinand boasted as he handed the paper in. As did a few other students, minus the boasting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you," Byleth said, taking the papers before pausing as she heard the door open. "Dimitri?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry to intrude, Professor, I just came by to deliver something," the blond prince said as he walked up to the teacher and handed her a box. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, thank you Dimitri," Byleth replied as she opened the box, and found a brooch inside that had a blue gem in its center. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Beside her, Edelgard heard Dorothea let out a gasp as she saw the gift, while the Imperial Heiress herself felt her brow furrow. Why did Dimitri suddenly bring the professor a gift? …Was he competition–was he attempting to seduce the professor?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I hope it's to your liking professor, I had asked for some help choosing it from my classmates. On behalf of all the Blue Lions, we wish you a happy birthday." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oh, it was a birthday gift- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That was it!" Caspar suddenly shouted, before running out of the classroom in a hurry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, whoops. Hey, professor,” Linhardt called out, raising a hand, “I forgot it was your birthday. Can I get you a gift tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s okay, Linhardt,” Byleth accepted while taking out the brooch and tilting her head as she tried to figure out where to attach it to her shirt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great, I’ll get it to you then. Or next week. When I remember.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard, meanwhile, couldn’t help but notice her other classmates were being less than calm about obviously forgetting their professor’s birthday, judging by the frenzy of whispering she was hearing. She, however, remained perfectly calm as she pushed herself up from her desk, prompting a glance from Dorothea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Heh, so, Edie, do you happen to have something–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t see why I would,” she muttered, trying to keep her voice low, “I have no obligation to get my teacher a birthday gift.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, so you do have something special planned then~.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why do you say that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well otherwise you would be doing the same thing as Hubie.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard paused, then glanced towards the front and saw Hubert inclining his head towards the professor. “Happy birthday, professor. Congratulations on living for another year.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Hubert.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s good enough?” Edelgard mumbled, before her eyes narrowed, because of course that wasn’t good enough. She may not have an obligation to give a gift to her professor, but she was a princess of Adrestia, she could most definitely give a better gift than just some well-wishes!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea blinked as Edelgard pushed away from the desk and left the classroom, trying to avoid looking hurried as she practically fled the room. “...Hmm…well, no need to comment on that when she’s not around to hear it. Now, what to do for our lovely professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While Dorothea considered her plans for the professor’s birthday and Edelgard continued to not-hurry her way to the markets, the rest of the Eagles scattered across the monastery grounds, some quicker than others, as they tried to figure out what would work as a gift for the professor’s birthday.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the students left the classroom in a hurry, Caspar came running back into the classroom, holding a small box which he handed to Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry about that professor, it completely slipped my mind," the young man apologized.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's okay," Byleth said with a smile as she opened the box, finding a new whetstone in it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hope you like it professor! It probably won't help much with a relic weapon, but I'm sure it'll still be handy!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you Caspar," Byleth said, her smile widening. "I've been meaning to get a new one." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha, nice! Glad I got something good!" he said, before looking around. "Hey, where'd everyone go?" he asked, getting Byleth to shrug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sometime later, as she chatted with Shez while they went to get something to eat, they were approached by Flayn, who seemed to be out of breath as she came running up to them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"P-Professor! H-here you go!" Flayn said, after taking in some deep breaths, and handing her a book of fables. "I hope you like it!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you Flayn, I'll make sure to read it when I have the time," Byleth replied, getting the young girl to smile brightly, happy that her gift worked well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, she seemed like she was in a rush," Shez commented once Flayn scurried away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I think they forgot it was my birthday," Byleth explained as they continued walking, "So they're rushing around." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, wow. Well, this'll be fun," Shez said, smiling too, though her smile was a bit more mischievous. She was perfectly happy to stick by her sister's side so she could see the rest of the students scamper around, desperate to look like they’d remembered. Which went about as well as she expected, since, mid-lunch, Hapi came up to them, and handed Byleth an arithmetic textbook. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Here you go, Chatterbox. It's from Yuri and me,” she said, walking away before Byleth could thank her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...huh. Well, least it's nice?" Shez guessed as Byleth opened the book, and immediately noticed writing in the margins that made it seem like Yuri had the book for some time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Mm. It's the thought that counts." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor!" Bernadetta yelled out to the sisters as she came scampering towards them, only to trip on the way over. The bag she held in her hands flew into the air, only for Byleth to swiftly catch her student, steadying her and grabbing the bag before it could hit the ground. "A-Ah, s-sorry!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's okay," Byleth replied, before looking at the bag in her hand. "Is this for me?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Only if you want it!" Bernadetta said, blushing before she squirmed free of Byleth’s grip and ran away, calling over her shoulder as she went. "I-I hope you enjoy it!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I really need to apologize to her for leaving her in the training grounds that one time," Shez muttered, getting Byleth’s attention as she opened the bag and found some cookies in it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What happened?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, I'll explain later," Shez said, before reaching over to try and grab one of Byleth’s treats, only to pout as Byleth moved the bag away. "Rude." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Leaving the mess hall after finishing their food, the duo were soon approached by Marianne, who kept her eyes down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I-I’m sorry for forgetting your birthday, P-Professor," she murmured as she handed over an owl feather that seemed to have been made into a charm. "I hope t-this makes u-up for it. H-Hilda helped me make it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to apologize, Marianne," Byleth said, taking the charm. "And thank you, it looks lovely." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hm." Bowing to her, Marianne left, seemingly flustered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, someone's really popular," Shez teased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm just glad my students like me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There is much to be liking about you,” Petra noted as she walked up, a book in hand. “Here you are, Professor, I hope you are having much to learn from this.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Looking at the book, Byleth noted that it seemed to be a book about Brigid’s language.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Petra, this is lovely.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am glad you are enjoying my gift. If you need any help with understanding, you must only ask.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There you are my attendant!" Constance said, coming up with a wide smile, being her bright self thanks to there being an overcast sky that day. "I hope you're ready, for I, Constance von Nuvelle, have the greatest present for you!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just to make sure, is this another experiment?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course not! Unless you would prefer helping me with another experiment?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe tomorrow," Byleth said, before Constance led them back to the courtyard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Here we go, this should be the perfect area for it!" Constance declared, smiling as she faced the two sisters. "Now, I hope you are ready for a dazzling Nuvelle performance!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With a flick of her fan, a fireball formed above it, before it went straight up into the air, exploding midair as it formed Constance’s crest. Feeling their eyes widen, both Byleth and Shez watched in awe as Constance began sending more fireballs into the air, each one of them bursting in the air to form different symbols, before ending with the familiar sight of the twin-headed black eagle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And such is the grand magic of House Nuvelle!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Constance, that was amazing!" Shez immediately cheered as Byleth clapped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Very impressive. I'd love to see it again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, well, I hope you're ready for when I perform this again! Next time it won't just be fire-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Constance! What do you think you're doing!?" Seteth yelled out, as he marched up to the trio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A-Ah, well, I was just performing my magic for-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Recklessly firing magic into the air can get people hurt!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry about that Seteth," Byleth apologized in her stead. "Constance just wanted to perform something for my birthday. I should have asked her to do this elsewhere." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, is that so?" Seteth asked, a bit surprised at the news. His gaze seemed to soften for a moment, much to the sisters’ surprise. "...As thanks for saving Flayn, I'll let you off easily. Though don't do something like this without permission." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Of course, my apologies," Constance said, trying not to anger the chamberlain before she hurried off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, that could have ended better," Shez muttered. "Hopefully Constance is up to do that again, cause that was fun." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It would be nice if she did." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There you are, Professor!" Ferdinand shouted, a smile on his face as he came up to them. "I had noticed that your armor looked like it was getting worn out, so I wanted to give you some new oil and wax!" the young noble said with a smile as he handed the gift over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, thank you Ferdinand. That's very thoughtful." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Glad you like it!" Ferdinand smiled once again before bowing to the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Guess that means it's my turn~" Blinking, the two sisters saw Dorothea walking up to the two. "I’m a bit disappointed I didn't get to you earlier, cause Constance already had a performance for you, but I hope you still like mine~" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh? What's that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, well it's not everyday someone gets a personal performance from a songstress of the Mittlefrank Opera Company~ Though you’re free to join in watching if you want Shezzie~” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah… nah, I just remembered I have something to do. Hope you two have fun!” Shez said, smiling at the two as she waved them off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, well that’s not surprising. I knew she didn’t really get opera stuff, but it’s a shame she turned down the offer.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can talk to her later if you want.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pft, no need, Professor. Now come on, let’s go find someplace nice for this!” </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Walking back through the monastery after managing to order and purchase a gift for the professor, Edelgard did her best to not seem like she was looking for Byleth. Sure, she might have paid extra to get the gift made as soon as possible, but it was only to thank the professor for all the help she gave them. Really, it was like a gift from all the Black Eagles and not just her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Such was the reason that she had the pendant bear the mark of the Black Eagles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taking in a deep breath, she put the box into her pocket as she began to look around. From what she could see, everyone else in the class had already given her a gift, which meant her’s was the only one left. Well, aside from Lindhart, but who knows when he’d gift her something. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though… was it odd for her to be the last one? It was a bit late to think so, but being the last one meant she’d likely think of her gift the most. Not that she wanted her to think of her, of course. Really, this gift was just an obligation, since she was the house leader, and Byleth was their professor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pausing as she heard someone singing, Edelgard looked over and saw Dorothea seemingly performing a solo act to their professor. Who was smiling enraptured in her performance. Not that she could blame her, Dorothea was a famous songstress for a reason, and her months away from the opera company did little to nothing when it came to rusting her skill. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seeing the performance come to an end, Edelgard waited, not waiting to interrupt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “So, what did you think, Professor?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was amazing. Even if it was just you by yourself, this was far beyond the play my family saw when I was young.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I was just starting out back then, so of course I'd get better~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You definitely did, I hope I get to hear you sing again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My my, you are quite the flatterer~” Dorothea said, with a teasing grin. “If I didn’t know any better I’d say you were serious when you said you’d take care of me~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard…didn’t quite know how to react to that. The immediate reaction was a strange sense of hurt, but she immediately pushed that down under the obvious reality that she had no context for the conversation Dorothea was referring to. Add in the songstress’s teasing nature and the fact that Edelgard had no cause to even feel hurt in this circumstance, and it made no sense to react poorly to a simple teasing comment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t mind,” Byleth replied, and that gave Edelgard some pause because that was harder to disregard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea sighed though. “Really professor, don’t get a girl’s hopes up–Oh? Oh hello Edie~!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ah, she was noticed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard composed herself and stepped forward, nodding to Dorothea first before facing her professor. “Hello professor. On behalf of the Black Eagles House, I would like to give you a present for your birthday. Thank you for your efforts as an instructor thus far.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with that said, she presented her gift, contained in a velvet-lined case. She held it out to the professor, who took it, and then Edelgard had to fight down any reaction when she saw the bright, happy smile that appeared on her professor’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you very much, Edelgard.” She took the pendant from the box and held it up, staring at the black eagle on the pendant with a small smile before she set the box down and put the pendant on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...As I said, it was a gift from the class as a whole,” Edelgard reiterated while trying to ignore how the pendant sat on Byleth’s chest…and also fighting down a flash of irritation when she noticed her professor had also pinned that stupid brooch Dimitri got her to her shirt. “...And I think it is better to show your affiliation to the class you are actually teaching.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, okay. Should I wear this all the time then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Edelgard grimaced, wondering why that question happened to make her face warm up. “Do what you want with it. It’s your gift.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay. I’ll make sure to wear it then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If that is what you want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Good, then. If that is all, I should be going.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard did not run away from her professor. She kept very composed as she left her professor to her own devices…and tried her best not to sigh when Dorothea said her goodbyes and followed right after her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, a gift from the whole class, hm~?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is what I said, yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One that happens to bear the specific heraldry of House Hresvelg~?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The black eagle on a red background is the symbol of the Black Eagle House. It represents the House at the monastery, not the Imperial Household.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? So that little eagle didn’t happen to have two heads?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard actually paused for a moment there, thinking back to the pendant and wondering, for a second, if she actually did give the professor a pendant with a two-headed eagle on it, which would send the exact wrong signals she wasn’t trying to send at all– “The eagle on the flag is gold, there’s a difference.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm, is everything okay Edie? You’re acting a bit strange today.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There is nothing odd about how I am acting.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, I mean, it’s not like you’ve always gotten flustered before whenever I brought up you and the professor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...As the future Emperor of Adrestria, pursuing any form of relationship with a mercenary would be improper.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, and what about all that stuff about you changing the empire and doing away with the nobility system? I’m pretty sure if there are no nobles, it wouldn’t matter if the emperor got with a mercenary.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am doing that for the betterment of the empire, not to pursue some… flight of fancy,” Edelgard responded, making Dorothea frown</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Edie, come on, you need to tell me what’s up. I can’t help you if I don’t know what’s wrong.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There is nothing up, Dorothea. It is simply the truth of the matter. My dream comes first before all else, and I must devote myself to it until I achieve it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Edie, you really shouldn't lie to yourself like this.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not, thank you for your concern Dorothea, but I am perfectly fine,” Edelgard said, ending the conversation then and there before marching away. This was how things were meant to be: even if her classmates and professor agreed to help her wage war against the church, she would still be the emperor who brought the end to many. Let them find comfort amongst themselves as she carried the burden alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Lady Edelgard, there you are.” Well, maybe not completely alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard smiled slightly as she turned to see Hubert. “Hello Hubert. I was wondering where you were.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should say the same for you. Why did you go running off the marketplace earlier?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Edelgard cleared her throat, her face reddening a little. “I…will admit, I forgot that it was the professor’s birthday. I wanted to keep it in mind, but…well, with everything that happened…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I see. Well, there’s no need to worry, we can simply say my gift is from the both of us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I did manage to commission a–...Your gift?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He nodded. “Yes, I had no plans to originally do so, but after learning of her…contributions to the Empire, I elected to send her a tome of rare magics that was in House Vestra’s possession. I believe it should be adequate for her needs, given her abilities as a mage.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s better than my gift.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert blinked. “Pardon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard didn’t respond, instead stomping off in an aggravated huff because apparently she couldn’t trust anyone in this damn academy.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Well well, I think this is the first time I’ve ever seen you this happy,” Sothis commented as she floated behind Byleth, who was busy placing all her new gifts on her desk, from Caspar’s whetstone to the very pretty black and red tome Hubert had sent her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everything aside from her pendant, of course; Edelgard wanted her to wear it, so she was going to keep it on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Today was really nice,” Byleth said, smiling down at the pendant as she held it up, studying the little eagle on it. Interesting that it had two heads instead of one. Maybe the crafter made a mistake? She kind of liked it though, it gave it a kind of unique look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can tell. You’ve had quite the foolish grin on your face ever since you received that pendant you’re so enamored with.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No need to pout at me, I didn’t say it was a bad thing.” Byleth wasn’t pouting though? “Though you may wish to rethink your promise of wearing it at all times. You wouldn’t want to accidentally crush it while sleeping.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t think I could do that. Could I?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your chest is heavy enough to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked at that, and would have responded if a knock on the door hadn’t caught her attention. She headed over and felt another smile come to her face as she saw three very familiar faces standing on the other side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“SURPRISE!” Shez and Leonie shouted, both of them grinning as Jeralt chuckled. “Happy birthday Byleth!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth giggled, a bright, happy smile on her face at her family’s appearance. “Thank you very much!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she blinked, noticing the stunned looks on Jeralt and Shez’s faces. Even Leonie looked a little surprised. “...Uh…is something wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No, not at all,” Jeralt answered, his smile returning full force as Shez abruptly gave Byleth a big hug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked again as her sister hoisted her up, Shez’s own laughter echoing out as she swung her around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, alright, let her down,” Jeralt requested, “I know it’s a big deal, but you can’t carry her to the party.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I bet I could!” Shez immediately replied, prompting an amused noise from Leonie and a pout from Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let me down.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope~! C’mon, the party’s in town!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Leonie laughed as she saw her friend start carrying her sister off towards town, before glancing up at Jeralt. “So, uh…this might be a weird question, but was that the first time Byleth has ever laughed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is, yeah.” Jeralt sighed fondly as he watched his kids. Shez had a big grin on her face as she still carried her sister along while Byleth wasn’t really resisting, though she did keep poking Shez’s forehead to show her disapproval. “You might’ve noticed, but Byleth has never been that good with emotions. The fact that she’s laughing…well, I guess this place is better for her than I expected.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. Well c’mon captain, we can’t be left behind here!” Leonie insisted, grabbing Jeralt’s wrist and pulling him along.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, alright, don’t tug so hard. I’m an old man here,” he mock-complained, following along as they all headed down to a nice tavern he’d found. Technically, the students weren’t supposed to be going out into the town outside the monastery, but being the knight’s captain had at least some perks to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He did end up in trouble when both Leonie and Byleth wound up completely wasted though, while Shez complained about not being able to drink a drop herself. It was a good thing the next day was an off day as they both ended up nursing a hangover. You never forget your first one, and it definitely seemed neither of the two would as they spent most of the day in their rooms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe he should teach them about moderation when he got the chance… even if it was a lesson he himself didn’t follow. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Byleth’s head hurt. That was the main thing she could think about when she woke up again. Just…absolute agony in her head, and that was even with her deliberately keeping all sources of light covered after she woke up earlier and found that the sun wanted to kill her.</p><p> </p><p>“The sun doesn’t want to kill you, it’s an inanimate ball of hot gas floating in the sky,” Sothis chided, which earned a whine from Byleth as she buried herself further in her den of blankets and pillows, “Ugh, seriously? You know you have to get up at some point.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mnhhghl…” Byleth replied, making a very articulate point about how it was a free day and she had no obligations to get up at all. It wasn’t even a holiday, there was no feast or event, she had zero reason to do anything but skip the day entirely.</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t just ‘skip’ a day! You need to actually get up and do things! You have bodily functions that need to be taken care of!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hhhhhhh…” Byleth responded, complaining that her own body was clearly desiring rest above all other things, and stating that the annoying girl in her head should shut up for a bit.</p><p> </p><p>“You only have yourself to blame, you know. Though, honestly, what was your father thinking, letting you drink so much?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mfh.” Byleth peeked up from her covers, frowning up at Sothis. She didn’t mind that her dad let her try every drink on the menu and she didn’t blame him for having fun either…though she was having a bit of trouble remembering exactly what she did.</p><p> </p><p>Let’s see…went to the tavern with Leonie, Shez, and her dad. Met up with the usual crowd of mercenaries and also Alois, who was there too. She vaguely remembered him making friends with the mercenaries, and…she was pretty sure Victor and Candace actually laughed at his jokes, which probably contributed to them extending the invitation for him to join up if things didn’t work out with the knights.</p><p> </p><p>Alois had been flattered, but insisted he couldn’t, on account of how he had a family to support and his own vows of knighthood. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry to say,” he said, “But I just can’t afford to be a mercenary! Why, my wife would be so angry if I left just like that, I'd be begging for forgiveness so much I'd be a mercy-nary!”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth groaned, the very memory of that stupid joke bringing her actual physical pain in the moment.</p><p> </p><p>“I swear, you’re ridiculous,” Sothis complained, “You’re a grown woman, you can’t just laze around all day in your–”</p><p> </p><p>Then there was a knock at the door and Byleth winced again, before letting out a slow sigh. It was one thing to complain to Sothis, but if someone actually needed her for something, she probably should get up.</p><p> </p><p>So the professor pushed herself up from the bed, ignoring the faint ache in her head as she fumbled for a glass of water at her bedside. She drank, then poured the rest of it over her head in an attempt to wake herself up better. After a moment of shaking the water out from her hair, Byleth finally stood from the bed completely and grabbed her coat. The usual gray one, not the darker one she’d received as a present from the mercs, though she did plan to wear that one when she had the opportunity.</p><p> </p><p>For now though, she pushed her arms through the sleeves, enjoying the faint bit of cozy feeling they provided, before heading over to her door and opening it up.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello?” Byleth rasped. She didn’t expect her voice to sound so rough, but she was tired so it could be excused.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard, on the other side, stared at her. “...”</p><p> </p><p>“...?” Byleth blinked, a little blearily, before covering her mouth as a yawn slipped out. “Mh…Sorry. I drank too much last night. My family wanted to celebrate my birthday and we went to a tavern.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I see.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm. Sorry, I’m not…I’m a little out of it right now. Did you need anything?” She furrowed her brow. “It is a free day today, right? I didn’t miss class?”</p><p> </p><p>“...No, you did not miss class, Professor. I think you should close the door right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” The non-sequitur took a moment for Byleth to parse and she stared at Edelgard in some confusion after her words registered. “...Why? I thought you wanted to talk.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re in a state of undress right now, professor. Please close the door.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth blinked. She glanced down at herself. She promptly shut the door.</p><p> </p><p>On the other side, Edelgard took a deep, calming breath as she tried very hard to forget what she had just seen. She most definitely did not dwell on how adorable her teacher looked with a messy bedhead, nor did she think about the fact that her teacher was still wearing the pendant Edelgard had given her. No, those topics were entirely too innocent for her brain to be focusing on at the moment–And then she shook her head because she was fairly certain that was the exact reverse of what she was intending. </p><p> </p><p>She <em> could </em> dwell on her professor’s messy hair or the fact she still liked her pendant. She could even take note of the fact that her professor also seemed to be wearing a bangle around her wrist that had a golden deer on it. Those were perfectly normal things to think about, rather than the apparent fact that her professor preferred to sleep in very little clothing, or the somewhat interesting revelation that her professor’s favorite colors appeared to be pink and navy blue.</p><p> </p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard decided to leave. Checking up on her professor could come later, when said professor was wearing more clothing.</p><p> </p><p>A few moments after she left, Byleth opened the door, now actually wearing clothes she could go out in public in, before blinking as she saw that no one was there. “Oh.” </p><p> </p><p>Hm, she hoped she didn’t scare her off…</p><hr /><p>“Happy birthday, Dorothea," Byleth greeted a few days later as she handed her student a magical tome. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, thank you professor!" Dorothea replied, smiling as she took the book. "I have to say, this isn't something I usually get as a gift." </p><p> </p><p>"Is it bad?" Byleth asked, frowning. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh no, of course not. People just tend to gift me with jewels and the like," Dorothea explained, thinking about all the nobles hoping to win her favor. "So it's a bit refreshing actually. Speaking of, I see you're still wearing Edie's gift~" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, she did ask me to wear it," Byleth replied as a small frown appeared on her face. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Is everything okay, professor?" </p><p> </p><p>"Is everything okay with Edelgard?" Byleth asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Aw, thinking about another girl on my birthday~?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, sorry," Byleth apologized, a bit of worry in her voice. "I just think she's been avoiding me." </p><p> </p><p>"She has?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, outside of class she hasn't really been talking to me. She even declined having tea together." </p><p> </p><p>"Really? Honestly, what are you thinking Edie…" Dorothea muttered. "Well, while I'm not sure why exactly she's doing this, I can assure you it's nothing against you." </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, Edie is just being a bit stubborn right now," Dorothea said with a sigh. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth frowned. "Do you have any idea how to help her?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…well, it might help if you tell her what you think of her?" </p><p> </p><p>"What I think of her?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes! Like, say, whether you like her or not." </p><p> </p><p>"I do like her, she's my student." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, well, that's not exactly what I meant. Like, have you ever looked at her and felt your heart skip a beat?" </p><p> </p><p>"My heart doesn't beat," Byleth responded with a frown. </p><p> </p><p>Dorothea huffed. “Professor, be serious. I want to know if you have any affections for Edie. Ones that go beyond teacher and student.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth continued to frown, though it was more thoughtful. “...I don’t think I understand the question. She’s my student.”</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea sighed and grumbled something under her breath that Byleth didn’t quite catch. Something about someone being oblivious? “Hm…professor, is there anything in particular you like about Edie?”</p><p> </p><p>“Anything in particular…she’s very smart and determined. When she sets her mind to something, she’s going to do it no matter how difficult the task is. I think that’s admirable.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Not exactly what I meant, professor, though I can agree. Hm…Professor, you might be teasing me when it comes to taking care of me when I grow old, but what if Edie were to ask you that?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked, taking a second to parse that question, before looking at Dorothea with some concern. “Is Edelgard in trouble?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Dorothea placed her hands over her face and sighed again, trying to avoid showing her professor just how incredibly exasperated she was. “...What if Edie offered to take care of you, professor?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think I can work for her until my contract with the church expires. I wouldn’t mind working for her in an official capacity though.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Dorothea dragged her hands down her face, then fixed Byleth with a very direct stare. “Professor, do you have any romantic interest in Edie?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked at the unexpectedly blunt question, then actually considered it. “...I don’t think so. I…huh.” She frowned. “...I…don’t know what romantic affection feels like. I know I love my dad and Shez because they’re my family, and I like all of my students. I’m not sure what it would feel like to be attracted to someone in that way so I don’t know if I could even recognize it.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Well that’s disappointing,” Dorothea commented, pouting.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s not your fault. I’m the one getting silly ideas in my head here.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay. My emotions just work weirdly sometimes. I’m getting better at it.”</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea didn’t really know how to reply to that, especially with how earnest the professor sounded. “Well then, why don’t we save the talk of romance for later then? If Edie’s so unwilling to have your usual teatime, perhaps I could substitute~?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sure, if you want to. You like the sweet-apple and Albinean berry blends, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“That I do! You know, it really is impressive how many things you keep memorized.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged, a little more comfortable now that she was on a more familiar conversation topic. “Part of my job is making sure everyone is happy and healthy, so I just keep the things that make people happy in my mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wonder, does that come from being a mercenary captain’s daughter, or is it just a natural talent?”</p><p> </p><p>As the two made their way towards the gardens and continued their conversation, Byleth did feel her mind drifting back to the earlier topic. What did romantic attraction feel like? And…could she be attracted to her student?</p><p> </p><p>Was that even possible?</p><p> </p><p>...She needed to think about this more.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh great, I can already tell this is going to be a bigger thing than it should be," Sothis muttered, faintly annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>"It's important," Byleth responded, frowning. "I need to take my student's feelings seriously."</p><p> </p><p>"Ugh, I suppose...well at least you don't have anything else to worry about right now."</p><hr /><p>In the middle of the night, a light shuffling could be heard in the library as a certain sage disguised as a priestess poured over several tomes. Beasts though they might be, Bias had to admit the people living freely up here certainly knew a thing or two when it came to magic. Not much; they were still far behind the Agarthans when it came to sorcery and technology, but it was still enough for the sage to begin building new theorems as she studied. </p><p> </p><p>Though, as she read through the tomes she had acquired, her mind drifted to Kronya, and how the little puppy was clearly frightened. She wasn't even trying to be subtle in trying to gain new allies. Nevertheless, it was fun seeing her scramble around, so she would let her live, for now. Not to mention that, with just the right words, Kronya would still prove a valuable source of information on the young, ignorant whelp called Shez. </p><p> </p><p>Chuckling to herself, Bias began to wonder who she should target next. If it wasn't the wayward stray who killed her sister, then it was likely someone else who worked for Cleobulus, though the question of who did the foul deed was still a mystery. One she intended on solving…</p><p> </p><p>The sound of a door opening broke her out of her thoughts. Looking over, she suppressed a scowl at the sight of the purple-haired brat. Schooling herself, she put on a slight smile. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry, but the library–" A purple flash of light cut her off as Bias found herself knocked onto the floor, the student pinning her down as she felt a blade against her neck. </p><p> </p><p>"Explain to me why you killed Solon."</p><p> </p><p>“...” Bias glanced at the blade at her throat, noting the design, then glanced up at the girl pinning her down. Her eyes were fully orange and glowing with a fiery intensity that illuminated the white markings on her face. “...Huh. You don’t have the power of Epimenides…you <em> are </em> Epimenides.”</p><p> </p><p>“An obvious deduction. Answer my question,” the great sage ordered in a very different voice from the stray’s usual tone, pressing the blade closer.</p><p> </p><p>“Solon showed no care for Thales’s death. It meant the possibility of him being the one to murder our leader rose to a level I found unacceptable. And even if he wasn’t, I found his callous attitude warranted his removal from his position,” Bias answered quite readily, still regarding those fiery eyes with more interest than apprehension.</p><p> </p><p>“I see. Who was Pittacus to you?”</p><p> </p><p>That question prompted a frown. “...My twin. We were born together, from the same source.”</p><p> </p><p>“And that is the real reason you killed him then. An emotional reaction to his disregard of your sister’s demise.” Epimenides let the sword fade with an annoyed sigh. “A remarkably volatile reaction for a sage, though I cannot say it is uncharacteristic for those of your position. Fire best lends itself to passion in the old schools of thought…Regardless, your murder of your fellow sage was foolhardy and detrimental to the cause of our people.”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps. I am endeavoring to make up for that unfortunate loss,” she stated, before regarding the great sage with some curiosity, “So what is this, exactly? I can hear from the timbre of your voice that you are not ‘Shez’. The girl’s personality appears to be distinct from your own as well, so you are not simply wearing her flesh.”</p><p> </p><p>“Shez is my vessel,” Epimenides answered, gazing down at her as he stood, “That I exist within her is a strange yet fortunate circumstance, particularly with the coincidence that is her relationship to the Fell Star.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Ah. Her ‘sister’ then.” The idea explained things. Not how the Fell Star could have returned, but it did explain the professor’s stranger qualities.</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides sneered, disgust visible on the face he wore. “Correct. I will not fault my vessel for her ignorance, though it will need to be corrected. A…fraction of myself had been attempting to encourage her down the proper path prior to my awakening, yet she is a willful girl prone to stubbornness. Regardless, the time is not right. The Fell Star has gifted its vessel with powers that would make a direct attack unfeasible in most circumstances. Which means I must either finish her off in one blow, or, should that fail, use the Spell of Zahras." </p><p> </p><p>At his words, Bias stiffened and shuffled back. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, so you do know about it." </p><p> </p><p>"...Solon has mentioned it, but as far as I'm aware he was the only remaining Agarthan who knew the spell." </p><p> </p><p>"What a foolish man he was then, to keep such secrets. A truly unfortunate tendency among those who hold such knowledge," Epimenides remarked almost wistfully, "Even if the spell is forbidden, keeping the knowledge to oneself means it is gone once you perish." </p><p> </p><p>"...Th-There is another you can-" </p><p> </p><p>"You still have your uses, I won't use you for the spell. As for that other one…what is her name?"</p><p> </p><p>"Kronya. She was Thales’s lapdog, and from the newest generation of Agarthans, of the caste Bellatores," Bias explained, not wanting to anger the great sage. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…and who remains from my time?" </p><p> </p><p>She shrugged. “I don’t know. Do the names Cleobulus and Myson mean anything to you?" </p><p> </p><p>"I see…the Agarthan people truly have fallen since I've been gone," Epimenides noted as he sighed.</p><p> </p><p>Bias felt a prickle of offense, but buried it down. "What is your plan, great sage?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm… for now, we must bide our time, so that we may strike when the time is right. Until then, I'll be the one contacting you if need be," he said, before looking at Bias. "And I suppose you want the full truth of what occurred." </p><p> </p><p>"...Who was it?"</p><p> </p><p>"Who else but the Fell Star." </p><p> </p><p>Snarling, Bias felt flames burst from her hands, before Epimenides placed his blade against her throat again. </p><p> </p><p>"Do not attack her. The powers she has are too grand to underestimate. We will have our revenge, but until then, you must wait." Feeling her hands tighten up into fists, Bias made the flames dissipate. "Good. Now, are you in contact with Cleobulus or Myson?" </p><p> </p><p>"I can contact Myson,” she responded, fighting down the rage that came with realizing that bitch of a princess had lied to her. <em> Did she know all along? She had to, that’s why she lied. Everyone’s a fucking liar. </em> “Cleobulus, on the other hand, hasn't attempted to contact us back. It is my belief she has gone rogue." </p><p> </p><p>“Much like you have?” At her flinch, he sighed. “Do not fear so readily, I shall not harm one of my people without due cause.”</p><p> </p><p>“...You have due cause,” she noted, prompting a slight smile from the great sage.</p><p> </p><p>“I do, yet I am a forgiving man. For now, I have need of your aid. Prove yourself and there shall be no need for punishment," Epimenides said as he began to walk away, though he paused after a moment. "Ah, but one last thing." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, great sage?" Bias asked, only to stiffen as he turned his gaze towards her, glaring intently. </p><p> </p><p>"Never harm my vessel again." Leaving without waiting for a response, Epimenides made his way back to his vessel's bedroom. In the silence of the night, he couldn't help but chuckle at the situation. </p><p> </p><p>To think, the vessels of the great sage and of the fell star would end up being raised together as siblings. The cycle of this world was truly a cruel one. </p><p> </p><p>And behind him, watching with eyes filled with a growing hate, remained the sage of flames, who felt an increasing urge to burn it all down.</p>

  <p>
  <span>"Now then, I suppose we should actually fill you in on the details for the Battle of Eagle and Lion," Manuela said as the three professors sat together for a meal, "Though I suppose if I don't, that'll just give my class another edge." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Manuela! Don’t try to sabotage our fellow professor!” Hanneman reprimanded, frowning towards his colleague…before an amused smile crossed his face, “The smarter move is to be open and honest and make sure our newest colleague feels indebted to her wise senior who so generously explained everything. So, on that topic–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh so sabotage is too much, but bribery is just fine?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is not bribery, I am simply doing a favor to my colleague. And if she wants to return that favor–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now it just sounds like you're splitting hairs." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm doing no such thing, now stop interrupting me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy in your-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So what was that about the Battle?" Byleth interrupted, not wanting the two to start arguing again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, right, well for comparison, the Battle will be a mock battle like the one we had at the start of the year. Of course it'll be far above that one in scale and grandeur," Manuela explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"For starters, all the students will be competing, and while us professors will be participating, it is the house leaders who will be taking the role of field commanders," Hanneman elaborated, "To show how far they have come from the start of the year." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Though it should be noted that you can't just focus on protecting the commander. Unlike the mock battle, this one will be using a point system. Every opponent one of your students defeats will be a point, while professors count as five points." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And the house leaders?" Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Five as well, but should the house leader fall, that house will immediately have to withdraw." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So you can't just play it safe and wait for the other two houses to take each other out. It's not fun that way, after all," Manuela added, prompting an eye roll from Hanneman, though he thankfully didn’t decide to argue with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Another thing to keep in mind is that each house will be given an additional squad of soldiers, to better help simulate war while making it so it's not just the students. Though of course, everyone will have blunted weaponry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…” Byleth rubbed her chin, thinking. “And what about positioning?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That was actually determined by random chance," Manuela chimed in. "A map should be delivered to you later showing the field so as to better prepare for the battle, as well as the starting position of all of our classes." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There will also be a prize for the class that performs the best,” Hanneman added, “Though I would like to note that the prize should not be the main goal." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that why your class hasn't been able to win for the past two years?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just to be clear, there's not going to be any mission this month, right?" Byleth cut in before they could start arguing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, no. Aside from your usual lessons, you're free to do as you wish to prepare for the battle with no worry about a mission this month." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, good to know." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now then, do you have any questions?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not really. Ah, though I was hoping to talk to you in private later Manuela," Byleth added, hoping she wouldn't be busy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, I'd be glad to." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please take care not to fall for any scheming Manuela might plan," Hanneman requested, getting her to gasp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I would never dream of scheming up something when my colleague comes looking to me for advice!" Manuela scolded him as Byleth began to tune out the conversation. She did like her colleagues, but at the same time listening to them argue could get a bit annoying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thankfully the argument didn't go on for too long, and Byleth found herself in Manuela’s office. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, what exactly did you need?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How do I know what romantic attraction is like?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...well that's certainly a question to ask. Are you interested in someone?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't think so. I just… someone asked me if I was interested in someone in particular, and I felt… odd not knowing if I was or not. I know I can find someone attractive but… I've never actually felt interested in someone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Letting out a sigh, Manuela leaned back in her chair. "Well this is certainly heavier than I thought it'd be." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to apologize, we all have our own troubles in our own way. Honestly I'm surprised you came to me to ask this question, given my own track record." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It felt… weird wanting to talk about this with Jeralt or any of the mercenaries." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I get that…just to make sure, you were taught about the Pegasus and the Wyverns, correct?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was. Gertrude made sure to teach us." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh that's great, I definitely didn't want to have that conversation," Manuela said, letting out a laugh. "So, I'm assuming you've never dated anyone?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Never stuck around in one place long enough to do so." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose that's the trouble with being a wandering mercenary." Manuela hummed. "Well, for starters, there's nothing wrong about not knowing what you like. Plenty of people spend their whole lives thinking one thing only to realize what they actually like when they're older. Hell, I've met people who are perfectly fine without romance or the like." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It would be easier if I at least knew if I liked something or not…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well take this advice with a grain of salt from someone who’s met plenty of people who don't like her, if you want to know if you like something, you should try to experience it first." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"....So, I should try dating someone?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not right away, but it would help you realize something about yourself. There's only so much one can learn from observing." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…okay.” Byleth nodded. “Thank you for the advice, Manuela.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Anytime, my fellow professor~! I may not be all that lucky in love myself, but my door’s always open if you want to chit chat about matters of the heart~.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded and thanked her fellow professor for her time again before she headed out, still thinking to herself about the strange reality of romantic attraction she was now aware of. Sure, she was used to her sister trying to get involved in her love life before, but it was always something that seemed… distant, and unimportant. Maybe she should take Manuela’s advice… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please don't tell me you're going to just ask the first person you see on a date," Sothis said, her tone already full of exasperation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wasn't going to do that." At least now she wasn't. "At the very least… I should probably ask someone I know, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't ask me that," Sothis complained, before their conversation was interrupted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, there you are!" Glancing over, Byleth could see Dorothea approaching while an exasperated looking Ingrid followed her. "We need your help!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What's wrong?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's nothing, professor," Ingrid got out before Dorothea spoke up again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's not nothing! Some jerk is trying to marry Ingrid! You have to help us, that man's entire fortune is soaked in blood!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Only according to rumors. Rumors which I might add only Dorothea has brought up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, well, we should check out, just to make sure, right?" Byleth asked. "Better safe than sorry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Exactly! Thank you professor! You two wait here, I'll go see if I can find anyone else to help us!" With that, Dorothea sped off, leaving the two behind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Honestly, what is with that girl? We've hardly even talked and she seems so invested already…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Dorothea is like that," Byleth noted as they waited. "She cares easily and… I think marriage is important to her. So I think she wants to be able to help make sure your marriage is good." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose so. Still, I apologize for bothering you professor. You saved me once, and I might end up owing you another depending on how things go." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's no bother. You might not be one of my students, but you're still a student nonetheless. Though if you do want to make it up to me, you can always transfer over so the Blue Lions aren't as strong for the battle." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha, while I will admit it would be interesting to learn from you, I'd rather not leave my classmates floundering," Ingrid joked back as they waited for Dorothea to return. Though Byleth couldn't help but wonder just how difficult it would be to find out stuff about this would-be suitor.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>So it was laughably easy to find out stuff about this guy. It was as if he didn’t even try hiding his illegal activities. Everything from bribery, to threats, to even hiring assassins to deal with rivals. He was almost laughably evil. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, I know I'm the last person you probably want to hear this from, but I think your dad really needs to be more thorough with background checks," Sylvain said as he rode by Ingrid. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ingrid sighed, looking frustrated. “I realize. What gets me though is that it was just so obvious! How can there be a noble this corrupt and still in power!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea tried not to snort. It would go against her image. “I’m sorry to ruin your image of the world, Ingrid, but Adrestian nobles in general do tend to be this bad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And here I was, trying to look past my prejudices…” She sighed again, before tugging slightly at her shirt with an uncomfortable look. “That aside, we probably should have picked a different route to take back to the monastery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What, can’t stand the heat?” Shez teased from her own steed, looking amused by the discomfort the Faerghan members of their little group were displaying as they passed through the Valley of Torment, paradoxically one of the most treacherous yet also safest routes to take up to the monastery, in large part because no bandit group wanted to hang around the volcanic landscape.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just think of this like training! If you can get used to something like this, then wearing armor in hot weather won't be a problem!" Caspar shouted, wiping away his own sweat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have a feeling you two are taking this as revenge for when you had to go up to the kingdom…" Annette muttered, not fairing the best while Mercedes seemed to be doing a bit better after she removed her shawl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have to admit, it is a bit much." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have to say, I always imagined the name ‘Valley of Torment’ was exaggerated. I guess it really isn't," Ashe muttered, as he looked around the volcanic area. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, so what do you want us to do when we get back Ingrid?" Byleth asked, glancing at the blonde student. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Isn't it obvious? We're gonna go kick his ass!" Shez shouted, before Ingrid shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"For now, I think it would be best to send this information to my father. If we were to attack my ‘suitor’ right away, then it'll only end up putting pressure on my father." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But we can probably attack him afterwards," Sylvain said with a wink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"For once I find myself in agreement with you," Dorothea teased.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, I'll take what I can get." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ingrid rolled her eyes. "Ugh, let's just get back to the monastery already." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not so fast, you brats!" shouted a rough voice, catching their attention as they saw a group of bandits in their path. "Hand over the girl!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Does he mean me?" Ingrid asked, already gripping her spear as her pegasus began to flap its wings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, I bet that noble hired them!" Annette shouted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Here to take Ingrid and make sure we can't talk," Dorothea muttered, a sigil already forming as she got ready to cast a spell. Though, before anyone could make a move, Byleth frowned as she stared off into the distance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ingrid, can your steed handle two?" Byleth asked, already getting off her own horse. At her nod, Byleth continued. "Dorothea, get on with her. Their main target will be Ingrid, so we have to make sure she's covered." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, of course!” Dorothea immediately moved to get on the same pegasus as Ingrid, pressing up against the blonde’s back as she settled in. “I hope you don’t mind me being so close~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine with it, just try to keep your focus,” Ingrid replied, before glancing back at Byleth, “Are we just trying to escape them, professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are. You’re their priority, so we need to get you to a safe distance. Sylvain, Annette, Mercedes, and Ashe, all of you stay with Ingrid and eliminate any threats that get close. Shez and Caspar, you’re with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you going to be doing, professor?” Ashe asked, readying his bow as he moved up towards the front of their formation with Sylvain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Killing every other bandit before they can get to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“ALRIGHT! Now that’s a plan I can get behind!” Caspar exclaimed, ready and eager.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds good to me!” Shez agreed, hopping off her own horse and drawing her swords, which did get Byleth to pause in thought for a moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. We should do some mounted combat training after this. At the very least, everyone should be able to fight while riding if necessary.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah yeah, teaching plans later, for now, I’m gonna kill more guys than you,” Shez insisted before hurrying off, shifting into a violet light that moved easily across the lava and reforming in a dropkick to one bandit’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah hey, no fair! That magic stuff is cheating!” Caspar called out as he hurried after her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Are those two really going to be alright?” Mercedes asked, a little worried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine, I’ll keep them safe,” Byleth answered, “Now you five make sure to keep Ingrid safe. Then we can go find and kill the noble that organized this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, professor–No, never mind, we can talk about that later,” Ingrid decided, “Come on everyone! Let’s get back to the monastery!”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Oh, I hope Professor Byleth is okay,” Mercedes said in a worried tone, looking back down the path they’d taken to the monastery. Their group hadn’t had too much trouble getting away from the bandits; Sylvain and Ashe had led things for the most part, with the redhead easily breaking through the clustered bandits while the gray-haired boy shot down those that scattered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Annette and Dorothea had further helped by raining thunder and wind down on anyone coming after Ingrid, while Mercedes herself had made sure to heal any injuries that her classmates may have suffered. Their quick escape did, however, mean they had gotten away far faster than expected and the professor’s team wound up being left behind. Which, yes, was the intention, but it was still concerning, which was why Mercedes had come back to watch the path while Ingrid and the others went ahead to report what happened. Well, most of the others.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t worry too much about the professor,” Dorothea reassured with a smile, patting the blonde on her shoulder, “She has a knack for getting out of tricky situations.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I suppose–Oh, Dorothea, your hat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, yeah.” The songstress chuckled wryly as she patted her bare hair. “It looks like I lost it in all the commotion. It’s a shame, but as cute as it is, it’s just a hat. Besides, I notice someone doesn’t have her usual shawl either.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, I did leave that with my horse…well, I can retrieve it later, I am sure.” She smiled at Dorothea. “Hopefully before Sylvain notices and decides to make any comments.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea blinked, not really expecting a remark like that from the lovely blonde, and then had a brief moment where she tried not to glance at Mercedes’s chest. Judging by the slight, amused smile Mercedes had though, she noticed anyway. “R-Right, well, the professor has Caspie and Shezzie with her anyway, so I’m sure things will be fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You really trust Professor Byleth, huh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well why wouldn't I? Things might have been a bit shaky near the start of the year, but she's proven to be quite the reliable professor~ I mean, I asked her to help out and she agreed with no hesitation. She might be a bit teasing at times, but I definitely can't imagine having another professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sounds quite fun indeed. It makes me wonder how things would be if she was in charge of the Blue Lions," Mercedes mused, "Though I suppose if she was, we'd likely have been the ones going up against the Death Knight." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah yeah, that jerk still has to pay for what he did," Dorothea said with a frown, before noticing Mercedes looking sad. "Uh, everything okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, sorry, I was just getting a bit lost in thought…is the Death Knight really Jeritza?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah? I don't know who else it could have been with how scary that guy can be, not to mention how he disappeared after the Death Knight left as well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"....I see," Mercedes muttered as she frowned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Something you feel like sharing?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just something I can't shake from my head, I think I might know who Jeritza is," Mercedes said, a wistful look on her face. "I think he might be my little brother, Emile." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of all things Mercedes could’ve said, Dorothea wasn’t expecting that. "H-Huh? You're related to him?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not certain, but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems," she explained, "I can't help but wonder how he ended up like this. He used to be so kind and gentle…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah… sorry about what I said." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to apologize. I can understand why you feel that way," Mercedes replied, a gentle smile on her face. "I just hope I get the chance to meet him again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I guess we'll need to find out more about those people who kidnapped Flayn and Shezzie." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It would be a start," Mercedes noted, before she noticed something. "Ah, there they are." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Turning her head, Dorothea could see the trio returning, Byleth at the front while Shez and Caspar followed behind, the two in quite the animated conversation, likely about the battle they had. Behind them a trail of horses followed, one of them having Mercedes' shawl fluttering in the breeze. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there professor!" Dorothea said, grinning as she waved at them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry if we're late, they had a surprising amount of reinforcements," Byleth explained as she dismounted the horse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, it was wild! But we managed to beat up all the bad guys!" Caspar said, giving the two a thumbs up. "I'm still fired up for some more!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No more fighting for today, make sure to get some rest." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, come on professor, you can't tell me you're not still raring to go!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, if it's that big of a deal, I'm up to spar with you Caspar," Shez offered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nice! Looking forward to it!" Grinning, the two made their way into the monastery as Mercedes grabbed her shawl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need for thanks," Byleth replied as she began to lead the horses back to the stables. With nothing better to do, Dorothea followed behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, seems we managed to save the day, huh professor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm glad we could help Ingrid," Byleth said, before pausing, "Ah, I wanted to apologize." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? About what?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The offer I made. I've been thinking about it, and I can understand why it would come off as insincere," Byleth said, before bowing to Dorothea, "Sorry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Huh? Ah…do you mean the one about taking care of me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. I meant it, but I can see why it wasn't a good thing to do," she continued, frowning a bit. "You deserve to be with someone who loves you, and I don't even know if I can love like that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you for helping me realize that Dorothea," Byleth said, looking like she would step away before she remembered something. "Ah." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rummaging around in her coat, Byleth pulled out a hat, before placing it on Dorothea’s head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There you go. I’m glad I could bring this back," she said, a small smile on her face before she walked away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Dorothea stared at her professor as she left, before she reached up and covered her crimson face with her hat. She took a moment to think of the fact that Byleth had been sincere in all those moments with her. She was used to empty words from those who wanted her attention, nobles who wanted her for a short time, to use for fun or even prestige before leaving her alone again. So to know Byleth wasn't teasing….</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She tried to ignore her beating heart and flushed face as she watched her professor walk away. "...H-Hm." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea couldn't help but think of how lucky Edie was that she was a good friend. Otherwise…well, she shouldn’t think about it. It wouldn’t do to tempt herself into stealing her friend’s crush.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"A fishing tournament?" Byleth immediately found herself interested as she looked at Seteth. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, calling it a tournament is perhaps a bit much,” the chamberlain corrected, “After what happened last month, I wanted to do something for Flayn, and she requested a feast full of fish. Once I mentioned this to Rhea, she suggested making it an inter-house competition to help bolster camaraderie and to make it easier on me so I do not have to fish on my own." </p><p> </p><p>"I see. Is it just for the students?" </p><p> </p><p>"In terms of the prize, yes. Though you are free to join if you wish." </p><p> </p><p>"It sounds like fun," Byleth agreed, a faint smile coming to her face. "I'll make sure to participate." </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." With his part said, he glanced down at Byleth, noting that she seemed to be wearing a rather modest sundress at the moment. "I must say, your new sense of fashion has been a welcome change." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, thank you. Dorothea helped me pick it out." </p><p> </p><p>"...She did? I admit, that is a bit of a surprise." </p><p> </p><p>"She's good with fashion," Byleth said with a shrug, "Either way, it feels nice wearing pretty clothes." </p><p> </p><p>"Is that so?" Seteth asked, receiving a nod in return. </p><p> </p><p>"I never really thought of myself as pretty, so I never considered wearing stuff like this. Though as Dorothea said I don't need to care about what others think and should wear what I want." </p><p> </p><p>“I see. Well, I won’t complain about your reasons for wearing such attire. I hope to see you at the fishing tourney. I'll make sure to stop by later, but I need to get some supplies from the marketplace first.” With his piece said, Seteth nodded before turning around and walking away. </p><p> </p><p>As he did, Byleth made her way to the pond, ready and eager to have fun!</p><p> </p><p>“I must say, I never expected a fishing competition to be an event at the Academy,” Lorenz murmured as Byleth passed by, frowning at the fishing line he had, “I can’t say I have much experience with the activity, though my father has expressed some fondness for it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? Huh, wouldn’t expect a big time noble like him to be into something so ‘common’,” Leonie replied, her own pole already ready to go, “Hey, lemme help you with that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? No, I’m sure I can–Leonie, you don’t need to aid me with this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, you helped me out with that heavy lifting, so now I’m paying you back. Besides, the captain showed me how to tie a line to a hook plenty of times, so I know what I’m doing.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth smiled faintly as Lorenz sighed in exasperation before she moved along, idly taking in the sight of so many people gathered at the fishing pond. It seemed like almost every student was there already, along with plenty of the monastery staff and clergy.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, professor, there you are!" Ferdinand greeted her, fishing rod in hand as he stood next to Flayn. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, hi Ferdinand, I didn't know you liked fishing." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I would not say it's part of my repertoire of skills, however I felt it only appropriate to join in to better welcome our new classmate," Ferdinand said with a grin, "I also felt like this would help make up for my blunder with that gauntlet."</p><p> </p><p>"Th-There is no need to do that, Ferdinand," Flayn responded, a bit embarrassed, "I already said it was my fault for messing with that weapon." </p><p> </p><p>"Even so, it's only right as a noble that I make it up to you!" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm. Try not to scare away the fish by being too loud, Ferdinand," Byleth warned, a bit amused as his confidence faltered for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>"I see…Well, I suppose I shall have to show the dignity of a noble and remain as quiet as I can during this tournament," Ferdinand decided with a nod before heading over to cast his line. </p><p> </p><p>"Honestly this is starting to feel bigger than it should be…" Flayn muttered as she followed behind him. </p><p> </p><p>Feeling a smile on her face, Byleth glanced around, seeing how everyone else was doing, glad that the students seemed to be having fun, and were even competing amongst themselves, such as Caspar and Ashe trying their best to catch the biggest fish. Other students, meanwhile, seemed more focused on their excitement for the food to come, like Ingrid and Raphael. </p><p> </p><p>Though she also couldn't help but notice the few students that weren't there. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, professor, can you be helping me?" Petra asked, breaking her out of her thoughts. Glancing over, she saw the young Brigid girl holding the hook for her fishing rod. "I am not used to fishing in such a manner." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, okay, how do you normally fish?" Byleth asked, as she took the rod and hook to tie it for her. </p><p> </p><p>"In Brigid, fishing by spear or net is more common. There are also those with skill that fish with only their hands," Petra explained, "I was attempting to do so, but the fishman said that was not allowed." </p><p> </p><p>"...huh. Now I kind of want to try fishing like that…" Byleth muttered as she finished tying the hook. With a quick glance, she noted how Edelgard and Hubert weren't there, though the two had been busy after class lately so that wasn't a surprise… "Do you know where Dorothea is?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, she said she is not a fan of the smell fish are having." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, really?" Byleth frowned at that. They were going to have tea later so that wasn't good…she’d just have to try to clean up before then. "Thank you for telling me. Did you want some more help fishing?" </p><p> </p><p>"I believe I am good, thank you," Petra said, nodding to her before she walked over to the pond, which got Byleth to notice a different group. </p><p> </p><p>"This is stupid," Emily grumbled as she glared at her fishing lure. </p><p> </p><p>"On that, we are in agreement," Lysithea muttered in response. </p><p> </p><p>"Look, I get it, it's not the funnest thing to do, but come on, it's a competition and I don't want to lose!" Shez shouted, which definitely didn't help their chances since she was just scaring the fish away. A quick glance around showed that Hilda and Claude seemed to be the only Golden Deer not at the pond, which, hm…there could be a few reasons for that, but for now, Byleth had a sister to check in with.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey there you three. Having fun?" </p><p> </p><p>"No," Emily and Lysithea immediately responded, getting Shez to laugh. </p><p> </p><p>"About as much as I can anyways," Shez said with a grin. </p><p> </p><p>"That's good. Are Claude and Hilda not joining?" </p><p> </p><p>"Pinky isn’t a fan of fishing," Emily replied. </p><p> </p><p>"And apparently Claude doesn't see the point in joining the tournament since he can just 'reap the rewards' later," Lysithea added with audible annoyance.</p><p> </p><p>“...Is Claude planning to steal the grand prize?” Byleth asked, concerned, which earned a snort from Shez.</p><p> </p><p>“Nah, he just means he’s going to enjoy the feast once everybody else does the work. Heh, it’s times like this that I remember he’s a noble.” She paused, before glancing at her friends. “Ah, no offense.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would I be offended?” Emily asked, which seemed to take the wind out of Lysithea’s sails as she went from puffing up in indignation to deflating with a faint frown.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, well…indeed, it would be childish to take offense from a simple comment like that.”</p><p> </p><p>"Aren't you a kid?" And she immediately puffed up again at Emily’s comment. </p><p> </p><p>"Come on Em, you know she doesn't like that!" Shez said, speaking up before Lysithea could as she mussed up Emily’s hair. </p><p> </p><p>"Regardless of whether I like or dislike it, it's a simple fact that I am not a child!" Lysithea still complained.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright, fine, just let go of me!" Emily shouted back, trying to push Shez away while the latter had a big grin on her face the entire time. For a brief moment, Byleth wondered if she should stop the pair as they continued roughhousing. That ended as the two went tumbling into the pond, splashing Lysithea with water as they did. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm.” Maybe she should–</p><p> </p><p>“Do not use the divine pulse for a situation like this,” Sothis chided in the back of her mind, “Let the idiots reap what they have sown.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth wouldn’t put it quite like that, but she did feel a little amused at seeing her sister push herself back up while spitting out a fish that had gotten into her mouth. “Blegh! Ugh…huh, does this count as catching one?”</p><p> </p><p>“G-Ghh…Shez, you idiot!” Lysithea snapped, glaring at her ‘apprentice’ while Emily came up a moment later, also with a fish in her mouth, though she seemed to be deliberately holding it there, considering she also had two more fish in her hands. </p><p> </p><p>“Hh! T’ld y’!” she said through the fish in her mouth, before letting the bloodied pike drop onto the shore, “See! Diving in and grabbing the fish works way better!”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. You’d probably be very popular in Brigid,” Byleth noted, which earned a confused blink from Emily.</p><p> </p><p>“I would?" </p><p> </p><p>“Well she’s not with me!” Lysithea snapped, glaring at the brunette, “Do you idiots really have to roughhouse all the time!?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well we don’t <em> have </em> to–” Shez began, before pausing when she noticed a very annoyed fishkeeper standing beside her sister, “Ah…hey, uh, so! Me and Emily caught–”</p><p> </p><p>“Get outta the pond.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yessir.”</p><p> </p><p>And thus, Shez and Emily were banned from the fishing tournament.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah well, guess it wasn’t meant to be,” Shez said, shrugging, before glancing at her still dripping friends. Lysithea was still actively glaring at Emily, who smirked back at her before deliberately shaking her hair out to splash the shorter girl with more water. Which prompted Lysithea to start gathering darkness in her hand and Shez immediately stepped between them at that point. “Ah, hey! No more fighting! C’mon, how about we try out the sauna instead of hanging out here? That’d probably help dry us off at least, it’s hot in there, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“That is not how…ugh, fine, whatever. You still owe me for splashing me!" Lysithea shouted as Shez began to lead the duo away. </p><p> </p><p>Off to the side, Byleth was apologizing to the fishkeeper, who had turned his annoyance towards her. </p><p> </p><p>"As a professor, you really should keep a better eye on the students, especially your sister." </p><p> </p><p>"I know, I'll make sure that she doesn't do that again. Is there any way I can make up for it?" </p><p> </p><p>"Just make sure no one else goes diving in the pond," he grumbled as he walked away. </p><p> </p><p>Silently, Byleth found herself thankful that she wasn't banned from the pond as well. </p><p> </p><p>“Would you have used the divine pulse if you were?” Sothis needled, prompting an immediate nod from Byleth, “...You really are ridiculous sometimes, you know that?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth let out a small huff at that, before moving over to a quiet pair of students where she could fish in peace. Though it was a bit of a surprise to see Ignatz sitting next to Lindhart. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, hello there professor." </p><p> </p><p>"Hello Ignatz, are you having fun?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I wouldn't say that," Ignatz admitted as Byleth sat down next to him. "Though it is very relaxing to be able to space out and appreciate the scenery. I guess that's something Linhardt and I agree on, haha." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth glanced over at Linhardt. "He's asleep." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…" Ignatz blushed at that. "I guess that's egg on my face." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, at least Linhardt doesn't seemed bothered by you," Byleth said, attempting to console him as she tossed her line. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I suppose that's good," Ignatz replied, still visibly embarrassed as he stared back out at the water. "Though I have to say, it's nice that the monastery seems more peaceful. Well, ignoring what happened with Shez and Flayn I mean." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh you know, things don't seem as tense anymore. I might not know everything that happened between the Empire and the Kingdom, but things were certainly tense at the start of the year. And I guess…everyone being able to work together to save Flayn and Shez helped fix that, at least partially anyways." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…yeah, I can see that," Byleth agreed, glancing over to where Shez had walked off. For a brief moment, she thought that maybe joining the academy hadn't been a bad idea. "...So hey, what exactly is the grand prize for this tourney?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah… you know, I never asked," Ignatz admitted with a sheepish grin. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…Well, I guess it doesn't matter," Byleth said, as she felt her lure get pulled, instantly reeling it in and catching the struggling fish. With a small smile, she nodded to herself. Off to a great start already. </p><hr /><p>Sighing to herself, Edelgard looked out over the tourney that seemed to be in full swing with the students enjoying themselves. A part of her was considering joining in, until her gaze landed on Byleth, fishing on the dock. It was certainly…difficult, knowing that the person she held affection for and one of her closest friends were seemingly pursuing one another, yet it was something she had to accept.</p><p> </p><p>If anything, this situation made things easier for her since she could now focus on her own goals. Taking in a deep breath, she turned around, ready to leave. </p><p> </p><p>"Lady Edelgard!" </p><p> </p><p>Or she was, until she heard a familiar voice. Glancing over, she found a certain redhead that she definitely didn’t expect to see approaching her. </p><p> </p><p>"Monica? What are you doing here?" </p><p> </p><p>"Why, to see you of course! My father asked me to deliver a report to you, and I felt it only appropriate to do it in person." Edelgard paused as she realized Monica was speaking in code. </p><p> </p><p>"I see. Well, best to discuss that right away."  She gave her vassal a polite smile. “It will be good for the two of us to catch up as well. You must be busy lately if you’re handling business for your father.”</p><p> </p><p>“I certainly am, but it’s work that I enjoy!” Monica replied with a bright smile, before pouting, “Though it is a shame I couldn’t join you in attending the Academy this year. At least I get to see how lovely you look in the uniform though!”</p><p> </p><p>…Right, that part probably wasn’t code. Unless it was. Hm.</p><p> </p><p>Either way, talking in the middle of the fishing tournament was a poor way to be discreet, so the two moved over to the currently unoccupied tea gardens. Along the way, Edelgard noted Hubert was following, as usual, and had a visible frown on his face once he noticed Monica.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, the tea garden. You know, I only sat out here about twenty-three times when I was attending,” Monica noted with a faint smile upon taking a seat, pulling out a portable tea set to serve tea. “Twenty-one of which were meetings with the Imperial nobles of interest attending at that time who seemed like they could be useful connections, while the remaining two were with Alliance nobles. Aloysius Albany and Siegward Siward, to be exact–”</p><p> </p><p>“Monica, are either of those two relevant to our current discussion?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? Oh, no, I don’t think they are. Ah, do you think they might be, Lady Edelgard?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Edelgard refrained from sighing. “Would you care to make your report now, Monica?”</p><p> </p><p>"Of course!" Grinning, Monica reached into her satchel and brought out a stack of papers which she handed Edelgard. "To begin, my father wanted me to discuss some recent findings in our land which he would graciously like to give to the Imperial House." </p><p> </p><p>Opening the report, Edelgard found the image of an axe greeting her. Not a relic weapon, but a sacred weapon. One bearing the Crest of Seiros based on the image in the corner of the page. </p><p> </p><p>As Monica began to talk about one thing or another to make this seem like official business, Edelgard continued to read the report on what she had found. </p><p> </p><p>While sacred weapons were generally not as powerful, they were no less useful than hero relics. The fact that anyone could use them without health concerns made them highly sought after, especially since if one did have the correct crest, the weapon would resonate with it and heal the wielder. The fact that this was both an axe and a weapon that resonated with the Crest of Seiros was quite the added benefit. </p><p> </p><p>"Good work, Monica," Edelgard idly said, almost missing the pleased noise Monica made at her praise. Focusing on the report, Edelgard flipped to the next page and found a sketch of Lake Teutates. She briefly paused as she noticed the words 'phantom warriors(?)' next to it. Apparently, there was a story in the area that involved some type of test to prove your worth, but since Monica had been alone, she chose to retreat rather than risk herself, per Edelgard’s instructions. </p><p> </p><p>Hm. It definitely seemed worth returning to in the future. The last time Edelgard had heard of “phantom warriors” being involved in something church-related was during the Chalice of Beginnings incident. At that thought, her mind drifted back to that event, and how evident it was that corruption ran rampant in the church. How else could they explain how Aelfric was able to do all he did without notice? </p><p> </p><p>If Rhea had been a better leader, such events would not have happened. Lady Eisner's body would have been buried, thus ensuring her professor never had to deal with the trauma of finding her mother's corpse down there. She also wouldn't have been kidnapped as a result and had to deal with whatever insane ramblings Aelfric had–</p><p> </p><p>"Your highness?" Monica spoke up, breaking her out of her thoughts. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, sorry Monica. Did you say something?" </p><p> </p><p>"I wanted to ask if everything was okay. You haven't had any tea and you're gripping the report rather tightly. You only do such a thing when you have something heavy weighing down on your mind." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, my apologies. Much has happened during my time at the academy," Edelgard responded, grabbing her cup of tea to drink. The bergamot flavor did help calm her down slightly as she tried to push past her thoughts. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, would you care to talk about them? I'm always glad to assist in any way I can, Lady Edelgard!" </p><p> </p><p>"It's nothing Monica. Why don't we just focus on your report? You did come all the way out to the monastery so I would hate to ignore why you came here." </p><p> </p><p>“Oh certainly! Do you have anything specific you would like to ask about?” Monica asked while scooting her chair closer so she could flip the page for Edelgard, “I actually found this page pretty interesting. Sure, it’s just some details on market trends, but you never know what you can find on sale!”</p><p> </p><p>Such as a relic, apparently. Curiously, it was one that wasn’t listed in any official records, according to Monica’s gathered notes, which also included the detail that her father, Baron Ochs, had managed to find the strange pair of gauntlets through an underground market.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard made a mental note to utilize Baron Ochs's black market connections more often, if it could get access to items like this. “Hm. This is a curious marking.”</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t it though? I don’t recognize it, which makes it absolutely fascinating!” Monica said with a bright smile. Understandable, given Edelgard had tasked Monica with investigating crest related matters and the redhead had taken that as a reason to memorize every single crest on record. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm. I do. This is a crest of the apostles,” Edelgard noted, “Chevalier, specifically.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? Oh how amazing, Lady Edelgard! I should have expected you would recognize it on sight!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard cleared her throat. “I know who could use it. He would need to be hired.”</p><p> </p><p>“Understood! I will prepare blackmail at once–”</p><p> </p><p>“No, not like that.” She paused. “The man in question is fairly shameless, so I don’t think that would even work that well. Ah, but leaving that aside, how did your travels go?”</p><p> </p><p>“Very well! I actually visited Duke Gerth recently and he was nice enough to give me a lovely accessory. I’m not sure I can wear it though, it doesn’t seem quite right for me,” Monica continued, turning another page and pointing at another relic. One meant to be worn on the hand, from the look of things, though it wasn’t like the gauntlets from earlier. “Apparently it was found over in Dagda of all places. Perhaps you could find a use for it, your highness?”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps.” It wasn’t likely though. Judging from the crest symbol sketched on the page, it would work with Yuri’s crest, and he wasn’t what Edelgard would consider reliable. Balthus wasn’t either, but he could at least be hired. Maybe Yuri could too, but…Well, at the very least she could keep the relic out of his hands. “Do give my regards to Duke Gerth if you’re in his territory again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Gladly, Lady Edelgard! As a loyal subject, I’m sure he would be very happy to hear from you!”</p><p> </p><p>For a brief moment, Edelgard remembered a point before the school year, where she had an opportunity to speak with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. She recalled quite easily how deeply the man had bowed his head as he choked out an apology for what happened to her siblings. If she’d allowed it, she was certain he would have prostrated himself on the floor for it.</p><p> </p><p>Guilt wasn’t something Edelgard liked to use, but if it could keep someone on her side instead of supporting another insurrection…</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure…Is there anything else of note?" </p><p> </p><p>"Quite, I also found a lovely book and necklace, though I don't think either are for me," Monica continued, as Edelgard turned the page, finding the image of a tome and a gem set into a necklace, both of which had the Crest of Lamine. </p><p> </p><p>Well Jeritza likely wouldn't be able to use the tome, but the gem could be useful to him… though, Mercedes did have the Crest of Lamine… a possible avenue to explore in the future. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, and recently we managed to gain a contract with an Anna, and her connections will definitely be useful in the future." </p><p> </p><p>"I see, good work Monica," Edelgard praised again, getting Monica to beam in response. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, hello there, are you Edie's friend?" Blinking, the two glanced over to see Dorothea approaching. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh my, are you the mystical songstress, Lady Dorothea?" Monica said, getting up and approaching the student. </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, I take it that you're a fan then?" Dorothea asked, a bit amused. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course! There's no girl in the empire who isn't a fan of you! When Lady Edelgard mentioned you were attending the Academy this year, I couldn't help but feel saddened that I wasn't able to wait a year before attending!" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Edie wrote about me?" Dorothea asked as she glanced at Edelgard, who felt a tad embarrassed. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course! Of the ten letters I have received from her since she arrived at the academy she has mentioned you in seven of them!" </p><p> </p><p>And now Edelgard felt all the more embarrassed. </p><p> </p><p>"Really?" It didn't help that Dorothea seemed far more amused now. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, the only people she has mentioned more are Hubert, who was mentioned in each letter, and a Professor Eisner, who was mentioned in nine letters."</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard felt incredibly grateful that Monica was looking away so she couldn't see how flustered she looked. </p><p> </p><p>“Ooo, really? The professor gets mentioned in almost every letter?” Dorothea grinned over at Edelgard. “Should I assume the only one she wasn’t in was from the start of the year, before she arrived?”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard cleared her throat. “Dorothea, Monica, it’s impolite to discuss my mail.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, sorry your highness!” Monica immediately apologized, though she paused when she noticed the hint of pink at Edelgard’s cheeks. </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry Edie~." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, my apologies Lady Dorothea, but you really should refer to Lady Edelgard by her proper title," Monica said, looking away from Edelgard. </p><p> </p><p>"She can refer to me as she wishes, Monica," Edelgard stated, calming down a little. </p><p> </p><p>"And if we're talking about 'proper titles' there's no need to call me 'lady',” Dorothea added, “I'm just a commoner, after all." </p><p> </p><p>"Even so, you're an inspiration!” Monica insisted, “So it's only right that I refer to you as such!" </p><p> </p><p>"Well…I suppose if it means that much to you. Though I would still prefer just being called by my name." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…well, okay then, Dorothea." </p><p> </p><p>"Thanks Monnie~" Dorothea said with a grin, making Monica blush from the nickname. "Glad I could meet one of Edie's friends." </p><p> </p><p>"O-oh, n-no, I would never presume to be Lady Edelgard’s friend! I simply wish to do my best as her vassal!" </p><p> </p><p>"There's no need to call yourself just my vassal Monica. You're a treasured ally," Edelgard praised, instantly making Monica flustered, which amused Dorothea in turn. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, since you're here, would you like to meet Professor Byleth? I'm sure you're curious about how she is in person," Dorothea offered. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, well, I will admit, I am a bit curious," Monica admitted. </p><p> </p><p>"Then I believe she'll still be by the pond if you wish to see her. For now I think I'll return to my room to finish reading this report," Edelgard said, standing up as she finished her tea. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, you don’t want to come with us, Edie?" </p><p> </p><p>"I have official business I need to attend to, so that takes priority." Edelgard explained, before walking away, getting Dorothea to sigh. </p><p> </p><p>"...Ah, Dorothea, if you don't mind me asking, has anything happened to Lady Edelgard recently?” Monica asked, “Nothing in her latest letters have informed me of what could be putting her in such a bad mood." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…well, it might have something to do with our professor." </p><p> </p><p>"What? Has this Professor Eisner been harassing her??" </p><p> </p><p>Dorothea huffed in amusement at the redhead’s scandalized tone. "No, of course not. The problem is that Edie has been avoiding her, mainly because of her feelings." </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me?" Monica paused as she remembered the face Edelgard had after mentioning the professor. "Does Lady Edelgard…?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yup, and for some reason she's acting as if such a thing is impossible." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…" Monica frowned at that. "Her highness has been through much, so that is not a surprise. She is not one to be easy on herself." </p><p> </p><p>"Edie does seem to act like she has the weight of the world on her shoulders." </p><p> </p><p>"That's because she does!" Monica declared, before realizing she’d been a little too enthusiastic, "Ah, I mean, as the future Emperor, there is much she'll need to be ready for, though it often means she has to neglect her own care as a result." </p><p> </p><p>Dorothea sighed. "Yeah, that seems like Edie. Though I have to admit, I'm surprised you seem to be taking this so well. I mean your own crush seems pretty obvious to me~." </p><p> </p><p>"A-Ah, well, just because I've accepted Lady Edelgard might have a crush doesn't mean I've given up! And besides, I still need to make sure that Professor Eisner is worthy!" </p><p> </p><p>"Worthy of what?" Byleth asked as she walked by, getting the two girls to look over…and pause as they saw her carrying four buckets full of fish. </p><p> </p><p>"...Uh, professor, what's with all the fish?" </p><p> </p><p>"A cart broke in front of the entrance to the dining hall, so I had to take the long way around to take this to the kitchen," Byleth explained, before she suddenly realized something, and took a step back. "Sorry about that." </p><p> </p><p>"About what?" </p><p> </p><p>"You don't like the smell of fish, right? We might need to reschedule our tea time later as well since I'll probably smell like this for a bit…" Byleth muttered before she glanced at the redhead. "Do you like how fish smell?" </p><p> </p><p>"Pft- Professor, I don't think most people would have an answer to suddenly being asked that." </p><p> </p><p>"They don't?" Byleth asked, a bit surprised. "I guess I'm just used to it. Though at least I haven't tried catching fish with my mouth."</p><p> </p><p>"..." Monica was aware that the Professor had 'eccentricities' thanks to the letters she had received, but that had been overshadowed by how Edelgard had described her as a confident warrior, a skilled teacher, and a master tactician. Now that she met her in person though, Monica couldn’t help but wonder if Lady Edelgard had been too generous in her descriptions.</p><p> </p><p>No, she shouldn’t doubt her highness! Even if this professor was a complete weirdo, if Lady Edelgard said she was capable, then she was definitely capable!</p><p> </p><p>At the very least, she was certainly a very capable fisher.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. You’re not a student here,” Byleth noted, pulling Monica from her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, my apologies, I haven’t introduced myself!” Monica curtsied, smiling at Lady Edelgard’s favored professor. “My name is Monica von Ochs, heiress of House Ochs. It is nice to meet you, Professor Byleth Eisner.”</p><p> </p><p>"Hi there, did you want to join the academy?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, well while I would love to be in her highness’s class, I already graduated last year." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…is that a problem? Balthus graduated before and he's attending again." </p><p> </p><p>Monica paused. She genuinely considered the idea of joining the academy again, perhaps longer than she should have, before shaking it off. </p><p> </p><p>"My apologies, but I have very important business that I have to do outside of the academy for her highness, so I cannot attend once again." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh." Monica had to admit, she couldn't help but feel a bit bad at how disappointed the Professor sounded. "Well okay, feel free to drop by whenever you want to." </p><p> </p><p>"Believe me, if I could, I would drop by at least once a month. As it stands however, I have to content myself with just receiving letters from her highness." </p><p> </p><p>"I see. Thank you for helping Edelgard." Monica had to admit, it was a bit impressive she was able to bow without dropping any of the fish. "Now if you'll excuse me, I need to take these to the kitchen staff." </p><p> </p><p>With that, she walked past them into the dining hall. </p><p> </p><p>"...I must admit, she is certainly not how I expected her to be." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, that's the professor for you. First impressions are very misleading when it comes to her." Dorothea thought for a moment before wincing. "And I suppose second impressions too, since we completely misunderstood her." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Lady Edelgard has mentioned such in her letters." Granted, in that situation, the ‘second impression’ was the belief that the professor might be working with her enemies, before the next letter let Moinca know she was wrong. Even Lady Edelgard could make mistakes on a rare occasion. Even then, the fact that she admitted it and learned from it just made her all the more impressive!</p><p> </p><p>"So, since the Professor and Edie are going to be busy, did you want me to show you around?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, there's no need to. I completely memorized the layout of Garreg Mach when I was here," Monica said, before continuing at Dorothea’s confused look. "I have a perfect memory, so I can memorize anything. For example, I might have only seen you perform once, but I can fully remember the play you performed in despite it being three years, two months, and five days since I've seen it." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh? So you remember all the details?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course I do! I mean, I didn't get a good seat at the opera house, so I wasn't able to get a good view of the stage, but I remember everything about the performance. The specific play was 'Broken Moon Pearl' and I love your portrayal of Lady Tomar! Two loves split apart by destiny with only a magic pearl being the only connection they had left had me in tears!</p><p> </p><p>"You even managed to improvise expertly when your co-lead forgot his lines! 'Ah, does the goddess take your voice away to punish us?' I don't think there was a dry eye in the crowd that night!"</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea blinked in the face of the redhead’s enthusiasm, then giggled. “Oh my, I didn’t think I’d meet such a huge fan today. It’s a shame you haven’t been able to see more of my shows. I would love to see you in the audience again some time~”</p><p> </p><p>At her words, Monica couldn't help but blush as the songstress teased her. </p><p> </p><p>"W-Well, thank you for the kind words! If I ever have the chance to visit the opera house again, I'll make sure to take it!" </p><p> </p><p>"You could always ask Edie, I'm sure she could get you some tickets easily." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I would hate to impose on her highness like that. Though I'll do my best to visit when you return to the opera house and cheer you on!" </p><p> </p><p>"Is that so? Well, in that case I'll make sure to cheer you on too, though I hope you don't mind that I'm helping Edie with her crush as well." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, of course not. While I will of course want to make sure whoever Lady Edelgard pursues is worthy of her, she is free to love who she wishes, no matter how many they may be!" </p><p> </p><p>"...H-Huh?" Now it was Dorothea’s turn to get flustered. </p><p> </p><p>"While Lady Edelgard isn't one for traditions, it is common for the Emperor to take on several spouses. So if she wishes to follow said tradition then I will ensure to vet any and all potential candidates!" </p><p> </p><p>"...W-Well, you're certainly quite open. Ahem." Dorothea pretended to clear her throat, before giving Monica a little glance. “And, ah…do you happen to be interested in Edie too?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I adore Lady Edelgard! If she allowed me to, I would cherish her for all my days! But if she’s interested in someone else, that’s fine. I just need to make sure they’re good enough for her, and if they’re not, well, I don’t doubt her highness’s judgement, but I will be forced to work with Hubert to deal with a problem like that, so you can understand why it might be annoying.”</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea blinked. “...Do you have a problem with Hubie?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh so many problems, yes. Him, and to a lesser extent Ferdinand, get to be at her side at all times, while I have to content myself with rare visits, as I am just from a barony. While I am glad to be able to help her highness, I can't help but think I'd be able to better help her if I were at her side." </p><p> </p><p>"So…you're jealous of them?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I would not put it like that, but I suppose that is a fair observation," Monica mumbled, "Though her highness has allowed me to join her inner circle, I only wish I could do more for her. Especially after all she has been through." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…yeah, what happened to her family was horrible." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Monica kept quiet, as her mind instantly brought forth memories of the past. Of how angry Edelgard had been when she stood by her 'Uncle'. It was before her father had become Baron;  her own uncle had not yet died in the war that was just then starting, and the false Arundel along with Duke Aegir had called a gala to announce the new crown princess.</p><p> </p><p>Some people might regard it as strange to be blessed with a perfect memory. As far as Monica understood it, memories became hazy over time. Lady Edelgard, for instance, confessed to her at one point that she remembered nothing of her time in Faerghus, given that it had been overwhelmed by her memories of…Well, Monica disliked thinking of that time. She hadn’t experienced it herself, but she remembered the haunted look on her highness’s face with complete clarity.</p><p> </p><p>It was during that gala that Monica noticed things were different with Lord Arundel. The way he spoke, the look in his eyes, how he picked up a wine glass with his right hand instead of his left like he had before when attending a function at her uncle’s castle, a gathering of minor lords that hailed from the western half of Adrestia and hoped to gain further influence through the brother of the emperor’s consort. He was friendlier then. Well-mannered, but not arrogant. Not like the man who had stolen his face and talked so readily and merrily with Duke Aegir right after the demise of most of the imperial family.</p><p> </p><p>It was after his imposter’s death that Monica talked to Lady Edelgard again, mentioned her suspicions, and her highness recognized how useful she could be. And once they really started talking…Well, Monica could admit, in the privacy of her own mind, that it wasn’t long before she had fallen for the future emperor.</p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Monnie, is everything okay?" Dorothea asked, breaking her out of her memory. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, my apologies, it's easy to get lost in the past for me sometimes." </p><p> </p><p>"Right, because of your memory." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, though I am thankful for this memory, especially since it means I can write down all of Lady Edelgard’s exploits in the future. While I'm sure there will be countless plays and stories about her, I want to make sure there is at least one written account that has no embellishments or falsehoods." </p><p> </p><p>"Is that so? Well I'm sure Edie would appreciate that more than the opera I teased her about." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh? Were you planning on writing one for her?" </p><p> </p><p>"I might have made up a couple lines on the spot, but I'm not a playwright by any means. Though I imagine if I was you would want to go over anything I wrote." </p><p> </p><p>"Only to make sure it shines a proper light on Lady Edelgard, though I imagine as one of her closest friends you wouldn't write anything negative about her." </p><p> </p><p>"Edie might be a bit too serious for her own good sometimes, but I can assure you I wouldn't say anything bad about her." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm very glad to hear that! Ah, actually, if you're not busy, do you mind telling me more about her time at the academy? While Lady Edelgard has told me about major events, I want to make sure I don't miss anything." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, since everyone is busy with that fishing tourney, I might as well spend some time with you. I'll do my best to fill in the gaps~" Dorothea agreed with a grin. Though that changed to a confused expression as Byleth walked out of the dining hall. </p><p> </p><p>Specifically she had walked out while carrying several different plates, all filled with different fish dishes. Including a plate balanced upon her head. </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, professor, what are you doing?" </p><p> </p><p>"Taking these dishes to eat." </p><p> </p><p>"All of them?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, half of them are for Flayn." For a small moment, Monica could have sworn she seemed smug there. "She told me I was the best." </p><p> </p><p>With her piece said, Byleth walked off, making sure to give the two a wide berth as she did. Monica had to admit, it was almost impressive how she could easily carry so many plates, as it was far more than she had seen head maids carry. </p><p> </p><p>It also made her wonder if she should start being a tad more eccentric if this was Lady Edelgard’s type…</p><hr /><p>Letting out a satisfied sigh, Shez walked out of the sauna as she stretched her arms. “That felt great!”</p><p> </p><p>"I'll take your word on it," Arval muttered, following behind her as always. </p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, how could you like that torture?” Emily asked, her face still flushed with heat.</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t have to stay if you didn’t like it.” </p><p> </p><p>“As if I would admit defeat.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hmph, so who's the childish one now?” Lysithea snarked, even as her skin remained reddened as well. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re lucky I'm not in the mood to argue,” Emily grumbled. </p><p> </p><p>“Good, now then, since I have no intention of rejoining that fishing tourney, I’m heading to the dining hall for some cake.” </p><p> </p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea immediately stopped in her tracks, before staring straight at Emily, who blinked at the sudden attention. “You don’t know what cake is???”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…” For all her faults, even Emily could recognize when she said something that would blow her cover. “No, I know what it is, it just…slipped my mind because of the heat. I don't have it often." </p><p> </p><p>"You're don't?? Don't tell me you're like Felix…" </p><p> </p><p>"Uh…" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I know what's going on. Emily doesn't really eat the food here often,” Shez explained, “I guess she likes cooking for herself? Either way, she probably doesn't know how to make cakes." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, that," Emily said, thankful that Shez covered for her, "I don't even like them that much." </p><p> </p><p>"What?!" Emily was starting to realize she should have done a bit more effort in trying to keep her cover. "Right, we're fixing this." </p><p> </p><p>"Fixing what?" Emily asked, confused as Lysithea walked away, expecting them to follow. </p><p> </p><p>"Guess we're following her?" Shez said, walking behind Lysithea, getting Emily to huff as she followed her. Soon enough, they arrived at the dining hall, which seemed to be full of people bringing in buckets full of fish. </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, you two wait at a table, I'll have the cake ready soon!" Lysithea ordered as she went into the cooking area. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, might as well get something to eat while we wait," Shez muttered as she looked around the bustling dining hall, before grinning. "Oh, hey Dedue! Are you on cooking duty today?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hello Shez, Emily. No, I'm just making some fish stew for his highness. He felt bad that he wasn't able to participate without accidentally cracking a fishing pole," the giant said as he stirred a pot, before nodding over to the side. "Mercedes is the one on cooking duty." </p><p> </p><p>Glancing over, Shez saw the gentle Lion apparently assisting Lysithea. </p><p> </p><p>"Well alright then, mind if we have some stew?" </p><p> </p><p>"If you would like," Dedue said, before he grabbed some nearby bowls to serve the two. </p><p> </p><p>"Thanks!" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, thanks," Emily muttered as she immediately grabbed her spoon to eat some. "...Dedue Molinaro." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm?" </p><p> </p><p>"If anyone ever insults you again, tell me and I'll stab them for you." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Dedue wasn't sure if that was a compliment or not. </p><p> </p><p>"I think we have underestimated how violent your friend is," Arval muttered, faintly disturbed, though one side of them was also somewhat impressed.</p><p> </p><p>"Emily, I think you can just say it tastes good," Shez muttered while Emily walked away so she could eat the rest of her stew at a table. </p><p> </p><p>Emily mumbled something in return, her mouth full of stew. </p><p> </p><p>"Seriously what kind of food do you eat back home?" Shez asked as she ate, albeit at a slower rate. </p><p> </p><p>"We didn't really eat," Emily managed to get out. "We only had these nutrient things. Flavor wasn't really that important." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…hm, well, I'm glad I helped you eat the food here," Shez said with a grin. She had no idea what a ‘nutrient thing’ was, but eh. Probably some weird vegetable.</p><p> </p><p>"There you go!" Lysithea said, as she suddenly placed a slice of cake in front of Emily, before placing one by Shez as well. "I guarantee this will help you change your mind on cakes!" </p><p> </p><p>"Eh?" Frowning a bit, Emily reached over to get some. </p><p> </p><p>"Don't use the spoon you used for the stew! I brought you the fork for a reason!" </p><p> </p><p>"Jeez, someone's in a bad mood," Emily muttered as she put the spoon down, before grabbing the fork to eat some cake. And her eyes widened as she placed a forkful in her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, Emily, all good there?" Shez asked, a little concerned by the stunned look on her friend’s face.</p><p> </p><p>"...Is this what soft tastes like?"</p><p> </p><p>“...What?”</p><p> </p><p>Emily didn’t answer her. She was too busy shoveling the cake into her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“...I think you converted her, Lysithea.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph! Of course! Everyone should love cake!” Lysithea declared with a smug smile.</p><p> </p><p>"Well it is a good cake," Shez agreed as she ate her own slice, "Makes me wish I could have it everyday." </p><p> </p><p>Lysithea paused as she heard that, feeling her face warm up as she looked away. She let out a quiet huff as she tried to calm herself. </p><p> </p><p><em> Honestly, she could stand to be a little less honest </em>, Lysithea thought to herself. Even if that was something she liked about the silly mercenary.</p>

  <span>"Ah Shez, there you are." Blinking as she heard Lorenz calling out to her, the merc looked up from her book and over to see the noble approaching her and Lysithea as they sat in the gardens. "I've been looking for your sister. Do you perchance know where she may be?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, she went on a mission with Alois and Shamir. Something about Almyran pirates?" Shez answered as she closed the tome she was reading. "Why, what's up?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, that's a shame. I can understand why a task like that would take importance, but I was hoping to recruit her assistance for a mission of my own." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well hey, if you need any help, I'm up for it!" Shez declared, hopping to her feet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wh-Hey! I thought we were studying together!" Lysithea protested, pouting as she got up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"While I would hate to intrude upon you two seeking to better yourselves, I will admit that having your assistance will be quite the boon," Lorenz said with a smile. "You see, there is a land dispute that my father asked me to handle. It seems Acheron has gotten quite big for his britches and wants to push some old claim that could hardly be considered valid at this point." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, that dude," Shez recalled, frowning. "He tried to skip out on paying us once." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, that does sound like him," Lorenz sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Honestly, when will he stop causing problems?" Lysithea huffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, are we going to beat him up then?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, officially my father only asked me to handle the dispute. Though if Archeron seeks to use force, well I suppose it would only be right we respond with force, no?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha, I like the way you think, Lorenz." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you. Now then, I suppose we should ask the rest of our house if they're willing to help." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, it's probably our only option, since By took her class with her, and the Lions are apparently dealing with a gang up over where Sylvain’s territory is." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, if nothing else, that brute Balthus will be useful. He mentioned being indebted to my father, so it's only fair he works it off," Lorenz decided as the trio went to find their classmates. Hopefully they were willing to help.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"So why exactly don't you just get rid of this guy? If he's trying to take your territory then he has to go," Emily stated as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. To be fair, it was a question most of their group was considering as they traveled to the disputed territory.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, Lady Emily. I understand that, coming from Adrestia, you may have very different ideas of how the aristocracy is meant to be treated in the event of a dispute. In Leicester, the nobility is meant to be equal! We cannot simply execute one of our own because of a minor dispute," Lorenz explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Wouldn't it be more convenient if he was dead though?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It would in the short term, but we can't do that without it being more inconvenient down the line," he elaborated, "He is technically in his right to bring up this dispute, so unless he goes too far, the most we can do is drive him off." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, the Alliance would fall apart if they were at each other's throats for every single dispute that happened. Heck, we'd probably already be at five wars already thanks to Claude and Lorenz alone," Balthus said with a bark of laughter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would not go that far,” Lorenz replied with a slight frown, “Claude and I may have our disagreements, but nothing he has said has ever warranted an outright war for the sake of my honor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what about what you’ve said to him?” Leonie asked with some obvious humor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. If my simple criticisms of our house leader were enough to drive him to seek military retribution, then he has clearly shown he is unworthy of any leadership position.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of, where is Claude?” Raphael asked, looking around for the house leader. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Claude and Hilda are helping Professor Byleth, Raphael,” Ignatz explained. “Apparently he was interested in what the Almyrans were up to.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that makes sense,” Raphael said with a big grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, at least he’s finally taking his duties seriously,” Lorenz muttered. “Maybe he’ll finally have something commendable about him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Lorenz, you said we can’t kill that noble guy unless he goes too far, right?” Emily asked, before pointing ahead of them. “Does that count as too far?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Looking ahead, Lorenz paused when he saw the vast amount of soldiers Acheron brought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did the man bring his entire personal force for this?” Lorenz wondered, a bit stupefied. “He truly is a fool.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So is that blond-haired twig the one we have to go after?” Emily asked, spotting Archeron off in the distance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Accurate, and yup,” Shez said, pulling out her swords. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well in that case, I’ll go get him, the rest of you kids can stay here,” Balthus declared, cracking his knuckles as an excited grin spread across his face. “Gotta work off my debt somehow.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t call me a kid!” Lysithea snapped, though her protest was drowned out by Emily’s shout.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, you’re not the only one who’s gonna have some fun!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We are not here to have fun, and I refuse to stay behind while you throw yourself into the heat of battle. I was the one to ask you to come along, so I’ll be the one to handle Archeron!” Lorenz stated, frowning as he stared at the infamous weathervane of a noble in the distance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, guess that means we know who's going on the offensive.” Grinning, Shez glanced over at Leonie. “You’re in charge of defending this location, got it, Leonie?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, I’ll make the captain proud!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you will! And you mind staying with her, Lys? I figure you can keep the fort safe from anyone that gets too close.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph, of course I can,” Lysithea stated, glowering up at her student, “Just get going already!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, come on Ignatz, can’t let them do all the work!” Raphael encouraged with a big grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“R-Right!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine then!” Lorenz decided, “Those of you who wish to press the attack, with me! We’ll seize the drawbridges and cut off the routes his forces can take until we are ready to seize Acheron himself! Remember, we need not kill him! Once his escape is cut off, the coward will most assuredly surrender!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Got it, boss!” Shez said, grinning over at her classmate before quickly charging the first enemy soldier she saw. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the startled axe wielder went down in a spray of blood, Emily huffed in a mix of amusement and annoyance. “Don’t think I’ll let you get ahead of me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, and I thought I could be competitive,” Leonie commented as she watched the brunette jam her saber into a swordsman’s throat and rip it through his neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea huffed in annoyance, prepping a pair of spells as she saw the enemy starting to rally as they realized they were being attacked. “Trust me, you haven’t seen how annoying those two can get when they’re trying to train.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I don’t know, I’ve gone up against Shez a few times so I think I have a good idea of it. For now though…” She decided to pull out her bow and nocked an arrow before sending it flying into an enemy mage’s chest. “Do you feel like keeping count of how many you get?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I see you and Shez share some habits.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not a no.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph! I’ll handle double the enemies you manage to strike down!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m starting to think some of our classmates are way too competitive,” Ignatz commented with some concern as he saw the duo of Shez and Emily get joined by Balthus, who seemed more than eager to crush some bones with his fists.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, they are!” Raphael agreed with a big grin, “Doesn’t it make you wanna get right in there with ‘em?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, that’s not exactly–Oh okay, he’s already heading in…” Ignatz sighed as his friends continued smashing and slicing their way through the enemy before deciding to focus on supporting them where possible. Starting by aiming for an enemy pegasus knight–Who Leonie just shot off her steed and into the river.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! That’s another one for me!” the exuberant redhead called out, echoed by an irritated response from Lysithea and followed by screams of pain as the young mage let loose her frustrations on the enemy in the form of flesh-melting dark magic and swarms of summoned insects.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. I’d say I should join the defensive team, but I don’t think they need the help,” Ignatz muttered to himself, before trying to find something to do as his friends continued decimating the enemy forces.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, across the river, a certain lord named Acheron Lethe Phlegethon was having to rapidly reassess his life choices as he watched his forces getting outright slaughtered by schoolchildren. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING!?” he practically screeched, “THEY’RE JUST SOME ACADEMY BRATS! HOW ARE YOU LOSING?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“OH GODDESS THE BUGS ARE EATING MY EYES!” answered one of his goons, who was having a very bad day.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Acheron cringed at that gruesome response, then shook his head. “R-Right, this can still be salvaged…I haven’t lost yet! I just need to…to…ah, ah ha!” He grinned as he saw two of his men returning from raiding the nearby towns. “Excellent! As long as I can get something out of–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And the one on the left was promptly punched so hard by the blond brute that he flew into and through a nearby tree. “Ah ha! That’s another one for me, Balthus!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, damn, I’m gonna lose my bet at this rate!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...They’re…making bets?!” Acheron asked with genuine offense, before shaking it off. “No, never mind, I still have–WHY IS HE DEAD TOO!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second thief had no answer for the weathervane because he was facedown in the dirt with an arrow sticking out of his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gh–N-No, no, I can still…I can most certainly still salvage–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Acheron.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Acheron screeched, whirling to face the heir of Gloucester as Lorenz leveled a spear at him. “W-Wha–Y-You! What is this supposed to be, hm!? You can’t honestly think a tiny brat like you could possibly kill me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lorenz, who was visibly taller than Acheron, didn’t even bother with a sigh or a frown. “You have no right to be here, Acheron. You can still walk away though and retain some dignity as a noble.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! You have no idea who you’re dealing with! I can easily take down a brat like you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Acheron flung his hand out, casting a fireball that soared past Lorenz completely as the violet-haired noble moved right in and smashed the butt of his spear into the side of Acheron’s head, sending him straight to the ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“AUGH! O-Ow, ow, o-oh goddess, am I bleeding!?” Acheron touched his head, then nearly fainted as he felt a trace of blood there. “Argh! W-W-Wait, wait, I give up! I lose! I surrender! Please don’t kill meeeeeeee!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Lorenz was too dignified to sigh in this situation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily, however, was not, and outright scoffed as she walked up. “We’re seriously sparing this guy after all that? We can’t just push him in the river and claim he drowned?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, Lady Emily, that would still cause more problems than it solves. Even if it would be remarkably satisfying. For now, I need to take this man and go see my father. Good work everyone, I'll make sure you're all well rewarded for your help here," Lorenz said, before hoisting Archeron up to pull him along while the remaining soldiers either surrendered or absconded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hah, speaking of rewards, I'm pretty sure I ended up taking out the most guys," Balthus boasted. "So guess that means I win." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Weren't you just complaining about losing the bet to Raphael?" Shez asked as she glanced at the burly blonde. "How many did you take out, big guy?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, honestly I forgot to keep track, so guess I don't win." As usual, the cheery guy didn't seem that bothered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, not like it mattered. Clearly I was the one who took out the most," Emily stated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You sure? Pretty sure Shez took out more people while you dealt with the stragglers," Leonie teased, getting the minor noble to scowl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, I didn't take out as many, but I did deal with one of the thieves so that has to count for something, right?" Ignatz asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, I can't believe all of you are arguing over something as foolish as this," Lysithea complained with a frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Quite right, there is no need for such squabbling," Lorenz said, before grinning. "Though for the record, taking the enemy commander is worth extra points if we are using the Battle of Eagle and Lion as our point system." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Archeron could only stare in horror as he watched the students bicker amongst themselves about who had 'won'. What kind of monsters had they let into the academy this year…though, maybe he could take this chance to sneak away…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Said attempt was quickly foiled as the orange-haired commoner used the end of her spear to trip him, making him fall and break his nose as he hit the ground. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"AH, I'M BLEEDING AGAIN! GODDESS SAVE ME!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That time Lorenz did let out a sigh, briefly wondering if he should take Emily's suggestion to let him drown. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Some time later after they returned to the monastery, Lorenz happily drank his tea, relaxing after the battle, before his peaceful moment was interrupted as someone sat across from him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there Lorenz, heard you were busy while I was gone," Claude noted, his usual smile on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just a simple land dispute, nothing I couldn't handle," Lorenz responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So you say, but I heard your father also ended up giving you the relic of House Gloucester." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that jealousy I hear in your voice?" Lorenz asked with a smirk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even if I was jealous, it's not like I can use it," Claude shot back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha. Then it’s good that you can acknowledge you can't do everything," he replied as he sipped his tea. "And, well, if nothing else I can commend you for actually helping Professor Eisner against those Almyran pirates." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, those weren't Almyrans. Just some normal bandits calling themselves Almyrans." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really?" Lorenz asked, before sighing as he shook his head. "Honestly, how foolish could those bandits be?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well that's a surprise. Almost thought you wouldn't believe me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wouldn't say I trust you, but I am willing to admit that things would have been a disaster if those bandits went too far. It's one thing to deflect the Almyrans at Fodlan's Throat, but if they had been able to launch a successful strike on Derdriu, well, war would be inevitable," Lorenz assumed, before letting out another sigh. "All while those bandits got away, their pockets lined with stolen riches none the wiser of what their actions caused." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know, that may just be the smartest thing I've heard you say."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, you're quite lucky I'm in a good mood. Now, if you're not going to join me for tea, I ask you to leave me alone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What, not going to ask Emily to another tea party?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shame though it might be, she is not a fan of tea, and prefers coffee instead. She sadly fails to notice the subtle intricacies of a fine brewed cup of tea." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I'm not busy, so might as well keep you company. I did want to discuss some plans for the upcoming battle, and as it turns out, Hilda isn't a fan of planning." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lorenz paused. “And you wish to discuss those plans with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did just say that, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You did. My apologies, your offer simply caught me off guard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, we might argue sometimes, but I know you’re a smart guy, Lorenz. That and I’m pretty sure you learned your lesson about ‘noble duels’ on the battlefield after last time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lorenz faked a cough to try to hide his embarrassment. “Yes, well, I would say there is precedent for nobility to deliberately seek out one on one matches on the battlefield in order to-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are those matches usually interrupted by random mercs wandering in?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Not typically, so you can understand my surprise when it did happen.” He sighed, then his smirk returned to his face. “Though I will note that this time we do have that exact mercenary on our side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That we do. So how about we start off with that?” Claude grinned. “What do you think is the best way to use our mercenary friend?”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Deep in the depths of Garreg Mach, down in the town known simply as Abyss, a certain Imperial Princess was frowning to herself as she read through the “Encyclopedia of Fodlan’s Insects”. The title of the catalog did not match its contents in the slightest, owing to an attempt by the writer to hide what exactly they had written down in its pages: a description of items banned by the Church.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Currently, Edelgard was on the passage regarding a “metal-mold printing machine”, an apparent upgrade in all respects to the woodblock printing presses utilized by publishers across Fodlan. She had known that the church held back technological progress, keeping the people of Fodlan at the level they wished of them, but that information had primarily come from the Agarthans back in her days of being under their thumb. As such, it was only right for her to verify it, and lo and behold, she found the exact evidence she wanted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>More than that though, she felt a growing irritation the more she read. To think, her people could have had so much more. If these advanced printing presses had circulated, wouldn’t the illiteracy among the commonfolk decrease? They would have easier access to books of all types, and to presume they would instead be led astray by “misinformation”...</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She closed the book with an irritated sigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well well, so there really is a princess snooping around us commonfolk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard paused, then let out another annoyed noise as she glanced over at the Abyss’s so-called boss. “Hello Yuri. I thought Constance let you know I was coming.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh she did, I just thought it would be fun to see you for myself. Any reason you’re interested in the ‘forbidden texts’ we have down here?” He grinned. “If you’re looking for the smutty stuff, it’s a shelf over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Thank you for the directions, but that isn’t what I’m looking for.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“More of a fan of ‘insects’ then, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I might be. You’ve read these books then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure have. I imagine you’re the type that lets that sort of thing bother you though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She frowned. “It doesn’t bother you that the church is deliberately curtailing technological development that could aid the people of Fodlan?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It would if I let it, but I don’t, so it doesn’t.” He smirked. “I’m guessing you don’t buy the bits about the potential dangers then, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Even if there were dangers, it should be up to the people of Fodlan if they wish to explore them. It is not the role of the church to keep the masses ignorant for the sake of their own control.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“See, I don’t think you believe that. I think you believe that’s exactly the church’s role. You just don’t like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her frown deepened. “Are you accusing me of something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is there something to accuse you of? Heh, but no, I’m not. I’m just curious where you want to take this. You seem like the type who would start looking into all of these advancements even if they might cause problems. Take the ‘black water’, for instance. What use do you think a liquid that makes toxic gas when burned could have?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Potentially, it could fulfill the same uses that people currently burn alcohol for.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. So, for instance, when soldiers roll a burning cart into an enemy and let it explode. Sounds like the exact kind of weapon the church doesn’t want developed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard grimaced. “...Wouldn’t it see more use in Faerghus regardless? Your people live in very cold areas, Yuri. Wouldn’t something that burns intensely be useful for cold winters? In fact, could it not work well in something akin to a fireplace? As long as there is a siphon like a chimney to vent the smoke through, the toxic gas would not be an issue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Assuming it doesn’t linger and come back down, sure, you might have a point. But can you guarantee it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course I can’t, which is why people should be able to experiment! We are not children in need of guidance!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh really? If people don’t need guidance, then what’s the point of nobles?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“THERE IS NO POINT! All there is are long standing traditions upheld by those in power who refuse to let go of it!” she snapped, before pausing as she saw the interested glint in Yuri’s eyes. “...My apologies, I seem to have gotten carried away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, you’re gonna leave it there? And here I was hoping to hear more. It’s not often I hear from a royal that the entire noble system is pointless.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hmph. I understand that it does have a point, that being a thin veneer of stability. I simply think there are better ways for things to be done.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, sure, I won’t argue that part. I wouldn’t be living in Abyss if I thought the world was fine as it is. I’m just…interested in your politics, let’s say. Especially with how aggressive you got there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned. “Are there going to be issues between us, Yuri?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t think so. So long as you’re not trying to hurt the people of Abyss, I don’t really care about what reforms you’re going to ram through the instant you take the throne. Though try to avoid getting the Church to declare war on you as a heretic, alright? That kind of thing would definitely cause trouble for us down here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. If you desire protection for your people, I would gladly extend a place to them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He paused, then studied the young princess in front of him. “...Huh. You actually mean that. You’re weirdly honest for a royal, you know that? But I digress. Your professor's looking for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked. “She is? Wait, is she down here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure is. I told her I would get you, so we better not keep her waiting, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You are remarkably infuriating.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have been told that on occasion,” he said with a smirk that made him all the more infuriating. Sighing, she followed behind him, and found her professor in the Wilted Rose inn, playing poker. And apparently cleaning house since the people she was playing with were loudly complaining as she took their gold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on, you gotta be cheating!" one of the players shouted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now now, if you can't prove she's cheating, then you'll just seem like a sore loser," Yuri chided as he walked up. "Especially coming from someone who was caught quite easily last week when he tried to cheat." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the reminder of his mistake, the abyss resident let out a huff, before deciding to go get a drink with the gold he had left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Yuri,” Byleth said, getting up before her attention turned to Edelgard. “Hello Edelgard, how are you doing?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine, Professor. Was there something you needed?” At her question, Byleth nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yuri, is there somewhere private Edelgard and I can speak?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I can’t guarantee much in terms of privacy, but the Wilted Rose is an inn if one of the rooms will suffice.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It will,” Byleth said, before nodding to Edelgard to get her to follow. Moments later, they found themselves in a rather sparse room that only had a bed and a small stand next to it. “Sorry for following you down here, I felt we could converse freely down here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What exactly did you need to discuss?” Edelgard asked. Her plan had been to avoid her professor unless needed, but if she was seeking her out like this…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to know if you had any ideas for who the infiltrator might be,” Byleth explained as she leaned against the wall, while Edelgard sat on the bed. “I haven’t had much luck in figuring out who it might be.” Going up to her students and asking if they’d lost a weapon wasn’t working.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, I do. At the very least, I do not believe it to be any of the Black Eagles. I know most of them from before, so I'd notice any changes in their personality, and they have nothing to gain from replacing Dorothea,” Edelgard said, which immediately made Byleth look relieved. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad to hear you say so, I would hate to think one of them had been part of it,” she replied, though she frowned after a moment. “Though, I don’t want to think it was any other student…”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm. Well, for now, why don’t we think of who they would benefit from replacing?” Edelgard suggested, trying to be careful with her words. “It would likely have to be someone noble, so we can probably ignore any commoners, but trying to replace someone of high status would also have its negatives. For starters, it would be harder to pull off, and it would be easier to notice someone of their position acting differently with how many people would know them.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm… that does narrow it down a bit,” Byleth muttered, still not happy to be suspecting the students. “It would help if we knew what those people were doing… and whatever that Flame Emperor was planning.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, the Flame Emperor.” Edelgard tried to keep herself calm. “Hubert mentioned them. Some mysterious individual who could command the Death Knight?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, exactly. The Death Knight referred to them as his ‘master’. I don't know what exactly the Flame Emperor is planning, but even if they don't have the same goals as the people that kidnapped Shez, they seem to be working together," Byleth explained, her frown returning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Suppose you did have a chance to learn," Edelgard said, taking a slight risk. "If the Flame Emperor were to tell you his plans, would you listen?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Byleth's face seemed torn for a moment, her usual muted expression turning conflicted. "...It's hard to say, but I think so, yeah. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I must admit, that is a surprise to hear,” Edelgard admitted, watching her professor’s reactions, “Whoever the Flame Emperor is, he did still aid the people who abducted your sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I know, but I had a conversation with Dimitri, about Bias and why she might have betrayed Solon. He wants to know why, and as an instructor, I need to set a good example, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned. “So you want to know your enemy’s motives?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t know if he’s my enemy yet. He didn’t seem happy with what went on there, and…it’s just a thought, but the first time I saw the Death Knight, he was working with the Western Church. If I assume Solon was telling the truth when he spoke down there, then the Flame Emperor was acting on their own when it came to aiding them with the Death Knight."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you think there are two distinct groups here then. Solon and Bias in one, and the Flame Emperor and the Death Knight in the other.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly. Though I think it’s more accurate to say that the first organization just has Bias as a leader now.” She paused, thinking. “That’s assuming it’s not even bigger than we think. They did have a lot of people helping them in the underground chambers and the dark mages among them seemed to be part of Bias’s group from how they referred to her. She didn’t seem to particularly care for them though…that or she already decided to kill Solon and wanted to get rid of all the potential witnesses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. You don’t think the Flame Emperor could be the one backing them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s definitely the other way around. The way Bias and Solon talked to him was too mocking. They weren’t deferential at all. Especially with how Solon mentioned putting a leash on him." Byleth frowned. "It's…hard to say, but I can't help but wonder if he was someone like Shez."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just…a random thought. It's not that important, especially since I don't have any more information."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you’re saying we don’t have enough evidence either way.” Edelgard was becoming entirely too familiar with that phrase…how could she trust her own decisions if they were being made in ignorance? At least she knew for certain that the Church of Seiros and Those Who Slither in the Dark were, as a whole, still her enemies. The problem came with how uncertain she was of everything else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s true, but we can still speculate. For instance, the Flame Emperor didn’t plan for Shez to be abducted, but he didn’t mention Flayn. Add in how the Death Knight was helping them and I think it’s probable that Flayn was the original target and Solon altered things by going after Shez. I think because of that ‘heritage’ Solon mentioned.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what do you think about that?” Edelgard decided to ask, “About the chance that your adoptive sister may have a connection to these people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t think it matters. Or…I don’t want it to matter. I don’t think it should matter where Shez comes from, but if these people are going to keep coming after her because of it…” Byleth shook her head. “Never mind. I can figure that out later. I had another idea I wanted to bring up. Do you remember Kostas?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard paused, then frowned, trying to look thoughtful rather than alarmed. “...that would be the bandit leader, correct? The one who previously led the Iron Kings.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. He was hired to attack you, Dimitri, and Claude by the Flame Emperor. Solon confirmed it before he died. Or, at least, he said he’d hired a bandit to attack them, and that fits with Kostas attacking you three, which makes me think the Flame Emperor might be after crests specifically. You, Dimitri, and Claude all have crests, right? Seiros for you, and Blaiddyd and Riegan for those two. Add in Cethleann from Flayn…well, I feel like it might be more significant if they were all the crests of the saints or the elites, but I think he might just want the blood of crest wielders in general.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Edelgard considered her response. Byleth was getting dangerously close to something near the truth, even if she was going down the wrong path. “So you think they wanted to capture us instead of kill us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe. It could have been a way to get access to your corpses and get your blood that way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You have quite a morbid mind, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “It helps to keep every idea in mind. Especially if we want to figure out what the Flame Emperor wants… though, I can't help but wonder, are crests that big of a deal?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...People do believe them to be the blessings from the goddess, professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And? The Flame Emperor might want them to get stronger, but aside from being stronger, I don't see why people in general want them so badly," Byleth said, frowning. "I mean, I have a really important crest, but that doesn't make me better than anyone else. I still can't beat Jeralt in a fight, and Catherine was able to win our spar together. Dorothea might not be as skilled in magic as others, but she really only started learning while at the academy. With enough time and practice. I'm sure she could surpass anyone else with reason magic." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, exactly!" Edelgard couldn’t stop the elation she felt at what her professor was saying. "Someone's worth shouldn't be determined just because they have a crest or not! A person's merit should be what determines their value!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I think that might be the most passionate I've seen you been, Edelgard," Byleth noted, making the heiress realize how emotional she had just gotten. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, my apologies, Professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't apologize. I want to hear more about what you think. There's still a lot I don't know about crests, or how people view them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I think I would give a rather skewed view on them," Edelgard admitted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I think most people would. Their views would likely be on the opposite ends from yours, from what I can tell, so I want to hear what you think." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Crests are nothing but a blight on this world. We elevate those who have them, while those who don't are casted to the side," Edelgard said, a frown marring her face. "I'm sure you've noticed how favored you are, Professor. You might have only discovered you had a crest upon coming here, but you were still able to become a professor at a prestigious academy, were given a relic weapon, and seem to have the archbishop’s trust, to the point that she was willing to remove a holy knight from a mission because you expressed a dislike of her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded, though she looked a little…uncomfortable. “Yeah, there is that…Edelgard, how much do you remember of what happened with Aelfric?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I remember what occurred." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"While I won't argue that my crest might have had a hand in some of her decisions, it's not the main reason I think she's like that," Byleth explained, reaching up to place a hand on her chest, her heart as unbeating as ever. "Rhea was the midwife for my mother when I was born. She could only save one of us, and my mother begged her to save me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Oh." What else could she say? She had made another mistake. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I… think she's still hiding something, but I also think she wants to make up for not being able to save my mom,” Byleth continued, “Especially since she apparently saw her as a daughter." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see… I'm sorry professor, I misspoke," Edelgard apologized, looking away from her. Though, her mind couldn't help but focus on the part about Rhea apparently viewing Lady Eisner as a daughter…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's okay, you didn't know," Byleth said, forgiving her, "I've misspoke with you before." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose you have," Edelgard responded, letting out a mirthless chuckle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even so, I'm glad we can speak like this again." Byleth smiled at her. "I was starting to worry you were going to keep avoiding me for the rest of the year." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, my apologies Professor, I had no intention of doing so," Edelgard lied, fully planning on doing exactly that, having only come to talk to Byleth because the professor had come searching for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It feels nice talking with you. I'd hate to not be able to." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...It is pleasant, yes." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'd like to hear more of what you think of crests and the like if you have time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You would?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes. We're friends, aren’t we?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Friends, yes," Edelgard said, counting herself lucky with just that. Even if she was never forgiven for her actions, she still wished they could be friends when the time came. "...There is another thing I want to tell you, about why I view crests like this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tilting her head in curiosity, Byleth waited for her to continue. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you remember what I told you about my siblings? How we were experimented on?" At her nod, Edelgard took in a deep breath. "What they did to us, they wanted to try and endow us with a major crest. Of my siblings, I was one of the few to already have a crest, minor though it was. To them, that wasn't enough, they needed a future Emperor to be peerless. What better way to do that, than to have one who wields a major crest? To that end, they violated our bodies." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clutching onto her arm, Edelgard remembered the nights they would cut her open in their experiments. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It wasn't just my family, many others were experimented on, countless innocents died in their attempt to perfect their process. In the end, I was the only one left, the fruit of all their terrible experiments." Biting her lip, Edelgard began to taste blood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." At the deafening silence, Edelgard found herself unable to look up, to see what expression her professor had. "...Who did this?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure you've heard of it professor, the insurrection, led by Duke Aegir," Edelgard said, scoffing at the thought of the man. "Even now, they have the empire under their thumb, as my father remains powerless to do anything." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay. This won't be the first time I've had to kill a noble, so another six won't matter." At that, Edelgard blinked, before looking up to see Byleth’s face twisted in anger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"P-Professor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't care what reasoning they had, you shouldn't have gone through that. No one should have, so they should pay for it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Laughing in disbelief, Edelgard did her best to compose herself. "As much as I'm loath to admit it, killing them will only cause more problems. They will see their due justice in time, but until then, they'll have to remain." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"....If you say so." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I do. Thank you professor, for believing in me," Edelgard said with a smile. "There is one more thing I want to show you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That is?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My crest, the major one they gave me." Raising a hand, a familiar crest formed above it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The Crest of Flames…" Byleth said, her eyes widening in surprise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, the same one you hold. Though it is not a power I wished for, it is one I shall wield. I swore a silent oath, for the sake of everyone who was lost to grant me this, to make a world where such meaningless sacrifice is never again sanctioned. I will change the world, no matter what it takes." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I see," Byleth said, staring down at the imperial princess, "...You really are admirable, Edelgard. Someone like you really does deserve to lead." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor?" Surprised, Edelgard let the crest dissipate, not expecting her to say that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Back when I was a mercenary, I might have been ready to take the job of leading them from Jeralt, but I was only ever expecting to prioritize them. Even now as a professor, my views on who to take care of don't reach far outside this monastery," Byleth admitted, "And here you are, already wanting to make the world better for everyone else. It makes me wish I could be as determined as you are." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Th-There is no need for flattery professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's not. I said it before, I'm not one for embellishments," Byleth stated, before bowing to her. "I might just be a mercenary, but I vow to help you in your goal of bettering the world." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You have done far more than you think, Professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm glad to hear that." Reaching out, Byleth offered Edelgard a hand to help her off the bed. "Now come on, it's getting late, and no offense to Yuri, but these beds don't seem the best place to sleep." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I suppose so," Edelgard said, before tentatively reaching out to grab her hand, hoping this would be one vow that wouldn't be betrayed.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Huh. You’re going to be going to the empire then?” Shez asked, prompting a nod from her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is my plan, yes. I made a promise to Edelgard and I intend to see it through,” Byleth said as they had lunch together. "I don't know when it'll happen, but I want to help her out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…" Shez glanced across the dining hall towards the three house leaders eating together. "Gotta say, didn't expect you to do something like that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I know, but…I want to help her out. Is that weird?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nah, if you want to do it, go ahead." Shez leaned back as she stared at the ceiling. "Huh, guess that means I'll be hanging out in the empire as well."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You don't have to come along if you don't want to." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if I can leave you alone. Besides, it's not like it's a bad thing. Working for the future Emperor sounds like it could be fun, and I can always travel with the mercs to other nations if I want to go around." Shez couldn't help the sad smile on her face. "Just feeling a bit weird is all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…" Byleth almost took back what she had said but…no, she wanted to help Edelgard, to be at her side… "Sorry…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on now, no need to be sad," Shez comforted as she reached over and patted her sister on the head. “It’s just, I never thought you’d take such a big step on your own like that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m still the older sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Shez smiled as she remembered the young quiet girl who wouldn’t do anything without being told to do so. “You’ve really grown up, By.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I just said I'm the older sister.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pft, that’s not what I meant,” Shez said as she chuckled. “Alright, come on, I need to give Edelgard my blessing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Blessing for what?” Byleth asked, looking confused as Shez got up to walk towards the house leaders. It was pretty rare to see all three of them hanging out, but then they were probably talking about important stuff for the battle thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Edelgard, you have my blessing!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“-I’m telling you–Wait, what blessing?” Edelgard asked, caught off guard by Shez’s sudden declaration. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To marry my sister, of course.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked, before her face went completely red. Thankfully, there was a distraction in the form of Dimitri spitting out his tea, so she could recover from that…thing that just happened. Which was. Hm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…A small part of her decided to keep that in mind in case things didn’t work out between the professor and Dorothea, before the rest of her managed a response. “Thank you.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wait, no, wrong response–</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, why is Dimitri coughing?” Byleth asked as she followed after her sister. Thankfully for Edelgard, it was at enough of a distance that she apparently didn’t hear the previous exchange.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, he just heard something surprisingly interesting,” Claude mentioned with a small smirk, earning an immediate glare from Edelgard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can we just get back to what we were talking about?" Edelgard asked about to eat her vegetable stir fry, before Hubert suddenly appeared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Lady Edelgard, there is something important I feel like we must discuss," Hubert said, even as he glared at Claude. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Very well." Thankful that she had an out, she stood up to leave with Hubert, leaving her tray on the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, didn't think she'd get that flustered." Grinning, Shez couldn't help but note how fast the princess ran away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm," Frowning a bit, Byleth glanced over at Dimitri. "Do you need help Dimitri?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, it's alright, I really should be going," Dimitri said as he stood up with a complicated expression. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, not going to finish your food, your princeliness?" Claude asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wasn't that hungry," he responded as he left in a hurry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well there goes that plan…" Claude muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, well I hope everything is okay," Byleth said, a bit worried, before she glanced down at the trays. "We should return these." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Saying this, she grabbed the forgotten fork to have a bit of the vegetable stir fry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, wait professor-" Claude started before Byleth ate the food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I was just trying to say it's not exactly the best manners to eat someone else's food," he said, trying to keep his poker face up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, okay." Setting the fork down, Byleth grabbed the two trays to return them rather than finish eating them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Everything good there Claude? You look a bit off" Shez noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, everything is okay," Claude said with a smile, trying not to focus on the empty bottle he had in his pocket. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, it wasn't lethal, so maybe it was okay he accidentally poisoned the professor?</span>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Red: Something of an in-between chapter this time, where Byleth and Edelgard have an important talk and we lead up to the Battle! Well, probably. Maybe after the next chapter. There's a lot of lead up, it's a big battle.</p><p>Indi: That there is! A very important promise made, and an important reveal.

Perhaps under normal circumstances, he'd be too cautious to make the attempt, but a certain merc on his side emboldened him?

  <span>Making sure her armor was properly secured, Shez looked over her gear one last time. Two swords, a concoction, and a dagger, though the last item wouldn't be seeing any use during the Battle. Well, probably. She wouldn’t be using it on any classmates, though it was good to have a dagger for utility in general.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Satisfied with her check, Shez nodded to herself and headed out of her room, before letting out a loud yawn as she did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, seems someone didn't get enough sleep," Claude noted, apparently waiting outside of her room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh, I don't know why, I made sure to go to bed early yesterday," Shez replied, rubbing her eyes as she spoke, "Don't know why, but I've been having trouble sleeping lately." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? Any reason in particular, or are you just sleeping weirdly?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, dunno, just been having weird dreams. Like I'm talking with someone, but it's all hazy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well try to keep your mind off that stuff for now, the plan is gonna fall through if you get distracted." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, right, big plan…” Shez yawned again. “Mnh…it’s alright, I’ll be good. Just need to start moving to wake myself up!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, if you say so.” Claude glanced at his friend, taking note of just how tired she seemed as he walked with her. “Does this have anything to do with that guy who claimed to be Tomas?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh…yeah, huh, I guess it could? I didn’t really think it would, but maybe he cast a curse on me or something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think it would’ve gone away when he was killed if that was the case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess? It doesn’t really feel like that though…it’s not like I’m having nightmares, you know? I don’t really feel all that shaken about getting captured, just kind of pissed off.” She huffed, annoyed. “I don’t like anybody making me feel helpless.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think anybody likes feeling like that,” Claude commented, letting a hint of his own bitterness slip into his voice. He didn’t want to get into his past, but it was a way of showing he sympathized so he could afford a little lowering of his guard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but it’s just…it bugs me when I have to be ‘saved’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…so if someone offered you a hand up, you’d slap it away?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, glancing at her friend. “Uh…no, I don’t think so. By’s done that for me, so–Wait, that’s not the same thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You sure? I’m just saying, it’s not a bad thing to rely on your friends,” said the guy who didn’t want to rely on anyone. Claude was aware of his hypocrisy, but hey, being a noble required at least some hypocrisy to function. Besides, if it got his mercenary friend to start relying on him, that was a good thing, wasn’t it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, I get that, it’s good to have comrades and everything like that. I just don’t like the idea of being saved, you know?” She sighed, annoyed. “It’s…there’s a difference between someone helping you and someone saving you, I think. And I don’t like having to be saved.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, I get your point,” he said with a lazy smile, “You’d rather not be the princess in a tower waiting to be saved from the demon.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. You know, that kind of story becomes really funny when you think of how the only princess we know is Edelgard and she could definitely rip apart any demon that tried to grab her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, true! I really can’t see her ever being helpless…though did you know she’s scared of rats?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then glanced at a grinning Claude. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really, Leonie mentioned it to me. Not what you’d expect, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah huh. That’s actually kind of cute. Guess she is a noble girl at heart, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Careful there, she’d probably knock you out if she heard you call her cute. That or Hubert would just poison you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I’ll be fine. Byleth’s their teacher so I’m off limits!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude laughed at the smug look on his friend’s face, before lightly shoving her shoulder. “Alright, c’mon, let’s be serious. And no comments about how it’s hypocritical for me of all people to be saying that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez simply kept her mouth closed, though she was still smiling as she walked along with her friend, her earlier exhaustion fading as they went to join the other Golden Deer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, just want to double check before we meet up with everyone, you're good with underhanded tactics, right?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, sure, dad says that stuff is good in a fight and all. Why are you asking?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just wanted to make sure," Claude responded before they came into view of the Golden Deer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, there they are!” Raphael called out when he saw them, waving with a big smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, finally. I had to get up early for this, you know? You could at least be here on time,” Hilda complained, prompting a raised eyebrow from Leonie.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I had to wake you up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know! Which is why I got up early!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could we please maintain some household discipline for once?” Lorenz requested, something Lysithea nodded to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Honestly, you’re all so childish!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah I’m not gonna take that from the class runt,” Emily snarked, immediately earning an offended glare from Lysithea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How dare you! You’re not even that much taller than me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m a good ten centimeters taller than you, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not actually that tall,” Shez noted, prompting glares from both her friends. “What? It’s not. You’re shorter than Edelgard, Em.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily paused in thought, her frown deepening the more she considered that point.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…does height really matter all that much?” Ignatz asked, before flinching when Emily glared straight at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, c’mon people, let’s get serious,” Claude said, catching everyone’s attention, “And please save all comments for how I shouldn’t be the one saying that for afterward, alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilda, Lorenz, and Lysithea all closed their mouths.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great! Okay, so, good news people! We’re not the most screwed out of the three Houses on the field today! That honor’s going to the Blue Lions, and we actually have a decent shot at winning this because of it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought you were going to be serious,” Lorenz commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am! This is my serious face.” Claude pointed to his own very serious face. “Right now, we have a number’s advantage on the Lions, but the Eagles have a number’s advantage on us. Adding into that, the Lions have more relics than we do. The fact that we have one is pretty nice, everybody thank Lorenz for that–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Lorenz!” Hilda chirped, prompting a blink from the violet-haired noble.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, you are very welcome Hilda–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Back on topic, people!” Claude ordered, despite branching off topic to begin with, “What I’m saying is that we have a great chance of winning this time around, especially since Lorenz and I came up with what I think is a pretty solid plan for handling our enemies. It takes a bit of subterfuge, which took a while to get Lorenz to agree to, but if we play our cards right here, it’ll be the Deer taking the win from the Eagles and Lions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, then what are we waiting for?” Shez asked with a big, eager grin on her face, “Let’s get to it!”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The march towards Gronder Field wasn’t a particularly lively one for the students of the Blue Lions House. As a whole, morale seemed to be fairly low among the folks from Faerghus, particularly seeing as they all felt the absence of one of their classmates all the more keenly now that she was going to be fighting against them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is everyone going to be moping for this entire march?” Felix complained after a long stretch of silence, “If so, you all might as well just go back to the monastery now and let me handle the battle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I was wondering when we might hear from you, Felix,” Sylvain commented, “You never did do well with too much quiet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shut up, Sylvain,” Felix said as he scowled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"While I wouldn't put it like Felix did, I will admit it's important to keep morale up," Dimitri said, putting on a smile. "We might have a lot of work ahead of us, but that doesn't mean we can simply give up before we start." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And while we may not have the numerical advantage, that doesn't mean we don't have our own advantages," Ingrid added in. "Neither the Golden Deer or the Black Eagles will have aerial combatants aside from that von Nuvelle girl, who might not be the most reliable with how she is out in the sun." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Which means we'll need to make sure you stay up there, Ingrid. Can't let our ace in the hole get taken out easily," Sylvain said, smirking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not like they'll be able to. The only archer that team has is that Varley girl," Felix muttered, not expecting her to be much help. Even if he did want to know how she was able to disarm him that one time… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Though we should make sure not to underestimate them. Professor Byleth does seem to be able to come up with plans quite easily," Mercedes noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But as long as we make sure to take out Edelgard, the professor won't be a problem," Ashe added. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah! The other houses won't know what hit them!" Annette said, pumping her arms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just make sure to be careful. Mock battle or not, it would be unfortunate for anyone to get injured," Dedue mentioned as he followed close behind Dimitri. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, that is true," Dimitri agreed, before he looked around at his classmates. "Even so, I'm relying on all of you so we can win. Let's make sure to show everyone what the Blue Lions are made of!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At his rally, the Lions cheered, or in Felix's case, let out a semi-amused huff, before they continued their march to Gronder. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>As she returned from her pre-battle discussion with the other professors, Byleth took the moment to survey the battlefield. While the map of Gronder was detailed, getting an actual view of the field was always a positive. In a sense, there were both positives and negatives to her class's position. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The river meant that the other classes wouldn't be able to easily approach them, but it also meant that her class was also limited in terms of approach. Not to mention it was deeper than it appeared, so trying to cross it would be difficult. With only two bridges, it was fairly obvious where they would be heading once the battle started. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hm… maybe she should see if anyone was interested in learning to use flying mounts, or if they could learn warp magic…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, I trust the discussion with the other teachers went well?" Edelgard asked once Byleth arrived where her class was waiting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, it was nothing major, just wanted to make sure we all understood the rules," Byleth answered, before she felt a sudden wave of nausea hit her. Stumbling a bit, she managed to right herself as she placed a hand over her mouth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, are you okay?" Edelgard asked, almost reaching over to grab Byleth when she noted how pale she seemed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm okay, probably just had some bad breakfast." Byleth responded as she drank some water from her canteen before glancing at her students, as well as the assembled soldiers that they were given for this battle. "Are you all ready?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course we are Professor!" Caspar immediately responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There's no way we'll lose!" Flayn stated, smiling as she did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I simply wish to not drag you all down to my level…" Constance mumbled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As ready as I'll ever be," Hapi added. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We’re all more than ready, professor!” Ferdinand declared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-Is it too late for me to go home?” Bernadetta asked, completely contradicting him, though Marianne did give her a reassuring pat on the shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, I’m sure we can do this…I hope….maybe…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am most ready, professor!” Petra declared while Linhardt sighed next to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I really should have argued that I should sit this one out…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, if everyone is really ready, then why don’t you give us a speech, Edie?” Dorothea requested with a smile, “I’m sure that will raise morale!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A fantastic idea Dorothea!” Ferdinand said, not noticing how Dorothea’s smile fell at his agreement, “It is only natural that our future Emperor give us all a rousing speech to start the day!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard sighed under the onslaught of enthusiasm. “Very well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stepped to the side, letting Edelgard take “center stage”, as it were. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We've been through plenty this year, but I would not have been able to do it without your help. The banner of the Black Eagles does not just represent the empire, but all of you as well." Edelgard said, as she looked at all her classmates. "Today, we will face whatever our opponents throw at us head on, and achieve victory together! Now let's go, and make ourselves proud!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her speech prompted cheers from the more exuberant of her classmates and some of the gathered soldiers, and even the less enthusiastic of the eagles at least cracked some smiles at their leader’s speech. Aside from Ferdinand, who just looked thoughtful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…it could have been longer,” he commented, prompting a sigh from Dorothea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ferdie, the battle starts in ten minutes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still!”</span>

  <span>“Another year, another battle,” Seteth commented from his place atop the cliff overlooking Gronder Field. Beside him stood Rhea, and on her opposite side stood an unexpected face. “I didn’t think you would be joining us, Captain Jeralt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh. Both my kids are participating, so I might as well watch,” the grizzled captain replied, before glancing at the standard bearer behind him, “You got that flag alright? I could hold it instead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? O-Oh, no, I’m fine. Thank you for the offer though, sir,” the cavalier replied, prompting an amused noise from Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jeralt, you are the captain of the knights,” she reminded, “You should not be trying to take up your subordinate’s tasks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d argue that me being the captain is a great reason to take up the jobs people don’t want,” he replied, “I’m not really leading well if I’m not willing to help out, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-It’s fine, captain! Really, it’s an honor to be holding up the church’s flag like this!” the cavalier insisted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, if you say so.” Jeralt shrugged, before glancing at Rhea. “So, do you usually just stand up at the cliff here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do, yes. It is a good vantage point for watching the battle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, but I mean do you usually stand here the whole time? You don’t bring out any chairs?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re the captain of the knights,” Rhea repeated, still clearly amused, “You can stand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine, but I’m going to complain the whole time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really now? Whatever happened to that stoic and stalwart young man that was always so serious when he stood by my side?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He grew up, Rhea. It happens.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea sighed, a little fondly. “It always does, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, beside them, Seteth was side-eying all of that as he started wondering if Rhea was being completely honest with him about Jeralt being “just a friend”. Though, no, Jeralt had been married to Rhea’s daughter, he wouldn’t be flirting with her…though, Seteth didn’t really know Jeralt that well…and maybe he had a type?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His thoughts on the matter would have to wait as some of the knights at their side began to play on their trumpets. Composing himself, Seteth looked out over the field, watching all the students and the soldiers ready for the battle. He looked over at the standard bearer, before nodding. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is time." With that, the flag was raised and immediately they heard the rallying cries as the students charged forward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Battle of Eagle and Lion had begun. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Charging through the forest, Shez kept a toothy grin on her face as she led the squad that was an integral part of Claude's plan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez, hold on, you're not supposed to strike out on your own!" Or she would be, if Lorenz hadn't volunteered to 'lead' the squad first. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on, Lorenz, you're on a horse! If you can't keep up, that's on you!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And what about the rest of us?!" Lysithea shouted, doing her best to keep up from the back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, need someone to carry you?" Emily teased, getting Lysithea to scowl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, come on now, we can save the fighting against each other for after we win!" Balthus said, rounding out their squad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There will be no such thing!" Lorenz shouted back, frowning as he held Thyrsus in one hand. "Now keep your wits about you-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Be it by his own skill or the relic weapon he held, Lorenz was able to raise a barrier in time to block a Thoron spell aimed straight at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, I was hoping to even the playing field a bit." Came the ever melodic voice of Dorothea, almost making them miss the sound of a familiar whip sword cutting through the air until Balthus deflected it, getting a slight cut on his forearm where his gauntlets did not fully protect him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, this is a bigger challenge than I thought we'd face right away," Byleth said as she, Caspar, and Dorothea walked out from behind the trees. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It doesn't matter how many there are, we'll take them all out!" Caspar said, gripping his axe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, it seems Lady Edelgard is underestimating the Golden Deer if she thinks you three are enough to face us," Lorenz said, keeping a barrier up. "Even if she wields the Sword of the Creator, the Professor isn't the only one with a Relic!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You hear that Professor? Lorenz is getting quite the big head. Though here I was thinking all nobles were good with math," Dorothea mocked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A slight rustling in the trees above them was the only warning Emily got as she swung her saber above her, catching Petra’s blade as the Brigid girl attempted a sneak attack, before jumping away as it failed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Emily! It is good to be seeing you again!” Petra called out with a smile, holding her sword at the ready.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, likewise! Outta that bunch of pricks, you were almost tolerable,” Emily replied, grinning too, “That and I always did want to see what you were made of~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, this is your taunting, yes? Then I will be looking forward to the spilling of your guts as well!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s more of a threat than a taunt, Petra,” Dorothea commented before calling down another bolt at Lorenz, who deflected it with his staff and tried to return with a wave of magic arrows.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” Byleth made a mental note to talk to Lorenz about his use of the relic afterwards, noting that he seemed unused to wielding a staff instead of a lance, while also catching her sister’s swords with her own as Shez went straight for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, don’t tell me you’re getting distracted on the battlefield, By! Who was it that always told me to pay attention to my surroundings?” her sister teased, pushing down with her pair of blades. Before she blinked at how pale her sister looked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The same person who told you not to start chatting with the enemy mid-battle,” Byleth reminded, before shoving forward to knock Shez back and bringing her sword up to catch a ball of darkness that nearly collided with her. “Good use of distraction though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, thanks!” Shez replied, beaming, before swiftly moving between Byleth and Lysithea, blocking the professor off from targeting the group’s caster.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph.” Lysithea frowned, trying to find a good angle of attack, then taking note of Balthus getting into a fight with Caspar. He’d already knocked away the smaller boy’s axe and the two were exchanging blows with their fists, so maybe she should back him up–Then she noticed a plume of smoke rising in the distance. “What in the world!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? My word, is that–” Lorenz was about to ask, staring at the clear flames on the other side of the trees, before he grunted as a returning volley of Sagittae collided with his chest and sent him crashing to the ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry Lorenz, but you know what the professor says, no getting distracted on the battlefield!” Dorothea chided with a perhaps overly large smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh…you do have a point, Dorothea, and I suppose this is my loss–Hey!” Lorenz yelped before he could finish his speech as Lysithea grabbed his staff from him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I need it more than you!” was her prompt response before Lysithea used Thyrsus to launch a ball of light straight for Petra, catching her in the side and knocking her off her feet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Why do all my fights get interrupted?” Emily complained, frowning, before just moving right along to try attacking Dorothea, who caught her swing with a levin sword. “Huh? Since when do you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Since the professor suggested we all bring back-up weapons,” Dorothea replied with a grin, “Surprised?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A little, yeah. Thought you were some type of songbird.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been called that, certainly, but all birds have talons, my dear Emmy, and I always was decent at swordplay up on stage~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, guess I'll have to clip those talons," Emily taunted a smirk on her face, pushing Dorothea back as she got ready to attack. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Lysithea charged up another spell and aimed at Caspar, waiting for Balthus to give her a clean line of attack, until Shez suddenly grabbed her arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What do you think you're doing!?" Shez asked, a little panicked as she stared at Thyrsus in her hands. Did she not know what happens if you use a relic without the right crest?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wha–Why did you interrupt me!? I know what I'm doing!" Lysithea shouted back, trying to yank her arm free. Noticing Byleth moving to help Caspar against Balthus, Shez made an executive decision. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Everyone, pull back! Balthus, knock over some trees!" Shez shouted, pulling Lysithea closer to pick her up as she began to run away, much to both her and Emily’s displeasure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You got it!" Balthus shouted, punching Caspar in the gut hard enough to wind him before immediately knocking some trees over to cut off the path as they moved away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Frowning as the Golden Deer got away, Byleth couldn't help but wonder just what exactly Lysithea was doing. She had a minor crest of Charon, so why would she so readily jump to using the Thyrsus…? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, professor, what exactly is going on over there?" Dorothea asked, healing Caspar so he was still good enough to fight. Meanwhile, Petra had been knocked out from the earlier attack, so that was one of theirs down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, that's Hubert's plan." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course Hubie would start a fire…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't worry, it's under control," Byleth said, before gagging when she felt some bile rise up her throat. She braced herself against a tree, trying to keep steady as she felt another pang of pain in her stomach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor?!" Dorothea exclaimed as she moved over to her, concerned that she might have gotten hurt during the fight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just some stomach issues. I can still fight,” Byleth responded as she tried to clear her throat. "Come on, the sooner we win the sooner I can rest." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you say so, professor!" Caspar shouted, before a thought occurred. "Oh, should I carry Petra somewhere first?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I already admitted my loss, so I might as well carry Petra out," Lorenz conceded as he bowed to the Eagles. "I must say, it really is impressive how you were able to keep up with us. I see my father was right when it came to saying how skilled you are, Professor Eisner." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth smiled in response, trying to ignore how much her stomach was killing her as the Black Eagles continued on. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>When the battle had commenced, the Blue Lions vanguard immediately rushed towards the central platform of the battlefield. Keeping a smirk on his face, Sylvain led the charge of cavalier soldiers, using their fast mobility to reach it as quickly as they could. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No offense Ashe, but a part of me wishes Mercedes kept using a bow so she'd be the one riding with me," Sylvain commented to his passenger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...None taken?" Ashe responded, not really sure what to say to that, before focusing back on the central platform. "Ah! The Black Eagles are about to take it!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? Eesh, can't let us have any advantage huh?" Sylvain asked, before bringing his hand up to his mouth and letting out a loud whistle, signaling to Ingrid to flank them. Moments later the sight of pegasus knights began to fly down, slashing at the Black Eagles before rising back up before they could retaliate. As mean as it might be, Sylvain found himself a bit amused that among the spells aimed up at the Pegasus, there was also the occasional arrow that missed by a wide margin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though if anything her failure to take down Ingrid seemed to motivate Bernadetta to run faster, since they saw the mousey girl sprint to reach the top of the platform and collapse by the ballista. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, it seems we're gonna need to do some scaring," Sylvain muttered, before raising the Lance of Ruin and aiming at the platform. "Charge!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pulling out his own arrows, Ashe began to fire as well, aiming at any soldier or Black Eagle that was on the platform. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"AAAH! HUBERT YOU SAID IT'D BE SAFE UP HERE!" The two heard Bernadetta yell while she took some more wild shots. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It appears I miscalculated. Oh well, nothing to do-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"EVERY BERNIE FOR HERSELF!" Bernadetta shouted again, before immediately running away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, Bernadetta!" Flayn called after her, following behind her despite just reaching the top of the platform. "The enemy is the other way!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Honestly, why is it so difficult to find good help nowadays?" Hubert grumbled as he was left alone with a couple of knights, who didn't seem like they would be able to hold off the cavaliers and pegasus knights.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry buddy. If it helps, I'll make sure to apologize to Edelgard for you," Sylvain said with a smirk as they reached the top. Once they did, Ashe hopped off the horse and aimed his bow at the mage before noticing a…distinctly sweet smell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so? Well I'm afraid that'll have to wait until after the battle," Hubert smirked as a small fire appeared over his finger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eyes widening, Ashe began to back away. "Sylvain, watch out–!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Up in the air, Ingrid's eyes widened in shock as she saw the central platform go up in flames, a surge of panic hitting her before she realized Hubert had set the sides of the platform on fire instead of the platform itself, surrounding the group in flames instead of outright setting them alight–Jerking back, Ingrid was barely able to dodge an arrow aimed straight at her head. Following where it came from, she spotted Bernadetta who let out another volley of arrows alongside some archers, with some of them being able to take out her fellow knights. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Retreat!" Ingrid shouted, falling back, only briefly noticing that Flayn cast a rescue spell to extract Hubert from the ring of fire before the Church’s knights could do the same for him while they rescued everyone else, disqualifying them in the process. "They tricked us…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As much as she didn't like it, she couldn't help but admit the plan was brilliant. None of them expected Edelgard to nearly take out three of her classmates to wipe out the Cavaliers and two of the Blue Lions. It actually made her worry about what she might do next.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A worry that was shared by her professor and house leader.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did they really set fire to the central platform!?” Hanneman exclaimed, audibly baffled, “That’s been there for decades now! That ballista was practically an antique!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Edelgard certainly has a ruthless side to her,” Dimitri muttered as he stared at the growing flames. He took note that some pegasus knights from the church were actually flying over to put it out with a mix of wind and ice magic, so the whole thing wouldn’t be completely destroyed. Still, it was quite the move to make in what was meant to be a school exercise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, it is rather impressive,” Hanneman admitted, misunderstanding Dimitri’s comment, “Even if it is an extreme decision…well then, your highness, now that our strategy of seizing the high ground has quite literally gone up in flames, what do you propose?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…LIONS! HOLD FIRM!” he called out, catching the attention of his classmates, “Our foes have to come to us if they want to win–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t that what lost you the last mock battle, boar?” Felix yelled back, a scowl on his face, “You can’t tell me you actually want to hold back now, especially after those Adrestian bastards nearly roasted Sylvain!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Felix! That is an entirely inappropriate attitude to take towards your commanding officer!” Hanneman shouted back with a frown on his face, “You can’t bring these squabbles to the battlefield, especially when you have no idea what your enemy might do next!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Golden Deer spotted to the east!” called out one of their scouts, catching all their attention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Damn it, is Claude really pressing the attack right now?” Dimitri asked, readying himself for the crafty Leceisteran to make an appearance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, no your highness! It’s Miss Eisner, actually!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That prompted a blink. “What? Why would Shez be–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, looks like I really will be getting a good fight today!” Felix declared before heading towards the merc, prompting a grimace from Dimitri and a sigh from Hanneman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, clearly Felix’s discipline issues are far greater than I realized…Regardless. Your decision, your highness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, it seems our foes have indeed come to us.” And knowing Shez, he really couldn’t afford to just leave her be. “Everyone, we’ll handle the Eagles in time! For now, we strike at the Deer!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, towards that end of the field, Shez paused as she spotted the stone platform surrounded by people in blue. “Wait, that’s not our base.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Shez?! Did you really carry me towards the enemy!?” Lysithea snapped, before trying to push off her friend, “A-And let me down already!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, sorry–Crap!” Shez wound up dropping Lysithea completely as she had to bring her swords up to block Felix’s sudden strike. “Gh–Oh, hey Felix!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t the time to chat, it’s time to–!” And then Felix was clocked by a passing Balthus.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No time for you, kid, we’ve gotta take down that prince!” the muscular former Wolf/current Deer declared, sprinting towards the source of the most points. He didn’t get all the way there since Dedue moved to intercept him, blocking the buff brawler with his shield and nearly delivering a fight ending blow with his mace if Balthus hadn’t managed to disengage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Better get moving or you’re gonna fall behind, Shez!” Emily called out as she ran past, heading towards the prince too, though she had to deal with some blasts of wind from Annette and balls of light from Mercedes on the way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, we’re just going for it then–Ah, crap, sorry Lys!” Shez apologized, grabbing Lysithea off the ground and yanking her up. “You okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Lysithea spat out a clump of grass, then glared at Shez, who looked increasingly sheepish. “...Never do that again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure, you got it. Though I think we need to fight the Lions now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh please, I can handle that,” the youngest deer declared, before stepping forward with sigils of light and dark magic forming around her hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Across the field, Dimitri frowned as he saw his friends engaging their enemy classmates. A part of him wanted to jump into the fray, but Shez hadn’t joined in yet, so all he could really do was order their reserve soldiers to go aid his classmates– </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Is that Lysithea?” Hanneman wondered, prompting a confused glance from Dimitri who looked in the direction his professor was staring–And then he promptly tackled Hanneman off the platform.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>On the other side of Gronder Field, Edelgard felt a frown come to her face after she knocked out yet another Lion-affiliated soldier that had decided to try to charge the Eagle's fortified line. “That explosion wasn’t one of ours, was it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don't tell me you had Hubert blow up another part of the field, Lady Edelgard,” Ferdinand chided from atop his steed, frowning down at his house leader.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t. Though I can’t deny the possibility Hubert decided to do so anyway…” Her vassal could try to go over her head when it came to some matters, though she was fairly certain he didn’t have some back-up plan to kill one of the other class leaders during the battle. His fire plan was already pushing things and he actually talked to her about it beforehand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Speaking of explosions though, she did notice a series of yellow sparks shoot up from Constance’s position up in the air, their class’s morose flier proving particularly helpful as she indicated what Claude happened to be planning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard jumped back, noting the padded arrow that went flying by her face as she turned towards her rival house leader. “Hello Claude. I was wondering when you would be making an appearance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well so much for the element of surprise,” the heir of Riegan complained as he jumped down from the trees with a mock-frown that turned into his usual grin, “That numerical advantage of yours is coming in really handy, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A leader knows how to use what she has, particularly when it comes to negating whatever advantages her enemy might have.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still, sending two squads just to wreck my and Dimitri’s plans? It definitely throws off my divide and conquer plan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where is the rest of your house anyway, Claude?” Ferdinand asked, “Also skulking through the treeline?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could ask you the same. Even ignoring your two interception squads, aren’t you missing three mages?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re not missing,” Edelgard denied, “They just stayed on the other side of the bridge to flank your attempt to ambush us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On cue, a number of magical blasts slammed into the treeline, followed by several yelps and screams. From what Claude could make out, that was probably Raphael and Ignatz getting taken out already, which left him with Hilda and Leonie to back him up. Well, that and his surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, he made a show of sighing in annoyance. “Well there goes that plan. It’s a shame, I really was hoping I could get you too stretched thin to counterattack.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Consider it a lesson for the future, Claude,” Edelgard replied with a proud smile, “Quantity </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> quality will always win out against someone who has neither.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oof, going right for the throat there, your highness.” He smirked. “Unfortunately for you, I did have one more plan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She raised an eyebrow, not yet approaching him. And while it was reasonable for her to be cautious, Claude did feel a little amused at the thought that she could end things here just by pressing the attack. Having a reputation for tricky schemes did tend to keep people on guard. “And what might that be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Easy. It’s the rat at your feet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t expecting her to shriek that loudly the moment his words registered and he couldn’t help but laugh when she buried her axe straight into the ground at her feet. “A-Ah…nh, that wasn’t funny–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You cur…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude blinked, not expecting Ferdinand von Aegir, the second-most pompous noble in the monastery, just behind Lorenz, to actually sound genuinely pissed off–And then he was ducking a spear thrust that, were it not padded, probably would have taken his head off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah! Ah, hey, Ferd, I think you might be–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You would make a mockery of what she went through!?” Ferdinand snapped, continuing to press an attack that felt a lot more lethally intended than Claude felt was appropriate for a mock battle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, what? What was–” He jerked to the side, letting the spear miss his head, then blinked when it smashed straight into the tree behind him hard enough to break the wood. “...I’m gonna run now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“GET BACK HERE, CLAUDE, AND TAKE YOUR THRASHING LIKE A NOBLE!” Ferdinand shouted as Claude took off running into the wood, all while Edelgard stared in genuine shock at her “shield’s” unexpected rage. Which, wait…did he know about…?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shook her head, focusing back into the moment. It was a question for later. For now, she should hurry after them to make sure Ferdinand didn’t actually kill Claude. Though maybe a bit of thrashing was justified…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude, meanwhile, wasn’t quite in fear for his life yet, though he did make some mental notes about what would startle Edelgard but aggravate Ferdinand and that there did seem to be something deeper there. More than that though, he was kind of disappointed he didn’t actually get to do his big plan reveal–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey, Hilda!” he called out upon spotting his friend hiding behind one of the trees.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Claude? What are you–What happened to the thing you were gonna–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Change of plans, save me from Ferdinand!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She blinked. “From Ferdinand–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To her credit, she did move pretty quickly once she spotted the orange-haired noble about to slam his lance into the side of Claude’s head, catching it instead on the head of her axe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Hilda. So you weren’t taken out by the volley of magic earlier,” Ferdinand noted, bringing his spear back around and stabbing towards the pink-haired girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope! If there’s one thing I’m good at, it’s staying out of the way of trouble!” Hilda said, before trying to close the gap in almost direct defiance of her previous statement. Something Ferdinand was actually unwilling to let her do, instead backing up while stabbing forward with his lance to keep her at bay.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! As the professor says, the main advantage all lance wielders have is range!” he said with a grin, some of his usual demeanor returning, “You cannot break through my defenses if you cannot reach me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Hilda grabbed his lance and ripped it out of his grip before throwing it into the trees.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah ha, a foolish choice!” he declared, promptly pulling out a sword, “The professor also said to always have a back-up weapon!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Hilda promptly smacked that out of his hands too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And yet I planned ahead and brought a third weapon!” Ferdinand declared while pulling out an axe–And then a padded arrow smacked him in the face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, that was getting silly,” Leonie said from her perch in the trees, before glancing at Claude, “Hey Claude, what happened to that big plan of yours?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s still going on!” he called back, his earlier confidence returning now that there wasn’t a redhead after his head, “I’m sure by now our new friend’s managed to take out their line of–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A small fireball caught Leonie in the chest, knocking her down from her perch with a yelp right before Hilda just barely caught a blunted axe on her own before it could take her out of the game completely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, good reflexes,” Edelgard noted, before pushing harder and actually getting her fellow axe wielder to buckle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Heh, thanks, but it’s nothing special,” Hilda replied, before gritting her teeth and trying to push back against the…actually taller girl, huh. “What the heck, you’re taller than me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes? You didn’t notice?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not really? We don’t hang out much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, true. Well we could always rectify that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilda blinked. “Okay, never thought you’d invite me to hang out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Edelgard, could you please stop trying to poach my classmates?” Claude requested as he aimed his bow at her, “Seriously, we only just made up for Marianne leaving with Shez joining.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t you ‘poach’ one of mine in turn? You really have no room to complain,” Edelgard replied, keeping her focus on Hilda. Which was understandable considering they were having an axe clash, but Claude did still feel a little insulted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You mean Emily? Oh sure, she’s been doing great with the Deer, way more sociable than she ever was with you Eagles. Guess she just needed time to spread her wings?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Claude, as fun as this kind of banter, sort of flirting thing is to listen to, could you just shoot her already?” Hilda requested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, but I still haven’t even gotten to unveil my secret plan!” Claude complained, audibly amused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can gloat after you actually beat the person we came to take out!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, alright. Sorry Edelgard, it’s been fun, but–” And then Claude was struck by lightning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My apologies for interrupting your climactic showdown,” Constance apologized as her pegasus touched down, her hand still outstretched and sparking with the remnants of the thunder spell she cast, “I know a wretch like me has no place in intervening in a clash between such brilliant lords–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You did fine, Constance,” Edelgard replied as she disengaged from Hilda, who let out a little sigh that was half-relief, half-disappointment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well there goes our win…you just had to gloat, huh?” she said, pouting at Claude, who coughed out a bit of smoke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well…so much for that…” And he flopped backwards, ending the Golden Deer's chances of winning the battle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sound of trumpets began to ring out, signaling the defeat of the deer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, Constance, not that I don't appreciate the help, but why did you land?" Edelgard asked, glancing at the blonde.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My apologies, but despite how worthless I am, your plans would go awry if I were taken out. Once the young Almyran boy was able to take out Lindhart and Hapi, he aimed to make me fall from the sky like I deserve." Her explanation made Edelgard blink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Cyril?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, apparently Claude got permission to let him join the class,” Hilda explained, “That little kid is actually surprisingly good with the bow." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… I had heard he was apprenticing under Shamir…" Well, it was a good thing Claude focused far too much on his gloating. "Constance, I need you back in the air. Send the signal: everyone is to regroup so that we can finish off the Blue Lions!" </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Gotta say, Manuela, I knew you were impressive, but I didn't think you'd be this good with the sword," Dorothea said, complimenting her former mentor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't knock yourself short Dorothea, it seems my colleague has been teaching you well," she complimented back as their blades clashed, all while Dorothea’s classmate and professor dealt with the soldiers Manuela had backing her up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I did have two very good teachers to show me how to fight," Dorothea complimented, before charging her magic though the sword to try and shock Manuela. Pushing her back, the older songstress felt her arm get a bit numb and wasn’t able to move away fast enough to prevent a shock that made her grit her teeth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, it seems this won't be easy," Manuela grumbled, getting ready to cast a spell before she heard the trumpets sound out. "Oh, great, guess that means we lose." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, I was hoping to be able to face off against you," Dorothea muttered, a pout on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, I suppose we can't have everything~" Manuela teased as she glanced over at the other professor and student there, the latter who was on the ground panting in exhaustion. The former, however…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, Byleth, are you okay?" Manuela asked, concern evident in her voice as she saw the former mercenary hunched over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I'm good. Just-" Whatever she was about to say was cut off as she threw up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor!?" Dorothea shouted as she rushed over to Byleth. "Are you okay??" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My stomach feels like it's stabbing me," Byleth managed to get out before she threw up again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Frowning, Manuela walked over to Byleth as she pressed a hand against her back as a green glow settled over it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Byleth, I think you've been poisoned." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"WHAT!?" Caspar shouted, finding his second wind once he heard that despite all the knights he’d had to fight through. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…who would poison me?" Byleth asked, audibly confused and equally audibly sick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I think we should focus on getting you some medicine first," Manuela said, helping Byleth up as Dorothea got on her free side to also help her stand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I don't think you should stay on the field, professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea…" Byleth agreed, trying not to throw up again. "You don't need to help me off the field, Dorothea." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nope, I'm helping you get to the medical tent." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, don't worry professor, I'll make sure to tell Edelgard what happened, so don't worry!" Caspar chimed in, his energy fully returning…for about a second before he had to take a second to catch his breath. “Oof, feels like an afternoon training with dad…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Caspie, you come along too,” Dorothea insisted, “We can have someone else tell Edie what happened.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, c’mon, I can–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No arguing from the injured and exhausted!” Manuela firmly stated, before continuing to pull Byleth along, who was looking pale and sweaty as she tried her best to keep the contents of her stomach from spilling out again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though a thought did occur to her. “Oh, Manuela, you might want to talk with Lorenz about how to wield a magic staff, it seems he isn't used to fighting with something that isn't a spear–Ghm-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, yes, you can give me notes once we get you to the infirmary, professor, now come on!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay," Byleth managed to get out as she took in deep breaths. "Good work, Caspar, Dorothea." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, no need to thank us professor, it's thanks to you we made it this far." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It was Edelgard’s plan," Byleth deflected as they approached the medical tent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Still, I’m not sure how well things would have gone if you weren't here to teach us. You two make an amazing pair, you know," Dorothea praised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're incredible as well. Starting to think I might need to learn magic from you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, is that so? I don’t know, Professor Dorothea doesn't have the same ring to it as Professor Byleth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Manuela let out a small huff, unsure if she should speak up with this obvious, if odd, flirting going on. Well, for now, she'd just focus on what exactly Byleth was poisoned with and help with that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, the signal," Byleth muttered as an image of an axe and a spear clashing appeared in the air, courtesy of Constance. "Hopefully everyone is okay."</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned as she glanced over in the direction of the Golden Deer encampment, wondering if something happened to her classmates since no one had come over even after the signal had been sent. Had they experienced more trouble than they expected? A fair number of the deer's stronger members hadn't been part of the group meant to ambush her, so it's possible… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Leaving Shez and Balthus aside, she still wasn't aware of Kronya's full strength, and Lysithea was a veritable walking magic bomb with her crests. A part of her wondered if she reached out towards the mage and admitted she had dual crests as well, would she be willing to come to the empire? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let out a small sigh. No point in focusing on that now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It seems it's just down to us,” Hubert muttered as he glanced over to the remaining Eagles. Constance was still in an aerial battle against Ingrid while Marianne and Flayn healed the princess and her retainer. "That Ingrid is certainly a tenacious one. I think Bernadetta is going to have nightmares for weeks with how she dived down at her to destroy her bow." </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is she okay?" Marianne asked, worry evident in her voice, though she unintentionally flinched as Hubert turned his gaze towards her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, she's fine!" Flayn said with a smile. "It might have been terrifying, but Ingrid didn't hit her! Bernadetta only panicked and ran away, saying she couldn't fight anymore even though she still had a spear on her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm." It seemed Bernie still needed a bit of help with her confidence. Edelgard shook the thought off, facing her remaining classmates. "Well, even so, with these numbers we'll be able to defeat the Lions with ease, especially since their remaining forces are likely tired from fighting the Deer." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re not incorrect, Edelgard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The group of Eagles all paused, then looked towards the voice that just interrupted them, finding, who else, Dimitri along with his two remaining Lions, Dedue and Annette. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert promptly tried to blast the crown prince with a ball of darkness, though it was blocked by Dedue’s shield as the large student glared at his counterpart. “Ah well, can’t blame me for trying.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think I can, Hubert.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Our retainers’ rivalry aside, hasn’t anyone told you it’s rude to eavesdrop, Dimitri?” Edelgard asked as she stepped forward, axe in hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been told that, yes. Though I do think it’s somewhat more rude to nearly set your classmates on fire.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shrugged. “The flames were controlled. I wouldn’t set my own people ablaze.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, doesn’t that mean you’re fine with setting us on fire?” Annette asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is there a point to this?” Edelgard asked, ignoring the question since she doubted the Lions would like her answer, “Or did you just want to get the last battle of the day over with? Unless you wish to surrender outright. I would be quite happy to accept that outcome.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I think I still have enough of a chance for surrender to be unpalatable,” Dimitri responded, “But, in the interest of avoiding further possible injuries, I was wondering if you would consent to a duel between the two of us, Edelgard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It seems your side is the one who needs to worry about injuries," Edelgard said, noting how their healer had apparently been taken out. Little did she know that Mercedes had actually stayed behind because Dimitri accidentally cracked Hanneman’s ribs with that tackle of his.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hence my request. Come now Edelgard, I'm sure you are also wondering who would win in a match between us," Dimitri said, leveling his spear at her, hoping to egg her on. "Or are you saying you can only fight me with someone backing you up?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned at his taunt, about to decline it before she paused. While he was clearly trying to go for his only chance at winning, it was also a good chance for her. Her numbers were also low, and without the professor there to aid them, it left her as the only melee combatant, which could leave her allies in danger if Dedue rushed…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hmph. Very well. I must admit, I have been curious about crossing blades with you. As the house leader it's only right I bring victory to my house," Edelgard said, approaching Dimitri. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The same goes for me," Dimitri responded, as the two met in the middle of the houses, their weapons in hand as they prepared to fight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taking a deep breath, both heirs faced one another before they charged, signaling the final match of the Battle of Eagle and Lion. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>The clash of weapons echoed out over Gronder Field amidst gasps and cheers from the crowd surrounding the pair of royals battling one another. Encouragement was shouted from both sides, though it was noticeably louder on the Black Eagles side of things, if just because there were slightly more people.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"D-Do your best,” Marianne tried to cheer on as Edelgard dodged a stab towards her face, moving in quickly to strike with her axe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can do it, your highness! I know you’ll win this!” Annette yelled, watching her future king block the heavy hit before retaliating with a swing of his lance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re almost there, Edelgard!” Flayn pumped her fist, a big smile on her face as she saw Edelgard bat aside another strike with her shield before charging in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Go for it, Dimitri! Beat her down!” Shez encouraged, prompting a surprised look from Annette.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez? Why are you here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, I heard there was a fight going on over here so I came by to watch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Can you do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shrugged. “Nobody said I couldn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, off to the side, the pair of retainers stood side by side as their lieges battled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You know, I don’t plan to intervene in Lady Edelgard’s duel,” Hubert stated, glancing up at Dedue, “You don’t need to watch over me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Were you in my position, would you believe that?” Dedue asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…that is fair, I suppose. It is fascinating being on the other side of suspicion like this though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Back to the fight itself, Edelgard blocked more strikes from the prince of Faerghus, noting how his strength was actually putting dents in her shield. It would be impressive were she not on the other side of it. As it was though, she might need to get a new shield after this battle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From a defensive position, she could study her foe, and it led her to the conclusion that staying on the defense simply wasn’t feasible. He wasn’t tiring, he was strong enough to potentially break through her defenses entirely, and his longer reach lowered the chance of successful retaliation. So she decided to take a page from her professor’s book, starting by throwing her shield at his face when there was a brief lull in his onslaught.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri ducked on instinct, eyes widening at the unexpected move, but he was a trained fighter and he didn’t let his distraction last long enough to be taken advantage of, lunging right in and catching Edelgard’s axe as she swung in a wider arc than he expected, using one hand and catching the shaft of his spear on the dull blade, pushing it as she closed the gap and, before he could fully piece together what she was doing, driving her fist straight into his stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri choked, spit flying from his mouth as the air was driven from his lungs. He tightened his grip, trying to prevent himself from dropping his spear outright, then winced when he heard the sharp crack of wood as he wound up breaking it instead. With the wood splintering, Edelgard had a free opening to slam her axe into his chest in a blow that knocked him fully off his feet and to the ground with a rough thud, another grunt slipping out as he hit the dirt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your highness!” Annette gasped while Shez let out an annoyed groan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dang it. That’s twice today the guy I backed lost…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's it, that's the end of the Battle of Eagle and Lion! And the winners are, the Black Eagles!" Seteth called out, his voice being enhanced to call the battle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You've certainly gotten quite strong, Edelgard," Dimitri noted, sitting up as he reached a hand up, asking for help to get up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need for the praise," Edelgard said, grabbing his wrist to pull him up. "We might have won, but it could have gone the other way if we faced off against one another again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Still, you were quite remarkable." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not sure how remarkable using sheer numbers can be," Claude chimed in as he walked up, bandaged from his earlier lightning strike. "Really hoping we never have to fight for real." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, that would be regrettable," Dimitri agreed, rubbing his sore chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm. Oh, Shez, were you the one to defeat the professor?" Edelgard asked, pivoting away from that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? Wait, By got taken out?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I would assume so, since she didn't come once the signal was launched," Edelgard said, neither of the two noticing Claude stiffening for a moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Weird. I mean, I guess they might have fought Manuela and the knights she had, but last I remember she still had Dorothea and Caspar aiding her, so I don't think Manuela could have taken her out…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, ha, uh…about that…” In most circumstances, Claude wouldn’t have spoken up. Hell, he hadn’t before this point out of somewhat foolish hope that things would pass without incident and he wouldn’t have any problems. But if Professor Byleth was actually getting sick from his slip up…well, a part of him did still want to evade the consequences. “I think she might’ve eaten something bad, actually. She was looking sick earlier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She was?” Shez asked, immediately worried, while Edelgard frowned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When did you see Professor Byleth? She was in an entirely different part of the field.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just a little while ago, as I was heading over,” Claude answered, an excuse easily coming to him, “I was coming from the medic tents and I saw her going there with Manuela.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, she’s feeling that bad? Right, okay, I’m gonna go check on her,” Shez decided, nodding to everybody, “I’ll catch up with you guys later! Just gotta make sure she’s okay, you know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, of course Shez,” Dimitri agreed, which did prompt a small frown from Claude since the blond prince wasn’t her house leader anymore and shouldn’t be making that call, “Actually, do you know what she ate? We might need to check the food stores if she actually is experiencing food poisoning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh…no, sorry, I wasn’t paying attention. By tends to eat a lot anyway, so, y’know,” she replied, bouncing her leg a little anxiously to get going.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well if it was food poisoning, it might have to do with the poisoned food Claude attempted to feed his fellow house leaders two days ago,” Hubert offered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh? Really? You think it was–” It took a second for Hubert’s words to fully register for Shez, and when they did, there was a visible flash of orange in her eyes before she managed to rein it in. "What?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In my defense, it's non-lethal," Claude quickly said as Shez glared at him, "And you said you were okay with underhanded techniques." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"I meant kicking someone in the dick!" </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Putting aside your apparent attempt to poison me,” Edelgard spoke up, annoyed, “If the professor wasn't your target, why didn't you give her the antidote?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, I haven't made one yet," Claude admitted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Honestly, this is why amateurs shouldn't mess around with poisons. If it was me, I would have just used a sedative," Hubert joked, getting most of the students to stare at him in shock, while Shez, and to a lesser extent Edelgard, glared at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Look, Hubert, the only reason I'm not punching Claude is cause he's my friend. I don't know you that well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So you're saying I should start with you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha, good luck with that, I made myself immune to poison!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What?" Surprisingly, it was Marianne who spoke up first. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I used to eat a bunch of poisonous mushrooms to build up my immunity. I actually started by casting a mire spell on myself, but that was a bit too obvious so I got grounded. With the mushrooms though, it just looked like food poisoning." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." A silent feeling of horror fell upon the students as they stared at Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Shez, I'm not religious, but why in the name of the goddess would you do that?" Hubert asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"To get stronger, duh." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How are you still alive??" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Cause I'm strong!" Shez shouted, completely ignoring the blank stare that Arval, the entire reason she made it past thirteen, was giving her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Can we go check on your sister?" Arval asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, right, I need to check on By!" Shez shouted before she ran away, heading directly to the medical tent and leaving baffled schoolmates in her wake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, please don’t burst into a medical tent without announcing your presence,” Manuela chided as Shez did exactly that, though the mercenary pretty much ignored her professor in favor of going to her sister’s bedside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“By!! How are you feeling, what happened?! Wait, I know what happened–How are you feeling!?” Shez questioned, earning a somewhat exasperated sigh from her sister, who looked like shit and was holding a bucket. One that smelled pretty bad already so Shez was not putting her face anywhere near there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi Shez. Did my class win?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “Is that seriously the first thing you want to ask?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Did we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez frowned, annoyed. “No, my class won.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t lie to me, I was with Manuela when your class was eliminated. Did the Lions or the Eagles win?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hmph. Eagles.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yay–” Byleth stiffened, before putting her face in the bucket and vomiting, which made Shez wince.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What would you have done if I said the Lions won?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mhff…been sad. Probably still vomited too. Just with sadness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well I’m glad your vomit was happy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There you are Professor," Edelgard said as she entered the tent, a bit of worry in her eyes as she glanced down at the bucket. "How are you feeling?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Glad we won." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'm not sure if that's what we should be focusing on." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Here you go professor!" Dorothea chimed in as she entered the tent holding a small bottle. "I managed to get Hilda to give this to me, it should help. It's one of her floral oils, so it'll help with the smell." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, thank you," Byleth said, as she took the bottle with a free hand. "...Do I drink this?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, no," Dorothea denied as she took the bottle and opened it. "Just hold it under your nose when the smell starts to get overwhelming." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right," Byleth agreed, trying to focus on the bottle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Honestly, what was Claude thinking?" Edelgard muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He apparently poisoned you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...” Byleth looked more confused than angry. “Why would he poison me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Cause he was trying to poison Edelgard and Dimitri so they'd be sick during the battle," Shez helpfully explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Oh." Her sister frowned and narrowed her eyes. "He shouldn't do that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"By, please get angry at him poisoning you instead of him almost poisoning them…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I am angry at that, but I’m also angry that he tried to poison his classmates. Well, not quite classmates, more like–urp-” And back to the bucket she went.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard winced, before glancing at Manuela. “Will she be okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She should be. The poison seems to induce flu-like symptoms, for the most part, so while that is dangerous, she should be fine with some added healing and bed rest. From what I can tell, the main reason it’s this bad is because she kept fighting through the symptoms instead of bowing out earlier.” She sighed. “I suppose we’ll have to postpone any celebrations. Especially since we’ll need to discuss Claude’s punishment for poisoning a professor and attempting to poison his fellow house leaders. I'm also bound to get in trouble as well since I didn't even notice he was planning something like this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, you don't have to postpone any party because of me," Byleth tried to say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nonsense, professor,” Dorothea retorted, “It wouldn't be the same without you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Dorothea is right,” Edelgard agreed, “Celebrating without everyone after a hard won victory would feel rather hollow."  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It wasn't that difficult, it was an easy victory," Byleth said, an amused expression on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, that's not what you said earlier!" Shez shouted, "You said the fight would be difficult!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did I? I don't remember," Byleth claimed, looking away from her sister. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose it's okay to let victory go to our heads this time," Edelgard said, a smile coming to her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I mean, two houses were aiming for us, and poisoned our professor, but we still won,” Dorothea commented, “Just goes to show which house is the best~" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I won't disagree with that. In that case, we'll need to celebrate after you recover, professor," Edelgard continued, looking over to see Shez poking Byleth in annoyance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, we can celebrate our easy victory," the professor replied, ignoring the finger jabbing her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It wasn't that easy!" Shez immediately responded, making Byleth laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A full beat passed as the students there realized they were hearing her laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...h-hm, yes, I'm looking forward to it," Edelgard said, blushing a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, you have a lovely laugh, professor," Dorothea noted as she giggled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, thank you-" And Byleth once again put her face in the bucket, cutting the heartwarming scene short. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Claude felt some sweat trickle down his back as he came to the conclusion that he had vastly underestimated just how much trouble he would get in for poisoning a professor. He probably should have thought it through some more, and probably should have worked faster on the antidote, but he thought he’d calculated the risk well enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now though, as he faced down the angry glares of the archbishop, her chamberlain, and the captain of the Knights of Seiros, he was starting to think he might be bad at math.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Claude,” Seteth began, apparently electing to be the first speaker of the trio, “What in the world possessed you to attempt to poison your fellow house leaders?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Competitive spirit?” he tried, which was a bad move considering Rhea literally growled at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seteth didn’t look any happier. “Claude. You attempted to </span>
  <em>
    <span>poison</span>
  </em>
  <span> the house leaders of Black Eagles and the Blue Lions. Not only are they your classmates, who you should know not to harm in such a way, but they are the Imperial Princess of Adrestia and the Crown Prince of Faerghus respectively. And you, the future sovereign duke of the Leicester Alliance, decided it would be acceptable to poison them. Do I need to state why that idea should have never entered your head to begin with?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Claude had to admit, he should have seen this coming. It seemed simple enough, just get both of them and have it be blamed on a stomach bug. Easy, simple, got rid of two competitors before he had to deal with them, nothing he hadn’t done before. The problem, as he was discovering, was that they didn’t laugh things like that off in Fodlan. “I was hoping to get an advantage in the battle. I was told it was supposed to be treated like a real war, so I thought some…dishonorable tactics could be allowed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They are not,” Rhea stated, her voice low and furious, and Claude found himself reminded that this was the woman who really ran the continent of Fodlan. “If you had succeeded, you very well could have started a war between every nation in Fodlan, you stupid boy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He winced at the insult, fighting down the urge to bristle at it. “It wasn’t–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t care if it was a minor poison meant to induce sickness!” she snapped, shoving herself up from the desk, “The act alone would be enough to justify the entirety of House Riegan being accused of attempted assassination and put to the sword because of it! Derdriu would have burned because of your attempt to gain ‘advantage’! And yet, even as disaster was averted by mere luck alone, you still managed to poison a professor of this academy!” She glared at him, and maybe it was a trick of the light but it seemed like her pupils narrowed. “Give me one good reason not to have you expelled from the Officer’s Academy here and now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Claude did the only thing he could think of. He bowed his head. “I’m sorry. I didn’t think. All I can say is that it seemed like a good idea in the moment, and I didn’t think about what consequences there could be. I’m sorry Professor Byleth was hurt because of me, and I’m sorry I ruined what should have been the biggest event of the year. I screwed up, and I accept full responsibility for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea still glared at him, internally warring with the protective instincts that told her to damn all reason and have the boy thrown from the monastery’s walls, before Jeralt nudged her. She turned her gaze towards him and found her captain staring calmly back, his own anger hidden completely. “...hmph.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea sat back down, still annoyed, but willing to let Jeralt step forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good that you’re at least willing to admit your mistakes, kid,” the captain of the knights commented. Whatever anger he might have felt, he wasn’t letting it show as he decided to play the mediator here. “You screwed up, like you said, and that means you’re going to need to make it right. So how do you do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…I definitely need to apologize to Teach. As for how I'll make up for it…I feel like that should be up to her. I can say plenty of things I'd do to make up for it, but if she isn't satisfied with it, then it'd mean nothing." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Jeralt sighed. “Alright, good answer, kid. I can accept that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude couldn’t help his slight smile. “Thanks–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But that doesn’t mean you’re off the hook.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude paused. “Uh…in what way?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In the way that Rhea’s still pissed off, and I don’t think you’re getting out of here with just an apology.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am right here, Jeralt,” Rhea chided.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt gave Claude a pat on the shoulder. “Feel free to start groveling at any time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Claude got the feeling that Jeralt was a lot angrier than he let on. If anything, despite being the only one scowling, Seteth seemed to be the least angry out of the three of them. As he got down on his knees, Claude couldn't help but note that it was definitely interesting how angry Rhea was about Byleth in specific. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Hey, Teach, how are you doing?" Claude asked, knocking on Byleth’s door even as he opened it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, hi Claude," Byleth greeted from her bed, which…well, she still looked a bit sick, but she wasn't angry, so maybe that was a good thing? "Why did you poison me?" Scratch that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…I wasn't exactly planning on poisoning you. It was just a sort of backup plan." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay, why did you think that was a good idea?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, come on Teach, I'd have thought a mercenary would be more understanding," Claude joked, hoping to ease the tension. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, because I'm a mercenary. You're a noble." Byleth frowned. "There are different standards." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh? That's a surprise to hear." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It shouldn't be. Like I said, I understand wanting to use poison, but that doesn't mean I'd use it. As a mercenary, I might use dishonorable means in battle as needed, but there's still supposed to be some sense of conduct. If word spreads out that Jeralt’s Mercenaries use poison, we'd receive less contracts because we'd be looked down upon. That goes even more so for a noble. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A noble, especially one who will become Duke, is expected to act in a certain manner. If this had been an actual war, yes, your method could have gotten you victory, but then your allies would look upon you in suspicion. If someone is so willing to blatantly use poison just to get an advantage, then what's to stop them from using other methods their allies don't agree with?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You know professor, not that I'm trying to argue, but doesn't one of your students threaten to poison people all the time?" Claude pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hubert’s just like that. Besides, his position is different. He’s not the lord, Edelgard is. He might be noble, but he’s ultimately subordinate to her and that means he has different standards that apply to him. It’s understood that he’s Edelgard’s bodyguard, and that means it’s accepted he might be more willing to take harsh actions that she wouldn’t.” Byleth shifted slightly, folding her legs under the blanket and sitting up straighter. “If Edelgard poisoned someone, it would signal to everyone that she’s willing to use dishonorable tactics in a way that violates standard convention. If Hubert poisoned someone, it would be understood that he’s doing it to protect his liege.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Even then, there would likely be consequences for it, depending on the circumstances, and that’s why he’s the one doing it. Hubert’s willing to take any blame that might fall on Edelgard otherwise. As long as Edelgard’s hands remain clean, he’s served his purpose, even if that means he’ll be regarded as someone who can never be trusted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shifted again, before moving the pillow behind herself to prop herself up better. “You also have to consider the context. No one likes poison because it takes a moment you should be safe and makes it threatening. If everyone says ‘Claude will poison you at meals’, then no one will be willing to take meals with you. All of a sudden, eating with you is a danger, and one that can’t be looked past once that reputation sticks. If you, the poisoner, offer food at a negotiation, then that’s not a peace offering, it’s a threat. It doesn’t matter if you mean it genuinely, it doesn’t matter that you’re trying to be nice, the mere idea that you might have poisoned it will stick with people, and soon you’ll find that no one’s really willing to eat with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Eesh, when you put it like that…” It was almost funny. Here he was, a guy who loved celebrations and feasts, who never once felt safe at meals. Not until he was sure no one had decided the ‘half-breed’ should have an ‘allergic reaction’ again. “I guess I see your point, Teach. I messed up. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Apology accepted. You should probably apologize to Dimitri and Edelgard for the attempt too, make sure there are no hard feelings. And you should talk to your classmates about it too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude blinked. “Huh? Uh, why’s that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because you didn’t tell them you were planning to do something like this. That means you either didn’t trust them to know about your plans, or you thought they would stop you and wanted to do it anyway. It shows you don’t have any confidence in your allies and means now they’ll have to worry that you’ll make decisions without any input from them at all. That’s dangerous for any group, since it means people might start looking to break away from you rather than be associated with someone dishonorable, but it’s especially dangerous for you because you’re not a prince, you’re a noble among other nobles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dimitri can expect the other Lions to follow him because they’re loyal to his family. Edelgard can expect the other Eagles to follow her because they’re loyal to her throne. Their higher positions mean the other nobles are obligated to follow her. Meanwhile, Lorenz, Hilda, and Lysithea are your equals in standing, and Marianne would also be if she hadn’t joined my class instead.” …Was that a subtle dig at him? “Add in that Leonie, Ignatz, Raphael, and Balthus don’t have any reason to be loyal to you unless you’re willing to employ them, and a move like this could be taken as proof that you don’t trust any of them. That’s dangerous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm.” The problem was…he actually didn’t trust any of them. He could trust that they’d work with him while their interests aligned, but actually telling them about his plans…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, and Cyril’s probably going to be mad because Rhea’s upset with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, yeah, that sounds about right. Maybe he’ll simmer down when I mention part of my way of resolving things involved promising an increase in ‘donations’ from Riegan once I graduate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked. “...Claude, did you bribe Rhea?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” he replied, shamelessly, “Though it’s more like she extorted me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I also can’t help but notice you didn’t bring up Shez there, Teach.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well yeah, she’s obviously mad at you. I didn’t think I needed to say it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t, but it did kind of hurt to hear her confirm it. Well not really ‘hurt’, it just…felt bad. Kind of.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The fact that you don't have a black eye or something is probably the best sign that she is willing to forgive you. Also, and this is my personal opinion, I don't think you're good for her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Well that last bit threw him for a loop, especially with how serious she was. "Come on, Teach, there's no need for jokes here. It's not like I was actually trying to date her. No way in hell I'm getting in Lysithea’s way. Or Emily’s for that matter. They can start going at each other's throats, not me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good, then all you have to do is start showing some trust in others," Byleth advised, "I understand that there are times where you aren't sure if you can trust someone, but if you're going to be fighting together, you have to extend some trust. I'm not saying to go around, and tell everyone all your secrets, but they should at least know what you're planning when it comes to a fight." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...yeah, alright," Claude muttered, before shaking his head. "Well, before I go, is there anything you want me to get you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm good." Byleth said, before pointing towards the corner of the room. Turning his head, Claude paused as he saw the frankly absurd amount of flowers and medicine that had been tucked away, likely all from the students. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm quite popular," Byleth said, a smile on her face. Maybe it was a trick of the light, but to Claude’s eyes, it seemed vaguely smug.</span>

  <p>"You know, Professor Byleth probably got lucky she got the flu, otherwise Seteth would have lectured her for hours. I have a feeling he's probably pretty pissed that Flayn was involved with that scheme the Eagles had," Sylvain commented. "Probably not happy his sweet little sister was in danger there." </p><p> </p><p>"I don't see why you aren't more upset, you were almost set on fire," Felix said through a scowl. </p><p> </p><p>"Eh, not really. Sure the horses got spooked but the fire was actually pretty controlled," Sylvain added, before smirking "Though I didn't know you were that worried about me, Felix~"</p><p> </p><p>"I wasn't!"</p><p> </p><p>"Still, we should have realized something was up with how three support fighters were the ones leading the charge on that end," Ingrid muttered, "If Sylvain hadn't taken the moment to taunt, things would have ended up very differently for them." </p><p> </p><p>"Eesh, please don't tell me I'm going to get blamed for us losing." </p><p> </p><p>"Then take things seriously next time," Felix snarked, looking away from him in a huff. </p><p> </p><p>Letting out a sigh, Ingrid leaned back, not wanting to get caught up in Felix's bad mood. Though as she did, she noticed someone she wanted to speak to. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Bernadetta," Ingrid called out to the archer, making the young noble squeak. </p><p> </p><p>"Y-Yes?" She asked, eyes widening as she saw who was calling her. "A-Ah! S-Sorry for attacking you!" </p><p> </p><p>"...There is no need to apologize," Ingrid said, keeping her voice even. "I just wanted to talk, I'm a bit surprised about the plan you helped pull off. Were you forced to do so?" </p><p> </p><p>"Wh-what? N-no. I mean, it was s-scary, yeah, but Edelgard and P-Professor asked if I was okay w-with it," Bernadetta explained, forcing herself not to run away under the blonde’s scrutiny. </p><p> </p><p>"Really? Then that was all acting?" </p><p> </p><p>"O-Oh, n-not at all. Th-Those relic weapons are really scary! A-Ah, n-not that I'm saying you're scary for using them!" Even if she did feel like they were. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…I see," Ingrid noted, before letting out a sigh. "Regardless, it's our loss. I'll make sure to learn from this experience." </p><p> </p><p>"A-Ah, are you saying you're gonna come after me for revenge!?" Bernadetta squeaked out, before running away. "Forgive meeeeeee!" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Shaking her head, Ingrid decided not to think about that right now. </p><hr /><p>In the training grounds, the sound of wood impacting cloth sounded out as Ashe struck a wooden dummy with a spear. The young man had a frown on his face as he stabbed forward, remembering how he wasn’t able to do anything in the battle to help his teammates or even take out one of their opponents. Feeling frustrated, the former thief vowed to get stronger– </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I didn't expect to find someone here." Blinking at the sudden voice, he looked over to see Ignatz walking into the training grounds. "I hope you don't mind if I join you." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I don't," Ashe replied, pausing in his own training. "I didn't think anyone else would come by here." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah well, I wasn't planning on coming here earlier, but I wasn't much use in the Battle, so I was hoping to get a bit of training in." </p><p> </p><p>“Right, I can understand that.” Ashe laughed a little, scratching at his head. “I’m just…I’ve been trying to be a knight, but I don't know if it’s going that well.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, really? I, ah…well, I think I’m much the same, actually,” Ignatz admitted, “I’m here to become a knight for the sake of my family, but…well, I guess I can’t help but feel a little useless right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Useless, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, it’s…well, it’s rough to admit it, but I’m not sure I really have a place here…Even aside from the fact that I’m a commoner among nobles, everyone else in my class is just so impressive! Even the other commoners, Raphael, Leonie, and certainly Shez, they’re all just so much better than me at fighting. I don’t have muscles like Raphael, I’m not much better at a bow than Leonie, and I’m certainly not a one man army like Shez.” He sighed, smiling ruefully. “I guess all I have to do is try to get better at what I can do, right?”</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I know that feeling. I'm good with picking locks, but that skill doesn't really help in combat," Ashe admitted with a sigh. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I'm sure you can still become strong enough to be a grand knight." </p><p> </p><p>"Thanks for saying that," Ashe said with a smile, before pausing. "Do you want to train together?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, are you okay with that?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, if we're going to be here commiserating together, we might as well do it while training, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"Aha, I can see the logic there," Ignatz agreed as he smiled. "In that case, I hope I don't drag you down." </p><hr /><p>"Lady Edelgard, you wished to speak with me?" Ferdinand asked upon entering the house leader's room. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, please close the door behind you," Edelgard said, pushing herself up from her desk. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course." He responded with a smile as he did as she requested. "To what do I owe the pleasure?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ferdinand… what did you mean by 'what I went through' during the battle against Claude?" she asked, getting the noble to falter for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>"A-Ah, well, clearly it was wrong of him to use any fear of an opponent during combat to get them to drop their guard." </p><p> </p><p>"That's not what I meant," Edelgard said, her tone sharp, "Do you… know what happened to me?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…" His smile twisting into a frown, Ferdinand sighed. "...Yes, I know what my father did to you." </p><p> </p><p>"...How long have you known?" </p><p> </p><p>"A few months after your uncle had passed away," he admitted, his hands clenched into fists. "I was going to ask my father if we could visit you, when I chanced upon a meeting he was having with a suspicious individual named Myson… I wasn't able to catch all the details, but I heard them talking about the… experiments they did to you." </p><p> </p><p>"And why didn't you say anything?" </p><p> </p><p>"Because I couldn't believe it! My father, the man I idolized… how could I believe he would do that to children?" Ferdinand asked through a strained expression. "But, the more I thought about it… the more I saw how different you were… I tried to search for evidence, but either my father hid it well, or he destroyed what evidence there was." </p><p> </p><p>"Is that why you coddle me then?" </p><p> </p><p>"It was the only way I could think to make it up to you…" </p><p> </p><p>"I don't need to be coddled, Ferdinand," Edelgard stated, standing at her full height, and somehow making the taller noble feel small. "What happened has already happened. I don't need to be protected from something I already survived." </p><p> </p><p>"Then what was I supposed to do!? The more I dug, the more I found out how many crimes my father had committed! Yet I was unable to find enough evidence of any of them to prove…if at the very least I can make sure nothing happens to you again, then-" </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not a child, I don't need a caretaker," Edelgard interrupted him. "If you want to make up for it, then treat me with respect." </p><p> </p><p>"...You know, it is oddly amusing. Back when you were announced to be the heir, I couldn't help but scoff at the idea. Edelgard, of all people becoming the emperor? That child who would never separate herself from her older sisters or mother? I was even planning on taking it upon myself to challenge you, to see if you were worthy of being Emperor but…you went through all that, and still you remain so strong…" Ferdinand muttered, his eyes downcast. </p><p> </p><p>"If I am to ensure no one is to go through something like that again, then I cannot be weak. An Emperor does not need a nanny." </p><p> </p><p>"...You're right. My apologies, Edelgard." </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you," Edelgard responded, her eyes softening after a moment. "If you are to be my shield, I expect honesty." </p><p> </p><p>He looked up, surprise flashing in his eyes. "You would still have me?" </p><p> </p><p>"Despite your…eccentricities, you are still a valuable ally, Ferdinand. I swear that I will help you make your father see justice for what he has done. Though perhaps we should clear the air with Hubert first. He has had many things to say about you trying to be my retainer." </p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, well I have several things to say about him as well,” Ferdinand replied, settling back on familiar ground, “The retainer of an Emperor should not skulk about like he does." </p><p> </p><p>"Please don't start arguing with him…" Edelgard requested, letting out a sigh and hoping the headache she felt coming didn't actually arrive. </p><hr /><p>"I can't believe we lost," Lysithea muttered, angrily staring at the tome she was reading, until she heard someone knock on her door. "What?!" she called out, annoyance clear in her voice. </p><p> </p><p>"...I brought some sweet buns," Shez called out from the other side. "Figured we can have a snack before the feast later." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Marching up to the door, Lysithea pulled it open, snatched the plate of buns from Shez, and tried to close the door. </p><p> </p><p>"H-Hey! Wait a moment!" Shez said, managing to stop the physically weaker girl from closing the door on her. </p><p> </p><p>"Shut up, I don't want to talk to you right now!"</p><p> </p><p>"But I do!" Shez said, managing to get into the room. </p><p> </p><p>"Ugh… you know, if it wasn't for you, we would have won," Lysithea complained, frowning as she took the plate of sweet buns for herself. </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, a bit harsh, but winning that fight didn't matter as much as making sure you were fine. Why did you try to use Thyrsus? Don't you know what happens if you try to use a relic weapon without the right crest?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course I do." </p><p> </p><p>"Then why did you try to risk yourself like that? The fight wasn't serious enough to do something like that." </p><p> </p><p>"I wasn't risking myself!" Lysithea snapped back before she bit down on a sweet bun. </p><p> </p><p>"Look, I don't know if you've seen what happens to someone if they use a relic weapon, but I did. That thing would have turned you into a monster–" </p><p> </p><p>"I have a crest of Gloucester!" Lysithea shouted. </p><p> </p><p>Shez blinked. "...Huh? Wait, what do you mean? I thought you had a crest of Charon?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I do. I have both," Lysithea admitted, looking away from Shez, "That's what I wanted to tell you about before. The reason I'm so…naturally Inclined to dark magic is the same reason I have two crests." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…do you want to talk about it?" Shez asked, trying to speak softly.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmph… back when Hrym tried to revolt, my family tried to assist them. We were punished for it and the empire sent several people to keep an eye on us…" Frowning, Lysithea took another bite from the sweet bun. "Among them were several mages who…experimented on us. The end result was that I gained a second crest, but even that was considered a failure to them…" </p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean?" </p><p> </p><p>"My body was left weakened…I was never the strongest person beforehand, but I was left far weaker, and…I likely won't live past my twentieth, if I can even reach that." </p><p> </p><p>"What?" Shez asked, feeling her blood run cold. </p><p> </p><p>"That's why they considered me a failure. What's the point in making a powerful mage if she'll die in a decade?” </p><p> </p><p>"That, wait, no, you can't be serious–" </p><p> </p><p>"WHY WOULD I LIE ABOUT THIS!?" Lysithea screamed at her. "This is something I've lived with since I was young! There is nothing I can do about it!" </p><p> </p><p>"..." </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know if it was those people in specific who captured you, but I am certain they worked with whoever did it. I will never forget their sickly pale skin…" </p><p> </p><p>"Th-There has to be something that we can do!" Shez said, not wanting to think about her friend dying, "I mean, you can't have tried everything!" </p><p> </p><p>"I did! Nothing my family could find could remove this crest they put in me!" Lysithea shouted back. "I've accepted my fate, so now all I can do is make sure my family is okay once I'm gone!" </p><p> </p><p>"Well I haven't accepted it!" Shez shouted with genuine distress in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea stiffened, before glowering at her. "Why do you care so much?" </p><p> </p><p>"I just… I'm not good with people I know dying. So I just don't think about it. But that's always been after they died. What am I supposed to do when someone I know tells me they're dying?" Shez asked, her frown staying. "I don't… want you to leave. I like being around you. Sure, you might be harsh sometimes, but that's just a part of you. And knowing that one day that might just be gone…" </p><p> </p><p>"...That won't change anything. Like I said, my family has already tried-" </p><p> </p><p>"Then I'll find something, I swear!" Grasping her hands, Shez looked directly at Lysithea. "I know I'm not the smartest, but I'll do whatever I can to find a way to help you. So don't give up on life just yet!" </p><p> </p><p>"I-It's not that simple–"</p><p> </p><p>"I don't care if it isn't! I'm not going to give up, so you shouldn't! So you better be ready to live a long life, cause I'm gonna make sure you do!" </p><p> </p><p>“...” Lysithea felt herself wavering for a moment as an emotion she hadn’t felt for a long time welled up in her chest. Was she really feeling…hopeful right now? She couldn’t…she couldn’t afford to think like that. But something about Shez…made her want to believe her. “...F-Fine. I suppose we may as well try…Though I am not sure what you think you can do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, uh…oh! I know about the people that did this! Kind of? I know they’re from some place called Agartha and Rhea knows about them!”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea blinked. “What? Wait, what??”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it’s a whole thing–Here, let me explain. Rhea told me not to tell anybody but I think this is more important,” Shez said, looking around as if she was worried someone might pop out. "After that thing with Tomas, Byleth and I talked with Rhea. She didn't outright say anything, but she seemed to know about them. So the church probably has to have something about them." </p><p> </p><p>"I–Would they?" </p><p> </p><p>"There's a chance they might! Just… are you okay with me telling Byleth about this? Rhea seems to like her a lot, so we might have a chance to learn more about them if we have Byleth ask her." </p><p> </p><p>"...” Lysithea stared at her for a moment, not sure if she could dare to hope, but… “I'll trust you. If you think she can help, then okay." </p><p> </p><p>"Thanks!" Grinning widely, Shez pulled Lysithea into a hug. "I'll get back to you as soon as I can!" Shez said, getting up as she got ready to leave. "Ah, but don't forget the feast! Even if you live a long life, you gotta make sure to live it to your fullest!" </p><p> </p><p>Watching the young mercenary run out, Lysithea could only stare after her as she felt her heart thumping in her chest. </p><p> </p><p>"...I-Idiot," she mumbled to herself, her face turning pink. </p><hr /><p>Byleth was feeling pretty good, all things considered. Sure, she’d been poisoned not that long ago, but it passed pretty quickly and she’d gotten so many well-wishes, she honestly felt like it was a pretty fair deal.</p><p> </p><p>“Seriously? Don’t be happy that you were poisoned!” Sothis complained, sounding annoyed as Byleth walked along towards the dining hall, where the students and faculty were finally going to celebrate their victory/losses at the Battle of Eagle and Lion. Well, it wasn’t so much that they were celebrating losses as it was they were celebrating doing their best…but also Byleth was going to celebrate the fact that everyone else lost while her class won. “You are a truly ridiculous child…Speaking of children, are you really willing to simply leave things as they are? That Riegan boy poisoned you, and yet he’ll see no punishment for it at all!”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s being punished. He had to apologize and bribe the church.”</p><p> </p><p>“That is scarcely a punishment! You would think they would seek further retribution, rather than simply pretending your ailment was a simple stomach flu.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth shrugged. “I don’t care about punishment. It’s better that he learned and won’t do it again.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you have said the same if one of your students had been poisoned?”</p><p> </p><p>“...If Claude had poisoned one of them I would have punched him.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Why must I be stuck with a self-sacrificing fool?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not self-sacrificing. I just don't like seeing people I care about get hurt." </p><p> </p><p>"Then think about what would happen to me if you die!" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth paused as she thought about, trying to figure out a response to that. "...I just won't die then." </p><p> </p><p>Sothis could only stare at Byleth as she said something that made complete sense to her and her alone. Ignoring the spirit in her head, Byleth continued on to the dining hall, arriving just as the feast was on full swing.</p><p> </p><p>"There you are, my teacher. I was starting to worry that you hadn't yet recovered from your illness," Edelgard greeted, a smile gracing her features as Byleth walked in. </p><p> </p><p>"Really? I was starting to think it was something else," Claude said, noticing them. "Guess she isn't mad about being used in a 'sacrifice' squad." </p><p> </p><p>Sothis made an offended noise. “He hasn’t learned anything!”</p><p> </p><p>"How many times do I have to say this? It wasn't called a sacrifice squad," Edelgard complained, equally annoyed at his phrasing. </p><p> </p><p>"Well you do have to admit if something had gone awry, two squads of your classmates, as well as your professor, would have been taken out," Dimitri noted. </p><p> </p><p>"I was completely confident in all their skills to be able to accomplish the mission," Edelgard said, before smirking. "Besides, at least I didn't knock out my own professor by tackling them." </p><p> </p><p>"I-I was just trying to keep Hanneman safe!" </p><p> </p><p>"Hey! Let the professor hang out with the rest of us!" Caspar shouted, managing to squeeze through the house leaders and grab Byleth’s arm to pull her towards everyone else. </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, come on 'big bro' you can't pull a girl like that," Dorothea teased, almost making Caspar stumble. </p><p> </p><p>"I am having trouble understanding. Caspar is smaller than you, why are you calling him 'big'?" </p><p> </p><p>"Pretty sure she's just messing with him, Petra," Hapi explained. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I see, it is friendly banter!" </p><p> </p><p>"Come now my attendant! It is time for you to lavish praise upon us, especially to me, as my reconnaissance was paramount to our victory!" Constance stated, letting out a laugh as she did. </p><p> </p><p>"I'd prefer being allowed to leave this feast so I can nap," Lindhart muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"Come now Lindhart, where's your sense of comradery?" Ferdinand asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Perhaps he is simply tired from actually helping in the battle? Unlike a certain someone, he didn't end up getting his weapons pulled out of his hand," Hubert mocked, smirking, even as his tone wasn't as sharp. </p><p> </p><p>"W-What was I supposed to do!? Ingrid dived down right at me!" Bernadetta squeaked, misunderstanding where the jab was aimed. </p><p> </p><p>"N-No, you did wonderfully, Bernadetta," Marianne reassured, trying to calm down the Archer. </p><p> </p><p>"Everyone did great!" Flayn cheered, the green-haired girl smiling widely. "I never thought joining a class would be as fun as it is, and I'm glad I joined the Black Eagles!" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Smiling, Byleth couldn't help but feel the swell of joy as she looked upon her students. "All of you were incredible. You've come so far since I first met you, and I'm sure all of you will go even further." </p><p> </p><p>With that, she approached her students and began to give them all a pat on the head, making the students get a bit flustered at the praise. </p><p> </p><p>"Now come on, let's enjoy-" </p><p> </p><p>"Byleth! We need to talk!" Blinking as she heard her sister call her by her full name, the professor felt her hand grab before she got dragged away. </p><p> </p><p>"Shez?" </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, this is important!" she shouted as she ended up dragging her all the way to her room. </p><p> </p><p>"What's going on?" Byleth asked, a bit worried. </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, this is important. Lysithea and I really need your help," Shez said, sounding completely serious. </p><p> </p><p>"What do you need?" </p><p> </p><p>"You saw how Lysithea tried to use Thyrsus right?" Shez asked, getting Byleth to nod. "She has a crest of Gloucester, along with the crest of Charon." </p><p> </p><p>"What?" Byleth had to hold herself back from asking 'like Edelgard?'.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, those guys who tried to take Flayn and me were behind it. That's not the important thing though, we need your help to see if Rhea can tell us anything about them." </p><p> </p><p>"Can I ask why?" she asked, wanting to help but also wanting to know why Shez seemed so desperate.</p><p> </p><p>"Whatever they did to her…apparently it'll kill her. As far as she's aware, she doesn't even think she'll be alive in five years."</p><p> </p><p>"...What?" Byleth asked, feeling her own blood run cold as her mind flashed to Edelgard. </p><p> </p><p>"Just, we gotta do something to help her! So please!" </p><p> </p><p>"...Okay, just give me a bit, I need to talk with someone first," Byleth said, leaving her room as her own mind raced. </p><p> </p><p>Why hadn't Edelgard mentioned that? Did she not know, or did she not want her to worry? </p><p> </p><p>Gritting her teeth, Byleth felt an unpleasant rage she hadn’t felt in a long while swell up again. Whoever these Agarthans were, they were going to pay. </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Edelgard, can I talk with you?" Byleth asked upon returning to the feast. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh? May I ask why?" </p><p> </p><p>"Something important, if we can talk in private," Byleth responded.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh~? Seems like this might be important, Edie. Why don't you go on with her~?" Dorothea asked, nudging her friend. </p><p> </p><p>"I-I'm sure it's nothing like what you're assuming, Dorothea."</p><p> </p><p>"Still, you should go on ahead! I'll make sure no one follows to bother you two," Dorothea said, giving her friend another nudge. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Dorothea," Byleth replied, nodding at her student before she glanced at her other student. "It won't take long." Letting out a small sigh, Edelgard got up to follow her.</p><p> </p><p>"What did you want to speak about, professor?" Edelgard asked, faintly curious. Staying quiet for a moment, Byleth made sure no one was nearby or trying to listen in, before she faced Edelgard again.</p><p> </p><p>"Edelgard, about what you told me about before, about what happened back in Enbarr. Were there any… side effects?" Byleth asked as they stood in a corner of the entrance hall. </p><p> </p><p>"Well… my hair lost all pigmentation for one," Edelgard responded warily.</p><p> </p><p>"That's not…" Frowning, Byleth took in a deep breath. "How much longer do you have to live?" </p><p> </p><p>"...How did you find out about that?" </p><p> </p><p>"I found out someone else went through the same thing, and that they might not live long either."</p><p> </p><p>"..." Letting out a breath, Edelgard composed herself. "I assume you mean Lysithea?" </p><p> </p><p>"Did you know?" </p><p> </p><p>"I had my suspicions but… nothing I could confirm without asking her," Edelgard said, looking away from Byleth. "Yes, while I doubt my condition is as drastic as Lysithea’s, I did lose a portion of my lifespan. If those that experimented on me were correct, I'll live to be fifty, but not much more. Long enough to live a decent life, I suppose, though it’s entirely possible that my health will start failing earlier." </p><p> </p><p>"...Is there any way to reverse it?" </p><p> </p><p>"In theory, yes. In practice… it is not something I have spent much time on." </p><p> </p><p>"Why not?!" </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard paused, not expecting the sudden show of concern from Byleth. "Because…These crests might be a curse, but I need their power. I already told you what I want to accomplish, Professor. Even if it takes my entire life, I will accomplish my goals. If I can help Lysithea, then I will, but I won't relinquish this power until I no longer need it." </p><p> </p><p>"That… then let's go to Rhea at least, I'm sure she can-" </p><p> </p><p>"No!” she immediately interrupted as a jolt of panic went through her, “Professor, you absolutely cannot tell her about this!" </p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked, not expecting such a vehement reaction. "Why not? You both have a common enemy with the Agarthans, don't you? </p><p> </p><p>"Do you think the church would be fine with what we are discussing? They hold crests to be sacred above all else, and we are talking about removing them,” Edelgard said, thinking fast, “Do you think Rhea will truly believe us if we tell her we just want to remove a crest from Lysithea and I? Can you swear to me that you completely trust her?" </p><p> </p><p>"I…want to trust her," Byleth murmured, her hesitation obvious. </p><p> </p><p>"But do you?" </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t. She knew that the instant the question was asked. She wanted to trust Rhea, but she just…didn’t. Not when she knew the archbishop was still hiding things from her.</p><p> </p><p>“...What do you want me to do then?” she asked, feeling unusually off balance. “I…Shez wants to talk to her, to learn more about the Agarthans so she can try to help Lysithea.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard felt her heart stop for a moment. If Rhea learned about Lysithea, how difficult would it be for her to learn about Edelgard’s own experiences? Would she think to look? What would she do in that circumstance?</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t assume her enemy was unintelligent, she knew Rhea had run the Central Church for a thousand years, if she was presented with a girl who had two crests and lost the pigmentation in her hair as a result…And what if she did find out? The Church valued crests, <em> Rhea </em> valued crests, if she learned there was a way to grant people more than one crest–</p><p> </p><p>“Edelgard?” </p><p> </p><p>Her teacher’s voice cut through her swirling thoughts and Edelgard took a steadying breath. She was strong. She wasn’t going to let what happened to her happen to anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>So she fought down the images in her mind of being chained down again, only this time with the Knights of Seiros standing over her instead of those horrible mages in their bird-like masks, and faced her professor again. “I’m sorry to ask this of you, professor, but please refuse your sister’s request.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Are you sure, Edelgard?” Byleth asked, the concern in her voice obvious, “It could help.”</p><p> </p><p>“It could. But it could also destroy everything I’m working towards. So, please, professor. I promise, I’ll do everything I can to help Lysithea once I am able, but I cannot take a risk in trusting Rhea right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>At her teacher’s acceptance, Edelgard felt a swell of relief, though she tempered it when she noticed the conflict present on her teacher’s normally stoic face. “...I presume there is a condition though?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. I want you to talk to Shez and Lysithea about it. If I’m going to be denying Lysithea the help she might need, she deserves to hear the reason why.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” She sighed. “...That is a reasonable point, professor. I can accept your condition.”</p><p> </p><p>It was hard to miss the relief on her professor’s face as she agreed. Edelgard knew there was a risk here, trusting so many with her secrets, but…she wanted to, hypocritical though it may be. </p><p> </p><p>It might be foolish, but she wanted her teacher by her side.</p><hr /><p>Shez felt sick to her stomach. She’d been surprised when Byleth came back with Edelgard and even more surprised when the two of them asked to talk with Lysithea, but she’d gone along with it and brought her friend over to join in. She hadn’t expected Edelgard’s story though. And the more she heard, the more horrified she felt to have any connection with those monsters.</p><p> </p><p>“There will be many things I have to do, but once the year ends, I will be crowned emperor, and I promise to use everything that I have to help you,” Edelgard vowed, “There were some documents left behind at the palace by them, which may assist us in helping you.” </p><p> </p><p>“To think they could even do this to someone like an imperial princess…” Lysithea said, stunned at the revelation. “I had thought it had only happened to my family because of the power we lost…” </p><p> </p><p>“That…are you sure we can’t talk with the church for help?” Shez asked, her head still swimming with all this new information.</p><p> </p><p>“Think about it. These Agarthans are a group the populace knows nothing about. I assume your father also had no knowledge of them, and yet he was a knight captain,” Edelgard explained, trying to be rational. Or at least sound it. “We already know the church destroys classified documents, and the Agarthans themselves are likely only known to Rhea as a long forgotten enemy of the church. Even if they still have documents about them, they likely won’t have anything about what sort of abilities they have.” </p><p> </p><p>“...I will admit, I can understand your logic,” Lysithea said. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, wait,” Shez said as something came to mind. “Why did they leave you alone? Lysithea was supposed to be a ‘failure’ but you were what they wanted right? Then why aren’t you under their control or something?” </p><p> </p><p>“...That is because their former leader passed away, and the one that took over after him seemed to have no interest in trying to leash me,” Edelgard explained, thinking about the Agarthan named Myson who Ferdinand had brought up. The one Bias had confirmed had a hand in the experiments run on her. “Duke Aegir was tasked with keeping an eye on me, but his incompetence led to me having more freedom than they intended.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Was it your uncle?” Byleth asked, causing Edelgard’s breath to hitch. </p><p> </p><p>“Huh? What about her uncle?” Shez asked. </p><p> </p><p>“When we first met…you never once seemed sad about your uncle's passing,” Byleth continued, addressing Edelgard, “And he had also been involved with the insurrection, right?” </p><p> </p><p>“...The man I had called my uncle was replaced a long time ago. It likely happened sometime after he took me to the kingdom,” Edelgard said, steeling herself. “Mourning the man I once knew won't change anything. All I can do is march onwards to the future. To that end, Lysithea, once the year is over, will you come to the empire with me? It may be difficult, but if the two of us are there, then a way to reverse this will become that much easier once the time comes." </p><p> </p><p>"...Can you promise me that even if this fails my parents will be okay?" the young girl requested.</p><p> </p><p>"H-Hey, don't act like we’ll fail without even trying!" Shez spoke up. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not! Just…I want to make sure my family is taken care of even after I pass away. That's what I wanted to focus on, but if I am to turn my attention elsewhere, I want your word they'll be okay." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard nodded solemnly. "I swear it upon the Hresvelg name, that your family will want for nothing. It is the least I can do for how the empire has made you suffer." </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you," Lysithea said, the tension in her body slowly releasing. </p><p> </p><p>"Perhaps it would be best if we retire for the night?" Edelgard suggested. "We can discuss what to do at a later date." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yeah, probably for the best. Here, come on Lysithea, I'll help you to your room,” Shez offered. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't need your help," the mage muttered, even as she accepted her hand. </p><p> </p><p>"...I must say, I didn't expect this conversation," Edelgard managed to say after the two left the room. "Though…it feels good being open about this." </p><p> </p><p>"Even an Emperor needs help," Byleth said, relieved that her sister had gone along with their change in plans. "No matter how strong you are, you can't change the world on your own." </p><p> </p><p>"...Perhaps you're right, professor," Edelgard admitted. "You said you would assist me when it came to achieving my goal, correct?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes. Though I may be under contract with the monastery right now, I'll do everything I can to help you," Byleth said, before pausing. "Though don't let Jeralt know I said that. I don't think he'd appreciate it if I accepted a contract without knowing any details." </p><p> </p><p>"Ever the mercenary, aren't you?" Edelgard asked, letting out an amused chuckle. "Regardless, I look forward to your assistance during my eventual reign." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm looking forward to it as well," Byleth said, smiling. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you. Now, you should head back to the festivities. It's only right that you get to enjoy yourself." </p><p> </p><p>"Aren’t you coming along?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, there is much I need to think about. Though if you would, could you tell Hubert to come by? I need to discuss what we talked about with him." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm. I can’t say I’m surprised Hubert is already in the know…Very well, just make sure not to stay up late," Byleth requested, bowing to her before she left. Letting out a sigh, Edelgard collapsed onto her bed. She was certainly going to be in for it knowing how displeased Hubert would be about sharing so much. </p><p> </p><p>Still, it felt good being honest, and she would need allies for what she was planning. No matter how long it took, she would gather the forces she needed and change the world, even if it cost her her life. </p><hr /><p>"So, how'd it go~?" Dorothea asked once Byleth sat down so she could properly join the feast. "You were gone for quite some time." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, I just had to talk about something important with Edelgard," Byleth explained, grabbing some meat skewers so she could eat. </p><p> </p><p>"Really? Would that be what you told me about before?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh… should I have told her about that?" Byleth inquired, a bit curious. </p><p> </p><p>"...well, it might have helped," Dorothea said, internally sighing. "I mean, if you ask me, it does seem like couples are starting to form."</p><p> </p><p>"They are?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, you just need to keep an eye out," Dorothea explained, glancing around the room for examples. "Hilda certainly seems to be trying with Marianne, and I have to admit, there is something cute about Bernadetta not finding Hubert as scary anymore." She noted as she saw the pink-haired girl leaning close to the blue-haired one, while the anxious archer seemed to be fidgeting a bit more now that Hubert had left. "And you can't tell me Constance doesn't feel something for Hapi. If it was anyone else, she probably would have cast one of those weird spells of hers on them for shoving food in her mouth." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh…" </p><p> </p><p>"Yup yup, so what do you think? Made any progress yourself?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not particularly…" Byleth admitted. Those thoughts had taken a backseat recently. "I talked with Manuela a bit and she gave me some advice but…I think, at the very least, I won't be dating anyone until the year ends." </p><p> </p><p>"Really?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I still don't know how that stuff feels but… for now, I think I want to focus on making sure all of you graduate." </p><p> </p><p>"You know professor, just cause you're in charge of us doesn't mean you can't take care of yourself too," Dorothea noted with a mock pout. </p><p> </p><p>"I know, but… the advice Manuela gave me was to just go on a date with someone, and if I'm being honest, I don't know who I would go on a date with," Byleth admitted. "So for now, I'll focus on this job, and then I'll think about romance." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…well, if nothing else, I have to admire your dedication," Dorothea praised.</p><p> </p><p>"Hm." Bringing the meat skewer up, Byleth began to eat. "Still no luck on your end?" </p><p> </p><p>"Nope. I mean, Ferdinand asked if I wanted to have tea together, and well… tea is one thing, but I can't really see myself spending my life with him. That's not even to go into how bad the others can be. All Felix seems to care about is flailing his sword about, Sylvain is an entire mess unto himself, and Ingrid… she's cute, but she doesn't seem to be interested," Dorothea muttered with a huff. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm… what about Edelgard?" Byleth asked, getting Dorothea to choke on air. </p><p> </p><p>"E-Excuse me?" </p><p> </p><p>"You two are close right? You don't ever seem to say anything negative about her, and even since the start of the year, Edelgard admired the hard work you put in." </p><p> </p><p>"She did?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, even if you came here cause you wanted to find someone to marry, you've still given it your all. I'm sure Edelgard would be happy to be with you." </p><p> </p><p>"C-Come now professor, you certainly chose the weirdest times to joke around," Dorothea said, feeling a bit flushed. Before Byleth could speak, Dorothea stood up. "Anyways, why don't you go hang out with everyone else? I'd hate to take up all your time!"</p><p> </p><p>Frowning a bit at how quickly Dorothea left, Byleth couldn't help but wonder if she went a bit too far there. She didn't mean anything bad by it, but…</p><p> </p><p>Sighing, she focused on eating for now. Romance should be the last thing on her mind, her students were in danger, and who knows what else would happen this year. Until this was all settled, she would give it her all to keep them safe. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>“Good people of Fhirdiad, lend me your ears!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The voice of the king-regent, Rufus Thierry Blaiddyd, Grand Duke of Itha, echoed out through the streets of Fhirdiad, which were almost silent as its citizens gathered in the square in front of the palace, clamoring to see the king upon his stage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For too long, our proud Kingdom has languished!” His voice rang loud and clear, a shocking sound for many who had never even heard the regent speak. “In the past decade we have suffered greatly! Pestilence, famine, and violence have ravaged our people! Bandits have run free, allowed to steal even our holiest of relics for their own cruel ends! Invaders from foreign lands have threatened what little peace we have, and even the heirs of our great houses have not been kept safe! Mere months ago, the heiress of House Galatea was even abducted by an Adrestian noble and only barely saved by the Knights of Seiros, who should have never allowed such danger to come to her to begin with!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We all know of the tragedy that befell our royal family, wherein my own brother was viciously murdered by the devils of Duscur! And yet despite this horrific crime, we were not brought justice! We had to seize it with our own hands! And that, my people, is why I speak to you today!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He thumped his fist against the breastplate of his armor, for a moment looking exactly the picture of a grand warrior king in the eyes of the populace. “I stand here with the knowledge that you have suffered! That we have suffered! For as your king, I weep for every tragedy that befalls our gracious people! And as your king, I swear an oath to you, my people: No more! No more shall we fear the violent, the cruel, and the foreign! We shall stand strong and true, for the Goddess has gifted us with a most gracious opportunity!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As many of you know, the Western Church betrayed Archbishop Rhea.” Not many truly knew that, and there were many gasps among the crowd. “What you may not have known was the true depths of their betrayal, for the Bishop who led that rotted bastion of corruption was in fact a traitor to this very kingdom! For he was the cur who rallied the dogs of Duscur to murder my brother! To murder your king!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shock and horror spread through the crowd, scandalized gasps ringing out followed by angry calls. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rufus held up a hand, his head bowed, hushing the crowd. “I know, my people. I understand your fury, for I feel it just as strongly! Yet we cannot falter in this time of trial! The Goddess rewards the stalwart, and so it has been chosen that the Western Church be reformed! A new Bishop has been selected, one who bears no sin of corruption, but has been chosen by our very own Lady Cornelia, she who saved our people from the ravages of plague!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a smattering of applause and cheers from plants in the audience, encouraging genuine positivity among the masses as the court mage beside her king bowed her head with a humble smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To that end, I present to you Sergei of House Gideon, the new Bishop of the Western Church!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man in question wasn’t especially outstanding. He had the standard brown hair of most Fodlaners and a short beard, lending him a slightly more grizzled look, particularly given the suit of silver armor he wore, his helmet held under one arm. He placed a hand on his chest and bowed to the people of Faerghus, a gesture that caught many by surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good people of Fhirdiad, in the name of the goddess, I promise to serve you faithfully as a sword of the faith.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed he shall!” Rufus agreed, taking center stage again, “For Faerghus is in need of a sword! No, not merely a sword, but a lance! One capable of piercing through the hearts of those who would do us ill! Thus I have decided Faerghus shall have its lance! A new one, crafted in the honor and faith of our people! And those who wield it shall be the storm, striking with our fury at those who seek our ruin!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Today, my people, I declare the formation of the Tempest Knights! The new Protectors of Fodlan!” He gestured again, prompting a second man forward, one in azure armor decorated with silver lightning. And the man, clad in his gleaming armor, thrust his lance skyward, its body black and its head yellow as a boom of thunder rang out and a bolt of lightning raced from the sky, striking the head and casting the surroundings in a rainbow of color.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shock turned to elation as the citizens of the kingdom saw what could only be an indication of divine favor. Cheers rang out for their king, cheers he had never once heard before. And King Rufus Thierry Blaiddyd smiled, for he finally had the adoration he knew he deserved.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“That was disgusting,” ‘Sergei’ commented once his helmet was back in place, hiding the revolting features of the vermin he’d had to pose as.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, you have no passion for theater, Chilon,” Cleobulus chided, mock-pouting and earning a shudder of disgust from her colleague.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have no interest in whatever ‘production’ this is meant to be, Cleobulus. I only aid you because–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because I have a better chance of actually seeing the vengeance of our people finally be accomplished?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because you requested it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you just want a purpose again. That’s fine, I can accept that. So long as you’re willing to play along with me and Rufus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chilon sneered. “‘Rufus’? You care for the vermin’s name?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Ah, Chilon, you really are such a simple man. Then again, you did earn your sagehood through strength and stature…regardless, Rufus isn’t vermin, he’s a pet. A domesticated beast has its uses, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I see. And did you lay with this ‘pet’ of yours yet?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A flash of genuine anger crossed Cleobulus’s borrowed face before she smoothed it out into a far too calm smile. “Be careful, Chilon. You’re not playing bodyguard anymore. This isn’t Shambala, and you’re not just an upjumped door guard with a fancy title. You have duties to uphold, and if you ever accuse me of bestiality again, I’ll castrate you on the spot, so make sure you uphold those duties properly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chilon blinked beneath his helm, thrown off by the complete lack of change in tone as his fellow sage delivered her threat, before his attention was taken by the king’s arrival. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, what a beautiful day!” Rufus said with a far bigger smile than Cornelia was used to seeing on his face. Well, aside from when he was busy with his “dancers”. He turned his attention towards her almost immediately upon seeing her, eager for approval. “How do you think it went? They were cheering for me, certainly, but do you think it was genuine?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course it was, my king. You did a wonderful job out there,” she praised, ignoring the noise of disgust Chilon made. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thankfully Rufus didn’t notice, still near-euphoric from his success. “Ha! Ah, what a wonderful day! Thank you, Cornelia! I couldn’t have done it without your guidance!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t wrong about that, but Cornelia knew when to preen and when to demure. “You give me too much credit, my king. The people are merely seeing the charisma you have always had.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That and the slight alterations she’d made to help his mood and keep him from being so melancholy and guilt-ridden all the time. Sure, some may call that “drugging his food”, but she preferred to consider it medication for his ills. She was posing as a healer, after all, so she knew what she was talking about.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They are, aren’t they?” He laughed, unable to hide his delight. “It won’t be long now before the people adore me far more than they ever did Lambert! Though, right, we still need to get rid of Dimitri. Have you killed him yet?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cornelia giggled. “Aw, how very vicious, my king~. Do remember we need a reason to be rid of him first though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, right…why not use Patricia then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cornelia paused. “Oh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Patricia. Through her, Dimitri is related to that Adrestian princess. We’re already stirring up aggression towards Adrestia, we can frame the Tragedy as purely her plot to put the Kingdom and the Empire under the reign of her two brats.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm…that is an interesting starting point, my king. I will keep it in mind for our plans going forward.” It would be an interesting point to follow. Long dead Patricia could work very well as a scapegoat in many respects, particularly if they leaned on Arundel as a conspirator murdered to keep the secret. Or perhaps an innocent victim of his sister’s diabolical plots? Either one could work, but the main point was to turn Faerghus even further against Adrestia. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Poor Thales’s grand design was faltering ever since his little project diverted from his plans, wandering away without his stern hand to hold her leash, so it was up to Cleobulus to set things right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If the people of Agartha could not have their Flame Emperor, then she would give them a Storm King.</span>

  <p>
  <span>"Thank you for coming here. This month's mission is of grave importance," Rhea stated with utmost seriousness as she looked at the professors before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It definitely seems like it if we're getting the mission together," Manuela noted, glancing at Byleth and Hanneman. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We will do our best to accomplish whatever mission you have for us," Hanneman said as Byleth nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you. Now then, normally this mission would be one given to the knights. However, thanks to everything that happened with Tomas and the Flame Emperor, I tasked them with scouring Fodlan to find any leads on them. As such, the mission will have to fall on your students." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What exactly is the mission?" Byleth asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The Almyran army is invading, and House Goneril has requested assistance. From what we were told, it's likely the largest invasion force the Almyrans have used." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-What!? Lady Rhea, you can't be serious!" Hanneman exclaimed, astonished at her request. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I know we just had a mock battle meant to simulate war, but sending the students to fight an actual war is a little…" Manuela trailed off, not wanting to finish what she was saying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is with a heavy heart that I give you this mission. I understand that this might be dangerous, but we cannot allow foreign invaders to desecrate Fodlan," Rhea said as her eyes hardened. "If we do not stop them at the Locket, then who knows how far they will be able to get." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Can the other nations not assist?" Byleth asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The kingdom is still undergoing its own turmoil as they replace members of the Western Church, along with their own sudden invasion from Sreng. The empire, however, is making no move to assist, so there is no other choice." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Who will be assisting us?" Byleth inquired, at the ready.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I will be sending what forces I can spare from the Knights of Seiros, as well as whatever the Alliance themselves can spare," Rhea stated, "It is my understanding that Holst Goneril will be leading the defense as well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, the hero of Fodlan’s Locket will be there then,” Hanneman noted, “That does provide some measure of comfort, at least…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How long do we have until we depart?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Only a few days, I'm afraid. You will need to get your classes ready by the third," Rhea responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Rhea, that's not much time at all," Hanneman noted, frowning deeply. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is all I can afford you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Very well, I understand this is a time of crisis.” He sighed, then nodded firmly. “I will do my utmost to ensure my students are prepared for what they might face.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s the least all of us could do,” Manuela agreed, a rarity for her, her voice uncharacteristically serious, “We’ll make sure everyone makes it back safely.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We will,” Byleth agreed, her mind set. If her students were in danger, then she would simply have to end the war quickly.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Claude breathed out a slow, tired sigh as he stared up at the ceiling of the Golden Deer’s classroom. “War with Almyra, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It would be wrong to say he hadn’t seen it coming. The words on the wind made it too obvious something like this was going to hit. Faerghus was busy, Adrestia was selfish, and that left it up to Leicester to try to beat back the “barbarian hordes” of his own countrymen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, you look down. What’s up, Claude?” Hilda asked, plopping down in the seat beside him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, just disappointed Cyril’s addition to our class was overshadowed,” he replied, grinning over at his pink-haired pal, “How about you, Lady Goneril? Feeling happy we’ll get to visit your big brother?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, don’t remind me.” Now it was her turn to pout. “Couldn’t the Almyrans pick a better time to invade? We have the ball next month, I don’t want to get bogged down fighting off invaders with my overbearing brother…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, it probably won’t last a month, so no need to worry about that.” Especially if he was right about who was leading the invasion. Of his half-siblings, Shahid had an excellent mix of vanity and stubbornness that made him a massive pain to deal with, yet also slow to accept ideas like ‘maybe you need more than just numbers to win a fight’. The invasion reeked of his type of grandstanding, which almost made Claude crack a smile before he remembered this time his older brother’s arrogance would result in a lot of people dead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He let those thoughts clear from his head though, instead directing his grin towards Hilda. “Speaking of, do you happen to have a date in mind for the ball? Maybe a certain winged deer who flew off to join the eagles?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilda frowned at him, though he could tell she was amused. “Winged deer? Really, Claude?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? It’s an apt metaphor. Or allegory? One or the other.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, sure. And how about you, huh? Do you have anyone you’re interested in?” she deflected, not even bothering to pretend to answer his question, “Maybe a certain mercenary?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re gonna have to be more specific than that, Hill. Do you mean the mercenary in our class, the future mercenary who’s also in our class, the mercenary that’s teaching, the mercenary that isn’t teaching, the mercenaries in town–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She lightly punched his arm, pouting. “You know who I mean!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do? Hm…ah, I get it. Though don’t you think Shez would get mad if I asked her dad on a date?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re doing what now?” Shez asked, blinking in confusion as she stopped a few feet away from them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh Claude was just talking about how he wants to ask you to the ball next month,” Hilda lied without a hint of shame, fully throwing Claude under the cart in a cruel act of disproportionate retribution.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure, if you wanna.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude blinked. He had to admit, he wasn’t expecting that response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Neither was Hilda. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, why not? We’re buds and it’d probably be fun, right?” She paused, her thoughts seeming to catch up with her. “Wait, no, I’m mad at you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are? For what?” Hilda asked while Claude winced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He poisoned Byleth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?? When did this happen??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude held his hands up when Hilda immediately glared at him. “Hey, it…alright, it was a stupid move I made back before the Battle of Eagle and Lion, I didn’t mean to poison her specifically, and I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hilda blinked. “...Okay, I’m actually more surprised you apologized to me, but also what the heck, Claude? Why would you try to poison anyone to begin with? I thought you were just being weird when you talked about all that poison stuff you’re into.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hilda, did you think making poisons was just my hobby or something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes? Duh? It’s like, I make stuff sometimes, but it’s not like I ever use them to try to kill people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know there’s a difference between poisons and perfumes, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah but it could still mess someone up if I put perfume in their food.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, guys?” Shez spoke up, looking confused, “Are we still on the same topic?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, sorry Shez. Yeah, I guess Claude would be a bad choice for a date then,” Hilda admitted, prompting a huff from Claude.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could still take her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Claude, you poisoned her sister. I’m pretty sure that takes you out of the running for dateable guys.” Hilda paused. “Actually, Shez, what’s your type?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Uh…I dunno? I guess…well rule one, they can’t hurt or threaten my sister, so that means Sylvain’s off the table.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That got Claude and Hilda to pause. “Wait, did he hurt Teach?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no, he threatened her, it was a whole thing. I think he was trying to cheer me up? It’s been a while since then, but I told him I’d kill him if he messed with her so he backed off.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that why you left the Lions?” Hilda asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, partially? I thought I’d have more fun with you guys and I have been so it still feels like a good choice.” She pointed at Claude. “Still annoyed though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right…Is there something I can do to make it up to you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm…make me house leader.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lorenz would kill me,” Claude bluntly stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, true, he would…” Shez tilted her head, as though listening to someone. Something she tended to do when she was thinking, so Hilda didn’t think much of it while Claude watched her with his usual curiosity. “Ahh, that’s a good one…alright, I’ve got it! Claude, hire me to go to the dance with you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude blinked. “...Uh, what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have to pay me to be your date to the dance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He blinked again while Hilda covered a snort, before she started to giggle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So…hold on, you want me to hire you to be my date?” he asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup! You pay for all the fancy stuff too, the dress, the make up, whatever else I need to look like a fancy lady having the biggest date of her life! And, and here’s the important part, you need to fork over the gold in front of everyone there. You pay for me to get ready, then when we meet up at the ball, you pay me directly, there in front of everyone, to be your date, so everyone knows his grace, the great Claude von Riegan, had to pay for a date to the dance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s the most vindictive thing I’ve ever heard of,” Claude stated with awe in his voice, genuinely impressed by the sheer audacity while Hilda outright laughed. “I…Yeah, okay, I’ll take you up on that.” Then he smirked. “Just so you know though, I’m not the type of guy who takes stuff like this lying down.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah, you’re very scary. But hey, if you won’t lie down for me, I’ll just have to slam you into the floor,” Shez teased, before glancing at Hilda, “So hey, Hil, can you help out? You seem like you know what you’re doing with fashion stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooo, I was hoping you would ask~!” Hilda beamed. “Any ideas to start off with?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Whatever makes the biggest dent in Claude’s wallet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, no restrictions at all then~! Awesome!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude sighed, well aware this wasn’t going to end well for him. But, well, he knew there would be consequences for screwing up. Honestly, he was surprised Lorenz hadn’t shown up just from the rumor to demand he step down as house leader…Well, no reason to look a wyvern in the mouth. “Think we can move along now? Maybe focus on the mission instead of the ball?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It won’t save you, but sure,” Shez agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Right, ah…hey, Cyril, what do you think about what’s coming up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think you’re getting what you deserve,” the young Almyran answered from his place a table over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I meant about the whole ‘invasion’ thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't have anything to say. Lady Rhea says we need to defend Fodlan so I will." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? So you don't have any problems with fighting Almyrans?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Should I? None of them probably remember me," Cyril admitted, "Though… I am worried about any kids that might get captured during the battle." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, in that case, let's go squeeze in some training," Shez said with a grin, thankfully turning away from her plans to financially ruin Claude. "You don't have to worry about them if you're strong enough to make sure nothing happens to them!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry, no can do, still have some chores Lady Rhea wants me to handle," Cyril responded, making Shez falter a bit as he left.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well… hopefully the other classes are up for training." </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"I must admit, an Almyran invasion is not an event I ever thought I'd be involved in," Dimitri mused after his class got the news. "I have no idea how we'll fight them…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don’t overthink things, Boar. All we have to do is beat them," Felix said as if it was the simplest thing in the world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And how exactly do you plan on fighting their wyvern soldiers?” Sylvain asked, “Last I checked, unless you're planning on chucking your sword at them, you're not going to have much luck hitting them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They have to fly down eventually, I'll just strike them then." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Still, we should make sure to be careful. We may have had time to train with pegasus knights, but wyverns move completely differently," Dedue pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s right about that,” Ingrid agreed, leaning in to join the conversation, “Wyverns tend to be more aggressive in general. Pegasi will charge at the enemy if you urge them, but wyverns will actively attack whatever they register as a threat to their rider. And that’s not even getting into the ones that can breathe fire.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh wow, I didn’t expect you to know so much about wyverns, Ingrid. That’s really impressive,” Annette complimented, prompting a slight blush from the blonde.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not that impressive. My family’s territory borders the Alliance so we’ll see wyverns every so often. More in the summer than the winter though, they really don’t like the cold.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shame that probably won’t be a factor over at the Locket,” Sylvain pointed out, “Leicester tends to stay warm, right? And we’re only going to start entering winter at the end of this month.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So we probably won’t have an advantage in that sense,” Mercedes notes, “Perhaps I should take up training with the bow again? Archers are supposed to be quite effective against flyers, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Maybe I could be useful this time then,” Ashe considered, though his comment went unnoticed as the discussion among his classmates continued in earnest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, one classroom down, a similar discussion was taking place among the students of the Black Eagles, though with a slightly different tone. And a bit more of a geographical focus.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then the mountains are being the ‘neck’, and the ‘locket’ is being the fortress?” Petra asked, looking at the map spread out over her table in some confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not the fortress, the fortresses!” Ferdinand corrected, “Fodlan’s locket is a series of fortifications designed to prevent any Almyran invader from seizing the throat!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Throat? Oh, it is a throat…why is it a throat?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, I’m not sure about that either,” Caspar admitted, scratching his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Linhardt sighed. “It’s because some people think Fodlan looks like a dragon’s head.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They do?” Hapi leaned over, staring at the map too. “I don’t see it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it not obvious? Here, if you would look southward, into Adrestian territory–” Constance explained, tracing a finger over to Fodlan’s western shore, “–you can find Fodlan’s Fangs! The lower half is where House Ochs sits, while the uppermost is where House Nuvelle once resided!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I am remembering the fangs, yes.” Petra nodded, before tilting her head, trying to make out what actually looked fang-like of the landmass. “...They are meant to be fangs?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course! The Fangs of Fodlan itself!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…do not have understanding. It is looking like land to me.” She tried tilting her head the other way. “...Or maybe lips?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Where are you seeing lips?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“See? This is the upper lip, and this is the lower. Or…jaws? Is jaws more correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well jaws does sound more appropriate,” Ferdinand commented, now scrutinizing the map too. “Hm…actually, what does that make the Bay of Enbarr then? Oh, perhaps instead of part of the mouth, the upper ‘jaw’ would be something more like the nose? Then that would leave Hevring as the upper jaw and the bay as the open mouth!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?! Nuvelle is not a nose!” Constance snapped, oddly offended.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I don’t think that even works,” Hapi mentioned, “Dragons are like wyverns, right? Their nose is part of their upper jaw, like a snout.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hey, wait, horses also have that going on,” Caspar realized, “Does that mean horses are related to wyverns?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Horses are mammals, wyverns are reptiles,” Marianne spoke up, much to her own surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Wait, what’s the difference?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Mammals have hair and give live births. Reptiles have scales and lay eggs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ohhh…hang on, don’t birds also lay eggs?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Y-Yes, but reptiles don’t have feathers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Hey, wait, fish also have scales, does that–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Caspar, you can find this information out really easily if you look in any biology book.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well fine, keep your secrets.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Back on topic,” Ferdinand interrupted, pointing to the map again, “What in the world is this portion of the continent meant to be then? If Nuvelle and Ochs are the fangs, or the jaws as might be more appropriate, what does that make Hresvelg territory?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Maybe a wing?” Hapi offered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dragons don’t have wings on their heads, right?” Caspar asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They most definitely do not,” Flayn affirmed while having a bit of trouble actually seeing the map due to her taller classmates being in the way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see our classmates are taking the impending invasion well,” Hubert commented with some amusement from where he stood with Lady Edelgard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They really are childish sometimes,” Edelgard replied, before sighing, “Then again, I suppose none of us expected a foreign invasion in the middle of the year. Nor for Rhea to decide we should be involved.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is an interesting decision on her part. One might think sending several noble heirs to the frontlines of a conflict with a foreign nation is a poor decision on her part.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It could be, though I think it more likely she’s attempting to foster unity among us.” Edelgard rubbed her chin, thinking. “I wonder if the tensions between Faerghus and Adrestia have shaken her complacency. Especially now that Adrestia is outright refusing to send aid to Leicester.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is a fascinating choice our dear friend the Prime Minister has decided to make. Perhaps certain elements are encouraging his decision-making?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps. We might also be seeing the consequence of Aegir being left to run things. Why would he ever waste the Empire’s military for the benefit of his neighbors? Particularly when, from his point of view, he’ll need that military to handle Almyra if they successfully occupy Leicester.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of Aegir…” Hubert turned his gaze towards the most annoying noble he had the misfortune to know. One who happened to have more information than Hubert happened to be comfortable with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard nodded. “I know. I suppose I was so used to seeing Ferdinand as this obnoxious extension of his father that I never considered he could be an asset to my goals.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That wasn’t exactly what I meant, your highness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know what you meant, and I said what I meant. Ferdinand would be more useful on our side than he would be if there were any unfortunate accidents.” She glanced up at her retainer. “That means no arranging such accidents.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“While I would never want to question your judgement–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t patronize me, Hubert. We’re not in the position to carelessly discard allies. We know who we can’t trust, so when it becomes apparent there is someone we can, we can’t waste the opportunity on paranoia.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And do you truly think Ferdinand is one such trustworthy individual?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think he is the type of person who will have issues with the choices I plan to make, but he is also someone who has seen the ideals he upholds are not being held to. Once he is entirely on our side, he will stay there, no matter what comes.” She looked back towards her classmates and their continued chatter. “Besides, he’s not the first nobleman I’ve known to turn against the father he once idolized.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert frowned at the reminder, but he didn’t have a response. Not one he would be willing to voice while they were still in public. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It truly was strange, having to look at his classmates as potential assets. He didn’t like how open Lady Edelgard was being lately, nor how attached she was clearly getting to their professor. The knowledge that Lysithea was also a victim of those same crest experiments had kept him from leaping to his first instinct to silence anyone who knew of his lady’s torture, but that was an unfortunate consequence of their position. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had to consider who would be beneficial, not merely remove those who would be detrimental. And he did have to give Lady Edelgard credit; she was maneuvering the Eisner sisters quite well into joining their side. Were it not for the professor’s obvious distaste for the church, he would have argued against the idea far more than he had. Still, if he had to, he would take steps to ensure Lady Edelgard’s dream was a reality. Even if he had to remove those in the way of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s strange.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He paused, his thoughts disrupted by her highness’s voice. “What is, Lady Edelgard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think I may have been too focused on Fodlan in my planning,” she admitted, “I didn’t truly consider the foreign powers around us. I know Fodlan has been invaded before, and I can plainly see it happening now, but I didn’t think they might decide to invade on a whim.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Given they’ve amassed such a large army, I doubt it is mere whim driving their leadership,” Hubert commented, though he didn’t truly know anything about the invading force. Perhaps that was more of a concern than he had considered…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lady Edelgard appeared to share his thoughts. “The world is much bigger than Fodlan. I don’t intend to try to change other nations to fit my ideals, but we’ll have to consider foreign policy in the future. Perhaps we should take this opportunity to gain the measure of our neighbors.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert nodded, catching her secondary meaning. Almyra might be an issue down the line, one for diplomacy and perhaps defense against, but the current invasion did give them the opportunity to learn of Leicester while they traveled through it. “I’ll be sure to enjoy the tourism opportunities, my lady.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps you could invite Bernadetta along?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert paused, then raised an eyebrow at his liege. “Your highness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She appears to appreciate your company,” was her reply, which just furthered his confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He glanced over towards where the Lady Varley was sitting with Dorothea, the latter prompting the former into an actual conversation despite Bernadetta’s typical difficulties. Then Bernadetta noticed his gaze, somewhat impressive considering how unaware most people he observed tended to be, and made a vaguely squeaky noise before ducking her head, something that appeared to amuse Dorothea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Your highness, while I would never question your understanding of a situation–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just consider it, Hubert. For now though, we should start preparing for war.” She smiled ruefully. “It will be good practice for the future.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Traveling all the way from Garreg Mach Monastery to the Fodlan’s Throat would sound to most like quite the difficult journey, considering it involved going from the center of the continent all the way to one of it’s borders. However, with the addition of the Knights of Seiros helping things along, the journey actually took no time at all, in large part because having mages that could warp people shortened travel times considerably.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not all the way though; warp magic was handy, but it couldn’t span an entire continent and they needed individual mages to actually perform it correctly. Even so… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh, why couldn't they have used this when we were traveling in the kingdom before?" Shez complained as she waited for the mages to rest up before they could warp again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, my guess is because you guys weren't as much of a rush," Claude noted, before he lowered his voice. "Though it's also possible they might have wanted you to see the destruction Miklan's gang caused after they got the relic weapon." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...eesh." That would definitely be pretty messed up if it were true, some of those villages were razed to the ground… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Though that's just a guess coming from someone who wasn't even on that mission," Claude noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Still possible…" Shez muttered. It felt like the more she learned about the Church, the less she liked it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, so what exactly are the Almyrans anyways?" Emily asked as she walked up to the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Uh, what?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know, the people we're gonna be fighting, what's up with them?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude and Shez exchanged a glance at one another. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...uh, well they're our neighbors to the east of the Alliance. They've been trying to invade for quite some time," Claude explained, "From my understanding, they're an expansionist kingdom, and we just happened to be next on the list for conquest. Though most of the time it seems they're just causing skirmishes." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Kinda seems like they're going for more than just a skirmish this time,” Shez noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That it does, but there is some benefit to fighting off against a large force." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Duh, a smaller force can communicate better," Emily cut in. "So we're probably going to be fighting people who can't even spread orders around well." At her words, Claude and Shez stared at her. "...What?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I didn't expect you to be one for tactics." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey! I'm just used to fighting in small squads from before I joined the academy!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, our surprisingly well-informed friend here is correct. Not to mention that with a large force, you'll need to worry more about provisions and the like. Doesn't matter how many soldiers you have, if they're all starving then they can't put up a fight." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Might even have some people rebel if the leader is incompetent enough," Emily muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's also a possibility, though I don't think we'll have much of a chance to convince anyone of that mid combat." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…then in that case, we should take out whoever is in charge, yeah?" Shez suggested. "We're used to doing it on a smaller scale, but taking out a bandit leader makes the rest scatter. And even if they have commanders besides their boss, it doesn't matter if they're all busy panicking and can't get the word across." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Starting to think I shouldn't even bother with planning if you two want to be in charge of tactics," Claude jokingly said. "Though, you're not wrong." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Elsewhere, Byleth sat at the edge of the group, keeping an eye out just in case while they waited. They should be relatively safe in Alliance territory, but “relatively” was the key word there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, may I have a word?" Glancing over, Byleth saw Mercedes approaching. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course," she responded, gesturing for the tall blonde to sit next to her. "What did you need?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I… wanted to apologize," Mercedes said, a sad smile on her face. "I believe my little brother has cause you many problems." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You have a little brother?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, my little brother Emile. Though you met him under a different name. Jeritza." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Oh." Eyes widening, she stared at Mercedes. "...huh, thinking about it, I can see the resemblance." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We both take after our mother," Mercedes responded with a smile. "Though I was unaware until recently that he was indeed my brother." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...There's no need to apologize."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nonsense professor, I may not know how he ended like he did, but he is still my little brother. Though I imagine you know how that goes, having a little sister of your own." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm. Were you separated from him?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, about thirteen years ago. My mother and I left the Empire where we moved to the Kingdom." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's a long time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is…Professor, if I can make a request? If there's ever a chance, would you allow me to speak with him?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...If I can," Byleth agreed as her mind started to wander. What if she had been separated from Shez for years…what if she had never met Shez? How different would their lives be… "From one older sister to another, if I can help you, I will." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, professor,” Mercedes replied, a soft smile on her face, “I don’t know if I will be able to turn him away from the path he’s on, but I would like to get the chance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded to that, before noticing the bow the older student had slung over her shoulder. “Do you plan to use that against the Almyrans?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, yes. I believe the commonly held wisdom is that flying mounts can be felled quite well by arrows, and I do have some ability with a bow. Not much, but some.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could help you practice,” Byleth offered, “I wouldn’t call myself a markswoman, but I know what I’m doing enough to train.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, really? Well…heh, I suppose I can accept. Though I will have to decline if you are asking me to join your class. I would feel bad about leaving my friends behind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s fine. I have a lot of students right now.” She paused, tilting her head in thought. “Though I wouldn’t say no to gaining more. I would win most class events by default if I had every student in my class, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mercedes blinked, then giggled. “I think there may be a rule against that, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There isn’t. I checked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Really? That feels like an oversight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I don't think I’m allowed to poach the house leaders themselves, but anyone else is fair game. I can even recruit faculty if they’re willing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my…not the other professors though, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “There’s no rule against it. Though… thinking about it, I don't think there's any more class events aside from the white heron cup next month." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh…" And a moment passed between the two as they both imagined Dimitri and Claude having to be the ones dancing for the cup. “...Professor, please don’t do that to them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It would be funny.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, </span>
  <em>
    <span>please</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>

  <span>“Do you see that, Nader? The Yellow Mountains, the natural barrier between the glory of Almyra and the cowardice of Fodlan.” Prince Shahid gestured with one hand, as though he could encompass the entire mountain range in his palm from the cliff he stood atop. “Do you know what the foreign curs call these mountains, Nader? ‘The Neck of Fodlan’, and the fortresses there are its necklace.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Locket, your highness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shahid paused, then glanced at Nader. “What was that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They call the fortresses ‘Fodlan’s Locket’,” the old general corrected with a slight smile. “The Fodlaners call the mountains their land’s throat, and the forts are its locket.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s what I said. The throat and the locket, of course.” He frowned. “Why a locket?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dunno. Maybe a pun on how they’re locking us off from them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shahid narrowed his eyes at Nader, then scoffed, turning back to their target in the distance. “Save your humor for someone who cares, Nader. Today is my moment of glory and I won’t have it be sullied by stupid jokes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nader tried not to sigh, in large part because he knew the prince would notice if he did. Out of all the royals he had to interact with, the ones that thought they knew better about waging war than he did were always the most annoying. “So is the plan still to just throw all our forces at them at once?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course it is! Don’t think of me as some ignorant noble, Nader the ‘Undefeated’, I understand the flaws of Almyra’s past invasions, and the largest has always been limiting ourselves to simple skirmishes! We haven’t made any progress in our conquest of Fodlan for centuries because we haven’t fought them seriously! Skirmishes and sieges have failed, so it’s high time we cut through this nonsensical stalemate and destroy the entire ‘locket’ outright!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Today is the day we seize Fodlan once and for all! And with my success, I shall most certainly be named king!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nader politely clapped. “Great speech, your highness. You probably should’ve saved it for the troops though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bah, as though I need to give any of those peons any heed. They just need to fight when I tell them to fight! Now, you, soldier!” he said, pointing to the armored wyvern rider beside Nader, “Prepare my wyvern! We ride to war at once!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, what? Wait, your highness–” But Shahid didn’t listen, already walking off and prompting a sigh from the rider. “I’m a general though…why am I getting assigned to a servant’s job?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nader patted him on the shoulder and gave him a reassuring smile. “Sucks to be you. Better get to work or the prince might accuse you of sabotaging the war effort.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The general groaned, but got to it, leaving Nader to his place overlooking the border’s fortresses. Which seemed to be filled with even more activity than earlier. “Heh. Looks like we have reinforcements showing up already…Wonder if I might see you out here, Khalid?”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“When I heard we would be getting reinforcements, I didn’t expect it to mean I’d be hosting the heirs of all three of Fodlan’s nations.” Holst Sigiswald Goneril chuckled as he looked over the three house leaders, the massive heir of House Goneril standing strong and ready in front of the young, future lords. “Well, welcome to Fodlan’s Locket! I’d offer a tour, but we don’t really have time for that. Instead, I’ll just thank you for coming by, and ask if my cute little sister happens to be around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Well that wasn't what Byleth was expecting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you mean Hilda, then she's with the rest of our class," Claude mentioned, getting Holst to look at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, you must be Claude, the new scion of House Riegan! Hilda has written about you. I trust you've made sure to take care of her." For some reason, that last sentence sounded like a threat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, well, I've done about as much as everyone else," Claude responded, being careful with his words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good to hear. Now then, while I know about Claude, I have no idea about the rest of you. I don't suppose you'll care to enlighten me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well this is Hilda and mine's professor, Manuela Casagranda," Claude said, gesturing to the songstress. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A pleasure to meet you~" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My name is Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd, heir to the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus.” The prince bowed before gesturing to Hanneman. "And this is the professor of the Blue Lions, Hanneman von Essar." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is an honor to assist you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I am Edelgard von Hresvelg, future Emperor of Adrestria, and this is my professor, Byleth Eisner." Byleth gave a bow in response to Edelgard’s introduction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eisner, hm? I've heard of your father, the so-called strongest knight in all the land," Holst noted before he laughed. "I would love to go up against him one day." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Unfortunately, he stayed behind at the Monastery,” Byleth answered, “Rhea couldn't send everyone with us." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A shame indeed, but the forces that have arrived are appreciated nonetheless." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where would you have us then?” she asked, deferring to the local commander.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A good question. We’ll want to spread out our forces between the three main sections of our fortress here, then move to reinforce our outposts through the pass. This army is larger than normal, so the odds are we might be dealing with one of the Almyran princes instead of the usual generals.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could you elaborate on that point?” Edelgard requested, “Who are these ‘usual generals’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, looking to learn thy enemy, huh? Well, most often we tend to deal with Nader the Undefeated, who’s led quite a few skirmishes along our borders over the years.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold on, how is he known as ‘the undefeated’ if he’s never actually broken through into Fodlan?” Dimitri asked, confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because he’s never actually been defeated directly in battle, in large part because he knows when to cut his losses and avoid a fight. From my understanding, the title is half-mocking and half-honoring, and he has something of a reputation for being a crafty trickster among his people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The best titles always have a hint of mocking in them,” Claude remarked with audible amusement, before shaking his head, “Never mind that though. Do we know anything about the man leading their army?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not a clue. As I said, I think he might be a prince, but–” Holst paused as a warhorn blared out, and a determined look crossed his face, “Right, we’ll have to cut this conversation short here. It looks like the enemy is coming for us now, so we need to get to our stations immediately. I trust you can all coordinate your forces with ours well enough?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can,” Byleth answered, readily and without hesitation. "I would recommend the Golden Deer be stationed along with you, General Holst. As I've heard you're well acquainted with Balthus, and I imagine your sister would be equally well acquainted with how you fight, which should help her classmates better work with you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And this'll mean I'll be able to protect my sister. I like your logic, Professor." …Well that wasn't what she meant but okay. "In that case, I'll ask the Lions to help with the north, while the Eagles help with the south. Now then, let's go!" </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Hilda! I'm so glad to see you!" Holst said, a wide grin on his face as he pulled his sister into a hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh, come on Holst!" Hilda complained, trying to push him off. "Baltie, help me!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, come on Hilda, you know how he is, just let him get it out of his system," Balthus said with a laugh, not wanting to get in the way of Holst. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's good to see you as well, Balthus. I trust you made sure no one has bothered my sister." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing you have to worry about, but there is a girl over in the Black Eagles she's quite close to," Balthus mentioned with a teasing tone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Agh! No, shut up! We have an invasion to fight off!" Hilda shouted, managing to pull herself free from Holst. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...When I had heard we would be fighting alongside General Holst, I did not imagine he would be like this," Lysithea muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, huh, he seems kinda…” Shez paused, trying to think, “What’s that polite word people use when referring to a weird noble?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Crazy,” Emily offered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It would be eccentric, Shez,” Lorenz corrected, “And though he may have his eccentricities, I assure you, we are in quite capable hands with General Holst at our side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, he looks super strong, so I’m not gonna doubt that,” Shez commented while noting how Raphael headed over to compliment Holst’s muscles, “...Hey, is there any correlation between nobles being eccentric and strong? Because I’m noticing a lot of you tough nobles tend to be complete weirdos.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I am genuinely unsure how to take that,” Lorenz admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It means she thinks you’re strong,” Emily said, idly glancing at the heir of Gloucester, “So you’d better prove her right today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Oh, well I certainly intend to! In fact, do keep your eyes on me today, ladies! For I shall show you the true might of Lorenz Hellman Gloucester!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh great, you two got Lorenz going again,” Leonie complained, before lightly poking Ignatz’s shoulder. “C’mon Ignatz, you’re with me today. We’re gonna put those archery skills of yours to good use!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Huh? Oh, well…yes, we shall! Let’s, ah, win the day!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, that’s the spirit!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with that, it was time to go to war. It wasn’t the first time Shez had fought in a war against an invading nation, but she’d still been young back then and, in hindsight, hadn’t really had context for what was going on and what she was actually doing to help the war effort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This time though, things were more than straightforward: The enemy was the Almyran army, they were coming from the east, and Shez and her classmates, along with the fortress’s garrison, had to beat them back. Simple enough, right?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Yeah, actually, it really was that simple. Which was kind of weird. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez knew her family hadn’t been on the frontlines of the whole Dagda-Brigid war thing, they’d been at the back taking care of the forces that got in further than the main force. Scouts and deserters, in other words. So she knew her experience in war wasn’t really the standard and that there was usually big tactical stuff going on that she hadn’t seen on the main front, which was why it was kind of a surprise that the current invasion seemed to genuinely be a bunch of Almyran forces just throwing themselves at the Locket in hopes that it would break.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is this too easy?” Shez asked in the midst of combat, her swords a whirlwind as she cut through a number of Almyran infantry. She couldn’t really see much of a difference between them and Fodlan infantry, in all honesty; they tended to wear more green and most of them had tanner skin, but other than that they were just kind of the standard pikemen and axemen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that complaining I hear?” Arval asked, their voice sardonic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kind of? It’s just, when I heard Almyran army–” She ducked under a spear thrust and rewarded the pikeman who tried with a cut across the chest that sent him falling into the valley below. “–I thought it would be more…impressive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She frowned as she weaved around another axe cut and shoved her magic sword through the fighter’s face before letting it dissipate and reform in her hand, cutting out the time she’d normally need to pull it free.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I should go after one of those wyvern riders?” she suggested, leaping over another axeman and kicking him off the cliff in retaliation, “They seem more interesting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, you could settle things even faster were you to simply use my power to aid you,” Arval commented as Shez started looking for one of the riders in question. Not that it was hard to spot them, there were plenty in the sky right now, it’s just–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, dang, I think Ignatz just killed another one,” Shez noted with a slight pout, “Maybe I should learn how to use a bow?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Or, consider this: you utilize the unique power I have granted you to destroy this entire army.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I’m that strong,” she replied, before dismissing her sword so she could launch a ball of mire into the midst of an enemy squad, the poisonous magic erupting outward and sending more than a few of them to the ground, writhing in pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are. Believe in yourself, partner,” Arval encouraged, “Or more specifically, believe in the power I grant you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I think I can handle it myself, I don’t need–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez? Are you talking to yourself?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then glanced over at a familiar blond in blue. “Oh hey Dimitri. Just, you know. Chatting with the voice in my head.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bloodied prince blinked. It didn’t look like his own blood, so Shez wasn’t super worried. Actually, thinking about it…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shouldn’t you be in the southern part or something? Why are you over on our side?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I should be in the northern section of the Locket, because that is where my class was assigned. And I am in the northern section. I’m not on your side, you’re on my side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. To be fair to me, I was distracted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“With talking to yourself?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes. Uh, anyway, see you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re terrible at keeping secrets,” Arval chided as Shez sprinted off, heading towards the nearest important-looking guy in green.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I wouldn’t have slipped up if you didn’t keep chatting in my ear!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were talking to me though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was talking to myself!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Same difference.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez huffed before jumping up and trying to kick the bearded wyvern rider off his mount. Keyword being “tried”, since the scarred old guy actually batted her back with the flat of his axe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well well, looks like I’ve got a challenger today,” the rider said with a grin, “You think you’re good enough to defeat the Undefeated, kid?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “Oh! You’re the guy! The Nardel guy!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Do you mean Nader?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! That! The enemy commander!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Well it’s good to hear my reputation still precedes me, even if you got the name wrong the first time. Though, knowing what you know, do you still want to go up against me, girl?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hell yeah I do! Beating the unbeaten sounds like a fun idea. Plus it’ll boost my reputation a whole lot and that’s always good to do in the mercenary business.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re a mercenary, huh? Well, don’t say I didn’t warn you.” He grinned, before his wyvern fully lunged for Shez, its jaws snapping right where she would’ve been if she hadn’t vanished in a flash of purple light. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nader had a moment of his eyes to widen before he turned and caught her blade on his axe, the grin on his face getting all the bigger when he noticed the young woman on the back of his wyvern. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Interesting trick!” He shoved backward while urging his wyvern to twist, knocking the girl off balance while he swung his axe towards her head. She ducked, much to his amusement, before yelping when his wyvern bucked and sent her back to the ground. “But not one I’d recommend trying again! Wyverns get testy when you hop on them without permission!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To punctuate his point, his wyvern swung its tail at her, catching the girl in the chest and sending her across the ground with a pained grunt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ow, ow, ouch, that might’ve been a rib,” Shez muttered to herself as she pushed herself back up, “Getting hit by a wyvern sucks, good to know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, enough of this,” Arval complained, definitely annoyed, “Use my power, now, or this man is going to beat you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You good to keep going, girl?” Nader called out, grinning at the stubborn glint in the young woman’s eyes. He could always appreciate someone willing to give it their all, even if he had a reputation to uphold.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You bet, old man! This isn’t enough to put me down!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t help but laugh. And here he thought this battle wouldn’t have any fun to it. “Alright then! Ready or not, here I–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he raised his shield, catching the arrow that was going right for his head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry to interrupt,” Claude apologized as he stepped forward, another arrow already nocked, “I was just looking for my wayward classmate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey Claude!” Shez grinned, whatever annoyance she might’ve felt at having her fight interrupted fading when she noticed her friend. “You know I didn’t need the rescue, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh I know, I just need to make sure you actually remember what we’re here for. Nader, there isn’t the priority, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He isn’t? But he’s the Unbeaten guy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Undefeated!” Nader called out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but he’s not actually the one we’re supposed to take down,” Claude explained, “That would be Prince Shahid, who’s on the other side of the valley, and who I’m pretty sure Teach is already getting towards.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh, really?” Shez shrugged. “Well that’s fine, Byleth can have that prince guy, I want to fight Sir Undefeated over here.” She paused. “Hey, is Undefeated your actual surname?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is, actually!” Nader answered, his amusement growing because he fully recognized Khalid, along with noting how protectively the young prince-in-hiding was standing by that ‘friend’ of his. “If you earn an epithet in Almyra, it’s basically your surname from then on. Otherwise you would just go by a patronym, such as Nader, son of Nazim, or even by your home city’s name.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh really? Huh, that’s kind of neat. So I guess I would be Shez, daughter of Jeralt?” Shez tilted her head, her attention now caught by this subject. “Hm…would it be the same as how noble houses use von? Like Lysithea von Ordelia?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds about right, sure! Though we use ‘al’, not ‘von’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahh, makes sense! That’s pretty neat, huh Claude?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude, meanwhile, was trying his best not to sigh, especially with how much amusement Nader was already radiating. “Not to interrupt the cultural exchange, but we really should be getting back to the fight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah, we should.” Shez straightened, a grin on her face as she pointed her sword towards Nader. “You ready, old man?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, I’m good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then her grip nearly faltered as she blinked. “Huh? Wait, you’re good?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup. I know when the odds are against me, and it feels like the tide of battle is already turning here. Besides, I’d hate to get in the way of young love.” He grinned. “See you around, kids!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with that, his wyvern took off, soaring into the sky far faster than Shez expected. “...Well damn, I guess he really does run when things get tough. That kind of makes the ‘Undefeated’ title lamer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I suppose, but I figure it’ll just make it all the more satisfying for whoever finally beats him,” Claude commented, before glancing at Shez, “So how are you doing? You took a nasty hit there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I’m fine, I heal quick–Oh! Never mind that, come on! We gotta go get to that prince guy!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude blinked, then felt a grin come to his face at his ridiculous classmate’s immediate turn. “I thought you were fine leaving it to Teach?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was when I thought I could beat the Undefeated! Now we gotta go beat the prince guy or she’s gonna get ahead of me again!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Amazing logic. Alright, let’s go kick the crap out of Shahid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, let’s!” Shez agreed, before grabbing Claude’s arm and pulling him along, looking far too excited at the thought of taking down the enemy leader and kind of forgetting how many troops would be between them and him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, Claude was willing to indulge her whims. He owed his older brother a few good hits too, at the very least. Assuming the jerk even recognized him.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>So Shez heard voices too. Huh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri should probably be focused on the battlefield and not so much that sudden revelation, but by this point in time he had already discovered the benefits of multi-tasking and, as such, could focus half his attention on cutting through the foes in front of him, and half on the surprising discovery that he wasn’t alone in hearing voices. It was a strangely comforting thought, though one that was largely being drowned out by those very same voices he always heard, which were clamoring all the louder at being in the midst of combat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Enjoying yourself, boar?” Felix sneered as he cut down a soldier near him. “You look happy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not for the reason you think, Felix,” Dimitri replied, before pointing his spear forward, “Lions, push forward! We’re breaking through the enemy lines!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Got it!” “Understood!” Sylvain and Ingrid replied together as they rode their steeds into the enemy infantry. Sylvain’s destrier crashed through the Almyran’s offensive line, scattering footmen before he crushed what archers there were so Ingrid could swoop in and run through one of the enemy commanders with her own lance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t the only pegasus knight in the sky going up against the Almyran wyvern riders, though she was the only one in Faerghus blue instead of Leicester yellow. Thankfully, their backline of archers were keeping most of the Almyran wyverns at bay, when they weren’t being shot down outright. Ashe and Mercedes were certainly helpful in that respect, as were the archers from the other houses. There was a slight concern about where the bodies of those wyverns would land when they were shot down, though Dimitri was fairly certain no one on their side had been crushed yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t say the same for one unfortunate Almyran who was outright flattened by a wyvern corpse landing on top of him. Curiously, he was pretty sure he heard someone shout something about a “twofer” at that moment, though he wasn’t completely certain if he heard right. It didn’t sound like one of his voices, but…well, never mind that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the present moment, they were pushing through the enemy well enough, with their cavalry leading the charge and Dedue at his side to help push forward with a massive shield that barreled over anyone in the heavily armored Duscuran’s way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, looks like we’ve got this outpost recaptured!” Sylvain called out from up ahead as they seized another stronghold, “Ingrid, any eyes on the enemy commander?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think so! I can see a man in gold fighting against Edelgard and Professor Eisner!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri paused at that information, then quickly started moving in the indicated direction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey! Where are you going, boar!” Felix called out after him, though Dimitri didn’t slow his pace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If we can end the fight now, we should! Keep the outpost secure, I’m going to back up the professor and Edelgard!” he shouted back while hurrying onward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Edelgard had to say that her first meeting with Almyran royalty wasn’t really going well for future diplomatic prospects. Not because she was opposed to turning a former enemy into an ally, but… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh, how dare you filthy worms aim your blades at the future king of Almyra!" The apparent prince scowled, swinging his axe down at them as he flew by. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Surrender now! Your forces are being defeated all across the pass, there is no chance of you winning!" Edelgard called out, dodging his strike as she raised her shield to block arrows from a different rider. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Swine like you should be silent! You shouldn't even be here! I was told there would be no reinforcements from the kingdom or empire!" the prince yelled, almost making Edelgard drop her guard in surprise at what he said. Who in the world had given him that information?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He's not making this easy…" Byleth muttered, getting Edelgard to focus. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"His guards certainly aren't," Edelgard responded, looking at the two archers on wyverns with him. "Perhaps we shouldn't have gone on ahead without proper long ranged support." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're the one who decided not to stay behind." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if I would allow you to fight on your own." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That prompted a small smile from Byleth before she moved behind Edelgard, who deflected another arrow shot with her shield. “Right, those two need to go. I might need you on defense. Can you keep me covered?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Certainly,” Edelgard replied, her eyes moving to track the wyvern riders circling around them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great. When he gets low again, we’re going on the attack.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Understood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Filthy barbarians…I’ll take your heads myself!” Shahid snapped, urging his wyvern into a dive at the two women, only for the white-haired one to charge straight at him. His eyes widened at the audacity, but he was still covered–Then a pair of thunderbolts crashed down on the generals guarding him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth took advantage immediately, swinging the Sword of the Creator out and using the whiplike sword’s reach to cut straight through one of the armored guards before directing her attention to the second as Edelgard leapt and slammed her axe straight into Shahid, who just barely managed to bring his own axe up so she didn’t fully cleave into his chest. As it was, he went crashing to the ground as his wyvern continued to fly, the scaly beast not noticing it lost its rider until about a second later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To its credit, it did whirl back to try to retrieve him–Only to notice Byleth further electrocuting the second wyvern archer until both he and his mount collapsed in the dirt. Then Byleth turned her attention to the wyvern, who felt a sudden chill go up its spine before it elected to settle on the ground and chirp to show submission to the greater dragon in front of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh. That’s different,” Byleth noted, before glancing at her student, “Good work. Is he dead?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“G-Ghh…it will take more than that to kill me!” Shahid growled as he pushed himself to his feet. The prince was scuffed and dirty, but he still held his axe in hand and looked determined to keep going. “You ignorant wretches! Do you have any idea who you’re up against!? I am the Great Prince Shahid of Almyra!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good to know, your highness,” Edelgard replied, her tone only slightly mocking, “Then allow me to introduce myself in turn. I am Edelgard von Hresvelg, the Imperial Princess of Adrestia. I do hope facing another royal might soothe that wounded ego of yours before I take your head.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shahid blinked. “...You’re a princess? No, that can’t be right! You Fodlaners would never send one of your royals to fight! You’re too cowardly!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And yet, here I am. Now lay down your arms and submit to capture or else ready yourself for death–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was when Shez drop-kicked the foreign prince in the face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked at the sudden flash of purple before recognizing the younger Eisner sister, who kicked off of Shahid’s face in a fairly well done backflip, landing solidly on the ground while he crashed into the dirt with a pained grunt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woo! Got him!” Shez turned, pointing directly at Byleth. “You see that, By! I took out the enemy commander! I’m the older sister now!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...We’re still doing that?” Byleth asked, “I thought Manuela proved you were younger–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t count! Honor the bet!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth sighed. “Fine, you’re older.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“YES!” Shez pumped her fists with a huge smile on her face. “FINALLY! VINDICATION!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s not what that word means,” Edelgard commented, honestly baffled by…whatever that was supposed to be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, I’m sure it’s fine to let Shez celebrate, right?” Claude commented as he walked up, keeping an eye towards the sky for any potential ambushes, “So, you got the guy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I got the guy!” Shez confirmed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then I guess that makes the Golden Deer the winners this time around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard sighed, pressing a hand to her face in exasperation. “You can’t be serious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As serious as a snake in a box. And that’s not even including how Shez here went up against Nader the Undefeated. I’m pretty sure that makes her the most valued participant for today, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused. “You went up against the Undefeated?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, yup, I did! Well, we did, Claude kinda helped,” Shez confirmed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Did you beat him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ehhh…it was a tie.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t say that. I’m pretty sure I was winning by the time your boyfriend showed up,” Nader commented, prompting everyone to turn towards the Almyran general, who grinned down at them from atop his wyvern. “In fact, didn’t Azi here beat you? I seem to recall her tail knocking you out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I wasn’t knocked out!” Shez protested, frowning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Knocked you over there. Either way, I wouldn’t count it as a tie.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you need something, Sir Undefeated?” Edelgard asked, keeping a firm grip on her axe as she readied herself for another fight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That I do. As much as I agree the boy here made some poor decisions, he’s still a prince of Almyra, and the king would get real annoyed with me if I didn’t come back with him,” Nader explained with a grin, “So, if you wouldn’t mind letting me take him back…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. I wouldn’t say that decision is up to me. I am here to help fight off your invasion, nothing more.” She glanced over at her fellow house leader. “What would you want to do with him, Claude?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh wow, you’re actually deferring to me? Never thought I’d see the day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you’d rather mock me, I wouldn’t mind going with my original plan of taking his head.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, no, you’re right, I should take this more seriously.” Claude stepped forward, keeping his bow still in hand. “So, Nader, you promise to call your men off if we let you take the prince?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure I will. This attack of ours was Prince Shahid’s plan, so I’m not interested in carrying on his work when I could just take the brat–ah, the prince, home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That seems rather lenient for someone who decided to invade another nation,” Edelgard noted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Returning in disgrace after failing to make any gains while also wasting time, resources, and manpower isn’t exactly kind to him either.” Nader grinned. “It also puts the blame on him for returning back a failure instead of making him a valiant prince who fell in battle against the cravens of Fodlan. Which would demand an actual response from our king.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I imagine he’s gotta be at least slightly more competent than his son here,” Claude commented, prompting a laugh from Nader.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would sure hope so!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Very well then.” Edelgard still kept her axe in hand and her shield up, but she took a step back and settled, letting Nader set his own wyvern down so he could grab the unconscious Shahid by the scruff and set him on the saddle, before taking a horn and blowing it three times, the sound echoing through the pass as the Almyrans registered its meaning and immediately broke off from whatever fights they were in the middle of, only striking back if any of the Fodlan forces tried to hit them while they all moved to retreat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, see? That settled pretty nicely,” Claude said with another grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t it? Anyways, I imagine I won’t be seeing most of you around after this, considering you’re from further west, but if I do, I’ll make sure to say hi,” Nader said as he climbed back into his saddle. “Oh, and hey, you, Riegan kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude paused, raising an eyebrow. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nice choice in ladies.” And with that, Nader took off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well, he wasn’t what I was expecting when I heard of an undefeated Almyran general,” Edelgard commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Were you thinking he’d be some wild savage?” Claude asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I thought he would be more serious. More like an Adrestian general, essentially…though I suppose I could compare him to Count Bergliez and see some resemblance…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. I think he’d take the comparison as a compliment. Maybe not the ‘serious’ part though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, he did seem quite casual for an enemy general. And notably interested in your love life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, he was just joking. Not something anyone should take seriously, right Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, I can talk now? I thought you guys were still having a royal discussion thing,” she said, pushing herself up from where she’d decided to sit down on the ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that why you were being quiet?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Course. Gotta let the nobles talk when they’re being all serious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a decent rule, avoids causing offense,” Byleth explained as she walked up, standing in between Shez and Claude, before making a very obvious “I’m watching you” gesture towards Claude, much to his obvious concern and Edelgard’s equally obvious amusement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose that's fair. Though I must say, this force was easier than I expected. It goes to show how lacking the enemy will be if they have a weak commander," Edelgard noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, they likely would have been more trouble near the start of the year, but you've all grown strong. Especially you, Edelgard. I wouldn't be surprised if you could take me in a fight now." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Th-There's no need for flattery, professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, bet you're happy you have my permission, huh Edelgard?" Shez teased, grinning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Permission for what?" Byleth asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh you know, just something that only a family member can give," Claude said with an amused grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please be silent, Claude," Edelgard grumbled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dimitri, meanwhile, came to a stop in the empty clearing right on time to see…whatever he was seeing going on between the Eisner sisters and his fellow house leaders. “...Er…is the battle over?” </span>

  <span>Holst sighed. “Balthus, my old friend, the world never turns out the way you expected it to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah, that’s a heavy way to start this conversation,” Balthus commented, raising an eyebrow at his friend as they sat together in the Locket’s dining hall, two mugs of mead set on the table for them. “What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s Hilda, Balthus. My adorable little sister is growing up.” He sighed deeply. “And worse, she has someone she’s interested in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you mean Marianne? Yeah, I noticed those two hanging out a lot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, it’s extremely obvious.” He sighed again. “It’s a problem, Balthus. And one I don’t know how to solve.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, what? How’s it a problem if Hilda likes another girl?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, not that part. The part where I had an entire speech ready for whoever Hilda wants to marry! I was going to make it clear to any suitors that they would have to beat me in a fight if they wanted her hand, but have you seen Marianne? I would feel like a monster trying to fight a girl like that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahhh, I see the problem now. Yeah, you would look like the worst kind of asshole if you tried to fight her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right?!” Holst sighed, even deeper. “Here I thought I would get to have the fun of terrifying some young upstart, but instead Hilda winds up falling for a sweet, shy girl who loves animals! Which, yes, I can understand why that would happen and it warms my heart to see her stepping up to take care of her, but it completely threw off my entire plan!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t that a good thing? At least you’re sure she’ll be with someone who won’t hurt her, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is, but still…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…well, think of it this way. If they do get married, you’ll have two sisters to spoil.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Holst paused. “...Balthus, you’re a genius.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hell yeah I am! Here, let’s drink to celebrate! You’ve got the next dozen rounds, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, my friend! Let’s drink the night away in celebration!”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Well, this was certainly an unusual experience,” Hanneman remarked as he stirred his tea. The crest scholar sat with his fellow professors at the moment, going over their recent experience in repelling an invasion and making sure their students had all made it out fine. Which they had, thankfully. “While I’ve had some unusual missions assigned in my day, this is the first I’ve had to aid in fending off foreign invaders.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is certainly something,” Manuela agreed with a frown, “I don’t know what Lady Rhea was thinking, sending these kids out to face an entire force of Almyrans.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not just a mere force, Manuela, the largest army the Almyrans have fielded in generations.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She frowned. “Yes, I know, you don’t need to correct me, you pompous pedant.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?! I was merely adding onto–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How much longer are we planning to stay here?” Byleth interrupted in hopes of cutting off the argument before it could start.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, well, er…I believe the plan, according to General Holst, is for us to remain in the area for at least three days to ensure the Almyran army really has retreated and isn’t simply setting up for another attack,” Hanneman explained, “While they did take significant losses, he does believe they might have enough of a force to potentially mount a second attack if pushed into it, so keeping on guard and nearby for a time would be reasonable.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really though, we should take this as an opportunity,” Manuela added, smiling again, “After all, here we are in the Alliance, why not take this time to let our students explore? While my class might originally come from here, your two classes are filled with students foreign to Leicester, so why not let them look around, hm?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… I can see the value in that suggestion, though we should make sure only some go around at a time, in case the Almyrans do try to attack again," Byleth noted. It probably wasn’t a big concern, but there was still the possibility. Especially considering that prince’s wyvern had been following her around until she asked the Leicester guards to take it in. For all she knew, Shahid would want it back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We should make sure they're being careful as well,” Hanneman added, “The last thing we need is for them to get lost in a city they know nothing about." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Hm. Byleth should make sure Shez didn't go wandering around; knowing her, she might end up getting lost in Almyra. Though, now she was wondering what her 'older' sister was doing now.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"And there they were, exhausted as they fought against the Almyran Prince and his horde of Generals, fighting tooth and nail yet in need of a rescue! Which is when I arrived, striking a blow on the prince, and getting the Almyrans to retreat in an attempt to rescue their prince!" Shez boasted to the crowd of classmates listening to her as should stood atop a table in the locket’s mess hall. "Even the Undefeated turned tail at the sight of me!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wow, I knew you were impressive, but I didn't know you were that strong," Ignatz said, marveling at her story. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Isn't that Undefeated guy someone who always runs away though? Doesn't sound that impressive to me if he’s the type to always flee," Emily commented. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Doesn't that mean he ran away cause he thought he was about to be defeated?" Ashe suggested. "From what I've heard, even General Holst thinks of him as a rival." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really?" Shez asked, a bit surprised. "Does that mean I'm as strong as Holst?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That prompted a laugh from Hilda, who was sitting beside Marianne as one might expect. “Sure you are, Shez. Why don’t you go ask my brother to spar so you can prove it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, that sounds like a great idea! Where is General Holst anyway?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it General, or Lord Holst?” Ignatz asked, though his question was ignored as Hilda shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s probably drinking with Baltie. I’m pretty sure I saw those two go off together earlier and that means they’re for sure gonna do something stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They might be, um…c-catching up?” Marianne suggested, looking a little worried to be speaking up at all amid all the other students, “Th-They’re good friends, r-right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, best friends for years now, and that means I know what I’m talking about when I say they’re going to do something stupid now that they’re together again. Probably some big celebration or something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like what we’re having?” Ashe asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, we’re just hanging out. I’m talking about doing something dumb like rushing off to take out an entire bandit camp with just their fists to prove that they can. Oh, or trying to wrestle a giant crawler.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, you can wrestle a crawler?” Shez asked, immediately looking interested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can wrestle anything so long as you’ve got the muscles for it!” Raphael declared from further down the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good point!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't go find a crawler to wrestle," Lysithea groaned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure I can win!” Shez insisted, prompting a glare from the shorter girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> go try to wrestle a crawler!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah, you’re gonna wrestle a crawler!?” Caspar asked, excitement shining in his eyes as he overheard them, “Can I join in!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure! The more the merrier!” Shez answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea let out a frustrated groan as she let her head drop into her hands, earning her a pat on the back from Leonie. “Hey, cheer up, I’m sure Byleth will step in before she actually does anything that stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hmph. I suppose…” She glanced at Leonie. “I have to admit, I am surprised you’re not also jumping to try this ‘brilliant idea’. I thought you were all for competitions." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, I am, but I'm smart enough to see how bad of an idea that is. Especially when Byleth finds out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha! Not like she can do anything about it! I took out the enemy commander so that makes me the older sister!" Shez boasted, grinning even while everyone stared at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's a thing her and her sister do," Claude explained, since Shez clearly wasn’t going to. "Since Shez, and by extension the Golden Deer, won the fight, she gets to be the ‘big sister' even if she's way younger." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ooooh, I get it. Maya and I used to do something similar," Raphael said with a laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Exactly! And as the older sister that means I'm the one in charge! Hm, I wonder if that means I'm the professor now…nah, that sounds like too much trouble." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Why did it have to be someone like her?" Lysithea groaned out as she buried her face in her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I must admit, Shez is quite strong, but it is vexing that my skills aren't at her level," Lorenz muttered, completely misunderstanding Lysithea's complaints and getting the mage to groan again. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Dorothea, is everything okay?" Edelgard asked upon finding her friend up on the ramparts, staring out at the pass, "I assumed you would be celebrating with everyone else." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The same could be said for you, Edie," the songstress responde with a tired smile as she pushed herself off the wall she was leaning over. "I thought a house leader was supposed to share in the festivities?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just wanted to get some fresh air," Edelgard lied as she examined the ramparts. If she ever had to take the Locket by force, it would be necessary to know of any weaknesses. Even if it was meant to block off Almyran invasions, it was still a fortress and that made it important to hold.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I guess we can just say I did too," Dorothea remarked, looking out towards the pass again. "You know, I had heard the Almyrans always celebrate a battle, even if they lose, but I didn't think it was true." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Looking out into the distant valleys as well, Edelgard could hear faint revelry happening beyond the pass. If it was able to reach them from there, then it likely meant the celebration was a loud one.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I don't quite understand why they do that myself." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I certainly wouldn't be in the mood to celebrate if I was in their shoes. They lost so many people, yet they're acting as if nothing happened. As if we didn't kill however many of their people fighting them off…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yes, it seems they view death quite differently from the people of Fodlan," Edelgard noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. They celebrate dying, while we celebrate killing," Dorothea muttered bitterly, catching Edelgard off guard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Dorothea?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on Edie, you have to see what I mean. Ever since our first month at the monastery, we've had to kill someone on each mission, and even on our 'off month', you and the professor ended up having to deal with that stuff with the abyss." Dorothea sighed. "I’m starting to feel out of my depth here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea paused, then looked over at her house leader. “Edie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are out of your depth here, Dorothea,” Edelgard reiterated, her tone even and serious as she faced her friend, “You’re a singer looking for a spouse. I have no issue with your profession or your goal, and I even admire you for taking these steps outside what most would consider your station in life, but you were not trained for this sort of life. By all rights, you should have the ability to achieve success on your obvious merits and live a comfortable life of your choosing based on them, yet we do not live in a world that allows for that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should be able to attend this academy, learn what you wish, and succeed in your goal of finding a wealthy spouse capable of caring for you without being dragged into conflicts where you are forced to kill others, yet you are. I do not think that is fair, yet it is the reality we are faced with. I was trained to be able to take a life. Not only that, but I was trained to send others to their deaths for the greater good of the Empire. This is a field I find myself unfortunately comfortable with, while I can see you are only growing more discomfited with each mission you are forced on. As such, I am willing to offer you an out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Dorothea frowned, but didn’t reply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taking her silence as a go ahead, Edelgard continued. “For all future missions, however many there may be, I am willing to, in essence, assign you to the backline where you will be out of combat. I understand it is not fully my choice in this matter, but I am certain I can convince our professor if–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to stop you there, Edie,” Dorothea interrupted, holding up a hand, “I’m not taking that offer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you certain?” Edelgard’s gaze was unflinching. Intimidating, almost. “You have made it clear that you do not wish to kill. I could spare you of that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You could, but I don’t want you to. I’m not about to let my friends fight without me being there to help them. I might not like killing, but I hate the idea of leaving the people I care about in danger even more." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You really are strong, Dorothea," Edelgard said, turning her gaze away from the songstress. "If I were in your position, I likely would have ran away long ago." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And I wouldn't blame you if you did," Dorothea responded, "But being the emperor means you can't really do that, I suppose." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That it doesn't," Edelgard admitted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But you don't let that break you," Dorothea noted with a smile. "If I were in your position, I likely would have crumbled long ago. Yet here you are, ready to lead us into battle alongside the professor, with grand ambitions waiting for you beyond that. Though for you, I suppose doing away with the nobility isn't that grand, Miss 'it's only been twelve hundred years'."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard huffed at Dorothea’s attempt at imitating her, trying to hide her faint amusement. "If something can be created, it can just as easily be destroyed." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, I suppose so. Especially if you're the one going after it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To Dorothea’s surprise, Edelgard actually chuckled in response to her reply. “You’re kind to say so. I think you are better than I at attaining what you want though…” She sighed, before turning to the songstress with a smile. “I wish you the best of luck in pursuing our professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Of all the things Edelgard could have been leading up to, that was the last one Dorothea could have expected. “Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I understand it may not be the life you were hoping for, but I'm sure-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, wait, Edie, back up. Why are you wishing me luck?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Because I want to see my professor and my friend happy?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That–Edie, I'm not pursuing her, I've been trying to help you and her get together!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"E-Excuse me?" Edelgard asked, very surprised, "D-Didn't the professor say she was willing to take care of you after you left the academy?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That was a misunderstanding!" Dorothea responded, albeit with her cheeks flushing. "I… Edie, you know how the professor is, right? With how she doesn't really emote well at times?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She told me she doesn't understand what romantic love is supposed to feel like. So while those comments might have been sincere, it wasn’t supposed to be romantic on her part," Dorothea explained, "So as it stands, there is nothing between us going on. Especially since, as I've said, I've tried nudging her towards you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...O-Oh," Edelgard mumbled, getting Dorothea to sigh with a slight annoyance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Though I should point out that she also said she has no interest in pursuing romance until the academy year ends, so if you do want to go for it, you'll have to wait." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hm." Blushing a bit, Edelgard composed herself. "...Thank you for informing me of that. Though, if I am being honest, I have no intention of pursuing her. I would prefer not to talk about it, but there are reasons for why we would not work together. So there is no need for you to sacrifice your feelings for my sake." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You know, you’re really undercutting my attempts to help you realize your feelings.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard frowned. “I do not need to…I am well aware of my…f-feelings, it is simply not possible.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, really? So you think there’s no chance at all between you two? Those teatimes you share all the time aren’t evidence she likes spending her time with you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I-I do believe she has also had tea with many students, including you. And I doubt I've ever been able to hold her attention like you did when you sang for her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Which I did because it was her birthday, much like how you got her that pendant, which she's worn every day since." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She has also worn that headband you picked out for her every day as well. Speaking of every day, I do recall you visiting her every day while she was recovering from her wounds, did you not?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You say that as if I was the only one. And if we're talking about that, weren't you the one who carried her all the way to the infirmary?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's because Professor Manuela needed someone to help her!" Edelgard replied, her face getting all the redder. Silence fell over the two for a moment, before Dorothea started to giggle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are we even doing?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...h-hm…I see what you mean. Things have gotten a bit out of hand here. It is quite silly to think that we were just trying to argue that the other likes the professor more." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It really is. Normally in productions, arguments like these usually involve the two girls saying they like the person more. It also doesn't involve said person saying the two girls should get together instead." Dorothea giggled again, her cheeks slightly pink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"E-Excuse me?" Edelgard asked, blushing at the idea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, there you two are." Cut in a new voice, getting the two students to look over and see Byleth coming up the stairs of the ramparts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"P-Professor? Did you need something?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was just checking up on everyone." As she said that, she glanced between the two. "...Sorry for interrupting." With that, she gave the two a small thumbs up, before walking back down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I-It seems our professor might have misunderstood something," Dorothea muttered, her own face warming. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Q-Quite.” Edelgard took a breath in another attempt to compose herself, though, with everything that had just been brought up, she felt her eyes drifting towards Dorothea for a moment and simply…studied her. She really was quite impressive in many respects…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I think that managed to pull me from my funk well enough. Why don’t we rejoin the party?” Dorothea offered, before noticing Edelgard’s gaze still on her. “...Edie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm? A-Ah, yes, we, ah, should rejoin everyone. It is important to be…social,” she agreed before moving to do exactly that and heading back down the stairs at a not quite hurried pace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Heh.” Dorothea giggled, her face warming again as an idle thought crossed her mind. Namely that, well, it wasn’t unusual for Adrestian emperors to have multiple consorts. She wouldn’t bring that up to Edie though, at least not at the moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The poor girl might combust.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Sighing, Emily leaned back in her chair. When she had heard they would be fighting off an army, she had assumed it would be a grand glorious battle where she could soak in the blood of those she slayed. While she was able to do that last part, the battle was also pathetically quick. It didn't help that now she had to wait around in case they attacked again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A part of her was hoping they did, especially since Hilda's older brother and his friend had apparently given themselves food poisoning by eating mushrooms. Less allies on her side meant she was able to kill more! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not like her current classmates were deadweight either. Shez was practically a whirlwind of death, and Lysithea, despite being a tiny mage, had the magic to back up her words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While she would never pursue muscles like that wall of a person did, Raphael also proved himself to be the powerhouse, and while Hilda might not be able to do stuff on her own, she recognized how strong the hidden Agarthan was! Hm… maybe if things did turn sour here, it might be good to pursue a mercenary life like Leonie? The commoner was quite skilled, and she would likely be joining Shez’s group when they graduated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the very least, she had no intention of becoming a knight like Ignatz, especially since that boy, for all his words, didn't seem eager to do so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though would it be better to throw her luck in with a noble? Lorenz was a fool, but he had his uses. At the very least, if she sided with Lorenz, she wouldn't be as much of a target than if she sided with Claude. It was only a matter of time before her people went after the leaders of the respective nations. As smart as he was, there was only so much the archer could do against them…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hello, Emily, how are you doing?" Blinking as she was brought out of her thoughts, she looked over to see Byleth standing nearby. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily sighed, letting her frustration show at the sight of the professor. "What do you want?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wanted to see how you were doing." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And why exactly are you doing that? Last I checked, I'm not your student anymore." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But you were before, and even if you're not, I still want to check up on you," Byleth said, nodding as if it was that simple. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I'm doing fine. There, you happy?" she asked mockingly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I am. I'm happy you've made friends." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That gave Emily pause. Friends? What was she talking about? The Golden Deer weren't her friends, they were just valuable allies she needed in case things turn bad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That gave her further pause. Did she just seriously consider Fodlaners allies? That couldn't be true, they were just…beasts, right? Right, mere beasts who were only of use to her as far as she could benefit from them, of course. The only reason she was siding with them was because…Well, it wasn’t as though she was even siding with them, she was using them. Manipulating them to her own ends, like a proper Agarthan!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…What did it even mean to be a proper Agarthan? Thales was dead, Solon was dead…Was her plan really to just try to hide from Bias? Shouldn’t she at least try to avenge…But, then, did she really care to? The more distance she had from them, the more she couldn’t help but think of how little either of the sages actually regarded her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya knew she should be loyal, but…She was loyal. Of course she was loyal. But everyone she should be loyal to was dead. The thought of working for Cleobulus turned her stomach and while Myson was her superior, she couldn’t stop herself from seeing him as lower after seeing how readily he followed Thales’s orders over the years. He just didn’t feel like a leader.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Did Claude?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you feeling okay?” Byleth asked–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“GAH! W-Why are you still here?!” Emily yelped–</span>
  <em>
    <span>demanded to know</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Because she didn’t yelp, not to some…big-eyed weirdo staring at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You lapsed into silence and made some weird facial expressions, so I was just waiting for you to talk again. You didn’t, so I decided to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That’s weird. You’re weird.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know. So how are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Why do you care so much? And don’t give me that ‘you were my student’ thing. There has to be more than that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I guess there’s something extra.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ah ha, there it was! Ulterior motives! Wait, she didn’t know Kronya was Agarthan, did she? Who would have even told her? Shez? No, Shez was an idiot, she didn’t even know…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I care about you because you were my student. I also care because you’re Shez’s friend. There is something extra though, and it’s that I killed your uncle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My uncle?” …Who the hell was that referring to? Thales? Thales wasn’t her uncle, he was…What even was Thales to her? Ugh, this was so much easier when she could just follow orders and indulge in murder… “Alright, what are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A few years ago, a noble in Enbarr attempted to prey upon my sister and I. His name was Andrei Korsch. I stabbed him to death in retaliation, and I later learned he was your uncle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You stabbed a noble to death in the middle of a city?” Emily asked, a little impressed. Which was probably the wrong emotion to be showing given the confused look Byleth gave her. “...I mean, uh…oh no, my…poor uncle Andros, oh noooo…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Andrei.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, yeah, uh…yeah, okay, sure, you did that. Congrats?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. This is not going the way I expected it to.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well, that makes two of us. I have no idea what you’re expecting from me here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. To be clear, you are not troubled because of what happened to your uncle?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No? Look, professor, I don’t know what you’re talking about and I don’t care. I’m kind of impressed you actually stabbed someone to death in Enbarr and got away with it. That city’s pretty big and populated, though not too hard to get away with if you pick the right location. Where’d you shank him anyway?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...The middle of a busy street.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily whistled, genuinely impressed. “Wow. And you were how old when this happened? You said it was a few years ago, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I believe I was fourteen at the time. Or fifteen. It was…This doesn’t bother you at all?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were fourteen? Huh, that’s…” Fourteen was pretty young for Fodlaners, right? Actually…yeah, that was about a year younger than Lysithea and she was tiny. Oh, or the same age as that new kid, Cyril. “Huh. That is pretty impressive, gotta admit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Thank you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why couldn’t you have led with that? Would’ve found your classes way more interesting if you were focusing on that stuff instead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The purpose of class is to get better at stabbing, not to tell stories about stabbing.” She paused. “And other things. It’s good to get better at many different things so you’re well-rounded and capable.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah, save the lectures for class. Which I’m not in, so ha, no lecturing me for you,” Emily teased before pushing herself up from her chair, “So, you got anything else for me, professor, or are you finished with whatever this confession thing is supposed to be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I suppose so, though, I did want to ask one more question." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, go ahead, get on with it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You seem interested when it comes to stabbing, do you prefer using a dagger?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well duh, but it's not 'proper weaponry' when it comes to fighting, so gotta stick with a sword." Emily said, letting out a huff. "Is that all-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The words died in her mouth as she looked back at Byleth and saw the normally dull-eyed professor staring intensely at her. A moment that seemed to stretch on for an eternity passed, before Byleth looked away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I see. That is all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily watched her leave in visible confusion, then scoffed to herself, trying to ignore the twinge of…not quite fear that had hit her at that strange intensity in her former professor’s eyes. “The hell was that about…?”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"It seems that the commoners of the Alliance are living rather well. While they may not be able to rise to the rank of nobility, the 'merchant class' seems to be a step away from them. One could consider them like the knighthood of Faerghus, albeit with more freedom since they don't need to swear themselves to a lord," Hubert reported to Edelgard after some investigation into the territory surrounding Fodlan’s Locket. With the excuse of “touring the local region”, he was able to gather thorough information at a decent enough pace to report back to his lady in her quarters at the Locket. "However, while the nobility may claim to care for the commoners under their banner, there is a fair amount of tension between all the houses. Be it out of fear or arrogance, they all seek to gain more power for themselves, while keeping the illusion of working together." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, it is something I noticed,” Edelgard agreed, “Most of the Alliance soldiers we fought with were from House Goneril. Not to mention it's been said House's duty to fight off the Almyrans since the creation of Fodlan’s Locket. It may be their territory, but leaving it to just them means that should they fall, the Alliance may be in danger of crumbling.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is a real danger, though one I doubt the lords have considered in full. I imagine if we were to ask them, they would point out that their own forces would be much better suited guarding their own territory than potentially losing manpower in the defense of the whole. I believe a certain Prime Minister I could mention has a similar thread of logic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. And yet, divided, the members of the Alliance would fall completely if a foreign invasion were to get even the slightest purchase within their territory.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Which does make them remarkably easy targets for us,” Hubert pointed out, “Really, this investigation of ours has made it clear the Alliance might indeed be our best target once our war begins. If we can seize or subvert each of the lords along the way and keep them from entering the fray at all, we would completely wipe their faction from the board before the game even begins.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…but is that the best move for us to make?” Edelgard considered, frowning in thought. “...We know from Lysithea that Ordelia is incredibly weak. I don’t want to betray her trust, but if we offered her good terms to side with us, we could leverage that deal to the other members of the Alliance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Edelgard, do remember, our goal is one of conquest. We can’t show mercy to everyone, lest they take advantage of it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I understand, yet… if I can speak with Lysithea and Marianne, then we might be able to get both their houses to side with us without battle. Lorenz's father also favors the empire, among a few other houses. Fighting will be inevitable, but we can at least ensure we keep it to a minimum." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What if they choose not to side with us? Then we have let our secrets be known far ahead of schedule, not to mention that while Count Gloucester might side with us, he is just as likely to betray us should it benefit him, much like Acheron," Hubert retorted. "It is a far safer idea to see where the pieces land once we enact our plans." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Would that not mean they'll be more likely to side against us if we keep them out of the loop until I declare war? We need to ensure we have as many allies as we can before then. The Adrestian military might be strong, but without the support of Thales’ forces, we cannot hope to face off against three major forces, potentially four should the Agarthans decide to rear their heads." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Edelgard, the Leicester Alliance was founded on the principle that they would not bend their knee to a king, nor an emperor. Their founding principle puts them at odds with us. And even if you wish to treat with them, do not forget that they are self-serving in the end. They cannot be trusted to stay loyal to us when they think they could stand on their own. As you said yourself, three major forces allied against us would be a genuine threat. I don’t doubt that any Alliance noble we approach would keep that fact in mind as well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So your thought is that we cannot trust the Alliance nobles not to ally against us, therefore we should guarantee they will be our enemies instead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“An enemy we can eliminate early, yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The people of Leicester are not eager for a liberator, Hubert. If there is a chance we can sway them to our side, is that not better than guaranteeing they will rebel against us?” She held up a hand to hold back his response. “On our present course, we are guaranteed to be fighting a war on two fronts. If we can seize Garreg Mach, that will keep things divided, but it also means our main hope is that the Alliance will not take to the field directly against us in the way that Faerghus is all but guaranteed to. As such, I agree, we should take steps to remove the Alliance as a threat. That doesn’t mean we need to use violence to achieve that end though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert was prepared to argue the point further, and he would have gladly done so, but a knock at the door interrupted their discussion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He frowned, then crossed the room and opened the door. “Hello professor. May I ask why you are here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Hubert,” Byleth replied, nodding to the tall student, “I wanted to speak with Edelgard. Also, I think I should remind you, as your professor, that it is improper for students to be spending time in one another’s bedrooms this late.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“These are guest quarters, professor, not Lady Edelgard’s true bedroom. Besides, I am her retainer. Where she goes, I will readily go as well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Understood. That being said, I need to discuss something with Edelgard." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is it not improper for a professor to also be spending time in a student's bedroom after the sun has set?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It will only be for a few moments." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's fine Hubert," Edelgard spoke before her retainer could. "We should shelve our conversation for later, otherwise we'll just keep going in circles." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Very well, in that case, I bid you a good night." Hubert said, bowing to Edelgard before he left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now then, what did you wish to speak about?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I think I know who the infiltrator is." </span>

  <span>The trip back to the monastery was rather uneventful for the students of the Officer’s Academy, who spent their time chatting among themselves as they traveled together. Turns out since there wasn't a rush like last time, the warp mages didn't have to send them along with magic, which meant they weren’t bothering wasting the effort of getting them back quickly. Thankfully, the Gonerils were more than happy to provide the students and professors with horses for their return; not that Holst was able to see them off since he was still recovering from his food poisoning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Speaking of… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are we sure B isn't dead?" Hapi asked, glancing at the slumped over brawler who was slung over Byleth’s horse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He's still making noises, so he's still alive." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, to see someone so normally full of vigor laid low because of a mushroom. It should have been I who ingested the poison…" Constance mourned, prompting a concerned look from Lorenz.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you certain this behavior is normal for Constance?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As normal as it can be for Coco,” Hapi answered, “Having a ‘sunny disposition’ means something completely different for her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I noticed. Still, it is quite alarming. To think someone could have such enormous changes in personality just based on sunlight…perhaps she wouldn't be a good marriage candidate…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My life is already a burden upon others, there is no need for it to be a burden upon your house as well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hey, Lolo, either keep your foot in your mouth or your head up your ass, don’t do both at once,” Hapi requested, “It’s gross.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–I was merely considering my future prospects,” Lorenz attempted to defend himself, “A peerless mage from a noble house would be an excellent match–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Blah blah blah, keep the pompous bullshit down or I’ll–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, no fighting!” Shez called out from her place in the procession, “Hapi, no threatening Lorenz, and Lorenz, don’t try to flirt with Constance, she’s clearly taken.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She is? By whom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hapi did her best not to sigh, though she did feel her face warm up a little. “It’s fine, Shezter. I'm sure Coco will give him a piece of her mind when we get back to some shade." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, well, regardless, I give whoever courts Constance my well wishes. If she truly wishes to restore her house, then she will require all the assistance she can get." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sometimes I don't know if you're a nice dude or not, Lolo," Hapi muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Speaking of being taken, I heard you're going with someone to the ball," Mercedes mentioned, riding close to Shez. "I don't suppose you'll need help with your makeup?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh? Why would I wear makeup?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, come now Shez, it's a ball! Of course you should make sure to get ready for it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh…yeah you know what, sure, Hilda is already helping me with getting dressed." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh?" That got Mercedes's attention. "Hilda, do you want to help me make sure Shez is ready for the ball?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ooo, sure!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can I join in~?" Dorothea asked as she held onto Edelgard; the young songstress didn’t want to fall off the horse, so the only real solution was holding her highness around her waist. The princess, meanwhile, was doing her best to avoid getting flustered as she held onto the reins. Not that she had much luck when her gaze met Byleth’s for a moment, only for the professor to give her a thumbs up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’d be glad to have you!” Hilda called out, grinning over at the lucky songstress.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"....You three do know the ball isn't till next month right?" Shez asked, though she didn’t get an answer as the fancier ladies started chatting. Sighing, Shez focused back on riding, before noting that they were about to arrive at Garreg Mach. And it also seemed like someone was waiting for them. "Oh, hey dad!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Standing by the gates leading to Garreg Mach, Jeralt grinned, waving at his daughters as the two approached him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there kids," Jeralt greeted, before handing a box to Shez. "Here you go, happy birthday." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A moment of silence dropped over the students as the words he said register–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's not her birthday," Byleth cut in, frowning. "You're early this year. It's on the twelfth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is? Damn it, I overcorrected,” Jeralt muttered, looking annoyed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, don't worry dad, I don't mind," Shez responded, opening the box and finding some beast repellent inside. "Thanks!" And then she immediately extended a hand out to Byleth as if expecting something. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You're lucky I brought it just in case," Byleth muttered, before fishing in her pocket and brought out a necklace. One that had a very…crudely designed horse hanging from it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…did you make this?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I gave the blacksmith the design for the mold." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh. You know what, I'm not surprised." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused for a second, as though listening to something, then frowned. “What is that supposed to mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...It means it’s a really cute, thoughtful gift! Thank you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. You’re welcome.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Pardon my interruption, professor, but didn’t you just say it wasn’t Shez’s birthday?” Lorenz asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did. I tend to bring her an extra gift because pa–Jeralt always forgets. It’s a tradition.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yup! I get a gift from her on my actual birthday, and another when dad gives me his!" Shez explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Why exactly is that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't want Jeralt to feel left out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt sighed. “I’m right here, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You already knew.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, I did.” He sighed again. “Well, how’d it go with the visiting Almyrans?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretty good!” Shez answered with a grin, “I went up against this guy called the Undefeated and sent him running!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh really now?” Jeralt asked, already planning to get the real story from Byleth later, “How about you tell me about that over your birthday dinner?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sweet! Hey, do I get to drink beer this time? I’m the older sister now, so I think I should be allowed to!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>‘Oh, you’re still doing that. Hm…Nah, sorry, you’re part of the Alliance class so you can’t drink by Alliance standards.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t?? Wait, what’s the drinking age for the Alliance?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good question.” And with that, Jeralt turned and walked away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–H-Hey! Don’t walk off! C’mon, you should know the answer to that!” Shez protested as she followed him from atop her horse, who seemed unbothered by all the commotion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...So, just to make sure, her birthday is not for another couple of days, correct?" Lysithea asked Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, so there's no rush." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, it's not like I was going to be in a rush," Lysithea responded, which was a complete lie since the present she had purchased hadn't arrived yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…" Byleth gave her a small thumbs up. "Good luck." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Hmph, I don’t need luck…but thank you though.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>When it came to her birthday proper, Shez grinned widely at the sight of her sister standing by her door, a wrapped package in her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Here you go-" Before she could finish Shez snatched it out of her hands and began to open it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks!" Shez said with a grin, before finally managing to take off the parchment wrapping. Though once she did, Shez could only stare at the book she had in her hand, its purple cover and the symbol on the front making it quite obvious what she was looking at. "Volume four of the magic primer…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Took a bit, but I managed to find it," Byleth said, a small smile on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wrapping her arms around her sister, Shez easily lifted her up in a hug. "Aw, thank you, By!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Let go of me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nope, this is my privilege as the big sister!" Shez replied, grinning as she carried her sister towards the courtyard. "Now come on, I'll get you to your class!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I’m pretty sure we'd be faster if I walked." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nope, I think this works just fine!" Shez responded, amusement evident in her voice as she walked towards the classrooms. Byleth felt her face heat up a bit as the students began to watch the two, though she didn’t bother to break her sister’s grip just yet. She could have some fun, even if Byleth was going to get revenge for it later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are you even doing?" Emily asked, staring in disbelief at the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm thanking By for the gift she gave me!" Shez declared, not noticing how Byleth kept her expression studiously neutral when she noticed the potential infiltrator.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Right, I'm not getting involved," Emily decided, heading off to the Golden Deer classroom while some of her classmates stopped to stare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, I don’t think it’s appropriate to be carrying around a professor,” Lorenz pointed out, though he sounded a little unsure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, it’s fine! It’s my duty as the big sister to carry By!” Shez declared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…see. Hm. I suppose I don’t really have the context for commoner traditions…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that’s not a commoner tradition,” Leonie commented, “Those two are just weird.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know about that,” Raphael said, “I carried Maya around all the time when she asked for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Huh, maybe it’s a sibling thing. Hey Ignatz, you have an older brother, right? Does he ever carry you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Um…no, not that I…hm, actually, I think he did lift me on his shoulders one time at a festival when I was young…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Guess it is a sibling thing then. Hm, wonder if it’s the same for noble siblings…hey Hilda, did Holst ever carry you around?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“All the time, duh. Heck, Baltie carried me a few times too,” she said, pointing her thumb back at the tall student.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, that’s right! Y’know, I probably could still carry you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, no, don’t try. I absolutely refuse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, while that may be allowable between siblings, I highly doubt it would be appropriate for a man of your standing to be carrying a noblewoman like Hilda,” Lorenz commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Uh, Lorenz, you know I used to be a noble, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, that’s not important right now,” Leonie interrupted, “The important thing here is finding out who else has siblings and if this carrying thing really is consistent for everybody!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…suppose that is the topic at hand, true,” Lorenz admitted, “I may have siblings, but I have never done such a thing. Perhaps it would help me form a better relationship with them..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well as an only child, I find this topic riveting, but we did have something planned, didn’t we?" Claude asked, giving his class a grin. "And, not that I mind you being here Teach, but don't you have a class to go to?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Tell Shez to let go of me." At her response, Claude glanced at Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Fine." After she was set down, Byleth smoothed out her clothes, before nodding to the Golden Deer and heading off to her class, prompting a pout from Shez. “Feh. I could’ve kept carrying her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you could carry Teach all day, Shez, but that would get in the way of our plans!” Claude said with a grin, looping an arm over Shez’s shoulders as he led her into the classroom. "For you see, unlike those Black Eagles, we actually bothered to remember when birthdays happen." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, to be fair, Byleth doesn't really bring up her own birthday often," Shez pointed out, defending the other house, before perking up. "So, what do you have in store for me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why just a simple little thing," Claude replied, before gesturing to a table where a bunch of presents were being lined up by their Almyran classmate. "Thanks again Cyril!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I only did it cause Lady Rhea said I should try to get along with you guys more. You did ask Professor Manuela for permission to do this, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are you guys doing?" came the voice of said professor, looking in at her rearranged class. "You do know we still have class today, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course we do, professor, but you see, I actually need your help with something,” Claude said, sidling up to their professor, “I might have accidentally brought some Almyran booze from when we stayed in the Locket, so I was wondering if you could help me safely dispose of it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw what, you're asking her but not me?" Balthus asked, frowning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm, well, I suppose I should make sure that's not in the hands of any of the students,” Manuela replied, staring at the bottle of amber liquid before simply taking it from Claude. “Fine, you have until I return to have your little party." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your work is as appreciated as always, professor!” Claude called out as she left, a clear grin on his face. “She’s not coming back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh she definitely isn’t,” Hilda agreed, before pulling Shez over to the table, “Now come on, Shez! You’d better open my gift first~!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Okay, okay, let’s see what you guys got me!” Shez agreed, happily picking up the present Hilda indicated and getting right to work in seeing just what her classmates decided to get for her. Said present being a resin bottle full of flowers. "Ooo, this looks pretty." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Glad you like it~" Hilda said, smiling as Shez looked over the bottle. "It took a lot of effort to make, so you better appreciate it!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I will!" Shez said, setting it down as she reached for the next present, and finding a rose brooch waiting for her. "Heh, pretty easy to guess who this is from." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, my magnificence shines through even my gifts!" Lorenz stated, quite proud of himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well it's pretty, I'll give you that," Shez responded, opening the next present and… finding a ticket? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's for my family's inn! Feel free to stop by and stay for free when you want to!" Raphael said with a big smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks big guy! I'll make sure to come one day!" Shez replied, giving him a thumbs up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Looking forward to it!" As she pocketed the tickets, she grabbed the next box. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, here I was hoping you'd end up saving the best for last," Claude said, mock disappointment in his voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, well guess I still am," Shez teased, opening the box and finding a jar in it. "Uh, what is it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Poison," he answered, getting everyone to stare at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez in particular had a very flat, unimpressed look directed towards him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, what, did you actually believe that?" he asked, a grin on his face, "I might make poisons, but I'm not going to give one as a gift to someone. Fun fact, there are some poisons that can actually be used to make a medicinal salve, which is what I actually gave you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You gotta work on your sense of humor, buddy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, too soon, Claude,” Hilda commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–...yeah, well, that is actually a medicinal salve. A small amount should help with sore muscles while a bit more can do a lot for scrapes and small wounds.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh…that is actually pretty nice,” Shez admitted. “Thanks, Claude. Though I’m getting you a joke book whenever your birthday comes up.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It already passed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For the next one then.” Setting the salve down gently, she grabbed the next present, and found a bottle inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's an amber sweetener," Lysithea explained at Shez’s confused look. "It’s quite tasty when you want a dish to be a bit sweeter." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You mean I can pour this on stuff and make it taste better?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes?" Lysithea let out a small squeak as she got hugged. "Wh-What??" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Here I thought the food here wouldn't get any better!" Shez said, grinning as she pulled back from the hug as she looked at the bottle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...J-Just make sure not to waste it. It's quite expensive." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Jeez, guess the little lady is winning so far," Balthus remarked with a grin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I-It's not a competition!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure it isn't." Letting out an amused huff at her classmates' antics, Shez grabbed the next gift, which was a rolled up parchment which had… a rather simple drawing of Rhea on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Lady Rhea said I should give you something I think you would like," Cyril explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, thanks Cyril!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It looks great Cyril, I didn't know you liked drawing," Ignatz commented, getting the Almyran to shrug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, well I'll make sure to take care of it," Shez said, smiling as she grabbed the next gift. This one being an actually labeled medicine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ha, after what happened to your sister and Leonie I figured you should have this whenever you actually do go drinking,” Balthus explained with a grin, “Trust me, it works wonders." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Is there any reason why you didn't give Byleth or me this when we were sick?" Leonie asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, I was running low on funds at the time," Balthus responded, getting Leonie to huff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, well I'll make sure to remember this when I can." With that, Shez grabbed one of the last two gifts, this one being from Leonie, which happened to be a bracelet with a charm that looked like an arrowhead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A good luck charm from yours truly," Leonie said with a smile, "Made one for Byleth and the Captain too, but I figured you should get yours first!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, matching charms sound great! Thanks Leonie!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, I guess that only leaves my gift," Ignatz noted, letting out a nervous laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to feel nervous Ignatz," Shez reassured, grabbing the wrapped up gift, and finding… a painting of her, and her family. There she was, pulling Byleth into a hug as Jeralt stood close behind them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I, uh, hope it looks alright, I was mostly going off of simple models–" And Ignatz went quiet Shez hugged him, pulling him in tightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you, Ignatz." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A-Ah, I'm glad you like it," Ignatz said, blushing a bit as she broke the hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course I do! I'm sure the others will love it when I show it to them! You know, you'd probably make a killing as a painter." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-oh, that's kind of you to say, but it's just a hobby," Ignatz responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…Hey, Ignatz, could I learn to draw as well as you?" Cyril asked, looking at the portrait. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I suppose? Did you want some lessons?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It would be nice to draw something like that for Lady Rhea," Cyril admitted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, guess that means Ignatz won," Claude remarked with a smirk, "Not only did you make Shez emotional, but you even got our new classmate interested." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's still not a competition!" Lysithea complained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Letting out an annoyed huff, Emily looked away from her classmates as she sat by herself. She couldn't understand this tradition of gift giving these people did, and honestly, she didn't care to learn. Hearing the chair next to her get pulled out, she glanced to see Shez sitting next to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't do presents," Emily said before Shez could speak further. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I got the feeling," Shez replied, not bothered, "Still doesn't mean you have to sit out of everything." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not, I'm just… thinking about something," Emily said, her mind drifting back to how Byleth had called the Golden Deer her friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, want to talk about it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'd rather not," Emily admitted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, in that case, we won't. That being said, we're still going to hang out," Shez said with a smile as she grabbed Emily’s hand, "So come on, all our friends are waiting." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Our?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah? I mean, unless I got it wrong, I'm pretty sure they're your friends." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...hm." Staying quiet, she got up, and followed Shez to where the classmates were still talking. Well, arguing and teasing more than just chatting. Still, maybe Professor Byleth wasn't wrong… </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Byleth watched from a distance as her sister happily pulled her friends along to the dining hall, where her big birthday feast was about to take place. In particular, she could see Shez was leading Emily by the wrist, chatting happily back at the shorter girl as a look of exasperation showed on the possible infiltrator’s face. Exasperation…and some affection that was obvious to see.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know she is likely a danger to Shez if your suspicions are correct,” Sothis pointed out, floating beside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I know. I…I know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You recall how the other infiltrators targeted Shez in particular, do you not? They wanted her for some foul purpose. What is to say Emily is not attempting to get close to her for a similar end?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t think she is. She’s not that good at manipulation. She’s been running errands for Hilda for a while.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Unless that is a deception.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah…but I don’t know for sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sothis sighed. “You know there is more evidence for it than against. And the princess you favor thought your ideas had validity.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She did. Back in Fodlan’s locket, Edelgard hadn’t denied the idea that Emily might be an infiltrator like Tomas. What she pointed out was that there wasn’t definitive proof. That if they made a false accusation, then they could potentially destroy Emily’s life. That it would be better to wait, see, and make sure, and not act hastily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And if she were being honest…Byleth didn’t really want to accuse Emily. She was her student, even if she wasn’t in her class now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you really think you may be wrong, or are you allowing your sympathy for this girl to override your common sense?” Sothis asked, her voice simply logical, not argumentative.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m leaving her alone because I don’t want to be right. Because she’s Shez’s friend. And I know that’s stupid of me. I just…I don’t want to hurt her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, or Emily? Because, while we do not know the mechanics of how these infiltrators operate, we know that if there ever was a real Emily Korsch, she is more than likely dead so this girl could take her place.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah. Yeah, that’s probably true. And…a part of me does think if there was a real one, she deserves some kind of justice. But I don’t know if that’s true. And I don’t want to hurt anyone just for a maybe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…then I will merely add that you should remember where you found that dark dagger. A person does not draw a blade if they do not intend to use it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm.” And that was another question. Why would she draw a weapon like that down there? The possibilities were unpleasant…but there were also more of them than just the worst case scenarios. “I don’t know what she was planning. I don’t think we can know unless we ask her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth took a small breath, thinking. “We’ll keep an eye on her. And if something goes wrong…we have the divine pulse to make it right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do not use the power I granted you as a crutch,” Sothis warned, “The choices you make should matter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They do. Even if no one else knows about them, they’ll matter to me. And right now…I’m going to trust that Emily is friends with Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Sothis sighed. “That is incredibly sappy, but very well. If you wish to give this girl the benefit of the doubt, I will not argue against it. I merely caution that letting a scorpion on your back may see you stung. People cannot change their natures easily.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t agree with that. I think being able to change who we are makes us people.” She smiled faintly. “I know I’ve changed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. I said they cannot change easily, not that it is impossible. Just make sure to keep those you care for safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Always,” Byleth agreed, before walking towards the dining hall to join her friends and family. She hoped the worries she had would amount to nothing, but if there were ever problems…she would do what she had to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She just hoped she could keep everyone safe…</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The rest of her birthday went very well as Shez enjoyed the rest of the day with her friends. She even received some more gifts from the other houses too! She definitely appreciated the cloak she got from Sylvain in case she ever had to go to the kingdom again. The curry comb she got from Ingrid also made her remember when she talked about being a dark knight… hm, she should try training on horseback again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bracelet she got from Dorothea was also nice, even if it did make her think she was starting to have a lot of accessories. And while she had read ‘Loog and the Maiden’ before, she was happy to have a copy that Ashe gifted her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Seems someone is going to get spoiled rotten at this rate," Arval commented after her birthday dinner with her family and the mercs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shush you," Shez retorted, an amused expression on her face despite the teasing. "It's been a busy year, getting to relax on a day like this is necessary!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, I suppose that is true. Though the year is almost over. Soon enough, you'll be free to journey once more." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…maybe not right away," Shez said, thinking about Lysithea going to the empire. "Gonna have some things I need to check on first." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I imagine you do. Your friend Lysithea will come first, won’t she?” they acknowledged, “She and the crests she was cursed with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah…it’s weird, you know? It feels like crests cause more problems than they fix.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval kept their smile from growing too wide. "Indeed. If they truly were a blessing of the ‘goddess’, then she is a remarkably cruel deity.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh…Maybe? I still don't really care for the church but… I dunno. There's a bunch of weird stuff going on, and there's still those Agarthans we have to deal with…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, there is that matter to address, but for now, you should get some rest, my partner. It is getting late." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I guess it is. Goodnight Arval." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Goodnight, partner," Arval said, smiling as Shez laid down in bed. The smile dropped soon afterward as he considered his vessel, who was far too attached to the Fell Star. If she knew what he was planning, she would fight him. It didn’t matter that her fate was ordained, she would resist it out of a misguided affection, and he could not allow that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And the sage Epimenides, lingering despite having passed from this world long ago, drifted down beside the girl that was his vessel. He could not sit on the bed, though he mimicked the action as he pet his young vessel’s hair. Unable to touch, but trying nonetheless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was flawed, but she was still his.</span>

  <p>
  <span>Yuri Leclerc was many things; most would call him a thief or a scoundrel, though when he was in the Empire, nobles called him quite the songbird. He was rather fond of “boss”, if he had to pick a title for himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But right now…he was bored. He'd never say it out loud, but it was a lot less fun since his fellow Ashen Wolves started hanging out on the surface with everyone else. Sure, they still came back down to Abyss most days, since their rooms were still down there and they had to sleep eventually. Even so, it was quieter. Especially since the only students coming down there were Leonie, looking for things in the scrap pile, or Edelgard and Claude, who kept reading the banned books. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which meant he was often on his own now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Letting out a sigh, he pushed himself up from where he was sitting. Well, if he was bored, he might as well drum up his own fun. With a quick journey up, Yuri found himself up topside. Pretty quickly, he realized it was still pretty early in the day since none of the students were milling about. Given that it wasn't the end of the week, that meant they were probably still in class. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hm…going to the Black Eagles class was the immediate option, but Byleth would likely notice him right away. The Golden Deer was also no good since Balthus would definitely make a ruckus if he spotted him. Which left the Blue Lions as his destination. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was easy enough to find his old classroom, not like they ever moved things around up here, and he casually moved in to sit beside a gray-haired kid who he was pretty sure he remembered from one place or another.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Ah, Yuri?” Well that was a good indicator that the kid knew him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shh, no talking in class,” he chided with a smirk, deciding he could piece together the freckled kid’s identity as things went along.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, sorry.” Polite boy. Cute too. The type who would be the darling of noble ladies looking for an earnest knight to keep them company. He had that sort of boyish look that made him seem honest, which made him an easy mark…though, no, he wasn’t. The kid was keeping an eye on him out of the corner of his eye; not especially suspiciously, but there was an interest there…though, to be fair, Yuri had just sat right beside him out of nowhere. Anyone would be curious in that situation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, was he one of the students Yuri had interacted with on his last few visits up? No Lions had shown up in Abyss lately, he’d recognize them if they did, so where did he know him from…Ah, that was it. Lord Gaspard’s kid, the adopted commoner. Good to solve that mystery, though as for his name…Ashe, that was right. Didn’t he have a couple siblings? Probably named Dust and Grime if they fit the theme…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Idle thoughts aside, Yuri found himself paying more attention to the people than the lesson. Hanneman was the same as ever. The old man was a decent educator, maybe a little long winded, but nice enough. Towards the front though, there was the most interesting man in the room: his highness, the Prince of Faerghus, good old Dimitri. And sure enough, he was right alongside his big buddy, Dedue of Duscur. And wow, that was a massive man. Seemed even bigger than the last time he saw him. Built like an ox seemed like a solid descriptor, though he might be considered more of a castle wall instead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One part of Yuri couldn’t help but draw some comparisons. Balthus could probably take the big man in a fight, but it would be an interesting one to watch. Probably a sight a lot of people would pay for too…hm, he should see how good of a grappler Dedue was first. He was a man built for physical fighting, but that could lend itself to heavy armor and axes over fisticuffs and that wouldn’t be nearly as fun as a pair of bulky brawlers in traditional war master garb going at it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though he did hear the good prince had quite some strength himself, which didn’t quite lend itself to the parallel of “lean princely man and his buff right hand man” that Yuri sort of saw going on. A shame, he could have pretended to be Dimitri’s evil doppelganger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for the other front row folks, the short redheaded girl who couldn’t seem to stop bouncing her knee even as she took notes was probably the Dominic girl. Not the heir, but the baron’s niece, which did make Yuri idly wonder what Simon was up to these days…but he could figure that out later. For now, his eyes drifted over to Lady Dominic’s tall, blonde, and pillowy pal, who was taking notes just as attentively. She seemed like the type who’d be very at home in a monastery like this; one of those caring, pious girls that went into the clergy to happily live their lives for the goddess…at least on first impression. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Speaking of first impressions, Yuri distinctly remembered his first impression of Mister Sylvain Jose Gautier, who was sitting right beside Ingrid Galatea, as one might expect. The Faerghus Four were well known for a reason, though it was interesting to see little Felix was sitting all by his lonesome. Perhaps he was in his moody phase?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, whatever. He had time to figure out what the Lions’ quirks were, especially since none of them had noticed him aside from Ashe. It should make introductions fun later down the line. He was certainly curious if Sylvain would mistake him for a girl again.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Uh, so, why were you in class with us?” Ashe asked once class ended, glancing up at–Then he noticed Yuri had already left and he had to hurry to catch up with him, “A-Ah, hey!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I just thought it would be interesting,” Yuri answered, glancing back at him with a faint smirk, “I used to be a Lion before I became a Wolf, so I wanted to see what it might be like to wear the mane again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh… so, did you like it?" Ashe asked, unsure of what he was saying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It wasn't bad. Hanneman is the same as ever, and the class this time around seems livelier than my old class. Course, I wasn't particularly close to any of those students." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see…um, hey, can I ask why you were in the abyss? You just went missing a few years back, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why would anyone go into hiding, my dear boy? I'm sure you can come up with your own story. Perhaps I did something like you did in the past." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah–wait, how do you know about that?" Ashe asked, a bit taken aback. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You don't become someone in my position without knowing things," Yuri responded, which wasn't exactly a lie. He had heard plenty of dirt about plenty of people, but he mainly heard about Ashe from Rowe complaining that Lord Lonato took in some thief kid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well hey there Yuri, any reason you decided to come visit?" Claude asked, the Golden Deer leader noticing the two chatting in the courtyard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do I need any reason to visit the lovely monastery?" Yuri asked in turn with a wink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t say you </span>
  <em>
    <span>need </span>
  </em>
  <span>a reason, but I imagine you have one. C’mon, you can tell me! Are you visiting friends? Seeing the sights? Or maybe looking for someone in particular?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yuri just grinned. “It’s cute that you’re trying to get info outta me. Cute, but not really effective. You have to at least try to bribe me before I start sharing~.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, and here I thought helping you out in Abyss was enough of a bribe already." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, that’s true. Guess I should go talk with Shez then since she saved the day back then." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What was that about me?" Shez asked, catching wind of what Yuri said as she passed by. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh you know, I was just feeling like I should go talk with my helpful friend who saved the day back in Abyss. Who knows, I still do owe you, how about I take you on a date?" he inquired with a flirtatious wink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You know, no offense Yuri, but you seem like the kind of dude who'd leave me with the tab after sneaking out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ouch, not one to mince words, huh?" Not entirely inaccurate, though he usually saved that for nobles he was trying to scam. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's part of my charm. Either way, no thanks."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can't hurt to ask," Yuri said with a smirk, "But I know a losing battle when I see one." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well in that case, why don't you just hang out with us for now?" Claude offered, "I'm sure there's plenty we can talk about." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My apologies, but I already have my own escort," Yuri replied, gesturing to Ashe. "Unless this young knight would prefer to leave me on my own." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh, well, I'm not doing anything, so I can show you around." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excellent. In that case." Yuri grinned at the deer. "I hope you two have a good day." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, he walked past them, well aware of Claude’s analytical stare as he did. Claude was certainly a mystery he was interested in as well, but in a give and take relationship, he definitely seemed like the type to take more than give. Not that Yuri was any different, but he at least knew well enough when to cut his losses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez on the other hand…Well, he wouldn't call her naive, but she was refreshingly blunt. It was probably more accurate to say that first impressions tended to stick with her. Which, of course, meant she'd end up trusting anyone who made a good first impression unless something big happened to change her mind. Well, Yuri at least hoped he wouldn't end up on her bad side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So…where exactly do you want to go?" Ashe asked as he followed behind Yuri, which wasn’t quite how a “guide” should work. "I mean, do you even need someone to show you around?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's your way of saying you don't want to hang out with me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"N-No!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, well, just felt like having some company," Yuri admitted. "And you just so happened to be the lucky one who gets to show me around." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-Ah, alright…um, well…I guess we can try…maybe the library first?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, I think I want to get something to eat,” he decided before heading towards the dining hall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...why did you ask me to guide you then…?”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Gotta say, the food up here beats that of Abyss any day of the week," Yuri noted after he finished off his food. "Though it is missing that home meal touch." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, yeah I get what you mean. It's not the same without my little siblings around," Ashe mentioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And how are they doing? Everything well on the homefront?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, they’re adjusting…after Lonato…well, um, apparently Sir Gwendal was put in charge of their welfare for the time being so they can at least stay at Lonato’s manor, and there are people from the church making sure they’re cared for.” Ashe sighed. “It’s…going to be difficult though. I can’t imagine trying to take responsibility for the territory will go over well since I used to be a commoner. Not to mention how I tried to stop Lonato during his rebellion. I wouldn’t be surprised if some people blame me for his death…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True, you might have some troubles in the future, but isn’t living in Faerghus all about trying to overcome adversity?” Yuri grinned. “I seem to recall that being a virtue nearly everyone extolled in the knightly circles. ‘Strength in the face of adversity, weather the cold, endure the famine, fight through the plague’, that sort of stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, did you try to become a knight?” Ashe asked, obvious curiosity leaking into his voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, but I spent plenty of time around knights. You pick a few things up here and there,” he replied, before taking note of a certain blue-haired professor walking in with an interesting pair of students. He recognized Ingrid readily enough, given he’d already spotted her earlier, but the short, skittish, purple-haired girl…Well, he knew Bernadetta was the right age to be here, so he shouldn’t be too surprised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey professor!” Yuri decided to call out, raising a hand to catch her attention, “If you’re looking for somewhere to sit, why don’t you join Ashe and me over here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, okay.” She nodded, before heading over to the menu to order while both Ingrid and Bernadetta gave him skeptical looks. Well, Ingrid gave him a skeptical, studying look, while Bernadetta looked frightened by the sudden change in plans…up until she actually started looking at him. Then she couldn’t help but stare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It seemed he was recognizable. Probably not a good thing, given his last encounter with her, but if he wanted to interact with the professor, he had to take some risk there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Gotta say, this is quite the pair you have with you," Yuri commented, noticing the trio all had plates of vegetable pasta salad, though Ingrid had brought along a plate of fried pheasant too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm here to mediate," Byleth responded, sitting between the two students.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, is everything okay?" Ashe asked, making Ingrid look a bit sheepish. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's… something that may have been my fault," Ingrid admitted, while Bernadetta tried to shrink into her clothes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ingrid apparently broke Bernadetta’s door,” Byleth explained, “She fixed it, but I wanted to make sure everything was okay." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? I didn't think the knights of Faerghus made a habit of breaking down doors," Yuri remarked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It was a one time thing!" Ingrid shouted though she immediately regretted it as Bernadetta squeaked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What exactly happened?" Ashe inquired, trying to distract the easily frightened archer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A-Ah, Ingrid came by b-because the professor was training her, and Ingrid realized she hadn't seen me in the training grounds for some time…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I went to go fetch her and…when she didn't come out of her room, I took it upon myself to take drastic measures," Ingrid elaborated after Bernadetta trailed off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"While it is impressive she was able to kick the door off its hinges, I wanted to make sure everything was okay," Byleth finished. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not sure if I can accept that compliment at the moment," Ingrid said with a frown. "Though while I will apologize for the door, I still think it was for the best that she joined in on the training." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"B-But what if there was someone scary in there!? I m-mean, th-there was that one time I got trapped in there with Felix and Emily after Shez left me…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She did?" Byleth asked, a bit surprised. "I'll make sure to talk to her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A-Ah, n-no, it's okay, professor!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…while I can't speak for Emily,” Ingrid began, deciding not to mention how unpleasant the surly Adrestian tended to be, “Felix isn't… as bad as he might seem." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You sure? He seemed to be quite moody from what I saw," Yuri noted, "Unless he's just not a fan of Hanneman's lessons." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, they admittedly aren't usually what Felix wants to focus on," Ingrid commented, "Though, how do you know about Professor Hanneman's lessons?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Yuri used to be part of the Blue Lions a few years ago, apparently,” Ashe answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He was? Huh… well, I did see him working for Count Rowe in the past, so that makes sense." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, if you count being adopted by him as working, then sure," Yuri responded. "And if I remember correctly, you came by to talk with Gwendal about something. Mind If I ask what it was about?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah… I was… cleaning up a friend's mistake." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sylvain?" Byleth asked, to which Ingrid nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, he angered Lord Gwendal by flirting with his daughter."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aaah. Well, for what it's worth, I didn't mind his flirting that much," Yuri responded, getting a skeptical look from Ingrid. "For the record, Gwendal doesn't have a daughter. Though I do consider him like a father." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh! Oh, um…well, you do look really pretty,” she noted, staring at Yuri’s face with a thoughtful expression, which earned a smirk from him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nice to know my looks are appreciated~ Really, he’s not the first to make that sort of assumption and I doubt he’ll be the last so long as I keep these dashing good looks of mine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…right, so, I did want to say I’m sorry, Bernadetta,” Ingrid apologized, focusing back on the shorter girl, “I was too hasty–Well, maybe hasty isn’t the right word…I acted without thinking, and I’m sorry I destroyed your door and scared you like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bernadetta, however, wasn’t paying attention to her. In fact, she was staring at Yuri with a thoughtful expression, which, well, he had a feeling she might piece things together, though he did kind of want to put off that conversation for later. Perhaps in a less public setting? But, well, if she was looking…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello there, Bernie~ Are you so completely entranced by my beauty that you’re at a loss for words~?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-H-Huh!? A-Ah, n-n-no–I-I-I m-mean, u-uh, y-yes–N-No, wait wait wait! I-I-I–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yuri!” Ah, and that earned a frown from Ingrid. “Don’t tease Bernadetta like that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, alright, I’ll focus my attention on you then if you insist~” Ooo, he actually got her to turn a little pink there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She grimaced a second later though. “Please, I grew up with Sylvain, you’re going to have to step up your game if you want to make me blush.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, well if you want to make it a challenge for me, then sure, I’m up for it~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yuri.” And that was an interestingly chiding tone from Byleth there. “Stop teasing my students.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? I didn’t think Ingrid transferred.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop teasing students in general.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, that’s no fun. Well can I tease you instead?” he asked with a grin, “You are rather easy on the eyes after all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you," Byleth said, nonplussed as she ate her salad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, no reaction?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not interested in romance." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Turned down twice in one day, starting to think I'm losing my edge." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure you'll recover." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Letting out an amused huff, Yuri got up, deciding to cut his losses and leave. A moment afterwards, Ashe followed behind him, making him grin as he glanced at the Lion. "You're quite the earnest man, aren't you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, you said you needed an escort, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's true. I'm just surprised you've stuck around my side this entire time," Yuri said, before tussling his hair. "You're going to be quite the heartbreaker in the future, aren't you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-What you're talking about?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well hey there Ashe, who's your friend here?" Sylvain asked, a grin on his face as he looked at Yuri. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh, hey Sylvain. This is Yuri." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yuri huh? You know, I remember reading that Yuri can be another name for a lily, and gotta say, you're definitely as pretty as a flower," he said with a wink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, better than your last attempt to flirt with me," Yuri noted with a smirk. "What was it you said all those years ago? 'Hello there Chickadee, how about you let this rooster into the henhouse?' I believe it was." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yuri had to admit, as fun as it was seeing Sylvain’s eyes widen in shock as he remembered meeting Yuri before, Ashe's grimace was far more hilarious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, well, uh…right." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that offer still on the table or…?" He couldn't help the smirk that crossed his face as Sylvain immediately turned around to leave as his face turned red. "Oh I am going to have so much fun joining the Lions again."</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Ethereal Moon, a month of respite for the students of Garreg Mach Monastery. For many, this particular moon was what they were looking forward to all year, as it was the time of the monastery’s grand ball. A special occasion where they may all eat, drink, and dance the night away. There was even the chance for romance to bloom. </p><p> </p><p>However, not all was well for the students. For one class in particular it was a time of great strife and pain, in which a sacrifice must be made. One of their number would be thrown to the wolves, never to recover again should they fail. Yes, for the Blue Lions it was the worst time of the year. </p><p> </p><p>The White Heron cup was upon them. </p><p> </p><p>Dimitri took a deep, troubled breath as he looked out over his friends and classmates. “Friends, I come to you with an important question. One that will decide the fate of the Blue Lions House going forward: Who should be our representative for the White Heron Cup?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why don’t you do it?” Sylvain suggested, earning an immediate frown from Dimitri.</p><p> </p><p>“Sylvain, you’re my friend, so I’ll let that slide.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Not sure how that could be taken as an insult, but, uh, thanks?”</p><p> </p><p>"I haven't danced since I was a child, Sylvain, if I were to try now I'll just make a mockery of myself," Dimitri explained while Mercedes did her best not to laugh as she remembered the image Byleth had brought up. </p><p> </p><p>"Oooh, in that case, I wanna volunteer!" Annette offered,  immediately jumping up, causing relief to fall over most of the Blue Lions as she did. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I didn't know you could dance, Annie," Mercedes remarked. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I mean, I haven't really been taught or anything, but I'm sure if I give it my all I'll do fine!" </p><p> </p><p>"You did have nice footwork when you were singing," Felix noted, almost making Annette fall over. </p><p> </p><p>"Felix, you weren't supposed to say anything about that!" </p><p> </p><p>"I do remember saying I didn't agree to your deal." </p><p> </p><p>"Well well, didn't expect Felix to go after little Annette~" Sylvain teased. "I mean, getting to hear her sing and dance, it sounds like you two are quite close." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm doing no such thing. All I did was overhear her in the greenhouse," Felix said with a frown. "Besides, I'm pretty sure Claude also heard her once before, given that song I heard him singing to himself-" </p><p> </p><p>"AAAAAH THAT’S IT, I'M NOT VOLUNTEERING!" Annette yelled, her face scarlet as she ran away. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I hope you'll excuse me, I'm going to go make sure she's okay," Mercedes said, getting up to follow Annette.</p><p> </p><p>Sylvain sighed. "Well, there goes that plan. Good going, Felix." </p><p> </p><p>"How is it my fault? I was saying she was a good fit for the position!" </p><p> </p><p>"Either way, we're down a volunteer." </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe we should just have Professor Hanneman choose?" Ashe suggested. "If none of us want to volunteer, we might as well leave it up to chance." </p><p> </p><p>"Honestly, do none of you know how to dance?" Yuri asked, a bit astounded. "I know Faerghus likes to focus on knighthood above all else, but I would think at least some of you were taught how to dance." </p><p> </p><p>"Kinda hard to learn how to dance when you're trying to swim in a full set of armor," Sylvain noted. </p><p> </p><p>"Or fighting a pack of wolves with just a sword," Ingrid said.</p><p> </p><p>"Or just trying to make sure your house doesn't get encased in snow…" Ashe muttered. </p><p> </p><p>Not for the first time since joining the Blue Lions, Dedue felt very worried for his classmates.</p><p> </p><p>"Hm, well, as an olive branch to my new classmates, I suppose I might as well volunteer to do away with this negativity,” Yuri offered, “I may never have been officially taught, but I did spend enough time around nobles back in the empire to pick up a thing or two." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, that's great Yuri-" </p><p> </p><p>"That being said, I expect to be paid back for this. Unless any of you want to volunteer." He was met with silence. "Excellent, in that case, I might as well practice a bit." And might be a good idea to scope the competition. He was confident enough in his skills, but it would only be proper to know who he was going up against.</p><hr /><p>"Okay so that's…two votes for Ferdinand, three for Flayn, and seven for Dorothea," Byleth stated as she noted down the final tally.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, it is a shame I wasn't chosen, but I will cheer you on nonetheless Dorothea!" Flayn said, smiling at her classmate. </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, thanks Flayn~! If it helps, I did vote for you," Dorothea replied, smiling at her shorter classmate. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, as much as I wished to show off my own moves, I couldn't help but vote for you as well Flayn. The eagerness you showed set my own noble heart ablaze!" Ferdinand declared, smiling brightly.</p><p> </p><p>"Perhaps it was for the best you didn't win, Ferdinand. Though I may have voted for you, I do seem to recall you making quite the fool of yourself back when I attended a ball your family was hosting," Constance remarked, laughing into her fan. </p><p> </p><p>"I remember no such thing! Perhaps you were just so dazzled by my moves that you misremembered it? Isn't that right, Lady Edelgard?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Perhaps it is for the best that you choose to fight as cavalry, Ferdinand," Edelgard noted, getting her class to laugh as she also remembered his…dazzling moves. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, guess that settles that. Was kinda obvious Dorothea would win," Hapi muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"It really was. Logically speaking, the one most skilled at dancing should be the one to do so," Linhardt added, bored with the proceedings already.</p><p> </p><p>"I-I'm just glad I don't have to be the one to do it, I'm already dreading the ball…" Bernadetta commented, not looking forward to having to dance in front of so many people.</p><p> </p><p>"...we don't need to dance, right?" Marianne asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Come on you two, it'll be great!" Caspar said, grinning at his classmates. "Tons of food and fun!" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…will they be allowing traditional Brigid dances?" Petra asked.</p><p> </p><p>"There is no rule stating what dances are allowed," Hubert noted. </p><p> </p><p>"I'll check to make sure it's all okay," Byleth said, nodding. "I should probably also read up on dances to help Dorothea practice." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, thank you Professor. Do you have any experience?" </p><p> </p><p>"None at all, but I have read up on dancers. Apparently if you win, the church will reward us with materials to let you be one on the battlefield." </p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, how preposterous. So should we expect her to perform a ballroom dance as we fight?" Hubert snidely asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Not exactly. Traditionally dancers on the battlefield help raise morale by inspiring troops, and supposedly the winner of the contest will also be awarded with garb that has been enchanted to increase their speed," Byleth responded, "So even though I don't know how to dance, I'll do my best to help." </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, in that case, I'll do my best!" Dorothea declared, a grin on her face. "Though if you want to help me practice, then it's best to get some in-person practice instead of reading some books." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah… are you sure? I've never really danced before." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course! In fact, why don't we all practice together? I mean, even if I'm the one competing, the ball is still happening at the end of the month~" Dorothea said, grinning. </p><p> </p><p>"...Hm, that is true, and our mission this month is only dealing with some bandits, so we don't have anything big to deal with," Byleth considered, thinking for a moment, before nodding. "Okay, today's class shall be dance practice." </p><p> </p><p>"W-What!?" Bernadetta squeaked.</p><p> </p><p>"Great, in that case, come on then! The courtyard would be better for this!" Dorothea said, leading some of her more eager classmates out, while those not looking forward to the dance trudged behind. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I must admit, I never thought I would have 'dance practice' as one of my lessons at the academy," Edelgard said to Byleth, "Not to be rude, but would I be able to skip this? I actually am a skilled dancer as it is." </p><p> </p><p>"You are? I'm surprised you didn't volunteer." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I quite enjoyed dancing when I was younger. Though, as you can plainly see, I wasn't the most eager to do so," Edelgard pointed out, looking out at the courtyard as she saw Dorothea instruct some of their classmates, "And I have no interest in being a dancer on the field as it were. It would be quite difficult dancing in a full set of armor." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth couldn't help but imagine that, making her giggle for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>"I suppose that would be inspiring in its own way," Byleth said, missing the slight smile on Edelgard’s face from hearing her professor giggle. "Oh, if you are a skilled dancer, would you be able to dance with Dorothea so I can have an example?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Professor, if I may ask, are you… attempting to accomplish something between Dorothea and I?" </p><p> </p><p>"I think you two would be cute together." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard felt her face warm at the admission, though she wasn’t sure how to feel about it. Her professor was the person she had feelings for, so being told she was trying to nudge her towards another woman was…confusing. Though, she did feel her eyes turn towards Dorothea, noting the kind smile on her face as she led Petra through a few steps of a waltz. </p><p> </p><p>“...H-Hm.” How in the world was she supposed to respond to a statement like that?</p><p> </p><p>Byleth, meanwhile, felt her smile grow as she saw Edelgard staring at Dorothea with a very obvious blush. She was definitely the best matchmaker! </p><hr /><p>"So… how exactly do we break this news?" Claude asked Hilda and Lorenz. </p><p> </p><p>"How does someone even do that with this type of news?" Lorenz asked in turn, frowning as he looked at his class, squabbling amongst themselves about who'd be made to be the representative. </p><p> </p><p>"I mean… it would probably be best just to tell her right?" Hilda suggested, really not happy, that she had to be involved as Claude’s retainer. "She's not gonna be happy if we keep this a secret and she finds out from someone else." </p><p> </p><p>"...Very well. My father is the one attempting to handle matters, so it's only right I do so as well." Lorenz decided, frowning as he prepared himself. </p><p> </p><p>"Right, thanks Lorenz. I'll make sure to keep the class occupied while you do," Claude offered, trying to put a smile on his face as he approached his classmates. "Hey there everyone, any luck on choosing the sacrifice?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah, it's gonna be Emily," Shez said, getting said student to slam her hands on the desk. </p><p> </p><p>"I never said yes!" </p><p> </p><p>"I can do it if she doesn't want to,” Raphael offered, “I'll make sure everyone has a fun time laughing!" </p><p> </p><p>"Raphael, you're not supposed to make people laugh at the white Heron cup…" Ignatz pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>"As much as I don't like to admit it, a noble would probably be a better option for this," Leonie noted with a frown. "Pretty sure any dances I know aren't going to be a hit." </p><p> </p><p>"I have no interest in dancing either. I've been neglecting my studies, so I'll be focusing on that." Lysithea said, thinking about how she was already making preparations for going to the Empire. Though that was cut off as Lorenz tapped her shoulder, gesturing for her to follow him. </p><p> </p><p>"I mean, I'd be willing to do it if someone paid me," Balthus muttered as the mage and cavalier left the classroom. Lysithea could hear Hilda begin to try and nudge Emily into agreeing as they left, so odds were the Adrestian noble really would be their ‘sacrifice’.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you want?" she asked her taller classmate after they walked a bit further, not wanting to be overheard by the Black Eagles practicing in the courtyard. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah… Lysithea, have you heard about what has happened in the Alliance?" Lorenz asked, trying to broach the topic carefully. </p><p> </p><p>"Nothing as of late. Why, what happened?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well…after the Almyran attack, several nobles began to...take political action, attempting to expand their own powers and such. As it turns out, Archeron is one of those nobles." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? And what did that blowhard do?" </p><p> </p><p>"He has made an attempt to try and raise his house into great house status. To that end, he has taken over Ordelia territory." </p><p> </p><p>Lysithea went still, her eyes going wide. "...What?" </p><p> </p><p>"He is using the Almyran attack as an excuse to say that despite its status as a great house, Ordelia made no attempt to help." </p><p> </p><p>"Th-That's because it doesn't have the power to do so!" </p><p> </p><p>"Exactly. That lack of power is the leg he is using to stand on to try and force this. And since no other great house attempted to help during the attack either, all of them are keeping quiet." </p><p> </p><p>"That–They can't just do nothing!" </p><p> </p><p>"It's difficult. I understand what you're thinking, but Archeron has made his demands, and has said if they aren't met, he will attempt to secede to the Empire, saying he is already in contact with Duke Aegir," Lorenz explained, frowning, "My father has taken your family under his protection, so they are safe, but as he is part of the pro-Imperial households in the Alliance, there is little he can do under such threats without jeopardizing the connections he has." </p><p> </p><p>"..." </p><p> </p><p>"My father will attempt to figure out something, but until then he will ensure your family is–Lysithea?!" Lorenz called out in surprise as the mage abruptly pushed past him, and ran towards Edelgard. </p><p> </p><p>"Edelgard, what the hell!?" she called out the princess, breaking her out of her stare as she tore her eyes from where she had been watching Dorothea and Byleth practicing. </p><p> </p><p>"Lysithea, what is the matter?" </p><p> </p><p>"Isn't it obvious!? Why is Acheron attempting to secede to the Empire with Ordelia territory!?" Lysithea demanded to know, getting the practice to stop as everyone heard what she was saying. </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s eyes visibly widened in surprise, before she moved to fully face the younger girl. “What are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m talking about Acheron! The Weathervane of House Phlegethon! Why is he threatening to secede to the Empire with my parents’ territory!?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Her frown deepened, her eyes glancing towards Lorenz for a moment before she looked at Lysithea again. “Lysithea, I need you to explain to me what happened. I haven’t heard of any of this.”</p><p> </p><p>“How couldn’t you?! Lorenz said–!”</p><p> </p><p>“Lysithea, pardon my interruption, but I believe Edelgard when she says she knows nothing of what happened,” Lorenz cut in, trying to head off Lysithea’s anger before he looked towards the imperial princess, “Though I will note that it is concerning that Acheron is apparently operating with the backing of the Imperial Prime Minister.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Lorenz, Lysithea, please explain to me what you mean,” Edelgard requested, her tone noticeably getting colder after the Prime Minister was mentioned.</p><p> </p><p>“Acheron stole my parents’ land,” Lysithea explained, scowling, “He’s trying to push to join the Round Table and he occupied Ordelia territory to make that happen! Apparently my parents are only safe because Lorenz’s father is sheltering them–Ah, thank you for that, by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, no need to–”</p><p> </p><p>“But now that he’s occupying our land, he’s saying he’ll secede to the Empire if his House doesn’t get to become a great one!” she continued, verbally barreling over Lorenz along the way, “And–And he just–How could he even do that?!”</p><p> </p><p>“...Well, he has shown himself to be very opportunistic–”</p><p> </p><p>“I KNOW THAT PART, LORENZ! I don’t understand <em> how </em> he did it! Didn’t we fight his forces off easily just a few months ago?! How could he possibly muster enough military power to take over Ordelia territory to begin with!? Is the Empire really helping him that much!?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think so, but I plan to investigate,” Edelgard stated with a deep frown on her face, “Let me assure you, Lysithea, I had no idea Lord Acheron was making a move like this." </p><p> </p><p>"At the very least I've heard no word of my father being in contact with Archeron," Ferdinand said with a frown as he came over, "I can assure you if he is behind this, he shall properly pay his dues!" </p><p> </p><p>"Professor, my apologies, but I shall need to step away for the moment," Edelgard stated, getting Byleth to nod as she frowned. </p><p> </p><p>"So, I don't really know what's going on, but a bad guy took over Lysithea's place right?” Caspar spoke up, “Then let's go beat him up!" </p><p> </p><p>"It's not that simple, Caspar. It'd be one thing if he was just making an attempt to seize Ordelia’s land, but the fact that he was already able to take over the territory without anyone noticing, all while aided by unknown forces means we cannot act rashly," Lorenz responded, not noticing how Byleth perked up at the words ‘unknown forces’. </p><p> </p><p>“...Lysithea, can I speak with you for a moment?” the professor requested, prompting a curious look from Lorenz and a slight frown from Ferdinand.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor…does the name ‘Myson’ mean anything to you?” the ginger noble decided to ask, earning an alarmed look from Edelgard that she barely managed to hide while Byleth frowned, thinking she might know where he was going with this. Lorenz and Lysithea, meanwhile, were just confused.</p><p> </p><p>“No, it doesn’t. It might relate to who I am thinking about though. May I ask who ‘Myson’ is?”</p><p> </p><p>“A warlock that my father associates with.” Even Ferdinand couldn’t miss the gasp Lysithea let out there.. “One I harbor certain…suspicions towards.”</p><p> </p><p>“F-Ferdinand, does this Myson person belong to a group–” </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard cleared her throat, catching everyone’s attention. “I believe this matter may require more…subtlety to discuss.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, not to worry, Edelgard. I am the very picture of subtlety!” Lorenz assured. No one, aside from Ferdinand, looked reassured.</p><p> </p><p>“...Be that as it may, Lorenz, we’re still in the courtyard,” she pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that is true. Well, I’m sure we can find a more private location to discuss this matter then!" </p><p> </p><p>"...I'm sorry Lorenz, but this is a private matter between Edelgard and Lysithea," Byleth said, getting Lorenz to frown before he shook his head.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm afraid that I can't sit this one out, professor. As it is, I do feel some guilt for allowing this situation to occur in the first place. It was my decision to spare Archeron when I dealt with him a few months ago and if I had taken action then." </p><p> </p><p>"I understand, and I appreciate your stance. However, I think it would be better if we talk privately first. We can tell you the details when it’s possible, but for now, can you write back to your father to ask for more information on what happened in Ordelia territory?”</p><p> </p><p>"..." Letting out a sigh, Lorenz frowned. "Very well, that does sound like it could help, but I request you tell me as soon as you can!" </p><p> </p><p>At his request, Edelgard nodded. "Now then, I believe we should head back into the classroom to discuss this." </p><p> </p><p>That didn’t sit well with her retainer. "Lady Edelgard, I don't-" </p><p> </p><p>"Hubert, please make sure no one enters the room while we discuss things," Edelgard said, her tone making it clear it was an order, not a request. </p><p> </p><p>"...Very well, Lady Edelgard," Hubert agreed, glowering as he did. Soon enough, the four of them were in the Black Eagle classroom, the doors closed to give them privacy. </p><p> </p><p>"Ferdinand, who is Myson?" Lysithea demanded to know. For a moment, Ferdinand glanced at Edelgard who nodded in return. </p><p> </p><p>"Both she and the professor are aware of what happened to me."</p><p> </p><p>"...As I said, he is a warlock my father keeps company with. While I have no definitive proof of what he did, he, along with my father, committed a horrible atrocity," Ferdinand explained, "I haven't seen him in years, but if Archeron is being truthful about working with my father, I wouldn't be surprised if Myson has been a middleman of sorts." </p><p> </p><p>"It also means that the people Myson is working with might also be taking a more proactive role," Byleth noted. </p><p> </p><p>"For that matter, who exactly are these people?" Ferdinand asked. </p><p> </p><p>"They're apparently from a place called Agartha. They also seem to be performing several experiments in an attempt to create a human weapon," Lysithea explained, and as she did, Ferdinand glanced between her and Edelgard, a look of understanding crossing his face. </p><p> </p><p>"I see…" </p><p> </p><p>"One thing is certain, if we are to act, we must do something about Duke Aegir first. With Ordelia under his control, trying to do something to Archeron can put those still living under that territory in danger, particularly if he has Aegir’s backing," Edelgard said, before looking at Lysithea, "Will that be okay, Lysithea?" </p><p> </p><p>"...My parents are okay. As far as I am aware, my father and Count Gloucester are old friends, so I'm sure he's treating them well. Do not expect me to wait forever though." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, we shall move as soon as possible." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, if my father truly is involved, then there will be evidence this time, I'm sure of it!" Ferdinand said, getting Edelgard to frown. </p><p> </p><p>"And what if there isn't?" she asked, catching him off guard. </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me?" </p><p> </p><p>"What if there is no evidence? Are we going to sit idly by and do nothing?" </p><p> </p><p>"That is not what I mean, Lady Edelgard. However, if he is to stand trial, we must first obtain evidence of his wrongdoings." </p><p> </p><p>"Would that even help?" Byleth asked. "If he’s corrupt, then how many other people are corrupt? For all we know, the person meant to sentence him could be in his pocket." </p><p> </p><p>"That–I understand my father may be a criminal, but we cannot assume every noble is one as well." </p><p> </p><p>"Even if they aren't, most of them are self-serving," Lysithea muttered, "My family suffered because of the Empire before and no other house did anything, and even now they aren't acting." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure they're just biding their time as well-" Ferdinand started, before Edelgard slammed her hand on a desk. </p><p> </p><p>"Ferdinand, you should know as well as I do by now how corrupt the nobility can be. Six of the major houses in the empire turned against the emperor, and sat idly by as my family was experimented on. If you truly believe it is the duty of a noble to look after everyone else, then you should see how this system has laid the foundation for corruption!" Edelgard stated, frowning at Ferdinand. "Our ancestors might have 'earned' the right to be nobles, but how did the nobility of those who came after earned it? I am willing to admit there are those who may be deserving of being called noble, but a vast majority have the title simply because of their blood, and they make no attempt to prove themselves worthy!" </p><p> </p><p>“...I…cannot deny your words. But I still believe in nobility! Yes, it may be…less common than it should be for nobles to live up to the ideal they should hold, but that does not devalue those ideals!”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have anything against those ideals, Ferdinand. What I take exception with is the people who use those ideals as an excuse to be corrupt! People who claim to be guiding and protecting the commonfolk under their power while actually abusing them benefit from the concept of the ideal nobility! As long as we place value in the system of nobility, it can be used as an excuse to do harm!”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not–...” Ferdinand took a breath. “I know there are problems, Edelgard. I…What do you propose we do then? If you’re so convinced we cannot have my father removed through legal means, what do you plan to do? Because I will not condone assassination.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nor should you. And I do not intend to use illegal means to remove your father, merely nonstandard ones.” Edelgard straightened, facing Ferdinand directly. “Ferdinand von Aegir, would you support me if I chose to take the throne of Adrestia before the school year ends?”</p><p> </p><p>"I… I already made it clear that I will support you when you become Emperor. Though, I would like to point out that you would have many duties that you would need to perform should you choose to become Emperor, many of which would require your attention far more than what the academy would let you." </p><p> </p><p>"I understand that. If need be, I am willing to withdraw from the academy," Edelgard stated, catching everyone off guard. </p><p> </p><p>"You are?" Ferdinand asked.</p><p> </p><p>"...I suppose that's as good a sign as any how seriously you're taking this," Lysithea remarked, still frowning. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth, meanwhile, stayed silent, not sure what to say. Especially since she felt… tense. She had already known Edelgard was going to be Emperor, but for her to leave before the school year was over… </p><p> </p><p>"...very well. I must admit, it would be foolish of me to stand against you if you're being genuine. I, Ferdinand Von Aegir, swear to support your ascension to the throne." </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you." At that, Edelgard glanced at Byleth. "Professor, there are things I would need to prepare first, but would you be willing to accompany me when I head to the empire later this month?" </p><p> </p><p>"You want me to go with you?" </p><p> </p><p>"For one to ascend to the throne, one needs a representative from the church. I can think of no other I would prefer than you to be the representative," Edelgard stated. </p><p> </p><p>"...okay, I promise." </p><p> </p><p>"If I may, what exactly are you planning on doing once you ascend the throne?" Lysithea asked. At that, Edelgard took a deep breath. This was a big risk, but if she could convince Ferdinand, then she could surely convince everyone else. </p><p> </p><p>"I plan on abolishing the nobility system." </p><p> </p><p>"E-Edelgard–!?" Ferdinand started before she raised a hand to cut him off. </p><p> </p><p>"To be specific, my plan is to establish a system of merits, one where those who have the ability to, shall rise and be rewarded. Even if there are nobles who truly wish to protect those under them, they aren't allowing them to flourish. Think about Dorothea, because of the circumstances she had, she was able to join the academy despite being a commoner, but how many other commoners could be as skilled as her, if not more, if they were only given a chance to rise above their station? If we had more people like you, then this system would not be needed, but as is, if you truly wish to help the commonfolk, then you must see how damaging the nobility system is to them. If you truly wish to guide them as a noble, then do so, help them rise above their station so that those who can are able to earn the position they deserve!" </p><p> </p><p>"I… I understand what you are saying, but I have a hard time accepting it. I truly believe that the nobility should work to protect everyone," Ferdinand said, before sighing. "...How certain are you of your system working?" </p><p> </p><p>"It will take a great deal of work, and I don't expect it to be accomplished overnight, but I am completely certain that a new system is needed to fix what is wrong with Adrestia." </p><p> </p><p>"...I want you to write your manifesto. Let me read all your reforms. If I truly believe in what you are saying, I shall fully support you, but, if I find any faults, then I expect you to be willing to listen to my criticism." </p><p> </p><p>"I will be more than willing," Edelgard stated, meeting his eyes without flinching. </p><p> </p><p>After a moment, he nodded. "Very well. Then, as said, I, Ferdinand Von Aegir, shall support your ascension to the throne." </p><p> </p><p>At that, Edelgard couldn't help but feel a swell of joy. It worked, she had been able to convince him! </p><p> </p><p>"...Thank you Ferdinand," Edelgard said, hiding the elation she felt before she turned to Lysithea. "My apologies for getting off topic, Lysithea."</p><p> </p><p>"It seemed necessary," Lysithea replied, turning away. "...For what it's worth, I had no intention of continuing House Ordelia. I am not opposed to your idea of doing away with the nobility." </p><p> </p><p>"Somehow, it feels like my statements lose some of their standing when another noble is okay with doing away with the nobility…" Ferdinand muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"Come now Ferdinand. If you end up crumbling so easily, I'm not sure how well any criticisms you have may stand," Edelgard teasingly chided. "Now, before we end this, I must ask that you keep what I told you a secret. I am planning on informing more people of my plans, but if word were to spread, then who knows what the nobility of Adrestria may do?" Or what the Church might do, but she wouldn’t say that.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, I'm not one to spread gossip," Lysithea said. </p><p> </p><p>"I swear to keep this discussion a secret, though I do ask you to hurry with your manifesto," Ferdinand requested. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course. Oh, and Ferdinand, could you distract Hubert for a bit as you leave so I may discuss something with the professor?" </p><p> </p><p>"I shall do my best,” Ferdinand stated, before he and Lysithea left. The pair that remained behind heard Ferdinand say something about needing Hubert's help to practice dancing, before the doors closed again.</p><p> </p><p>"...I must admit, being able to openly discuss my plans certainly removes a weight from my shoulders," Edelgard said with a smile. Byleth responded with a noncommittal noise, thinking that if things really had gone wrong with Ferdinand, she might have turned back time just to stop it. "I suppose I have you to thank in part for that, my teacher. If you hadn't made me tell Lysithea and Shez my reasoning I might have ended up keeping more secrets." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I'm glad I could help," Byleth said, before frowning. "...are you actually going to leave the academy?" </p><p> </p><p>"...if need be, yes. I must say, this isn't quite exactly how I planned on becoming emperor, but such is how things go." </p><p> </p><p>"When are you leaving?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I would prefer to be here for the White Heron cup, to cheer Dorothea on,” she explained, which did make Byleth perk up a little, “Afterwards, I'll likely head back to take the throne, though I am not certain when exactly I will be withdrawing from the academy." </p><p> </p><p>"You should make sure to stay for the ball. Everyone is looking forward to it and it won't be the same with you gone." </p><p> </p><p>"If I can, I'll make sure to be here," Edelgard agreed, "At the very least, I would prefer we properly deal with Emily before I actually leave." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…" Byleth couldn't help but frown. She knew they had to address the Emily issue. She was well aware, but…</p><p> </p><p>"Being the emperor will help with that,” Edelgard continued, unaware of Byleth’s inner turmoil, “It will be easy to investigate the Korsch family to see if Emily has been replaced. I have to admit, I am already convinced she is one of the imposters, but it would be best if we could be sure.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right…” That hadn’t been what Edelgard said before. She could change her mind, of course, that was fine. Right? “When do you think she was replaced?”</p><p> </p><p>“If I were to guess, I imagine it had to be before the school year began.”</p><p> </p><p>“So the Emily we’ve known was never the real Emily.” Byleth frowned, leaning back against one of the desks. “Which means the ‘Emily’ we know is an entirely different person from whoever Emily Korsch was. It also means the original is likely dead. It would be foolish to leave her alive if they had no further use for her.” She knew she was echoing Sothis’s words. Part of her felt like a hypocrite.</p><p> </p><p>“That is very likely, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“...It’s strange. I shouldn’t feel conflicted, but I do. Emily can be unpleasant, but…she is one of my students. Or, she was.”</p><p> </p><p>“Professor…you can’t feel that way about a spy.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know. I just…I hope she really isn’t an enemy. I don’t want to hurt one of my students.”</p><p> </p><p>“...That’s a very kind attitude for a mercenary, professor,” Edelgard noted, trying to sound a little teasing.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m a teacher now, not a mercenary. My attitude needs to change to suit my profession. I think.” She shrugged. “...Maybe things would have been simpler if my father hadn’t left all those years ago and I became a knight instead…but, then, I wouldn’t have what I have now, so…Everything is very complicated.”</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed. Life tends to be, professor. If it wasn't, I likely would have remained a spoiled princess, maybe only worrying about an arranged marriage or what sweets I would try to sneak at night," Edelgard said wistfully, "Though I suppose in that scenario, we likely would have met in the academy again. Just without the bandits coming after us." </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe? That's… nice to think about, still being able to meet you all," Byleth replied, a small smile on her face. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, though, I am glad to be able to call you my teacher." </p><p> </p><p>"And I'm glad to be able to have you as my student." </p><p> </p><p>"...Professor, before I leave the academy, I have something important I wish to tell you," Edelgard said, keeping herself steady, "When that time comes, I hope you are able to understand." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, whenever you're ready," Byleth replied, before she got up, "Now I'll leave you to your investigating. I should make sure everyone is actually dancing." </p><p> </p><p>"Knowing our classmates, they likely are," Edelgard remarked, chuckling to herself, even as she prepared herself for what she would confess.</p><p> </p><p>Her teacher deserved to know her identity as the Flame Emperor.</p>

  <p>“Lady Edelgard, what the fuck?”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard blinked, then glanced up from her tea in visible confusion at her retainer. “...What did you just say, Hubert?”</p><p> </p><p>“I said, Lady Edelgard, what do you think you’re doing?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” She was fairly certain that wasn’t what he said, but also the first thing she heard sounded so completely out of character for him to say that she genuinely thought an auditory hallucination was more likely. Though his actual question still warranted a prodding response. “I am having tea, Hubert.”</p><p> </p><p>He looked distinctly unamused by her wit.</p><p> </p><p>"Why did you inform Ferdinand of all people of your plans?" Hubert said, glowering. "It is one thing to divulge your secrets to someone, but why him of all people? Just because he agrees his father must be punished doesn't mean he would have agreed with your goals." </p><p> </p><p>"And yet, he did. While he will likely have his criticisms of my reforms, the fact doesn't change that he is supporting me. Really, the fact that I told Ferdinand is for the best." </p><p> </p><p>"And why exactly is that?" </p><p> </p><p>"Simple, if I was able to convince him, think of how much easier it will be to convince everyone else." </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "What?"  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"It's what I'm planning on doing. Before I leave to ascend the throne, I'll make my case to my classmates. We are in need of allies, Hubert. It may be some time, years even, before we are capable of declaring war with the choices we’ve made so far, but changing the nobility system in Adrestia will require all the aid we can get. Especially if Those Who Slither in the Dark are active." </p><p> </p><p>"Lady Edelgard, I must insist you do not follow this plan." </p><p> </p><p>"Hubert, you're my most trusted ally, and my closest friend. I understand where your concern is coming from, but both of our ideas share the same level of risk. At least this way, we can plan around those who may or may not work with us, rather than letting things land as they may." </p><p> </p><p>"...I strongly advise against this course of action." </p><p> </p><p>"I'll make sure to keep that in mind. At the very least do take some comfort in knowing I won't tell Flayn." </p><p> </p><p>"I would hope you weren't foolish enough to inform her," Hubert muttered while Edelgard went back to her tea. Despite the confidence she seemed to hold, she was undoubtedly nervous about actually being honest with her classmates. For now though…. Best plan on who to talk to first.</p><hr /><p>"Dorothea, a word please." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, sure Edie, what do you need?" Dorothea asked, glancing towards the princess while she helped Marianne practice her dancing with Hilda. It was almost funny seeing the Golden Deer so eagerly join in the next day of practicing after hearing what had happened to Ordelia. Apparently they wanted to distract themselves from the bad news, though Lysithea looked like she was about to blast someone in the face. That was probably because Shez was practically carrying her while they 'practiced' though.</p><p> </p><p>"Follow me if you would," Edelgard requested, leading the way to a corner at the far end of the courtyard. Raising an eyebrow, Dorothea followed behind, giving Hilda a thumbs up as she gave one in return. "I trust you heard what is happening in the Alliance?" </p><p> </p><p>"It was hard not to, Lysithea was being quite loud yesterday," Dorothea muttered with a frown. "Is everything okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not yet, but it will be. I'm having Hubert investigate at the moment and I'm already planning what to do to resolve things," Edelgard explained, "Before the end of the month, I am planning on taking the throne of Adrestia." </p><p> </p><p>"Really? Well, that's a surprise to hear… I had already known you'd be the Emperor, but to hear it happening so soon… well, it's a bit hard to imagine our little Edie like that." Dorothea teased, getting Edelgard to blush. </p><p> </p><p>"H-Hm. To that end, I wanted to know if you would support my ascension?" Now that actually caught her off guard.</p><p> </p><p>"Huh? I mean, of course I do. Just, is it necessary to ask me? I mean, I'm not a noble." </p><p> </p><p>"You are still one of my closest friends. Not to mention that an Emperor doesn't just rule over the nobility. I also wished to ask if you truly support me in abolishing the nobility system," Edelgard stated, making her intentions clear. </p><p> </p><p>"...Of course I do, I have no love for the nobility, so if you were to do away with them, I certainly wouldn't complain," Dorothea said, before smiling. "Maybe I really should start writing that play about you? The young emperor seeking to change the empire, perhaps with a dashing mercenary by her side~?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm. I would prefer the play remain as close to fact as it can if you write it. That being said, I will likely be away from the academy after this month." Edelgard did her best to adopt a teasing smile. "Perhaps you'll be able to take the time to grow closer to our professor while I'm gone." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm~ That is true, I can certainly make sure to sing your praises to her while you're gone~" Dorothea shot back, flustering Edelgard as she did. </p><p> </p><p>"...As odd as this sounds, I will miss being able to talk with you everyday like this once I take the throne, Dorothea," Edelgard said, after calming herself down. </p><p> </p><p>"Same for me Edie, but I look forward to meeting the emperor of Adrestia," Dorothea replied, giggling as they turned back to rejoin the class. </p><p> </p><p>Though as they did, they noticed Byleth speaking with Manuela, before the two glanced over at them. They then proceeded to give them both a thumbs up. </p><p> </p><p>"...Perhaps we should try to clear any misunderstandings first," Edelgard suggested. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm~ I dunno, is it a misunderstanding?" Dorothea asked with a teasing smile. "I mean, it is common for the Emperor to take on multiple consorts, no?" </p><p> </p><p>"...H-Huh?" Edelgard asked, her face burning up. But Dorothea didn’t reply, instead simply heading back to practice with that same teasing smile. “...H-Hmph…th-that’s not…”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard shook her head, trying to clear her head of the thoughts Dorothea’s teasing suggestion brought to mind. It was much more difficult than she thought it should be…</p><hr /><p>"Thank you for having tea with me, Petra," Edelgard said, smiling at her friend. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, it is a pleasure to be here," Petra replied, smiling in return. </p><p> </p><p>"Now, while I would love to have small talk, I would rather cut to the chase." </p><p> </p><p>"Are we chasing something?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, what I want to say is that I will likely be leaving the academy soon. I intend to become the emperor within the coming weeks." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah… that is certainly not small at all," Petra noted, "You are following your ambitions, yes?" </p><p> </p><p>"I am, though admittedly I didn't plan to go after them so soon. That being said, I do remember telling you I would hit as many pheasant as I needed to. As such, once you graduate, I plan on letting you return to Brigid and freeing your nation." </p><p> </p><p>"...You would?" Petra asked, a bit of disbelief in her voice. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I want Brigid to be an ally of the Empire, not a vassal. Once you become the queen of Brigid, I hope we will be able to shake hands as you once said," Edelgard stated, "Though, admittedly, it may be some time before that occurs. The reforms I will enact are guaranteed to cause unrest in the Empire, so I doubt we will be able to discuss becoming allies right away." </p><p> </p><p>"So… you would allow the people of Brigid to be free? No knots to the empire in any way?" Petra asked, "The people of my nation may not do nothing. They bear many grudges and may attempt something." </p><p> </p><p>"I wouldn't be surprised if they did. Even so, I want to put my trust in you, as my friend." </p><p> </p><p>"...You are being far more honest, Edelgard." </p><p> </p><p>"I suppose I am. We can thank our professor for that." </p><p> </p><p>"...The professor is a very kind person," Petra admitted, after a moment of silence. "At times, it is difficult to imagine her as a fighter." </p><p> </p><p>"It is, yet that kindness and strength has guided us and made us all the stronger." </p><p> </p><p>"It has," Petra agreed, before nodding, "I swear, once I am the queen of Brigid, I shall make our nations allies." </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you Petra. I am looking forward to it."</p><hr /><p>The clashing of axes could be heard in the training grounds, interspersed with the yelling of a young man as he swung his axe with all his might. Yet, even as he did, his opponent was able to block all his attacks with her own axe. Even without her shield, it was clear she was far more skilled with the heavy weapon than he was. Even so, he wouldn't give up, especially when he still had his secret weapon! </p><p> </p><p>With a loud yell, he swung his axe, a flame bursting over its head as he aimed to disarm his opponent! </p><p> </p><p>A loud clang was his answer, as well as a heat far stronger than he was used to as his opponent met his axe with hers, her weapon also coated in fire. </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, I was saving that up and you just have it too?" Caspar complained, pulling back as he began to pant. </p><p> </p><p>"You do remember we have the same professor, right Caspar? We also both share the same affinity," Edelgard asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>"Right, I uh… kinda did forget about that second part," Caspar admitted, a bit sheepishly. "But you know, that was pretty cool! I can already see it! You, the professor, and I, hunting down bandits in the night, only for our weapons to light up the darkness! It'll look so cool!" </p><p> </p><p>"I see you're the same as ever, Caspar." </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, that's not true! I'm way stronger now!" Caspar argued. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, that is true at least." </p><p> </p><p>"Glad you agree! So what's up? You have something important to talk about, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"That I do. I'm surprised you realized it." </p><p> </p><p>"Is it? I mean, it was pretty obvious something was up, you never really ask me to spar and the way you fought was different." Crossing his arms, Caspar thought for a moment. "It was like…like you were the professor! Yeah, like you were testing me or something!" </p><p> </p><p>"...I must admit, I didn't expect you to pick up on that." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course I would! If there's one thing I know, it's fighting!"</p><p> </p><p>"That you do," Edelgard said with a smile. "Caspar, I will become Emperor at the end of the month. Once I ascend to the throne, I intend to rid Adrestia of its current system of nobility. As the second son of your family, and someone without a crest, you have very low prospects within our current system. I believe you are capable of doing great things, and in my new system, your talents will have the opportunity to flourish. Do I have your support?”</p><p> </p><p>"Do you even need to ask? Of course I’ll back you up, we're friends!" Caspar declared with a smile. "I mean, as long as I get to beat bad guys, I don't think there'll be much change in my life anyways." </p><p> </p><p>"...I must say, you may be remarkably simple at times, but it is surprisingly refreshing." </p><p> </p><p>"Uh…you're welcome? I think?" Caspar said, getting Edelgard to laugh. </p><hr /><p>“...Linhardt, how is it that whenever I track you down, you’re always sleeping?”</p><p> </p><p>“That feels like it’s more your fault than mine,” Linhardt grumbled from beneath the book he’d laid over his face, his back flat against the grass beneath him as he relaxed in the shade of a tree. "Especially since you're waking me up." </p><p> </p><p>"...Can you please get up so I can discuss something with you?" Edelgard requested, not wanting to get into an argument. </p><p> </p><p>"If this is about you being the emperor and doing away with the nobility, sure, go ahead. I have no interest in taking on any noble duties." </p><p> </p><p>"...” She sighed. “Why do you already know what I'm about to ask you?" </p><p> </p><p>"Did you think Caspar would actually refrain from telling me?" he asked, moving the book on his face so he could give Edelgard a skeptical glance. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I suppose that is my fault." </p><p> </p><p>"Quite. Anyways, onto more important stuff, I actually came to an astounding break-through in my research," Linhardt said, sitting up, "I think the professor’s crest might be artificial." </p><p> </p><p>"Linhardt, I don't have-... what did you say?" Once his words settled in, Edelgard felt her heart stop for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>"Hm… perhaps artificial might not be the right word for it. It might be more accurate to say that I don't think she was born with it," Linhardt continued, muttering to himself. "I've been studying the samples she gave me and to describe it... Crests are inherently magical even if the people who might have one aren't skilled at it. Even so the magic weaves its way into their very being, but when I study the professor… it feels more accurate to say the magic is <em> over </em> her, rather than a part of her. You could say it's like cooking oil and water in a sense." </p><p> </p><p>"That… Linhardt, how certain are you about that?" </p><p> </p><p>"If I were to have another sample, I suppose I would be able to tell. As fascinating as the professor is, only having one subject to study means I can't compare her to anything else. Maybe if Lysithea actually let me study her, I might have an idea, but as it stands that's my limited hypothesis." </p><p> </p><p>"Lysithea?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Oh, yes, it's quite fascinating, I had a hypothesis that she has two crests, and after some carefully worded phrases, she revealed to me that she did. That being said, she is being quite rude in not allowing me to study her." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard sighed. “Linhardt, I know you tend to ignore social niceties, but even you should be able to understand why a young girl would be put off by your requests to ‘study’ her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, my interest is purely academic. All I want to know is how she came to have two crests. I probably wouldn’t need more than a blood sample to get started.”</p><p> </p><p>“It should also be obvious that there are very few people who would willingly give their blood to someone upon request. Particularly when that someone is a fellow classmate and not a medical professional, and especially when that classmate has a history of hemophobia.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, I see your point. Well, what about you then? Would you be willing to help with my research?”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard paused, then frowned at Linhardt. “...Is that meant to be a request to study my crest then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Both of them, yes. I do recall that you had brown hair once upon a time, Edelgard. Add in how you and Lysithea seem to have bonded lately, and it’s not too hard to put things together. Loss of pigmentation in the hair, stunted growth, strength that exceeds what a minor crest holder should have, albeit magical for her and physical for you, I doubt I need to go on.” He propped his head up on a hand, an actual glimmer of interest in his eyes as he looked at her. “So, are you willing to aid in my research?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Perhaps. My assistance depends on two conditions though.”</p><p> </p><p>He sighed, but nodded, before gesturing for her to continue.</p><p> </p><p>“First, I want you to report to me on whatever you discover about the professor. If our circumstances are similar…” She shook her head. “Never mind. Just make sure to share your findings with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“That does sound annoying…but I guess I could just turn over my notes as reports…but then I actually have to write them so you can understand…” He sighed again. “Sounds like a pain, but sure. Please tell me the second condition isn’t anything too strenuous.”</p><p> </p><p>“It may or may not be. What I want to ask is that you look into if it’s possible to remove a crest.”</p><p> </p><p>That request made Linhardt sit up, the glimmer of interest turning into outright fascination. “Ah…I see, so a crest can be added then…and if that’s the case, why not removed too? Hm…Alright, Edelgard, you have a deal.”</p><hr /><p>Edelgard rapped her knuckles against Bernadetta’s door while leaning close, listening for the startled squeak the shy girl almost always let out when someone came to call on her.</p><p> </p><p>“A-Ah!” And sure enough, there it was. “U-Uh…p-professor? O-Or is it Ingrid? P-Please don’t break my door again if it’s Ingrid!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Well that was concerning to hear. “No, it’s Edelgard.”</p><p> </p><p>“E-Edelgard?! A-Ah, a-are y-you still upset about me following you around!? I-I’m sorry!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not upset, Bernadetta, we already talked about…” She sighed. “May I come in? It feels awkward to speak to you through a door.”</p><p> </p><p>"O-Okay…" A moment later, Edelgard heard the door unlock, and a small scurrying as Bernadetta backed away. Letting out a quiet sigh, she opened the door to find Bernadetta standing in the middle of the room. Well, she wasn't huddled in the corner of her room, so that was good at least. </p><p> </p><p>"Hello Bernadetta. What exactly was that about Ingrid breaking your door?" </p><p> </p><p>"O-Oh, it's n-nothing! Sh-She fixed it so it's a-all good! U-Unless she's angry she had to fix it, and sh-she sent you to deal with me!?" </p><p> </p><p>"She did no such thing, and I certainly wouldn't attack you because someone else broke your door," Edelgard stated, "I actually came by to talk about something important." </p><p> </p><p>"A-Ah, is this revenge for letting the professor get stabbed at the start of the year!? I knew that would come to haunt me!!" </p><p> </p><p>"Bernadetta please, calm down, nothing bad will happen to you I swear," Edelgard assured, trying to speak softly. "I will be claiming the throne of Adrestia soon, and I wish to have your support." </p><p> </p><p>"Y-You will?!" Bernadetta asked, completely surprised. "I-I mean, s-shouldn't you be asking m-my dad? H-He is the minister and a-all." </p><p> </p><p>"Bernadetta, I am aware of what kind of person your father is, he will have no position in the empire I will create. As soon as possible, I shall have him arrested." </p><p> </p><p>"...Y-You will?" Bernadetta asked, sounding very hopeful. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I intend to make sure no one like him will ever be able to rise to power again, and once I do away with the nobility, it shall be that much easier." </p><p> </p><p>"O-Oh…h-hm, well, th-that does sound nice, but why do you want my support?" </p><p> </p><p>"If I am being honest, if this had been at the start of the year, I might not have. Yet you proved my initial assumption of you quite wrong," Edelgard said with a smile, "Time and time again, you fought bravely in battle, despite your fear. Despite what you might think, you are a friend of mine, and I want you supporting me when I am Emperor." </p><p> </p><p>"H-Hm…O-Okay. A-Ah, but wait, if you arrest my father, is he g-going to be put under house arrest or something?" </p><p> </p><p>"Until he is properly charged for his crimes, most likely. Though if you would like, you are more than welcome to stay in Enbarr until he is sent away," Edelgard allowed, before smirking, "I'm sure Hubert will be more than happy to show you around the palace." </p><p> </p><p>To Edelgard’s satisfaction, Bernadetta actually did turn red instead of turning the teasing around on her like Dorothea would. </p><p> </p><p>“…d-do you think he would?” That response was a little unexpected though. "I-I mean, s-since he's so much scarier than everything else, he'll m-make sure nobody t-tries to mess with me, r-right?" </p><p> </p><p>“…heh. He most certainly would,” Edelgard agreed, feeling a smile come to her face at the thought of her intentionally intimidating retainer playing bodyguard to the shy Lady Varley. </p><hr /><p>Entering Abyss was never a pleasant thing for Edelgard. Though it was far better lit and much more spacious than the dungeon she was once trapped in, the memories it trudged up were far from pleasant. Even so, she made the occasional journey down to read from the shadow library, or, in this situation, secure more allies. </p><p> </p><p>"Hello, Constance, Hapi," Edelgard greeted her housemates, the two lounging in the makeshift dormitories the Ashen wolves had made long ago. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Eddy," Hapi lazily greeted as she laid on her bed. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, your highness, to what do we owe the pleasure of you visiting?" Constance said, immediately standing up. "Is this perhaps about restoring my house?" </p><p> </p><p>"...In a sense, it does involve your house," Edelgard started, getting Constance to perk up. "The main thing I want to speak about is that I shall soon be ascending the throne of Adrestria." </p><p> </p><p>"O-Oh, forgive my impertinence, your majesty!" Constance apologized, eyes widening. </p><p> </p><p>"I am not emperor yet Constance. It also wasn't the main thing I wished to speak about," Edelgard stated, locking eyes with her. "Perhaps in another time, your prowess would have surely returned your House to its status as nobility, but once I become Emperor, I intend to do away with the nobility system entirely." </p><p> </p><p>Blinking in surprise, Hapi sat up as Constance stiffened. </p><p> </p><p>"...What was that, Edelgard?" Constance asked, frowning. </p><p> </p><p>"I intend to set a system of merits, one in which anyone can achieve recognition and greatness for their ability. I came down here to see if you two would be willing to support me." </p><p> </p><p>"...Hm." Constance' mouth thinned while she seemed deep in thought. </p><p> </p><p>"...So, I feel like I need to point out, didn't the church help set up the nobility?" Hapi asked, getting Edelgard’s attention. "Won't that piss them off?" </p><p> </p><p>"Even if the goddess herself were to demand it of me, I would not change my mind." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, well, I don't care for the church, so I'm all up for pissing them off," Hapi said, before glancing at Constance. "What about you, Coco?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, hm, hm, hm… I see. So you wish to establish a system in which ability is more important than blood. Well in that case, I have nothing to worry about!" Constance stated, laughing loudly. "My magic prowess is unmatched, so I shall easily thrive under your regime!" </p><p> </p><p>"Are you certain?" Edelgard asked. "You have been spending this entire time attempting to restore your house, have you not?" </p><p> </p><p>"And I shall! I imagine in your new system, you shall still have need of those to take care of territories, do you not? In that case, I shall prove to you that I am worthy of such a role! Be if through Nobility or Ability, my family name shall get the recognition it deserves!" Constance boasted. "Though I must admit, I would have preferred you told me beforehand so I was not making a fool of myself trying to restore my house to its former status of nobility." </p><p> </p><p>"I would not say that," Edelgard said, "...Though, I did have an interest in one of your spells. If I remember correctly, you have one that can change someone's hair color?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course! And I have fully worked out all the kinks it once had!" </p><p> </p><p>"Would you… be able to change my hair color to brown, if just for a moment?" </p><p> </p><p>"That I can! Would you like to have a seat while I grab a mirror?" Constance asked, and Edelgard nodded as she sat down. </p><p> </p><p>Moments later, Edelgard stared at her reflection in the mirror. She saw…a normal looking girl looking back at her. One who didn't carry her burdens. </p><p> </p><p>"Gotta say, you look good Eddy," Hapi complimented. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you," Edelgard said, softly smiling.</p><p> </p><p>“...Hey Coco, would you mind if I borrowed Eddy for a sec?” That made her pause, glancing at Hapi, who looked oddly thoughtful.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Whatever for?” Constance asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Just a thing that popped into my head that I want to talk to her about. Promise it won’t take too long.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…very well, though I will request that you inform me if there is anything that might concern–”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah yeah, I’ll tell you if it’s an important thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Constance huffed at her girlfriend’s dismissal, but left the two alone as Edelgard raised an eyebrow at the redhead. “...What do you wish to discuss?”</p><p> </p><p>“When you were a kid, did you ever get grabbed by a magic lady that ran experiments on you?”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard blinked. Of all things she could have expected her to say… “No…I was not experimented on by a ‘magic lady’. Did something like that happen to you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup. Did you think me summoning monsters whenever I sighed was a natural thing?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Ah. Hm.” Edelgard took a breath. For some reason…she found herself smiling. “I wish we had spoken earlier. It seems I keep finding people I have something in common with at this monastery…”</p><p> </p><p>“Does that mean–No, wait, I think I get it. Little Thea’s also like us, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>She blinked. “Little Thea?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup. You know, since Dororo’s Big Thea.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard tried not to giggle. Something about the blunt manner Hapi said that just tickled her sense of humor in a truly absurd way. “I…You shouldn’t let Lysithea hear you call her that, she would most certainly take it the wrong way.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, good to know for the future. Hm…Mallow?" </p><p> </p><p>"Mallow?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, you know, short for marshmallow. She kinda reminds me of one and she likes sweets, right?"  </p><p> </p><p>“Your reasoning astounds me, Hapi.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you agree then, nice.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard didn't laugh, but she did let out an amused huff. "Why don't we get back to this magic lady you talked about? Can you tell me anything about her?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, right, well… she has like…peach-ish hair and huge tits." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Edelgard wasn't going to ask why that was what stuck out to her. "...Did you hear a name?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…Cleo-something." </p><p> </p><p>"...Cleobulus?" </p><p> </p><p>"Right, that was her name." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…well, from what I know, I wasn't experimented on by her, but by one of her associates. While I am unsure who she disguised herself as, I can assure you, I will deal with her in time. Until then, I am actually planning on working in ways to rid our bodies of what these people have done to us. Your own affliction may be different from mine, but would you be okay with staying in Enbarr so you could potentially be cured?" </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah sure, I’m good with that,” Hapi agreed with a shrug, “I was planning to follow Coco anyway, so this just gives me another reason to head there. Gotta say, I didn't think I would have a chance to sigh freely again. I owe you one Eddy." </p><p> </p><p>"You really don't, especially since I can't guarantee I can fix this." </p><p> </p><p>"Still, if I don't pay you back, Coco will probably get all huffy…hm, I'd probably need to talk to Coco, Dororo, and ByBy first if I offered to kiss you." </p><p> </p><p>"H-Huh?" That certainly caught Edelgard off guard. "...L-Leaving aside Constance, why would you need to talk to Dorothea or the professor?" </p><p> </p><p>"Aren't you dating them?" </p><p> </p><p>“W-What gave you that idea? A-And why do you think I would be dating both of them?? I-I am not…p-promiscuous!”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay? Not sure what that has to do with anything. I mean, the people back in my village were pretty open about stuff. Besides, don’t you emperor types usually have multiple wives?”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s face went scarlet before she let out an exasperated huff. Why did people keep bringing that up? “That doesn’t mean…I-I don’t have time to argue with you. If you want to talk about our mutual experiences later, then I will be fine with that, but if you just want to tease me then I think we better end this conversation here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, alright. See ya, Eddy. Say hi to Dororo and ByBy for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard grimaced before walking off, trying to ignore the heat on her face. She really needed to find a way to handle teasing better…</p><hr /><p>Soon after walking into the stables, Edelgard quickly found who she was looking for as she spotted Marianne gently brushing her horse's mane. Clearing her throat, Edelgard tried to get her attention without spooking the girl. </p><p> </p><p>"O-Oh, Edelgard, hello," Marianne greeted, turning around to face her. "Did you come to check on the horses?" </p><p> </p><p>“I was actually looking for you, Marianne,” she replied, before holding up a hand, “Not for any nefarious reason. I am neither angry at you nor am I here on behalf of someone who most likely isn’t angry at you either.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I…see?” Marianne gave her a confused look. “That is…good to know. U-Um, what did you want then?”</p><p> </p><p>“I was hoping to speak with you about…Towards the end of this month, I intend to travel back to Enbarr and take the throne as the new Emperor. I have been speaking with my fellow classmates on this matter, and I felt you should be aware as well.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I-I see…um…w-why? W-Why tell me, I mean. I’m not an Adrestian noble, I do not see why you would want to tell me about it…”</p><p> </p><p>“...Well, you are still my classmate, and I would like to let you know what is happening. That, and you are still the heir of House Edmund. As the heir to one of Leicester’s noble houses…Are you doing alright?” Edelgard asked as she noticed Marianne shrinking back.</p><p> </p><p>“A-Ah, s-sorry…I, um…I-I d-don’t think…I-I a-am aware of my position, b-but I don’t think I can help you. I-I can’t promise any help from my father and…I-I w-wouldn’t be useful to you…”</p><p> </p><p>"...Perhaps I misspoke, I am not seeking any aid from your father. I know not what man he is, but I do know who you are," Edelgard said, being careful with her words, "I also know that your crest has caused you many problems. Not simply because of the superstitions surrounding it, but also how people view crests." </p><p> </p><p>"...E-Edelgard?" Marianne asked, trembling a bit as she listened to Edelgard’s intense, determined voice.</p><p> </p><p>"I intend to create a nation free of the crest system," she stated, immediately earning a gasp from Marianne. "Long have people suffered because of these 'blessings', whether they have them or not. So I do not want your father's support. I want the support of Marianne, someone who suffered under this system because of something out of her control." </p><p> </p><p>"Th-that… y-you… th-the church…" </p><p> </p><p>"Even if I have to become an enemy of the world, I shall fight until we are free from this tyranny," Edelgard stated, her gaze unwavering even as Marianne was unable to meet hers. "If you do not wish to support me, then I understand. Even so, I promise you that I shall make a world where you do not need to suffer." </p><p> </p><p>"...H-How are you so s-sure of yourself?" Marianne asked. </p><p> </p><p>"...A long time ago, I used to be quite pious myself, fully believing in the church and its ideals. Yet, despite my faith, neither the church nor the goddess protected my family or I. If the goddess does exist, then I am not favored by her. For the sake of my family, and for anyone else who has suffered, I had to remain strong." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Taking a deep breath, Marianne finally met her gaze. "I-I…I want to see the world you'll make. I-I can't promise my father will h-help, but if you can really d-do all that…" </p><p> </p><p>"I promise I will, even if history remembers me as a villain, I swear I will change this world," Edelgard said, before extending her hand. </p><p> </p><p>Staying quiet, Marianne hesitantly raised her hand, before grabbing onto hers, silently giving her support. </p><hr /><p>That was all of them. She had convinced everyone. She was even able to get someone on her side when it came to going against the crest system!</p><p> </p><p>…It was going to take time. She knew it would take time to realize her goals, to guarantee that her friends would not only support her fight against the nobility in Adrestia, but against the whole of Fodlan’s corrupt systems. She had to make sure to fully consolidate her power in the empire before she could declare war against the church, but when the time came, she hoped she would be able to convince them again. </p><p> </p><p>"Ferdinand, how many times do I have to say this? You have to make sure to match the pace of your partner!" Pausing in surprise, Edelgard turned her head to find Ferdinand and Flayn in the middle of dance practice in the gardens. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, my apologies Flayn, I have never actually danced with someone whose stature is so different from mine," Ferdinand admitted, frowning as he looked down at his shorter classmate. "Especially someone who seems to prefer far more traditional dances." </p><p> </p><p>"H-Hmph, I was simply unaware that they performed different dances. It had been so long since I've been to the Empire, so most of my knowledge comes from books I have read." </p><p> </p><p>"No need to worry, that is why we are practicing!" Ferdinand stated before noticing Edelgard. "Oh, Lady Edelgard, hello!" </p><p> </p><p>"...Hello Ferdinand, Flayn. I was unaware you two were practicing on your own." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, that was my idea! Since we were both the 'runner ups' in the voting, I thought it would be fun to practice together!" Flayn said with a smile. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, though I might not have been chosen to be the representative, I fully intend to be dazzling at the ball! Why, I would not be surprised if my entire night is busy with one request after the other!" Ferdinand boasted, before pausing. "Oh, but I'm sure you have something important to talk about with Flayn. If you'll excuse me, I'll give you some time alone." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, Ferdinand-" And he had already left. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, what did you need to speak about, Lady Edelgard?" Flayn asked. </p><p> </p><p>Well…perhaps she should tell her something to keep up appearances. </p><p> </p><p>"I am planning on leaving the academy soon to be crowned the emperor of Adrestia. I have been letting my housemates know." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh… that is a surprise to hear," Flayn said, before frowning. "And a bit saddening if I am being honest." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm?" </p><p> </p><p>"I am sure you will be a wonderful emperor, but it is sad to know you'll be leaving soon. It has been… quite some time since I've had friends, so I was very glad at being able to join the Black Eagles. So to know you won't be here… well, I suppose it would be far too selfish to ask if you could stay." </p><p> </p><p>"..." That was… certainly not what she expected. "...I must admit, I wasn't sure what to make of you joining our class. Especially after the incident with your kidnapping. Though you have certainly surprised me, I certainly didn't expect you to get involved with Hubert's scheme during the Battle of Eagle and Lion." </p><p> </p><p>"Haha, yes, it was certainly quite fun! I've had so many new experiences since joining the class, and I'm glad I've been able to," Flayn said, smiling. "I'm glad that you were my house leader, I shall miss you when you're gone. I doubt I will be able to journey to the Empire any time soon, but I hope we can remain friends!" </p><p> </p><p>"...Yes, that sounds nice," Edelgard allowed, unsure of if she was lying or not. She knew what…type of person Flayn was, in regards to her being a Nabatean, though she couldn’t be sure how much of her persona was a facade. Though, considering that, she couldn’t help but think of how her initial impression of Shez as a complete idiot actually turned out to be right…</p><p> </p><p>“Great! Then I will make sure to write!” Flayn declared, still smiling brightly. It was difficult to believe such a guileless girl could potentially be over a thousand years old, though she wasn’t that good at hiding it either.</p><p> </p><p>"...Flayn, if I may ask, do you and your brother have some…distant relation to the archbishop?" Edelgard decided to ask. </p><p> </p><p>"E-Eh? Wh-what do you mean?" She asked, poorly hiding the truth. </p><p> </p><p>"I am simply thinking…the professor mentioned to me once that the archbishop saw her mother as a daughter. While I'm not sure if they were blood related or not, that would mean you and the professor are family, no?"</p><p> </p><p>"..." A look of realization dawned on her. "...Am I related to the professor?" Flayn asked herself, completely blowing her cover. Not that she realized it. "Oh, that is wonderful news!" </p><p> </p><p>…Maybe she should follow instinct and think Flayn really was an innocent girl, even if she were a Nabatean.</p>

  <p>
  <span>Jeralt let out a slow sigh as he leaned back in his seat. He never liked doing paperwork to begin with, especially with how his aches tended to act up after writing for a while, but now after everything that happened… he felt an ever-growing desire to just retire outright. He was old, he should get to just relax and spend what days he had left with his family…but, no, he had his obligations.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Important obligations too. At the moment, the paperwork stacked on his desk had to do with the Church’s investigations into what was being called the “Agarthan Order”, Rhea’s name for the supposed cult of dark mages that had infiltrated the monastery. Since Tomas had apparently been a different man entirely, that disturbed creep called Solon, there was a push to do some internal investigations into the church staff in addition to the knight’s external investigations into possible places these “cultists” might be hiding. The problem was, the church had a whole lot of staff and there was a big question of how they could even try to test for infiltrators.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One idea was to see if the clergy members could indeed cast faith-based spells properly, out of some assumption that any “heretics” would lack the ability to because they didn’t have faith in the goddess. It sounded like horseshit to Jeralt, but he didn’t have much to go off of himself…Well, he did have some ideas.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Realistically, the only person from that fight he could look into was the sole survivor, “Bias”. The one who hit Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Working off the idea of looking into her specifically, he would want to look for a woman who had an affinity for fire magic. He had no idea of how old she was, what she might look like, or even if she had disguised as someone to begin with, but if he assumed she was someone who worked with Tomas/Solon and came to the church in the same timeframe as him…Hm…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then his door opened, pulling him away from his thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Jeralt, are you busy?” Catherine asked, the blonde knight entering pretty casually.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just with paperwork. Why, what’s up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Rhea wants to see you. I think it’s mainly about the security for the ball that’s coming up, since there’s some concern that something big might happen again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…Well, I can understand that concern. Just because it’s been quiet lately doesn’t mean it’s going to stay that way,” he agreed, before pushing himself up from the desk, “Alright, I’ll go chat with her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, before you go, mind if I ask you something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” He raised an eyebrow at the younger knight, who seemed…kind of awkward, for some reason. “Sure, what is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well it’s just…there’s this rumor that’s been going around, not that I take stock in those kinds of things, but, uh…And, ah, tell me if this is too much to ask, but your late wife, Sitri, right? Was she…Lady Rhea’s daughter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt paused, then frowned. “You know, that question raises a lot of questions. The first one being, why are there rumors about my wife?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, that’s…kind of the thing. They’re not really about your wife, exactly, they’re about Professor Byleth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alright, now he was confused and concerned. “And why are there rumors about Byleth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There were rumors about her since she got here, captain, since there’s that whole thing about a random mercenary from out of nowhere getting made the new professor,” she explained, “As for the new rumors, they’re kind of an explanation for why that might be. Ah, that being that people are saying Byleth is Rhea’s granddaughter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Jeralt pinched the bridge of his nose. “...Who’s saying that, and why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Apparently it started with some of the students, before spreading to the staff. And well…. You know how Manuela is when she's drunk." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I know Sitri and Rhea were close, but if they were related she never told me. As far as I'm aware she was just an orphan taken in by the monastery." And sure, Jeralt might not have kept the closest eye on Rhea, but he was sure he would have noticed if she had a kid…though, that was back when she’d gone by “Theia” and faked her death so “Rhea” could take over…Was the gap big enough for her to have a kid? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sitri did kind of resemble Rhea…There were definitely differences in how they looked, but…though, who would be the father then? He didn’t think she had anyone she was into like that, at least that he noticed, and she really wasn’t the type to have a one night stand...At least, he didn’t think she was?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re thinking about it, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt paused, then frowned at Catherine. “So do you want to know because of your crush on her or what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just because I worship her doesn't mean I have a crush on her!" she denied as her face flushed. Jeralt couldn't help but sigh and feel sorry for Shamir. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I'm not going to say yes. Mainly because I don't think it matters if she is or isn't," Jeralt said as he sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…I’m just saying, it would explain why she puts so much focus on her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, I suppose." It still was difficult to think of Rhea as trustworthy, but… she hadn't attempted anything towards Byleth at all. She might have been pushy at the start, though that could easily be explained… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alright, well, sorry to take your time," Catherine apologized, nodding to him before she left. Letting out a sigh, Jeralt made the quick journey to the Audience chamber. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hello Jeralt, I hope you're doing well today,” Rhea greeted as Seteth gave a nod at his arrival. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As fine as I can be. Gotta say, it's been a while since I've had to do something fancy like protecting a ball," Jeralt responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, it's a bit of a change up for us as well," Seteth stated.,"The Grand Ball is a reward of sorts for the students, so we tend not to have a heavy guard presence around to help keep their minds off of things." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even so, we must make sure to keep them safe. While the building they'll be using for the ball itself will be monitored by the professors who are chaperoning, we need to make sure to have a patrol nearby at all times,” Rhea added, “I trust you've been able to properly plan things out?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I have, though I hope neither of you two mind if I have my own men pick up some of the slack,” Jeralt replied, “With all those knights you're having going around, we're a bit low on men." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I shall make sure your men are properly paid for their assistance," Rhea said with a smile. "Though I apologize for not being able to provide enough knights, the threat of the Agarthans is not one we can ignore."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hopefully we hear back from the knights soon,” Seteth added, “As it stands, the continent of Fodlan is quite large, so it shall take some time for us to be able to find any clues to the Agarthan Order. Perhaps if we had a lead…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… I'm not sure how much it'll help, but they're after Shez, right? We found her in Alliance territory so maybe that's a start?" Jeralt suggested. "She said she lived in Ordelia territory with her mom."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It would, if only things weren't tense in the alliance as it is… if only the Great Houses actually asked us for assistance rather than claim they can handle it themselves." Seteth sighed. "Regardless, we'll keep that in mind. Perhaps we should try investigating the territory bordering Phlegethon and Ordelia?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is as good a lead as any,” Rhea agreed before the door opened, getting their attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, there you are, Captain Jeralt," Flayn greeted with a smile as she walked in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Flayn? Did you need something?" Seteth asked, a bit surprised to see his sister. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I just came by to inform Captain Jeralt that the White Heron Cup is about to begin. Professor Byleth volunteered to dance with the students during the cup, so I wanted to come by and see if you wanted to watch!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She did?" Now that definitely surprised him. "I didn't know she liked dancing." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She's been helping everyone practice for the ball and has been having fun, so I suppose it's not that much of a surprise!" Flayn said with a smile. "Supposedly she even went to get a special outfit for the cup!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My, she certainly is giving it her all, isn't she?" Rhea asked with an amused smile. "I don't suppose it would be much trouble if I went along as well, would it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, of course not Lady Rhea! What about you brother, do you want to watch as well?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose if I must." </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Despite many of the students' trepidations when it came to the White Heron Cup, it was still an event many loved to watch. As such, it was no surprise that all the students, as well as some staff and knights, were there to watch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey dad, over here!" Shez called out, waving over to Jeralt as he entered the reception hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Shez. Looks like you’re not dancing today.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, nah, dancing isn't for me. I mean, I’d probably completely rule if I did go for it, but I figure I should give everyone else a chance to dance,” she replied with a grin. "And that includes Em here!" Reaching over, Shez pulled over the Adrestian. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey, don't pull me!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on Em, just letting you meet my dad, don't think you two ever met." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, I don't think we have. Nice to meet you." Jeralt said, greeting the noble, who craned her head up to look at him. For a brief moment, she squinted her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Are you sure your sister is related to this guy? He's huge compared to her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...She takes after my wife." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I guess that makes sense." Emily said, before scowling as Shez mussed her hair up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry about her dad, she can be kinda abrasive," Shez apologized as Emily tried to push her away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though before Jeralt could say anything else, they heard Alois speak up, announcing the beginning of the White Heron cup, which he would also be judging alongside Manuela and Shamir. Jeralt let out a bit of a chuckle as he heard Catherine congratulate her partner on the position, getting the archer to scowl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Now, as for our representatives, we have, Dorothea from the Black Eagles, Yuri from the Blue Lions, and Emily from the Golden Deer!" Alois announced as the three students walked out to the middle of the reception hall, the former two looking quite confident, while the latter was unable to keep the frown off her face. Which only deepened as her class was the loudest when it came to cheering. "As for who our wonderful participants will be dancing with, we have Professor Byleth who has volunteered to be the student's partners as they perform!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll do my best," Byleth stated with a nod, and a pump of her fist, though for most of the students they focused more on her attire. Specifically that of a dancer's attire, which meant she received a lot of staring, most of whom tried to look away. Aside from the Gautier kid who blatantly ogled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Starting things off will be the Black Eagle House!" Alois announced with Dorothea smiling at Byleth as they both began to dance. Despite her words, it was clear Byleth was still inexperienced compared to Dorothea, since she did her best to lead but almost stumbled before Dorothea caught her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Perhaps we should switch roles, professor? Not that I doubt you, but I'd rather you not end up falling as you try to lead," Dorothea suggested, quiet enough that no one else heard over the din of the music and talking. Nodding in return, Byleth steadied herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that the two changed roles, with Dorothea taking the lead, slowing her pace down to be in step with Byleth. Now moving much smoother, the pair danced together, perfectly in sync.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There we go, professor. Much better, no?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, your movements are easy to follow, thank you," Byleth praised with a small smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No need to thank me~ Though, I would like to tell you that I'm planning on inviting Edelgard to the ball." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, that's great. Glad I could help." Dorothea couldn't help but giggle at her earnest response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, though you should make sure to have a dance with her as well, I'm sure she'll love that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…well, I'm supposed to be a chaperone, but I guess one dance won't be bad," Byleth agreed as they slowed down, coming to a halt as the music ended.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What a wonderful performance! One that will be hard to follow!" Alois praised with a grin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"For the sake of not being biased, I'll just say that was splendid~" Manuela followed up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good work on taking the lead there. You saw a problem and quickly fixed it," Shamir finished, giving the two a nod. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Giving her student a thumbs up, Byleth smiled at her while Yuri walked up. She nodded at the Blue Lion, then the two clasped hands as they began to dance. Almost immediately, it became clear that while Yuri was indeed a skilled dancer, he didn't make much effort to keep pace with Byleth; the teacher plainly had a hard time keeping up as Yuri showed off. Where Dorothea was able to catch her before she stumbled, Yuri instead chose to catch her as she tripped over her feet, making it seem as if he was dipping her down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And here I thought I'd be difficult to sweep you off your feet," Yuri teased, making Byleth huff in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well that was quite the exhilarating performance!" Alois praised, still sounding impressed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That it was, seems our Blue Lion here is quite the leading man,” Manuela commented, before affecting a more critical gaze, “Though I must say, a dance is a duet, not a solo." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It was original, but had a lot of wasted movements," Shamir noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shrugging in response, Yuri rejoined the Blue Lions, who largely seemed grateful that it was over with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, it was time for the final student: Emily, who was notably tense as she walked up. And Jeralt knew his daughter well enough to see her tense up too, before trying to relax herself as they danced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I didn't know you could dance," Byleth said as she led the noble. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if it's hard, it's just footwork, and like you said, I'm light on my feet," Emily grumbled, though she seemed to want to keep the dance simple compared to the other two. And it certainly was a far more simple dance with nothing of note occurring, aside from Emily rushing back to her class as soon as the dance was over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That was a noteworthy performance!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You did well out there, make sure to keep practicing and you'll shine in no time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good footwork." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily scoffed at the praise, putting on a show of indifference, though it was pretty easy to see the slight flush on her cheeks from the praise, which turned outright red when a cheery Raphael gave her a pat on the head. Which also seemed to be a cue for the rest of the Deer to start praising her performance too, though Claude and Hilda seemed to be deliberately trying to fluster her while the rest were being more genuine, with Leonie also giving her a pat on the back and Shez outright hugging her, earning a yelp from the shorter girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And there we have it, folks!” Alois declared once the dances were done, projecting his voice to be heard through the hall, “That was some excellent work from all our participants, and a good job from our professor! But unfortunately, we can only have one winner today, and I think me and my fellow judges already have our choice of winner here! Judges?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well while I would hate to be accused of bias, I genuinely can’t vote for anyone other than the Black Eagle house’s very own Dorothea Arnault after seeing her stunning performance~!” Manuela praised, smiling brightly at her protege.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I have to give it to the Eagles too,” Shamir agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And there we have it! With her stunning start that stole all of our hearts, the winner of this year’s White Heron Cup is Dorothea!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt clapped along with the rest of the crowd, though not nearly as wildly as some of the people in attendance. Even some of the quieter members of the Black Eagles began to cheer, aside from the Vestra kid, who still clapped. Dorothea herself seemed quite proud as she mentioned something about using this win to bolster her career. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Congrats kid, you did great out there," Jeralt said, approaching his kid and giving her a pat on the head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It was mainly Dorothea," Byleth responded, watching while her student was surrounded by her classmates. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right. Also, mind if I ask about the dress?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, the dancer outfit that's part of the prize looks like this. So I thought it'd be fun to wear it," Byleth explained, looking down at her dress. "Though apparently it's not what is usually worn during balls." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, seriously By? Even I knew that," Shez teased as she walked up to her family, "It's gowns and stuff that usually get worn for fancy parties." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, well, this technically is a ‘gown’, I think…Besides, Dorothea thought it looked good," Byleth replied, pouting a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure she would," Shez said, chuckling, "Just make sure to actually wear your normal clothes during the ball. Er, or something more formal. Actually, something more formal would definitely be better." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, I'm just a chaperone so I don't think I'll be dancing much."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You sure? Because I’m pretty sure Dorothea’s bound to ask you. Unless Edelgard gets to you first?” Shez grinned. “Heck, I wouldn’t be surprised if you had a few more admirers willing to ask you after showing your stuff out there!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I'm glad they liked my dancing." Byleth said, not completely understanding what Shez meant. "Oh, I've been meaning to say, but I'll be leaving for a few days soon." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is something wrong?" Jeralt asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, I just need to accompany Edelgard to the Empire for something important. We'll be gone for less than a week."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you guys need any help?" Shez asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, it’s just something Edelgard needs some help with." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, well, make sure to take care, kid," Jeralt said, "Must be important if it's something the princess has to do." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is," Byleth responded, nodding. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor! Come on, we're going to go celebrate!" Dorothea said, grinning as she grabbed onto Byleth’s arm. "You too, Shez! Unless you want to mope about losing." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, who said I was moping! Emily did great!" Shez boasted, chasing the two as Dorothea dragged Byleth away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Watching his kids talking with all the students, Jeralt couldn't help but let out a small sigh. It was different seeing them hang out with so many people their age but… it was a good different. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, you're called the blade breaker, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Looking down, Jeralt found Emily standing by him. "Yeah? Did you need something?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just…wanted to ask if you would be up to training together. You're strong, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I am the knight captain," Jeralt said, a bit amused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Good, then we can train later," she stated as if it was a matter of fact. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, sure sure. Now go on, you shouldn't be hanging around an old man like me, have fun with your friends." Jeralt gently pushed her forward, clearly flustering her a bit before she huffed and walked towards the rest of the students. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well the children certainly seem like they're having fun," Rhea remarked, a smile on her face as she approached Jeralt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. I didn't think Byleth would like dancing so much." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, she did quite well. Heh, watching her, I could not help but think…” Rhea sighed, her smile turning a little sad, “...My mother loved to dance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt blinked. He’d never heard Rhea ever talk about her birth parents. Really, considering her secret, he was halfway convinced she’d been born directly from the Goddess. Though the fact that she was thinking of her own family when looking at Byleth… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...hey, Rhea, do you… think of Byleth as family?" Jeralt asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea paused at the question, not entirely ready for that…especially as she immediately thought of Seteth assuming she had a child of her own… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I would not be opposed if she thought of me as family as well," Rhea said, being careful with her words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, I see…" Jeralt took in a deep breath as he tried to take in the possibility that Byleth was Rhea’s granddaughter…Hm. Did that mean she was his mother by marriage? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That aside, I was planning on having dinner soon if you wished to join me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, sure. I've only had some bread today, so I'm hungry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Jeralt, you need to take proper care of yourself. I would think a captain of the Knight of Seiros would know better,” Rhea chided, making Jeralt pause at the…’motherlike’ tone she had there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>…Maybe, if he ever retired, he wouldn't stick around Garreg Mach. </span>He was way too old to be babied.</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"I must say, seeing you dance was quite thrilling, though if it was up to me, I would have given the win to that young Yuri boy. Your dance together looked quite exhilarating!" Sothis said as Byleth entered her room, ready to retire for the night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Traitor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just because I'm stuck with you doesn't mean I have allegiance to your house." Sothis huffed. "Regardless, you must ensure on the night of the ball that you must dance the night away! If I cannot dance, then you must at least dance for me!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure sure," Byleth agreed, going over to her desk to write in her journal before going to sleep for the night. Though as she did, she accidentally knocked over the box for the pendant. Frowning, she got down to pick it up, before noticing something had slipped behind her desk. "Hm?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Reaching over, she grabbed it, finding it to be an envelope, one that was unmarked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh? I wonder what this is," Sothis wondered as she floated closer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Guess I'll see," Byleth replied, opening it to find a letter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Professor Byleth, </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>First off, I would like to apologize for entering your room without permission and leaving this in here. I found it a tad too embarrassing to talk to you about this in person. I promise I won't touch anything in your room…well, unless it looks interesting. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I kid, of course. Now then, as for what this letter is actually about, I wanted to ask if you would meet me up on the goddess tower on the night of the ball. It's something rather important I want to discuss so I hope to see you up there. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>With love, </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh, it's not signed," Sothis noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It’s Dorothea’s handwriting." Byleth said as she finished reading the letter. "I wonder what she wants to talk about…"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmm…oh! Is there not that legend of two people meeting in the goddess tower to swear an oath together! Maybe this is a confession of love!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No that's not it," Byleth said, shooting that idea down, "First off ,she's dating Edelgard, or will be. Secondly, Manuela said the legend was about a man and a woman, so it doesn't make sense for two women to make a vow up there." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Sothis sighed, before muttering something about a ‘ridiculous child’, which Byleth ignored. Rolling her eyes, Byleth tucked away the letter. She wasn't exactly sure what Dorothea would want to talk about, but whatever it was she would do her best to help. Maybe they were already planning to get married? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Huh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth couldn't help but frown. She wasn't sure why, but she almost felt…disappointed for a moment there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Well, whatever. So long as her students were happy, she would be happy. Though it did raise a question of why Dorothea wanted to meet her at the Goddess Tower. Maybe she had something important to tell her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Byleth mused to herself, Sothis watched her host with a mix of fond exasperation. </span>
  <em>
    <span>How in the world did I end up with a girl who thinks only of others and never herself?</span>
  </em>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The journey to Enbarr was a rather quiet one; two carriages traveled alongside one another through the countryside with Byleth and Edelgard in one, and Hubert in the other. When asked why he was in a different carriage, Edelgard simply responded that he was going to visit his father while they went to the imperial palace. Idly wondering what he was going to do, Byleth spent most of the trip gazing out the window. </p><p> </p><p>With everything that had happened during the year, she hadn't been able to enjoy traveling despite practically going all over Fodlan. The far from quiet marches of her mercenary life seemed like something from so long ago at this point.</p><p> </p><p>"The empire, hm? I don't think we've traveled much there since I've awoken,” Sothis said, gazing out the window with Byleth, "It feels… ancient."</p><p> </p><p>"Hm…" Moving her gaze away from the view outside, Byleth turned to look at Edelgard. "If I may ask, what’s your crowning going to be like?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, officially we will not be proclaiming my ascension as emperor until next month," Edelgard answered, "The actual ceremony usually involves a large celebration that happens all over Adrestria, though that will likely be delayed. As is, all that will happen is my father will pass the crown to me, with a representative of the church being there to witness it." </p><p> </p><p>"Like how Seiros was the one who crowned the first emperor?" Byleth asked, getting Edelgard to nod, albeit with a frown. "Hm… are you sure it'll count with me?" </p><p> </p><p>"It is a bit of a loophole I will admit, as you work at the academy not so much the church, but since you were directly hired by Rhea and also wield a sacred relic, then I see no issue. Besides, I've never been one for traditions," Edelgard said with a smile. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm… you know, this will be my first time back in Enbarr since my first visit." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not surprised, I doubt your father will have been in a hurry to head back. I suppose if there's time, I can show you around." </p><p> </p><p>"That sounds nice. The only place I actually visited was the opera house. And the inn we stayed at, I suppose," Byleth responded, "Though I'm sure you've been to the opera house plenty of times." </p><p> </p><p>"...That I have. My first time there was actually with my uncle, back before he'd been replaced." Edelgard sighed wistfully. "My memory of that performance isn't the clearest, but I do remember enjoying myself. The next time I went though… When I learned that the impostor died, I spent several days in disbelief, thinking that it must have been a lie, and he'd show up one day to drag me back to the dungeons… And when nothing came about I decided to go out, and enjoy the opera.</p><p> </p><p>“Heh, that caused many rumors to go flying back then, about the 'disease riddled' child who couldn't even properly mourn her family's death," Edelgard said, chuckling bitterly. </p><p> </p><p>"...Did you enjoy the show?" Byleth asked, unsure of what else to say. </p><p> </p><p>"Quite, it was a marvelous production. Though I must say, it was quite a surprise to learn several years down the line the star of the production would be my housemate." </p><p> </p><p>"Something I'm sure you enjoyed," Byleth remarked, getting Edelgard to blush. </p><p> </p><p>"H-Hm… my teacher, may I ask you something?" Edelgard inquired, getting her to nod. "Say you were presented with two items: a beautiful ring, said to soothe your worries and a blood soaked axe, said to have fought constant battles, and you were only allowed to take one, which would it be?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Why can I only take one?" </p><p> </p><p>"It's what is expected of you," Edelgard responded, getting Byleth to frown. </p><p> </p><p>"Then I'll take both." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard blinked. "I…professor, that’s not meant to be an option." </p><p> </p><p>"Sure, but I'm a mercenary. It’s only smart to be greedy when presented with potential treasures," Byleth explained, "The axe sounds reliable, and the ring sounds lovely, so it’s smart to take both." </p><p> </p><p>"...why are neither of you making this easy?" Edelgard muttered to herself. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm?" </p><p> </p><p>"Nothing. We're almost to the imperial palace, so make sure to be ready,” Edelgard deflected, trying to keep a blush off her face. </p><p> </p><p>Thankfully for her, Byleth didn't press the topic as they arrived at the castle to find a certain someone already waiting for them. </p><p> </p><p>"Lady Edelgard!" </p><p> </p><p>"Monica?" Surprise evident on her face, Edelgard did a double take as she spotted the redhead approaching them. "What are you doing here?"</p><p> </p><p>"Is it really such a surprise I'm here? I mean, I can't really visit you that often when you're at the Academy, so why wouldn't I come to Enbarr when you mentioned you would be heading back to the empire?" Monica von Ochs answered as if it was the most obvious thing, before smiling at Byleth, “And hello again, professor! You’re looking well!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Monica, it’s nice to see you again,” Byleth greeted with a small wave. "Still not going to join the academy again?" </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you for the offer, but no." </p><p> </p><p>"Aw." </p><p> </p><p>"...Did I miss something?" Edelgard asked as she glanced between the two. </p><p> </p><p>"I asked Monica if she wanted to rejoin the academy when she visited, but she said she was too busy helping you out." </p><p> </p><p>"That I am, ah, but we can catch up later! We should move quickly, your highness, I ensured that Duke Aegir would be distracted so we need to head to the throne room quickly!" </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Monica," Edelgard said, nodding to her before leading the three of them through the palace. She could hear all the servants they passed begin whispering in surprise at the sight of the princess, returned far earlier than expected. </p><p> </p><p>Sticking behind the pair, Monica hung back to let the two walk up the stairs of the throne room together. Awaiting them was a sickly old man, who looked a hair's breadth away from death. Yet even so, his eyes filled with life upon seeing Edelgard, both warmth and regret dancing in them. </p><p> </p><p>"Father, forgive me for making you do this. I understand how much pain you are in-" </p><p> </p><p>"There is nothing to apologize for Edelgard… I am content knowing you are free of that man…" Emperor Ionius IX said with a soft smile on his face, "That I would still be around to see you crowned emperor is more than I can ask for…" </p><p> </p><p>"...Thank you, Father," Edelgard said, trying to keep her tone even. "Now, with my teacher acting as representative of the church, please relinquish the crown to me." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, Edelgard…" </p><p> </p><p>"For the sake of all of the Empire and all of Fodlan, I shall carry this responsibility on my shoulders," Edelgard stated, kneeling before her father. </p><p> </p><p>The Emperor slowly rose from his throne, his limbs struggling with the motion, before he seemed to gain a new life as he moved towards Edelgard and removed his crown, before placing it upon her head.</p><p> </p><p>"By the covenant between the red blood and the white sword, and by the double-headed eagle upon your head, I hereby pronounce you, Edelgard von Hresvelg, the new emperor. Are you prepared to take those responsibilities as your own?"</p><p> </p><p>"...I swear upon this throne, in accordance with the ancient covenant, I swear to use my power to lead Fodlan into a new dawn of peace," Edelgard swore, her voice wavering only for a moment before it hardened like steel with her resolve. With that, The Emperor arose as Ionius sat down. </p><p> </p><p>"My daughter… I wish I could have done more for you. That I could have kept you from being taken away to the kingdom, that I could have kept you safe from Aegir…" Ionius said, regret seeping into his voice. </p><p> </p><p>"...There is no need to say more, father. Your presence was my salvation. The care in your eyes comforted me, and the fury you felt fueled my own. The blood from your clenched fist told me I wasn't alone in bleeding," Edelgard replied, sorrow in her own voice. Silence fell upon the two before Ionius looked at Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"You…are the Ashen Dragon, Byleth Eisner, correct?"</p><p> </p><p>"Ah–" Stiffening at being addressed, Byleth bowed. "Yes, I am Emperor Edelgard’s teacher." </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, for taking care of my daughter…" Ionius thanked, before he began to cough. He raised a hand, keeping Edelgard from going to him before his coughs subsided and he turned his gaze back towards Byleth. "An emperor will need many allies, and I am pleased to know you are hers." </p><p> </p><p>"...I’m glad to be Edelgard’s ally,” Byleth stated, “She has helped me many times, and I believe in her goal." </p><p> </p><p>"...You've helped me far more times, my teacher. Even long before we met." Before Byleth could ask what Edelgard meant, a loud voice sounded in the throne room. </p><p> </p><p>"Your majesty, what are you doing out of your bed chambers?" Duke Aegir practically demanded to know as he approached, before pausing. "Ah, your highness, what are-" </p><p> </p><p>"You misspeak, Aegir. You are to refer to me as your majesty," Edelgard stated, her voice cold and authoritative. </p><p> </p><p>And in an instant, the prime minister went from confused to shocked. "W-What!?" </p><p> </p><p>"It is true, she is now Emperor Edelgard, and an ordinance must be prepared to announce that fact," Ionius said.</p><p> </p><p>"But before that, we must address another issue,” Edelgard stated, turning her glare towards the Prime Minister, “Ludwig von Aegir, for your crime of overstepping your authority, attempting to seize Alliance land, and potentially causing a war between Adrestia and Leicester, I hereby strip you of your title and place you under arrest!" </p><p> </p><p>"That–What are you saying!?" Aegir shouted, attempting to step toward Edelgard only for Byleth to draw her sword and place the tip against his throat.</p><p> </p><p>"Take one step further and I will take that as a sign of aggression against the emperor." </p><p> </p><p>"Y-You! Do you know who I am!?" </p><p> </p><p>"The former prime minister," Edelgard stated, her gaze remaining steadfast. "Guards! Take this man away!" </p><p> </p><p>The imperial guard in the throne room approached the group, aiming their spears at Aegir, who could only shake in rage before he was taken away. He opened his mouth to complain, to rage, before he shut it with a frustrated growl, bowing his head and letting the guards pull him along.</p><p> </p><p>"Heh. I've been wanting to do that for some time," Edelgard remarked, a smile coming to her face as she looked at Byleth, "Thank you, my teacher." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm… what exactly did you mean by me helping you before we met?" </p><p> </p><p>"Professor, do you remember what you told me about being in the Oghma mountains five years ago?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes?" </p><p> </p><p>"My teacher, the man who replaced my uncle, died in the Oghma mountains five years ago. From a sudden rockslide." </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me?" Ionius asked, unsure of what he just heard. </p><p> </p><p>"...oh."  Byleth slowly nodded as Edelgard’s words sunk in and she pieced together what she meant. “...Well, that’s one down then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pff-!” Edelgard stifled a giggle, covering her mouth for a moment before clearing her throat. “My teacher, please do not kill any of the other nobles involved in the Insurrection. I have my own plans to handle each of them, and a few are too useful to be removed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…I’m still going to keep a tally. I don’t have to kill them, we can count it if they’re handled in other ways.” She tilted her head, thinking. “Should I count Duke Aegir already or should we wait for his sentence?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think waiting would be more appropriate,” Monica suggested, “That way if his sentence is death, you can be the one to swing the axe.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, good point. Thank you, Monica.”</p><p> </p><p>"...To be clear, I do not intend for you to become an executioner," Edelgard clarified. </p><p> </p><p>"Still something to keep in mind," Byleth commented, shrugging, "...Will Count Varley have his uses?" </p><p> </p><p>"...At the very least I believe it is appropriate for Bernadetta to be here to decide what to do with him." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, fair." Byleth glanced at Ionius. "Ah, should I help your father back to his room?" </p><p> </p><p>"There is no need," Ionuis responded. "I'll have my guard do so when they return. Thank you for all you have done." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm just glad I could be there for her." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, with that settled, how about we have some tea, your majesty?” Monica offered, “I can have some prepared right away." </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you Monica, that sounds lovely," Edelgard said, smiling at her. "Farewell Father, I will see you as soon as I can." </p><p> </p><p>Giving her father a bow, Edelgard and Monica left, with Byleth following behind, before she paused and looked back at Ionius. </p><p> </p><p>"...Your daughter is incredibly strong, I'm honored to have met her." Bowing deeply, she walked off. </p><p> </p><p>Sitting upon the throne, Ionius could only smile, knowing his daughter was in good hands. </p><hr /><p>The palace of Enbarr was far grander than Byleth had realized, practically dwarfing Garreg Mach with its size. She needed to make sure if Shez was ever here that someone would always be with her so she didn't get lost. Thankfully Edelgard and Monica knew their way around the palace quite easily, and they soon ended up on a balcony overlooking Enbarr while Monica brought out a portable tea set. </p><p> </p><p>"Will Bergamot be okay today, your majesty?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, thank you Monica. And there is no need to call me your majesty, you can still refer to me as Edelgard." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh no, I would never be so presumptuous," Monica replied as she prepared the tea. "Though I must say, I am honored to have been there upon your coronation, I shall make sure to transcribe the events perfectly!" </p><p> </p><p>"Transcribe?" Byleth asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Monica has a perfect memory, and has taken it upon herself to be the historian who writes about me," Edelgard explained. </p><p> </p><p>"To ensure Emperor Edelgard is properly remembered for her grand deeds, I shall write down everything that occurs with her. It is a shame I wasn't there for her year at the academy. If only my father had allowed me to wait another year…" Monica said with a sigh. </p><p> </p><p>"It does seem like a shame, I'm sure it would have been nice teaching you," Byleth said with a smile, “And the offer is still open if you want to join–” </p><p> </p><p>"I think I’ll be fine, professor. Though, perhaps I will be able to learn a thing or two from you when you start working for her?" Monica suggested, trying to placate the earnest professor.</p><p> </p><p>And succeeding, judging by her smile. "I would be happy to." </p><p> </p><p>"You must really like teaching, professor," Edelgard said with an amused smile.</p><p> </p><p>"It feels nice,” Byleth admitted, “Maybe if I ever retire, I might settle down as a teacher somewhere. Though I'm not sure how many places are like the Officer’s Academy." </p><p> </p><p>"There is the sorcery academy in the kingdom, but aside from that, most nobles tend to have personal tutors when they are taught," Monica explained, "I'm sure you'd make quite a fortune as a personal combat instructor to nobles." </p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, it may not be what you're thinking about, but I would hope as my future advisor you weren't already planning on retiring before you ever started," Edelgard said with a pout, before pausing as she heard Monica gasp. </p><p> </p><p>"Is everything okay?" Byleth asked, concerned.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course it is! This is the first time I've seen her majesty pout! Oh I shall make sure to keep that image forever ingrained in my mind!" </p><p> </p><p>…Edelgard could feel a headache starting to arrive. She shook it off though in favor of taking a sip of her tea. “Mm…very well done, Monica.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you flatter me, your majesty! Ah, I’ll have to remember this feeling of being praised…”</p><p> </p><p>“It is very good,” Byleth commented too, prompting a smile from Monica.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad to hear you enjoy it. I have been practicing my brewing in between the other tasks I’ve been carrying out for Lady Edelgard.”</p><p> </p><p>“Other tasks?” Byleth paused. “Ah, is this stuff I’m allowed to know about, or is it confidential information?”</p><p> </p><p>“Considering I intend to make you one of my confidants, I do not see an issue in sharing some of the work I have asked Monica to undertake,” Edelgard decided, “Monica, if you would?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, your majesty! You see, while Lady Edelgard has been busy at Garreg Mach, I have been dutifully aiding her in a search for relics and other items of interest that may allow her reign to progress without issue,” Monica readily explained, in part because Edelgard had already let her know in advance what to say in such situations, “While we don’t expect too much resistance, there is the possibility of a rebellion, or even outside threats causing problems as her majesty attempts to enact her reforms.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…Well, I might be able to help if the Church has a problem with the way you change things, Edelgard,” Byleth offered, and it took all of Edelgard’s self-control to keep herself from breaking out into a massive smile.</p><p> </p><p>Fortunately for her, a distraction arrived in the form of Hubert. “Good day, your majesty. I see your ascension went well.”</p><p> </p><p>"That it did, Hubert, thank you." </p><p> </p><p>"Such a shame for you to have missed it, perhaps if I have time later I can recount it for you," Monica offered, "Ah, but I shall be so busy helping her majesty. Unlike certain people.” </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure Emperor Edelgard’s words will suffice. Unless you claim to speak for her?" </p><p> </p><p>"I resent that accusation." </p><p> </p><p>"So, Hubert," Edelgard cut it before they could continue, "How did your visit to your father go?" </p><p> </p><p>"Tragically, it seems that informing him of your intention to become Emperor was too much for his frail heart and my poor, unfortunate father had a heart attack. And fell down the stairs in the process," Hubert explained with a grim smile on his face. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh my, my condolences Hubert." </p><p> </p><p>"Truly a tragedy,” Monica commiserated, “Perhaps you would like to retire for the night?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, as the new Marquis Vestra I must be prepared to take on the mantle my father left me with his untimely and entirely accidental death." </p><p> </p><p>"You don't really believe that, do you?" Sothis asked as Byleth sipped her tea.</p><p> </p><p>"...Well that's two down at least."</p>

  <span>“Hm…yes, I want that bust over there, where the light will catch it properly,” Acheron Lethe Phlegethon, the newly established conqueror of Ordelia, considered as he looked around his new lounge, “Ah, fix that painting right now! I will not have any portraits of myself be hanging crooked!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His servants hurried to fulfill his commands to remove any trace of House Ordelia from their former castle in favor of images and decorations extolling his own esteemed self! All hints of Ordelia purple and white would soon be dragged away entirely in favor of glorious Acheron yellow!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There you are, Lord Acheron.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Acheron felt a frown come to his face at the interruption, though it soon turned to an ingratiating smile when he realized who was speaking to him. “Ah, Sir Myson! It’s so nice to see you! I wasn’t expecting you to come by! If I did, I would have prepared refreshments!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He glared towards a pair of servants who didn’t look busy enough. “You two, prepare some tea for Sir Myson and his companion immediately!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The servants set down the desk they were moving and immediately leapt to obey his orders, as they should.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Haha, thank you for hospitality, Lord Acheron, but you need not put yourself out for our sake,” Myson demurred with a smile on his pale face, “My associate and I are merely here to ensure you are well supported in this time of transition.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I see!” Acheron let his smile fall for a moment when he noticed how the other warlock with Myson was gazing at his office with a faint frown on his pale face. “And is your guest going to introduce himself properly?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, there’s no need to address Odesse. He is simply my assistant,” Myson explained, prompting a pause from the other warlock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Yes, hello Lord Acheron, I am here to assist,” the man muttered, not even bothering to hide the sneer on his face, which got Acheron to scowl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now see here, I will not be glared at in my own castle!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pray, forgive him, Lord Acheron,” Myson entreated with a small smirk, “He is used to wearing a mask.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Acheron didn’t really understand what that had to do with anything, but he scoffed, choosing to ignore the second warlock in favor of focusing on the powerful mage sent by his benefactor. “Fine, never mind then. I presume you have a reason for coming here again? Does Duke Aegir require something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, his grace has no issues with how you are running things at the moment. We are simply here to confirm things are running smoothly. I see you are settling well in your new residence.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. As well as I can be with this incompetent ‘help’!” he snapped, glaring over at the servants, before turning back to the mages with a simpering smile, “Well you can tell Duke Aegir he has no need for any concern! I have Ordelia fully under my control! It's only a matter of time before those fools give me a seat on the roundtable, and if not, well clearly such a sizable gift to the Empire will grant me the title of count no?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure Duke Aegir will ensure you are properly rewarded regardless," Myson responded, "Though things would have gone much smoother if you had actually captured the Ordelias." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Acheron frowned. "Tell that to the men you provided! Strong though they may be, they're practically brain dead! They were too focused on just causing havoc instead of actually listening to my orders!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll make sure to keep that in mind for when I train the next batch," Myson said, "Though at least they're still providing some use." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, that is true. Why, I think they would make a fine gift to Aegir as well! Even if I don't end up seceding, then it's only proper I establish good relations with my westward neighbors!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You wish to gift our work to Aegir while claiming it as your own?” Odesse asked, offense audible in his voice, which gets Acheron to scowl at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Those soldiers were given to me, were they not? It is my right to do with them as I wish!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Quite right, Lord Acheron,” Myson agreed, “You may use the pawns as you wish. And if that includes trading their services, why not do so?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly! Ah, you have an excellent understanding of how things work, Sir Myson!” He sneered at the warlock’s companion. “You could stand to learn from him, wastrel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Odesse stared at him for a moment, then bowed his head. “My apologies, Lord Acheron, for my presumption.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. You’re lucky I am feeling magnanimous enough to let your insults slide.” He pointed his finger at the upstart. “But do not think my patience is limitless!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course not, Lord Acheron.” Myson smiled. “Now then, I believe a part of our deal was that we be allowed a pick of subjects from the villages in your territory–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, yes, of course, you’ll have your pick of the peasants, though I would prefer you stick to vagrants instead of anyone actually useful. I still need to fill my coffers, after all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll make sure to use discretion in our selections,” the mage agreed, continuing to smile. Acheron could see why Aegir sent him as a representative, the man knew how to properly interact with his better. He admittedly wasn’t sure what exactly these “experiments” the order of mages intended to carry out were, but he couldn’t care less if they had to take a few peasants to carry them out, just so long as it didn’t inconvenience him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As you will then. For now, I have important business to get back to, so if you would–” Acheron paused as the doors were suddenly shoved open, a sneer crossing his face as he glared at the servant that dared interrupt him. “You had better be one of those oafs I sent to get refreshments, or else I’ll–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lord Myson, the Imperial Princess returned to the palace and has claimed the throne,” the messenger in black rapidly explained, ignoring Acheron completely, much to his aggravation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now see here–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ludwig von Aegir has been deposed and arrested as a result.” And that took the wind right out of his sails. “He is currently imprisoned and awaiting trial while Marquis Vestra was eliminated. I believe the newly crowned emperor intends to continue a purge of our assets while consolidating her own power.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So she really has turned against us,” Odesse griped, his eyes narrowed in irritation, “We should have moved to secure her obedience earlier. Wasn’t Bias still keeping an eye on her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She was, though I doubt it was a close one,” Myson replied while disregarding the increasingly pale and sweaty Acheron, “At this point, I consider Bias’s judgement to be compromised. She took her twin’s death poorly, so I doubt she is taking Solon’s demise any better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Hold on, one moment,” Acheron interrupted, “What was that about Duke Aegir being arrested?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The messenger raised an eyebrow, before looking towards Myson, who nodded indulgently. “Go ahead, Keryx, share what you have to share.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Lord Myson. As stated previously, Ludwig von Aegir was deposed and arrested by the newly crowned Emperor Edelgard von Hresvelg.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...th-that–No, hold on, that can’t be right!” Acheron yelped, “W-What does that mean for me!? I-I mean, us! What does that mean for us?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, presumably, the Emperor will declare that she does not support this action of yours, Lord Acheron,” Myson answered, before glancing at the messenger, “I assume she used Aegir’s support of Lord Acheron as the casus for removing the duke from his position.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Lord Myson, that appears to be the case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. She’s grown into quite the cunning little schemer to move so quickly against us..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Acheron swallowed, his dreams crumbling to dust in front of his eyes. Without the empire’s support, he couldn’t possibly stand up to the Alliance! They might even declare him a rebel lord if he stayed on his current course! And if the Empire wouldn’t take him while the lords of Leicester turned against him… “W-Well, Sir Myson, thank you for visiting today, but I really should get back to work! I, ah, have some letters to send to Count Gloucester, simply important correspondence, a matter between lords, that sort of thing–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, when I heard you were called ‘The Weathervane’, I thought it meant you had some sense of self-preservation, Acheron,” Myson commented, regarding the ambitious minor lord with far less amusement than he had up until that point, “Are you truly so stupid that you’d try to turn on us while we’re right in front of you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–How dare you! Do you have any idea who you’re talking to?!” Acheron demanded, his anger at being insulted overriding his concern, “I am Lord Acheron Lethe Phlegethon! This is my castle, and I will not be insulted inside of it! Guards! Remove these men from my presence immediately!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Guard! GUARDS!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Acheron scowled, glaring around the room at the guards that should have been moving to aid him, but were instead just staring at him with…With contempt? And as he looked around, he started to notice the servants in the room with him had stopped working in favor of staring at him too, before one maid glanced at Myson. “Lord Myson, your orders?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Disperse. There is no need to keep up this charade any further, especially now that this beast has outlived its usefulness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, my lord.” Acheron’s own servant bowed, before a flash of dark magic caused the woman’s skin to turn a pale white as her clothes shifted into dark robes, a change that continued with every person present as Acheron slowly realized he was surrounded by dark mages and knights that had disguised themselves as his castle staff.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What? W-What in the world is this!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You did not honestly think we would trust a beast of your reputation so readily, did you?” Myson asked, some amusement showing at Acheron’s growing fear, “We already had to deal with Aegir pushing his boundaries with us, and I had no intention of allowing that to happen again, not when we’ve invested so much into this project here.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He smiled, and it was a cruel, sadistic thing that lent true malice to his pale visage. “I had planned to replace you eventually, but I didn’t expect the time to come so soon. Odesse, if you would?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Hold on, this is why you brought me?” Odesse grimaced. “I have to look like that…thing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I need a man with a firmer spine to play his role,” Myson noted as Acheron tried to back away, sweat running down his face as it dawned on him just how much danger he was in, “I realize it is not as much time as you could have had to learn his mannerisms, but then we do not need an exact mimicry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-W-Wait, wait, h-hold on! Y-You can’t seriously be thinking of killing me!” Acheron insisted, because for all his faults, he could at least recognize a threat to his own life. “I-I–Y-You don’t understand, I’m useful! I-I’m incredibly useful! I am the lord of the rivers, I-I control the Great Bridge of Myrddin, I can be of great use to you! I-I have powerful friends!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I am well aware of that,” Myson replied as Odesse started to approach the craven lord, dark magic gathering at the younger warlock’s hands, “The fact that you have value is the whole reason we are doing this. Otherwise we would have simply disposed of you outright.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What!? N-No, no, stay back!” Acheron demanded, before yelping as his back collided with his desk. “A-Ah–n-no, no, you can’t do this, not to me! I-I am Acheron! I-I’m meant for so much more than this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I agree, Acheron.” Myson smirked. “The man called Acheron will indeed play a very important role in the coming days. Do not worry. I will make sure your name goes down in history.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Acheron would have screamed, but then Odesse’s hand was on his face, and all he saw was darkness.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"So, how do you feel, 'Lord Archeron'?" Myson mockingly asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh, don't call me by that beast's name," ‘Acheron’ complained, glaring at Myson as he seemed to try to ease any aches in his flesh, "You really couldn't have found me a better body?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Probably, but this was the best option, especially since just disposing of him would leave too many questions." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"At least I don't have to act like him," Acheron muttered as he felt his face to make sure everything fit well. "I am definitely getting rid of this mustache." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just don't make it too obvious that something has changed. The last thing we need is that Imperial brat to come down on us."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. What if we fake some sort of traumatic event? Give my character a ‘reason’ to change so drastically, perhaps?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson laughed. “You mean like having his body stolen from him? If you want to fake an assassination attempt, go ahead, though do try to get some further utility from it outside of simply getting rid of the mustache.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t need to be an assassination, just something sufficiently traumatizing. Maybe we could let a demonic beast loose and have it as an excuse to collect materials? Or perhaps I’ll just change because of my changing fortunes, hm? I am meant to have grown a spine, so perhaps a change in looks would be conducive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re meant to be stubbornly digging your heels in, not transforming into a warrior prince.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t planning to go that far,” Odesse complained, before grimacing as he examined his new face in the reflection of a window, “Ugh…maybe I could start wearing a mask?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you plan to start calling yourself the Flame Emperor then?” Myson mocked, before pausing as a thought occurred. “Hm…now that might be a point of interest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Using the Flame Emperor? I thought the rat had turned against us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She has, but nothing says we cannot use that identity to our own ends. It would be useful if we could reveal her 'identity' after using it for our own ends. Show her the price for turning against us." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm… fair point. One problem though." Myson raised an eyebrow at Odessa. "I'm not as short as her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Clearly we would be getting someone else," Myson responded, calling him an idiot under his breath, "That Kronya girl would be a good choice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because she’s short?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but also because she’s a vicious and unsubtle sadist who is entirely loyal to our cause. She would never hold any sympathy for the beasts, nor allow personal attachments to make her loyalty waver in the same way Bias has.” He smirked. “She’ll be perfect.”</span>

  <span>Shez had to admit, it was kind of weird not having Byleth around. It wasn’t the first time the two of them had been apart for a while, especially when they had missions to do for the church, but that was part of what made it weird. Her sister hadn’t left in the middle of the month before, so it felt kind of weird, especially since she kept what she was actually doing over in Enbarr a secret.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps she eloped?” Arval offered half-heartedly, which earned an immediate frown from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Byleth wouldn’t do that. Besides, if she did, she’d invite me to the wedding.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I doubt you know what elopement means." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, of course I do! Even if it was a secret marriage, By would tell me!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose that is fair…perhaps they are conspiring together?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What would they be ‘conspiring’ about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who knows? Perhaps they aim to conquer the world?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pff, By wouldn’t do that. And I don’t think Edelgard would either? She’s kind of intense but she’d probably stop at just conquering Fodlan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That…why is that your logic?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It makes sense, doesn’t it? I mean, if she wanted to conquer the world, she could have killed that Almyran prince and started a war with Almyra. That could have led to conquering them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm. There is something unnerving about you using logic." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shut up. Anyways…hm, By’s supposed to be getting back today, I think…maybe I should try to go find her ahead of time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll get lost,” Arval bluntly stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–I won’t! Probably!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then glanced over to the entrance of the classroom. “Oh, hey Dimitri. Why are you over here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I heard you talking to yourself,” he replied, “Why are you hanging around in your classroom? Classes should be over already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well yeah, they are, but I don’t have anything better to do and I didn’t feel like training.” She crossed her arms over her chest. “I guess I could’ve hung out with someone, but everyone’s pretty busy getting ready for that ball dance thing. I guess I should too, since Hilda, Mercedes, and Dorothea are gonna be helping me with that, but also the way they smiled at me earlier filled me with dread for some reason…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I can understand that. I've never been one for balls myself. Why, the only time I enjoyed dancing was with…an old friend of mine." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, when I was young she taught me how to dance. It… was a long time ago, but I look upon that time fondly." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, what, was she your first crush or something?" Shez had to admit, that was the first time she saw Dimitri recoil in visible disgust. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please, don't suggest such a thing again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “Eesh, did things end that badly between you two?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s…You are aware that I had a step-mother, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, my step-mother had a daughter, and while I do not know the full circumstances of what occurred, I consider her daughter more of a sister to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ohhh. Oh! You’re like me and By! Well minus the step-mother part, since her mom’s dead too.” Shez paused for a moment, because she was pretty sure Dimitri’s step-mom was also dead, but she probably shouldn’t bring that up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could it be? Have you actually learned tact? It’s a miracle!” Arval snarked, prompting a frown from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, you shut up, I know what tact is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Er, Shez?” Dimitri said, frowning slightly, “I did not say anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh. Uh, whoops, heh. Guess I just, uh…” Shez wracked her brain for a good excuse. “...I probably heard the voice of the goddess! Because…this is a monastery!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sound of Arval’s palm meeting their face went unheard by Dimitri, though it was extremely audible to Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Shez, forgive me for bringing this up, but I believe you once mentioned having a voice in your head?" the prince mentioned, which made Shez stiffen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…oh, right, I think I did…Yeah, back with the Almyran thing, huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is truly a miracle you can keep any secrets,” Arval chided while Dimitri seemed…almost relieved?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see…Shez, I would like you to know that you’re not alone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well yeah, I know that–” Shez paused as his meaning registered. “Wait, do you have a weird ghost person that follows you around and tells you to kill people?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval scoffed, offended. “I do not tell you to kill people! I offer prudent advice depending upon your circumstances!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! Exactly–Well, not quite exactly that, it is less a single ghost and more…” Dimitri cleared his throat. “My apologies. I just…I’ve been haunted for such a long time and to know another shares my circumstances…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused. She hadn’t really considered how weird and potentially distressing it would probably be for someone else to be haunted by a strange ghost person. Though Byleth didn’t seem too bothered by hers…then again, Byleth didn’t get bothered by much. “Hey, it’s okay! I get it, it’s weird and annoying having a ghost talking to you all the time–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How am I weird and annoying?” Arval complained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–but I’m sure you can get a handle on them! What’s your weird ghost like anyways?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah, well…I hear the voices of my father, step-mother, and best friend telling me to avenge their deaths,” Dimitri explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, wow, that’s heavier than I expected. Though I guess Arval does try to get me to fight Byleth, so I can understand that part,” Shez said, earning a worried glance from Dimitri.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The ghost haunting you tries to get you to kill your sister?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ehhh…kind of? Kind of…It sounds worse when you say it out loud like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Er…sorry?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no, it’s fine, I just try to ignore them when they get like that anyway. Uh, so! You’ve got a vengeance quest, that makes sense, I know about that whole Tragedy thing–Uh, not to downplay it, I just...So! Any guesses on who might’ve done it? Do you have an evil uncle? Oh, or some kind of sinister advisor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri blinked, before frowning. “Shez, my life is not a storybook.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, sorry, I know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I actually came to the academy hoping to find some clues on that subject, actually,” he admitted, “I’ve tried looking within Faerghus, but my own investigations have been fruitless. I…I don’t know what, precisely, I thought I might find here, but…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hey, Dimitri, just a quick question, but why did you think Garreg Mach would have the answer you’re looking for?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” He sighed. “I…I don’t think I can answer that here. There’s a reason, but it’s a long story to explain it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, hey, I have time.” Shez smiled up at him. “I’m just hanging around anyway.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I appreciate the offer, but…some other time, alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well well well, what do we have here?” Claude said with a smirk as he entered the classroom, catching Dimitri off guard and earning an amused look from Shez, “The Blue Lions House leader coming by to try to poach everyone’s favorite purple-haired merc back to his class? Or were you just looking to invite her to the dance, hm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri sighed. “Neither, Claude. We were just talking.” Then his eyes narrowed. “And I do hope you weren’t listening in on our conversation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Me? Would I do that? No, that doesn’t sound like something I would do. I was just coming by to make sure you weren’t running off with Shez. It seems like there’s been a trend of royals eloping around here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez scoffed, audibly amused. “Why does everybody think By eloped? I know it’s obvious Edelgard has a crush on her, but Byleth’s not the type to just run off with someone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri blinked. “She does?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah? I mean, it's pretty obvious to me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…she did have Hubert in a different carriage instead of having him ride with her and Teach," Claude noted, eager to get the rumors flowing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's completely inappropriate! What would Seteth or the Archbishop say!?" Dimitri suddenly snapped, earning confused looks from Claude and Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Uh, Dimitri, it's not a big deal, we're just joking around." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, nothing’s wrong, no need to shout. Besides, By likes Dorothea, so-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So she's leading her on!?" Dimitri questioned, his brow furrowed in anger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez and Claude glanced at each other before the former spoke, “No? I mean, By doesn’t tell me everything about her love life, probably since I pester her over it because it’s funny, but she wouldn’t lead anyone on, she’s not like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve also gotta ask why you seem to care so much, Dimitri,” Claude said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course I care! I’m her br–Uh, I mean, it is…important for…Th-The academy has standards that should be upheld.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez just looked all the more confused. “Wait, since when were you such a stickler for propriety?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Since always, obviously. I have always been like this, clearly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude, meanwhile, felt both his eyebrows raise before he managed to school his expression. “...Well hey, if you want to talk to the professor about propriety, you should probably head over now. She and Edelgard should be getting back any second now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, really?!” Shez pushed herself up from her desk. “She’s back?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I said she’s coming back, not that she’s–and there she goes.” Claude watched as his friend practically vanished from sight, traveling as fast as she could go in a flash of violet light. “You know, I really should ask her more about those powers of hers one of these days. So, Dimitri, are you–And he’s gone too. Hm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His reaction might’ve implied his princeliness had a crush on Edelgard, but Claude had a feeling it was something else, in part because he really was eavesdropping and caught a good part of that conversation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fodlaners really needed to learn to talk in private areas when they didn’t want people to overhear them.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"My teacher, before we arrive at the monastery, is it okay if I ask a favor of you?" Edelgard asked as the carriage arrived at the town outside Garreg Mach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, what do you need?" Byleth answered without hesitation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I do believe I mentioned I had something I wished to inform you about, correct?" At Byleth’s nod, she continued. "If possible, would you be willing to meet me at the Goddess Tower on the night of the ball?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, why?" Huh, Dorothea also wanted to meet her there. Was it related?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is…a special place to my parents. You may take it as foolish, but I think being there will give me the strength for what I need to tell you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Okay," Byleth agreed, nodding as she saw the serious look on Edelgard's face, though she was internally trying to figure out why Dorothea </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> Edelgard wanted to meet her in the same place. She could also faintly hear an exasperated noise from Sothis, for some reason. "I'll make sure to-" Then both Byleth and Edelgard jolted as the door was suddenly yanked open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey there By!" Shez shouted, grinning at the two from the doorway. "Did everything go well?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yes, it did. Why did you yank the door open?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What am I not supposed to be excited to see you?" Shez asked, before turning to Edelgard. "Hey, quick question, you two didn't elope, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...W-What!?" Edelgard asked, her face burning at the sudden question. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez, I'm not even dating anyone, why would I suddenly elope?" Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's what I thought! But, well, rumors started flying around and well-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor! I must speak with you at once!" Blinking, Byleth looked out to see Dimitri rapidly approaching the carriage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure?" Byleth said, not sure what was going on while Shez winced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Dimitri, please don't-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, explain your promiscuity at once!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...My what?" Byleth asked, completely confused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Her what!?" Edelgard yelped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Any relations you might seek to chase are your own business, but as the professor of this academy you must uphold standards!" Dimitri shouted as Shez tried to push him back, to little avail as Byleth remained confused about what was happening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Things only continued to get worse as thanks to this happening in a very public place, Byleth found herself getting dragged away by a very stern-faced Seteth who wanted some explanation for why Dimitri was yelling at her about her promiscuity. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Heh, it sure looks like you were dragged through the wringer," Jeralt said, chuckling when he saw an exhausted looking Byleth slumped on a table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't know what I did…" Byleth complained as she looked up at her father, "Apparently people think I'm promiscuous?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That earned a pair of raised eyebrows. "Really?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, so Seteth started lecturing me for several hours, but just when I thought I was free, Raphael walked by and congratulated me on the wedding for some reason. Which just set off Seteth again…" Byleth sighed. "Why are people thinking I eloped with Edelgard?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah… well, you know how rumors are," Jeralt replied, not completely understanding it either. "So, aside from that, is everything good?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, everything was handled well," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, you sure? You seem down," Jeralt noted, sitting down across from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I do?" Byleth asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well of course you do, you've been tense since learning that student of yours is leaving the academy," Sothis piped in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah… hm… hey, Jeralt… how would you feel if I were to suddenly move away?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Well, I probably wouldn't be happy about it, but you're an adult, and you can make your own decisions," Jeralt responded. "But we can always see each other again. Unless you want to run away from me specifically." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wouldn't do that," Byleth immediately denied, frowning deeply, "Just…I've been feeling tense lately, and it's weird. It's not like anything else I've felt." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, it would help if you told me why you were feeling like this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…" Pausing for a moment, Byleth considered her words. "A student of mine is withdrawing from the academy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aaah. Well, it's obvious that you're gonna miss them. I mean, you've gotten pretty attached to your students, haven't you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I… think so," Byleth said, frowning. "...Hey, Jeralt, do you know if my contract with the academy will end when the academy year ends?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, you know, I'm not sure. I would imagine they'd make sure to find someone to take over your role, but I don't think they've been looking… honestly wouldn't be surprised if Rhea just assumes you're just going to be sticking around for the long haul." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…" That was… different. She had just assumed her contract would end when the year ended, but if there wasn't an actual end until they found a replacement… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on kid, no need to look so down. That ball is happening tomorrow, right? So best get ready for it to make it a good night." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I… guess, yeah," Byleth agreed, frowning as she got up. She needed to have a talk with Rhea after the ball. As much as she liked teaching, she had plans for her future, and they didn’t involve staying at Garreg Mach for her entire life.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“I do apologize for the inconvenience my departure may cause the Academy, but I feel ascending to the throne of Adrestia is the only reasonable action I can take at this time,” Edelgard explained, before bowing her head to the archbishop, “I hope for your understanding in this time of transition, and I thank you for all you have done for me while I attended the Officer’s Academy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I second her majesty’s words,” Hubert said, bowing his head too and barely hiding the smirk on his face, “Thank you for the many opportunities you have given us while we attended your esteemed institution.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea smiled, nodding to the two students in turn. “You are quite welcome, children. I am glad to see the positive impact the Academy has had on both of you, and I understand the circumstances you were faced with. I can only offer my praise in how you handled the avarice of the former Duke Aegir and my condolences that your school year was cut so short. If you wish to return for the graduation ceremony at the end of the year, I would be happy to host you once more.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then I look forward to seeing you then, Lady Rhea,” Edelgard said as she straightened. A part of her considered the idea of bringing the Imperial Army with her to that reunion, before discarding it as far too mean. Though Hubert would probably be all for it…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have to say, this is highly irregular, though I suppose we should have expected something like this might happen given the royal heirs we were hosting this year,” Seteth commented, “I presume you have already decided who will take over for you as the Black Eagles House Leader?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I intend to pass it to Ferdinand. He is a good friend and I believe he will be a worthy leader.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A fine choice,” Rhea said, still smiling, “I imagine the young heir of Aegir would be happy for the opportunity to redeem himself following his father’s poor choices.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard had to stop herself from pointing out that his Father's actions weren't his own. For now, she just nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose we'll make an official announcement during the ball?" Seteth suggested. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That would be as good a time as any," Edelgard responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If I may, I wish to thank you," Rhea spoke up, surprising Edelgard. "It may have been fate, but you and the other house leaders brought Jeralt and his family here. For that, I owe you greatly." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I would agree, having the professor here has been quite the boon. I have learned many things from her," Edelgard replied, meeting Rhea’s gaze, "Perhaps with her help, we can help mend the relationship between the Empire and the Church. If at all possible, I was seeking to reestablish the Southern Church." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh?" That seemed to surprise Rhea. "That is a surprise to hear, though not an unwelcome one. I understand the Southern Church caused many issues in the past, so it pleases me to hear you're willing to work past that."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course. I'll make sure to write once I have proper candidates for the position," Edelgard said, bowing to the Archbishop before she and Hubert turned around to leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Perhaps that second bow was a bit much, your majesty," Hubert noted once the doors closed behind them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As long as it keeps up appearances," Edelgard responded, "But for now, let's just enjoy ourselves, the ball tomorrow will likely be the last peaceful day we'll have for some time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph. I have no idea how peaceful it will be, given how busy I will be fending off anyone who wishes to dance with you," Hubert muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come now Hubert, I'm sure even you have someone you wish to dance with." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"None that I would be willing to forsake my duties." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There you are, Edie, Hubie!" Dorothea greeted, waving as the two before grabbed Edelgard’s arm. "Come on, I want to hear all about your trip~" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Need I remind you just who you're grabbing onto, Dorothea?" Hubert asked with a warning tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why, I'm just grabbing onto our dear Edie. Unless there's something you want to announce to everyone~" Dorothea teased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's all right, Hubert,” Edelgard assured, “And there's nothing to say, Dorothea." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so~? Well, either way you and I need to get ready for the dance! Unless you have someone else you'd like to take as a date~?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"D-Dorothea?" Feeling her face grow flushed, Edelgard looked away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not hearing a no," Dorothea teased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, there you are, Lady Edelgard!" Ferdinand greeted, a smile on his face as he was followed by the Black Eagles. "I had heard you arrived, but I had yet to see you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She probably just wanted to rest after her long trip," Lindhart muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But she was in a carriage, why would she need to rest?" Caspar asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Apparently Didi came marching up to her carriage yelling about something, so maybe that's it?" Hapi suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-Was everything okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There is nothing to worry about Marianne, Dimitri simply misunderstood something," Edelgard responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I hope the professor is okay,” Flayn said, “I heard that my brother gave her a very long and stern lecture, so I hope she is not too tired."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The professor is very strong, a lecture will not defeat her!" Petra declared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hm, Seteth isn't that bad, right?" Bernadetta asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even if he has gotten victory over our professor, I have just the spell to make sure she can power through any lecture next time!" Constance added with full enthusiasm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That would have been helpful earlier,” Byleth remarked, walking up to the group. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, there you are!" Ferdinand greeted with a smile. "Thank you for assisting Lady Edelgard on her trip!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's the least I can do. I'm just glad we could get back in time for the dance."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, tomorrow might be the last time I'll be able to be with all of you all at once," Edelgard noted, "As such, I have a proposition. In five years time, the millennium festival will occur, why don't we all make sure to meet here again?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ooo, a class reunion, that sounds fun~" Dorothea commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That it does! I shall likely be staying here at Garreg Mach with my brother, but I'll make sure to greet you all warmly when you visit!" Flayn said with a bright smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That sounds great!” Caspar agreed, “We'll make it the biggest party around!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I-it does sound lovely." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"B-Bernie isn't going to be left out!" Bernadetta declared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even if I must swim the ocean, I shall return!" Petra agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I suppose that I could pry myself away from however busy I will be to visit you all!" Constance decided, prompting a nod from Hapi.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If Coco is in, I'm in too."  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I would be remiss to miss such an event, and I swear my dance moves will outshine even you Dorothea!" Ferdinand boasted, getting Dorothea to let out an amused huff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It sounds like a pain, but you guys will probably be more annoying if I try to skip out," Linhardt mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, it seems that is everyone then," Hubert noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not everyone yet." Turning her gaze towards Byleth, Edelgard smiled. "How about it, professor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...yeah, that sounds great. No matter what, I'll make sure to be here," Byleth agreed, returning the smile. It was a promise she intended to keep. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>There were times when Byleth wondered how she would have done if she had joined the monastery as a student instead of a teacher. Usually those times related to her wearing an Academy uniform, either because her sister and students wanted to see how she would look in one, or in circumstances like these where she didn’t have that many formal clothes and so elected to wear a formal uniform instead of spending her money on something fancier.</p><p> </p><p>She did add a black shoulder cape to her own version of the uniform, mostly to set herself apart from the students. Not that she really needed to, considering she knew who she was and she did still have her sword at her side. She did kind of prefer the silver version of the uniform her sister had got her though…it just felt like a nice personal touch. Though she could add some pink to it instead, that might be cute…</p><p> </p><p>"I must say, it's certainly interesting how the most self-interest you show is when it comes to fashion," Sothis noted. </p><p> </p><p>"It feels nice being pretty." </p><p> </p><p>"Certainly. I shall not deny that wearing clothes you like is something everyone enjoys." </p><p> </p><p>"Hey there, By!" Shez greeted, making the two look over at her and pause, their eyes widening in surprise. Rather than her uniform or her normal clothes, Shez was wearing a full ball gown, one that was a mix of royal purple and silver that cinched at the waist with a violet sash and poofed out at the skirt. Her hair was also curled into ringlets, and she seemed to be wearing blush and eyeliner too. "What do you think?" </p><p> </p><p>"You look very pretty," Byleth said, smiling as she gave her sister a thumbs up. "Though I think I might have underdressed for this…" </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, no come on By, you look good!" Shez reassured, prompting a hum from Arval.</p><p> </p><p>“You <em> are </em> far better dressed than she is."</p><p> </p><p>"Arval, come on, you know I'm all for competitions, but this isn't one of them," Shez said, frowning at her friend.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, this spirit your sister hosts certainly has quite the nerve if they're commenting on your sense of fashion," Sothis muttered, making a guess on what Arval had said. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm. Shez, if Arval is saying anything rude about my clothes, tell them to shut up," Byleth requested, catching everyone off guard. "Dorothea said I can dress how I want." </p><p> </p><p>"Pft- well, you heard her Arval." </p><p> </p><p>"I was not-..." Arval took a deep breath. They would choose their battles wisely and not get into an argument with children. "Shez, please tell your sister I am sorry for disparaging her clothes. She looks lovely." </p><p> </p><p>"Arval thinks you look cute,” Shez said, prompting an aggravated sound from the pale spirit.</p><p> </p><p>"Aw, is the disparaging spirit just shy~?" Sothis teased, even if only Byleth could hear her. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Arval," Byleth said, before focusing on Shez. "Now come on, we should get to the ball." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, right, I am getting paid so gotta make sure I actually show up!" </p><p> </p><p>"Paid? Paid for what?" Byleth asked, though Shez moved ahead as quickly as she could in the dress before she got an answer. "...Hm." </p><p> </p><p>"If nothing else, your sister can take care of herself, so no need to worry," Sothis assured as Byleth followed behind her sister. </p><p> </p><p>“Mm…alright,” Byleth replied, before walking out into the crowd of students. She wasn’t the only one who wore the formal uniform, though she did notice a few students had chosen to dress up in even fancier clothes, so Shez wasn’t alone in her ball gown. </p><p> </p><p>Immediately, she could see Annette and Mercedes had dressed up, the former wearing a blue gown and chatting cheerfully at Felix, who seemed to be at least paying attention to her, while the latter wore a modest, light-brown gown and had her hair unbound from its usual side-tie as she danced with Dedue. Nice to see the Blue Lions were having some fun, though Byleth couldn’t help notice Sylvain striking out pretty badly in trying to ask another student to dance while Ingrid clearly decided she would prefer to stick by the buffet instead of bothering with a date.</p><p> </p><p>As for Ashe, Byleth idly noted that he seemed to be hanging out with Yuri and Balthus…possibly not entirely by choice, if judging by his somewhat uncomfortable expression as Balthus regaled him with some tale of his adventures. Byleth was a little concerned, but Ashe gave her a small smile and a signal that he was okay when she looked worried, so she decided to just leave it for now. She did make a note that Yuri had decided to dress up though, wearing an ostentatious all-white suit, while Balthus had actually put on a shirt. Good to see he was getting into the formal spirit of things.</p><p> </p><p>As for her own class, Byleth did feel a slight frown come to her face when she noticed Hubert and Linhardt were just wearing their normal uniforms, but, then again, did she really expect any better?</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea looked good though, especially because she had decided to wear the dancer outfit she had won from the White Heron Cup. It looked good on her, and it seemed many people agreed judging by the amount of admirers she had. Not that Dorothea was paying attention to that; instead, she seemed to be encouraging Caspar and Petra to dance together, a happy smile on her face as she made sure they both knew what they were doing.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth briefly considered that she should have worn her own dancer’s outfit to the ball, and probably would have if she knew it was an option, before discarding that thought in favor of continuing to check on her students. As one might expect, Ferdinand had dressed up for the occasion, wearing a crimson suit with white pants as he led Flayn through the steps of the dance, smiling encouragingly at her while she gave her best effort to follow his movement.</p><p> </p><p>Also extremely expected and obvious was seeing Hapi and Constance together, though Byleth was a little surprised to see Hapi had dressed up for the occasion. Probably at Constance’s urging, considering their dresses seemed to match in style, though not color; green and black for Hapi, and pink and blue for Constance.</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t the only girl-girl pairing at the dance either, as Byleth spotted Marianne with Hilda. The blue-haired Eagle was just wearing her formal uniform, but the pink-haired Deer had dressed up in a pink, red, and black dress of her own, her hair done up differently from her usual twintails and a faint blush on her face as she guided Marianne through their dance.</p><p> </p><p>They looked like they were having a nice time, so Byleth just left them to it as she scanned the room, looking to spot the last of her eagles. Along the way, she did notice Raphael had joined Ingrid at the buffet and the two had gotten to some lively chatting while Ignatz seemed to have been dragged into the conversation with Balthus, Yuri, and Ashe. At least the latter seemed relieved to have someone else dealing with the Wolves. </p><p> </p><p>As for Leonie, Byleth felt a slight flash of surprise as she saw her father’s apprentice practically pulling Lorenz onto the dancefloor, the purple-haired and purple-suited noble seeming just as bewildered as Leonie insisted he owed her a dance. For what, Byleth wasn’t sure, but hey, it wasn’t her business. Unless the two started making out, then she was pretty sure she had a responsibility as a professor to stop that from happening.</p><p> </p><p>Probably not something she needed to worry about though, at least from those two. Now, as for Bernadetta…</p><p> </p><p>Byleth frowned to herself, before heading over to one of the tables and peeking under the tablecloth. She didn’t find Bernadetta under there, which was both kind of a surprise and kind of a relief, though now she felt a little concerned…up until she noticed the easily frightened Eagle fidgeting with the purple gloves of her gown, her usually messy hair actually brushed to the point it looked smooth. She was even wearing a few little black bows in it as she seemed to be working up her nerve to talk to Hubert, ever so slowly approaching him on her shaky legs.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth smiled, internally wishing Bernadetta luck, though she did feel a little concerned as Bernie seemed to falter, muttering to herself anxiously…Something another student seemed to notice, judging by how Emily huffed in visible annoyance before walking up to Hubert and shoving him toward Bernadetta.</p><p> </p><p>Hubert looked bewildered, then angered at the sudden shove, before he noticed Bernadetta hurry up to him, asking if he was okay. He responded in the affirmative, though he seemed a little distracted by the shorter Eagle’s change in clothing, and Byleth smiled in some satisfaction before she went up to Emily and gave her a little nudge.</p><p> </p><p>“Gh–Who the f–Oh. Uh, hey, professor,” Emily greeted, which was actually kind of remarkable.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Emily. Are you enjoying the dance?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Eh. It’s…different, I guess. Not really my thing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Have you asked someone to dance yet?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Maybe later.” She scratched her head, then gave Byleth a glance. “Do you want something?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth shook her head. “I just want my student to enjoy herself.”</p><p> </p><p>And it was true. Even if she had her concerns about Emily being an imposter, some Agarthan assassin or similar…she wanted her students to be happy. And Emily was her student.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m in a different class now, professor. You don’t have to worry about me. Besides, I…Well, whatever. I guess I might as well enjoy this while it lasts.”</p><p> </p><p>With that, she walked off, not as agitated as she once was. It was nice to see.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…you really are too naive,” Sothis noted, catching Byleth by some surprise since she didn’t expect her to speak up at the dance, “If you are correct and that girl really is an Agarthan, she almost certainly murdered the original Emily Korsch to assume her form. A girl died so she could pretend to be her. That fact does not disappear just because she is relaxing in the absence of conflict.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I know. But I want my students to be happy,” Byleth murmured back, earning a sigh from Sothis.</p><p> </p><p>“Too naive and too kind for your own good,” she complained, though there was a faint fondness in her words.</p><hr /><p>“Hey Claude! There you are!” Shez called out upon seeing her house leader in the fancy formal uniform, from where he was standing with the other two house leaders. All three of them were in those formal uniforms, though they were also wearing sashes in their house colors. Probably a house leader thing. “Oh hey Dimitri, hi Edelgard!”</p><p> </p><p>“Shez?” Dimitri exclaimed, looking caught off guard by her appearance, “You look…Well, ah, you look good. Very…radiant!”</p><p> </p><p>“You could just tell her she looks nice,” Edelgard commented, before nodding to Shez, “I see you put a lot of work into your appearance. Well done.”</p><p> </p><p>“...You look like Lorenz’s sister instead of Teach’s,” Claude stated, not at all hiding his amusement at her current state of dress, which earned a scandalized gasp from Dimitri.</p><p> </p><p>“I do? Well I guess we both have purple hair,” Shez considered, tilting her head in thought as she crossed her arms over her chest, before she paused. "Hey, no trying to distract me with an image of Lorenz in a dress, you know what you owe me." </p><p> </p><p>"...Okay, not what I was planning, but interesting that's where your mind went," Claude muttered, as he pulled out a bag of gold coins to hand over. </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, thank you for your payment~!" Shez said, making sure to announce that quite loudly as she took the bag. Then she looked down at her dress. "...hm, shit I forgot this doesn't have pockets." She frowned, then seemed to study her own chest. “Hm…maybe I could do like Manuela…nah, the bag’s too big, I would look like I have three boobs.”</p><p> </p><p>“...What?” Dimitri asked, his face reddening while Edelgard sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose.</p><p> </p><p>“Claude, why don’t you tend to your date?” she requested, internally wondering how she ever thought Shez could possibly be a spy. She knew the girl wasn’t completely unintelligent, but it was impossible not to regard her as at least somewhat stupid.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, trying to get rid of me already?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. Hopefully before Shez elects to shove her payment in her skirts.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Would it fit between the ruffles?” Shez asked, glancing at her gown with some curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright, come on before you flash everyone at the dance," Claude said, pulling her along, "We can talk later, your<em> majesty, </em>but for now, I might as well enjoy what my gold got me." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, right, see you guys!"</p><p> </p><p>"...I see Shez is the same as ever. I doubt she'll come by and talk with us later," Dimitri commented with a small frown as he watched the pair head onto the dancefloor, which earned a huff from Edelgard. </p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t that a good thing in our case? I noticed you wanted to say something while I explained what happened in Enbarr.” Edelgard turned, frowning up at the tall blond. “So go on, say what you wish to say.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Dimitri sighed, crossing his arms over his chest and frowning. “Are you really leaving the Officer’s Academy entirely?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I am. I have to. Duke Aegir’s overreach has shown that I cannot spend the rest of my year in leisure, even if I want to.”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri grimaced. “I would not call our year leisurely…”</p><p> </p><p>“It could have been worse,” she replied, well aware that it could have been far, far worse than it had.</p><p> </p><p>“It shouldn’t have been that bad to begin with! And that’s not even mentioning that the Church still hasn’t caught the last of those ‘cultists’, nor the Death Knight or the Flame Emperor!”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard frowned. “I know that, Dimitri, but that is the Church’s responsibility to deal with. My responsibility is to my people and my nation. I cannot let myself forget that responsibility, even if I would rather remain in these peaceful days at the Academy. And I do not need you to protect me.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I am not trying to–”</p><p> </p><p>“Then what was that spectacle yesterday?” she questioned with a deep frown, “You were accusing Professor Byleth of promiscuity.”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri stiffened, his face turning pink. “Ah, that…I admit, I may have overreacted–”</p><p> </p><p>“Why was it your place to react at all? You and I are nothing more than classmates, Dimitri. Even then, we are not in the same house. I do not see why you should have any investment in me beyond the simple courtesy we pay each other as students who attend the same academy.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Dimitri worked his jaw, trying to decide what he should say. He could feel the chance for answers start to slip away from him. He should have talked to her before. He should have let her know what connection they had. He should have checked to see if she truly didn’t remember their days together at all. Because he could see, quite clearly now, that she didn’t. </p><p> </p><p>He really was nothing more than a stranger to her.</p><p> </p><p>"...My apologies, but if I may, can I ask one question?" </p><p> </p><p>"I do hope you're not planning on asking me to dance after this." </p><p> </p><p>"No, I'd rather not make a fool of myself when dancing with someone as skilled as you," Dimitri said, a sad smile on his face. "I wanted to ask, that dagger you always have, its design seems to be of Faerghus, correct?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Yes, what about it?" </p><p> </p><p>"You know, in Faerghus blades are considered tools of destiny," Dimitri responded, "Something to be used to cut a better path forward to the future." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard frowned, unsure of what he was meaning by this yet also… feeling something distinctly familiar about it. </p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, that is quite the belief. Why do you bring it up?" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Dimitri took in a deep breath as he remembered Byleth’s words about not understanding one another without talking. "...I'm glad you have cut your own path, El." </p><p> </p><p>He could see the look of confusion cross her face, along with the moment it turned towards realization as the truth dawned on her. “...Dee? You were…Ha…You were the boy in Faerghus.”</p><p> </p><p>She laughed again, bewildered and disbelieving, but it was clear she understood. “…did you know? This whole time?”</p><p> </p><p>“I did. I…Well, we were both young then. I can imagine the memories would fade in time.” He smiled ruefully. “I did not expect you to forget me completely though.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I did not mean to. There were…extenuating circumstances.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I heard there was a plague in Adrestia. Perhaps…passed from Faerghus?”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard startled, her eyes widening before she shook her head. “Dimitri, no, it wasn’t–Goddess, that would be horrific…there was no plague, Dimitri. It wasn’t…Did you think it was your fault?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Maybe. Before you asked me just now, I doubt I would have realized it, but…I think there was some part of me that felt it had something to do with that. That perhaps you hated me for some fault of mine.” He shrugged. “It would hardly be the first friendship I ruined.”</p><p> </p><p>“It wasn’t your fault, Dimitri. There wasn’t a plague. The…My siblings were murdered, Dimitri. And…” She took a breath and couldn’t keep her shoulders from shaking with some emotion she couldn’t describe. She almost felt like laughing at the absurdity of the situation. “...I wish I had more time to explain. I…This whole time…" </p><p> </p><p>Her mind went back to the night when they had first met Byleth. About how she had tried to get Claude and Dimitri killed. </p><p> </p><p>"Edelgard? Are you okay?" Dimitri asked, breaking her out of her thoughts. </p><p> </p><p>"...My apologies, this is just… a lot to take in." </p><p> </p><p>"I understand, would you like me to get you some water?" he asked, concern evident in his voice. </p><p> </p><p>"No, I just… need to sit down for a moment." </p><p> </p><p>"Okay… Edelgard, I know you are leaving, but I hope we can speak again before you leave," Dimitri requested. </p><p> </p><p>"...Of course," Edelgard agreed, before walking away. She needed to clear her head. Get some air to try and think this through- </p><p> </p><p>"And where do you think you're going?" Catherine asked as she clapped a hand down on her shoulder. "You really shouldn't be trying to leave your own farewell party." </p><p> </p><p>"I-I'm not trying to. I'm just trying to get some fresh air." </p><p> </p><p>"Sure you're not, and I'm sure it has nothing to do with the professor leaving already," Catherine said with a raised eyebrow. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, she left?" Edelgard asked, her eyes looking around to see if Byleth had already gone to the Goddess Tower. </p><p> </p><p>"That she did, and while she can come and go, students really should stay at the ball," Catherine responded, smirking as she pulled Edelgard away from the door. "Come on, I'm sure there's plenty of people who want to dance with you." </p><p> </p><p>"There you are Edie!" Dorothea called out, getting their attention as she approached. "I was looking for you! I was starting to think you didn't want to dance with your date." </p><p> </p><p>"A-Ah, no, I just wanted to get some air." </p><p> </p><p>"You can get some air later! Come on, enjoy yourself," Catherine insisted, pushing Edelgard towards Dorothea, who smiled as she caught her. </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, come on Edie~." Dorothea grinned as she pulled her towards the dance floor. "Are you okay? You seem pale," Dorothea asked once they were in the middle of the dance floor, the music and everyone talking kept their conversation private as she spoke quietly. </p><p> </p><p>"...I just learned something very important," Edelgard said, unsure of what else to say. </p><p> </p><p>"Definitely seems like it," Dorothea replied, taking her hands as she began to lead the pair in a dance. "That's the second time I've seen you looking so pale. Though, no need to talk about it if you don't want to." </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you…" Edelgard murmured, before she looked around, watching the various students dancing and talking. It seems Yuri had been amused enough by Sylvain striking out so much that now he was leading him on the dance floor, while off in the distance she could see Cyril talking with Shamir, likely catching up with his mentor. Shez and Claude were certainly making quite the scene as they danced, neither of them that skilled but certainly eager. Behind her, Edelgard could hear Catherine giving Lysithea advice of some sort, one which Lysithea vehemently denied needing. </p><p> </p><p>"Coin for your thoughts?" Dorothea asked. </p><p> </p><p>"...I am simply realizing how much I'll miss this place," Edelgard answered. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, it's not like you won't be coming back, I mean, we did promise to have a class reunion here, and I'm sure despite how busy you'll be, you'll be able to find some time away from being the emperor." </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe, I suppose we'll have to see," Edelgard said. </p><p> </p><p>"Yup, and if you're feeling lonely, well the Mittlefrank Opera House is near the palace~." </p><p> </p><p>"...That does sound nice," Edelgard admitted, "It has been quite some time since I've been to the opera, but it has provided some comfort in the past." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I actually did see one of your performances before. It helped bring some… normalcy back to my life." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I'm glad I could help then! And the emperor is always welcome to visit~," Dorothea teased, getting Edelgard to blush.</p><p> </p><p>"H-Hm, right…" </p><p> </p><p>"Though I must say, it's a bit of a surprise to see that the professor left so early. I wonder if my letter had anything to do with it…" </p><p> </p><p>"Letter?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I left one for her like I left for you. Did you not read it?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…" Edelgard frowned. "If you left an unmarked letter, Hubert likely threw it away while I was out." </p><p> </p><p>"...Goddess damn it, Hubie," Dorothea muttered, "Well, either way, we should make sure to get out as soon as we can so she's not alone out there for too long." </p><p> </p><p>"...Yes, that would be for the best," Edelgard muttered, before glancing up at Dorothea. "If I may ask, are you…actually being genuine when you talked about…you, the professor, and I?" </p><p> </p><p>"Why wouldn't I be~?" </p><p> </p><p>"Because…It's something I cannot fully understand myself. I can understand if you were attempting to do so if you did not want me to ignore my own feelings but there is no need to do this. I understand that it…might be tradition for emperors to do something like that, but you don't need to-"</p><p> </p><p>"Edelgard," That caught the emperor off guard as she heard her friend call her by her name. "I'm doing this because I want to. You like the professor and me, I like you and the professor, and… well, Professor Byleth might have her difficulties with her emotions, but I'm sure she likes the two of us as well. And honestly…the tradition is just an excuse really. Even if we don't get married, isn't it enough for all of us to be with the ones we care about?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Even if it means a life of hardship?" </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, you know, Lorenz said something similar, about how a life of nobility is something most commoners aren't going to be ready for. I guess the life of royalty is even harder than that." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Edelgard moved her hand to hold onto Dorothea’s. "...There's something important I was planning on telling the professor. I think I want you to hear it as well." </p><p> </p><p>"Well I’d love to hear it, so we better sneak out when we can~" </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me, my apologies for interrupting the festivities, but there is something to announce!" Seteth spoke up, catching everyone's attention. </p><p> </p><p>"I suppose I should get ready," Edelgard said, about to pull back, before feeling Dorothea gently squeeze her hand. </p><p> </p><p>"Make sure to take care of yourself, okay Edie?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Of course, thank you for everything, Dorothea." Edelgard smiled at her, before she bowed to the songstress. Turning around, Edelgard approached Seteth, and stood nearby as he continued talking. </p><p> </p><p>"Now, I understand much has happened this year. However, this is of great importance." He glanced over at Edelgard, before nodding to her. Taking center stage, she looked out over everyone. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you for your attention," Edelgard began, taking in the sight of all the students she had spent so long with. Familiar faces, all looking up at her. "Recently, I temporarily left the academy to travel to Enbarr." <em> Wait. </em> "A matter of grave importance demanded my attention." <em> Where is Emily? </em> "As such, I would like to formally announce that I, Edelgard von Hresvelg am now the Emperor-" </p><p> </p><p>A loud explosion, one strong enough to shake the glass of the building they were in sounded out. Immediately, panicked screams were heard throughout the building, wondering what was going on. Dimly aware of Seteth trying to calm down the students, Edelgard rushed out of the building. </p><p> </p><p>Once she was out under the night sky, Edelgard felt her heart drop. Up, far above her in the air, the goddess tower was ablaze, crumbling from the hole the fire surrounded. For a moment, it was as if all sound had cut out, as she could only stare in horror at the sight. As she saw something fall from the tower, she couldn't help but scream. </p><p> </p><p>“PROFES-”</p><hr /><p>Letting out a small yawn, Edelgard sat up, her mind slightly bleary before she managed to shake the daze of sleep out of her head. She had a very important day to prepare for, after all. One that she couldn’t mess up. Depending on how things go, this could be her last peaceful day with everyone-</p><p> </p><p>An incessant knocking at her door caught her attention, “Edelgard, can you open up?”</p><p> </p><p>“Professor? What’s wrong?” Edelgard asked, worried about the slightly hurried tone in Byleth’s voice. Frowning, she quickly put on a robe to answer the door, only to stiffen as Byleth quickly pushed her way in and locked the door behind her. “P-Professor?”</p><p> </p><p>“We need to talk. I know who the infiltrators are,” Byleth said, looking far too exhausted for someone who she was sure went to sleep early last night. “And…I know your secret.”</p>

  <p>"Must you leave so early?" Sothis complained, frowning while she floated by Byleth. "The night is still young, there is more dancing to be had!" </p><p> </p><p>“I can dance later,” Byleth replied as she walked along the route to the Goddess Tower, “For now, I need to meet Edelgard and Dorothea.”</p><p> </p><p>“Bah, are they even going to be up there yet? The last I saw, that house leader was still talking with that Dimitri boy and the songstress was helping others dance.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’ll be there,” Byleth affirmed, “They might not be there yet, but I can wait for them.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. Fine, but I’m going to start annoying you if she doesn’t arrive quickly enough.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth could have replied “like you’re doing right now?” but she was more mature than that, so she let it slide in favor of heading up the Goddess Tower. She recalled the legend of the tower as she walked, and a part of her wondered if it would work if there were three people up there…hm well neither of the two she was meeting were that religious, so would they even believe in this legend? There had to be a reason why they both wanted to be up here with her. </p><p> </p><p>…Were they going to elope?</p><p> </p><p>No wait, that didn't make sense. If they were going to do that, Edelgard wouldn't have made such a big deal of becoming the Emperor. The thought also made her feel weird, so she was just going to ignore it. </p><p> </p><p>Either way, it wasn’t long before she was inside the empty stone room at the top. It did have a nice view of the monastery from up there, she had to admit. The night sky looked beautiful…</p><p> </p><p>The brief feeling of growing heat at the back of her neck was the only warning Byleth got before she ducked, drawing her sword and whirling around as a fireball went sailing over her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Tch. I wonder, was that your power, Fell Star, or do you truly have that good of instincts?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked, a frown coming to her face as she studied the blonde woman in front of her, who looked like an average priestess of the monastery. “...Fell Star?”</p><p> </p><p>“You, abomination. That is the name of the false god that descended from the heavens and stole the land from its rightful rulers,” the woman explained with a small smirk, her tone calm and even, “I presume you know none of that truth then? You are a vessel, after all. Merely the echo of the False God.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth narrowed her eyes. “You’re one of those people then. The Agarthans.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, excellent! You’re not a complete idiot!” The woman giggled, before placing a hand on her chest and bowing with a flourish. “Hello, Professor Byleth Eisner, daughter of Jeralt the Blade Breaker. For the past, oh, however many months, I have been known as Selene, a priestess of the Church of Seiros. My true name though…”</p><p> </p><p>She giggled again, then straightened as darkness and flames erupted from her body. The guise of the priestess she wore burned away until Byleth was faced with a woman with pale white skin and pitch-black hair. Her robes transformed, twisting from white fabric into a black and scarlet shoulderless gown decorated with rubies, chains, and feathers. Her black-painted lips curled into a smile as her crimson eyes glittered with delighted malice. “Is Bias, Seeker of Vengeance.”</p><p> </p><p>“...You want revenge against me then.” Byleth nodded while she considered the distance between herself and the mage. She could maybe strike her with the sword of the creator, there wasn’t that much space between them… “For Pittacus?" </p><p> </p><p>"Aha, so you do know what I want," Bias said, no amusement in her words despite her smile. </p><p> </p><p>"I heard from Shez that you want revenge for her. Though I don't know what that has to do with me." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course you don't. I would be surprised if you did, I mean, you didn't even know Thales was there, so how could you have known my sister was in the carriage with him! Hahahaha!" She began to laugh, unnerving Byleth. She sounded genuinely unhinged–And then the laughter cut off entirely. "But then that doesn’t really matter, no, not really. Because you still killed her, and I’ve been putting this off for so very long, trying to make sure I had everything lined up to make this work…It’s been maddening, you know? Knowing you were here with your happy little family. Your papa, and your sister." </p><p> </p><p>She laughed again, bitter and angry. “It seems some people really are favored over others, hm? Though you’re not really a person, are you? Just an empty shell with a god contained inside. I wonder, is the intelligence you have even your own, or are you just an amnesiac deity aping the actions of a human? You are heartless, after all, so the topic warrants speculation. Really, the scientist in me would love to see what the reality of ‘Byleth Eisner’ is, but I absolutely hate you and want you dead, so that curiosity can be damned for all I care.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth took a breath, keeping her sword at the ready. She knew this woman’s motivations and that she was a threat to not only her, but likely her entire family. She wasn’t about to allow that. Even if her grip wavered as she stared at the mage, stricken with grief over her sister's death. </p><p> </p><p>“...a god…?” Sothis murmured, meanwhile, her brow furrowed in thought and concern. “I…could it be…?”</p><p> </p><p>“Is that all you had to say?” Byleth asked, steady and ready to fight.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, no, thank you for reminding me.” Bias snapped her fingers with a grin and Byleth felt herself stiffen as she saw Emily appear in front of her, her arms bound tight and a gag in her mouth. “You know, I really should thank that Archbishop of yours. Or perhaps her chamberlain? Whichever one made all those faith magic books so readily available in their library. Ah, speaking of–”</p><p> </p><p>She clenched her fist and there was a flash of red magic as Byleth felt a strange, tight sensation settle over her. The professor frowned deeper, then glanced at her hand as she tried to form a fireball. Nothing happened. She couldn’t call on her magic.</p><p> </p><p>“And I believe that leaves one more thing,” Bias said, smirking once more as she placed a hand on Emily’s shoulder, earning a flinch from the restrained girl, whose eyes flicked towards the mad mage in obvious fear. A warranted fear, given Bias moved her other hand towards Emily’s face and set her palm alight with magical fire. “Toss your sword off the tower, or your student dies.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Let Emily go afterward,” Byleth demanded.</p><p> </p><p>“WHAT!?” Sothis screeched, snapped from her consideration as she stared at Byleth in shock. “You cannot be serious! That is your only weapon! You cannot just throw it away, and especially not for her! You know that girl is an imposter!”</p><p> </p><p>“Throw the sword away first then,” Bias responded, her tone mocking, “If you care at all for this girl, it shouldn’t even be a choice–”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t. Byleth tossed the Sword of the Creator out of the tower.</p><p> </p><p>“...” The flames on Bias’s hand winked out as she laughed aloud, eyes wide with disbelief. “Hahaha! Are you serious?! You didn’t even hesitate! And for this trash!? Oh, or did you? Did you, perhaps, test things, hm? Maybe you struck out and saw that it wouldn’t work, so you turned back time to pretend you wouldn’t sacrifice your student’s life for your own sake?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth showed no reaction to the knowledge that Bias knew about her powers. She just held out her now empty hand. “I upheld my end of the bargain. Let my student go.”</p><p> </p><p>“...You didn’t?” Bias blinked, her confusion obvious, before she scowled and shoved Emily forward. “Fine, take the trash. I’ll give you a moment to console her as a favor to your ‘kindness’ before I boil your brain inside your skull.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth caught her student and, despite the situation, she smiled at Emily. “It’s okay. I’ve got you–”</p><p> </p><p>The sound of a knife piercing into flesh echoed through the tower. The barely tied ropes fell away from Emily’s body as she glared up at her wide-eyed professor. “...Just fall down and die.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth just stared for a moment at her student, and at the blood dripping down from the black dagger in her hand, before she fell back to the ground with a faint thud, blood staining the front of her uniform.</p><p> </p><p>“There, I did it,” Emily said, turning back toward Bias with a scowl, one hand clenched tight around the dagger in it.</p><p> </p><p>“So you did! Hm, not quite as satisfying as I thought it would be.” Bias sighed. “I guess it just goes to show what they say about vengeance…ah, I don’t remember what they say about vengeance, it’s probably something pithy about it being bad. Ah well.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Do I get to go now?” Emily asked, “I don’t…I just want to go home, Bias.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Home? Now where would that be again?”</p><p> </p><p>“Would you stop screwing around? You said we could just warp out of here once I killed her, and I did. She’s dead, let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a legitimate question, Kronya! After all, you’re the one cozying up to the beasts. Trying to find a new home for yourself, hm? It’s understandable, given no one wants you or would even care if you died. Really, our people would probably celebrate, given how <em> you </em> murdered Solon.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Kronya swallowed, trying to ignore the pit of despair growing in her belly at the sage’s outright gleeful lie. “You promised.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, you sound like a child when you whine like that. But then again, you were always a brat. At least you turned out to be useful at the end.” She grinned, raising a hand as fiery orange sigils began to light up all around the interior of the tower. “Now be a good little scapegoat and accept your sacrifice with dignity.”</p><p> </p><p>Kronya flinched back, instinctively trying to get away as she looked for a route out–And then she felt a pair of strong arms wrap around her as Byleth put herself between Kronya and the explosion, the force of the blast sending them both right over the edge of the tower as the entire top erupted in a massive fireball.</p><p> </p><p>Kronya’s eyes were wide with disbelief as she fell, the sheer impossibility of the situation keeping her from reacting for a second before her mind started working rapidly, trying to think of how she could survive the fall. Her guise burned away, her identity of Emily Korsch vanishing as she returned to her true flesh for the first time in almost a year. </p><p> </p><p>She had no time to enjoy the sensation though as her tails shot out, stabbing into the stone of the tower as she tried her damnedest to slow their descent. It was difficult, near impossible, and she could feel a pain in her spine at the sensation, but she held firm until they finally slowed to a stop on the ground.</p><p> </p><p>“H-Haahhh…th-that bitch,” Kronya growled, tense and pained from the brutal descent, though her superior’s treachery stung almost as badly. She knew Bias had lost it, that she was a vicious bitch that couldn’t be trusted…but it still hurt.</p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, then looked at the woman who tried to save her, who had burns all across her back and was breathing heavily in her grasp. “...why did you do that?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth tried to steady her breath, her back still stinging from the explosion, before giving the girl who wasn’t Emily as good of a smile as she could manage. “You’re my student, Emily. I protect my students.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Kronya swallowed. An Agarthan couldn’t cry, they had no need for tears. But the cold, black heart in her chest tightened painfully at her professor’s declaration. “...It's Kronya…" </p><p> </p><p>Reaching into her pocket, Byleth pulled out a red handkerchief, before grabbing Kronya's hand. With a gentle pull, she managed to get the Agarthan to open her tightly clenched fist, revealing the wound on her hand where Kronya had stabbed herself instead of stabbing Byleth, which she bandaged up with the handkerchief. </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry…my magic is still sealed…" Byleth apologized, her breathing getting heavier. </p><p> </p><p>"...You need to… get out of here," she continued, hearing more explosions erupting around the monastery as screams and roars rang out. "They're not…going to let you go…" </p><p> </p><p>“I know I won’t,” a cold voice said, before a spear of fire pierced through Kronya, making her scream in pain as she was consumed in flames–</p><hr /><p>“I upheld my end of the bargain. Let my student go,” Byleth repeated, trying to match the same cadence she spoke in earlier.</p><p> </p><p>“...You didn’t?” Bias blinked, her confusion obvious, before she scowled and shoved Emily forward. “Fine, take the trash. I’ll give you a moment to console her as a favor to your ‘kindness’ before I boil your brain inside your skull.”</p><p> </p><p>Bracing herself, Byleth caught the disguised Agarthan. “Don’t worry, I have this handled,” she said, before grabbing her hand before Kronya could stab her, moving to twist the knife out of her grip and toss it–</p><p> </p><p>A blaze of fire cut her off. Bias did not hesitate for a moment when she saw Byleth making a move. This time, when the tower erupted in fire, they didn’t have a chance to get out, and Bias gladly burned with them.</p><hr /><p>Byleth ducked beneath the fireball that went over her head and swung out without hesitation, sending the Sword of the Creator straight at Bias and catching her–</p><hr /><p>Byleth stumbled at the bottom of the Goddess Tower, letting out a breath as she felt the phantom sensation of her own body burning. This Bias woman certainly didn't hesitate…taking in a small breath, she tried to figure out what to do. She still had two more charges, but she would rather not cut it close. Okay, Bias was planning on ambushing her on the tower, so she just had to make sure to face her somewhere else. Maybe she should find some back up? There were people on patrol so she could find help easily enough. </p><p> </p><p>Looking around, she tried to make it seem as if she remembered something, before walking away from the tower. </p><p> </p><p>“They’re behind us. That Bias woman can barely hide the scowl on her face,” Sothis said, staring behind Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>“Well that’s a start. I just need to find a good enough place to confront them,” Byleth murmured, getting on the bridge only for her eyes to widen as she ducked, barely dodging a fireball. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t think you’ll be getting to safety that easily, Fell Star,” Bias called out, one arm outstretched while another wrapped around Emi–Kronya’s neck, holding her hostage. </p><p> </p><p>“...What do you want?” Byleth asked, playing along for now. </p><p> </p><p>“You dead and that sword gone,” Bias stated, not doing away with her disguise this time. “And if you don't, your precious student is going to pay the price. But you already knew that, didn’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>“...How did you figure out how the divine pulse works?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would I ever tell you? You can talk to me all you want, but it doesn’t matter, does it? Nothing matters until you’re dead. What does reality matter when some abomination can just alter it at her own will, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth grimaced. “That’s not how it works.” </p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t it? If the world doesn’t turn in the right way, you turn it back. That kind of power really is monstrous. Though, with it, I have to ask…why would you keep trying to save Kronya here?” she wondered, glancing at the younger Agarthan, “You should know she’s not one of you…and you should know that she, like all of our people, will strike you down the instant she gets the opportunity…” Her eyes drifted back up towards Byleth, a strange intensity growing in them. “Unless she didn’t. Unless this little bitch really is a traitor.”</p><p> </p><p>Her hand lit aflame as her grip around Kronya’s throat tightened. “Gh–I-I-I wouldn’t! B-Bias, I’m–grk–I-I’m loyal–”</p><p> </p><p>“Let her go,” Byleth ordered, her grip tightening on the Sword of the Creator.</p><p> </p><p>“...No. I won’t.” Bias, wearing the face of the priestess Selene, smiled. It was a wide, unpleasant smile that showed her teeth. “You underestimate my resolve, Fell Star. I would gladly burn myself if it saw you dead in the attempt. Of course I would kill this degenerate failure if it meant ending you. In fact…I want to know something. Do you have a limit to your power?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Why would you ask that? You won’t remember if I do turn things back.”</p><p> </p><p>“Personal satisfaction…including the fact that it means, if I’m right…then this is guaranteed to make you waste a chance.” And in a sudden burst of flames, both Bias and Kronya were engulfed in a massive conflagration, the mad sage laughing loud while Byleth’s student screamed in pain–</p><p> </p><p>The world went still, distorted, and Byleth couldn’t grit her teeth or clench her fists in the paused time she dwelled in before she could turn things backwards. Then she could, because she suddenly found herself in the Sothis’s throne room.</p><p> </p><p>“Well this is aggravating,” Sothis complained with a frown, lounging on her throne with an aggravated frown, “To think, one of those foul sorcerers could figure out our powers, much less plan around them…though I suppose her willingness to destroy herself is certainly a contributing factor.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Turning back to right before I go up isn’t working,” Byleth muttered, “I need to go further back, maybe see if I can get someone to help me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…she was waiting for you in the goddess tower. Perhaps if you were to bring someone with you? Or have someone sneak up on her while you confront her?”</p><p> </p><p>“...How did she get a hold of Kronya?” Byleth wondered, frowning, “If I knew when she took her hostage…she was at the ball, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, she likely grabbed her there. If Kronya didn’t go to her, that is. Bias might be planning to betray her, but Kronya is unaware of that. Much like how she isn’t aware of your ability to turn back time, it seems.” </p><p> </p><p>”So, we should go talk-” </p><p> </p><p>“No, there is no telling how she might react if you tell her that you’re aware of that plan, especially in a crowded location like the ball.” </p><p> </p><p>“...Right.” She knew Kronya was willing to let her live, but there was no saying how she might react if she was surprised like that. “...I should talk with Edelgard. She knows that Emily is likely the infiltrator, and if I dont go up to the tower, she and Dorothea might get caught in the trap instead.” </p><p> </p><p>“I see…hm. Well, I will say that Edelgard plainly favors you, so I believe you have a good chance of convincing her to aid you. The question is, when should you ask her for aid?”</p><p> </p><p>“When? I…at the ball, right? I know where Kronya and Bias…<em> should </em> be, I think. If Edelgard could help me…Edelgard wanted to meet me to begin with. She’s who I need to talk to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you certain of that? What of the knights? Or your father? Or perhaps Shez?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused. “I…damn it, I should have tried–”</p><p> </p><p>“No, do not start thinking of what you <em> should have </em> done, think about what you <em> will do </em>. What happens if you inform the Knights of Seiros instead?”</p><p> </p><p>“...They try to go after Bias, she probably kills them and blows up the tower, then comes after me and my family–She would try to kill Jeralt and Shez too. No, she hates me, she would go for them first if I tried to bring them along...You heard her earlier. She probably resents that I still have my sister and father…even though she killed her own father-figure…” Byleth felt her frown deepen. "And if I tell Shez…I don't know how she'd react to Emily being an infiltrator. She might get reckless and Bias could easily take advantage of that." </p><p> </p><p>"So your best bet is Edelgard. Do you think talking with her at the ball or before the ball would be best?" </p><p> </p><p>"...before. If I try during the ball we might not be able to sneak out easily," Byleth decided, doing her best to think things through, "It gives us some more time to plan too." </p><p> </p><p>"Very well then, you have a plan of attack. Go forth, and save your precious student," Sothis said, a smile on her face. </p><hr /><p>Taking a deep breath as she stood in front of her mirror, Byleth didn’t change into the formal uniform this time and stuck to her usual outfit instead. Once she was ready, she left her room and made a beeline towards Edelgard’s. Once there, she carefully knocked on the door, trying to look as natural as possible in case Bias was watching her.</p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Who is it?" </p><p> </p><p>"Edelgard, it's me. I had something I wanted to talk to you about. It might seem silly, but it's about the last test you had." </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me?" A moment later the door opened and Edelgard stood there in a fancy, lordly outfit. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you mind if I could come in?" Byleth asked, stepping in once Edelgard moved to the right. And she immediately let out a breath once the door closed behind them. "Emily is the infiltrator, I confirmed it." </p><p> </p><p>“Wh–Ah…you did?”</p><p> </p><p>“I did. Her name is Kronya, but more importantly, she’s working with a second…” Byleth trailed off. Of course she did. Because Edelgard couldn’t hide her reaction. There wasn’t the surprised confusion or bemusement that might come with hearing something unexpected. She recognized Kronya’s name, and there wasn’t a hint of surprise when she heard the word ‘second’. “...You knew." </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me?" Edelgard asked, trying to school her features. </p><p> </p><p>"You knew Kronya was pretending to be Emily, and that Bias was the second," Byleth stated, noting the panic in Edelgard’s eyes. Almost instinctively, Byleth’s hand moved to her sword. "...are you one too?" </p><p> </p><p>“N-No! No, professor, please, I was never–” Edelgard stopped herself. She’d reached towards Byleth, trying to convince her, but she pulled her hand back and took a breath, closing her eyes for a moment. When she opened them again, there was a cold determination in her gaze. “Professor. I am not an Agarthan. Everything I have told you about my hatred for them was true. I never lied about that. I did, however, keep quiet when it came to other matters of importance. Such as the fact that, though I despise Those Who Slither in the Dark, I believed I could use them for my true goals of changing Fodlan.</p><p> </p><p>“To that end…I became the Flame Emperor.”</p><p> </p><p>"You…" Byleth felt dizzy. She had experienced dying today and somehow this was making her chest tense up more. </p><p> </p><p>"I wasn't working with them at first. The bandits that chased after us at the start of the year, and the incidents with Lord Lonato and the Mausoleum occurred because of me, but I had no hand in Flayn's kidnapping, or what they are attempting in Ordelia at the moment," Edelgard stated, attempting to keep her steel. "I also have reason to believe they had a hand in the Almyran invasion that happened recently." </p><p> </p><p>"I…" Byleth shook her head, trying to focus. "...you said Flayn’s kidnapping." </p><p> </p><p>"...I attempted to toss Bias off the trail, but…I believe I was the one who made her interested in Shez in the first place." </p><p> </p><p>"Have…This entire time I trusted you, and you were working with them. You kept telling me to leave Kronya alone, is this why? Were you mocking me behind my back?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, of course not! Professor you need to believe–"</p><p> </p><p>"Shez died," Byleth said, her mind honing in on her sister's death at Lonato's hand. </p><p> </p><p>"What?" Edelgard’s eyes widened, shock evident in her eyes. "Professor, what are you–"</p><p> </p><p>"Did you know about the divine pulse too? How much did Bias tell you?" Byleth demanded to know, her mind swirling with memories. Her chest clenched as she tried to focus, unable to hear Edelgard– </p><p> </p><p>She felt a hand touch her shoulder, and she couldn't stop her reaction. Grabbing her wrist, Byleth pinned Edelgard against the bed, placing her dagger against the princess' throat. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth felt tense, as neither of them made a sound. </p><p> </p><p>The heavy silence was only broken as Edelgard let out a small breath and closed her eyes. A small bead of blood swelled up from where the mercenary's dagger was placed. The memory of Edelgard and Kronya being cut down by the Death Knight flashed in her mind, and Byleth couldn't help her panic as she reared back, tossing her dagger into the floor. </p><p> </p><p>"...How much of it was real. Are…are we actually friends?" Byleth asked, feeling tears stinging her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>"I mean what I'm about to say. You are one of my most cherished friends, Byleth," Edelgard said, staring up at her professor. "I had intended on confessing to you at the goddess tower, yet it seems things have fallen out of my control."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah…" Byleth looked down at Edelgard, and felt her chest tense as she saw the trail of blood on her neck. Reaching down, she healed the princess. "S-Sorry." </p><p> </p><p>"It's okay. I was prepared for worse," Edelgard stated as Byleth moved off her. "...What did you mean Shez died? I just saw her getting dragged off to get ready for the ball." </p><p> </p><p>"..." She only had one charge left, she couldn't just rewind again. She had to take the risk. "...I have the ability to turn back time." </p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard took a slow breath, before frowning at Byleth. “My teacher…I understand you would not joke in this situation, but a part of me cannot help but feel that you are trying to ‘one-up’ my secret, as it were.”</p><p> </p><p>“...pff-” Byleth snorted, unable to hide a giggle. “That–I swear, I’m not. I’m not Shez. Or Ferdinand.”</p><p> </p><p>“He would absolutely…You can turn back time.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth nodded, getting serious again. “Yes, I can. I only really use it to avert disasters, and I have a limited amount of times I can use it in a day.”</p><p> </p><p>"Disasters like…Shez dying?" Edelgard asked, before frowning as she remembered their first mission together. "Or…Ferdinand?"</p><p> </p><p>"And others. I didn't need to with the invasion with how much you've all improved but…yes. The first time I had to use it was back when we first met, actually. I wasn't able to fully deflect that bandit's attack." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Edelgard let out a small breath, aware that if Byleth was telling the truth, then there was an alternate world where her choice to hire bandits led to her death. That was…darkly ironic. “So, what disaster prompted you to come back here? I can’t imagine you would come to me like this unless something terrible happened.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth frowned. “Why wouldn’t I come to you? I appreciate your help and your perspective.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I meant it more in the sense…thank you for that.” She tried to ignore her face starting to redden. “I think you would normally be more circumspect and less harried if you had simply discovered the truth about Kronya and Bias, so clearly something went wrong. Add in the ability you just told me about, and I can’t imagine things went well tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“They were going well. Then…” Byleth sighed, then began to explain the events of the night.</p><p> </p><p>"...I see, I must admit it is troubling to know that Bias knows about your ability as well, and that she's willing to kill herself and her hostage. Though I am just as surprised to hear that Kronya was trying to save you."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah…I guess she does care about us." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Edelgard bit down the instinct to say that it was a trick. "So…what is your plan?"</p><p> </p><p>"...We need to keep track of Bias and Kronya. Heading to the goddess tower is a bad idea as well, we should try to lead them elsewhere," Byleth said, trying to keep a clear head, "Bias is extremely skilled with fire magic and won't hesitate to kill herself if it means succeeding in her goals." </p><p> </p><p>"So we need to make sure to catch her off guard…" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah…hm. Hey, does Dorothea know about you?" </p><p> </p><p>"No? Why do you ask?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, well, you wanted to meet me up at the goddess tower and I got a letter from Dorothea saying she wanted to meet up there with you as well. So I thought maybe you had told her, with how close you two are." </p><p> </p><p>"...I was unaware that she wanted to meet us both up there," Edelgard said, idly wondering if Hubert had entered her room and tossed out an unmarked letter. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…hm, so I guess you two aren't planning to elope," Byleth muttered, getting Edelgard to pause for a moment as she tried to register those words. </p><p> </p><p>“I…professor, no. I would not leave the monastery and abdicate my position just to elope.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I didn’t expect you to abdicate. I think it still counts as eloping if you leave the monastery to marry her in Adrestia,” Byleth pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“...I still have no intention of doing that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Hm. Are you sure?”</p><p> </p><p>“Professor, is this really a priority right now?”</p><p> </p><p>"I just want to make sure everything is okay with you two" Byleth said with a small frown on her face. "I mean, you two won't be seeing each other for some time. And if nothing else, it's important that you two are happy." </p><p> </p><p>“Hm…well, I appreciate your concern, but we really should focus on what to do next, professor. If Bias is planning to make a move tonight, then we need to work to prevent it ahead of time.”</p><p> </p><p>"That's true…well, the main thing to keep in mind is that she knows about the divine pulse. So we need to act as if nothing is out of the ordinary. If she gets any inkling that I turned back time then she'll strike," Byleth considered, trying to come up with a plan, "So we need to go about our day, which means getting ready for the ball. We also need to keep an eye on Kronya, since she's the important part to this. As long as we can keep her separate from Bias, then I can take Bias out easily. Hm…I could probably also wait a bit before heading to the tower so soon after the ball starts." </p><p> </p><p>"...Professor, exactly how early did you go to the tower?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…hm, about an hour after the ball started?" </p><p> </p><p>"Why did you go so early?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well you said you had something important to talk about, so I wanted to make sure I was ready." </p><p> </p><p>"That…professor I meant later in the night. You know, slipping away while the festivities were at a high point." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…ah, well I guess I don't need to go that early then," Byleth allowed, looking mildly embarrassed. "Though I guess I already know what you wanted to talk about….hm, what do you think Dorothea wanted to talk about?" </p><p> </p><p>“...What indeed,” Edelgard murmured, her face warming a little as she considered what the songstress may have been intending. Presumably, she knew the legends about the tower too, so if she wanted both of them there… “Well, we can ask her later, when things are settled.”</p><p> </p><p>"Hm, well hopefully it's not as big of a reveal as what you told me." </p><p> </p><p>"...do you wish to talk about me being the Flame Emperor?" </p><p> </p><p>"We can talk afterwards. I…I want to know what you're planning, but regardless of what happens you'll be important to me, okay Edelgard?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Of course, my teacher." </p><p> </p><p>"Now then, I should probably head back before anyone notices I've been in here for a while. I don't want any weird rumors to start about you cheating on Dorothea or anything," Byleth said, standing up as she got ready to leave. </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard didn't know how to respond to that so she chose not to. Instead, she just let out a sigh.</p><hr /><p>Things were going okay. The ball was still as lovely as the first time around and this time Byleth was able to stick around long enough to dance. It was admittedly a bit rough for her since she was still new to dancing, but when Flayn pulled her onto the dance floor, she was clearly looking for more fun instead of a perfect dancer. </p><p> </p><p>After that, it was one person after the other who wanted to dance with her, with the only break happening when Edelgard announced she would be leaving to be the emperor. Even Catherine wanted a turn, though said turn ended up being very short since Shez cut in, the mercenary spinning her sister around with surprising ease given the dress she was in. </p><p> </p><p>"You know, it's a shame you didn't get dressed up too," her sister said, grinning cheerfully in all her finery. </p><p> </p><p>"I suppose, though, who knows? Maybe next time we have a gala, I'll be in a similar dress," Byleth remarked, still amused by her sister's outfit. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh I'm sure everyone would have fun dressing you up. Though…hm, I doubt I can get Claude to pay for you. Maybe you can get Edelgard to pay for your dress and makeup?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'll ask." With a light chuckle, Byleth continued to dance with Shez, up until someone tapped Shez’s shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>"Mind if we cut in?" Dorothea asked with Edelgard standing by her side. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Oh, sure!” And Shez casually handed Byleth off to Dorothea with a cheeky grin. “Good luck you two! May the best dance partner win~”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked. “Shez, it’s not a competition–”</p><p> </p><p>But her sister had already headed off to find the next person to dance with, leaving her with Edelgard and Dorothea, who grinned. "Heh, I'll try not to show off too much then~." </p><p> </p><p>"This really isn't a competition," Edelgard muttered, before pausing as Dorothea grabbed her and Byleth’s hand so the three could dance together. </p><p> </p><p>"Aw come on Edie, what's a bit of friendly competition?" Dorothea asked, a smile on her face. "Besides, I'm sure the professor here is enjoying being able to dance with her favorite students, isn't that right?" </p><p> </p><p>"A professor shouldn't play favorites," Byleth said, getting Dorothea to pout. "...Though it is nice being with you two." </p><p> </p><p>“It most certainly is~”</p><p> </p><p>“H-Hm…ah, Dorothea, could I speak with the professor for a moment?” Edelgard requested, earning a big grin from the songstress.</p><p> </p><p>“Ooo~? Looking for a little private conversation, are we~? Well I suppose I can leave you two be for a moment, though I expect to hear about any big decisions, alright?”</p><p> </p><p>“Y-Yes, of course, I will make sure to inform you.”</p><p> </p><p>That brought a smile to Dorothea’s face before she let go of the pair and moved over to join the rest of her friends, leaving Edelgard and Byleth to have a moment to themselves.</p><p> </p><p>"Kronya is still in the gala. I've been having Hubert keep an eye on her, and it seems that she is likely waiting for you to leave before she goes to Bias," Edelgard said in a low voice as the two danced together. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, that’s good…did anything else happen?</p><p> </p><p>"Ah…well, I had an interesting conversation with Dimitri,” she murmured, before shaking her head, “More importantly, are you sure we shouldn't try to go after Bias yet? Or maybe try something else?" </p><p> </p><p>"No. I already know Bias trapped the tower with magic, somehow, and if she gets any indication that I know what she's planning, then she'll lash out. Our best bet is to attempt to leave soon and head to the courtyard. It's a wide open place and we can find cover easily should she attack us," Byleth decided, moving in sync with the emperor. </p><p> </p><p>"I see…well, in that case, we need to figure out a way for Dorothea to stay behind. I'd rather not drag her into this." </p><p> </p><p>"...yeah, if it's just the two of us, I have a better chance of making sure we make it out okay," Byleth responded, before glancing at the songstress who was smiling at the two. "We could ask her to wait here. I'm sure she'll be understanding." </p><p> </p><p>"Perhaps…though I will say, I must admit it is a shame we likely won't be able to climb the Goddess Tower tonight. It's an important place to my parents, and I was hoping to gain something similar by going there." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? What happened there?" </p><p> </p><p>"It's where my father met my mother. From what he said, it was love at first sight," Edelgard said, a small blush on her face, "Perhaps if we have the time, we can meet there before I have to leave." </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe? That sounds like it would be nice,” Byleth replied, smiling, before a thought occurred. <em> Oh, I wonder if Dorothea knows about that? Hm…Manuela said the whole legend about the tower referred to a man and a woman, but maybe Dorothea was going to try confessing there anyway? Heh, that would cute– </em></p><p> </p><p>And in an instant, Byleth’s smile dropped, because she spotted a very familiar priestess walk into the room. In a second, it occurred to her that she didn’t actually have a guarantee that Bias would have stayed in one location just because that was what she did previously. Not when things had already changed…She should have made her move before the ball, she shouldn’t–</p><p> </p><p>In the next second, Bias spotted her. And the moment she recognized the horrified look on Byleth’s face, a large, manic grin spread across her own.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor? What’s wrong–” Edelgard began to ask before there was a burst of heat and both the sound of screams and the smell of burning flesh began to fill the room as Bias simply grabbed the nearest student by the throat and burned them alive.</p><p> </p><p>“NO!” Byleth screamed, pushing Edelgard behind her as she drew her sword and swung at the manic Agarthan, who spread her arms wide as though happily accepting the blade about to carve through her chest. But before it did, she cast one more spell, and that entire half of the room exploded in fire. As she felt her flesh begin to burn amid the screams of her students, Byleth forced herself back, further than she'd ever gone before.</p><hr /><p>Sitting up in her bed, Byleth grit her teeth, before slamming her fist into the wall. Ignoring the stinging pain in her hand, the professor quickly got dressed and rushed out of her room. She couldn't hesitate, she needed to make sure Bias couldn't hurt anyone else. </p><p> </p><p>She knocked on Edelgard’s door, practically pounding her fist against the wood. “Edelgard, can you open up?”</p><p> </p><p>She heard movement inside, and luckily, her student heard her too. “Professor? What’s wrong?” </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t answer, just waiting for a moment before she shoved her way in once the door was opened, ignoring Edelgard’s exclamation.</p><p> </p><p>“We need to talk. I know who the infiltrators are,” Byleth said, panting from the running she had just done. “And…I know your secret.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"...you know my secret?" Edelgard asked, feeling herself tense on instinct.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I know this is going to sound weird, but I have the ability to turn back time, and you confessed to me the last time around,” Byleth quickly explained.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard blinked, feeling the tension leave her body at the sheer absurdity of what her professor said. "Excuse me?"</p><p> </p><p>"Agh, what did we say last time…oh, wait, you told me about the Goddess Tower and how your parents met there, how it was love at first sight and that you wanted something similar!" Byleth remembered, trying to focus all while she felt a strong adrenaline rush going through her body from the multiple times she had reset today. </p><p> </p><p>"...W-What?" Edelgard asked, feeling her face warm up as the words registered. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, that was it–Look, it’s not important. You confessed to me and I know everything. I especially know about Kronya and Bias, and we need to stop Bias so she doesn’t kill Kronya or you or Ignatz.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, please, professor, you’re–What happened to Ignatz?”</p><p> </p><p>“She grabbed him and set him on fire, it was bad. Now, the important part is that we need to get to her before the ball. I thought I was being clever and she would stay at the Goddess Tower but she didn’t because I guess I didn’t fully understand how willing she is to divert from her plans. She’s also crazy, that’s important to know, and, ah…right, so, the main point here is that we need to get her before the gala ever happens. As long as we make sure to take her down before she can do anything, then that's what matters."</p><p> </p><p>“...I…see. I…professor, while this sounds far too serious to be something you would joke about, I…you understand, it’s very hard to believe that you can travel through–”</p><p> </p><p>“Like I said, I know everything. Your secret, that Emily is Kronya, that Selene is Bias, all that stuff.” Byleth grabbed Edelgard by the shoulders. “Listen, I know this might be hard to believe, but just…please, trust me.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard slowly nodded. “Of course. Ah…well, I know Bias is pretending to be the librarian, so...no, if she’s planning something tonight, she likely won’t be there today. If her plan is at the Goddess Tower, she might head there early on to ensure her trap is ready. How is Kronya involved?”</p><p> </p><p>“Bias takes her hostage.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard blinked at that information, but decided she could ask later. “Right, then if Kronya goes to the gala, then Bias needs to be there–”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, damn it, she must have gone looking for her when she didn’t–But she didn’t leave until I left–No, never mind, I can’t think about that,” Byleth decided, interrupting herself, “If we get to Bias before the gala, it won’t matter. Knowing she’s the librarian is helpful, probably would’ve been helpful last time, though, I guess after I pushed you down, the detail might have slipped your mind." </p><p> </p><p>"...H-Huh?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yeah, sorry I, um…after you confessed to me, I pushed you down onto your bed without thinking." Byleth admitted, looking away from Edelgard with a faint sense of shame, remembering how she almost stabbed her student.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard, on the other hand, felt her face flush at the thought of Byleth taking the initiative like that. </p><p> </p><p>After a moment, Byleth shook the thought off, focusing again. "Either way, we'll need to be careful. You need to make sure to keep an eye on Kronya, and I'll make sure Bias doesn't even get a chance to enact her plans.”</p><p> </p><p>"...and what about you professor? You'd still be in danger." </p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry, I still have another charge left. I can still turn things back if I need to," Byleth lied, before reaching over and patting Edelgard on the head. "Just make sure everyone stays safe and has fun, okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Very well, professor." </p><p> </p><p>"Thanks. Oh, and make sure to tell Dorothea what you told me okay? It's only fair that she gets to hear it too.” She paused as a thought occurred. “Hm. Or would you prefer if I'm there with you when you confess?" </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard stared at her teacher. "You are…okay with her and…I…we?" </p><p> </p><p>"Why wouldn't I be?"</p><p> </p><p>The complete lack of hesitation or guile in her professor’s question put Edelgard at a loss for words as she just stared at Byleth. “...” So, in lieu of a verbal response, she just nodded slowly as she tried her best to fight down the blush that tried to grow on her face. “V…Very well then.”</p><p> </p><p>"Good. Now then…Bias mentioned being a ‘scientist’, do you think that might matter? Like where she might choose to hide?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hm. I…do not know. I don’t know where she hides out when she isn’t going around as Selene, but most of the clergy live within the monastery. If she were preparing something, she would likely want to do her work away from the monastery then…there are forests and ruins nearby. Perhaps she’s keeping a hideout out there?”</p><p> </p><p>"That's as good a place as any to check," Byleth murmured as she got up. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, wait, before you go." Standing up, Edelgard took a deep breath. "I understand that ‘I’ might have confessed already, however I feel as if it would be disingenuous if <em> I </em>didn't confess as well." </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, are you sure?” Byleth asked, a little concerned, “Things were…kind of tense last time, though…thinking about it, I guess that means it would be better to hear this time around? Hm.” She met Edelgard’s eyes, before nodding. “Alright, if it would make you feel better, I would be happy to hear your confession.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard closed her eyes to steady herself before staring at Byleth. "My teacher, in this year that I've known you, you've become one of my closest confidants and assisted me in so many ways. I know that we come from far different ways of life and that our meeting was a coincidence but…I don't think I can ever imagine a life without you, or at least I don't want to. Thank you, for choosing the Black Eagles, for choosing me," Edelgard smiled as she took Byleth’s hands. "I love you." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked. “Oh. That…thank you. I…did not expect to hear that. I think there was a misunderstanding. I was referring to you confessing to being the Flame Emperor.”</p><p> </p><p>“...oh.” Edelgard’s face began to burn. "...Would it be possible for you to reverse time by a few minutes?" </p><p> </p><p>“Edelgard, that would be a grave misuse of my powers.” Also she didn’t have a charge, but she wasn’t going to say that. Also, Edelgard was still holding her hands and Byleth wasn’t sure if she should pull away, mostly because she didn’t really want to–And, of course, more importantly, her student just made an emotional confession and she should support her in this confusing time.</p><p> </p><p><em> …my student just confessed to me. </em> Or maybe she should leave, because now she was having confusing thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>Neither of them were letting go of the other’s hands though…</p><p> </p><p>She briefly tried to call upon Sothis for advice, only to be met with raucous laughter from her friend. </p><p> </p><p>"I think it might be best if we focus on the mission, for now," Edelgard decided as she gently pulled away from Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"...Y-Yeah, we can talk more once everyone is safe," Byleth agreed before she cleared her throat. "Just, um…I'm sorry for not having a proper response right now. I don't really know much about matters of romance." </p><p> </p><p>"That's okay. Neither do I, really." Edelgard took a breath, trying to calm herself. "Talking later sounds like a good idea." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I'll see you later," Byleth agreed, about to head out before pausing to look back at Edelgard, "Take care, Edelgard."</p><p> </p><p>"You too, my teacher…are you sure I shouldn’t–"</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing,” Byleth assured her, “Just let me handle everything.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Understood.” </p><p> </p><p>Once she had left Byleth made it as far as the stairs before stopping. <em> Oh no, did I steal Edelgard away from Dorothea? </em></p><p> </p><p>For some reason that made Sothis laugh harder. </p><hr /><p>It had been some time since Byleth had to track a target, but the mercenary-turned-professor found herself slipping back into the rhythm of it easily enough as she sought out the Agarthan called Bias, who she was fairly certain still wore her “Selene” guise. At least, that was what she hoped.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t easy trying to track down the disguised Agarthan. Byleth hadn’t looked into the clergy much previously, considering it hadn’t been a problem before now, but now she knew where they slept, so that was nice to know. It didn’t help her find Selene though, especially since no one had seen her all morning. Byleth wound up going around the entire monastery without finding her, largely because it was so busy and there were far more clergy members at the monastery than she realized. </p><p> </p><p>It didn’t help that she did get a little sidetracked helping out with setting up for the ball…</p><p> </p><p>Ultimately, it wasn’t until after lunch, which she actually did have to eat because tracking a person while stressed and hungry was a bad idea, that she managed to catch sight of the blonde ‘nun’ walking into the cathedral.</p><p> </p><p>Once she spotted her there, it was a matter of waiting while Byleth decided to take some time “doing chores” for the church. The saint statues were looking pretty nice, but she made sure to clean them up some more, and a bit of choir practice was nice. From what she could tell, Bias had headed into the Goddess Tower, which…no, confronting her there was a bad idea. She had way too many examples of how badly it could go if she confronted her in an enclosed space like that…</p><p> </p><p>So on she waited, staying in the cathedral until the disguised Agarthan was about to leave. If Bias thought it odd that Byleth was in the Cathedral answering questions from the advice box, she didn't show it. Though Byleth did have to stay focused since she nearly let herself get distracted with coming up with good answers. </p><p> </p><p>Even if it was for cover, she wanted to make sure to offer proper advice! </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Song and dance live on in our memories, but there’s no real record of them. Even memories fade over time. Will anyone remember when I’m gone? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused. She recognized the handwriting. She didn’t expect something that heavy from Dorothea, but as she thought about the songstress’s worries, she also couldn't help but think of how this was her last shot. If she wasn't able to take down Bias… </p><p> </p><p><em> I’m sure you’ll live on in someone’s heart. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Returning the slip of paper to the box, Byleth took in a deep breath, before slapping her cheeks to focus as she left the cathedral. Moving ahead of Bias, she had Sothis keep an eye behind her on the Agarthan before pausing when the disguised mage took a turn, heading outside of the monastery in the direction of the ruins. </p><p> </p><p>Frowning, Byleth began to follow Bias, staying as quiet as she could while following the false librarian. She had one shot at this; if the Agarthan knew she was there, she'd rush off to kill as many people as she could. She was too far away for the Sword of the Creator to reliably hit, and a spell would take too long to hit her. At least once they got to the ruins they'd be away from the monastery…</p><p> </p><p>As silly as it was, a part of her wished she'd get back in time for the ball. </p><p> </p><p>By the time they arrived at the ruins, the afternoon was turning towards evening. The aftermath of the fight against Aelfric was still evident with all the scarring littering the remains. Shaking her head of the thought of Jeralt’s former friend, she focused on the mage, before attempting to approach her. </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me, do you have eyes on the back of your head, or did you spend several attempts trying to figure out where I was going?" Bias called out, getting Byleth to stiffen. "I'm going to assume it's the former since you didn't know about the alarm you set off. In which case…well, I suppose I should have expected someone like you to have extra eyes." </p><p> </p><p>"..." </p><p> </p><p>"She doesn't know about me at least. That’s good, it means she doesn't know everything. I just wish we knew how she found out about the divine pulse,” Sothis muttered. Byleth tried to settle her nerves before she stepped out into the open. </p><p> </p><p>"So you are by yourself. Tell me, are you that afraid of me killing someone, or are you that arrogant?" Bias asked, eyeing the professor. </p><p> </p><p>"...The students deserve to enjoy their time at the ball," Byleth said, leveling her sword at the Agarthan, who blinked, before beginning to laugh. </p><p> </p><p>"Seriously? You come out here on your own for someone like that? My, you're either the most soft-hearted beast around, or the dumbest. Personally, I'm leaning towards the latter," Bias remarked, before taking a few steps back when Byleth tried stepping closer. "I quite think this distance is good enough between us." </p><p> </p><p>"...How did you find out about the divine pulse?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Oh you never learned how I know? Well…I could tell you, or I could leave it to the next me. Presuming you have another charge. Tell me, I know you started with three, but surely you've increased that limit since awakening it. How many do you have left?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I have enough." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, so this is your last one," Bias said, her grin threatening to break the face she wore. "In that case, I suppose I should tell you. Kronya isn't the only ‘infiltrator’~" </p><p> </p><p>Byleth felt her blood run cold. "What?" </p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry, I'll make sure to tell you before you die. Until then, feel free to rattle around that empty head of yours for an answer." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth tried to focus. Who could have told her about the divine pulse? The only ones who knew besides Edelgard, who only just learned about it, were Jeralt, Shez, and Arval. None of them would have betrayed her…right? </p><p> </p><p>“Oh that’s a much better expression for you. That sense of betrayal…” Bias giggled. “Who do you think told me, hm? I mean, there can only be so many you ever told your greatest secret too…and only so many who would willingly tell me too.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I can figure that out later,” Byleth decided, “First, I need to end you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Heh. I suppose you’re hoping for a grand, final showdown then?” Bias looked around the ruins with a small smile. “It’s not the worst place to die…but, unfortunately for us both, if you’re here, it means I can’t have that finale. What a miserable outcome…”</p><p> </p><p>“...Are you really so willing to die to achieve your vengeance?”</p><p> </p><p>“You should know that already. I imagine I must’ve killed myself at least once to spite you. Either way, it doesn’t matter.” She raised a hand and snapped her fingers, smiling as a roar sounded out. “I packed about seven demonic beasts in a nice little chapel down that way. They were sealed in, getting hungrier and hungrier, and I just broke that seal, which means they’ll be running rampant if you don’t handle them. Consider it a parting gift.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I can kill you, then handle the demonic beasts,” Byleth pointed out, her eyes narrowed, “I think you’re a bigger threat.”</p><p> </p><p>“Aw. I’m flattered.” She didn’t sound like she was.</p><p> </p><p>Neither said a word as they stared at one another, both waiting to see what move the other would make. The roar of a demonic beast pierced through the evening sky as the chapel they were locked in began to break and crumple. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, since you won't be going away, I suppose I'll take the honor of your first, and last, dance this lovely evening," Bias said as a glyph appeared before her. </p><p> </p><p>Not wasting a moment, Byleth rushed forward, her sword lashing out once she got in range, only to bounce off a protective barrier that had already been prepped.</p><p> </p><p>"Please don't insult me by thinking you can kill me that easily," Bias chided while Byleth sprinted towards her, her sword snapping together as she prepared to slash through the barrier and glyph.</p><p> </p><p>Then the glyph vanished, the spell dropping. It was the only warning Byleth had that something was wrong before a flash of pain went through her head. She flinched back, clutching at the wound in her face, blood trailing down her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>She frowned, backing up as she watched Bias twirl a dagger in hand. "Ooo, don't tell me you didn't realize I had this on me before~ I may be a mage, but that doesn’t mean I can't defend myself with a knife." </p><p> </p><p>Not saying a word, Byleth did her best to heal the damage, even if it did little to fix the cut made by Agarthan weaponry. </p><p> </p><p>"You know, with you out of the way, there's nothing I really need to worry about. I can handle that little traitor quite easily, oh and the princess will certainly need to go. After all, that bitch lied to me and said you had no hand in Pittacus's death. Oh, I think dragging your corpse in front of her would be such a lovely gift, wouldn't it?" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth felt her blood begin to boil, her grip tightening on her sword enough to hurt. </p><p> </p><p>The sight made Bias smile as she playfully tapped the dagger against her chin. "Though I wonder, should I start with your class or save them for last? I suppose it doesn't matter, as long as I make them regret ever becoming close to you. Ah, but don't worry, I'll make sure to leave your sister alive. She's far too valuable of a test subject." </p><p> </p><p>Unable to keep the scowl off her face, Byleth nearly rushed in. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait!" Sothis shouted, getting Byleth to stop. "You know she's trying to get you to lose your cool! As long as she can kill you, she doesn't care about living or dying!"</p><p> </p><p>Byleth continued to glare at Bias, before letting out a breath she didn't realize she was holding as she tried to make a plan. One she wouldn't have much time to prepare since she heard the demonic beasts begin to free themselves. </p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry, Sothis. I promised not to die," Byleth murmured before rushing forward again. Bringing the sword up, she plainly telegraphed a slash down at Bias. </p><p> </p><p>"Ha, of course you want to use brute force you igno–" Bias felt her mind stutter for a moment, confusion hitting her as Byleth let go of the sword, the legendary relic weapon flying in the air which she couldn't help but track. </p><p> </p><p>It was only at the last moment that she glanced down to see a dagger coming straight at her. The air left her lungs as Byleth stabbed her straight in the chest, driving the blade in deep, though she reacted quickly and shoved her hand against the Fell Star’s face, right against the eye she’d already slashed.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth bit back a scream at the heat that burned her face, but fought through the pain and pulled her dagger free, stabbing again and again–</p><p> </p><p>And then something huge and heavy slammed against her side. She felt her feet leave the ground, her dagger flying free before she hit the dirt with a pained grunt, her face feeling like it was on fire as she saw a demonic beast in a stone mask roar towards the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Half her vision was gone, but she looked around quickly, trying to spot the Sword of the Creator…and finding Bias first as the bleeding Agarthan pushed up to her feet, blood pouring down her front through a number of stab wounds. Bias met her gaze for a moment, fury in her eyes, before more roars caught their attention.</p><p> </p><p>The Agarthan scowled…but she stumbled away, pressing a glowing hand to her own chest while Byleth managed to get to her feet and grab her sword from where it had landed, the weight of it feeling familiar in her hand as she turned to face at least half a dozen demonic beasts.</p><p> </p><p>“...this is going to be difficult,” she murmured, letting out a slow breath. It was fine though. </p><p> </p><p>Everyone she cared about was going to be fine.</p><hr /><p>Kronya was anxious. She wasn't sure why, but she hated it. All she needed to do was take that dumb professor up to the goddess tower, and then she could go home. She didn't have to think, she could go back to enjoying mindless slaughter. Maybe even start with…bandits or something. </p><p> </p><p><em> Bandits? Seriously? Why did my mind default to that and not a church full of those dull-eyed beasts. In fact, why don't I just start on the people here? </em>Kronya thought to herself before bumping into someone. "Hey, watch it!"</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, Emily," Dedue apologized, glancing down at the Agarthan. "I didn't see you there." </p><p> </p><p>"...geh, just make sure not to do it again," Kronya scoffed as she looked at who Dedue was with. "Oh, you're Mercedes, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"That I am, did you need something?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, just…" Kronya huffed, unsure of what to say. <em> What am I even doing? Just stab her. </em>"...the big guy is a good cook. Treat him nice, okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Mercedes couldn't help but giggle. "Of course, thanks for checking on him." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah yeah." Kronya huffed, walking away and ignoring the pair smiling. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Em!" Only to stiffen as Shez called out to her. "Where are you going?" </p><p> </p><p>"...out, I need fresh air." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh? Not going to dance?" she asked as she glanced down at her uniform. "I know you didn't get dressed up, but that doesn't mean you can't dance." </p><p> </p><p>"Well I'm sorry I don't look as ridiculous as you." </p><p> </p><p>"Pft, aw, but I thought I looked nice," Shez said, swishing her dress around with a laugh. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course you do… hey where is your sister?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh I dunno. She’s been running around a lot today for some reason. I was just guessing she was busy, though it’s kinda a shame. I wanted her to see my dress.” She huffed, looking a little disappointed before shaking it off. “Did you need something from her?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah I…needed to ask her something," Kronya said, feeling uncharacteristically nervous. </p><p> </p><p>"...wait, don't tell me." Shez leaned forward with a frown on her face as Kronya felt a small bit of panic. "You have a crush on my sister, don't you?"</p><p> </p><p>“...” <em> Sometimes I forget she’s genuinely fucking stupid. </em> “No, I don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“You sure? She’s objectively cute.”</p><p> </p><p>“...wha…” <em> How the fuck do I even respond to that? </em> “Yeah, I’m sure I don’t have a crush on your sister because she’s not my type, dumbass.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm, if you say so,” Shez replied with a shrug, before glancing at her curiously, “What’s your type anyways?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck if I know. I guess…someone taller than me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Like Dedue?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…like Mercedes?”</p><p> </p><p>“Also no.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay so not the tallest people…Hm, this is kinda tricky, since you’re so short.”</p><p> </p><p>“...shut up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nah, I’m gonna keep chatting until I figure it out.” She paused, a thought occurring. “Hey, do you want to dance with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Kronya stared at her for a moment…then shrugged. “Sure, why not?”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t like Bias was calling on her, and…well, it might be nice.</p><p> </p><p>And it actually was. Kronya wouldn’t call herself a good dancer, but it wasn’t like Shez was either. It was…nice. Everybody seemed to be having a good time too…well, aside from the princess, who was chatting with that blond prince and looked like someone just punched her in the gut.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually though, Shez actually started frowning as she looked around.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s up?” Kronya asked, glancing up at her.</p><p> </p><p>“...It’s just…I’m not seeing Byleth around at all. I thought she might be busy, but it’s getting late, right? She should be here.”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Kronya stilled, her thoughts going to Bias. <em> Did she change her plan? </em> “...Maybe we should look for her?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…yeah, that’s actually a good idea. Let’s go see if we can find her.”</p><p> </p><p>So Shez and Kronya left the ballroom, not really heading in a specific direction but just kind of looking around. And just her luck, Emily ran right into someone she didn't want to see. </p><p> </p><p>"Emily? Shez? Where are you two going?" Edelgard asked while Dorothea had a knowing smile behind her. </p><p> </p><p>“Ah…not really sure, I was just following Emily,” Shez admitted, shrugging, “We’re looking for By. Have you seen her around?”</p><p> </p><p>"...no, we were actually looking for her," Edelgard said, glancing at Kronya. "I saw her earlier today, but she said she would be busy with something." </p><p> </p><p>"I will admit, I'm a bit sad she didn't show up at the ball, but she's probably fine. If she got my letter, then I certainly know one place where she might be," Dorothea said, winking at Edelgard. </p><p> </p><p>"I just want to make sure she's okay," Edelgard responded, even as her face turned pink. </p><p> </p><p>The scraping of a sword against stone caught their attention. Focusing, the group looked towards where the noise was coming from, ready for whatever came closer, only to stare in horror. </p><p> </p><p>Dragging the Sword of the Creator on the floor, her clothes tattered and blood soaked, Byleth approached the group with a slow, stumbling walk. Glancing up, Byleth smiled and raised a hand as the wind blew her hair to the side, revealing a bloody, burned wound where her right eye once was. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey there, sorry I'm late." Was all she said before she collapsed. </p>

  <p>
  <span>“Stupid bitch stabbed me in the tit,” Bias complained to herself as she glared down at the mess of wounds her chest had become thanks to a certain professor, who happened to be surprisingly proficient with a dagger. Or maybe not that surprisingly, considering how proficient the Fell Star seemed to be with just about everything. “Fhhh…almost had her. Almost.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But almost wasn’t good enough. Even if she’d gotten that last fireball off, it didn’t stop the Fell Star from stabbing her nearly a dozen times. She would’ve been dead if that demonic beast hadn’t barreled into the two of them right at that moment…Dead, and without killing the Fell Star to make it worth it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t believe for a second that the demonic beasts managed to kill her. Not after everything. No, she wouldn’t believe anything could kill that stubborn bitch until she did it herself, no matter what it took.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias growled in frustration, glaring down at scars littering her torso. Healing magic hadn’t worked fast enough, so a good portion she’d just burned closed to stop herself from bleeding out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even now, she felt woozy, exhausted…but alive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Bias let her head fall against the tree trunk behind her as she stared up at the moon above, the dusk having faded to night in the hours she took dragging herself away from her ill-fated “final battle”. Not that there was anything really “final” about it. Not while she and the woman she hated the most in the world were still alive. “...heh. Should’ve brought Kronya with me. Even if she didn’t work as a hostage, I could’ve at least used the Spell of Zahras…wonder what she’ll do now, without me there? All alone…poor little puppy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She chuckled, before pushing herself up. The robes she’d worn as “Selene” were a bloodied mess, not worth wearing at this point, so she let the guise fall away, returning to a more “natural” appearance, as far as any Agarthan had a natural appearance. At the very least, the flesh she wore felt more like her now…and she had a nice dress on again, so that was a plus.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even the wounds she took faded as her skin turned pale, though it wasn’t as though her body repaired itself. She could still feel that pain, the sense of being hurt. She still felt drained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But her mind still worked. And it worked quickly, considering her next course of action.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She’d have to go to Ordelia. Myson’s plans clearly centered around that scrap of territory, and if she had other Agarthans to back her, she could still win. Even if it took everything she had, especially if it took everything </span>
  <em>
    <span>they</span>
  </em>
  <span> had, she would end that bitch. One way or another.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Jeralt didn’t know what it was about the Academy that made the most innocuous event turn into some major disaster. Seriously, the month of the ball should’ve been a time to take it easy, relax, and let his kids have fun. Not a time to have to deal with a pack of demonic beasts let loose by a mad mage who also just so happened to </span>
  <em>
    <span>take one of his daughter’s eyes.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So yeah. He wasn’t happy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So remind me again what happened," he asked, staring down at the leader of the Black Eagles.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Dorothea had gone out looking for the professor, as we hadn't seen her at the ball. While searching we ran into Shez and Emily, before the professor appeared in the state she was in." Edelgard took a small breath, unable to meet his eyes. "She…The professor came by my room earlier, saying she might not be able to make it to the ball and that she had something important to do. If…If I had known this would have happened…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Jeralt sighed. "I don't think anyone would have." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Captain Jeralt, I swear on my honor as the Emperor, that you will have the empire's full support in defeating the mage who harmed the professor," Edelgard said as she stood up, her hands balling up into fists. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You're heading back to the Empire soon, right?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, noon tomorrow." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, hopefully she wakes up before then," Jeralt muttered. He sighed. “...hey, princess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks for being there for my kid." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard opened her mouth, stayed silent for a few moments, before she closed it, and simply bowed to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt remained in his chair, staring up at the ceiling for a few minutes, before getting up and heading over to the nurse's office. It wasn't a long walk, but each step tired him, before he entered the room. The room was empty, safe for one person laying in a bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The slow rise and fall of her chest let him know she was still alive but…he couldn't look away from her face, bandages covering the right side. He always knew his kids would be in danger when they became mercenaries. But…he should have stopped them from becoming mercenaries in the first place. Maybe then he wouldn't have to deal with seeing them almost die so many times… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...you're not allowed to die before me," Jeralt muttered, staring down at his daughter and wondering just why the goddess had it out for them…</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Shez was furious, so much so that the word was practically an understatement. She didn't know who this Selene person was, but when she found her, she was going to gut her! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And yet, for as angry as she was at the bitch that took her sister’s eye, she was just as angry at herself for spending the whole night dancing and playing around while Byleth was fighting for her life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You must remain calm, partner." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't tell me what to do!" Shez snapped, as she continued marching along, looking for the ruins. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you keep walking in a random direction you're going to get lost. Do you even know where the old cathedral ruins are?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll find them eventually. And then I'll find a clue on where the bitch went!" Shez shouted as she continued to move, using her sword to cut down brush as she walked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Arval sighed, trying to think of how to play this. Bias may have failed, but it would be a waste to let his vessel kill her. If only he could simply eliminate the Fell Star himself…the problem was, the risk to his vessel was too great, particularly given the guard she was under. "...would it not be better to stay at the monastery, near your sister? After all, there's a chance that 'Selene' might return while you're gone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jerking to a halt, Shez couldn't help but scowl before screaming as she slashed with her sword again, cutting a tree in two with ease. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Fine," she muttered after a few moments, before warping back to the monastery. Arriving back in her room, Shez flopped down on her bed, feeling far too frustrated but unsure of how to channel it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn't know how long she was in her room, but it didn’t feel that long before she heard someone knock on her door. With a huff, she walked over and yanked it open. "What?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hello, Shez," Edelgard greeted, noticeably stiff, "I…came to check on how you were doing." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Angry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...That is understandable. What happened to the professor is horrible, and I–"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't want to hear it! Well wishes aren't going to heal my sister!" Shez shouted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yes, condolences and the like can't fix the past," Edelgard muttered, looking down and sending a tinge of guilt through Shez’s heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, shit. Sorry. I…I know you went through a lot too, it's just…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's alright Shez. Regardless of any similarities in our situations, only you can understand your own sadness. Any words I can give will only end up falling flat. Even so, I'll say this, even if it costs me my life, I'll make sure Those Who Slither can't hurt anyone else. And I promise you, that if you want to make them pay, then you'll have my help." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...ugh. Thanks for that. I…ugh…” Shez sighed, feeling emotionally exhausted and yet still angry. “...Do you know anything about this Selene lady?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do, yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused. She didn’t actually expect an answer to that question. “...what do you know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know her true name is Bias…She is a sage, which is apparently a position of importance in their society. And I…I knew who she was for some time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez sat up. She stared straight at Edelgard, her eyes narrowed in a glare as her anger built up again. “...what the hell do you mean by that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I've had dealings with her in the past. I used her as much as she used me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That–Why didn't you say anything!?" Shez shouted, pushing herself up from the bed and approaching Edelgard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Because I was afraid. Afraid that if I sold her out, she would sell me out as well. Afraid that I would be locked away in a dungeon for the rest of my life…Afraid of what the professor would think of me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez’s hands clenched into fists hard enough that her knuckles audibly popped. “...Is that why you didn’t want to go to Rhea about Lysithea’s problem? You didn’t want to screw yourself over? Cause you matter more than anyone else, huh, princess?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard bit back her response, knowing fully well it would only make things worse. "...The church elevates those with crests. Even if we ignore the fact that they would have no idea about someone with dual crests, the possibility that they'd experiment on others isn't a risk I'm willing to take." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“IT’S NOT YOUR RISK TO TAKE! THEY COULD’VE HELPED HER!” Shez shouted, completely furious, “I sided with you because Byleth thought you had a point, but you were just covering your ass! How long have you been using us, huh?! Do you even give a shit–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course I care. I want Lysithea to be cured of her condition, that is why I offered to host her in the Empire,” Edelgard stated, keeping her calm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh really? How can I believe that? You just admitted to being best friends with the bitch who took my sister’s eye, who’s to say you wouldn’t turn Lysithea over to your buddies for an extra favor?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Do not insinuate that the people who murdered every last one of my siblings are my friends.” Edelgard’s tone was deadly cold as she spoke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then why would you work with them!?” Shez’s voice, in contrast, was practically hot with rage. “What, did you work with Aelfric too and handed Byleth over to him!?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop making wild accusations–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What am I supposed to believe, huh?! You just told me I can’t trust anything you tell me because you’ve been lying for, what, the entire year?!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even if you don't believe me, you need to understand that I would never do anything to harm the professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"THEN WHY DID SHE ALMOST DIE!?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Because she told me she could still rewind time!" Edelgard shouted back. "When she visited me…she said that it would be okay because she still had another chance to do things over."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That took the wind out of Shez’s sails. "...what? She…she told you she could do that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. She did. She told me exactly what her powers were and how she has used them previously. And she assured me she still had one more chance to turn things back. So…so I suppose she must have considered this a better outcome.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Or she lied to you,” Shez bluntly pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes, that is more likely. I suppose I prefer to think she wouldn’t do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I imagine that’s because you don’t like it when you’re lied to. Like most people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez sighed. “That sounds like By though. Always trying to make everyone else happy and being stupid about it…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I would not put it like that; but that's not inaccurate. Even so, she told me, even after I supposedly told her everything in a past timeline," Edelgard explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez couldn't help but scowl. "It's because she's being stupid that I need to make sure she's okay. I don't care what you're planning on doing, but stay away from By. I don't want you near her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…Very well. I only ask that you not interfere if she wishes to seek me out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would I do that for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do not expect you to do so for my sake. I hope you would do so for Professor Byleth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...How much of this have you told her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Everything. I told her everything,” Edelgard stated without hesitation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez looked away. "Just get out of my room." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remaining silent, Edelgard inclined her head, before leaving. Alone in her room, Shez could do little else but scream as she slammed her fist into the door. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Kronya stared down at the unconscious Byleth, watching the slow rise and fall of the injured professor’s chest as she slept. The bandages around her eye had been changed, so they weren’t as bloody. That was probably good.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Agarthan assassin let out a slow sigh. She wondered what she was doing. Bias was gone and she was on her own at the monastery. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What do I even do now…do I kill her? What would that actually get me…the sages would probably reward me for killing the Fell Star. Who knows, maybe they'd even make me a sage too. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sighing again, Kronya looked out the window to stare at the moon lighting the room. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Or maybe they'd just kill me if Bias told them I'm a traitor. That would be simpler, I guess. I wouldn't have to deal with all these emotions, at least…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Mnn…" Stiffening, she looked down and saw Byleth stir awake. Slowly opening her eyes, the professor looked around before noticing Kronya. And then, off all the reactions she could have, she smiled. "Kronya…you have no idea how happy I am to see that you're alive." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...why?” she murmured, feeling a strange stinging at her eyes. </span>
  <em>
    <span>That’s the first time anyone has ever said that to me…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, are you okay?” Byleth asked, actually looking worried despite the fact that Kronya just considered killing her. There was just genuine concern in her voice, and it made the assassin’s throat feel tight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Why are you so worried about me?” she managed to say, trying to figure out what the professor wanted–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought Bias might have hurt you. I’m glad to see that you’re okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So what if she hurt me? You know what I am." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I do. But you're still my student, even if you're in a different class now," Byleth said, smiling at her, “That’s all that matters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Kronya let out a shuddering breath. "That…I would have killed you. If it meant I could be safe." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You didn't. You could have but you didn't." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya wasn't sure how she could sound so confident but…somehow she was. As if she fully trusted her completely. "...moron." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey now, I might not be your professor anymore, but I can still give you detention." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not if I don’t stick around.” She meant her words to be a sharp retort, but they came out more like a mumble. She felt her face warm, but she huffed instead of acknowledging it, glancing away from the professor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Mm. Yeah, that’s true. I can understand why you’re considering leaving. After everything that happened…” Byleth sighed. “...I would prefer it if you felt safe enough to stay, but I understand if you don’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…I don’t think I feel safe anywhere. It would be stupid of me to stay here, but…no one cares about me back home. Bias hammered that into my head well enough. Anyone I think might be on my side would probably just use me up and then kill me afterwards…” She trailed off, thinking of how just a few months ago, she would’ve killed someone for talking like that. And now she meant every word. “Is Bias still alive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure. I stabbed her several times in the chest, but then a demonic beast broke loose and got between us. If no one found her body, then either she’s still out there, or the demonic beast might have eaten her. She did set a lot of them loose all at once.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m pretty sure she’d more likely eat a demonic beast than get eaten,” Kronya commented, “…is it weird I feel sort of relieved? I kinda want to stab her myself…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. I think that’s a reasonable feeling to have. I haven’t interacted with her all that much, but she seems very mean and unpleasant.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, she is. She’s always been a bitch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm…even when her sister was around?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronay blinked at the question, then actually thought about it. “...I mean, I didn’t interact with them all that much. She’s my superior, but I tended to do missions for Thales specifically–Ah, he was the Agastya.” At Byleth’s confused look, she huffed. “Our leader. The Sage of Light.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Ah, right, Bias mentioned him. She believes I killed him and her sister, though she’s more upset about her sister. Which…” Byleth lowered her gaze, a frown coming to her face. “...I think I can understand that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so I realize you’re having a moment, but what was that about you killing Thales?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth sighed. “I’m not sure. She said something about Pittacus being in a carriage with him, but I’m not sure what happened.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that figures.” Kronya sighed too, frowning. “Bias had this whole idea that Thales was killed by foul play and I guess Pittacus was just a casualty along with him. All I know is that he died in some landslide. Other than that, I don’t know enough about it to make a guess myself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something about that sounded familiar, but Byleth couldn’t remember why… “Hm…I’ll think about it later. Maybe…maybe there’s something I can do…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s not,” Kronya bluntly stated, “At this point, I don’t really care about Thales, but I know Bias still cares about Pittacus. Even if you didn’t kill her, I’ll bet Bias is latched onto that idea and won’t let it go until either of you are dead. She’s stubborn like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...mm. Are you going to be in danger from her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably, but I’m bound to be in danger from any Agarthan. If I don’t get a Dolofonos sent after me, I’ll be surprised.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“An assassin. I’m technically one of them. Built for murder, to the point that I’m pretty sure my brain is designed to feel pleasure when I kill people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked. “...your brain is designed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Designed, built, and grown by the masterful power of Agarthan alchemy, yeah,” Kronya affirmed, before smirking, “In fact, I, much like the rest of my people, wasn’t born the same way as you bea–ah…you Fodlaners. Agarthans don’t do anything as inefficient as pregnancy to produce new people, no, we use huge glass cylinders filled with weird liquid as a sort of artificial womb. And even then, that’s just how we grow the flesh bodies we use. You want to know what I actually am, professor? I’m a small sphere, about the size of one of those crest stones, created with Agarthan sorcery, imbued with an Agarthan soul, and implanted into a body made by Agarthan alchemy, which, according to Agarthan logic, makes me a </span>
  <em>
    <span>real</span>
  </em>
  <span> human.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth opened her mouth, struggling to think of a response. She had to imagine she looked very confused right now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez is probably the same too, might have even been designed for the same caste, but with the powers she has…well, I don't know for certain, but they might have tried to design a new sage." Kronya felt a bit amused when Byleth looked even more confused. "Agarthans use a caste system: servants, warriors, scientists. And at the top of everyone are the sages, our oh so great leaders who know and decide everything. Thales was even the one to come up with the caste system after our people were almost wiped out, saying that some people are just naturally more servile while others are leaders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...hm, thinking about it, it's actually very fucked up that they say that when we're literally designed to be in certain castes. It’s not really natural if we’re made to be that way,” Kronya noted, starting to realize how horrible things were back in Shambhala. "Man, it fucking sucks realizing your entire life is a lie." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Well, at least you have the chance to make your own life now," Byleth said, finally breaking through her stunned state. "I don't know when you're planning to leave, but you should leave a note." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You want me to leave a note to say I'm leaving?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez will probably be sad if you just leave without saying anything." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...F-Fine. I'll say I'm… going on a vengeance quest for my…father?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's Emily's uncle that I stabbed, not her dad," Byleth reminded, before smiling. "Don't worry, I'll come up with a good excuse. You just focus on saying goodbye." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah sure, whatever," Kronya replied, getting up and heading to Manuela's desk to grab some paper for herself–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, do you mind grabbing me a sheet as well?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…For herself and her professor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sitting back down, the two began to write, with Kronya going through several sheets as she crumpled them to start over with a new one. Eventually she finally managed to write something she was satisfied with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Here, give this to Shez," Kronya ordered, shoving the letter towards Byleth, before blinking as Byleth handed something to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Since you're not going to be here for graduation." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taking the paper, she unfolded it to see what was on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Certification of Graduation' </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>'Awarded to Kronya for being the best that she can be' </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the corner there was a crude drawing of Byleth giving her a thumbs up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Kronya swallowed the lump in her throat, her eyes burning with suppressed emotion. “...this’s stupid…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth tilted her head, watching as the Agarthan plainly tried to hold back tears. “...do you want me to take it back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. It’s stupid…but it’s mine,” she murmured, and something in her finally broke, causing genuine tears to start rolling down her face. "Fuck, I'm not even supposed to be able to cry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's healthy to cry. Sometimes you need to let your emotions out," Byleth said while Kronya did her best to wipe away her tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"S-Shut up," Kronya managed to get out, "I don't even know what I'm going to do when I leave…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well whatever you do, I'll make sure to find you," Byleth said, giving her best smile. "And if I don't, Shez will." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"S-Stop trying to make me cry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, sorry," Byleth apologized, looking only slightly sorry. "If it's okay…do you mind if we talk some more before you leave?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...got nothing better to do," Kronya mumbled as she looked away. The two settled in, talking the night away until Byleth began to drift off, exhaustion catching up to her and leaving Kronya on her own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Kronya thought to herself as she stood up. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Even if I never see them again, I'm not alone. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Goodbye professor. Until we meet again." </span>

  <p>
  <span>The mood around the monastery felt strange after the ball. News of how Professor Byleth had gotten into a fight with an infiltrator that left her grievously wounded spread at a haphazard rate through the student body, in large part because the events of the ball had left everyone happy to have a nice night off so the sudden switch to “One of the professors was maimed” left everyone off balance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then came the news that Emily Korsch, who most of the students had known as the aggressive girl from the Golden Deer, had vanished in the night without a trace. Well, without a deliberate trace, given that she had chosen to signal her departure by leaving a scrawled apology on the Golden Deer’s blackboard stating that she had to leave to “seek vengeance”. Which was…something.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With all that going on, Edelgard’s own departure from the monastery was nearly overshadowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What a time to leave, huh Edie?" Dorothea asked as she leaned against a pillar by the courtyard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If I could stay I would," Edelgard admitted, finding herself unable to offer a smile. "Yet an Emperor is beholden to her duties." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sadly," Dorothea replied, before gazing up at the goddess tower in the distance. "Heh, any chance we can sneak up the tower with the professor before you go?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't think we'll be able to," Edelgard responded, frowning as she remembered Shez’s words. "And…well, the professor needs the rest." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I know, it’s just…so much for trying to do something romantic." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure there will be other chances in the future," Edelgard said, trying to look forward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ooh? Are you finally agreeing to the three of us being together~?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I-If the professor is okay with it, then I won't say no."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, in that case you better make sure to visit her before you leave, okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'll make sure to do so," Edelgard murmured, before blinking as she felt a pair of lips against her cheek. Her face warmed as she looked up at a smiling Dorothea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You deserve to be loved, Edie. And I’m gonna make sure you know that every chance I get~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...m-mm. Then…I will do my best to return that love, as much as I am able.” She considered kissing Dorothea in return, her heart beating rapidly at the thought, before she simply took the songstress’s hand and kissed the back of it. “I promise, I will be back for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be waiting~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, Edelgard went to say the rest of her goodbyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Walking into the Black Eagles classroom, Edelgard silently regarded her classmates, nearly all of them in there despite classes being canceled for the day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, Edelgard." Noticing her first, Ferdinand stood up, getting everyone to turn towards her. "Are you…?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Thank you all for the memories we have developed throughout the year," Edelgard said, bowing to them. "It has been an honor to learn alongside you all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't suppose there's any chance we can convince you to stay longer?" Flayn asked, trying to put on a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah come on, things are way too dour right now!" Caspar shouted as he shot up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As much as I would agree with not doing anything, she is the emperor now," Lindhart pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She is the emperor, yes, but she is our friend as well,” Petra affirmed, before smiling at Edelgard, “It was good to be classmates with you, Edelgard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Make sure to take care, Eddy," Hapi murmured while Constance smiled at her, trying to remain bright despite the situation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Twoud be unseemingly for the newly appointed Emperor to run herself ragged from pushing herself too hard." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll keep that in mind. Thank you again." There was more to say, more goodbyes to be had and more affirmations of friendship, but soon enough Edelgard bowed to her classmates and left the classroom. So that just left a few more…stopping by the dorms, Edelgard knocked on a door and heard an involuntary squeak from inside from Bernadetta, huddled in her room again. "Bernadetta…I just wanted to say goodbye. Thank you for everything." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Y-You're really going?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes. I don't have a choice," Edelgard admitted despite the frown on her face. "Make sure to take care, okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To her surprise, the door opened, with Bernadetta standing there for a moment, before hugging her. Stiffening in surprise, Edelgard stayed silent before hugging her back. After several moments, Bernadetta backed away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"S-Sorry." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There's no need to apologize, Bernadetta. I needed it. I look forward to seeing you again,” Edelgard said, smiling at her housemate, who gave a sad one in response before closing her door. With that she went to her last classmate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a small trek, but she found herself in the cathedral, where the more pious students were praying. Near the back of the pews, she spotted a familiar blue-haired girl, and Edelgard approached her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...praying for the professor?" Edelgard asked, getting Marianne's attention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I…why does the professor have to suffer?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Edelgard didn't respond. How could she? The blame fell on her for not speaking up sooner. "I don't know, but she'll need everyone's help once Professor Manuela lets her get up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I wish you would be there to help. I-I…no. No, I know it’s selfish of me, but I still want you to be here instead of at Enbarr,” Marianne stated, looking at Edelgard with a surprising firmness in her gaze, “You’re…You’re someone I can believe in, Edelgard. I think we really are going to be lesser without you here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...heh. I would ask that you not tell that to Ferdinand. It would likely break his heart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…at least we'll all be here to help him," Marianne said, attempting to joke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure he'll appreciate that," Edelgard replied, before bidding her farewell, and making her way to Manuela's office. At least, that was the plan before she ran into Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I thought I told you to stay away from her," the purple-haired mercenary said, glaring at the emperor as she blocked the hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I simply wanted to say goodbye." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll tell her for you," Shez stated, not moving an inch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...you really won't let me see her?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just count yourself lucky I'm not gutting you right now–"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez?” The younger Eisner sibling went stiff, a very awkward look crossing her face as she glanced back and saw her sister staring at the two of them. “...what were you saying to Edelgard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Th-That, uh…wait, no, hang on, you should be in bed!” Shez quickly rallied, moving over to her sister with a worried look, though Byleth just frowned at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, why were you threatening Edelgard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because–Look, she’s not good for you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s not good for me?” Byleth interrupted, giving her sister a remarkably skeptical look while Shez fumbled with her words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite the earlier threat towards her, one Edelgard felt Shez probably would have made good on, the emperor stepped forward, catching Byleth’s attention. “Your sister was just feeling protective, professor. I think it was reasonable, given your recent injury.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Okay. You two are okay?” she asked, glancing between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez grimaced, but nodded. “Yeah, sure, we’re good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her glare toward Edelgard said the opposite, but the emperor chose to ignore it in favor of smiling at her professor. “Well, I simply wished to say goodbye, professor. I’m glad I was able to be your student for so long, and I appreciate everything you’ve done for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her professor’s bright smile made everything worth it. “Thank you, Edelgard. I’m very glad to have had you as my student. And I look forward to working with you in the future.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I look forward to your service." Edelgard said, smiling back. Byleth seemed to want to say something else, opening her mouth and struggling to find the words before Shez spoke up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, c’mon, we should get you back to bed,” Shez insisted, putting an arm around her sister’s shoulders and pulling her away from Edelgard, earning a pout from the professor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need to be in bed all the–Ah, goodbye Edelgard! I hope you have a pleasant journey home!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard smiled at her professor’s well wishes, before turning to leave. She wished she could have had more of a…affectionate goodbye, perhaps a hug or something, but considering she could still feel Shez boring a hole into her back with her glare, she didn’t want to push her luck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arriving at where her carriage was waiting, she saw Hubert standing nearby, a cat in hands. "Are you ready, your majesty?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"About as ready as I can be." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Edelgard." Stopping as she was about to board the carriage, the emperor turned to look at Dimitri approaching her. “Were you intending to leave without speaking to me again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Honestly, Dimitri, I was distracted.” She stepped away from the carriage and let out a small sigh. With a slight nod to Hubert, her retainer bowed in return as he moved to finish preparing the carriage. “My farewell to Shez did not go well, though I was at least able to say goodbye to Professor Byleth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, that’s good. Well, not the Shez part, she’s been…well, she has been agitated after her sister’s injury…Regardless. Is…Is now a good time to talk, or…?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's as good a time as any," Edelgard allowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's good, I was… really worried about you, Edelgard… to suddenly receive news that all your siblings had passed away, only to then hear your uncle did as well…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What happened, happened," Edelgard stated, "What matters now is that I move forward to ensure a better future." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You mentioned that your siblings had been…killed? What happened?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That…people like Solon were behind that tragedy. Behind many others as well. I wouldn't be surprised if they were the ones behind the Tragedy of Duscur, as well as fanning the flames between our nations." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His eyes widened. "Are you serious? Then we have to do something about it!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We can't do anything without knowing who exactly is behind those incidents," Edelgard said, frowning as she did, "As it stands, what I must do is deal with corruption in the Empire, and ensure war doesn't break out between it and the Alliance." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...This might sound odd to hear, but a part of me feels… relieved to know despite everything that has happened, you're still the same stubborn girl you used to be." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm. Is that how I look like to you?" Edelgard asked. "I'm not the same little girl from back then." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even so, it's comforting," Dimitri said, doing his best to smile. "...I truly hope we can work together so our nations can prosper." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I suppose we shall see," Edelgard replied, before nodding to her long lost friend, "It was nice to see you again, Dimitri." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As it was to see you, Edelgard." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, Edelgard boarded the carriage, noting that Hubert had chosen to sit up front, leaving her alone inside. She should make sure to thank him when given the chance…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, she felt the familiar weight of her cat settle in her lap. Quietly petting him, Edelgard couldn't help but wonder how long it would be until she saw her professor again. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Idly chewing on an apple, Byleth watched her sister with a raised eyebrow, waiting for Shez to figure out what it was she wanted to say. It seemed to be taking a while, considering her sister was pacing back and forth with a frown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well it’s hardly a wonder she’s frustrated. You were injured quite severely on our…admittedly ill-planned mission,” Sothis commented, frowning at herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm.” Byleth didn’t think it was that poorly planned. Sure, maybe she should have gotten some back-up, but that would’ve put people other than her in danger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can tell what you’re thinking and no, it was stupid. And I was a fool for getting so caught up in your drive to defeat that sorceress that I didn’t even think to suggest another course of action!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It worked though,” she murmured, which got Shez to pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you say something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I’m talking to Sothis. She thinks my plan was dumb.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez frowned. “Which plan is that? The one where you ran off on your own and almost got killed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...ah, well…yes. That one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then yeah, she’s right, that was stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth pouted at being ganged up on, huffing as she settled back in her bed. She reached for another apple slice, not noticing Shez’s frown deepening when she had to feel around a bit to grab one. “Everything worked out–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“YOU’RE MISSING AN EYE, BYLETH!” Shez finally snapped, her shout echoing in the infirmary, “You almost died! You almost died and you only have one eye now, why are you so fucking calm!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked, a little stunned. “Ah–Shez, it’s okay. I’m fine, I just need to work on my depth perception–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not the problem! Why would that be the problem!? You didn’t–Why didn’t you get me, huh!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I didn’t want to ruin your night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez closed her eyes, balling up her fists as she tried to fight down the frustration she felt hearing that. “You can’t…Byleth, that’s fucking stupid. Who cares about some dance, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do. I care. I wanted the night to be perfect for everyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“By, you can’t–You can’t do that! You can’t just–We’re supposed to be a team! You can’t go off on your own and almost die and–And I wouldn’t have even known! I would’ve been just, flouncing around in that stupid dress–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t stupid, you looked nice–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“YOU WEREN’T THERE! How could you even know, huh?!” Her hands clenched, her breath shaky as she tried to calm herself down, before she let out a little laugh. “Right, no, I’m being stupid, you turned back time, right? You…You just turned back the clock, and…did you try to take me with you? Did…Did something happen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth felt her mouth get dry. “I…ah…I…didn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you didn’t bring me with you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The hurt in her voice made Byleth’s stomach twist in an uncomfortable way. “I wanted you to have fun–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you–Seriously?! I…I don’t care about that! I would’ve dropped everything to help you! Why wouldn’t you try to get help!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did! I did try, I went to Edelgard–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You went to her?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I–Yes! What’s wrong with Edelgard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s wrong with–You know she knew the whole time, right!? That that bitch Selene or Bias or whatever was here in disguise and she just…didn’t tell anyone! That the whole reason she didn’t want to go to the Church with info about the Agarthans was because she didn’t want to get caught!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I–Did Edelgard tell you–?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“YOU COULD HAVE DIED, BY! Why isn’t this sinking in for you!? You could’ve died all on your own and I never would’ve known because she didn’t want to tell me!” Shez’s voice broke, tears starting to roll down her cheeks. “I can’t–I don’t care about a dance or a dress or any of that! I just…I could’ve helped. You know that…right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know. Of course I know,” Byleth reassured, trying to swallow the lump in her throat, “I wanted you to have a nice night. You looked so happy…how could I ruin that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...why did you go to her? Why her and not me? I’m your family…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...She wanted to meet me at the Goddess Tower. I wanted to ask…I wanted to…” Byleth took a breath, trying to get her jumbled thoughts in order. “I thought I could get her help and everything would turn out okay. I…I was mad too, when I learned, but I…she told me she loves me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stared at her sister. “...do you love her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…I don’t know. I was hoping I could figure that out.” She sighed. “Shez, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t go to you. I’m sorry I left you out. I didn’t…I wanted you to have a nice night and I’m sorry that I hurt you instead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez rubbed her eyes with her arm, brushing away some tears, then let out a huff. “...I don’t…I don’t like her. Even if you do, she lied to us for the entire year and she never would’ve said anything to me if you didn’t get hurt. And that’s messed up. What’s the point of telling me after you get hurt, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...It’s messy. I…I didn’t expect any of this to happen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well…me neither. So…I’m not giving my blessing or whatever. And I don’t know if I want you working for her either. She’s an asshole.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned. “Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m allowed to not like her! Her keeping secrets nearly got you killed!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...mm. I still want to go to the empire.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well…I’m coming along with you if you are,” Shez stated, refusing any argument, “Someone’s gotta look out for you now that you can’t look out for yourself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth blinked with her single eye. “...too soon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” After a second, Shez’s lips twitched. “Pff-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Snrk–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a moment, both sisters just started giggling, the fading tension in the air breaking completely as they laughed together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth brushed a tear from her eye and nodded firmly. “Okay, so…you might not like her, but the plan is still on. We can figure things out with her later, I’m sure of it. Ah, maybe I should send a letter–Oh, right, did you get your letter from K–ah, Emily?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “My what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, did she…maybe she left it somewhere around here?” Byleth started patting herself down, frowning in thought as she tried to remember if Kronya had handed her the letter or if she’d left it somewhere close by.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Frowning, Shez glanced around before she noticed a slip of paper under the plate of apples. Reaching over, she pulled it out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hey idiot, meet me at the mock battlefield. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Short and to the point, I see." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Oh, you found it!" Byleth said, smiling as Shez pocketed the letter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, guess I should go meet her before it gets dark," Shez said with a small huff. "Well, I should probably get something to eat before I do. You wanna go down with me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…maybe not. I probably should get some rest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh so now you want to stay in bed.” Shez huffed again. “I see how it is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I do need my rest…maybe you could bring me something later?” Byleth asked leadingly, earning an eye roll from her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine, fine, I’ll bring you something sweet. But you’d better actually rest! If I get back here and I find out you went running around the monastery, I’m gonna tie you to that bed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I solemnly swear that I shall remain in bed until your return,” Byleth promised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You better.” And with that, Shez headed out, still feeling agitated. She’d save that aggression for someone that deserved it though. Her sister didn’t deserve her anger.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“...Maybe I should’ve argued against her going with Edelgard,” Shez muttered as she trudged through the woods, a deep frown on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why? Do you wish to upset your rival further?” Arval inquired, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, that’s not it. I just…I’m not sure if I want Edelgard to have any actual power over Byleth. Not when I know she could just decide it’s worth it to screw her over to save herself.” She sighed, before giving her partner an annoyed glance. “And she’s my sister, not my rival. Would you quit it with that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am merely acknowledging the rivalry that you have chosen to allow to fall by the wayside–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s missing an eye, Arval. And I don’t care about some stupid kiddy rivalry at this point. She’s my sister, I’m not about to pull some competitive bullshit while she’s hurt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Very well," Arval muttered, dropping the subject for now. He still kept in mind the obvious weak point the Fell Star now had. "Also you're starting to go the wrong direction, take a left here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks," Shez said, following the directions as she made her way to the battlefield. And soon enough, she found herself there, and spotted Emily! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Who was chowing down on a bag of sweet buns. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Um, Em?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said something in response, sounding exasperated even as her mouth was stuffed full of food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…uh, what was that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mmgf–“ Emily swallowed, glaring at Shez. “I said I’m eating, idiot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I noticed. Why do you have a bunch of sweet buns?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because they taste good,” she stated in a tone that said she thought Shez was incredibly stupid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Well…yeah, I guess that’s a good reason.” Shez scratched her head. “So…what’s going on? Why’d you disappear all of a sudden?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The professor didn’t tell you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh? What would Manuela tell me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not her, dumbass. Your sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “Uh…what would Byleth tell me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That I’m an Agarthan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…hang on, what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emily huffed. “Right, guess I have to explain all of this…from the start, my real name is Kronya, I’m an Agarthan assassin that was sent to infiltrate the monastery and keep an eye on Edelgard, and none of those plans worked out at all so now I’m here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What??" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh…" Standing up as she set her bag of buns down, Emily straightened up. A moment passed before a pulse of dark magic surrounded her, putting Shez on her guard. Said guard dropped as she watched the magic fade and where Emily once stood was the pale face of Kronya the Agarthan. "Believe me now?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez had never been more confused in her life. Not only was her friend not the person she knew, but she was also an infiltrator. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It really doesn't help that she looks really hot– Wait. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Pulling out her sword, she took a step back. "...so you're working for Bias?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. Not at this point anyway. She had some…big dumb plan to try to kill the professor at the Goddess Tower, but..I don’t know how she did it, but I guess Professor Byleth figured it out ahead of time and stopped her…” Kronya sighed, brushing hand through her hair. “...it’s the dumbest thing. Just…your sister said she was happy I was alive. So…yeah. I’ve been lying to you the whole time, I probably would’ve killed someone you cared about if things had gone differently, and…and yeah. I’m sorry. I liked spending time with you. Do you have any questions?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez had several questions, but one came to mind. "Is Edelgard working with Bias?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If she was, she wouldn't have stonewalled me when I was in her class." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Well, I guess that’s one good thing about her…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? What’s that mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…nothing. I just learned she was lying to me and…and you were also lying to me, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah. So…here I am. Coming clean.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez sighed, scratching her head. “...so. Kronya, huh? Guess I can’t call you ‘Em’ anymore. Hm…hey, what about Kro? Or Kron? Or…Nya?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez. Shut up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, alright, I’m just…I’m not sure how to take this. You’re Agarthan, you’re not Emily, you’re...you’re someone completely different. And I don’t know anything about you.” She sighed again, then a thought occurred. “Hey, do you know anything about my mom?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? That Periander lady?" Kronya asked, frowning in thought, "The name doesn't sound familiar, but…well, she was either a caretaker or a scientist if she took you when you were a baby. I…I wasn't…they only told me what I needed to know. Unless the sages decided to 'grace' us with their presence, I only ever interacted with the instructor. So I don't know anything."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...How’s that work? The whole…everything, I guess,” Shez asked, trying to find the words, “...What are our people like?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Compared to the people up here? Terrible. I told some of this to the professor, but we have castes. Oratores, bellatores, laboratores. Basically nobles, knights, and commoners, now that I’m thinking about it, but…it’s still different. Oratores is supposed to be the caste of the scientists, alchemists, arcanists, whatever, and I’m a Bellator, so a warrior. Well, a Duellator if you want to be specific–Look it’s a lot of stupid classification stuff and technically I’d be a Dolofonos if I hadn’t killed my instructor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez blinked. “Okay, I…didn’t get a lot of that, but what was that about killing your instructor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh…so, okay, you see this?” She gestured at herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yes? I see you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s me, but it isn’t me. It’s…the flesh I wear, essentially, and the moment I came into awareness, I didn’t look like this. I wasn’t…born the same way your sister was or the same way Fodlaners are. I was made. Constructed and then implanted into a body that would let me operate the way I need to. And from moment one, I was designed to be a killer. I didn’t get a mom, I got an instructor, and the instructors aren’t meant to take care of us. Caretakers are meant to educate Oratores, instructors are meant to break Bellatores. Either we get beaten into proper warriors or we get called defective and disposed of. And I didn’t want to break, so I carved the bastard open and got to be called an elite because of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s why I have these,” she explained, gesturing to the tails behind her that she rose up to show Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...wait, what? I thought those were ribbons, what the…you have tails??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I have tails. Like I said, I’m an elite. So…yeah, that’s my life story.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Wait, no, that was just the beginning part, you didn’t explain everything! And what about those lab guys, huh? What’s their thing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re laborers. Servants. They’re not meant for anything besides doing the menial work.” Kronya looked away. "They're supposed to be lesser. Bugs among the 'humans'. It wouldn't even matter if we decided to stab one in the throat if they angered us. Ha, no wonder so many traitors came from them…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Traitors?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“People who left Shambhala. Our home city. It’s underground. Dark, cramped, and terrible,” Kronya explained, bitterness leaking into her voice, "They make us think it's so important yet one of the things they reward us is being able to go out and see the sun." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...man, our people suck, huh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Been figuring that out, yeah. Though you probably would have gotten lucky if you stayed. Pretty sure they were designing you to be a sage." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, all those weird powers you have are something special. Magic tied to a legendary figure for our people, the great sage Epimenides.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Oh, right, that’s the person that Solon guy was talking about…so…my powers are his powers?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think so. Whatever you have, it's way more powerful and versatile than any elites I've seen. So who knows? If things had been different, you might have ended up being my boss." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...huh. Not sure if that would have been nice. Like, I like hanging around you, but everything else sounds like it sucks." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, it does, and that’s why I’m getting away from it. Now I just have to figure out what to do next." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...well, hey, maybe you could go to Leicester? Maybe become a mercenary?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya gave her a bewildered look. “That…wait, huh…that might not be a bad idea…that prick Myson is trying to cause problems in Adrestia and that bitch Cleobulus is in Faerghus, so Leicester might not be a bad place to hide out…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, see? And hey, once I’m out of here, I can meet up with you!” Shez decided, grinning, “You can join up with our mercenary company!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, or maybe I’ll make my own group and be way better than yours, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez smirked. “Oh really? You’re gonna try to compete with us? Because I know I could kick your ass!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah right, you’ve never fought me for real. I was always holding back!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well so I was I! I’d kick your ass if I went all out!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pff, prove it! Here and now!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine, I will!” Shez shouted, before the two charged at one another, fists flying as they fought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval, floating nearby, let out a sigh as the two girls faced off against one another. “I have a truly ridiculous vessel…Well, at least she has a friend to be stupid with,” Arval murmured, before settling in to watch the fight. Despite the annoyance he felt at the absurdity, watching the pair did feel…nostalgic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dwelling in memories was rarely comforting for him, but, for the moment, he sat back and watched, remembering sunny days long, long ago.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Sometime later, both Shez and Kronya laid out on the ground, bruised and panting heavily after their brawl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You suck at punching." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm better at stabbing." Pushing herself up, Kronya wiped some of the blood trickling down her forehead. "Did you have to bite me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If the option is there, I'm going for it!" Shez said as she laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Feh. Shut up," Kronya huffed, looking away from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh…so, you're leaving now?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. It’s best that I don't stick around for long." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right…then take care. I guess I'll just…stick around and figure out what to do for By." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You do that. And…make sure to let everyone know that knowing them wasn't…the worst," Kronya said, actually feeling embarrassed, "And tell Lysithea good luck with her family stuff." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pft, aw you do care~!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shut up or I'll make you!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't know if you can, pretty sure I won–" Was about as far as Shez got before Kronya grabbed her collar and pulled her in, cutting her off with a kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As her brain stopped working for a few moments, she almost fell to the ground when Kronya pushed her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, I'd almost say you're cute now," Kronya commented before she took off, leaving Shez behind as her brain started back up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Bwuh???" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arval, meanwhile, decided to helpfully chime in. "You're a disaster, you know that right?" </span>

  <p>“Heeeeeeey, Byleth…I brought cake,” Shez began, peeking into the infirmary, “And, uh, I wanted to say I’m sorry about the Edelgard thing…I know I got really mad there and I feel bad about yelling, so…yeah. But hey, listen, if you want me to, I’m totally up to kidnap Edelgard so you can see her sooner.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hold on, what happened with Edie?” Dorothea asked, peeking through the curtains around Byleth’s bed and earning a blink from Shez.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, uh…hey Dorothea? What’re you doing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Helping Byleth get dressed.”</p><p> </p><p>“...oh.”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s helping me change my bandages,” Byleth called out, earning a pout from Dorothea.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, she would’ve bought it…now, what was that about Edie?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez grimaced, before moving over with the plate of cake in hand. “Well…uh…how much do you know about…everything, I guess?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a big question, Shezzie. What does ‘everything’ mean in this context?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…okay, it’s weird to actually explain this because there’s a lot going on and I guess I’m not as mad now? Because it kind of feels hypocritical to be mad since…ah, maybe I shouldn’t say? It might mess things up...” She frowned as she handed the cake over to Byleth. “Hm…basically, I don’t like Edelgard now.”</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea raised an eyebrow. “That’s not really an explanation at all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, I know. It’s like…” She glanced at Byleth, who wasn’t paying attention at all in favor of having some cake. So there would be no help there. “...Edelgard was keeping some secrets, but so was Emily, and those secrets are kind of related so now I don’t know if I should say anything in case it makes things weird and causes problems.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm, so Edie has a secret that has to do with Emily…I wonder if that was the thing she wanted to talk about at the Goddess Tower?" </p><p> </p><p>"...seriously? She was going to tell you too?" Shez paused, glancing at her sister. “...hang on, is there something going on between the three of you?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused in the middle of her dessert, glancing up at Dorothea, who gave Shez a little grin. “There might be~ Ah, professor, you wouldn’t mind if I talk to Shezzie, would you?”</p><p> </p><p>The professor blinked, her mouth full of cake. “Er–”</p><p> </p><p>“Great! Come on Shezzie.” And Shez found herself promptly pulled from the infirmary as Dorothea grinned at her. “So, I’m going to be blunt for a moment. I like both Edie and Byleth, more than I’ve ever liked anyone before, and I would like to be with both of them, if possible. And, well, I might be nudging a few things to make it possible, if you catch my meaning.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez stared at the songstress. “...um…alright, I…don’t want to talk about my sister’s love life.”</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, why not?” She pouted. “We’re going to be in-laws, aren’t we?”</p><p> </p><p>“...uh…okay, um…hm.  I…didn’t know that was going on. And now I feel weird that you’re trying to seduce my sister into a harem with Edelgard.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. You make it sound dirty when you describe it like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not trying to, I just…I’m confused? And…concerned, a little, because of the stuff with Edelgard that I’m still trying to figure out if I should say or if Byleth should say or…whatever. I…I do think you’d probably be good for By, and I gotta admit I like you better than Edelgard, but I didn’t realize you wanted a thing with both of them? Like, I knew you liked Byleth, and I knew Edelgard really liked Byleth, but now I feel weird about Edelgard, and…yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>"Hm…Well, would it help if I admit it was only recently that I tried going for both of them? Prior to the mission at the Locket, I was pretty much willing to give up on both because I thought they'd be happier with each other."</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, huh…hm.” She had a lot of thoughts right now and decided to default to her first idea. “So…do <em> you </em> want me to kidnap Edelgard?”</p><p> </p><p>“Shez, I don’t want you to be banned from the entire country of Adrestia. That would make my wedding plans very awkward.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, sorry. Hm. I think I’m gonna need to think about stuff more, but…uh…I mean, as long as you’re good to Byleth, I think I’m okay with you." </p><p> </p><p>"Well I'm glad to hear that. I hope I can live up to your expectations,” she said with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>"...heh. I’m sure you can. Just…make sure to take it easy with By okay? She's not doing great right now, especially since Edelgard apparently confessed her feelings before everything happened…" </p><p> </p><p>"She did?" Dorothea asked, actually sounding surprised. "Didn't think Edie would actually have it in her…" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah she's definitely full of surprises," Shez muttered, before shaking her head. "Anyways, I'm going to figure out something else to do while you hang out with By. See you later." </p><p> </p><p>"See you," Dorothea said, waving her off, before turning back towards the nurse's room. With a quick breath, she adjusted her uniform slightly, before walking back in. "Sorry about that, professor~!" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, did Shez leave?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, she had some things to figure out. How are you feeling, by the way?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…" Byleth set her fork down, glancing away from Dorothea as she actually felt a bit nervous. "Doing okay." </p><p> </p><p>"Glad to hear, professor. Oh, would you like me to bring some tea later?" </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe? It might be nice." </p><p> </p><p>"Will do. Though before then I think it would be best if we talked about something important." </p><p> </p><p>"...What exactly is that?" </p><p> </p><p>"You, Edie, and me of course~" Dorothea said with a grin. "I mean, I heard she confessed her feelings to you~" </p><p> </p><p>"...Sorry." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? And what are you apologizing for?" </p><p> </p><p>"I…I wanted to help you two get together, and somehow I got Edelgard to fall for me." </p><p> </p><p>"Come now professor, I know you're not the most experienced, but it should be obvious Edelgard was crushing on you for far longer than you tried pushing us together." </p><p> </p><p>"...oh." Byleth felt her face get warm again. "I, um…didn't know that…since when?" </p><p> </p><p>"Around that time we all went out to town together. At least, that's when I noticed it anyway." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…that…that's long ago." </p><p> </p><p>"It is. So I'm glad to hear some progress was actually made~" </p><p> </p><p>"H-Hm…if you say so. I…I don't know if I feel the same way. I don't really…understand romance. I've never felt like that to anyone before, so I don't know if I feel like that to Edelgard," Byleth said, as she took a breath to steady herself. "And…well, I never really thought of myself as pretty before, but now with this scar…" </p><p> </p><p>“Haven’t you heard, Byleth? It’s common knowledge that women love scars~” Dorothea teased, smiling at the professor in a way that made her face warm. She sat on the bed, her smile taking on a more understanding tinge. “I do understand why you’re worried though. For a diva, her beauty is her life. If you wind up scarred because some noble decides he doesn’t like how you spoke to him…well, you can’t exactly go on stage from then on, now can you? Though I think you could pull off quite the distinguished look with an eyepatch~.</p><p> </p><p>“Teasing aside though…You’ve always been pretty, professor, and I know I don’t mind how you look now. And you can’t tell me Edie would have any aversion to someone with scars. We all have them, after all, even if they’re not immediately visible. Yours is just a little more noticeable." Dorothea reached down to the hem of her shirt, before pulling it up slightly, revealing the edge of a scar at her waist, faded but still slightly noticeable. "A drunk noble threw a broken bottle at me a few weeks before Manuela found me. I'm just lucky it didn't hit my face."</p><p> </p><p>“...Hm. You didn’t deserve that.”</p><p> </p><p>“People don’t deserve most things that happen to them. The world isn’t fair, but that much should be obvious to anyone that made it to adulthood. Anyone that thinks it is has something wrong with them…but, as I said, things could have been worse. It’s easy to conceal, with clothes or cosmetics, and I can still look perfect for the people that want me to pretend I am. You, on the other hand…I bet you could really pull off the fierce mercenary look if you wanted,” she remarked, brushing Byleth’s cheek beneath her wound, “And who knows? It could heal up nicely enough that with a glass eye, no one would even notice.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I don’t know if I want to look like a fierce mercenary,” Byleth murmured, “I…Maybe I just want to be a cute professor…”</p><p> </p><p>"Well in that case you're already doing great~" Dorothea teased, getting Byleth to blush. </p><p> </p><p>"Th-Thanks…I…I still don't know what romantic love feels like, so I don't even know if I can love Edelgard like that." </p><p> </p><p>"Aw come on professor, surely thinking about her makes your heart beat faster~" </p><p> </p><p>"My heart doesn't beat." </p><p> </p><p>"Doing that joke again professor?" Dorothea asked with a frown. </p><p> </p><p>"It's not a joke. My heart doesn't beat. It's never beaten," Byleth said, staring down at her lap. "I…I don't know what exactly happened, maybe a mix of my crest, and how I was stillborn but…that's just how I am." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Dorothea seemed lost for words, so Byleth continued. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't really read romance often but, whenever I do, there's always a focus in the heart. How it beats faster or goes out of control when someone is in love. And…well how am I supposed to feel that?" Byleth asked as her chest felt tight. </p><p> </p><p>"...Professor, is it okay if I call you Bylie?" </p><p> </p><p>"Huh? Oh, okay, sure," Byleth said, a bit confused by the non-sequitur, though she did like the nickname. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, Bylie, what do you think about Edie and I getting together, without you." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth felt her chest get tighter. "...H-Happy. You two would be happy, so I would be as well." </p><p> </p><p>"Really? So you wouldn't feel sad at all?" Dorothea asked. "Because if I was in that situation, I'd feel sad. Even if Edie loved me and only me, I'd feel sad knowing I left you out." </p><p> </p><p>"I don't…I wish I could feel emotions better so I could answer you. It's… it's uncomfortable not being able to feel things other people do. Shez has always teased me about who I like and such, but… I really don't know if I like anyone like that. I know dad loved mom, Shez is… attracted enough to people to flirt with them. Practically everyone I know is into someone else and I… I want to feel what they feel. I want to be able to experience every emotion everyone else does…" </p><p> </p><p>"Then, would you like my help?" Dorothea asked, smiling down at her. "Because I love you too, Byleth." </p><p> </p><p>"...Wh-What?" </p><p> </p><p>"I said what I said, Bylie. How was I not supposed to fall in love with how you’ve been this entire year? Really, I wouldn't be surprised if everyone had a small crush on you." </p><p> </p><p>"H-Huh? I, um…I just…I don't know…" Byleth frowned. "You don't need to include me. I don't know if I can love you two like you deserve."</p><p> </p><p>"Heh, that's okay Bylie. I don't even know if Edelgard actually likes me or not, but I'm okay with that. I'm okay with just being a pretty face in the background of her life, so long as I can live a comfortable life." </p><p> </p><p>“...You should have someone you love,” Byleth said, still frowning, “You deserve to be happy, Dorothea.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you don’t think Edie would make me happy? I could have sworn you were trying to push us together.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth’s frown turned a little awkward. “I thought…You two seemed to like each other. I thought you would be happy together.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the thing, Bylie. I do like Edie, and I’m pretty sure she likes me too, I just don’t know if it’s in the same way as she likes you. Honestly speaking, I had resigned myself to marrying someone who just wanted a beautiful trophy for a wife if I couldn’t find anything better, so being the second wife to an emperor is far better than I ever thought I could get. And the funny thing is, I think Edie would do her very best to care for me and make me happy. She'd probably shower me with gifts to make me feel loved, even if she doesn't love me. Even if she does do away with the nobility, she'd likely make sure we'd want for nothing." She smiled sadly again. "Who knows, maybe one day she'll love me like you, or maybe she won't. Either way, I'll be okay with that." </p><p> </p><p>“...Will you?” Byleth asked, genuine concern leaking into her voice, “Dorothea, I want you to be happy. I care about you. Not just as my student, you’re my friend.”</p><p> </p><p>“Heh…And what if I wanted to be more than friends?” Dorothea reached across the bed and put her hand on Byleth’s, smiling at her.</p><p> </p><p>And Byleth felt her face warm up again. “...I-I…" Despite herself, she couldn't help but focus on how her hand felt…moving her hand, she gently grabbed Dorothea's. As their fingers intertwined, Byleth couldn't help but note how soft it felt, even with the calluses that were beginning to form. She wondered if this moment could last forever.</p><p> </p><p>Her chest didn't feel tight anymore. "...Your hand feels nice." </p><p> </p><p>“So does yours,” she replied, before leaning closer, “Bylie, can I kiss you?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth’s eyes widened. For a moment, a strange moment, she thought she felt…something in her chest, before her mouth moved. “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>And then their lips were together and Byleth felt as if time had stopped. </p><p> </p><p>Feeling Dorothea pull away, Byleth could only stare up at her as the songstress smiled. "Heh, here's hoping Edie doesn't mind that I took the lead~" With a smile, Dorothea walked away, leaving Byleth alone as she now had several thoughts to deal with. </p><p> </p><p>A small thump sounded out in the room as Byleth fell back in her bed, staring up at the ceiling. </p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, did you finally realize some things?" Sothis asked as she floated above her. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth did. She realized many things. She also knew that…regardless of how things went moving forward, no matter what happened with Edelgard once she talked with her…she was in love with the two of them. </p><p> </p><p>Her chest felt tight, but it didn't feel bad this time. </p><hr /><p>Rhea could remember few moments in her long, long life where she felt as genuinely enraged as she did after hearing what happened on the night of the ball. A second Agarthan had infiltrated the monastery, her sanctuary, while disguised as one of her faithful. A second infiltrator, right under her nose, who not only had the temerity to steal her way into the one place in the world that should have been safe, but the audacity to outright <em> mutilate </em> her mother’s vessel.</p><p> </p><p>If she had that wretched creature in front of her, she would gouge the Agarthan’s eyes out with her bare hands.</p><p> </p><p>As it was, however, the Archbishop should remain calm in times of crisis. So Rhea remained calm. Outwardly, at least.</p><p> </p><p>"We've already begun to question the staff and clergy to see if any other infiltrators are among them. Captain Jeralt is being very thorough when it comes to questioning," Seteth stated as he read a report. "And based on what we've found at the old ruins, it seems the infiltrator only had plans to unleash demonic beasts, as there were no signs of anything else hidden there." </p><p> </p><p>"Have the knights double check. We have to be absolutely certain she didn't leave anything else behind," Rhea ordered, doing her best to keep her tone even. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course. As for what else there is to speak about, Professor Eisner is ready to deliver her report." </p><p> </p><p>"Manuela is letting her move about?" </p><p> </p><p>"Only to make her report at the professor's insistence," Seteth answered, lowering his report, "She is to return to bed afterwards." </p><p> </p><p>"...yes, that would be good, she needs it," Rhea muttered as Seteth moved to open the door, letting her mother in. </p><p> </p><p>"Hello there, Seteth, Lady Rhea, I'm sorry for worrying you," her mother said, bowing before the two. </p><p> </p><p>"There is no need to apologize. The fact that you are well and alive is far more important," Seteth said, nodding to her with a small smile. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, now, I do believe you have a report for us?" Rhea asked, a little impatience leaking into her voice. </p><p> </p><p>"That I do. On the day of the ball, I had gone to the cathedral to check on the confession box, as I was worried that the students may be nervous for the upcoming ball. As I was there, I noticed that the librarian named Selene had exited the goddess tower,” Byleth started, recalling the events of that fateful day and lying through her teeth. "I was aware that normally people are not allowed up there, so I wanted to ask what she was doing, but then I noticed that she seemed to be moving suspiciously. For fear of losing track of her, I did not move to inform anyone and followed her.</p><p> </p><p>“After following her, I discovered that she was attempting to unleash a hoard of demonic beasts upon the students. Sadly, she managed to discover me and unleashed them early," Mother explained before reaching up to her bandages, "I was injured in the process, but I was able to wound her as well. I believe she managed to escape, but those are not wounds she'll be able to ignore." </p><p> </p><p>It wasn't enough. She deserved to suffer far more for her crimes.  </p><p> </p><p>"I see…did she say anything about her motives?" Seteth asked as Rhea remained silent. </p><p> </p><p>"She…she told me she wanted to hurt me because I apparently killed someone close to her. So she was going to harm the students to get to me." </p><p> </p><p>"That is troubling to hear…" </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know what exactly she's planning, but I doubt she'll give up easily." </p><p> </p><p>"She likely won't," Rhea agreed, letting out a small breath. "For now, it's best if you rest and recover. You can also tell your students they won't need to assist in any mission this month. With you injured, and the house leader leaving, I doubt it will be a good time for them to potentially get into combat." </p><p> </p><p>"Very well, Lady Rhea." </p><p> </p><p>"Now then, is there anything else you wish to say before you leave?" Seteth asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, well…there is one more thing I wish to say. I wish to thank you for this opportunity that you've given me, but I think I shall retire from the position of professor at the end of the year." Rhea's eyes widened as she stared at her mother’s vessel. "Emperor Edelgard offered me a position as her advisor, and I think it might be a better fit for me, especially given my injury." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, well, I suppose we cannot fault you for such a decision. This year has been rather…tumultuous." Sighing, Seteth shook his head. "I suppose we should be thankful that you gave us advance notice rather than simply quitting at the end of the year."</p><p> </p><p>"I figured it would only be appropriate to mention it sooner rather than later–"</p><p> </p><p>"W-Wait, are you sure you want to go?" Rhea called out, getting her mother to look at her in surprise, though it faded into a look of understanding.</p><p> </p><p>"It's something I've been thinking about for some time but…yes, it's what I want." She smiled up at the archbishop. "I also want to thank you. I…I know I was curt at the beginning of the year but…I'm happy to have been a professor here. I got to meet so many people I care about now. I…I'm glad to have met you Lady Rhea, and I'm happy my mama knew you as well."  </p><p> </p><p>Rhea paused, the words settling in her mind in a strange way as she stared at Byleth. It…felt nice to hear that, but it didn’t change things. Byleth was her mother’s vessel–She was her mother. She just…didn’t know it yet. </p><p> </p><p>In that sense, it was almost understandable.</p><p> </p><p>At the same time, it wasn’t. The monastery should feel like home to her. Rhea had built Garreg Mach to be a new home, a new Zanado. Her mother should feel content here. Why would she ever want to go anywhere else?</p><p> </p><p>For a brief moment, she felt a flash of anger towards the princess for daring to steal–But, no, that was foolish. She was being foolish, letting her emotions out of control like this. She had to think things through…</p><p> </p><p>“I…I understand, professor. As Seteth said, thank you for giving us this notice ahead of time. Furthermore, due to the severity of your recent injury, I think it would be best if your class refrained from going on combat missions for the rest of the year. Perhaps, instead, some training exercises with the Knights of Seiros would be best?” And it would keep her here, at the monastery, where no one else could take her.</p><p> </p><p>"That's very kind of you, Lady Rhea. I was hoping to start training soon so I can get accustomed to my change in depth perception," the child before her said, a smile on her face. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, and if you wish, I can assist in your training,” Rhea offered, keeping her face even, “Though I may not appear as such, I am quite skilled with the blade and in hand-to-hand." </p><p> </p><p>"Really? Well, I suppose that makes sense. You are the leader of the church, it's to be expected that you can defend yourself," she agreed, as though it was completely expected that a major religious figure would be capable of brawling.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course I can. Do you wish to begin your training right now?" Rhea asked, before Seteth cleared his throat. </p><p> </p><p>"Professor Eisner still needs to rest, Lady Rhea," Seteth said, before turning to the child. "Apologies for Lady Rhea’s forwardness. I believe she may simply wish to make most of your remaining time here. It is my understanding that your mother and her were close." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yes, she was the midwife for my birth actually. It's…odd to think, if mama had survived and we had stayed, I might have actually considered you an aunt, Lady Rhea." </p><p> </p><p>“...I…I would not mind, child, if you chose to consider me family,” she spoke carefully, trying to hide the welling of emotion that came with those words. The irony of Byleth’s kindly meant offer sat sourly in her heart and for a moment, Rhea wondered if she should simply order the child to be kept here, where she would be safe. She couldn’t let such a light in her life simply vanish, like so many others.</p><p> </p><p>"Well…in that case, thank you Aunty Rhea," the child said, a large smile on her face. </p><p> </p><p>…She would give it time. Let her see that staying here was a far better option. And if she didn't…well, she was only one foolish child. Rhea could harden her heart to what needed to be done–</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…your birthday is coming up soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea paused, then glanced at Seteth, who had spoken up once Byleth left the room. “I beg your pardon?”</p><p> </p><p>“Your birthday, Lady Rhea. It should be on the eleventh along with Saint Seiros day, so perhaps it would be nice to do something to celebrate? Perhaps involving Professor Eisner and her family?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Ah…such as?”</p><p> </p><p>“Such as a dinner, perhaps? After all, while I could tell you felt some awkwardness there, it was clear you appreciated young Byleth’s interest in accepting you as family,” Seteth stated, looking oddly positive, “So I think it would be best for you to invite the Eisners to a birthday dinner with you. I can bring Flayn and we can let them know certain things about our familial connections.” He gave her a knowing look. “You cannot keep it a secret forever, Lady Rhea.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” <em> Oh goddess, he still thinks I am Byleth’s grandmother…No, wait, this is…good? Good. Familial ties are a good thing to emphasize. </em> “Yes, perhaps that is a better idea…”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you had an idea of your own?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I didn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“...ah…very well then, I’ll let them know as soon as possible.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea nodded, reconsidering matters. <em> So maybe less hardening my heart, more opening my heart? To an extent, of course, opening it too much opens me up for heartache. </em></p><p> </p><p>Yes, this was certainly a better plan.</p>

  <p>
  <span>Ferdinand von Aegir was, in many ways, something of an oblivious young man. He had his ideas about how the world worked that he tended to stick to, but he was aware enough to realize how different things were now that Edelgard had left the Academy. The red shoulder cape now affixed to his uniform was proof enough of that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not only that, but Professor Byleth now bore an eyepatch where her right eye once was, a mark of the battle she had gone through while the rest of them remained entirely oblivious to the danger in their midst. He knew it must hurt her more than it could hurt any of them, but he couldn't help but feel it as a mark of shame for not being there for her! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So he needed to think of something to do! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, perhaps it would be best if we acted as if nothing had changed?" Flayn suggested as the two had a brainstorming session. "I appreciated my brother's attempt to cheer me up after my kidnapping but...well, it was embarrassing having everyone get involved in a fishing tourney." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was? Truly? I thought it was a nice event to bring everyone together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was still embarrassing,” Flayn insisted, pouting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…but would Professor Byleth be embarrassed by such a thing? Perhaps we could put on a celebration of her accomplishments as a professor!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…maybe that would be a good idea. Especially given what my brother told me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? What did he say?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, well…don't tell anyone I said this but-" Pulling at his sleeve, Flayn had Ferdinand crouch down to whisper in his ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"WHAT!?" he shouted as Flayn tried to immediately shush him. "You can't be serious about the professor quitting!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"All I know is what my brother mentioned. Apparently she has her reasons, but he didn't tell me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You don't think she's quitting out of shame, do you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Why would she be ashamed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Think of it, she was gravely injured not only once but twice this year. Not to mention that not only were we unruly at the start of the year, a student who was a part of the Black Eagles fled the monastery entirely!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…I suppose that’s true…though I thought Emily left on a vengeance quest?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is what her note claimed, yes, but it doesn’t not change the fact that she left without notice! Add in how both Edelgard and Hubert have left, she's probably feeling down on herself!" Ferdinand stood up, looking determined. "We need to rally everyone together to cheer her up!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Well," Flayn frowned, wondering if they might be jumping to conclusions before thinking…if Byleth was her family, then it was her duty to make sure she was okay as her elder! "You're right, we need to bolster her spirits!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yes, this was the best plan!</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Aren't you two overreacting?" Claude asked as he stared up at Ferdinand and Flayn from the tea table he was hanging out at. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I mean, I haven't heard anything about this myself, as juicy as it sounds," Hilda muttered, as she picked up a macaroon to munch on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I think we're reacting as appropriately as we can!” Ferdinand affirmed, “I understand that I may have only become house leader, but I would have hoped you'd take me seriously!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I am," Claude lied as leaned back in his chair, "But you know how Teach is. She's quiet but she's not the type to just quit. I mean if she was, she probably would have done so much earlier." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But what if she's just bottling it down!" Flayn argued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude sighed as he looked away from them, before pausing, "Hey, Shez, come over here!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blinking, Shez turned to the group, before walking over. "What's up?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can you tell these two to calm down and that Teach actually isn't sad?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, who told you she's sad?" Shez asked, sounding surprised. "Please don't tell me someone started gossiping, I really don't want By to cry again…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah ha! You see!” Ferdinand exclaimed, pointing at Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn, meanwhile, actually listened to what Shez was saying. “Oh no! Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that she really has been upset!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Which is all the more reason why we need a celebration of her efforts to raise her spirits!” Ferdinand declared, his positivity undaunted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, wait, is Teach actually planning on quitting?" Claude asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...okay, you guys have to actually tell me who's telling you this stuff," Shez replied in lieu of answering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, wow, I didn't think she was doing that bad…" Hilda muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well, she lost an eye. You don’t exactly walk that off.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah I can imagine the lack of depth perception would make that an issue,” Claude remarked, before pausing at the immediate glare Shez gave him, “Ah…sorry about that. Okay, so…as weird as it is to agree with the Empire’s loudest man and his new retainer, I gotta admit, it does sound like a good idea to cheer Teach up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s definitely not the loudest,” Shez interrupted, “That’s Caspar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He does tend to shout everything he says…” Flayn mused, before pausing. “Oh, am I Ferdinand’s retainer now? Oh I’ve never been a retainer before! Do I need to swear fealty now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably. Anyways, so would the Empire’s noblest noble work?” Claude asked, turning his attention from Flayn to Shez, who tilted her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think Constance would try to argue that, but she’s also not a noble right now, so I think Ferdinand wins by default.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would win such a title either way,” Ferdinand insisted, nodding, “Really, I would put myself in the running for the title of Fodlan’s noblest noble–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but we’re not trying to start a fight with Lorenz, so we’re being specific,” Claude stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, I wonder who the Kingdom’s noblest noble would be then…” Flayn mused, looking thoughtful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Doesn’t Annette win that by default?” Hilda suggested, “When her competition includes Sylvain and Felix, she's definitely in the lead. Honestly, the only one who would be stiff competition is maybe Ingrid." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, yes, while I might have been wrong about my assumptions of the kingdom and its people, I will admit that their more…knightly values means they aren't a paragon of nobility like Lorenz or I," Ferdinand muttered before pausing, "Oh, I really should apologize to Dimitri for how I was." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Apologize for what?" Dimitri asked, as he and Dedue walked over having heard his name. "Is something going on?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Teach is depressed and wants to quit," Claude said, speaking up before anyone else could. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What!?" Dimitri exclaimed, taken aback by that revelation. "We need to do something!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Which is what we're trying to figure out," Hilda responded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, to start we need to bring in everyone, but keep this a secret from the professor! It would be horrid if our plan was revealed before we could pull it off," Ferdinand said, starting the plan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…I could attempt to cook a meal with some of our classmates, if that is okay?" Dedue suggested. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh that sounds great, I want to help!" Flayn said, a large smile on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Those in the group who were familiar with Flayn’s cooking abilities blanched at the suggestion, though Ferdinand kept his composure as he spoke up quickly. “While I am sure the professor would appreciate your kind offer, Flayn, I am afraid I will need your aid in planning the event properly! You are to be my assistant, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh of course! I shall gladly aid you in whatever you might need!” she replied, successfully deflected, “What should we decide on first?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…well the most sensible thing to begin with is likely–” Ferdinand began, heading over to a nearby table and pretty much ignoring the rest of the group in the process as he and Flayn began making plans.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, so where is the professor anyway?” Hilda spoke up, “She’s not still in bed, is she?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s…a good question,” Shez noted, frowning, “I know Professor Manuela said she’s okay to move around now, so I figure she’s gotta be doing something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then we’ll have to split up,” Dimitri decided, “Each of us can investigate a location Professor Byleth prefers to spend her time at. I believe she most commonly spends her leisure time at the fishing pond?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, usually. That or the greenhouse…or the mess hall?” Shez tilted her head and crossed her arms, thinking. “Those are all over the place though, huh? Might take a while for us to check all of them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...aren’t they all in the same corner of the monastery?” Hilda asked, prompting a blink from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are they? No, the mess hall is by the dorms and the pond is by the town.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Those are right next to each other…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where do you think the greenhouse is?” Claude asked, his eyebrow raised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm. That’s a good question. Well the greenhouse has plants, so…somewhere by the forest?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, so, we need someone to go with Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll volunteer for that then,” Dimitri decided.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? You're still trying to steal our merc back, prince?” Claude asked with an amused grin, “You know, crawling back to a girl that’s already left you isn’t a great look.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have to pay for dates, Claude,” Shez retorted, “You don’t have any room to talk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...yeah, I’m not going to argue with that. Just make sure she’s home before dinner, alright Dimitri?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...we're not planning on leaving the monastery," Dimitri muttered, before he shook his head, "Regardless, Dedue, if you can please start on the meal that would be wonderful, I'll make sure to point Mercedes and Annette your way if I see them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, your highness," Dedue responded, bowing before he left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, guess that means we should start looking. Make sure to tell everyone the plan, but keep it a secret, got it?" Claude said, before he and Hilda went off towards the mess hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Understood. We will keep the utmost secrecy–And he left already, hm.” Dimitri sighed at his fellow house leader’s lack of respect for his words, before glancing at Shez. “So, where would you like to look first?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Uh…well the mess hall would make sense, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Claude and Hilda are going there right now. As is Dedue, I suppose, though I believe his intentions are to head for the kitchen–It doesn’t matter, we should just look somewhere else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, alright. Guess we should check out the greenhouse then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Why don’t we head in the other direction? Perhaps towards the cathedral?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would she be there? No, wait, she answers the advice box, she probably would be there.” Shez said, before nodding to herself. "Let's go!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let's," Dimitri agreed, as the two walked together. "Ah, do you mind if I ask how you're doing? I understand that what happened might have affected the professor more, but I want to make sure you're okay as well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Well, I'm mostly feeling awful. Like there I was having fun and she was almost dying." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I can understand where you're coming from. Though we were not as close as you and the professor, I can't deny how much sorrow I felt when I heard my stepsister and her siblings had been allegedly affected by a plague." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, sorry to hear that…wait, you have a sister?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Only through marriage and…well, I suppose since I finally reconnected with her, it's okay to talk about. Edelgard is actually my step-sister after her mother married my father."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. She looked up at Dimitri trying to parse those words for a moment before she pressed a hand against her face and groaned. “Great. So not only did I screw up with her, but now you’re gonna hate me too…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Why would I hate you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just…so the part about Byleth being sad and me not wanting to make her sad was because of a whole thing where I got mad at Edelgard and…ugh, this is hard to explain. I mean, I think I was crying more than Byleth–Whatever! The point is I was mean to Edelgard, and since you’re Edelgard’s brother, you’re basically obligated to be mad at me now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'm sorry, I'm a bit confused. What exactly did Edelgard do?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's a long story and one I probably shouldn't tell since I'll mess it up. The important part is that Byleth is apparently okay with it, and may or may not be in love with Edelgard."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah it's an entire thing. Edelgard confessed to her and now Byleth isn't sure if she feels the same way or not. I think. Maybe. I brought her cake, I think that means we’re good, but I've been giving her space since then." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Well, to begin, I don’t hate you, Shez. I actually wanted to check in with you. It’s why I volunteered to work with you in finding the professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “You want to check in on me? Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“While you may be a Deer now, you were a Lion previously, and I consider it my duty as both your house leader and your friend to make sure you are feeling better after everything that happened.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...huh. I…I guess I kind of appreciate that. I, uh…it wasn’t all bad, being part of the Lions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The fact that there were bad parts at all is more than enough reason to change classes,” Dimitri allowed, before giving her a slight smile, “I do wish, in hindsight, that you had decided to leave after the Battle of Eagle and Lion though. Perhaps we would have stood a better chance then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh for sure, you definitely would’ve won with me on your side,” Shez stated, nodding, before she paused, “Huh. Sounds like someone’s training.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” Dimitri gave her a glance, before pausing for a different reason. “…how in the world did we arrive at the training grounds?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez didn’t pay him any attention though, instead just heading into the training grounds and looking around curiously. Inside, the pair found Byleth and Rhea sparring, which came as a surprise for the two of them, especially when they saw the Archbishop, dressed in more practical yet still white garments instead of her usual gown, easily deflecting Byleth’s punches. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You might have trained to use more than your sight when it comes to sensing attacks, but you have to grow accustomed to this new change. Being unable to see is different then training to fight while blinded." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. I understand. Being half-blind is actually more of a hindrance because my remaining sight keeps tricking me,” Byleth noted, frowning at her loss of depth perception.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is one way to think of it. It will be difficult to compensate for, but I am certain you can get back to your previous level of skill with practice,” Rhea assured, smiling at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Uh, hey!” Shez called out, catching Byleth and Rhea’s attention, “What’s going on over here? Are you two training?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m in a fight to the death for the right to become archbishop,” Byleth replied, entirely deadpan, which earned a huff from Shez and a little laugh from Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Child, please, don’t joke about that sort of thing,” she requested while trying to stifle her giggles.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “Okay. But yeah, we’re training. I’m trying to compensate for my eye going missing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You say that like it wandered off on its own,” Dimitri commented, making Byleth pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hi Dimitri. Didn’t see you there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Dimitri wasn’t quite sure if that was intended as a joke or not. “Hello professor. Are you…feeling well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“About as well as I can be, yeah. Like I said, Rhea’s helping me get back into practice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I noticed. I admit, I’m somewhat surprised to see you training with the professor, Lady Rhea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why wouldn’t I?” the archbishop asked, “Professor Byleth was injured while protecting the monastery from another infiltrator, one I cannot help but feel responsible for not catching before she could cause such pain. Therefore, I wish to aid her in her recovery as best I can.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. That’s nice of you,” Shez commented, before glancing at her sister, “And you’re feeling alright, Byleth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“About as well as I can,” Byleth said, missing Dimitri’s grimace, “Though I was going to take a break since we’ve been training for some time. Oh, Shez, I was actually going to stop at the greenhouse, do you want to come with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure,” Shez readily agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, may I come along as well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Actually, Prince Dimitri,” Rhea interrupted, “I wished to speak with you about the upcoming mission, and whether your class might be willing to provide aid.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh…” Dimitri glanced at Byleth, concern evident before he schooled his features and nodded to the archbishop. “Of course, Lady Rhea.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you. It will be somewhat difficult to adjust to the changes with the Eagles, but I am certain we will be able to resolve this matter soon enough. You have all proven yourselves to be very capable,” Rhea praised as Shez and Byleth walked away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So…what are you getting at the greenhouse?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to check on my garden, and…well, I wanted to get some flowers.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, were you going to bring them to your room?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I just…wanted to get them for someone,” Byleth explained as they walked together. As they passed the dorms, Shez noticed Claude and Hilda by the pond, watching the two of them. Giving the two a sneaky thumbs up, she assured them everything was okay. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude and Hilda, meanwhile, wondered what Shez was going to do to blow their cover. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Wait, what's going on?" Dorothea asked, unsure of what she had just heard Ferdinand say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The professor is leaving the academy out of shame, we have to work together to make sure she doesn't!" the noblest of nobles declared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...are you sure you aren't overreacting?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, apparently Dimitri and Claude also think that. And there was something about Shez saying Byleth cried?" Caspar said, the rest of the Eagles having been gathered by the new house leader. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What?"  Dorothea felt as if she had missed a great deal while going shopping. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She is probably leaving because of my grotesque countenance…" Constance muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course not, Constance! You look great as always!" Flayn declared, before looking at the songstress. "We've already informed everyone! The Lions are helping in the kitchen, while the Deer are keeping an eye on the professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, informed them of what?” Dorothea asked, trying to get at least some information here.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The party, of course!” Ferdinand answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...no one mentioned a party,” Hapi pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We didn’t? No, I’m sure we did…though, did we inform you, specifically?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you told everyone except your own classmates,” Linhardt noted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…well we've been busy planning everything, so it slipped our minds," Ferdinand said, trying to excuse himself. "Regardless, we must ensure everything goes well!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure. What’s the actual plan though?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that’s simple!” Flayn spoke up, “We are going to be hosting a party for Professor Byleth!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I got that part. What else?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…” She trailed off, then looked at Ferdinand, wondering if there was actually anything else to the plan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well we'd of course all speak about how much the professor means to us! I myself have already prepared a speech!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-W-We need to write speeches?!” Bernadetta squeaked, audibly terrified at the prospect.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, no, you do not necessarily–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hell yeah! I’m gonna win this speech competition easy!” Caspar declared with a big grin. "I'm gonna speak the best!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not if I am speaking the greatest!” Petra countered, giving Caspar a competitive grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Dorothea had a dawning realization that she had to be the responsible one now. "Okay, let's back up a minute, have any of you actually talked with the professor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Would that not ruin the surprise?" Petra asked in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But we can at least know if she’s leaving because she actually is sad or–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But what if asking just makes her feel worse!?" Bernadetta squeaked out in a panic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea sighed, before pausing when Marianne raised a hand. “Um…it might be better just to ask…we should make sure she’s actually okay with having a party.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Marianne, you’re the best,” Dorothea praised, happy to have someone else be responsible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"O-Oh, um…thank you…" Marianne managed to mutter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…well, seeing if she is up for a party would probably be a good idea," Ferdinand agreed with a thoughtful look, getting Dorothea to roll her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, I'll go check that," Dorothea muttered, before walking past her classmates, looking for Byleth. Which, well, was easy enough since she found a large crowd of Golden Deer near the reception hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm telling you this is pointless," Lysithea grumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You sure? Cause I want to make sure the professor is okay," Raphael said in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's not what I meant!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...So I’m guessing the professor is nearby?" Dorothea spoke up, catching their attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey Dorothea!” Raphael greeted, smiling cheerfully, “Yeah, Professor Byleth and Shez are over there, talking to Seteth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Glancing past the Deer, Dorothea could see the sisters standing by one another talking with Seteth, with Byleth holding a bouquet of flowers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why is she holding flowers?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't know, but it's a lovely bouquet," Ignatz said, before Lorenz sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Clearly she is bringing them to the graveyard for her mother."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That might be a big assumption but…well, that bunch of flowers does have the type that I see the captain take when he goes to the cemetery." Leonie muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right…well, good news is that all of you have been relieved of this duty, I need to talk with her so you guys can go," Dorothea said, before waving them off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You sure? Cause I'm totally fine with sticking around," Claude asked as he raised his hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you feel like letting Ferdinand prepare a massive speech, which means he will certainly expect you to prepare one too since you’re a house leader, go ahead." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Claude sighed, before gesturing for everyone to follow him. "Right. Come on guys, we got a speech to stop." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, we can't just leave the professor!" Lorenz argued before being shooed away by Dorothea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes you can now go," Dorothea said, sending the class off before heading into the hall and catching the end of the conversation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"–look forward to dinner together then," Seteth said before walking off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Making plans?" Dorothea asked, getting the two mercenaries to look at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Kinda? Apparently it's Rhea's birthday soon, so Seteth wanted to invite us over for dinner." Shez answered, getting Dorothea to blink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, that's a surprise." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Mhm, I would have thought Rhea would have invited me when we were sparring," Byleth mused, before glancing at Shez. "Ah, Shez, do you mind giving us some privacy?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You sure? I don't mind sticking around." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, please." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…well, make sure to call for me if you need anything!" Shez said, giving her best grin, before leaving the two alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, Bylie, how are you doing?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'd say good. Everyone's been treating me nicely so that's a good thing at least." Byleth said, a small smile on her face, before pausing. "Oh, um…I wanted to give this to you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Extending her hands out, the mercenary handed her the bouquet of flowers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh! Well, not that I dislike them, but what's the occasion?" Dorothea asked, looking at the beautiful flowers as she took them. White lilies, pink valerians, and red carnations all arranged together wonderfully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No reason. I um…just thought you might like them," Byleth said, scratching the back of her head. "I know you like lilies and Edelgard likes carnations but…I thought they might look good with some valerians. They were, um, my mom's favorite, apparently." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well that is very sweet of you, Bylie~" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm glad you like them," Byleth said, before clearing her throat. "I…I'm still new to this, but…I know I like being near you, and I want to keep being near you. So…when I go to Enbarr after I retire, I hope we can go see Edelgard together. So we can keep being…near each other…" Dorothea watched as Byleth began to blush slightly. "I'm really not good at this…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I think you're doing fantastic~" Dorothea said, leaning forward and giving Byleth a kiss on the cheek. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hm…thank you. Still, I want to be able to say this better…are there any poetry books you recommend?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Poetry?” She paused. “Bylie, are you planning to seduce me through poetry?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, that is exactly what I plan on doing. Do you have any recommendations?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...pft–hahaha!" Dorothea couldn't help herself from bursting into a fit of laughter. "Well, I'll admit I didn't expect you to be so blunt. Guess I'll do my best to find good poetry books for you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you, Dorothea," Byleth said, feeling her heart swell as the songstress smiled in return. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, oh, quick question, are you up for a party?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Does it have something to do with what the Deer were following me around for?" Byleth asked, getting Dorothea to blink. "I might have lost an eye, but I can still hear well enough. Not to mention they were being pretty loud." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. Well, yes, they do tend to be loud, and yes, they do want to throw a party. Specifically, Ferdie and Flayn want to throw a party to help cheer you up since they think you’re quitting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, well, I am planning on going to work for Edelgard. I'm not going to be quitting right now though." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah but you know how they overreact. Come on, let's go find a vase for these flowers, before we head over to the dining hall." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, let's," Byleth agreed, two walking off together. As they did, she felt fingers brush against her hand, before gently holding it. With a smile, she gently squeezed the hand in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though she only had a couple months left at the Academy, a part of her really did want these days to last forever. </span>

  <p>
  <span>Saint Seiros Day, possibly the most important day of the year, especially for the faithful of Fodlan. It was the day dedicated to the founder of the Church, and prophet of the goddess. However, for a certain person, there was something more important. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For Flayn, it was her Aunty Rhea’s birthday, and that meant she wanted to celebrate! And luckily for her, she and her brother wouldn't be the only ones to celebrate it! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So what kinda gifts do archbishops like?" Shez asked, glancing around the market with her sister and Flayn in tow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Holy stuff?" Byleth responded, tilting her head as she looked at a drawing of a crest of Seiros. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, good point…though what if she likes the opposite? Like, since she’s surrounded by holy stuff all the time, maybe she’d like something that’s completely different!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Or she surrounds herself with holy stuff because she likes it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…what would the opposite be though…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you listening to me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am, I’m just thinking about my own thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm.” Byleth decided to just leave Shez to that in favor of looking around the marketplace while considering what Rhea would probably like for a gift. There were those goddess statuettes, she would probably like those…or maybe a painting? A painting could be nice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, was thinking about what the opposite of church stuff would be. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Maybe something exotic? Would Rhea like foreign stuff? Hm, maybe I should ask around Abyss then, see if they have anything neat…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…What do you think, Flayn?" Byleth asked, gesturing at a picture of a lake. "This looks like it would be nice to have in her office. A nice relaxing painting to look at when she's stressed." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh! That's a lovely idea!" the green-haired girl said, smiling as she looked away from the stylish hairclip she’d been checking out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nice, I'll take this painting," Byleth said, looking at the merchant as she pulled out her coin pouch, before pausing as she saw a book of dessert recipes. "And this book, please." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hadn't gotten Edelgard a coronation gift yet, but maybe she'd like something handmade.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, maybe these?” Shez considered, picking up a bag of exotic spices.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, no, not those,” Flayn immediately interceded, “Lady Rhea can’t stand spicy foods.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, really?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, she also can't handle hot drinks and often has to wait for them to cool down," Flayn explained, hoping to guide Shez away from other such gifts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh…well, maybe she just hasn't had the right type of spicy food!" She should have known that would be a fool’s errand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Er…I don’t think…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe we could find a book on foreign lands?” Byleth offered, trying to turn her sister’s interest elsewhere.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…that would probably be a better option," Flayn admitted, nodding along. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you guys think so, okay," Shez said, shrugging as she put down the bag of spices. "Hm…this is trickier than I thought." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If nothing else, I'm sure she'd appreciate the thought behind the gift," Byleth reassured, taking the painting from the merchant who had wrapped it up in some paper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, sure, but I want her to appreciate more than just the thought, I want her to like the gift!” Shez insisted, “I just gotta come up with something cool…maybe I should make something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…like what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well…I kind of know how to carve things, so…oh, wait, just had an idea! You two keep doing your shopping, I’m gonna find some wood!” Shez declared before hurrying off, grinning at the brilliant idea she just had.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…should we be concerned?” Flayn asked, feeling strangely worried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably,” Byleth admitted, “I’ll get a back-up gift for her, just in case.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Rhea had to admit, she hadn’t expected much for her birthday. Few even knew that Saint Seiros Day was the date of her birth. The most she ever really received were “anonymous” presents sent by her cardinals, who really were too secretive for their own good sometimes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regardless, receiving an invitation from young Flayn to have dinner with “her family” was an unexpected yet sweet gesture, if one that sent a pang of loss through her heart as she couldn’t help but remember the days long lost where Mother had once hosted grand feasts for all her kin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…She would have those days back soon enough. She just needed to be patient.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Those were her thoughts as she made her way to the Star Terrace, where young Flayn claimed to have set up something special. Dining under the stars did feel like a nice suggestion, a good change from typically taking her meals in her office, though as she stepped out onto the terrace, she couldn’t help but feel her eyes widen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Happy birthday!” called out the three young women standing in front of the dining table set up on the terrace, with notably more enthusiasm from Shez and Flayn though Byleth still gave it her best. Staring at the three, Rhea slowly turned to look at Seteth and Jeralt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The former had a small smile on his face while the latter looked like he wanted to be barrel deep in mead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know, I gotta say, it's surprising to hear that you're Flayn’s aunt. Though this means that Seteth was lying to me when I asked if you two were related!" Shez stated, catching Rhea off guard again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It is an honorary title, and now is not the time," Seteth groaned, his smile turning into a frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Normally I'd disagree, but I won't right now, especially since the much more important thing about Rhea being our granny!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea suddenly felt like she wanted to be barrel deep as well. Still, she was the archbishop, and she was very practiced at polite smiles as a result. “Thank you, children. This is a very sweet gesture. Though, what was that about me being a…'granny', as you put it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You can blame me for that, if you wish." Rhea really did want to blame Seteth. "I know it might have been better if you told her yourself, but…well, I believed that with everything that occurred, it would be best just to take the plunge and divulge the truth of your relation to Byleth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea would always regard Seteth as a stalwart ally and companion, one who had proven himself time again to be one of the few people in the world she could consider a true friend. She also found herself mentally cursing him because damn it all, this was such an awkward conversation to have now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t lost on her that she was the one who told him that stupid lie to begin with, but still. “Well, while I suppose it is not exactly how I would have wished to convey this information, I suppose I must thank you for taking that step for me, Seteth, given how reluctant I was to take it for myself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And why were you that ‘reluctant’?” Jeralt spoke up, regarding her with an expression she wasn’t quite able to decipher. It seemed vaguely disgruntled though.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps that was a poor choice of words. I merely meant to say that…if I must admit it, I wasn’t sure how to explain, given the inevitable changes to our relationships there would be once I elaborated on my relation to Sitri.” It wasn’t completely a lie, so she could pretend it wasn’t an issue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I will admit that it would have been difficult at the start of the year, but I've gotten to know you, Lady Rhea," Byleth said, looking up at the archbishop, "My mama trusted you greatly, and, even if I didn't know her, it's because of you two that I'm here. Even if we weren't related, I would still think of you as family at this point." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Rhea didn't know what to say. There was a strange feeling inside of her, one that twisted within her as she stared at the scar the young woman had on her face and the patch covering where her eye once was. “...thank you for that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And that means you’re family to me too!” Shez declared with a big grin, prompting a huff from her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, we were having a moment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A moment that I am now a part of!” Shez stated as she hugged Byleth with one arm. "After all, as your big sister, it's important to have my approval as well!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"While I don't wish to interrupt, I will point out that the food will grow cold if we do not hurry." Seteth pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh right! Come on, I helped cook!" Shez said, guiding Rhea to one of the chairs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You did?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez is actually a really good cook," Byleth said, sitting down at the table, "Don't worry, I made sure she didn't make everything spicy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea grimaced on reflex, before smoothing out her expression. “Do you have a fondness for spicy foods, Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, not really? I can eat just about anything and be fine with it. I just thought it would be good for you to try some since I heard you don’t like it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I fail to understand your logic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Well, here’s what I was thinking: If you don’t like one type of spicy food, maybe you’ll find something that you </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> like if you try a different type, you know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. I see. Please do not cook spicy foods for me in the future, I truly do not like the taste at all,” Rhea very bluntly stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh…yeah, alright, I guess. Uh, what kind of foods do you like?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fish!” Flayn immediately suggested, earning an amused noise from Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I suppose I do enjoy fish. Some meat dishes can be quite good too, though truthfully I prefer colder foods,” she mused, considering what dishes she preferred, “Ah, there were some lovely fruits where I grew up that I still adore the taste of…ah, but never mind that. I would be happy to enjoy a meal with all of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she genuinely did feel happy to sit down with those she would consider family, listening to the children chat as they ate. She didn't join in, but she couldn't help but smile as they spoke about their shopping earlier. Rhea wondered when was the last time she could enjoy such simple pleasures as these. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Perhaps she'd be able to enjoy something like this even more once everything was right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know, it's really weird to think how much things have changed since the start of the year." Shez said aloud. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? What do you mean by that?" Rhea asked in return. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well you know, By and I weren't exactly happy about joining up here but…things actually turned out pretty nice. We have a bunch of friends now, and our little family has gotten bigger." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea felt herself frown. Because while that thought was a pleasant one, the fact that they hadn’t enjoyed being at the monastery at first…no, some wariness was excusable, they had been in a new place. She put her smile back up, allowing herself to dwell on those positive feelings instead of feeling that offense. “I am pleased to hear you have found a home here, Shez. The doors of the monastery, of course, will always be open to you and your family.’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, thanks Granny!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea paused. “...Rhea would be fine, child.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? But that doesn’t feel as familiar. How about Gram-Gram? Or Grammy? Or… Grarchbishop!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. Especially not that last one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez nodded. “Grarchbishop Grammy Gram.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea took a breath, because she was a calm individual in complete control of her emotions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…what about Grarchbishop Grhea?” Flayn suggested, and Rhea felt her eye twitch as Byleth visibly smothered a giggle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooo, good one!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Rhea is still the Archbishop, so you should refer to her with proper respect," Seteth reminded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I would prefer you keep that in mind. Regardless of our… relation, you should make sure not to refer to me as such in public. As the archbishop, having…a child is something that isn't really allowed." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…" Byleth frowned. "That's sad." </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"...Is that why Sitri was an 'orphan' at the monastery?" Jeralt asked, speaking up for the first time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yes. Though I cared for her deeply, I had to consider my position as well," Rhea explained with a deep frown on her face. It wasn't that far from the truth; she did truly consider Sitri, and all her preceding ‘sisters’, as her daughters. If she could have, she would have openly raised her as one, but… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you, for taking care of my mom, Rhea," Byleth said as she gave Rhea a small smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, Missus Sitri sounded like a great lady. And I guess if she was your kid, you must be pretty good too," Shez piped in, "I mean, you might have to be pretty stern cause of the archbishop stuff, but I guess under all that, you're still Rhea, huh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Rhea couldn't help but stare at Shez, someone who was Agarthan in nature if not nurture, being one of the first people to view her as simply Rhea. Strangely…it felt nice. "Thank you, Shez. That means a great deal to me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So can I call you Gram Gram-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No." She ignored how the girl pouted. Still, the dinner was enjoyable, though the topic of conversation eventually turned towards Byleth’s intention to leave the monastery at the end of the year, which still didn’t sit right with Rhea for many obvious reasons.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, Byleth had her reasons. "Honestly, even if I wasn't going to be working in the Empire, I would have likely tried to find new employment because I'm almost out of money." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me?" Rhea asked, genuinely confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, I haven't been getting any pay raises, so I've been having to use my own money to help pay for everything," Byleth explained, "I actually had to take some quick contracts to get a bit more gold." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Why have you not been getting a raise?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth brought up her hand as she began to list things off on her fingers, "The mock battle ended up being a mess, bringing back a bandit head on the first mission, leaving the mission early in Magdred before the knights gave the clear, the church was occupied with everything that happened in the mausoleum, I technically didn't even have a mission during Verdant Rain Moon, the church was busy again with everything involving the kidnapping, and apparently letting my student set the central pavilion on fire was not good," Byleth elaborated, "I think the mission against the Almyrans was the first time I actually managed to get a raise." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." With every example, Rhea slowly turned her head to Seteth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...To be clear, while I do hand out pay, I myself am not in charge of deciding the value of the payments. That is the cardinals’ duties," Seteth explained, completely throwing them under the carriage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you need money right now, kid?" Jeralt asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm good right now," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see." Rhea nodded. "Byleth, how would you like a hundred thousand gold?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"R-Rhea!?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come now Seteth, let me at least spoil my…granddaughter," Rhea said, trying to hide the slight unease she felt at saying that, "Actually, how about a million gold?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The room went silent, and Rhea ignored the wide-eyed stares she was receiving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez raised her hand. "Do I get an allowance too?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is not an allowance, it is payment for services rendered,” Rhea stated, “If you wish to be paid by the monastery, you would need to join as a staff member.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…can I get a hundred thousand gold as my starting salary?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You will have to negotiate that with Seteth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hmph. And here I was, thinking you were my favorite grandma…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea blinked at that, then felt…strangely hurt? Before she shook it off and decided to change the subject. “Child…how have things been for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, uh…" Shez shrugged. "Still weird knowing I'm apparently related to those weird people, but I'm doing better, at least." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…you were friends with Emily, right Shez?" Flayn asked with a frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yeah, still not sure what to think about her leaving," Shez muttered, not wanting to talk about her meeting with Kronya. "Ah, actually, I wanted to ask, has anything happened over in Ordelia territory?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, well, we have yet to receive any reports, but I imagine the Alliance will be able to handle matters now that Emperor Edelgard has dealt with the former Duke Aegir,” Rhea replied, “I imagine we will send your class over to aid the assembled forces there. It would be good to get some experience in seeing what a siege situation would be like.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you’re sending my kid into another war then,” Jeralt noted, making Rhea pause and grimace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…I understand your trepidation, Jeralt, but I assure you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can’t assure me of anything,” he bluntly countered, “Byleth lost an eye under your watch, in your monastery. I don’t believe for a second that you can keep either of my kids safe when it counts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, papa–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth, I'm putting my foot down. You've had too many near death experiences this year, and I don't want Shez to be in a situation like that again either." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, I can take care of myself! Besides, it's not like I'm going to go off by myself!" Shez insisted, making Byleth wince and Rhea frown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, that isn’t appropriate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, right–Sorry By, I didn’t–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay, I know I did something stupid,” Byleth muttered, before sighing, “Ah, why don’t we just get back to the food? Everything tastes really good, so good work there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, thanks! Heh, though it’s a little funny to hear you praise me considering you helped out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t do much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, you helped! And I appreciate it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps I could help next time?” Flayn offered, earning immediate winces from Seteth and Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah, maybe? Uh…actually, hey, By, do you think you’d ever want to teach a cooking class?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked at the suggestion, then looked thoughtful, plainly considering the idea. “Hm…that might be a fun idea, sure. You tend to cook more than I do though, and I’m not exactly used to cooking with only one eye. Would you like to be my assistant?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure! I’m up for that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea found herself smiling again as the children continued to chat, planning out an entire lesson for the students. It really was a nice idea, something calm and cheerful to let them be happy. And the happiness continued as Rhea was given her gifts, a lovely assortment of items and…as odd as it looked, she couldn't help but find the oddly shaped wooden carving that Shez gave her adorable. It didn't look anything like a dragon, but she enjoyed it nonetheless. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still…the problem in Ordelia did need to be dealt with. Treachery couldn’t be allowed, not when the Agarthans were active and she was so, so close to finally getting her mother back…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t think Jeralt could see her thoughts, but he likely had some idea of them, given how his gaze never softened for the rest of the evening. And once dinner was done, she wasn’t surprised to hear him request to speak with her in his office. Privately, so of course she sent Seteth off to spend the evening with his daughter while encouraging Flayn to spend time with their ‘extended family’ for an added distraction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is there an issue, Jeralt?” she began, trying to keep her tone cordial.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know there is, Rhea. I don’t care if Shez needs to be exempt from the rest of her class. I don’t want you sending her to a war field.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Jeralt, Byleth’s injury–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to hear it!” he interrupted, anger overriding what remaining fear he had of Rhea. The year had softened him towards her somewhat, but it also meant he was even less willing to put up with her shit, “Whatever you want to say, it won’t change the fact that someone who wanted to hurt my daughters got away with hiding in your clergy for almost a year! She kidnapped Shez, she maimed Byleth, what next? I know I trained them as mercenaries, I know I’ve put them in danger too, but damn it, I don’t want this kind of life for them! I was an idiot then, and I’d be even dumber now if I didn’t learn my damn lesson.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So make the mission a cooking class or whatever. I just…I need them to be safe, Rhea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Jeralt, the world is a dangerous place. If people like Acheron are not dealt with, the damage they cause can spread,” she replied, keeping her tone even. A part of her wanted to shout back, to show her anger at being questioned at every turn from a man who ran away…but, at his core, Jeralt wanted his children to be safe. And she didn’t want to drive him away again. “If you truly feel so strongly, you could go with them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. I’m not doing that,” he responded, frowning, “I’m not leaving Byleth unguarded either. I…look, I can stay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea paused. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean what I said. I can stay here. You should know already that Byleth wants to strike out into the world on her own, go work in the empire for the emperor, and odds are, Shez will follow right along with her. So I’ll stay here. I’ll keep being the captain of the knights, I’ll keep fighting for you, and I’ll give my kids a good reason to come visit.” Jeralt sighed. “I’m sure you have some big idea that Byleth can be someone important in the church or be your new Sitri or whatever it is you’re thinking, but she’s her own person. She’s going to want to spread her wings sooner instead of later. All I’m offering is that I help make this place somewhere she’ll want to land every so often.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea wasn’t sure if the flight metaphors were meant to imply something, but…would it really be such an issue to indulge Jeralt’s concerns? A part of her did want to argue, yet she could tell if she made any attempts to do so he would likely leave and take his daughters with him. And while she could stop him, she truly didn’t want to hurt her old friend. "...Very well, Jeralt, I'll see what I can do. For the time being, the students won't be on any missions this month."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Rhea.” The gratitude in his voice was so genuine, Rhea felt her heart waver again. Though, why should it? It wasn’t as though Byleth would be harmed, she was merely getting her memories back. She would know the truth, that she was Sothis, and things would be fine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Things had to be fine. Byleth, Jeralt, even Shez, they would all be fine. One day…they might even thank her for fixing things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite everything, Rhea didn’t sleep well that night.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>“Well well well, would you look at what we have here?” Lord Acheron Lethe Phlegethon smirked at the wayward woman who wandered onto his doorstep. Or, well, into his audience chamber. “To think, the apprentice of Lord Solon would come to visit. To what do I owe the pleasure?”</p><p> </p><p>“…Odesse, why do you have a mustache?” Bias asked, an eyebrow raised as she took in the altered shape of her fellow Agarthan.</p><p> </p><p>“Because it is an aspect of the character I have taken, obviously,” Odesse replied, curling one end of his mustache around his finger, “That, and I found it has grown on me.”</p><p> </p><p>“…Shut up. Where’s Myson?”</p><p> </p><p>“Lord Myson is quite busy–“</p><p> </p><p>“Then tell him I’m here, toady, and I have information he’ll want to hear.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah–Wait, Lady Bias–“ Odesse paused as she left, then let out an annoyed huff. “Being around the beasts certainly hasn’t improved her manners.”</p><p> </p><p>Moments later, after Bias found an empty lounge with comfy enough chairs to wait around in, the Agarthan sage glanced up to see her colleague enter with a smile on his bearded face. “Took you long enough.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s lovely to see you too, Bias,” Myson replied, her annoyance not affecting his mood in the slightest as he moved over to sit in the chair across from hers, “Would you like a drink?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No, I don’t want–“</p><p> </p><p>“Come now, you should try some tea,” he spoke over her, gesturing with a hand for Odesse to enter with an already-prepared tea set, “You’re up on the surface, indulge a little.”</p><p> </p><p>Bias glared at her fellow sage, though Myson hardly seemed to care as he poured himself a cup and took a sip. “So you’re going native now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm…Bias, have you ever considered what will happen to our people once we achieve our vengeance?”</p><p> </p><p>The sage blinked. “What? What the hell kind of question is that?”</p><p> </p><p>“An important one. One I doubt Thales or Solon ever truly considered.”</p><p> </p><p>“…I didn’t expect to hear that from you. I always thought you were Thales’s right hand.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I was. But Thales isn’t around, now is he? He’s been dead for years, and I’ve realized he had his own shortcomings. His goal was always to have revenge against the Fell Star and her abominations, but what would happen afterward? Would we content ourselves with slaying our age-old enemies? Would we happily live among the beasts? Would we slaughter every last one of them and continue on with a grand genocide of the entire world?</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a question we have to ask and answer. And I’ve found I enjoy the idea of actually using this land properly. Why shouldn’t we rule a new Agartha as its true masters? Especially when it has turned out the beasts have some surprising uses…but I digress. You wanted to report to me? I doubt you would have abandoned your mission at the monastery if you didn’t have anything to say.”</p><p> </p><p>Bias laughed, bitterly. “Believe me, I have plenty to say.”</p><p> </p><p>And once she recounted her story, with maybe one or two details omitted for convenience, Bias was annoyed to see Myson frowning at her.</p><p> </p><p>“So you didn’t bring Kronya with you?”</p><p> </p><p>She blinked. “That’s the part you focus on? What, did you have plans for that brat?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not really relevant now…hm. Actually, do you think you could pass for a convincing Flame Emperor?”</p><p> </p><p>“…what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…ah, I’ll fill you in on the details later. For now, do you think Kronya has been burned as well?”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably. The puppy isn’t exactly subtle. Who knows, maybe she managed to slay one or two of the beasts before getting killed?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, that’s annoying…no, it’s fine, we can still make things work. It’s good to know the great sage truly is active in that vessel, though it’s unfortunate you failed to kill the Fell Star. Not unforgivable, but certainly unfortunate.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. So what’s your plan here?”</p><p> </p><p>“In Ordelia? Acquiring materials and testing projects, obviously. The original Acheron provided us with a convenient opportunity to overtake a territory and use its resources as we see fit. The number of test subjects we’ve acquired is enormous compared to my previous policy of abducting travelers.” Myson grinned. “In a way, we managed to implement your late mentor’s plans on a grand scale. Instead of one village to use as a test bed, we have an entire county.”</p><p> </p><p>“For as long as it lasts,” Bias noted, “Solon’s plan would have caught attention sooner or later, and probably would have blown our covers anyway, which is what I was actually asking. How are you planning to hold all the gains you’ve acquired?”</p><p> </p><p>Right at that moment, the two sages heard a warhorn blow. Bias frowned, glancing in the direction of the sound, before she paused when she noticed the smile on Myson’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“Well isn’t that convenient? As for your question, Bias, I wouldn’t put too much value in what ultimately amounts to testing grounds.” He smirked. “After all, I have far bigger prizes in mind.”</p><hr /><p>“I have to say, this whole event is proving to be quite the Ordeal-ia,” Alois commented as he looked out over the fields leading towards Castle Ordelia. The castle itself was an impressive sight, nestled as it was atop a large hill that would be quite the climb to get up to. Not quite as bad as if it had been set up in the mountains that belonged to these lands, but then, the Ordelia family presumably still wanted people to visit their castletown. “I wonder if the other Alliance nobles ever realized Ache-er-ron would be such a pain?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Anyways,” Catherine said, ignoring him entirely in favor of focusing on the war map in front of her and Count Erwin Gloucester, the leader of the Alliance forces looking to reclaim Ordelia territory from the treacherous upstart that took it. “It looks like we’ll be in for a long siege here. From what our scouts reported, Acheron’s been upping taxes to insane levels in the time he’s been in charge, apparently hoarding as much food and gold as he can.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. Leaving aside the Weathervane’s greedy nature, I have to imagine even he realized he would need supplies if he wanted to last through any siege,” Erwin noted, frowning thoughtfully, “Depending on how full his food stores are, he could last for moons without having to meet us in battle.”</p><p> </p><p>“So the best move is to break him before he can get too cozy. Shamir’s already scouting out the area, and she should be back soon. Well, assuming she didn’t decide to just put an arrow in Acheron to begin with.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha, that would certainly save us some trouble,” the count joked, before looking serious again, “As for breaking the siege, Count Ordelia was quite helpful on the front. He provided me with a great deal of information regarding his castle’s layout and the placement of its defenses, which should make any assaults go far easier.”</p><p> </p><p>“Seriously? Wow, the Count must really trust you if he’s willing to give away big family secrets like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Erwin smiled, though it was a rueful one. “Yes, my friend certainly has put a great deal of faith in me. To the point that he confided his only real interest in reclaiming his territory is for the sake of his daughter and his people. Given his own poor health, I imagine he thinks reclaiming the land is worth extending his trust.”</p><p> </p><p>“I could see that, yeah,” Catherine agreed, nodding with a frown, “It’s still crazy to think about though. I know nobles in Faerghus that would sooner smash themselves against their own castle than let anyone else know about their defenses, even their own allies.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I suppose it’s a good thing Count Ordelia is willing to extend that trust to us. Now then–”</p><p> </p><p>“Lord Gloucester!” </p><p> </p><p>Erwin paused as one of his guards ran up, a frown coming to his face. “Yes? Did something happen?”</p><p> </p><p>“The gates opened, my lord! It seems Acheron is fielding his army!” the soldier reported, prompting blinks from Erwin and Catherine.</p><p> </p><p>“He is? Why in the world…”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Either he’s dumber than we thought, or he’s got something up his sleeve,” Catherine noted, walking over towards Alois, “Do you see anything out there?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Well I can’t say I was paying much attention to the castle until that young man shouted about how the enemy’s approaching, but yes, I do see many things,” the older knight replied, earning an eye roll from Catherine.</p><p> </p><p>“Like what, Alois?”</p><p> </p><p>“Like the fact that it doesn’t look like he has much of an army at all,” Alois pointed out, gesturing towards the fields in the distance.</p><p> </p><p>And yeah, Catherine had to admit she was surprised by what she was seeing too. “Hang on…are there only twenty of them?”</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes didn’t deceive her. The group of armored knights striding out from the outer gates of Castle Ordelia clearly only numbered twenty in total. They stood in four rows of five, lined up perfectly, and even from a distance, it was clear the black-armored knights were taller than average. That didn’t change the fact that there were twenty on their side and over a thousand on Catherine’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Do you think they’re looking to challenge us to single combat?” Alois suggested.</p><p> </p><p>“You think they’re looking to settle things with one fight?” Catherine asked, glancing at the senior knight, “Why send out more than one then?”</p><p> </p><p>“It could be an attempt at intimidation. A way of saying ‘oh, look at us, we have scary knights on our side too!’ Or something like that.”</p><p> </p><p>"Well I wouldn't put it like that, but whatever knights he does have are certainly quite large." Erwin pointed out, frowning as he looked at the armored knights. "I imagine they're likely men that the former Duke Aegir provided." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah and they're basically sitting ducks out there right now," Catherine said as she looked over the field. </p><p> </p><p>"Even so, we should try to parley with him, shouldn’t we? Even if his forces won't amount to much, it would be best that we prevent any fighting," Alois suggested. </p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps. I’ll send one of my men to see what they want,” Erwin decided, moving to his troops to call out for a messenger.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I guess we’ll have to wait for this parley party to get off the ground then!” Alois crossed his arms over his chest, tilting his head in thought. “Hm…a parlarty? No, that’s too wordy…”</p><p> </p><p>Catherine would have rolled her eyes at Alois’s antics under most circumstances, yet for some reason, she found herself staring at the group of knights. They stood tall on the field and strangely still. She could mistake them for statues if they hadn’t been moving earlier.</p><p> </p><p>Imperial knights tended to use black armor, but this group’s equipment looked different. Something about the shade of black, deep and dark in a material that she vaguely recognized, and the horned helmets they wore, modeled like a goat’s head…</p><p> </p><p>Catherine had always prided herself on a certain talent of hers, that being the ability to tell at a glance if someone had a crest, and what crest it could be. And something about these men looked wrong.</p><p> </p><p>“...hey, Alois, maybe–” One of them looked at her. Straight at her. And then he was in front of her and she leapt back as an axe smashed into the dirt where she just stood.</p><p> </p><p>“Wha–How in the–” Alois exclaimed, only to have to leap out of the way as another appeared and nearly smashed him with a brutal warhammer.</p><p> </p><p>Thunderbrand was in Catherine’s hands in a second as she slashed back at the knight, her eyes going wide when she saw her pronged blade catch on the knight’s black shield.</p><p> </p><p>“How the hell–” The shield shoved forward and she felt herself go skidding back, the force nearly sending her off her feet. She stumbled, but then the axe was coming down towards her head and she had to defend as best she could. </p><p> </p><p><em> Fast, he’s way too fast for a big bastard, how is he moving like this– </em> Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the other knight vanish in a purple light, reappearing to smash his hammer into the shield Alois just barely brought up to save his chest from getting caved in. He still went flying, crashing hard on the ground, and Catherine scowled at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>“You bastards have no idea who you’re going up against!” she yelled, before deflecting a blow from the knight’s axe, getting around his unprotected side and swinging straight for his neck. </p><p> </p><p>Thunderbrand, gleaming with the power her crest poured into it, sliced straight through the knight’s neck, cleaving through black steel and mail to separate his head from his body. The helmeted head sailed through the air, though Catherine was already moving, leaping over the map to strike at the hammer-wielder. The second knight took the blow on his own shield before trying to crush her with his weapon, entirely unbothered by the surprise attack and his comrade’s sudden death.</p><p> </p><p><em> If nothing else, these pricks are well-disciplined,</em> Catherine allowed, continuing her onslaught of strikes and slices while the knight weathered the storm, using his shield to block as best he could while still taking cuts that rent through parts of his armor. Ultimately, in a battle of attrition, Catherine would likely win just from the sheer damage she could put out.</p><p> </p><p>At least, that would be the case if she didn’t feel an axe slam straight into her back.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Catherine’s mind went back to that day, many, many years ago, when Lady Rhea had saved her life. The wound she had taken then felt similar, though as she laid on the ground, trying desperately to figure out just how broken her body was, she felt herself thinking that this one was likely worse. And Lady Rhea wasn’t here this time.</p><p> </p><p>She could move, that much she put together, and it felt like her armor had taken the brunt of the blow, enough that she could live, even if it was painful to move. </p><p> </p><p>She could see the knights moving away, leaving her for dead, and she saw, plain as day, that the man–the <em> thing </em> she decapitated–walked away. Then her mind swam, her muscles straining as she tried to get up–</p><p> </p><p>“Catherine! Oh thank the goddess you’re still alive–Here, we need to get you up!”</p><p> </p><p>Firm hands pulled her up, arms supporting her as she blinked at Alois. “Ah…ah, all…”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Why isn’t my mouth working? My jaw hurts. Or…my tongue? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You took a nasty hit there, but don’t worry, I have you! Can you walk?”</p><p> </p><p>She could stand. Or, she thought she could. Her legs seemed to be obeying her but it was difficult to keep her feet.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, I can get you to a healer but we need to move fast! These knights are far more dangerous than we–“</p><p> </p><p>Alois went stiff. Catherine understood why, because through the ringing in her ears, she heard it.</p><p> </p><p>The roaring and screeching of demonic beasts.</p><hr /><p>“To make things simpler, I’ve decided to classify the saurian ‘demonic beast’ types according to their variants with names I found appropriate,” Myson explained as he gestured out over the walls of Castle Ordelia, towards the burning camp in the distance, “The land-based saurians shall henceforth be known as Ladons while the flying variants shall be Delphons. As for my new creations, our remarkably effective knights shall be known as Tyrants.” He smiled, looking at Bias. “Fitting names, wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Well, you’ve sure been busy,” Bias replied, watching the devastation with disinterest. </p><p> </p><p>"For a scientist, I'm surprised at how disinterested you are in my creations. Or perhaps you've chosen to forsake your path?" Myson asked, as he looked back over the battle. </p><p> </p><p>"I have something else I wish to focus on. And they aren't here right now." </p><p> </p><p>"Right, the Fell Star. I must admit I am curious about what sort of body it must have. If it has the Crest Stone within it, acting as a heart, it must be quite the fascinating sight. Do their organs even work like the rest of the beasts? You've seen the Fell Star bleed, so something must pump blood within it, but is it possible to remove its heart while leaving it alive…?" </p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. Catch the Fell Star yourself if you want to vivisect her,” Bias replied, annoyed, “I intend to kill the bitch the next time I see her though, so you’d better act fast.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why do we need to make it a competition? She dies either way. My decision would simply make it a more productive death than simple incineration. You can derive a surprising amount of use from crest-afflicted bodies.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Despite her annoyance, Bias found herself getting curious. “Such as?”</p><p> </p><p>“Such as my Tyrants. You might have noticed they are a good deal larger than the average beast.” Myson grinned. “The King of Liberation turned out to be a useful template to work with. Why have just one vicious barbarian on your side when you can have two dozen? Sure they might not be as intelligent as a fully resurrected beast, but they serve their purpose. That being said, I'm sure we can make even greater weapons if she was captured alive.</p><p> </p><p>His smile widened. “Think about it: an army of Fell Stars. Taking all of Fodlan would be as easy as crushing an ant. And what's to stop us from expanding from there? If we play our cards right, we can take over the entire world," Myson said, reaching his hand out, as if to grasp the horizon. </p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Bias asked, an eyebrow raised.</p><p> </p><p>“Because we can. Because it is our right to.” He turned to her, smirking. “And if that is not enough to assure your loyalty, then allow me to make another offer.” He held up a hand, fingers splayed. “Five years of service, and I will bring your sister back to life.”</p><p> </p><p>There were few things at this point in her life that could shake Bias, not when she had allowed the fury inside of her to consume her every moment. Yet, for a moment, that fury flickered. “...what?”</p><p> </p><p>“You heard me.” He continued to smirk, folding his arms behind his back.</p><p> </p><p>“...how would…she’d been crushed. She had been completely buried, there wasn’t–”</p><p> </p><p>“There were still remains. If even the barest scrap of flesh remained, then we have a chance, don’t we?”</p><p> </p><p>“...th-that…”</p><p> </p><p>“Think about it,” he said, turning his gaze back towards the devastation his creations were unleashing, “Oh, and before you ask, yes, I could do the same for Thales. I don’t have a reason to though. So if you want me to take an interest in this project…you would have to give me a reason.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Bias stared at her fellow sage, her hands starting to tremble at her sides. The thought of having Pittacus back…For so long, she just wanted vengeance. But if she could have her back…</p><p> </p><p>A movement out of the corner of her eye caught her attention, and, in a sudden movement, Bias moved between Myson and the arrow that was about to pierce his back. It stabbed through her hand, making her grit her teeth, before she glared straight at the filthy rat that dared try to ruin her chance.</p><p> </p><p>That Dagdan bitch caught her eyes for barely a second before the archer started moving, looking to escape while Bias snarled in fury and unleashed a flame that scorched a massive part of the ramparts, earning a small smile from Myson as he turned to watch.</p><p> </p><p>Even if it had been bought, loyalty was a beautiful thing. </p><p> </p><p>As the screams and the roars of the battlefield continued, Myson enjoyed his victory. It would be the first of many. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Silently staring out over Garreg Mach, Shez took note of all the students wandering around. All of them, going about their days, trying to act as if nothing was wrong. As if their peaceful everyday lives would remain forever… if they knew what she knew… the knowledge she was cursed with- </p><p> </p><p>"Shez! What are you doing up there!?" Letting out a small yelp, Shez almost went tumbling off the building she was brooding on when she heard Dimitri yell up at her. "You're going to hurt yourself, get down!" </p><p> </p><p>"No! I'm up here for a reason!" </p><p> </p><p>"...Why are you wearing a cloak?" </p><p> </p><p>"Because I'm brooding!" </p><p> </p><p>"...I'm going to get Captain Jeralt!" </p><p> </p><p>"He can't do anything about this! And besides, I’m fine! I can warp if I fall! So ha!”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I'll get Professor Byleth!”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be a snitch!” Shez yelled back, only to pause as she heard the flap of pegasus wings.</p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me, young lady, but students aren't allowed on rooftops. Please come with me, or I will have to take disciplinary actions." Frowning heavily, Shez refused to look at the pegasus knight as she got on the flying steed with her. Moments later, she was on the ground, with her cloak confiscated. </p><p> </p><p>"You better give that back!" </p><p> </p><p>"You'll get this back when we aren't dealing with crazed cultists," the knight responded before flying off. </p><p> </p><p>"...so, what exactly happened?" Dimitri cautiously asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Just… thinking about stuff," Shez responded, "Sorry for yelling at you." </p><p> </p><p>"It's okay, I just want to make sure you don't get hurt. Even if you are a part of the Golden Deer now, you were a member of the Blue Lions." </p><p> </p><p>"...Thanks. I might have just been… trying to deal with some stuff by acting like it was a story, you know?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not particularly. I've never been one for leisurely reading if I'm honest." </p><p> </p><p>"...You know, I'm not surprised," Shez responded, before actually thinking about what she said. "Was that rude?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, it's how it is in Faerghus. We don't look down upon reading, but there's a far bigger focus on training when we're younger. So, at the very least for me, most of my reading usually only involves schoolwork, or reports on what's happening in the kingdom." </p><p> </p><p>"...Huh." </p><p> </p><p>"So, do you want to talk about what brought you up there?" </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, well…you heard about what happened in Ordelia, right?”</p><p> </p><p>"...Yes, the knights suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat, weren't they?" Dimitri asked, frowning as he remembered the details he had heard. "To think a force nearly a thousand strong ended up losing." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. We don't even know who made it out or not since the knights got separated," Shez muttered, scratching the back of her head, "I don't like Catherine, but I don't want to hear she or Shamir ended up dying in some random battle, and dad would get pretty sad if Alois is dead." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, it would be a devastating blow to lose any of them. I just hope the knights who retreated to Gloucester territory are able to return soon enough." </p><p> </p><p>Shez made a noise of agreement, before pausing when she saw Lysithea storming on by, a bag on her back. "Uh, excuse me Dimitri, I gotta check something." Jogging off before Dimitri could say anything, Shez moved in front of Lysithea before she could get to the monastery gates. "Woah, where are you going?" </p><p> </p><p>"To Ordelia territory!" the diminutive mage said, already a bit out of breath from the large bag she was carrying. "Now get out of my way!" </p><p> </p><p>"H-Hey now, you can't just go off to Ordelia by yourself!" Shez insisted, moving in front of the mage again. "We don't even know how many men Acheron has left!" </p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t matter! I need to fix things!”</p><p> </p><p>“How?? You’re one person and they beat a whole army!”</p><p> </p><p>"That doesn't mean I shouldn't try!" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes it does, you could die!"</p><p> </p><p>"So what?!" Lysithea shouted, trying to push past her again. "I was already prepared to!" </p><p> </p><p>Frowning, Shez grabbed her, before warping away and ending up in front of the noble’s room. "Alright, we need to talk." </p><p> </p><p>"What the hell is your problem!?" </p><p> </p><p>"What's my problem? You're the one going off into a death trap!" </p><p> </p><p>"That's because I want to make sure my parents are okay!" Lysithea shouted, frustrated tears starting to sting her eyes. "I was already prepared to die anyways!"</p><p> </p><p>Shez winced, but put her hands back on Lysithea’s shoulders, holding her in place. “Your parents are okay. Count Gloucester has them at his house, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“And he might be dead now! What do you think is going to happen to them if he isn’t around, huh?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably nothing! If they’re still in his castle, nobody can get to them! That’s why castles have walls! And…and moats! Don’t they have a moat?”</p><p> </p><p>"That doesn't keep people out forever," Lysithea grumbled, frowning as she glared at the floor. </p><p> </p><p>"Well yeah, but it'll keep them safe for now! I mean, your parents probably want you to be safe too, right? Especially since…" Shez frowned. She still felt a bad taste in her mouth at the thought of Edelgard, but she could shrug that off for the moment. "You'll be going to the Empire to get better, right?"</p><p> </p><p>“...No. No, I’m not going to."</p><p> </p><p>"What? Why not?" </p><p> </p><p>"Because I don't want to give them false hope. I don't even know if this will actually fix me, so if it doesn't work, I don't want to break their hearts. As far as they're aware, I'm just going to the Empire to study some more."</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez sighed. “Okay, Lysithea, this is awkward for me to say because I had a whole thing with Edelgard and I got mad and I still feel weird about it because of how I got angry–My point is! Even though I’m mad at Edelgard, I want you to get better. And I think going to the Empire is your best shot at getting better. They have the resources to help you and Edelgard has the same problem you have, so at least you know she’s on your side.”</p><p> </p><p>"So I'm just supposed to stand by and not do anything for my parents?" </p><p> </p><p>"Look, you know what By has been through lately. Dad…he hasn't been taking it well. I don't even want to know how he'd react if she actually did die," Shez said, feeling her throat tighten up a bit, "Even if your parents think you're dying, they don't want you to die before them." </p><p> </p><p>"...Then what am I supposed to do?" </p><p> </p><p>“Ah…well, we can’t just go to Ordelia to fight Acheron. And school’s…kind of weird right now? We could try hanging out with everyone, but I feel like you actually want to do something instead of just hanging out…though we could make something sweet?” She tilted her head, thinking. “Hm…alright, for today, you and I are gonna hang out.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? You just said–”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I know, but this is different! We’re gonna find stuff to do! Maybe we cook, maybe we read some tomes, maybe we explore the secrets of the monastery! Either way, it’s gonna be just you and me, doing stuff! Okay?”</p><p> </p><p>"N-No? I'm not just going to–" Before Lysithea could finish arguing, Shez grabbed her hand, dragging her along to the dining hall, preparing for the day with some sweets at the dining hall. Specifically the Shez started to bake some, with Lysithea half-heartedly joining in. It was a start, if nothing else. </p><p> </p><p>"So, any idea on how graduation is supposed to go?" Shez asked, glancing down at her friend. </p><p> </p><p>"It's apparently a small ceremony before we get sent back home. Nothing that fancy, really," Lysithea muttered, stirring a bowl. </p><p> </p><p>"Huh…well that's lame. We've been doing this for an entire year and we don't even get a big party?" </p><p> </p><p>"It's still a monastery. As far as I'm aware, we're free to do whatever we want as we prepare to go home." </p><p> </p><p>"...so we could throw a party ourselves." </p><p> </p><p>"I am fairly certain you'll get in trouble if you do anything that gets out of hand." </p><p> </p><p>"Still something to consider." </p><p> </p><p>"No it isn't."</p><p> </p><p>"Agree to disagree."</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea let out an annoyed huff, before looking away, pausing as she saw Dorothea and Byleth chatting together in a corner of the dining hall. "Huh, the professor and Dorothea have been pretty close lately." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh right, uh…can you keep a secret?" Shez asked, getting Lysithea to cock an eyebrow. "Right." </p><p> </p><p>Leaning down, she whispered into her ear. "They're what!?" </p><p> </p><p>"N-Not so loud!" Shez said, trying to shush her, as she glanced over at the other pair. She stiffened for a moment when she saw them looking over for a few seconds, before going back to chatting. </p><p> </p><p>"Since when have they been…" Lysithea gestured with her hands, unsure of what to say. </p><p> </p><p>"A week or two? I think?" Shez said, shrugging her shoulders. "I'm not sure on the specifics. Like, yes, I like teasing my sister over her having a crush on someone, but now that she's actually dating someone it feels weird, you know?" </p><p> </p><p>“...not exactly.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right, you, uh…Yeah, I’m gonna stop talking,” Shez decided…though she decided against it a second later. “Seriously though, you get it, right? It feels weird having her be all lovey dovey.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would it be weird?” Lysithea asked, wondering how exactly her smiling a bit more than usual was lovey dovey. </p><p> </p><p>“I…don’t know? It’s like…I dunno. It’s a change, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“...It sounds like you’re worried someone is going to take your sister away from you.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No, that’s not…That’d be weird.”</p><p> </p><p>“Would it? She almost died–She was hurt badly recently,” Lysithea corrected herself after noticing Shez flinch, “It would make sense if you were feeling protective right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“...maybe. Yeah, that might be it.” For some reason though, that didn’t feel right to her. And as Shez let her mind dwell on the issue, she couldn’t help but remember the hurt she felt when her sister told her she’d gone to Edelgard instead of her. “...so, uh, you got something else to talk about? Something different?”</p><p> </p><p>"Well…have you been keeping up with your studies?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, totally! Things have been busy, but I've been making sure to read my tome before I go to sleep," Shez said, before laughing, "Though sometimes it just makes me go to sleep faster." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course.” Lysithea rolled her eyes. "It's a miracle you haven't somehow failed the year already." </p><p> </p><p>"Hey come on, I'm not that dumb. Besides, Balthus would probably fail before I did, and he already went to the academy!" Shez huffed in response, "Heck, I know I'm smarter than Kronya at least." </p><p> </p><p>"Who’s Kronya?" At the question, Shez stiffened. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, well, you know she's…an old cat I had. Cause you know…Nya." </p><p> </p><p>"...So you're bragging about being smarter than a cat?" </p><p> </p><p>“...Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>The look Lysithea gave Shez was one of confusion mixed with pity. “...If it’s any consolation, I would have said you were smarter than Emily.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh hey, that’s what–Wait, you said that weirdly. Why the emphasis on ‘would have’?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well it was before I learned your bar for intelligence was a cat.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, cats are smart! I've seen them open doors." Despite her ironclad argument, Shez saw Lysithea stare at her with complete pity. “...hmph. Cats are definitely smart.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not what I’m–Shez, your measure for intelligence is being smarter than a cat. Cats can be smart, sure, but I have seen more of them bump into doors than open doors.”</p><p> </p><p>“...HEY BYLETH!” Shez shouted, catching her sister’s attention, “CATS ARE SMART, RIGHT?”</p><p> </p><p>“THEY’RE NOT SMARTER THAN PEOPLE,” Byleth shouted back, before returning to her conversation with Dorothea.</p><p> </p><p>“...feh. Let’s just bake stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>Rolling her eyes again, Lysithea focused back on preparing the food, putting more effort into it now, which prompted a smile from Shez when she saw her friend no longer feeling so down. Sure, she might have humiliated herself there but it still worked! </p><hr /><p>"So, what are we working on now?" Shez asked, glancing over the tomes she and Lysithea had. </p><p> </p><p>"I've actually been studying faith magic recently. Specifically I've been trying to get a handle on warp." </p><p> </p><p>"Huh? But I can just warp whenever, so why do you need to learn it?" </p><p> </p><p>"It's not like we're going to be by each other all the time. Besides, even if we are by each other, you might run out of energy to do that, right?" Lysithea said as she focused at the tome. </p><p> </p><p>“Uh…huh, I guess so, yeah.” Shez tilted her head, thinking. “Hm…hey do you think there’s a difference between my warp and the other warp? Like, mine is all shadowy but the other one is all lighty, so…yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>“...are you just trying to make conversation right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, mostly? But I also am kind of curious.”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea sighed before closing her book. "Well, from the outside your warp definitely has some advantages. You can use it on yourself and one other to travel great distances as long as you can visualize the location, correct?" At Shez’s nod, she continued. "You even seem to be able to warp short distances continuously, something warp isn't really used for. However, you can't send someone without sending yourself." </p><p> </p><p>"And? That doesn't seem like a downside." </p><p> </p><p>"It could be. Let's say you're covering an important location, but someone asks you to warp them elsewhere. What happens if, once you go with them, you realize you're out of long distance warps? Suddenly that place you were covering is missing a strong warrior." </p><p> </p><p>“Huh. That’s…a good point. Hm…I wonder if I can learn the other type of warp…”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would you want–No, I can see how you came to that idea. I don’t think you should though, it might interfere with your usual magic. Come to think of it, don’t you have issues with faith magic?”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh…I wouldn’t say I have issues with it, it just doesn’t come as easy to me as reason magic.” Shez shrugged with a frown. "It's like…it feels like it takes twice as much focus to cast a faith spell than it does a reason spell. As it stands I'm already a better swordsman than mage, so I haven't been putting as much effort in it as I do with reason." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, I suppose I can understand your reasoning. It's better to focus on what you're skilled at than what you're not." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, exactly. I mean, I doubt you'd ever go around wearing heavy armor." </p><p> </p><p>Lysithea grimaced. “No, I don’t think I ever would. It would get in the way of my focus, and I doubt I'll be able to float with it on." </p><p> </p><p>"Wait what?" Shez asked, blinking in surprise. </p><p> </p><p>"Some mages, when they reach a high enough level, can use magic to move around in the air." </p><p> </p><p>"...You can fly?" Shez said, a mixture of awe and jealousy in her voice. </p><p> </p><p>“Not at the moment, no, but perhaps one day. And it’s not exactly like unassisted flight, I would still have to remain close enough to the ground or else I would plummet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Still, that sounds really cool…”</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t you fly already? You turn into that small ball of shadow.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well that’s not…huh. Does that count? I don’t think that counts.” Shez pursed her lips in thought. "...Would I look cool with wings?" </p><p> </p><p>"Why is that your question?" </p><p> </p><p>"Because things with wings can fly, so I want to know if I could look cool with them." </p><p> </p><p>"I…suppose? I don't even know how that would work…" Lysithea said, before shaking her head. "Is there anything else you want to talk about, or can we focus on studying?" </p><p> </p><p>"Um…oh, it's your birthday at the end of the month, yeah?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Yes, what about it?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I was thinking we can do something big! I mean, it'll be the last party of the school year right?" Shez asked, before pausing. "Wait no, Ignatz's birthday is next month, but that's when everyone is leaving…maybe we try celebrating his early?" </p><p> </p><p>"So we don't need to do anything for my birthday." </p><p> </p><p>"What? No, we still are. I mean, even if it's just us two, we should still celebrate. In fact, what do you wanna do? It'll be my treat." </p><p> </p><p>"I would prefer to have a quiet day studying." </p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure? Actually, wait, what would you be studying for? We don’t have anything big at the end of the year…do we?”</p><p> </p><p>“Shez, if I’m going to stay here instead of going to fight the people holding my family's territory, I need to at least spend that time studying what knowledge the monastery can provide for me. I don’t know if there’s anything that can help me with my condition here, but it won’t hurt to look, now will it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay, that makes sense…Oh, wait, I know what we can do!”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea sighed. “Shez, I’m not interested if it’s anything other than studying magic. At least, right now. We could maybe get more sweets later…”</p><p> </p><p>“Then that’s great, because it totally is about studying magic! There’s a whole forbidden library down in Abyss!”</p><p> </p><p>“...ah. Right. Abyss. The…dark, underground city filled with ghost knights…”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No there's no ghosts….I think. They might have been magical but I'm pretty sure they weren't ghosts." </p><p> </p><p>“That’s not at all what I heard! There were ghost knights and golems and someone turned into a monster–”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, no, that last one definitely didn’t happen, I would remember that part. Some demonic beasts showed up, but pretty sure no one turned into one." Shez smiled at her. "Besides, even if ghosts showed up, I'll make sure to protect you!" </p><p> </p><p>"And how exactly are you going to fight a ghost?" Arval asked, which Shez didn't answer to avoid freaking out her friend. </p><p> </p><p>“H-Hm…well, I suppose you’re not the worst bodyguard to have,” Lysithea admitted, before sighing, “Fine, I guess we can try it. But I reserve the right to say I told you so if we have to deal with any angry ghosts!”</p><p> </p><p>“Heh, don’t worry! Like I said, I’ll take care of everything!”</p><hr /><p>"Alright, here we go!" Shez stated, smiling as she and Lysithea walked around Abyss. </p><p> </p><p>"H-Hm…it's certainly much larger than I expected." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, and this is only where the people are living. There's plenty of tunnels and stuff hidden down here. Though we don't need to go down there, since we mainly wanted to see the town." </p><p> </p><p>"Right…well what exactly is down here?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, there's the library like I said, and there's also a scrap pile where a bunch of old gear gets thrown. Leonie comes down here every now and then to see if she can find stuff I think. Oh, and there's also the wayseer." </p><p> </p><p>"A wayseer?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, she can apparently tell how close people are," Shez said, before blinking as she remembered what she heard when she was down here the first time. "N-Not that it's accurate. I mean, how exactly can she tell that when she's down here?" </p><p> </p><p>“Probably through magic,” Lysithea pointed out, her voice deadpan.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, yeah, but magic is things like throwing fire or ice, not seeing who people are in love with–Or, uh, not in love with, I think, just…close? With…emotions. And stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Shez, magic is capable of doing much more than just throwing around elements. Have you paid attention in class at all?” She paused. “Then again, the majority of magic taught in class is combat-related…”</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah exactly! And besides, when I was a mercenary, it was all about combat magic. I overheard Constance doing something with tea being all rainbow-y but that's not really something I'll use." </p><p> </p><p>"Fine. So what else is there down here?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, there's like, a statue from Dagda? Apparently it's a goddess of fate or something?"</p><p> </p><p>"What?"</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, right over there.” Shez pointed at the statue in question, which indeed portrayed a large, winged being, hooded and cloaked. “I think you can make offerings to her?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yes, I imagine you can make offerings to a statue of a goddess. Why would you want to though?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…well, hey, why not? Maybe she’ll do something nice for us?”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea scoffed. “Our goddess never did…”</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, well, even more reason to give an offering to someone else, cause screw her." </p><p> </p><p>"Shez, I don't think you can say that." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah? Well what's she going to do? She hasn't done anything nice for us," Shez said, smiling at Lysithea before dragging her off to the statue. </p><p> </p><p>“Ugh…what do you even plan to give her?" </p><p> </p><p>"Um…" Shez began to pat her pockets, before pausing and pulling out a small bag of cookies. "Ha! Still had some left over. Come on we both made them so we should both try praying." </p><p> </p><p>"You're the one– Oh fine, whatever," Lysithea huffed as Shez put the bag in front of the goddess of fate, before the two clasps their hand in a small prayer. </p><p> </p><p><em> I hope nothing changes, </em>Shez thought to herself, before nodding after a few moments. </p><p> </p><p>"Alright, that should be good." </p><p> </p><p>"Can we go to the library now?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, sure thing–" Shez blinked, hearing a small tink as her hair suddenly fell in front of her eye. Looking down, she saw her hairclip on the ground, having somehow snapped. "Aw dang it, can't believe it broke." </p><p> </p><p>"What exactly broke?" Lysithea asked as Shez crouched down. </p><p> </p><p>"A hairclip By gave me, it was actually the first gift she gave me," Shez huffed, looking at it in her hand, "I know I've had it for a long time, but I didn't think it'd just break like that." </p><p> </p><p>“...hm. I…hm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? What’s up?” she asked, glancing curiously at Lysithea, who was frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“...You said this goddess is from Dagda, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? What about it?”</p><p> </p><p>“...It’s probably nothing. I just…It’s a shame Shamir isn’t here right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yeah, it is. She’s always been cool. Not sure what she sees in Catherine, but…hey, they’re probably fine. I wouldn’t worry about them, they can handle themselves.”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea huffed. “I wasn’t worried.”</p><p> </p><p>"In that case, why don't we go to the library?" Shez asked, putting away her hair clip. "Though, fair warning, not all of it is magic stuff." </p><p> </p><p>“Why would you mention that? I’m only interested in the magic books, I wouldn’t bother reading the rest of them.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well sure, but there’s plenty of fun stuff in some of the banned books. A few of them are some pretty raunchy romance novels.”</p><p> </p><p>“That–Why would I be interested in that?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Well some of them are pretty good. You can skip over the pervy parts if you want to–”</p><p> </p><p>“Shez, just…help me find books I’ll actually want to read, please. And no romance books!”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, okay,” Shez agreed, smiling a little as she followed her fuming friend.</p><p> </p><p>And behind her, the altar to Dagda’s Goddess of Fate stayed as still as it always did, an unmoving statue far from home and uncared for by those above. None noticed when what had to be a trace of cave water dripped down its cheek, for a statue could not mourn the fate of those who gave it offerings.</p>

  <span>“Do try to keep up,” Myson, current Sage of Thunder and one of the remaining leaders of the Agarthan people, chided, not sparing a single glance back as his technical equal Bias followed him up a well-worn road crossing through the plains of Faerghus, “You’ve been out in the field for close to a year now, you should be used to physical activity.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well forgive me for having trouble with these shitty roads,” Bias growled out, glaring at her annoyingly fit colleague. Her feet ached, but she kept up her pace anyway, unwilling to give him the satisfaction of falling behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would believe you if you weren’t stumbling with every step,” the warlock taunted, his arms folded behind his back as he strode along the barren road.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t be stumbling if we just warped to the meeting point.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But then I wouldn’t be able to listen to your struggles. Would you really deprive me of such a lovely sound?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias grunted but kept quiet. There was no need to give the bastard any sense of satisfaction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, she couldn’t help but comment when she actually saw where they were meeting. “Did that bitch really bring a tent out here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Calling it a tent felt like an understatement. It looked like some kind of royal war tent, big and boxy and all in Faerghus blue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Someone’s enjoying her position,” Myson commented, audibly amused as he walked towards the tent’s entrance, which was guarded by a pair of armored knights in azure plate wielding Agarthan spears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The pair nodded at Myson before one of them opened up the tent flap to let them in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Myson and Bias! My, what a reunion this is turning out to be~!” Cleobulus was wearing her guise, the skin of some overly impressive hedge mage that conned her way into court through curing a plague or some shit. Bias couldn’t care less, though she also couldn’t help but notice Cleo’s tits were massive now. She could have sworn the bitch had smaller honkers the last time she saw her… “All of the remaining sages, in one place.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cleobulus, Chilon,” Myson greeted, nodding to her and him in turn, “It really is quite the reunion. To think our number was reduced so far…but alas, it seems to be how things go sometimes. Random chance took two of us, and the treachery of beasts took a third.” He clapped a hand to Bias’s shoulder in a parody of a consoling gesture. “And poor Bias nearly lost an eye preventing my own assassination. How fortunate I am to have her by my side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? You two seem close,” Cleobulus commented, smirking as Bias glowered at her and pushed Myson’s hand off her shoulder, “Heh. No need to be shy, dear. You can share your interests with us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...can we get on with it?” Bias requested, earning a titter from Cleobulus.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s no need to rush, Bias. Why not regale us with the tale? I am curious as to why your hand is bandaged.” Cleobulus smiled, no hint of concern in her voice, only sadistic interest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She took an arrow through it,” Myson explained, “A knight of the church decided to take a shot at me and Bias chased her off.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Chase her off? Why didn’t she kill the beast?” Chilon asked, his voice reverberating in his helmet. Bias sneered at the lummox, but if it bothered him, it didn’t show. Which was probably why the prick always wore heavy armor like that. He probably had the worst poker face otherwise…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The bitch was faster than I thought,” Bias answered, “Does it matter? The beasts can’t do anything even if she overheard us. We didn’t talk about anything important.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I consider my projects quite important,” Myson commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No one cares.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, no need to be rude to hide your affections, Bias,” Cleobulus teased, her smile mocking, “And how have things gone for you lately, hm? I could have sworn you were supposed to still be at the monastery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was, but I saw a chance to kill the Fell Star and took it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, so the Fell Star does walk among us again…though I can’t imagine you succeeded.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I cost her an eye, at least.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooo, that is impressive. Probably doesn’t mean much in the long run, but I suppose allowances can be made for you abandoning your post since you wounded our greatest enemy in the process.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. I would not make such an allowance,” Chilon complained, plainly glaring Bias.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes yes, your adherence to protocol is very inspiring, now let the adults talk,” Cleobulus dismissed, “So, the Fell Star returned and is maimed at our own flame sage’s hands. Excellent news, though it doesn’t mean we’re anywhere near done yet. So now the question becomes, what shall we, the wayward children of our lost land, do now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t it obvious?” Chilon questioned, “We’ll slaughter those abominations and their ilk in the church and reclaim our homeland from the beasts that populate it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson sighed. “Yes, we all know that part. The question Cleobulus is asking is how we are going to go about it, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Correct,” Cleobulus purred, smirking, “I have a good thing going right now in Faerghus. A force of beasts under my authority, a ‘king’ that will follow his leash so long as it is in my hand, and a hapless populace I can abuse at my leisure~ Should I expect to use this all for the sake of Agartha as a whole, or are we going to have issues, Myson?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The warlock simply smiled, before placing a hand on his chest and bowing deeply. “I do not foresee any issues between us, Agastya.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chilon stiffened while Cleobulus smiled. “Oh ho! I do like a man who knows his place, Myson~ I am surprised you’re so willing to give up your authority though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As far as I am concerned, authority means little when it comes to the success of our people. Victory or defeat shall lie with you, our glorious leader, while I will content myself with my own projects.” His smile widened as he straightened. “So long as I am allowed to experiment as I wish, you have my full support.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm…then, as thanks for that, perhaps I could offer some new stock for those experiments~? The people of Faerghus should have different constitutions, when compared to those of Adrestia and Leicester.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would be very pleased with that, Agastya Cleobulus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That title is not official,” Chilon bit out, clearly aggravated and getting all the angrier when Bias scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seriously? The leaders of Agartha are all gathered in this one place. If we choose one of our number to be the new Agastya, then it’s as official as it gets,” she complained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Should I take that as a sign of your support?” Cleobulus inquired with another smirk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You might as well. I can’t say I give much of a shit. I have a deal with Myson anyway, so his interests are my interests, as long as he upholds his end.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you have my oath that I will,” Myson stated with a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good. So long as you keep up your deal, and I get to kill the Fell Star, we won’t have any issues.” Bias paused, then ignored an irritated noise from Chilon before she continued. “Speaking of our ‘age old enemy’, I should mention she has a sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?!” Chilon exclaimed, “You mean there are two of them!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, idiot. She adopted a girl that was once one of our experiments," Bias explained, "Solon thought the brat was a failure, but it turns out he was wrong." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, the source of the samples then,” Myson noted, amused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What samples?” Cleobulus asked, somewhat annoyed to be out of the loop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Samples of a project that was meant to house the power of Epimenides, though it appears that isn’t quite what happened. Or, to be clear, it seems our wayward experiment gained more than merely his power.” Myson smirked. “She's the vessel of the great sage." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tent went silent, before Cleobulus laughed outright. “Haha! Good gods long dead, the fates really do have the most baffling senses of humor~!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t funny!” Chilon snapped, “Are you serious?! The great sage Epimenides is trapped in the body of some wayward failure?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s clearly not a failure if she’s his vessel,” Myson pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not a failure at all if that’s the metric,” Bias added, “Though it doesn’t seem to be a complete reincarnation. The sage was possessing her when he spoke to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? This is new information.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t expect anything special. He taught me the spell of Zahras so I could deal with the Fell Star, nothing more.” Well, that and a few things she was keeping back in case they came in handy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So he’d be willing to help us?” Cleobulus asked, curious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can’t be serious!” Chilon snapped, angered, “Even if the sage possesses that filth, the fact that it dared to call the Fell Star kin makes it a disgusting failure!” His voice lowered in a mix of disgust and contempt. “And failures are to be disposed of.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You really know how to bring down the mood,” Cleobulus complained, before glancing at Myson and Bias, “So? Can the little doll be recruited?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I doubt it,” Bias answered, “The mutt loves the Fell Star. She’ll hate me at the very least, though I doubt giving her my head will bring her to our side.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please, as though we’d want that thing anyway,” Myson scoffed, “Even if the vessel is perfect, splattering it with paint will mar it all the same. Better I just make a clean version while we dispose of the wretch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would your ‘clean version’ also hold the mind of Epimenides?” Cleobulus questioned, audibly interested in the idea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t see why it can’t. If it was done once, it can be done again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cleobulus nodded before sitting back with a smirk. “Then so shall it be~. We kill the wayward child and make a better vessel! In fact…let’s see if we can use her corpse to help things along.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re going after her then?” Bias asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In response, she received a smirk. “Not </span>
  <em>
    <span>just</span>
  </em>
  <span> her, my adorably aggressive sage~ We’re going to put that entire monastery to the pyre! So I hope you can help with that, Sage of Fire~.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Why did you rhyme that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because I wanted to. Speaking of sages, we’ve been missing a few positions lately, and it’s about time we fill them out.” She smiled, pretending to be sweet. “So, do we have any recommendations~?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Odesse has always been dutiful. We can make him the new Sage of Wind to fill out an empty spot,” Myson recommended, earning a glare from Bias at the prospect of her sister’s position being filled, “Oh don’t look like that. It wasn’t as though wind sage was even that fitting a title for her. I recall she was always better at light magic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We really should change the names at some point,” Cleobulus noted, “Sage of Water doesn’t exactly fit me either, now does it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Those titles are important positions that have existed for–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Chilon, shut up,” Bias demanded, before looking at the two that actually mattered, “So who gets Darkness and Light, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Those positions can’t just be </span>
  <em>
    <span>assigned</span>
  </em>
  <span>–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t mind being called the Sage of Darkness in addition to being Agastya,” Cleobulus remarked, amused by Chilon’s outrage, “I’ve always been best with those types of spells to begin with~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then that leaves Water and Light to be filled,” Myson noted, “Hm…We could always make Anaximandros the Sage of Light.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True, he does like to consider himself Thales’s apprentice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought he hated him,” Bias remarked, earning a dismissive wave from Cleobulus.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but no one really liked Thales to begin with. Authority breeds resentment. Who would we have for Water then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…Dolofonos?” Myson offered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The noise Chilon made could only be described as outraged. “You would let a mere assassin be a sage?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then we can give it to Agnus or Kyrie.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Who!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Members of my research team. I keep them around in case I need a new Odesse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You cannot just hand off the rank of sage to whoever you want!” Chilon snapped, “These are important positions to our people! To be the Sage of Light is to be our great leader, to be the Sage of Darkness is to be our leading scientist, to be a sage is to be a guardian to our people–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I second Myson’s suggestion,” Cleobulus chimed in, taking obvious pleasure in Chilon’s mounting frustration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll third it,” Bias offered, which made Chilon outright growl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Motion passed then,” Myson decided with open amusement, “Anaximandros shall be our Sage of Light, though not Agastya, Odesse will be the Sage of Wind, and…ah, I suppose we didn’t decide specifically on who it should be…Oh well, Bias, be a dear and find Anaximandros and the first Dolofonos you see." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're just–" Was all Bias heard Chilon say before leaving the tent, not wanting to hear anything else from him. She already had enough to deal with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Watching her breath mist out as she stared up at the sky, Bias wondered what life she would lead once she had her sister again. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Rhea was running out of time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The end of the year drifted ever closer, the rivers of time flowing steadily and without pause. She wanted…She </span>
  <em>
    <span>needed</span>
  </em>
  <span> to bring her mother back into the world, and yet…Byleth showed no sign of her mother’s power. She thought there would be something, some indication that the goddess dwelled within her vessel, but there was nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her hair remained the same bluish shade, her body remained unaltered, and she hadn’t even regrown the eye she lost. She was still…just Byleth. And that…Rhea didn’t know how to deal with that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To make matters worse, the Agarthans were plainly on the move again. It was the only explanation for the rumors of demonic beasts in Ordelia alongside knights with strange powers. And, speaking of knights…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took a slow breath as she looked over the railing of the Star Terrace. She hadn’t heard anything yet from Catherine, Alois, or Shamir. Hopefully there would be something; she’d sent another three battalions to help support Leicester’s forces, under orders to reinforce Gloucester and rescue their lost comrades. Or retrieve them, if they were not…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She should try to remain optimistic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If she wasn’t then she would break, and she needed to remain strong for Fodlan and her mother. Sighing, she shook her head, deciding she needed to go for a walk. Though as she did, she couldn’t help but notice how quiet it was at the monastery. Not only were a large number of her knights away, but several students and staff had left throughout the year. She only prayed that the ones who weren't traitors were doing well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though as she shook herself out of her thoughts, she realized she was standing in front of the dorms. The dorm of one person in particular. Bringing her hand up, she knocked on the door.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Give me a moment,” Byleth called out, and Rhea only had to wait for a few seconds before the door opened. “Oh, Lady Rhea, is everything okay?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I just wished to see how you were fairing, young one,” Rhea said, doing her best to smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“About as well as I can be, I suppose,” Byleth replied as Rhea glanced into her room, and noticed what seemed to be a letter on her desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, my apologies, were you writing something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yeah. A letter to her majesty,” Byleth explained, rubbing the back of her head. “I just wanted to let her know that everything is okay at the monastery.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, and that’s why you’re already on your tenth rewrite,” Sothis chimed in, while Byleth pointedly ignored her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I see.” Rhea nodded, keeping her expression positive despite the reminder of why she felt so concerned for the future. “You truly do care a great deal for Emperor Edelgard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I do,” she answered quite simply and earnestly. "I care for everyone here but as the former class leader, she's helped me as much as I've helped her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…oh, would you like to walk with me?" Rhea asked, not wanting to stand at the doorway. Nodding in response, Byleth walked alongside her, the pair aimlessly wandering around. "If I may, what exactly made you consider working for the Empire?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…it was a few days before the Battle of Eagle and Lion. Edelgard and I talked about what she was going to do when she was Emperor. There's still things I don't understand, things I need to talk to her about, but…I want to be able to support her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so?" Rhea muttered in response before thinking. "You know, there was a young man I knew from the Empire. A nobleman. He also had grand ideals for what he wanted for Adrestia. He also supported me as much as I supported him." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...is he…?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea had a moment's pause before getting her implication. "N-No, it wasn't meant to be. When it came down to it, I chose the church over him. Duty trumped over heart for me." Despite her falter there, Rhea did feel sorrow in her as she remembered Wilhelm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Do you regret it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There are many things I regret. Even so, I do not dwell on them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth glanced up at her, remaining silent as she took in her words. Rhea wondered if her advice of duty over heart would be one Byleth agreed with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth, meanwhile, couldn't help but wonder if Rhea knew she had feelings for Edelgard and was telling her not to choose duty over heart. She clearly regretted not going with her boyfriend and joining the church instead, so it would make sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll make sure to keep your words in mind," Byleth said, completely misunderstanding the advice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good, I’m glad that you will.” Rhea continued her walk with Byleth, content to let things subside into silence for a moment as they simply walked around the paths of the monastery. “...how have things been going with your classes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well enough. It’s still weird going around with half my vision gone, but I’m managing. Ferdinand’s been doing well as the new house leader too. I think he’s trying to live up to Edelgard’s example.” She smiled. “It’s funny, Flayn actually decided she wanted to be his retainer, like how Hubert was Edelgard’s.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? She hasn’t mentioned it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well she’s been doing well in the position. Constance got annoyed that Ferdinand didn’t ask her, but considering she tried to start a coup against him, I think it was a good idea in hindsight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...She did what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it was a whole thing. It’s probably a good thing it happened so late in the year, otherwise she might have seceded and then we’d have four classes. Then I would have had to deal with teaching two classes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...what.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth suddenly paused, a thoughtful look coming to her face. “Hm. Hey, Rhea, who is my mother’s father? If it wasn’t the guy you mentioned.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…I would prefer not to talk about him," Rhea said, internally panicking since she didn't think Byleth would outright ask…was it too late to say it was an immaculate birth? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Did something bad happen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…yes. He…died. Violently.” The instant she said it, Rhea felt like hiding her face in her hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hey, Lady Rhea, you don’t need to tell me if you don’t want to,” Byleth said, concern now audible in her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea sighed. “Truthfully, young one…I don’t remember your mother’s father,” she lied, trying to hide her discomfort as she did, “I had experienced a personal tragedy, so I sought comfort in drink. And…the arms of another.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The best lies had grains of truth in them. When she was Seiros, rage and purpose had suffused her being, a drive to destroy all that Nemesis had built and return the world to the peace she had known as a child. Yet fury could not keep her going at all times. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She never drowned her sorrows, though she might have wished to. And she never fully embraced Wilhelm, even if the urge was there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...It could have been Will. In another life, I might have married him. But I did not. And thus, here we are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'm sorry for bringing up bad memories, Lady Rhea," Byleth apologized, her gaze drifting to the ground for a moment, "...For what it's worth, even if it was a mistake, I'm sure mom was happy. Even if she didn't get to see the world, she had you, papa, and even Aelfric." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I could have done more for her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Papa's like that as well sometimes. Take it from me, you did enough," Byleth said, smiling up at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You are a kind child,” Rhea replied, returning the smile, “I wish…I wish a number of things had been different. Yet we cannot change the flow of time, try as we might." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Lady Rhea, may I ask something?" At her nod, Byleth took in a breath. "My mama…did she ever dream of a little girl?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth, what are you doing?" Sothis asked, getting Byleth to glance at her for a moment. She decided to press on though, keeping her eyes on her grandmother.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I sometimes have dreams of a young girl, with long green hair sleeping on a throne. Did mama mention anything like that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea froze. “A girl? A girl with green hair–You have dreams about a girl with green hair?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I do. I’ve had them since I was young.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...a girl. How…How old does she seem to be?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned faintly, resisting the urge to glance at Sothis to check. “Ten, maybe twelve?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“About half your age then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think so. Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea felt like sighing. She also felt like cheering or maybe even screaming. She was feeling a lot of things at the moment, and one of them was her mentally cursing herself for forgetting the extremely basic fact of her own species biology. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Nabateans mature slower than humans, how in the world did I not realize–</span>
  </em>
  <span> “I…That is…Has anything happened in these dreams? You said she was sleeping. Has she ever been awake?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For some reason, Byleth felt a sense of dread at the question. "...N-No, she, um…sometimes seems like she's stirring?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. Of course, I should have realized…” Rhea murmured, frowning in thought as she looked away from Byleth, “This whole time…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is something wrong?” Byleth asked, still feeling strangely nervous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, not at all. Everything is perfect," Rhes said, smiling as she stared at Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth felt as if she wasn't smiling at her. “...I think I should get back to my room now. I still need to finish that letter. And I should get some rest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Actually, professor, do you think you could come with me?” Rhea requested, still smiling at something only she could see, “It has to do with our family.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...what do you mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean as I say. I have something to show you that I believe will answer a number of questions you have about our family and our people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned. “Can’t you just tell me what you want to show me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It would be easier to show you. A painting is worth more than mere words, and there are some secrets that need to be unveiled directly for them to be understood.” She smiled. “I promise, it will not take long. You can come back and write your letter right afterward." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do not go with her," Sothis urged, and Byleth felt herself agreeing immediately.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe we can go tomorrow?" Byleth asked, as she took a step back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There's no need to worry. I swear to you I only want what's best for you and our people." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why do you keep saying ‘our people’?" Byleth asked, feeling uneasy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is what I want to explain to you. The truth about </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span>. About me, about your mother, about </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rhea said, gesturing towards Byleth with a genuine smile that just made the professor all the more unnerved, “I want to share it all with you. You’ll understand everything once your eyes are opened to the truth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There you are, Rhea.” Both women paused in their tracks as a familiar voice cut through the tension, before they turned their gazes to Jeralt, who raised an eyebrow at the sight of Rhea and his daughter. “...Is something going on here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Jeralt–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi Papa,” Byleth greeted, moving away from Rhea and promptly hugging Jeralt, earning a blink from the knight captain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hey kid. Wasn’t expecting you to be so huggy,” he replied, wrapping his arms around his daughter with a small smile, before looking over at Rhea. “What were you two talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Nothing important. I was taking a walk with Byleth and asking her about her classes,” Rhea answered, frowning faintly as Byleth gave her a glance, her gaze questioning. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Perhaps I shouldn’t have lied immediately. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“Did you need something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Underneath that question was another one. Namely, did he interrupt them deliberately?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, actually. A messenger from Faerghus showed up. Apparently the regent wants to visit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea blinked, genuinely caught off guard by that answer. “He does? For what reason?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“From what the messenger said, he has some information about the ‘cult’ we’ve been having trouble with. The one that he’s pretty sure has taken over Ordelia, and might be causing problems in the Kingdom.” He shrugged, keeping his hand on Byleth’s shoulder. “I figure the letter has more information about it, but he wanted that passed along as soon as possible. Along with one more request. He’d like the new emperor to be at the meeting too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” To Jeralt’s surprised, it wasn’t Rhea that spoke, but Byleth. “Why would he want her here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure, kid. Could be a lot of reasons. Maybe it’s a power play, or maybe he’s serious about there being a big threat.” He glanced at the archbishop. “It’s up to you, Rhea. If we do go along with this, we’ll be hosting two royals at once, and not just princes and princesses. We’re talking about the current rulers of two nations being here while we have most of our forces trying to handle the Ordelia Crisis.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Rhea glanced at Byleth, before taking a small breath. She wanted nothing more than to have her mother back, but if the Agarthans truly were behind all this, she needed to make sure nothing could harm her. "Very well, have a missive sent to Emperor Edelgard."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She's waited for a millenia for her mother to return. She could wait a few more days for her dream to be achieved. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Edelgard von Hresvelg was a busy woman; as the newly instated Emperor she had far too many projects to start and plans to prepare for her reforms to take place. So when she received a letter from the archbishop asking for her presence at the monastery, she almost declined on the spot. After all, what kind of Emperor would she be if she came scurrying at Rhea’s beck and call? </p><p> </p><p>When she received Byleth’s letter asking for her to come back to the Academy, however, she immediately began preparations to go. </p><p> </p><p>Now she would of course say it was because the letter informed her that Rhea was planning something. What exactly she was planning was unknown, but her teacher made it clear that if need be, she would be leaving the monastery early with the Emperor. So clearly it made sense for her to go and help her. </p><p> </p><p>For Hubert and Monica, however, it was obvious she just wanted to see her professor again. </p><p> </p><p>Regardless, this was still an official diplomatic meeting, so Edelgard prepared herself. Dressed in the fine crimson of Adrestia, Edelgard looked like she was ready to fight a war instead of attending a political meeting. Though as well-crafted as her clothes were, she had to admit, she enjoyed the horned crown she wore on her head far more.</p><p> </p><p>After all, who else could say they had a crown forged to resemble their enemies horns to symbolically make it her own? Of course, it wasn’t quite the full armored and padded war gown she wanted to have, but it was close in style. She still needed to get a cape, and it bared more of her shoulders and back than intended for the final design, but for now it would serve its function.</p><p> </p><p>"I must admit, I've returned far sooner than I had imagined. I wasn't even sure if I would be back for the graduation ceremony." Edelgard mused, looking out the window as her carriage began to pull into Garreg Mach. </p><p> </p><p>"It's a shame we won't be able to stay for long," Monica noted, looking outside as well. </p><p> </p><p>"For the best, especially given the professor's apparent request," Hubert remarked as he closed a book he was reading. </p><p> </p><p>"Whatever it is that Rhea is planning, we must be careful. I trust you two can handle ensuring the professor gets out safely while I speak to Rhea?" Edelgard asked, glancing at her friends. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course." </p><p> </p><p>"Leave it to us!" </p><p> </p><p>Smiling at their prompt responses, Edelgard felt the carriage come to a stop. Getting up when Monica opened the door for her, she walked down, prepared for whatever happened. </p><p> </p><p>"Edie!" She didn't expect Dorothea to come running up, practically tackling her in a hug. Thankfully Edelgard was able to keep herself standing upright as she caught the taller woman. While also trying to ignore what was pressing up against her face right now. "Oh wow, you're certainly dressed for the occasion." </p><p> </p><p>"H-Hm, yes, it's only befitting my position," Edelgard responded, blushing as Dorothea backed away, plainly checking out her outfit. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll say! You look gorgeous in that! And the horned crown looks really fierce on you~”</p><p> </p><p>“Good, I was hoping to give that impression. Better to put a firm foot forward in whatever negotiations Rufus has planned.”</p><p> </p><p>"Right, I heard about that. Funny, you'd think the person asking for the meeting would show up early," Dorothea said, letting out a huff, "The Blue Lions don't even know when he's showing up." </p><p> </p><p>“They don’t?” She frowned. “Not even Dimitri?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not from what I heard. I know he should be here, but–Oh, wait, here’s something more important,” Dorothea interrupted herself, grinning as she spotted a certain professor walking towards them. </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard, meanwhile, blinked because her professor appeared to have her arms full of at least five bouquets of flowers. “...hm. I see she’s happy I’m visiting.”</p><p> </p><p>"Hello there, Emperor Edelgard," Byleth greeted, smiling at her. The two stared at one another, silent for the moment. Neither was quite sure what to say next. "...So, um, I got these for you. And one for Hubert and Monica as well." </p><p> </p><p>Saying this, she handed out three of the five bouquets. Edelgard had to admit, it was…interesting seeing how nervous her professor was right now. </p><p> </p><p>"And the other two?" Hubert asked, far too amused right now. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…um…one for Dorothea too," Byleth said, handing it over to the songstress. "And...I guess I have one extra, so you can have it as well, Edelgard." </p><p> </p><p>“...Mm. Thank you, professor,” Edelgard responded with a smile, holding the two bouquets close to her chest, “...Ah, so, how have things been?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well enough. Rhea scares me now.” Byleth’s blunt statement got Edelgard to stare at her in surprise. </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'll explain in a bit. We should go somewhere private," Byleth suggested, before turning around and walking away. </p><p> </p><p>“...I suppose I’ll be following Professor Byleth then,” Edelgard noted, before turning to her retainers, “Monica, please alert Seteth to our presence and let him know I will be right with the archbishop. Hubert, keep watch so no one eavesdrops or attempts to interrupt us.”</p><p> </p><p>“At once, Lady Edelgard!”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, your majesty.”</p><p> </p><p>With their responses given, she turned to Dorothea, only to pause when the songstress gave her a kiss on the cheek. “Have fun with Bylie~ Oh and be careful with Rhea. I don’t know what she wants exactly, but it’s enough to worry our professor.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be careful. Thank you for the concern,” she replied with a smile of her own, before giving Dorothea a kiss on the cheek in turn.</p><p> </p><p>“Heh. Someone’s gotten bolder~”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m an emperor. Remaining a blushing schoolgirl would be foolish of me.” With that said, on she went to follow her professor into a secluded part of the monastery. And to her surprise, another person happened to be waiting for them. Though perhaps she shouldn’t have been that surprised. “Oh, hello Shez.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey.” Shez, who was leaning against the wall in the store room with her arms crossed, possibly in some attempt to look intimidating or cool, raised a hand in greeting. “So…uh…alright, I’m going to just get this over with. I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I must admit, I didn’t expect to hear that.” </p><p> </p><p>“Look, I still have problems with you, but I talked to Kronya, and well, I don't want to be a hypocrite.” </p><p> </p><p>“I see. Well, I want to apologize as well. My actions put you and the professor in danger, and I will forever regret doing that to you two.” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah yeah, you can save the apologies. I’m still not happy with you taking Byleth from me.” </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Edelgard and Byleth said in unison. </p><p> </p><p>“What? Nothing. Shut up. I’m not upset.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard, despite the situation, felt a small smile creep up her face. “Didn’t you give me your blessing to marry Byleth before, Shez?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked at that while Shez stiffened. “That–That was said before she almost died and now I feel weird about it, so shut up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah–My apologies, I didn’t–”</p><p> </p><p>“Look, just, Byleth has things to tell you about Rhea being weird, so…yeah. Listen to her. Not me. Well, aside from when I agree with her about how we need to get out of Garreg Mach and maybe smuggle her in your carriage. Speaking of, do you have secret compartments in there or do I need to carve one?”</p><p> </p><p>“...The carriage has a secret compartment under one of the seats.” </p><p> </p><p>“Wait, really?” Byleth asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, it was prepared if we ever needed to smuggle something. Though I doubt Hubert would have expected it to be a live human.”</p><p> </p><p>“It can fit a fully grown human body,” Hubert commented from the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, can it fit two?” Shez asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Not without effort. And perhaps a saw.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, damn.”</p><p> </p><p>“Couldn’t you just warp after us?” Byleth asked, giving her sister a confused look.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I can. I was thinking Dorothea would be in the compartment with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“That sounds uncomfortable.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you’re saying you don’t want to be up close and personal with Dorothea for a long stretch of time?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not while we’re in an enclosed space and attempting to travel without being detected.”</p><p> </p><p>“Dorothea is an Adrestian citizen,” Hubert pointed out, “We can have her ride in the carriage with just about any excuse.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but that’s not as fun,” Shez complained.</p><p> </p><p>“Before we continue any plans, can someone please tell me what Rhea is planning?”</p><p> </p><p>“...That’s the thing, I'm not exactly sure. I was talking to her a few days ago and…do you remember that ability I mentioned having?” At her nod, Byleth continued. “I mentioned something along those lines to Rhea and…it was like she was no longer looking at me. As if I didn’t exist any more, and…she kept mentioning something about ‘our family’, as if it was some massive secret she held.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard glanced at Hubert for a moment. “I see…my teacher, for the sake of honesty, there is something I haven’t mentioned which I believe is what Rhea wished to tell you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course you know.” Shez huffed. </p><p> </p><p>“Shez.” Byleth frowned at her sister.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not saying anything! Bleh, okay, so what’s the secret you know this time and never told anybody?”</p><p> </p><p>“Shez…”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you use a sad voice, you know I’m weak to that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rhea isn’t her true name,” Edelgard stated, deciding to cut through the byplay, “Her true name is Seiros. Or, perhaps more accurately, the Immaculate One.”</p><p> </p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>“...That’s a stupid name,” Shez commented, frowning, “Why is her being clean so important?”</p><p> </p><p>“The Immaculate One is the name of the divine beast that allegedly aided the saints during the war against the King of Liberation,” Edelgard explained, ignoring that, “More accurately, it is the name of a dragon.”  </p><p> </p><p>“...is that what she meant by ‘our people’?” Byleth murmured, frowning to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, hang on, Byleth’s a dragon!?” Shez exclaimed, her eyes going wide, “How does that work?! She doesn’t have scales, I know that much!”</p><p> </p><p>“She wouldn’t,” Edelgard commented, “From what I know of Rhea’s kind, they have two forms, human and dragon. Though the humanoid form is noted to have green hair, green eyes, and pointed ears.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. But my hair is blue? And I don’t have pointed ears,” Byleth pointed out, brushing back her hair to show her lack of pointed ears.</p><p> </p><p>“True. But you also have a human father,” Edelgard noted, getting Byleth to pause before her attention was caught by Shez letting out a sudden gasp.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh shit, Seteth and Flayn are dragons.”</p><p> </p><p>“...oh.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, that is our assumption as well,” Edelgard agreed, nodding to Shez, “We also presume the two of them are likely Saints Cichol and Cethleann, given their status as father and daughter.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, hang on, Flayn’s tiny! She’s young too! How is she–”</p><p> </p><p>“Is she young? Or does she just look young?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez looked at Byleth, bewildered and worried.</p><p> </p><p>And Byleth…Byleth was thinking about a lot of things at once. Like the question of how her mother’s body was intact after years of being dead. Or how Rhea directly stated her mother gave her heart to her. Which didn’t make sense…if she was human. But if she wasn’t…</p><p> </p><p>She felt her chest. Her heart still didn’t beat. But what if it wasn’t a human heart? Did Rhea’s heart beat? Did Seteth’s? Flayn’s?</p><p> </p><p>And…And then there was what Bias said. That she was the Fell Star, that she was a vessel, and Byleth felt dizzy as her mind started making connections because Seiros started the church, the Immaculate One was a servant of the goddess, Sothis was the <em> name of the goddess </em>– “That’s why. That’s what she wants. Rhea wants me to be the vessel of the goddess.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Edelgard stared at her professor, her eyes wide. “What are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>“Bias, she–She knew, how did she know? She knew–She called me empty, an empty vessel for–”</p><p> </p><p>“H-Hey, By!” </p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked, feeling Shez’s arms holding her up. “...I’m okay, I’m alright, I just…why didn’t I think about this earlier? The pieces were all there…” She looked up at Sothis, floating at her side as always. And yet, the spirit’s gaze was different from usual. Her usual immaturity wasn’t there; instead, there was a sort of resigned acceptance. “...did you know?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, of course not,” Edelgard answered, thinking Byleth was talking to her while her own mind raced with the sudden information, “Professor, what did you mean? About Rhea wanting you to be–”</p><p> </p><p>“Lady Edelgard?” Edelgard nearly cursed, turning to see Monica, who looked apologetic. “Ah, Rhea wants you up at her antechamber as soon as possible. She sent Gilbert to help escort you and I don’t know if I can distract him–”</p><p> </p><p>“No, that’s fine. I’ll go with him,” she decided, before looking at the Eisner sisters, “Professor, are you going to be alright?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I think. I think I need to think about…things.” Byleth sighed, putting a hand to her aching head.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I’m sure you can just rest for a while, right?” Shez looked at the former Eagles. “We can meet up with you guys later. I’ll get Byleth back to her room, she can rest, and then I’ll figure out whatever we gotta do to get out of here, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“That sounds good to me,” Edelgard agreed, nodding to her, “We can discuss Rhea’s intentions once we have Professor Byleth in a safe place. I have to imagine I can make the excuse of wanting to meet up with our classmates if we need an excuse.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, yeah, that works. I mean, hey, they probably would’ve been over here already if Dorothea didn’t ask them to give her some private time with you,” Shez remarked.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, I'll make sure to thank her later," Edelgard said, before glancing at Byleth, "I still don't understand what you mean about Rhea attempting to make you into a vessel, but I promise you I won't let her harm you, my teacher." </p><p> </p><p>"...Thank you, Edelgard," Byleth replied, though she still looked stressed. Nodding to her, Edelgard left, prepared for whatever was to come. </p><p> </p><p>"Alright come on, let's get you to a bed," Shez said, helping Byleth walk as they went to the dorms. "As fun as it would be to start smuggling you, it probably won't be comfy in a secret compartment." </p><p> </p><p>"Probably not," Byleth agreed, feeling exhausted as they left the store room. Glancing up as they walked, she couldn't help but note how foggy the sky had suddenly gotten. </p><hr /><p>It was strange being back in the Archbishop’s audience chambers. Edelgard hadn’t thought she’d be back in this room anytime soon, and it did grate at her pride somewhat to be here at the archbishop’s command, as though the woman still had power over her.</p><p> </p><p>Still, she’d pretended for long enough; she could keep up a farce for a little longer.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, there you are, Emperor Edelgard," the Archbishop greeted as she walked in. She wasn’t alone, as expected; a few Knights of Seiros stood nearby as guards for the meeting.</p><p> </p><p>"Greetings, Lady Rhea. My apologies for my tardiness, I wished to catch up with my classmates and lost track of the time." Giving a slight bow, Edelgard couldn't help but notice how, beneath her usual calm, the archbishop seemed annoyed. Maybe impatient?</p><p> </p><p>If she did intend for Professor Byleth to be used as a vessel of the goddess, perhaps she wanted to get whatever ritual she needed to perform over with sooner rather than later? The cynical part of her found it hard to believe, though not because she thought Rhea wouldn’t readily sacrifice the professor for her own ends; no, she was just surprised that Rhea was a genuine adherent of the false religion she had concocted.</p><p> </p><p>"I see. I can understand wanting to see your friends again, but you really should at least inform me beforehand," Rhea responded, some of that annoyance showing.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course." Edelgard made a show of glancing around. “Is Lord Rufus here as well, or…?</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. He also appears to be tardy. And unlike you, I haven’t received word of his arrival at all yet, which is–”</p><p> </p><p>She paused as the doors to the antechamber opened again and Gilbert walked in, alongside a man that certainly wasn’t the regent Archduke Rufus Thierry Blaiddyd. Instead, the man that came in didn’t look particularly noteworthy at all; he dressed like a priest, though in Kingdom Blue instead of Seiros White, and his features were decidedly average, with his hair being the most common shade of light brown found in Fodlan.</p><p> </p><p>“And who might you be?” Rhea asked, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>"My name is Miles, Lady Rhea, and I am the Kingdom’s representative at this meeting.” The man smiled, and for some reason, it seemed uncomfortably familiar to Edelgard. “I bring a missive from his majesty regarding some very important issues he would like to bring to your attention, Lady Rhea, and Emperor Edelgard.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then why isn’t he here himself?” Rhea demanded, her irritation obvious, “Rufus asked for this meeting, he stated he would be here, so where is he?”</p><p> </p><p>“His majesty is a busy man, Lady Rhea,” Miles answered, “He is ruling an entire nation, and cannot be drawn away by a mere meeting when a representative could suffice.”</p><p> </p><p>“Miles, was it?” Gilbert spoke up, frowning at him, “You’re overstepping your boundaries here. Rufus is the regent of Faerghus, not its king, and he cannot ignore the summons of the archbishop.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, of course, I am getting ahead of myself. And I must say, I am grateful to see Emperor Edelgard came to this meeting herself.” He smirked, turning his gaze to her. “If I may say so, you appear quite confident to leave your empire unattended. I do hope your ministers are able to handle the unrest without your presence.”</p><p> </p><p>His tone was polite, but the words were targeted. Edelgard’s gaze was cool as she regarded the Kingdom’s messenger. “I assure you, my ministers will be able to handle things without issue. They are capable of working without a leader guiding their every move.”</p><p> </p><p>“That is true, though you are a newly established leader. It is understandable to be concerned for your leadership when you haven’t truly proven yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard narrowed her eyes. “I have better things to do than trade barbs with a messenger. Tell us your missive or leave." </p><p> </p><p>"Very well." With a grin, the priest took out a scroll from his sleeve. "On behalf of <em> King </em> Rufus Thierry Blaiddyd, I bring a message to Archbishop Rhea." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s eyes narrowed as he spoke. Rufus was meant to be the regent, not the king. Just what had occurred in the kingdom? </p><p> </p><p>"After much investigation, we of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus have discovered that the true culprits behind the Tragedy of Duscur is the Empire. Specifically, the deceased Volkhard von Arundel, his sister Anselma von Arundel, otherwise known as the current emperor’s mother, and the former Prime Minister, Duke Ludwig von Aegir. As such, we demand that the students of the Black Eagle house be turned over to the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus as wards of his majesty and his appointed council. As well, due to her connection to the proven conspirators, we demand Emperor Edelgard step down and cede power to a regent appointed by the Holy Kingdom." </p><p> </p><p>"What!?" Miles paid Edelgard no attention as he continued. </p><p> </p><p>"Furthermore, because of the church’s gross negligence in management, such as allowing  several infiltrators to roam free within the monastery, executing loyal knights of Faerghus under false pretenses, and failing to ensure the safety of the students of the kingdom, or even your own staff, his majesty rightly believes you, Lady Rhea, are no longer suited to hold the position of archbishop." He gave Rhea a small smirk. “There is also, of course, the matter of you having a child out of wedlock. I believe your granddaughter, who you so eagerly gave the position of professor at the Academy, is proof enough of your indecency. It is his majesty’s belief that no true representative of the goddess could have such loose morals as to rut like a beast and bear a sickly bastard who only had the decency to die after bearing her own wretched spawn.”</p><p> </p><p>In the past few seconds, Rhea had gone from shocked, to offended, to visibly outraged. By the end of his sentence, her face had darkened with rage and she was plainly holding herself back from ordering Miles killed on the spot by the bristling knights standing guard. Or killing him herself, if it came down to it.</p><p> </p><p>“I see.” The anger was still there, but her tone turned cold as she addressed the messenger. “Miles, was it?”</p><p> </p><p>“That is correct, Lady Rhea,” he replied.</p><p> </p><p>“Miles, then. I understand you are a messenger. As such, I will refrain from ordering your execution for the heresy that has spilled from your lips. You are, however, excommunicated from the Church of Seiros. You are barred from all institutions of the church, and you have forfeited your rights to trial. If ever you are caught committing a crime by a Knight of Seiros, they have leave to execute you on the spot.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Furthermore </em> ,” she echoed, “The same extends to Rufus Thierry Blaiddyd and the members of his ‘council’. I will also add that he is to be removed from the throne of Faerghus and exiled from the lands of Fodlan by the end of the week, or the nation of Faerghus shall be recognized as illegitimate and all lands and titles will be stripped from its nobility and returned to the Empire of Adrestia, which shall have the full support of the Central Church in retaking its <em> stolen </em> lands.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s eyes were wide as she stared at the archbishop. A part of her was baffled that it could be that easy to just completely eliminate Faerghus as a legitimate nation, while another was considering just how to take advantage of the archbishop’s rage.</p><p> </p><p>And yet…could she even pretend to be siding with Rhea when Byleth needed her to get out from under her thumb?</p><p> </p><p>That decision could be left for later though as Rhea spoke again. “Emperor Edelgard will serve as witness of my orders and they will be shared among the Knights of Seiros once our conversation ceases. Am I understood?”</p><p> </p><p>“Perfectly,” Miles replied with a surprising lack of concern. The man’s expression hadn’t changed at all. “You have chosen to ignore the lawful orders of King Rufus.” His smile widened. “And like that, the war begins.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wha–War?! You dare threaten war when that usurper makes demands of those chosen by the goddess?!” Rhea snapped, letting her anger show.</p><p> </p><p>“I do not threaten war, abomination. Our war has already begun.” Miles clapped his hands together, his grin threatening to split his cheeks. “It started over a thousand years ago, though I would say it’s only now that you have personally started a war with the festering sore called the Holy Kingdom. Oh, but where are my manners? I’ve been lying to you this whole time and here I am, forgetting to introduce myself properly.”</p><p> </p><p>He placed a hand on his chest as dark magic burst up around him in a torrent, pushing Edelgard, Rhea, and all the knights back while his disguise burned away, leaving a pale-skinned warlock with a faint beard standing in the archbishop’s audience chambers. “I am Myson of Agartha, the Storm Sage of Shambhala, and I thank you for your hospitality, you filthy beasts.”</p><p> </p><p>Then he turned his gaze towards Edelgard and she felt herself stiffen at the gleam of familiar yellow eyes in the shadows of his hat. “You’ve certainly grown from that time in the dungeons, little Edelgard.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard went rigid, though she snapped out of it quickly when Rhea screamed in rage, “KILL HIM! DO NOT LET THAT MAN LEAVE HERE ALIVE!”</p><p> </p><p>The knights leapt to obey the archbishop’s orders, drawing swords and charging as Myson smirked, before he vanished in a flash of magic right before the blades could slice his body. </p><p> </p><p>"I WANT ALL THE KNIGHTS AT THE MONASTERY TO BEGIN SEARCHING FOR HIM, AND SEND A MESSAGE TO THE KNIGHTS IN THE ALLIANCE TO RETURN AT ONCE!" Rhea demanded as the knights immediately moved, bursting out of the room and nearly knocking over Monica and Hubert.</p><p> </p><p>"Your majesty, what happened?" Hubert asked once the pair of retainers entered the room. </p><p> </p><p>"Quickly, gather all the Black Eagles! The kingdom is demanding we hand them over, so we have to make sure none of them get taken!" Edelgard ordered her two retainers who immediately snapped to attention. "Lady Rhea, if they really have declared war, you need to ensure your knights are ready to mount a defense first and foremost!" </p><p> </p><p>“DO NOT–No, you’re right, we need to be ready.” Rhea nodded sharply. “Even if they have declared war, the Kingdom’s army will need time to–”</p><p> </p><p>“LADY RHEA!” A knight shouted, pushing his way into the room in a genuine panic. “There’s an army outside the walls!”</p><p> </p><p><em> What the hell is happening? </em>Edelgard couldn’t help but think as Rhea’s eyes went wide.</p><hr /><p>“So…how long have you known?” Byleth asked within the void of her own mind, staring at Sothis as she reclined on her throne.</p><p> </p><p>“It would not be exactly accurate to say from the moment Bias claimed that you were a vessel of a ‘False God’,” the Goddess of Fodlan answered, “But that is when things began to finally make sense for me. And over the past month…I would say it all began to slowly fall into place. Memories of a life I once lived, of powers I wielded, of children I had…” She sighed. “It has been…interesting.”</p><p> </p><p>"So…what now?" Byleth asked, looking at Sothis. "Are you going to take my body?"</p><p> </p><p>"No. I don't know what kind of person I was but…I was not the type of person to ask for someone to sacrifice themselves so I can walk the land," Sothis said, before sighing, "At least, I hope I wasn’t." </p><p> </p><p>"What do you remember?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I think Rhea was my youngest. I made several children, and I cared for them, yet she was the one who always stood by my side. She might blame herself for whatever happened to me."</p><p> </p><p>“And…what happened?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” she stated quite simply, “I am more aware of who I once was, but I do not remember everything. Part of the problem is that I am…far longer lived than I realized.” She smiled wistfully, leaning back and looking at the “sky” of the void. “I traveled among the stars once. I settled here. I was welcomed. I think I was, at least. If Bias is any indication, there were those who did not appreciate my presence.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. And…I’m descended from one of your children?”</p><p> </p><p>“That does appear to be the case. Rhea, Seiros, the Immaculate One…whatever she chooses to call herself now, she is at least responsible for your mother’s existence. Though the fact that you have my heart, and by extension your mother must have had it as well, worries me.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked. “I have your heart?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the only explanation I can think of for why I am a part of you. And why my bones react to your presence.” Sothis crossed her arms, seemed amused at Byleth’s confused look. “That ‘Sword of the Creator’ of yours? It’s my spine.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Oh.” Byleth wasn’t sure how to take that. “...It’s good I didn’t throw it off the Goddess tower then.”</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, I would have been quite cross with you." </p><p> </p><p>"...Actually, how is it your spine? It's almost as tall as you." </p><p> </p><p>"Clearly this isn't my original form!" Sothis argued with a frown. "As I'm incomplete, I am stuck in this form."</p><p> </p><p>"Right," Byleth said, refraining from pointing out the possibility that the sword was from her dragon form, and that she might have been a small dragon. Actually, that raised another question. “Did you have your children on your own?”</p><p> </p><p>“...What exactly are you asking?” Sothis questioned, raising an eyebrow at Byleth.</p><p> </p><p>“I want to know if there was a papa dragon involved. I’m asking because Rhea never actually said who my mama’s father was and I want to know if female dragons can just have kids on their own.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Sothis pinched the bridge of her nose. “I am capable of creating life on my own, yes, though I doubt Rhea is capable of doing the same, given that she clearly is not at the same level of power as I once was. I don’t know if a Nabatean could reach that level of power given how little I remember of my previous life, but, at best, she could probably make some sort of artificial life through alchemy.” She sighed. “That is likely the true origin of your mother. A homunculus, made with my heart in an attempt to resurrect me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. Hm. That does make sense. Thank you for explaining.”</p><p> </p><p>“...why do you sound relieved?”</p><p> </p><p>“I was starting to get worried I could get spontaneously pregnant, and I’m not ready for kids,” Byleth admitted, before tilting her head in thought, “I’m not sure if I want kids. I like teaching my students, so maybe? But I think there would be a lot more involved and I’m kind of worried I wouldn’t be good at any of it.” She paused. “Why are you covering your face?”</p><p> </p><p>Sothis let out a deep sigh into the hands she had pressed to her face, her exasperation obvious. “I explain to you the likely origin of your mother and your first concern is if you are capable of immaculate conception.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think it’s a valid worry. Rhea’s title is ‘Immaculate One’, isn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> That’s not why she’s named– </em>Ugh, okay, I’m not going to get angry, it’s not your fault you don’t have any context for any of this. It is your fault that you’re this stupid though,” she grumbled, “...or maybe it’s Jeralt’s.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Papa was a good teacher.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, he wasn’t. He was a decent parent, but I cannot say a man that hid basic realities of the world in which you live is a good teacher.”</p><p> </p><p>“...He tried his best.”</p><p> </p><p>"Given the situation he was dealt, yes, but that does not mean he didn't make mistakes." Sothis huffed. "But we can talk about that later. For now, you should probably awaken and see how exactly smuggling you out will go." </p><p> </p><p>"Right, and…regardless of who you are, I'm glad I met you, Sothis," Byleth said, smiling at her friend before closing her eyes to awaken. </p><p> </p><p>Only to end up jolting awake when a boulder came crashing through her door.</p><p> </p><p>"...Sothis, how long have I been asleep?" </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know, half an hour???" the diminutive goddess exclaimed, staring in shock at the massive rock smashed into the doorway to Byleth’s room.</p><p> </p><p>As for the professor herself, she had just one question: "What the fuck happened while I was sleeping?" </p>

  <p>Jeralt had the worst headache of his life. And considering how often he woke up hungover, that was saying something.</p><p> </p><p>Granted, alcohol could be blamed in part for the pain in his head, though most of it came from the simple fact that he was right all along and he never should have trusted Rhea. Which…yeah, it hurt to admit that. In his chest, not just his head.</p><p> </p><p>He’d had a bad feeling when he saw just how nervous Byleth looked that night she talked with Rhea, so to find out she wanted to show Byleth something about 'her people' certainly left a bad taste in his mouth. He didn't know what exactly she was planning, but whatever it was likely had to do with what she had in mind back when Byleth was born. He didn’t know what she was up to exactly, but whatever it was, if she threatened his kids, he'd deal with the immortal archbishop himself. </p><p> </p><p>"...Should probably tell the kids how old the two of us actually are." He sighed, then splashed his face with some water before he left the washroom. He needed to have at least some of his mind working if he was going to get his kids and his company out of the monastery without Rhea causing problems.</p><p> </p><p>He’d given his lieutenants the heads up the night before, letting them know they might be making a quick exit if things went wrong. His excuse to Rhea was going to be that he’d heard Alois had been sighted and he was going to take his troops to find his old apprentice. In the meantime, Byleth would be getting out of there with that princess she liked and Shez would join them a little later. Easy enough, hopefully.</p><p> </p><p>A part of him felt bad for using Alois as an excuse when he still didn’t know if the man was even alive. It wasn’t going to stop him, but he did feel bad about it.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright, just gotta work on guard duty till we can get everything ready," Jeralt muttered to himself, before pausing as he heard some screams. Frowning, he looked over to see people running in his direction. Though as he began to move in their direction, he stumbled for a moment as a large boulder slammed into the roof of the building next to him. "What the hell!?" </p><p> </p><p>"Captain!" a knight shouted as he ran up to him, "The kingdom is invading and is using siege equipment, we need to move!"</p><p> </p><p>"What?" Jeralt heard another crash as another boulder hit a different part of the monastery. "What the hell–Ah, assemble the knights, we need to focus on getting everyone to safety first!" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes sir!" The knight responded, saluting him before running off. </p><p> </p><p>Frowning, Jeralt began to run for the gates, trying to get a good idea of what was going on. Whatever it was, getting out of here just got that much more difficult. Arriving at the gates, he saw a throng of people rushing into the monastery while several knights tried to keep things orderly. </p><p> </p><p>"Someone tell me what's going on!" </p><p> </p><p>"Captain Jeralt," Gilbert spoke up, getting the acting captain's attention, "The regent Rufus is currently invading the monastery with forces from the kingdom. Lady Rhea has also stated that the Kingdom will lose all legitimacy because of this invasion." </p><p> </p><p>"...What?" That was far more than Jeralt expected. </p><p> </p><p>"Captain!" Came the voices of his mercenaries, running up to him from the town. “What the hell is–”</p><p> </p><p>“What’s going on is obvious,” Gertrude interrupted, speaking over Victor, “What’s important is what we need to do. Captain, your orders?”</p><p> </p><p>Shaking his head, Jeralf focused; every second counted right now. "Alright, we can talk about the reasons why we’re being attacked later," Jeralt decided, before looking at the knights and mercenaries. "Gertrude, you and Victor set up a base for the injured to be taken care of! Ezra, I want you to find out what you can about the Kingdom’s forces! Candace, you and Gilbert focus on defending the gates and make sure no one gets past!" </p><p> </p><p>He was glad to see them immediately move to complete his orders. </p><p> </p><p>"And what are you going to do?" Aside from Gilbert. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm going to talk with Rhea," Jeralt said, frowning at the thought of having to talk with her again, "Also, I have to say, I'm surprised you seem okay with what's going to happen to the Kingdom." </p><p> </p><p>"...I would not say I'm fine with Lady Rhea’s decision. Once this is over, I shall be asking her for leniency, but now is not the time." </p><p> </p><p>“Smart man. Take it from me, Rhea has a temper. She might calm down once we handle things here. For now, just follow my orders and I’ll make sure we get through this,” he stated, thoughts already racing as he tried to figure out just how this was going to work.</p><p><br /><em> Siege equipment means catapults, ballistas, probably fire orbs too. If they’re planning to stick things out, they’ll want a perimeter established and the Kingdom has enough pegasus knights to set up an air blockade, </em> he thought as he raced through the monastery, looking for Rhea, <em> We can probably hold out for a while, but if we don’t have supplies coming in and no one comes by to support us…this is going to be messy. </em></p><hr /><p>Edelgard was thankful that she had the foresight to bring her armor with her. She hadn't expected to get into a fight, but it always paid to be prepared. As such it wasn't long before she was fully armored and moving to her classmates. </p><p> </p><p>"Edelgard, what's going on?" Ferdinand called out to her as she arrived at the courtyard. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, what's this about the kingdom being bad guys??" Caspar asked as well, the young man looking confused but holding his axe ready to fight. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know the full context, but it seems the regent Rufus is trying to establish himself as the king. The important thing right now is being prepared for whatever they throw at us," Edelgard stated while checking to make sure everyone was there, “The Kingdom has demanded we Eagles be turned over as political prisoners, so I’ll need all of you to stay vigilant."</p><p> </p><p>"B-But why would they want us? W-We're just students!" Bernadetta shouted, hiding behind Hubert. </p><p> </p><p>"Mari and I aren't even from the Empire, so are they also going to want us?" Hapi asked, glancing at the former Deer. </p><p> </p><p>"I-I'm not just going to leave." </p><p> </p><p>"I doubt it'll matter to them anyways since they're invading the monastery," Monica pointed out. “They may just choose to capture whatever noble students they can get. And if they’re working for the same people that attacked your professor–”</p><p> </p><p>“Those Who Slither in the Dark,” Hubert stated, earning an annoyed huff from Monica.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I know, you came up with an amazing name for them, no one cares. The important thing is keeping everyone safe and finding a route out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Woah, wait, aren’t we going to help fight these guys?” Caspar asked.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll likely have to, though we should prioritize getting everyone to safety,” Edelgard stated, “Where is Professor Byleth? She’s a skilled strategist and combatant, we’ll want her here with us.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I saw her earlier,” Flayn spoke up, “Shez was taking her to her room!”</p><p> </p><p>“So the professor gets to nap while a disaster happens?” Linhardt asked, sounding faintly miffed.</p><p> </p><p>"We should be waking her!" Petra suggested. </p><p> </p><p>"You all should go get her,” Constance added, “My unworthy existence shall go to the battlefield to buy you all time." </p><p> </p><p>"No battle plans until we find the professor!" Dorothea said, before heading off to the dorms, with the Black Eagles in tow. </p><p> </p><p>Walking a bit behind the group, Edelgard began to plan on the best ways to fight back against the invading force, where her classmates would be safest and what route they should use to escape–</p><p> </p><p>"PROFESSOR!" Only for her mind to come to a halt at Dorothea's sudden yell. Rushing forward, Edelgard felt her heart sink as she saw a large boulder had smashed into Byleth’s dorm room. </p><p> </p><p>As the Black Eagles began to call out to the professor on the other side, they could hear someone's muffled yelling coming from inside. </p><p> </p><p>"Move," Edelgard demanded, her tone brokering no argument as the students who tried to move the boulder made way. Gritting her teeth, Edelgard grabbed onto the rock, her fingers practically digging into the hard stone as she called upon her crests. With a grunt of exertion, she lifted the rock above herself, freeing the former mercenary. </p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit.” She wasn’t sure who spoke, but they sounded impressed. Either way, Edelgard set the boulder down at her side, then immediately smiled when she saw her professor.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, my teacher.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hello, Edelgard,” Byleth greeted with a fond smile, before pausing, “And hello everyone else. If we have time, could someone explain what’s happening and if we’re under attack?”</p><p> </p><p>Immediately all her students started talking, their voices drowning one another out. After a few moments, Byleth nodded. </p><p> </p><p>"Alright, we need to focus on defense then. We should move to the Cathedral, it's the most fortified building of the monastery, and it'll limit enemy forces thanks to the bridge. Constance, I need you to provide support in the air in case any pegasus squads come at us. Bernadetta, you keep her safe with cover in case anyone approaches her in the air," Byleth said, having understood everything, "Edelgard, we're going to need to meet up with the other teachers and house leaders to plan our defenses. Ferdinand, you can lead the Eagles in the meantime. I trust your judgement, just make sure everyone gets to a safe place as soon as possible.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, of course professor!” Ferdinand agreed, nodding sharply at Byleth’s orders before quickly turning to the others. “Alright everyone, let’s be quick and careful!”</p><p> </p><p>“Monica, Hubert, go with everyone else,” Edelgard instructed, holding up a hand to forestall any protests, “Professor Byleth can keep me safe well enough and every one of my classmates is a valuable target for our enemies. I will be with you as soon as possible.”</p><p> </p><p>“Very well, Lady Edelgard,” Hubert said with a bow while Monica grimaced.</p><p> </p><p>“Please be safe.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will.” With that, Edelgard and Byleth promptly hurried towards the central building of the academy. “I have to say, it’s always nice to see you work,” she complimented on the way.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you. It’s nice having you back.” Byleth said, before glancing at Edelgard. "I kissed Dorothea." </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard stumbled a bit. "Excuse me?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, technically she kissed me, but I just wanted to let you know that we're dating, and that I really like you as well, and I hope we can make this work." </p><p> </p><p>“...Professor, I feel like there were more appropriate times you could have told me this.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was going to mention it earlier, but I didn’t get a chance,” Byleth said, feeling her face heat up a bit. "And I want to be able to say it as soon as I could. I still don't understand everything with my emotions, but I don't want to ignore them." </p><p> </p><p>“Hm. That’s a good thing to do, but I also feel like this may be…no, never mind. Thank you for informing me, professor. And…I hope to pursue things further after we handle things here.”</p><p> </p><p>Despite the circumstances, Byleth found a smile making its way onto her face. She really did enjoy having her student back.</p><hr /><p>Dimitri had probably the deepest frown on his face that Shez had ever seen. It was kinda interesting, but also unfortunate given the circumstances. Though she could understand how he was feeling. She’d been around when he got the news, and the way his eyes went wide looked almost more horrified than surprised.</p><p> </p><p>And now, he had to argue for his nation. “Lady Rhea, I beg you to reconsider! Punishing the whole of Faerghus for the actions of–” </p><p> </p><p>“Dimitri, your uncle has chosen to side with the worst heretics the land of Fodlan has ever faced,” Rhea stated plainly and simply, though it was obvious to everyone there that she was barely restraining some obvious rage, “He is a traitor to everything that the faith stands for and I will <em> not </em> hold back in ensuring everyone who chooses to side with him will be punished to the fullest extent.”</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, I understand, but we need to find out who was forced to work with him!" </p><p> </p><p>"We can do that after we win, buddy," Claude noted, his usual smile being thinner than usual. This whole mess caught him just as off guard as everyone else, and that seemed to genuinely bother him.</p><p> </p><p>"On that note, we should figure out what the prince needs to do," Jeralt said, his frown heavy, "If the kingdom is invading, then maybe he could get some of them to put down their weapons?" </p><p> </p><p>"My apologies Sir Jeralt, but I feel as if that would be far too dangerous for a student," Hanneman stated, glancing at the captain. "They have already made it clear they want to take the Adrestian students hostage, and I doubt they'll stop at just them." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, if anything they'll take this as a chance to 'rescue' the kingdom kids," Manuela muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“I can’t just hang back and do nothing!” Dimitri argued, “These are my countrymen! I understand they are acting against the church, but they’re clearly being misled!”</p><p> </p><p>"Regardless of who is leading them, they are attacking Garreg Mach. So we need to act now," Rhea stated, almost growling. Her glare only lessened slightly as the doors opened and Byleth and Edelgard rushed in. </p><p> </p><p>Dimitri though, his eyes narrowed, a frown coming to his face at the sight of Edelgard.</p><p> </p><p>"Where are all the students?" Byleth asked upon entering and looking around to see who was there. Upon spotting Shez, she smiled and waved to her sister, who returned the wave with an awkward grin.</p><p> </p><p>"Hanneman has his Lions by the knights barracks helping out there, and my Deer are by the entrance hall, helping guide noncombatants somewhere safe," Manuela answered.</p><p> </p><p>“Good, I have the Eagles fortifying the chapel. We can evacuate noncombatants there, it’s a defensible position.” She paused, a thought occurring. “Would Abyss be a good evacuation point? Not many people know about it and there’s a lot of room down there.” </p><p> </p><p>"Abyss is supposed to be a secret of the monastery, not somewhere the townspeople should be going into," Rhea stated. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't really think something like that matters right now," Jeralt pointed out, annoyance filling his tone. </p><p> </p><p>"...Very well. We'll try to get as many people as we can to the cathedral, but for those we can't, they'll be guided to Abyss." </p><p> </p><p>"We should also make sure to take supplies to both locations, we don't know how long we will be fighting off the Kingdom’s forces," Edelgard suggested, getting Rhea to frown before nodding. </p><p> </p><p>"Very well. In that case, the Eagles can remain stationed at the Cathedral, and the Deer can help move people into Abyss. Dimitri, I will tell you now, even if you get your countrymen to lay down their arms, they will not evade punishment for their transgressions," Rhea stated, staring at the prince, who nodded. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course. Once they are aware they're being led astray, I'm sure they'll accept whatever punishment you give them," Dimitri said, doing his best to seem strong. </p><p> </p><p>“So maybe make that punishment something other than death,” Jeralt spoke up, frowning at Rhea, who returned the look, “Take from me, if people know they’re dead either way, you’re going to get a lot that refuse to surrender. If it’s between dying to the noose or dying to the sword, most men will take their chances with killing the guy who’s holding the sword.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Fine. Leniency will be shown to those who lay down their arms." </p><p> </p><p>"So, what are our orders once we finish guiding people down?" Claude asked as he raised a hand. </p><p> </p><p>"You are to aid the Blue Lions. The same order applies to the Eagles once the Cathedral is secured." </p><p> </p><p>"Alright, let's get to it then!" Shez shouted, pumping her fists. While not as energetic, the rest of those in attendance got ready to move out. </p><p> </p><p>"Actually, Professor Byleth, I need a word with you." Up until Rhea spoke up, making Byleth stiffen. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…what about?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, Rhea, what do you need?" Jeralt asked, his frown deepening. </p><p> </p><p>Rhea stayed silent, considering her words. This was the best chance she had, and really, the best option for the monastery. If the goddess were to descend now, then the heretics would be smited without question. She just had to get her down there. "...Actually, I believe you and Shez should stay as well. You too, Emperor Edelgard." </p><p> </p><p>That got some looks of concern and confusion from the group there, but before long, those asked to stay were the only ones left. They were still in a siege, so everyone needed to get to work, which was why Byleth nodded to her father, confirming she would be fine.</p><p> </p><p>Once he left, she looked at the archbishop. "What did you need, Lady Rhea?" </p><p> </p><p>"Recently, you told me of a dream you were having. I believe this to be a sign," Rhea said, choosing her words carefully as she spoke evenly, "Much like with Seiros before, I believe that you will receive a message from the goddess. To do so, I want to take you to a secret location within the monastery, with those closest to you by your side. Truth be told, it would be proper for your entire class to be there as well, much like how Seiros had her fellow Saints by her side, but given the situation, I think it would be best if they were to remain up here." </p><p> </p><p>“Mm. Okay. I haven’t heard that story before.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea paused. “Well, it may not be a common one, but it is a part of Fodlan’s history. I think it would be a method through which you could commune with the goddess directly.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, alright. Is that what you think will happen?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course it is.” Rhea felt a small frown come to her face. “Is there an issue, child? I have given you my answer.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. I want to ask if you’re telling me the truth. Is that genuinely what you believe will happen?”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea frowned. Shez and Edelgard were frowning too, the former crossing her arms over her chest while the latter seemed confused by the questioning, yet just as suspicious of the archbishop. “...Yes. I genuinely do believe you will receive a divine revelation from the goddess should you take a seat upon that throne.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. You’re lying to me.” Byleth sighed. “Okay. I thought that would be the case, but…well, I lied too, so I guess that makes it even.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not okay, By,” Shez murmured, frowning at her sister, who shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“No, you’re right, it’s not okay. I think it’s even though. Things being balanced doesn’t mean they’re okay, it just means…I lied about the girl on the throne being asleep, she’s been awake this whole time,” Byleth bluntly stated, staring into Rhea’s widened eyes. "She knows what you're trying to do, and wants no part in it." </p><p> </p><p>"...W-What?" Rhea asked, as she felt her heart stop. “No, that–That isn’t possible–”</p><p> </p><p>“It is. You made it possible. You put her heart in my chest, didn’t you? You created my mother as a vessel for the goddess and you wanted to make me one too. That’s why I can see her, that’s why I can use the Sword of the Creator, and that’s why I’ve had dreams of your war against Nemesis for years now, Seiros. A lot of things make sense now. And I…I don’t know what else you want from me, but I don’t want to be a part of it." </p><p> </p><p>"That–No, you can't just–" </p><p> </p><p>“I will defend the monastery from those attempting to besiege it, and I swear to you, I will keep the people here safe. Afterwards, I’ll probably leave. Please don’t try to impede me, it could put people in danger.”</p><p> </p><p>"I might not have sufficient context about what is occurring, but the Professor has the protection of the Empire,” Edelgard spoke up, moving to stand beside Byleth, “We will not declare war on the monastery, but I will not allow any harm to occur to her." </p><p> </p><p>“Also I can warp really easily,” Shez pointed out, “So if you try to push things, By and I can be gone in–”</p><p> </p><p>“No, wait,” Byleth interrupted, looking at her sister, “Don’t do that, please. We still have people we need to protect here. I don’t want to see anyone be hurt.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well yeah, that’s–By, I was going to come back, I’d just get you out first.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay. Sorry, I misunderstood.” Apology given, she turned back to Rhea, meeting the archbishop's eyes. “I’m going to go help everyone now. I hope you’ll be willing to work with us, even if I don’t do what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“No. No, you cannot,” Rhea insisted, finally getting her bearings, “You do not understand, the world needs you to be the goddess! I don’t know what I did wrong, but I swear to you, this is your purpose! You are meant to be our world’s savior!”</p><p> </p><p>"I would suggest leaving now," Sothis said, and Byleth found herself agreeing.</p><p> </p><p>"I am not the goddess. My name is Byleth Eisner. That's all I am," Byleth stated, turning around to leave. </p><p> </p><p>"We're not done here!" Rhea shouted, reaching out to grab her. Yet Shez moved a second sooner than she could, her hand grasping air as the mercenary warped away with her sister and the Emperor. </p><p> </p><p>Rhea remained silent as she stared at the empty space before her, the monastery shaking around her. Clenching her fists, the archbishop let out a scream of pure rage. </p><hr /><p>“So we’re gonna have to run the instant this invasion is over, huh?” Shez commented, glancing at her sister.</p><p> </p><p>“Probably. Why did you bring us to the roof?” Byleth asked, returning the look with one of faint confusion.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s the first place I thought of. Oh yeah, Edelgard, are you alright? No bits missing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I am–...Is that a genuine concern?” Edelgard asked, furrowing her brow.</p><p> </p><p>“Ehh…I don’t think so, but also I don’t usually travel with two people, so I’m kinda concerned, you know? Though don’t worry, Byleth knows how to heal, she can fix–” </p><p> </p><p>And Byleth promptly shoved both Shez and Edelgard down to avoid a spear thrown at them by a pegasus knight up in the air, before retaliating with a fire spell that blasted the woman off her mount. “We should probably be somewhere with more cover.”</p><p> </p><p>"Right." Grabbing the two, Shez teleported again, taking them inside the greenhouse. </p><p> </p><p>"...Well it's some cover," Byleth muttered, "Okay, Edelgard, you need to get to the Cathedral, and get the Black Eagles ready to leave in case Rhea tries anything. We know she's after me, but she might try to capture any of you to get me to go with her." </p><p> </p><p>"Professor, if I tell them to get ready to run for your sake, they'll just immediately come charging to try and help you." Edelgard argued. </p><p> </p><p>“Then…Then tell them to be ready for when I get there. Or…mh, this is a bad time for Rhea to turn against us. If we can’t trust the church knights to be on our side…” She grimaced, some genuine frustration welling up in her. “…Just tell them to evacuate the townspeople, as planned, and to run the instant the enemy shows up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Professor, that doesn’t solve–“</p><p> </p><p>“I know it doesn’t. I can’t put you all in danger, you need to be safe–“</p><p> </p><p>“Or you could ask them to actually help you,” Shez pointed out with a frown.</p><p> </p><p>“This isn’t a situation they can help in. If Rhea is an enemy now, then we cannot trust our allies–“</p><p> </p><p>“Then what’s the actual plan here? Because it sounds like I should just take you away from the monastery so you’ll be safe and then we can figure things out.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t do that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why not? Genuinely, why not? I can get you out of here, then come back for dad, our friends, the mercenaries, everybody! Let the Kingdom guys take the monastery, it doesn’t matter as long as we get out of here!”</p><p> </p><p>"People are in danger, Shez." </p><p> </p><p>"And I don't care about them. I care about you and my friends." </p><p> </p><p>"Then get them out of here if they want to get out of here. I'm going to fight until we either win or lose." </p><p> </p><p>"Byleth, will you just listen to me!?" </p><p> </p><p>"Shez, I think the professor–"</p><p> </p><p>"You stay out of this!" Shez shouted, shoving Edelgard back. </p><p> </p><p>"Shez, you need to calm down," Byleth said with a frown, moving in between the two. </p><p> </p><p>"Why do you keep choosing her side!? You're my sister!" Shez shouted, glaring at her. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not choosing sides. I'm just trying to do what I can." </p><p> </p><p>"And we should be trying to get out of here!" Shez countered, before suddenly trying to grab Byleth’s arm. The thought in her head was that if she just got Byleth out of there, everything would be fine. But instead Byleth smacked her hand away, hard enough for it to hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“Shez, you need to stop. This is my fight–” She paused, her eyes widening when she saw the genuine frustration on Shez’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“...Fine. Fine, whatever. Don’t expect me to help–Fh…” She grimaced, shaking her head. “That’s not…just…”</p><p> </p><p>“...Shez, wait–” Byleth began to say before Shez flashed away on her own, off to another corner of the monastery.</p><p> </p><p>Rubbing her eyes as tears began to prick them, she moved to find the Golden Deer. She wouldn’t abandon her friends, she wouldn’t just…she just couldn’t be around Byleth right now, not with her head aching like this.</p><p> </p><p>"Fuck this school," Shez grumbled to herself, "Nothing has gone right because of this place." </p><p> </p><p>"It truly is a sham of a holy place, isn't it, partner?" Arval asked, floating behind her. Their voice was quiet and soothing, like a cool balm to the heat she felt building up in her skull. "But don't worry, I'll always be at your side." </p><p> </p><p>“...Thanks Arval. I’m glad I’ve got at least one person on my side,” she muttered bitterly, earning a small, pleased smile from her ever-present partner. </p><p> </p><p>It was almost time.</p><hr /><p>“What a beautiful day,” Myson remarked ironically, staring up at the foggy sky overhead where pegasi and wyverns clashed, a barely visible skirmish consisting of unseen ambushes and sudden strikes, all set off by one of the Kingdom’s pegasus knights getting knocked from the sky. One battle in the midst of a siege, ultimately inconsequential in the long run.</p><p> </p><p>Well, unless one of those bodies managed to crush someone important. That might change things.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, quite…are you certain I should be here right now, Lord Myson?” Odesse asked, still in his Acheron guise as he stood beside his master, “I would think you would want me still managing Ordelia territory.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a sage now, Odesse. That means you leave administrative issues to a lesser.”</p><p> </p><p>“That is true, but also I’m the only one with the Acheron disguise.”</p><p> </p><p>“True, but it’s not like we really need ‘legitimacy’ to maintain our holdings there. What are the beasts going to do anyway? Die in droves again?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha, probably. Perhaps they’re hoping enough of their corpses will land in the right place to make a hill over the walls?”</p><p> </p><p>“If you two are done chuckling to yourselves, we have a war to win,” Chilon grumbled as he moved up to stand beside his fellow sages, his silver armor matching the cool fog being maintained through magic by Kyrie. All the better to hide the forces they’d snuck in under the archbishop’s nose.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a siege, Chilon. You’re meant to be a warrior, you should understand the concept of patience,” Myson chided, before giving the armored Agarthan a glance, “Though I can understand if you’re eager to try out your new equipment.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. Mock me all you wish. I will be the one to tear out that abomination’s heart on this day.” He flexed his hand, glancing down at the additions affixed to his gauntlet. Atop the steel of the armor covering his hand, lined with Kingdom blue, was what could initially be seen as a Hero’s relic. Its material resembled the bone of a standard relic, and it had a stone affixed to its center, though the “bone” was an ashen-black and the core lacked a crest. “How many of these ‘amplifiers’ have you made?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m surprised you’re even curious. And what you have isn’t so much an amplifier as it is a shield.” Myson smirked. “It would be a true shame to let all the work we put into Lady Edelgard’s relic go to waste, after all. Especially when I finally have the opportunity to acquire a proper crest stone to use in it, instead of having to reuse one from those wretched storm dragons.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Do you think we should try to acquire Blutgang after this?” Odesse inquired, looking thoughtful, “We may have managed to recreate it, but having the original is better than just having copies, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps…confiscating the remaining relics from the ‘noble’ beasts holding onto them could be a good choice,” Myson mused, “They’ve long outlasted whatever usefulness their ancestors had. Though perhaps what remaining blood of the abominations they have within them could be put to use? Of course, if they do simply bow down to us, then we can take things at a slower–”</p><p> </p><p>“You think those wretches will bow to us?” Chilon questioned, his voice filled with derision, “These beasts are far too attached to their meaningless loyalties to ever bow their heads in truth. I have already had complaints from the beasts in this army of our choice in assaulting the monastery, concerns that the boulders we let loose could potentially kill that ‘prince’ of theirs.”</p><p> </p><p>“The one we’re slandering as being involved in his own father’s murder?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not everyone believes that. They think we are here for retribution against the Empire and the archbishop, and that ‘his highness’ is in need of rescue.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? That’s hilarious. I almost want to kill the prince just to see their reactions now…”</p><p> </p><p>“We could always ensure his death as a way of boosting the beasts drive for vengeance,” Odesse suggested, “Perhaps if we entertain the idea of a peace talk between us and then murder him there?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, an interesting proposition…” Myson rubbed his chin, thinking. “We would need to frame it as treachery on part of the Church if we wish to have it land properly though–“</p><p> </p><p>“Why bother?” Chilon interrupted, irritated, “Let’s smash down the gates and put an end to this farce.”</p><p> </p><p>“Weren’t you supposed to be a guard? You really have no sense for–“</p><p> </p><p>“I have enough sense to know we shouldn’t be waiting for the abominations to attack!” He paused, seeming to think. “And I am the one commanding this army. So we will be attacking, right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“…If you insist, commander. Do as you wish. Break down the gates, unleash your soldiers, and bring down the abominations. You have my blessing.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need it,” Chilon growled as he moved away from them, heading towards the amassed knights, mounts, and siege weapons that formed their army.</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t it reckless to attack now?” Odesse pointed out, “I thought Bias was still getting ready.”</p><p> </p><p>"And who will we lose? Some kingdom beasts and maybe Chilon, nothing we cannot do without," Myson said, grabbing a bottle of wine to pour into two cups. "If it’s really any true trouble, we can just send Anaximandros after him to back the idiot up. For now, care to toast for impending victory?" </p><p> </p><p>"Of course, Lord Myson," Odesse replied, taking the cup and clinking it against Myson’s. With a grin, the two drank as they relaxed. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, I must admit, the beasts do have some uses," Myson muttered, swirling his wine around, "Perhaps I'll keep some of them around." </p><p> </p><p>It would be his country soon enough, after all.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Shez was not in the greatest of moods, and as such, once the opportunity to work out her stress came before her in the form of those Kingdom assholes breaking through the gates and invading the town, she happily indulged in it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tossing her sword so it could shred through a group of mages, Shez flicked her hand to the side, forming Dark Spikes in time to pierce a paladin rushing her, though a moment later she felt a sudden flash of pain as a thoron from a surviving mage crashed into her. Gritting her teeth, she resummoned her sword and cut down the mage, before flashing over to a group of pikemen and separating their heads from their shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can’t do this alone,” Arval noted, his voice in her ear as she scowled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up! I’ve got this!” Shez snapped back, ignoring the pain as she rushed forward once again, aiming for the most enemies she could see. "Come on assholes, the Violet Demon is ready to take on all of you!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rather than answer with some banter, the Kingdom Knights only yelled in response as they charged at her. Ducking under a spear aimed at her head, Shez stabbed through the armored knight's chest before using him as a human shield as she charged the rest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know you do. All I’m saying is that you need to use the abilities you have at your disposal,” Arval replied, “Do you really want to put yourself at risk holding back the power you have?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez grunted, shoving the knight off her blades and scanning the increasingly hectic battlefield. Looking around at the forces surrounding her, her eyes honed in on a knight with slightly fancier armor on a horse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flashing away, she reappeared on the horse behind the knight and stabbed her sword into his neck. Grabbing onto the reins as the horse started to go wild, Shez pulled hard to make the horse trample over kingdom forces. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I got this, I know I–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t doubt you. Just stop letting yourself be hurt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused for just a moment, long enough for an arrow to thud into her arm and make her grimace in genuine pain, before she ripped it free and let her awakened form loose. Her hair lightened, taking on a fiery shade while an orange halo formed around her head. In an instant, all the pain in her body vanished and she felt a genuine smile come to her marked face at the rush of pure power going through her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With a roar, she charged at the group of archers, who had just a moment to panic before they were cut down by the mercenary. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez felt more alive than she ever had before as she cut down swathes of knights. Even as weapons pierced her and spells battered her body she kept moving, letting her rage carry her. So when a knight she was about to stab was blasted with a Luna she didn't cast, she immediately pulled her horse back, glaring at whoever took her kill. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez, what are you doing!?" yelled a diminutive mage, staring up at the bloodsoaked mercenary. Shez stared back in confusion, her mind in a haze as several other students moved in to help. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey Shez, since when did you take horse riding lessons?" an archer atop a wyvern asked, a smirk on his face as he shot down some pegasus knights trying to swoop down. Which was a stupid question because she’d known how to ride horses for years, ever since Ezra taught–Or, wait, was it her dad that taught her? Or…both? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shook her head, trying to keep her thoughts from distracting her. Candace liked horses anyway, she was probably the one–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Keep your wits about you!” shouted a guy on a horse. Purple-haired, like her, and there was another person on a horse–a girl, orange hair, using a bow like the other archer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, you okay?” Orange girl asked, looking worried for some reason.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” was Shez’s immediate retort, shaking off the weird confusion and nodding to–Leonie, right, she knew Leonie, they were friends, they met in that village.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pulled the reins of her horse, focusing back on the battle. An archer with glasses was shooting down enemies and two big muscular guys were smashing any knight that was dumb enough to get close. They were her friends, she knew that, and none of the people in black and gold uniforms were enemies, she remembered that much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a flash of pink hair out of the corner of her eye and Shez felt herself grin when she saw the girl with an axe bury it into the head of one of the bulky knights. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Right, I need to get back to it. No more screwing around.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that thought, Shez warped away from her steed and cut through another knight, sending the woman’s head flying before she leaped, swinging her swords in a whirlwind of death, carving another swathe through the Kingdom’s army. She wasn’t going to stop, she couldn’t stop, she was going to kill every last one of these bastards that were trying to hurt her family.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the field of battle, Shez looked like a genuine demon. Blood soaked her swords, her clothes, her hair and skin. The markings on her face, the shining, spiked rings floating around her head and wrists, they all made her look like something otherworldly. And it felt like even more power was burning in her body, just waiting to be unleashed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You could destroy this entire army. None of them can stand up to you. You’ll be a true hero.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez saw some of the soldiers scatter, routed, fleeing the brutal killer in their midst. Which…was a good thing. Getting the enemy to retreat was good–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should finish them. Letting the rats scurry away means they can come back to bite–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Miss Eisner!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused, her attention drawn to a man on a wyvern, his hair a familiar shade of green. He was accompanied by a vaguely familiar boy on his own wyvern, the newer addition to their class–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good goddess, are you alright?” The man sounded worried, for some reason.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. The blood isn’t mine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s…I suppose that’s a better answer–Where is your sister?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She paused, her grip tightening on her swords. “Why do you want her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Rhea wants her,” the boy spoke before the man could, his voice terse, “So you’d better tell us where she is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cyril, you don’t need to–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Go fuck yourselves,” Shez growled, agitation burning in her chest, “You try to take her and I’ll kill all of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Miss–no, Shez, I swear to you, I do not mean Professor Eisner any harm,” the man said, concern audible in his voice, “I just want–...what in the world is…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He trailed off, staring upwards with a look of growing horror. Shez turned her gaze in the same direction and felt her eyes widen in shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh that’s just not fair,” Shez muttered as she stared up, unable to do anything but watch as a mass of meteors fell from the sky, turning the fog overhead a bright red like the sky itself was on fire. Dimly, she half-remembered a lesson about the meteor spell and its effects. Effects that didn’t involve more than one enormous, flaming rock falling from the sky at once, yet reality was not conforming to what she knew and there were easily over two dozen up there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved without thinking, turning and sprinting back to the monastery at a speed most humans couldn’t match. She needed to get back and protect–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez!" Lysithea screamed, catching her attention through the haze of heat filling her mind. With a burst of speed, Shez jumped, tackling Lysithea into a building just as the meteors hit. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Dimitri was not having a good day. Few people were really, yet Dimitri couldn't help but grimace as he stabbed another one of his countrymen who wouldn't surrender. He had to take down his countrymen before, when rebellion's needed to be stopped, but he had been able to prepare for those. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It didn’t help that he was just…so confused right now. He knew he needed to speak to Edelgard to find out what she knew about Rufus’s claims. If his uncle was telling the truth, then Lord Arundel and Lady Patricia…they were brother and sister, if one had been involved than the other–He had to focus. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He could ask Edelgard how much she knew later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please, listen to me!” he called out, trying to get the soldiers to stop, “I don't know what Rufus has told you all, but he's lying!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lay down your weapons, your highness!” shouted one of the knights, his voice difficult to hear over the din of battle, “We only wish to clear up this misunder–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck that! You killed your own father, didn’t you, boy?!” shouted another knight, the vitriol in his voice catching Dimitri off guard, “You see how easily he kills his own countrymen!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri opened his mouth to defend himself, before the second knight charged at him, raising his sword to cut down the prince. Yet the blade never hit since Dedue blocked the strike, while Felix moved quickly, his sword stabbing into the opening of the knight's armor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Keep your focus, boar!" Felix shouted as the knight gurgled on his blood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you see that!? The Frauldarius heir has turned traitor as well!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, he was just defending his highness!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's all the fault of that dastard from Duscur!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri watched on in horror as the knights turned at one another, their arguments quickly escalating before one stabbed the other with a spear. “NO! STOP, STOP!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re not going to listen to reason!” Felix snapped, scowling at the increasing bloodshed, “We need to–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can stop them!” Dimitri insisted, staring at the carnage with wide, horrified eyes, “I am their prince, I have to–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue suddenly pushed him back and Dimitri nearly fell just from the surprise. A moment later, he saw why his friend had pushed him as a number of knights in white armor drove their horses into the melee, trampling Kingdom forces and piercing through them with their lances.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It didn’t matter whether they’d been arguing for or against Dimitri; the men died all the same, blue cloth and steel staining red under the church’s cavalry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Your highness, get back to the monastery!" Gilbert shouted, moving up to cover the students. "This is too dangerous for you!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Gonna have to agree with him, Dimitri, I think this is a lost cause," Sylvain added, frowning heavily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Y-Yeah, the knights have it handled!" Annette agreed, her face pale as she stared at the bloodbath before her. Moving between the students, Mercedes did her best to heal any wounds she saw. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We can cover you as you move!" Ashe called, an arrow drawn as he kept an eye on anyone trying to approach Ingrid in the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Reinforcements coming around the corner!" Ingrid shouted, before ducking a volley of arrows aimed her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tearing his eyes away from the corpses, Dimitri saw a group of knights approaching. Clad in black armor, their leader wore a horned helm. They looked nothing like the forces the students had just faced, and the leader had a cruel smirk on his face as he looked at Dimitri. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So this is the wayward prince," he remarked, his horse coming to a halt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Halt! If you have any honor as a knight of Faerghus, you will stand down now!" Gilbert shouted, moving in front of the students.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if I would be a knight like those beasts. Though I may be working with them, I am not bound by the ‘honor’ they cling to. I am Anaximandros, and I am above such petty concerns." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something ticked in Dimitri’s brain as he stared at the black-armored knight. Somewhere deep in his mind, he remembered a conversation he had with Edelgard. About the ones who were truly behind the Tragedy of Duscur, fanning the flames of war between their nations. And in a moment, he felt a sudden rush as he realized just how truly stupid he was being.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All of a sudden, laughter echoed through the battlefield, catching everyone there off guard as they looked around for the source, before realizing it was Dimitri laughing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Anaximandros seemed more amused than unnerved though. "To think, such a small amount of blood is all it took to break him."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Boar, what are you doing–"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're part of them aren't you?" Dimitri asked, his hand clenching onto his spear. "The same group as Solon. The same group that caused the Tragedy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The students stared, their eyes wide and confused by what Dimitri was talking about. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...ahaha!" The horned knight laughed. "Ah, it seems you aren't as idiotic as your Uncle said." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you know?!” he snapped, pointing his spear directly at Anaximandros, “How much do you know about what happened that night!? Were you one of the people behind it!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Behind it? That’s what you think?” The helm showed just enough of the pale man’s face to display the truly vile smirk he had. “I was there, boy. You didn’t think we’d leave everything up to a pack of wild beasts, did you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The knight suddenly felt his head jerk back, his helm getting blown off as Dimitri’s spear went shooting past him, barely being deflected. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"KILL THEM ALL!" Dimitri ordered, charging forward as he grabbed a spear from a fallen knight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Your highness!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Damn it Boar, this isn’t the time for–!” Felix tried to shout, only for Dedue to rush forward, bringing his shield up as the dark knights unleashed blasts of dark magic right at their group. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dedue grit his teeth, trying to keep steady as the magic impacted his shield and began to corrode the metal. He held firm, but Dimitri didn’t focus on that, instead rushing past his friend with his spear in hand and a vicious scowl on his face that morphed into a maddened grin as he rushed towards Anaximandros, the leader’s pale face and dark hair bared while his golden eyes narrowed in an angered glare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You vile beast!” he snarled, urging his steed forward and leveling his lance to pierce through the prince’s chest. Two blasts of magic made his lance move to the side just enough for Dimitri to slip past. With another scream of fury and leap to bring him level with the knight, Dimitri jammed his spear into the leader's chest, the armor almost breaking under the force of the prince's crest. Yet it held strong enough for Anaximandros, with a furious scowl, to slam his fist into Dimitri’s face, a crack sounding out as the prince fell backwards, his broken nose bleeding. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Got you!" Sylvain shouted, riding past to grab his prince.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"L-Let go!" Dimitri shouted, struggling while his friend took him away, “I need to kill him! I need to avenge–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Get him back to the monastery!" Gilbert shouted as the students began to retreat, the knights covering their escape. Struggling in Sylvain's grasp, Dimitri nearly freed himself, before stopping when he saw clouds begin to part. The sounds of battle drained away as he watched a swarm of meteors begin to descend towards the monastery. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Emperor Edelgard, lay down your weapons-" Crushing the knight with her axe, Edelgard kept her guard up as she immediately twisted around to smash an assassin in the face with her shield. With the two down, she braced herself against her shield, enduring a cutting gale before charging forward into the mage's ranks, nearly breaking a wall when she smashed the mage against it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hearing the screams of the mages next to her, she silently thanked Hubert and Monica for dealing with the threats while she took the moment to catch her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Kingdom’s forces were many, but most of them were regular knights. They, however, weren't the problem, and she knew it was only a matter of time till the Agarthans unleashed their own soldiers. Sighing, Edelgard returned to her two retainers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Lady Edelgard!" Running up to her, Monica handed her a concoction, the Emperor downing it in a moment to revitalize herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Your majesty, you may not like to hear this, but it might be time to consider our means of retreat,” Hubert brought up, “The knights can't hold off these forces forever, and I'm not certain how well we can last if we try to wait for Bergliez's forces." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We'll hold on as long as we can," Edelgard responded, "We can't allow the kingdom to take the monastery." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Even so, you need to consider your own safety." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In the short term, my safety is much more in question if the church’s forces are routed. In the long term, the monastery is a dangerous location for the kingdom’s forces to take. Its central position makes it an excellent staging ground for attacks all across Fodlan, and it will be difficult to retake if they manage to seize it and fortify themselves.” Edelgard turned back towards the encroaching army, taking note of how the church’s knights fared against the kingdom’s soldiers. At the moment, there seemed to be a clash of quality against quantity. “So, at the very least, we need to make this venture too costly for them to maintain a hold on the monastery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I can see the benefit of that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, you shouldn't doubt her majesty, Hubert!" Monica said, even if she also wanted to get Edelgard out of there. Sighing in response, Hubert looked out over the battlefield. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Edelgard!" Glancing over, Edelgard saw the rest of the Eagles running up to them, haggard but uninjured. She felt a smile come onto her face as she saw her friends, especially when she saw Byleth covering them from behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm glad to see you're all okay," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ferdie was able to do a surprisingly good job,'' Dorothea said, getting the young noble to preen for a moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, though I wouldn't say it is much of a surprise–Ah, never mind that. What is the plan now?" Ferdinand asked, glancing between the Emperor and Professor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We try to help out as much as we can, but we need to be ready to leave at any moment," Byleth said, a frown on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? So we're just running away!?" Caspar exclaimed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A good hunter does know when it is prudent to end the hunt," Petra pointed out, “There is no shame to be retreating from a battle that is unable to be won.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…yeah, I guess so. Still, we’re not gonna do anything to help take these guys down?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s more important to make sure all of you are safe,” Byleth stated, though she seemed worried, looking around the area with a faint frown, “...I’ll try to send Jeralt over here. He can help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-Wait, you're leaving??" Bernadetta asked, her nerves already shot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just to find Jeralt," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, well, I can see the benefit of having such a skilled captain at our side," Constance muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't suppose I'll be able to sneak in a nap while we wait…" Linhardt murmured, before jolting when Hapi outright smacked him upside the head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not the time, Lin. Play the sleepy boy when we actually have time for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mnh, fine, I’ll try to focus. But I really shouldn’t be on the frontlines anyway–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then hang back and heal the injured if you truly cannot handle the fighting,” Edelgard suggested, frowning, “Where is Flayn?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Back at the cathedral,” Byleth answered, “She’s with the knights there, helping with the evacuations. Apparently there are secret tunnels, which will be our route out of here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see. Then allow me to go with you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. I know–I </span>
  <em>
    <span>know</span>
  </em>
  <span> Shez said I shouldn’t do everything by myself, but your priority should be making sure you and everyone else can get out of here. I can handle–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re missing an eye, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know I am, but I can’t–” Byleth abruptly stilled, a look of genuine horror crossing her face as she whirled around, staring at the sky. “ALL OF YOU, BACK TO THE CATHEDRAL, NOW!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Profess–” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard didn’t hesitate. She grabbed Ferdinand and pulled him with her, satisfied to see Hubert and Monica quickly doing similar. The rest of the Eagles moved too, rapidly realizing their professor was completely serious about there being a very real danger, especially when she took steps to push anyone who wasn’t moving quickly enough to hurry back to the cathedral.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The danger made itself known to the students as they saw a swarm of meteors coming down from the heavens, crashing down onto the monastery. The boulders launched earlier felt like pebbles in comparison to the damage done by each meteor that landed, immense conflagrations erupting all around the monastery. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the students ran across the bridge, Byleth tried to get her students to move as quickly as they could, one final meteor coming down directly towards the bridge. Hearing a scream, she looked back to see Dorothea on the floor having tripped. Not wasting a moment, she ran back to grab her, helping her up just as the meteors hit the bridge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Gritting her teeth, Byleth moved as fast as she could, grabbing onto Dorothea with one hand and the Sword of the Creator with the other. As the bridge began to crumble, she swung her sword, the segmented blade extending as they fell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Clinging onto the mercenary, Dorothea couldn't help but scream, certain she was about to die. A sense of self-loathing hit her at the thought of having caused Byleth’s death as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't let go," Byleth said, her tone steady even while Dorothea couldn't feel any ground beneath her…and yet, she didn't feel like she was falling. Slowly opening her eyes, she looked around, and saw that she and Byleth were hanging in the air, the Sword of the Creator wrapped around one of the stone poles that hadn't gotten destroyed. "Try not to move too much either." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...r-right. Right.” Dorothea let out a shaky laugh, keeping her arms wrapped tight around Byleth. “I’ll do my best…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good.” Byleth kept her own grip tight on her sword, her finger fixed firmly to its hilt. She wasn’t quite sure if her plan would work, but she didn’t have many other options, so she willed the blade to start retracting. But instead of the blade getting pulled back towards the hilt, the hilt began pulling her up towards the blade.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Okay good, it worked. She let out a small sigh, glad she was able to save on a charge for later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Up above them she could hear panicked screams, calling out to the two, before they changed into one's of relief as Byleth made it up to the edge, helping Dorothea up onto the bridge before climbing up herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you two okay?!" She heard her students calling, as the pair were helped up. Moving into the Cathedral, Byleth glanced behind herself at the monastery. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"This is horrifying…" Marianne managed to sum up her thoughts simply enough as she stared out at the destruction before her. She couldn't see the entire monastery, but she could see fires spreading across the grounds and smoke billowed out into the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shaking her head, Byleth moved into the cathedral, looking for someone specifically, though she did pause for a brief moment when she noticed a horse was in the cathedral, before she spotted Flayn sitting against a wall. Running towards her, Byleth knelt down by her. "Flayn, are you okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor? What happened?" the young girl asked, seemingly exhausted. She didn't look worn out from using her magic too much, she just seemed…tired. Byleth felt a bitter taste in her mouth as she was reminded that Flayn was probably in a battle like this, probably even one far more dangerous in the past. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Everyone's okay, we're going to focus on getting everyone out, okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is Seteth okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Seteth is smart, he knows how to take care of himself. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll see him soon enough. I just need you to promise me something." Byleth said, reaching down to grab her hand. "Please keep everyone safe, okay? Please, from one Nabatean to another." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That got Flayn to blink in surprise. "...Did Lady Rhea tell you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Something like that. And I have a lot of questions to ask when I get back, so make sure to stay safe, okay?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, where are you going?" Flayn asked, trying to grab onto her hand before Byleth pulled away, already heading back to the broken bridge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m going back to get my family. I promise, I’ll be back soon.” With that, she began running, ignoring the voices of her students for a moment in favor of sprinting towards the shattered bridge and swinging her sword out as she leapt, now using the blade to pull herself across the gap in a planned move instead of a moment of desperation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Landing on the other side, Byleth let out a sigh, ready to fight. Up until an axe sank into the wall a few feet away from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"YOUR MAJESTY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?" Blinking, Byleth turned around and felt her eyes widen as she saw Edelgard taking a running leap across the gap. Byleth felt that if her heart beat it would have stilled as she saw Edelgard practically fly over the gap, before she began to fall. Throwing herself forward, Byleth grabbed onto her outstretched hand before the Emperor could plummet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ask me after you pull me up, my teacher,” Edelgard requested, smiling despite the situation. With a small grunt, Byleth pulled her up. "Thank you, now I hope you forgive me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"For jump–" A smack sounded out as Edelgard slapped Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor, you need to listen to your sister more. You can't handle everything on your own." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth blinked. She stared at Edelgard, then blinked again because she’d just felt the strangest thump in her chest when she was slapped and had no idea what to feel right now. "...Can you help me find Shez so I can apologize?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Gladly, my teacher," Edelgard agreed, before offering her hand to Byleth. With a small smile, Byleth took it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Across the broken bridge, Dorothea let out a sigh as she leaned against a wall, watching her classmates, and Monica, panic over what just happened while Ferdinand and Hubert tried to restore order. "I can't believe I'm in love with those two dummies. Though I guess that just means I'm the bigger idiot." </span>

  <span>Myson smiled as he took a slow breath in through his nose. “Do you smell that, Odesse?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Burning flesh, sir?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but not quite. It’s the reek of devastation. Of our long awaited triumph over the beasts that stole our lands. Today…we butcher every last one of those abominations and put an end to the false faith of the so-called goddess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Odesse nodded beneath his new mask, now wearing the armor of the Flame Emperor over his Acheron guise. Because what was a plan worth if it wasn’t used, even with the occasional inconvenience? “Indeed we shall, my lord! Though, what of the hegemon? She is present in the monastery, is she not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She is, and if she dies, then so be it. It will be more convenient for us in the long run, really. Though if she survives, I have other plans. Dolofonos should be releasing Duke Aegir soon enough, and once Bergliez, Hevring, and Varley are dead, she’ll have lost her allies among the ministers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Er, sir, pardon my contradiction, but wasn’t Varley one of ours?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Was he? Huh. Well, if he was, he clearly wasn’t important enough to keep alive if I forgot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As you say, sir.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson nodded to himself, watching the chaos unfolding as the fields around the town were crushed under flame and rock, before glancing over to the caster who unleashed such devastation, who was clutching her knees and panting with exertion as she tried to keep herself standing. “Oh Bias, you didn’t die. A successful trial then!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“F-Fuck you too, Myson,” Bias grunted, sweat pouring down her head as the circlet she wore gleamed in the fire light. It wasn’t the only piece of jewelry on her; her hands and arms were covered in crest-stone embedded artificial bone. A similar choker encircled her throat, acting as a collar for the fettered sage. “Th-That…That took a lot from me…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fascinating…preliminary trials did show a high cost associated with the high power used, though the fact you survived…well, I can’t help but wonder, are you able to continue?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...C-Can’t cast anything like that again…can’t even say it would kill me, I just physically can’t. The magic’s out of reach…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Truly fascinating. We should keep that in mind then. It’s not exactly a replacement for the orbital defense missiles, but it is something to keep in mind.” He took a mental note of how she appeared to be bleeding from her eyes. Then a small frown came to his face as he took note of the cracks in the gems set in her jewelry. One of which fractured entirely and crumpled free from her wrist. “Hm. It seems the amplifiers have a limit too. How unfortunate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“S-So no more than once with these, huh? Feh, you make some shoddy shit, Myson.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He chuckled. “I’ll allow that for now, Bias. You did do excellent work with my ‘shoddy’ craftsmanship. Do you think you could finish the job though? Put the rest of the town to the torch with your natural magic, perhaps? I’m sure Chilon and Anaximandros would appreciate the help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would I want to help those pricks?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps for a sense of satisfaction as you burn down everything the beasts built?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...doesn’t feel that satisfying, honestly,” she muttered, staring at the destruction with a dull gaze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Shame. Ah well. Odesse, give the signal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, of course sir!” Odesse promptly raised a hand and launched a bolt of darkness upwards. It wasn’t nearly as impressive of a spell as Meteor, just a burst of darkness against the sky. It did, however, serve as a signal to the other Agarthan forces.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with mighty howls of vicious rage, the demonic beasts were unleashed. The enormous monsters tore free of the cages they were brought in and charged the shattered gates, uncaring of any soldiers in their way as they barreled into the ruined, burning town.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were joined soon enough by their flying counterparts, who began flying at whatever pegasi and wyverns they could get at, while a group of large knights in pitch-black armor stood as one and began to warp up to the walls, heeding their orders and cutting down everyone in their master’s way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What a beautiful day,” Myson remarked, smiling as smoke began to smother the sky and dye it a lovely crimson.</span>

  <p>“Damn, this is getting bad,” Claude muttered under his breath, trying to keep an eye out for his friends among the smoke and fire. He spotted Ingrid flying off, which was a very bad sign, and a glance down showed a shock of red hair riding away too. “And the brave lions are turning tail…not a bad idea, honestly.”</p><p> </p><p>First things first though, he should at least try to find his friends. He’d had a better chance of surviving with them, after all, and he’d probably used up most of his luck already managing to avoid all those meteors…that, and he actually liked his fellow deer enough to want them to make it out of there. So down he flew, trying to avoid the other fliers fighting in the sky, though he did have to shoot down a few blue pegasus knights on the way. While the door to the entrance hall was crumbled, the gaping hole from the meteor left Claude enough space for him to dive through the burning rubble.</p><p> </p><p>"Anyone here!?" Claude shouted as he looked around. </p><p> </p><p>He heard some faint shouting under some rubble. Turning back towards the entrance, he moved towards it, grabbing onto the debris as he and his wyvern helped dig someone out. Underneath he found Shez huddled over an unconscious Lysithea. </p><p> </p><p>"H-Help…" Shez managed to get out, getting Claude to grimace as he saw the blood leaking from her head. Moving quickly, he helped them out, giving Shez a hand to get up. </p><p> </p><p>"Shit, this doesn't look good," he muttered, seeing Shez barely able to stand, while Lysithea seemed to have a broken arm. </p><p> </p><p>"Wh-Where's Manuela?" Shez asked, as Claude helped her walk. </p><p> </p><p>"Over by the barracks, come on, give me Lysithea," Claude said, taking the mage from Shez to lift her up on his wyvern. Though as he turned around, he saw Shez standing still, before suddenly straightening up. "Uh, you good Shez?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. You go on ahead, I need to find the Ashen Dragon." </p><p> </p><p>“What?” He immediately frowned, his eyes narrowing. “Why would you call your sister–”</p><p> </p><p>Shez didn’t reply, instead vanishing in a burst of strangely fiery shadows.</p><p> </p><p>“...Damn it, this really isn’t the time for Shez to go crazy…” He sighed, before pausing as his wyvern nudged him, looking uncomfortable being inside the crumbling building. “Yeah, we should get Lysithea out of here. I doubt you like all this heat and dust either…then again, you guys live in deserts–”</p><p> </p><p>The wyvern chuffed.</p><p> </p><p>“Right, let’s get going.” Hopefully he could find Shez soon. </p><hr /><p>Jeralt was in hell. He’d been on battlefields before, spent most of his life moving from one to another, but none of them hit the same level of hellishness as the burning landscape he now found himself in. The fact that it was the monastery, his home for centuries, just added to how shit everything felt.</p><p> </p><p>Then again, that might be his own ancient body straining to keep itself together after all the exertion he’d already gone through. Being flat on his aching back wasn’t helping things either, especially with the ringing in his ears.</p><p> </p><p>The fact that he didn't know where his kids were only added to it all. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey Captain, you alive around here?!” Well at least Victor survived. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I'm here," he huffed, pushing himself up as he saw Victor approaching. "Where's everyone else?" </p><p> </p><p>"Keeping people safe. I was the only one brave enough to come and find you!" Victor said, laughing as he clapped the captain on his back. </p><p> </p><p>"Good to know everyone's okay. Have you seen Byleth or Shez?" </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, last I saw the deer kids were by the entrance hall? Shez is probably with them." </p><p> </p><p>“Right. We’re going there then. I’m finding my kids.”</p><p> </p><p>“You got it, captain. We find the kids, get everyone else that’s alive together, and get out of here,” Victor agreed, nodding to Jeralt before handing him a lance, earning a small grin from the captain.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks. Come on, let’s see if everyone is alright.”</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t, obviously. Meteors raining down on the monastery meant people were going to die, and he felt a grimace come to his face when he saw knights he recognized broken on the ground, blood staining their formerly white armor.</p><p> </p><p>“Captain, Vic! There you are!” came a familiar voice, and Jeralt felt a slight increase in his mood when he saw Candace riding over, atop a familiar steed.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey Candace. Thanks for bringing Argo,” Jeralt greeted, a small smile on his face as his horse moved over to him with a happy neigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, of course! Not like I’m gonna leave the big boy behind, he’s practically part of the family!” she replied with a cheerful grin that didn’t really fit the situation. But hey, it was nice to see anyway. “Don’t worry, I made sure to get the other horses outta there too. Even helped that blue-haired girl get hers over to the cathedral!”</p><p> </p><p>“...I’m glad you have your priorities in order, Candace," Jeralt muttered as she hopped off his horse. "Now come on, we have to find my kids before we leave."</p><p> </p><p>"Got it!" With a salute, the trio got ready to move, before something appeared before them. Standing upright, a figure clad in black armor and soaked in blood turned its gaze towards them. Even missing an arm, the figure didn't seem any less imposing as it lifted its remaining arm, aiming its axe at them. </p><p> </p><p>"Move!" Jeralt shouted, bringing up his lance to catch the haft of the axe before it could sink into his head. Gritting her teeth, he pushed back against the monster as his lieutenants moved to flank it. With a roar, the two attacked, Candace shoving her spear into the opening where its arm once was, as Victor split its head in two. </p><p> </p><p>The creature seemed to shudder for a moment, before it let out a guttural strangled roar, flailing about and sending the mercenaries back. </p><p> </p><p>"Captain, what the hell is this thing!?" Candace asked, bringing her fists up since her spear was still in the monster.</p><p> </p><p>"How am I supposed to know!?" Jeralt shouted back, keeping his eyes on the monster, as it charged back in. </p><p> </p><p>"Well if this thing kills me I expect a raise!" Running in as Jeralt did his best to defend, Victor aimed his axe to cleave off the creature's legs, only for it to vanish. Staring wide eyed, Jeralt noticed a shadow. Looking up, he saw the monster somehow above them, plunging down to drive its axe into him. </p><p> </p><p>Up until a scythe went spinning through the air, jamming into its back and sending the creature flying across the yard to smash into a bloodied pulp against a mound of rubble.</p><p> </p><p>"TO THINK I WOULD HAVE SO MANY WORTHY OPPONENTS HERE!" And things took a turn for the worse as a familiar opponent appeared, astride an armored horse. "I MUST THANK MY MASTER FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY!" </p><p> </p><p>Scowling, Jeralt got ready to face off against the Death Knight, prepared for whatever he did. </p><p> </p><p>"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?" Up until the voice of the Emperor cut in, getting the Death Knight to stiffen. Turning their heads, everyone there saw Edelgard and Byleth rapidly approaching.</p><p> </p><p>"MASTER? I AM FULFILLING OUR CONTRACT–"</p><p> </p><p>"The contract is canceled! There is no third mission!" </p><p> </p><p>"...OH." The heavily armored knight seemed sheepish, almost fidgeting in his saddle as his horse shuffled anxiously in response to his awkwardness. “I…SEE.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Kid, what's going on?" Jeralt asked, looking at Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"I'll explain later. I'm glad to see you're okay, Papa," Byleth said, before stepping in close to hug him. </p><p> </p><p>"...Glad to see you're okay too," Jeralt replied, hugging her back. He glanced at Edelgard berating Jeritza. "...we're still going to talk about this later." </p><p> </p><p>"Good news captain, this thing is dead!" Candace said, ripping her spear out of the formerly undead creature. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, lucky shot I guess," Victor muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"THERE IS NO LUCK. I FOUGHT ONE WHILE COMING HERE, THEY HAVE A WEAKNESS," the knight stated, moving over to the creature, and ripped his scythe out of it. At the end of the blade was a cracked orb, the weapon having pierced it. </p><p> </p><p>"What is that?" Edelgard muttered, looking at the orb, before the cracks spread and shattered. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, whatever it is, at least we know where to aim," Jeralt noted, frowning at the corpse, wary that it might move again. </p><p> </p><p>"Better than nothing I guess,” Victor huffed as they got ready to move. Letting go of Jeralt, Byleth moved to lead the group, ready to find the rest of the mercenaries and Shez, before she noticed someone shuffling towards them. </p><p> </p><p>Her eye widened when she saw Shez walking towards her, soaked in blood and shambling about as if in a daze. "SHEZ!" Running forward, she grabbed onto her sister, helping her stand as she began to heal her. Byleth could hear the others scrambling behind her, trying to get a good look at Shez, while the purple-haired mercenary mumbled something. "What? What happened?" </p><p> </p><p>A loud roar pierced through the monastery, getting everyone to stiffen and look at the unexpected sight of a white-scaled dragon emerging from the burning monastery, its wings spreading wide as it tore free of the rubble. Roaring again, it flew into the air with a number of black armored monsters clinging onto it, trying to stab or cut into its body. </p><p> </p><p>"Got you." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth let out a cough, feeling something warm running down her chin while the same warm feeling covered her chest. Looking down, she saw her sister, smiling gleefully as she plunged her sword into her. </p><p> </p><p>Genuine confusion hit her before anything else. Because what she was seeing wasn’t possible. It just wasn’t–</p><p> </p><p>“Turn back time, now!” Sothis yelled in her ear, and Byleth felt a tug on her body as her ability activated on instinct, pulling her back before she’d taken the blade to the chest. </p><p> </p><p>She was still close to her sister, she was still healing Shez, but this time her arms shot out, catching Shez’s wrist before the blade could form.</p><p> </p><p>“Tch. Cheater.” </p><p> </p><p>Her sister’s voice sounded wrong. There was some distortion in it, like another person was speaking with her voice– “Arval?”</p><p> </p><p>She spoke without thinking, the idea coming to her in a sudden rush. She knew Shez had a spirit following her, just like Sothis; she’d even had that spirit with her for much longer than Byleth had hers. So it was the only thought that made sense.</p><p> </p><p>“Not quite.” It was still wrong though. The thing wearing her sister’s face smiled. It was a cruel smile, malice dripping from the expression. Then it dropped entirely, back to a cold focus. “I am Epimenides. And you, Fell Star, will meet your end today.”</p><p> </p><p>And with that, the pair of them vanished, earning a panicked shout from Jeralt when they disappeared from his sight.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth stumbled, not expecting the sudden rush of her sister’s ability to vanish at will. She found her footing and felt a flash of recognition as she realized they were at the training hall–Then she had to raise her sword, catching Shez’s blade before it could pierce her chest again.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth had sparred with her sister before. She knew how Shez fought. And Epimenides knew how she fought too. </p><p> </p><p>Their strikes came lightning fast, each swing and stab moving fluidly from one to another in a rapid onslaught, intent on cutting Byleth down before she could react. The problem was, Byleth knew exactly how to react; every cut was blocked, each stab deflected, and when she saw an opening, she–</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t take it. How could she? This was her sister.</p><p> </p><p>“Shez, I know you’re in there!” she called out, her sword a moving wall as she blocked every single strike from her foe, “I know you can take back control–”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course she’s in here,” Epimenides stated, stilling his onslaught for a moment to regard Byleth with another cold gaze. He placed a hand on his chest. “Shez is my partner. She is aware of what I am doing. And she approves.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t lie to me.” There was no hesitation in Byleth’s voice. She didn’t believe that claim for a second. “Let her go. Now.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides scoffed. “You arrogant abomination. Do you truly think you understand the depths of rage in my partner’s heart? You, who so readily abandoned her for the sake of others?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think my sister loves me. I love her.” Byleth met the sage’s gaze, her eye narrowed. “And your hand is trembling.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides paused, glanced at the hand clenched around his sword and scowled when he saw its grip faltering. “A foolish sentimentality. She will learn better.”</p><p> </p><p>"What is your problem? What did Sothis even do to you!" Byleth demanded to know, getting Epimenides to glare at her. </p><p> </p><p>“She stole this world from us. My people once dwelled in glory. We would have burned as bright as the sun and <em> you took it all! </em>” he suddenly shouted, appearing right in front of Byleth and swinging his sword at her head.</p><p> </p><p>She caught the blade with the Sword of the Creator, then felt another rush as they suddenly warped, her feet catching on the tiles of the roof. The pair of them exchanged blows, Epimenides striking to kill while Byleth remained defensive and unwilling to harm her sister, before another roar caught their attention.</p><p> </p><p>The white dragon screeched up in the sky as demonic beasts tried to swarm it, their teeth managing to catch on its flesh, though its retaliation was swift and brutal. Its claws rent through flesh while blasts of light scoured through the dark monsters, ripping them from the air, before its head reared back and light began to gather in its maw.</p><p> </p><p>“Filthy beast…” Epimenides growled, his face a rictus of hatred at the sight of his ancient foe, before he turned back to Byleth. “Do you see!? Do you see what they are!? Nothing more than monsters, abominations cloaking themselves in human flesh! They dare take our shape when they are nothing more than arrogant animals!”</p><p> </p><p>“You went to her birthday party,” Byleth retorted, sword at the ready.</p><p> </p><p>“I was not speaking to <em> you </em>,” Epimenides sneered, before charging at Byleth again as the beam of light lit up the sky, scouring the monsters that tried to swarm the Immaculate One.</p><p> </p><p>Their blades clashed and when they warped again, Byleth had a moment to steady herself as she found herself on the couch of the knight's barracks, before being kicked back by Epimenides. </p><p> </p><p>"Woah!" Someone yelled as she crashed onto the ground, before flipping upright as Epimenides tried to stab her. Looking around, she could see several wounded in the barracks being tended to, with one class in particular inside. "Teach, Shez? What's going on?" </p><p> </p><p>"Shez is being controlled by magic, watch out!" Byleth managed to warn in time as Claude took a step forward, Lorenz grabbing him by his collar and pulling him back before he could get cut down by Epimenides. </p><p> </p><p>"Come to think of it, I might as well clear out the beasts trying to control this land," Epimenides decided, turning his gaze to the nobles of the Deer, who stiffened at the genuine malice in their friend’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Shez, I don't know what's going on, but we’re here for you. Whatever this is, I’m sure you can fight it!" Manuela stated, moving protectively in front of the students and making the sage scowl. Though before he could say anything, he was forced to swing his sword to cut apart a weak Seraphim launched at his vessel. </p><p> </p><p>"L-Leave my apprentice alone…" Lysithea managed to get out, breathing heavily from the cot she was laid out on. </p><p> </p><p>“Contemptible beast. You dare proclaim yourself the master of my–” A jolt went up the sage’s arm, making Epimenides scowl. “Stop fighting me! You know these beasts are worthless! Nothing more than filth, laying claim to lands they have no right to!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I don’t see your name on it!” Raphael called out, “Which the nobles actually do have! Right?”</p><p> </p><p>“...well that is actually accurate,” Lorenz noted, nodding thoughtfully, “My surname is the name of my territory–”</p><p> </p><p>“Is now really the time, guys?” Hilda asked, before stepping forward, “Look, whoever you are, leave Shez alone! I don’t know how you’re controlling her–”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not controlling her. I am her partner, she is my vessel, and you filthy beasts have no claim to her!” Epimenides snapped, white markings spreading over more of Shez’s skin as his rage grew.</p><p> </p><p>"Ha, if you were her actual partner she would have told us about you! Guess you aren't that important to her!" Balthus taunted, making Epimenides rage spike even further. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, as far as we can tell, you're just some obsessed weirdo!" Leonie further taunted. </p><p> </p><p>"Shez is our friend, and we aren't just going to let you take her." </p><p> </p><p>"Well you heard them," Claude said, following off of Ignatz, "I don't know what your problem is, but we'd like you to leave Shez out of it." </p><p> </p><p>Epimenides growled, about to attack, before he was suddenly grappled from behind by Byleth. "Let go of me, you abomination!" </p><p> </p><p>“I’m here. I’m here, Shez, I’m here for you,” Byleth murmured, her voice quiet and soothing as Epimenides felt his body still for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>Then he snarled and pulled on the dark powers that were his to command, vanishing again with the Fell Star in tow.</p><p> </p><p>Pushing her off as they landed in the town, Epimenides could still hear the sounds of battle raging out as he turned to face Byleth. "I'm going to enjoy killing all of you." </p><p> </p><p>"Shez?" a surprised voice said, getting the pair to look over and see Ashe standing nearby. </p><p> </p><p>"Don't get near her Ashe, it's dangerous!" Byleth said, moving in front of him. "Where's the rest of the Lions?" </p><p> </p><p>"W-We got separated, I was trying to catch up to them," Ashe explained, the young boy looking between the two in confusion. </p><p> </p><p>"Then you best just scurry away. That's all you beasts are good for. Though, where would you even run to? Your father is dead, after all. Murdered by the one trying to protect you now," Epimenides taunted, sneering with Shez’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Ashe stiffened, his grip on his bow trembling–</p><p> </p><p>“Stop that. Don’t mock him,” Byleth ordered, glaring at Epimenides.</p><p> </p><p>The sage stared at her for a moment, before that cruel smile appeared on his face for just a second. He straightened, his visage cold and callous. “So again you defend everyone else. You said it yourself, Fell Star. That beast’s father <em> murdered </em> my partner, and yet you defend him? But then, you don’t care, do you? You’ve only made her life worse from that first moment you shot an arrow into her side.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth flinched, but moved when Epimenides vanished again, catching his blade on her own and bracing herself as they warped again, her feet landing on solid stone again.</p><p> </p><p>“–just need to get to Abyss, Yuri’s organizing–wha-?”</p><p> </p><p>“Shez?” Dimitri paused, ceasing his struggles for a moment when he recognized his former classmate. Dedue and Gilbert paused too, their grip on his limbs loosening as they saw Byleth and Shez exchanging blows, the sisters’ swords clashing again and again.</p><p> </p><p>There were more exclamations of shock and surprise as Epimenides leapt away from Byleth and landed on a piece of rubble, regarding the Lions with interest. “Here we are. The first class my partner joined. The beasts that drew her into this vile place.”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you talking about?” Byleth asked, moving in front of the students on instinct, ready to shield them in case Epimenides attacked.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor? What the hell is going on?!” Felix exclaimed, staring between the two of them in confused shock.</p><p> </p><p>“A good question, scion of Fraldarius,” Epimenides remarked, and the Lions present all stiffened at the unfamiliar voice speaking with Shez’s mouth, “You see, Fell Star, I thought it best to impart some truths. You already know what <em> you </em> are. The false goddess incarnated, the vessel of a monstrosity that invaded this world millennia ago. But do you know what they are? Do you have any idea why these beasts hold the power they do?</p><p> </p><p>He looked almost bored. It was a deliberate affectation, an act of coldness and composure. Everyone there could see the fiery glow in their friend’s eyes, and the malice dripping from her blood-soaked body. “I gave it to them. These friends of yours? Their ancestors were my collaborators.”</p><p> </p><p>“...what?” Byleth stared at him, confused, yet…feeling a strange sense of dread. “What are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>“What does he mean…?” She heard Sothis say, the goddess’s voice echoing softly in Byleth’s ears.</p><p> </p><p>“The great hero Nemesis, the King of Liberation. Do you know what that brute liberated the world from? Do you know who he and his heroes stood against?” He spread his arms, as though encompassing the world. “They stood against you, Fell Star, and your abominations. They stood against Sothis and her Nabateans. They drank of their blood and used their bodies as weapons. And do you know who they have to thank for that?" </p><p> </p><p>Byleth felt her body shiver as she took a step back, as if afraid of what he was about to say. </p><p> </p><p>"It was pure speculation at first. Despite how detestable they were, it couldn't be denied that the Nabateans were stronger than we humans. We wondered if we could make that power our own, so of course we had to test it out. Beast though he was, I must admit that he was a useful guinea pig. After all, he helped show how strong my masterpiece is." He smiled at Byleth. "It's truly a shame I wasn't able to kill you myself, but defiling you and your children's corpse more than made up for it." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth felt dizzy, as if she was about to collapse. Beside her she could see Sothis grabbing her head, clearly in some kind of pain. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, but don't worry, you still have at least one child," Epimenides said, pointing up at the Immaculate One in the sky. "For now, that is. I wonder just what kind of weapon I could fashion from her…oh I know, I'll make a sword out of her spine! It will pair quite wonderfully with yours." </p><p> </p><p>Something snapped. Byleth wasn't sure what exactly, but the next thing she knew she was being yanked backwards. Shaking her head, she was able to focus and saw…herself. </p><p> </p><p>"I'LL KILL YOU!" The green-haired Byleth shouted, charging forward at Epimenides. </p><p> </p><p>With a grin that seemed almost manic, Epimenides clashed blades with Sothis. </p><p> </p><p>And all around them, the air burned with emerald flames and violet shadows.</p><hr /><p>The fields outside the walls of Garreg Mach were a place of chaos. Soldiers garbed in white and blue clashed across the burnt grass and bloodied dirt while knights in black armor slaughtered any who lacked the blood of Agartha. What was once a peaceful landscape had become a brutal battlefield, and in a flash of shadow, the battle became all the more chaotic.</p><p> </p><p>Thunder boomed when the Great Sage Epimenides and the Goddess Sothis clashed blade against blade.</p><p> </p><p>"I'll enjoy ending your life!" Epimenides shouted, flashing behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Turning on her heel, Sothis blocked his blade, glaring at the sage. "You'll beg for forgiveness by the time I'm done." </p><p> </p><p>Scowling, Epimenides flashed away, before a fully formed Luna appeared in his hands. With a yell, he launched it at Sothis, who met his spell with a Seraphim.</p><p> </p><p>"Is that all your wrath is worth? Incessant taunting and screaming?" Sothis asked, walking forward, her eye alight with divine rage. "You carved up my body once, and you cannot do it again. How pitiful." </p><p> </p><p>"Be silent, you wretched monstrosity!" Epimenides shouted, launching a slew of Dark Spikes at her, each one prematurely exploding as a wall of light appeared before Sothis, the Abraxas fading away as she glared imperiously. </p><p> </p><p>“You celebrate your humanity as though it is something glorious, yet what about you is human?” Sothis questioned, swinging her blade out and carving a furrow in the dirt that erupted with flames, forcing Epimenides back and causing the battling soldiers to break off from their fights, their eyes widening in shock, “You are an arrogant wraith clinging to a life that is not yours to take! And I shall not allow you to hurt these children any longer.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides scoffed. “What callous arrogance from a foul abomination! You came to our world, pretending at generosity, but all you wanted was subjects to worship your false divinity–!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh do be silent, you petulant creature,” Sothis ordered, the light in her eye glowing brighter as the soldiers on the field found themselves falling to their knees, suddenly aware of the divinity in their presence, “I demanded no worship. I gave without reservation and asked only for a home for my children in turn. One damned canyon was somehow too much for the great cities of Agartha to allow, and when you turned on one another and myself, you truly expected I would not retaliate in return?” </p><p> </p><p>The sneer of disgust looked out of place on Byleth’s face and Epimenides bristled to see it. “You–You had no right to our world! We made ourselves great! We needed no blessings from a monstrosity like you!”</p><p> </p><p>Sothis rolled her eye. “Congratulations then, you won. You did kill me, as you so readily taunted. One thousand years past, you butchered my sleeping body and made weapons of my bones and blessings of my blood. And then you did…what, precisely? I do not see a revived Thinis. The names Malum and Septen do not ring through history. Oh, and what of Llium? Is there a nation still existent with that name? No? And yet, you had made your own king? You slayed the Fell Star? You destroyed the Nabateans, you retook Fodlan! And yet…no, how could it be? </p><p> </p><p>Her own tone turned mocking, derision in every word. “You wasted your chance at revival in order to continue squirming in the depths of the earth, intent on nothing more than wallowing in your own sense of superiority until my daughter killed you. Yet here you are, just as I am, lingering long past the point that we should have died. So allow me to be the one to send you off.”</p><p> </p><p>“BE SILENT!” Epimenides roared, slamming his hand into the ground and causing it to erupt in massive pillars of jagged earth. </p><p> </p><p>Yet Sothis moved through them, time distorting around her as she stepped everywhere the stones weren’t. And when they threatened to smash into one of the knights, the armored soldier of the Kingdom found himself suddenly on clear dirt, some distance away.</p><p> </p><p>Moments later, more soldiers joined him, shock and surprise echoing out as knights of both the Kingdom and Church found themselves out of the way, saved by a divine hand.</p><p> </p><p>Then Sothis swung her sword and the erupting mountains were cleaved in half, dirt and rock spilling across the ground. </p><p> </p><p>Epimenides snarled, rage and fury burning in eyes that were not his own as the air twisted with darkness, rent asunder by his anger. Tyrants leapt at his call, the undead warriors following the order of the Great Sage’s blood, before falling to the ground in chunks, split apart by a blade that moved faster than eyes could follow. </p><p> </p><p>Epimenides stared, his eyes widening, before they narrowed again and he growled, the sound more bestial than man. In an instant, demonic beasts poured through the holes he made in the world, portals to bring the monstrosities charging at the goddess in human form. It took more than a single cut to put down the horrors made of humans, by Agarthan hands, but they still died all the same, slain by the approaching deity, whose gait had not once wavered.</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides stumbled. For the first time in a very long time, he felt genuine dread enter his heart. “...f-filth. You–You monstrous–”</p><p> </p><p>“You are a fool, o’ mortal man,” the goddess intoned, her blade burning with a holy light, “I would have gladly lived in peace, had you allowed it.” Sothis’s voice was little more than a whisper, yet it echoed across the field, bringing tears to the eyes of the soldiers there…and a snarl to the sage’s stolen face.</p><p> </p><p>“YOU INVADED OUR LAND! I CARE NOT WHAT GIFTS YOU CLAIM TO HAVE GIVEN! WE ARE THE GUARDIANS OF THIS WORLD, AND YOU ARE NOTHING BUT FILTH LEECHING FROM OUR GLORY!” he screamed, arms thrown wide as he called upon every dark power in his grasp.</p><p> </p><p>And in an instant, the goddess moved. Yet no sword swung.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Byleth wrapped her arms tightly around her sister, hugging her as hard as she could.</p><p> </p><p>The shadows cut off. The fiery light in her eyes faded. And the halos that bound Shez’s body disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>“...h-huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“I love you, Shez,” Byleth said, keeping her arms tight around her, “I’m sorry if I ever made you feel like I didn’t. You’re my sister and my best friend. You’re the first person that made me feel happy, sad, frustrated…having you around made me feel like a person instead of something broken.” She took a breath, tears pricking at her eye. “I promise, no matter what happens, you will always be my family.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez let out a shaky breath, a sob slipping out. “I…I know…I just…’m stupid…”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not. You’re my brilliant little sister.”</p><p> </p><p>Tears began rolling down her cheeks as she returned the hug, her eyes blurring with the emotions going through her…yet, despite the blur in her vision, she still noticed that Byleth had tossed aside the Sword of the Creator to hug her. And in an instant, Shez felt a surge of panic as all of Epimenides’s rage came roaring back. </p><p> </p><p>In one more flash, the two of them warped across the fields of Garreg Mach and wound up outside its main gate, startling the trio of Agarthans overlooking the devastation.</p><p> </p><p>“What in the–?” Myson began, his eyes widening.</p><p> </p><p>“The Fell Star?!” Bias exclaimed, her hand raising.</p><p> </p><p>"She's unarmed!" Epimenides shouted, pushing Byleth back and launching a dark spike at her. Jerking back, Byleth dodged the spell, only to get blasted by a pair of miasmas from Myson and Odesse. </p><p> </p><p>Scowling, Bias tried to cast a spell, only for nothing to come, her magic still dry after her giant meteor swarm. </p><p> </p><p>"Shez, please," Byleth called out, ignoring the pain in her body as she backed up against a wall, "You can win, I know you can!" </p><p> </p><p>Epimenides grit his teeth, trying to fight his disobedient partner while she tried to take control of her body. </p><p> </p><p>"Well well, I must admit, I didn't think you'd bring the Fell Star herself into our laps," Myson said, a grin on his face, "I suppose we really do owe you one, Great Sage." </p><p> </p><p>"Just kill her already!" </p><p> </p><p>"No, I don't think I shall, she's far more–" Whatever Myson was about to say was cut off as a giant roar sounded out. Looking upwards, the group saw the Immaculate One descending upon them, racing to crash into them.</p><p> </p><p>Moving quickly, the group managed to evade the dragon crashing into the wall, roaring with divine fury as it curled protectively around Byleth. Its eyes darted, taking in each of the Agarthans, before fixating on Epimenides and taking in the markings spread across Shez’s body. In an instant, the Immaculate One’s mouth opened wide, blue flames gathering before Byleth abruptly grabbed onto her.</p><p> </p><p>“NO! No, you can’t–”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha, sentimental fool,” Myson taunted, raising his hand as a Bohr gathered there.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s really trying to keep her safe?” Bias murmured, staring at the Fell Star’s attempt at protection.</p><p> </p><p>Odesse didn’t say anything. Instead, he choked, blood spilling from his mouth as the Great Sage Epimenides shoved his hand into the disguised Agarthan’s chest and crushed his heart.</p><p> </p><p>The world shuddered as the void answered the sage’s call. Darkness erupted around the point Byleth and the Immaculate One stood, encircling the both of them in an instant.</p><p> </p><p>And for a moment, Byleth felt a twist of fear in her…before she saw her sister. And where half of Shez’s face had been twisted in a rictus of triumphant hatred and fury, the other half was filled with heartbreak and sorrow.</p><p> </p><p>“...It’s okay,” Byleth said, giving her sister a reassuring smile, “Stay safe–”</p><p> </p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p> </p><p>And despite his triumph, despite his victory, Epimenides felt his control slip away entirely as his vessel fell to her knees, her despair burying him deep as she let out a wail of pure anguish.</p>

  <p>
  <span>Tears stinging her eyes, Shez pushed herself up and went to where her sister once stood, trying to find any trace of her. Despite her desperate search, she found nothing at all, the area devoid of all life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm, what a shame." She heard an Agarthan behind her say, "Not only did we fail to capture the Fell Star, but you also killed Odesse. So much for owing you one, Great Sage." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez felt Epimenides try to take over again, before she bit her lip, forcing him back down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm going to kill you," Shez stated, rage filling her body as she stood up, her sword forming in hand as she glared at the sage who spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, it seems the vessel has taken over again. Today truly is such a mess." Myson sighed, bringing his hand up to form a barrier to block Shez’s attempt to cut him down. "Now how shall you make it up to me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scowling, Shez moved back, trying to fight through her exhaustion with her rage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I know. We were going to capture the Fell Star and keep her alive for samples, but since we can't do that anymore, you'll just have to fill that role," Myson said, a smile on his face, "We'll need to amputate your limbs to make sure you can't escape, but don't worry, we'll keep you alive for as long as we can." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you…I’m not–Nh–” She gripped her head, before Epimenides straightened, letting out a sigh. “No need for that. My vessel is under my control–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he ducked, feeling the muscles of his body burn as the crackling mix of electricity and darkness that was the Bohr spell went straight over his head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I believe I already stated my intended course of action,” Myson remarked, already gathering up his magic for another blast, “A decrepit fossil is worth much more as material than another complication.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What–What are you talking about!? I am the–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re a relic from a bygone age. I have no need for another sage and I really would prefer keeping you as a test subject.” Myson shrugged. “That and you did kill Odesse, so I do want to mutilate you out of spite.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I am Epimenides, the Great Sage of Agartha–!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Technically you're more akin to a facsimile of the Great Sage,” Myson interrupted, “Epimenides died a tragic death against the abomination's kin. So if you truly wish to make things better for Agartha, then you will offer me your body so we can have replenishable materials for as long as you can last." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You traitorous swine!" Epimenides shouted, before ducking another blast. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sorry to say, but I'm loyal only to the Agastya of Agartha, and well." He stared at Epimenides' current form. "You're a bit…smaller than her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you really talking about Cleobulus' tits right now?" Bias asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They are her most recognizable feature,” Myson remarked, laughing to himself, "Besides, she shows them off so readily, so it's not like she'd mind." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Yeah, that’s fair.” Bias sighed, before glancing at Epimenides, who was glaring furiously at the pair of them. “What? Do you expect me to help? I couldn’t care less about some long dead sage. Especially when you decided to steal </span>
  <em>
    <span>my</span>
  </em>
  <span> vengeance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You–You petty, spiteful–!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias scoffed, rolling her eyes at the furious sage. “We’re Agarthan, you idiot. Of course we’re petty and spiteful. If you don’t know that, you really are out of touch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Weighing his options, Epimenides looked between the two, well aware that Myson was the bigger threat right now. Though before he could move, more Agarthans arrived, being led by a horse riding knight with fresh scars on his face. "I see you two are having trouble here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Only because we're trying to capture this one alive,” Myson replied, “I don't suppose you can help?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I make no promises," Anaximandros said, aiming his spear at Epimenides. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...All of you will suffer by my hands," Epimenides stated, genuine rage in his eyes, before he suddenly disappeared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm. What an annoying ability," Myson huffed, before glancing at Anaximandros, "Well, we can figure that out later. Care to report?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A large number of the kingdom forces have switched sides, but the forces at the monastery have already begun to evacuate. We may have lost the Tyrants we brought, but Chilon is searching the monastery for anyone still remaining." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm. Well hopefully he ends up dying." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Someone's angry," Bias muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well excuse me for having a bit of hope for something nice after losing Odesse and a prime source for materials," Myson complained, frowning as he looked at his dead assistant, "Make sure to take him back to Shambala to be buried." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re not going to try reviving him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Spell of Zahras is not one that you can be brought back from. It demands a life be sacrificed to the void to cast one’s enemies into the darkness.” He sighed, shaking his head in disappointment, before he clapped his hands together. “Ah well. Agnus, attend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a flash of a warp spell and the dark mage that appeared immediately bowed his head to his superior. “You called upon me, Lord Myson?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re the new Odesse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The mage straightened, surprised. “Oh! You honor me, my lord! I will do my best to uphold the name!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you will. Now then, let’s let Chilon wrap up his own venture, and then we can get to the important part. Looting!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That prompted a cheer from the knights and some chatter among the mages, excited by the prospect of robbing the monastery of its wealth and secrets.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should hope he hurries,” Bias pointed out, “Most of this shithole is on fire already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh, it's not like anything important is flammable." </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Edelgard could feel fire in her veins. Sweat beaded down her face, but her breath was still even. She kept a good grip of Labraunda in her grasp, its surface ablaze with her flames as she smashed it into and through the chest of a knight in full black armor, cleaving through flesh and bone and staining the ground red before she moved from his burning remains and split through another Agarthan mage. The entrance hall had been broken through, and there were few defenses between them and the cathedral. The rest of the monastery though…to call it ablaze was understating the conflagration it had become.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please tell me you have some idea on how to get out of here!" She heard Gertrude yell at Jeralt, the mercenary keeping close to her employer and launching bolts of light at anyone that got close.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not until we find my kids!" Jeralt shouted back, clashing against a knight, something Edelgard found herself agreeing with. Partially because she had somewhat hoped Shez would be able to warp them across the broken bridge, but mostly because she was worried about her professor. She had seen the look in Shez’s eyes before they disappeared and whatever was in there looked far too cruel to be the younger Eisner sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re not gonna find them in all this smoke!” Victor called out, “We gotta be smart about this, Captain!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The hell is that supposed to mean!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not saying we just run, I’m saying–Princess, you got a place you and Byleth were supposed to meet or what?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We were retreating to the cathedral before the bridge was destroyed!” she shouted in reply, “We’ll have to look for an alternate route!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping you had a better answer than that!” Victor complained, “What about you, Captain?! Do you know about any secret passages!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How the hell are Byleth and Shez going to find us if we start crawling through secret passages!?” Jeralt snapped, though there was an undercurrent of desperation beneath the anger in his voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They're smart, if they can't meet up with us, then they'll probably just head to the Empire themselves!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Victor’s right, for once!” Ezra called out, his eyes scanning the courtyard for any sign of more enemies, “You know those two can take care of themselves!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt grit his teeth, his grip tight on the spear in his grasp. Yet the desperate fear in his eyes was what prompted Edelgard to move up to him, placing a hand on his arm. “Captain Jeralt, Professor Byleth has been to the palace of Enbarr. She knows the route there, and you know she would protect Shez no matter what happens. I don’t know what occurred to cause Shez to warp away like that, but I’m sure we’ll see both of them soon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I can’t lose them,” he replied, his haunted gaze reminding her of her own father, “Not my kids. I can’t lose my kids.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You won’t. I promise.” At her words, Jeralt’s jaw clenched, before he slowly nodded. Nodding in return, she turned to Jeritza. "Jeritza, find a way to the Cathedral, tell everyone there to begin evacuating, and that we'll meet outside the monastery." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"VERY WELL." The Death Knight agreed, before galloping off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You're going to need a good explanation for why he's working for you," Jeralt said, frowning at the Death Knight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I swear, once we're safe, I'll–" Then she stiffened as a crawling sensation went down her back. There was something out there–Then she saw him. A man in the silver armor of a Great Knight, lined with blue, though his right hand appeared to be covered in a distorted relic, its bone-like material an ashen black and the core set in it appeared to be missing a crest while its surface was a muddy brown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>More significant though was the full relic weapon in the man’s hand. It was an ugly thing that could loosely be called an axe, its “blade” resembling a curled wing with sharpened spikes on the inside, almost like the jaws of a beast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There you are, you rebellious brat,” the man growled. She could feel the glare through his helm as he strode forward, walking with heavy steps that seemed to shake the earth. “You’ve been allowed free rein for too long.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, looks like one of the bosses came out to deal with us personally. I'm flattered," Ezra muttered, ready to throw his knife. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if I care about vermin like you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And just who exactly are you?" Edelgard asked, readying herself for battle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. And here I thought you might recognize me, you stupid brat,” the sage growled as he focused on Edelgard, "Though, I suppose you were always cowering in the corner of the dungeon, even as I dragged the bodies away." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard’s eyes widened, as a memory flashed in her head of an armored knight in full black plate dragging away her younger sister's corpse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Captain Jeralt, I'm going to have to ask that you leave this to me," Edelgard requested, taking a step towards the Agarthan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Jeralt almost argued, before noticing the look in her eyes. "...Make it quick." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you. Now, if I may, what is your actual name?" Edelgard asked as she brought her shield up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Chilon, Sage of the Earth and wielder of Aymr, the greatest relic crafted by Agarthan hands." As he boastfully introduced himself, Edelgard felt her mouth twitch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Chilon…if memory serves me correctly, you were Thales' personal guard. Before he died, that is." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Immediately, the sage growled. "Keep his name out of-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Would you like to know how he died?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What?" Tightening his grip on his relic, he pointed the axe at Edelgard. "Don’t you dare lie to me, you little wretch. How could you possibly know that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I asked my professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What does the Fell Star have to do with this?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, she has a lot to do with it. It's a funny story really. You see, when she was around…oh, let's say, fourteen or fifteen years old, she was practicing her magic. At the prompting of her younger sister, she even showed off her prowess with Faith Magic. Now, despite her young age, she was quite skilled at Faith Magic. So much so that she caused a landslide in the Oghma Mountains." At that, she smirked. "Now, if I remember correctly, that irredeemable bastard had his head smashed in the Oghma Mountains, didn't he?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You wretch!” Chilon spat, outraged, “How dare you insult your betters!? You wouldn’t be anything of worth were it not for our aid!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would have had a whole family. I don’t care about what power you ‘granted’.” She hefted her axe and shield, ready to fight. “But if you insist I should repay your ‘generosity’, then I will gladly return every bit of agony you inflicted on my family.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! I am the Sage of Earth, the greatest warrior of the Agarthan people!” he declared, bringing his axe into a ready position, his gaze completely focused on her, “Do you truly believe you can kill me on your own?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…that’s a fair point. Gertrude, would you mind?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sage paused, his eyes narrowing in confusion at the sudden, polite request, right before a bolt of light exploded right in his face. Chilon stumbled back with a scream of shock and pain as he was blinded, his free hand clutching at his face as he swung his axe wildly–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a flash of heat and pain as Chilon felt inexplicably lighter. His vision cleared and he swung again, realizing too late that his hand had been completely severed from his arm in one swift swing. The wound was already cauterized by Edelgard’s blazing axe, which swung straight into his chest in a vicious horizontal cut that smashed deep into his sternum and sent blood spraying from his mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He tried to move, to raise his shield, and found himself bereft of his entire left arm before a foot smashed into his knee, cracking bone. Chilon howled, pain and fury pushing him forward, trying to call on the might of his people to end the wretched failure that wounded him!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A feat that was largely impossible given his lack of hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he was on his back and his helmet was torn off, his eyes meeting the cold gaze of the Emperor of Adrestia.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And yet, the sage remained defiant. "Do you expect me to beg!? I will never stoop so low as to cower before a failure like you! I swear, I will have my vengeance for this humiliation!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Fine then. I'll give you a chance." She placed the blade of Labraunda on his throat. "Name one of my siblings, and I'll let you have a chance for revenge." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if I would remember failures like them!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very well then.” And without a moment’s hesitation, Edelgard lifted the axe and swung it straight through the Sage of Earth’s neck, splitting his head from his body as his eyes still stared in disbelief at his own demise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Staring down at him, Edelgard let out a small sigh of relief. She still had so much work before her, but…in this moment, it felt easier to breathe. She wondered if she managed to bring some peace to her family with this monster’s death... </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No wonder your daughter is into her,” Candance commented from behind the emperor, giving Jeralt a nudge with her elbow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Candace.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? I’m just saying, if I was her age–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Candace.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard huffed, faintly amused by the mercenaries’ antics. “We should probably get going now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, you did just kill one of their bosses, so I’m pretty sure we’ll be in trouble if we stick around,” Ezra pointed out, “Well, with Gertrude’s assistance, of course–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need to praise me, dove,” Gertrude remarked, amused, before glancing at the corpse, “Ah, your highness? Or, wait, it would be majesty now…ah, either way, should we take that axe he had? It looks like one of those relic things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? I suppose,” Edelgard considered, glancing back at the discarded weapon. “Monica might be upset if I start using a new axe so soon after she found me one though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can I have it then?” Victor asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’d die, dumbass,” Ezra pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I might not. Who knows? I could be–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll hold onto it,” Jeralt decided, grabbing the axe and hoisting it over his shoulder with surprising ease, “Let’s just…get out of here for now. Though I’m coming back here if my kids don’t show up at that palace of yours, emperor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Edelgard readily agreed, nodding to her professor’s father. Who might become her father-in-law in the future. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…Just something to consider.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Claude had to admit, retreating was far more bitter than he expected. Maybe it had to do with how injured his classmates were, or how they hadn't been able to find Shez, but nothing about fleeing the monastery felt good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on, the sooner we get to my family's territory, the sooner we can figure out what to do," Lorenz said, leading the group on horseback, his usual pomp and flair gone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about Shez?” Lysithea murmured from her place on the back of Lorenz’s horse, her injuries as bandaged up as they could manage while she rested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, I’m sure she’ll be following us soon enough!” Hilda called out from her own place in the procession, before she glanced up at Claude, clearly wondering if their mercenary friend really would be okay.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah I'm sure she'll be fine, if she doesn't get lost anyways. Who knows, maybe next time we see her, she'll be crossing the border from Almyra," Claude joked, trying to lighten the mood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She wouldn’t get that lost, right?" Raphael asked, looking back at the monastery. "Maybe we should leave a trail or something?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We don't really have any supplies to do that, big guy. That and if we leave a trail, we might be leading anyone who attacked the monastery towards us…" Leonie muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then we'll just kick their ass!” Balthus declared, “Besides Shez is probably fine. Hell, she's probably hanging out in Abyss right now." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“See? Keep optimistic, everybody,” Claude encouraged, grinning at his classmates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...um, but…shouldn’t we talk about how she seemed to be possessed?” Ignatz spoke up, frowning. “I mean, all of us could tell that she wasn’t acting like herself and there really did seem to be someone else in her body.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, yeah, that was weird,” Raphael agreed, “...do you think Shez has a secret evil twin?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No, Raph. I don’t think any of us think that,” Leonie replied, giving her friend a confused look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Then I don’t know what that was.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well…Shez always had weird powers. And Byleth said she was being controlled? And the…other Shez called Shez her partner, so…” Leonie sighed, scratching her head. “Honestly, that all happened really fast and I feel like most of us just kinda spoke without thinking." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In that case, we should figure out what to say to her when we see her again!" Claude suggested. "Such as, 'what the fuck was that about'?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It would be more prudent to watch our language and ask if she's okay," Manuela chimed in, giving her students an amused look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, but I feel like my suggestion is the better one to start things off. What do you guys think?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We should ask if she's hungry,” Raphael suggested, “I mean, we only had breakfast today!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh yeah that's true, we should get something to eat soon! Hey Lorenz, how far is your dad's place from here?" Balthus asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you're going to wait until we arrive at Gloucester Castle, then you'll have to pick up the pace if you want to eat today," Lorenz answered, getting the two to groan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know if you're inviting some food, I could just go on ahead and enjoy a nice meal myself." Claude said, winking as he patted his wyvern. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey Claude, have I ever said you were my best friend~?" Hilda asked with her own wink, only for Leonie to clap a hand on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If we're stuck on the ground, you are too." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aw, but I'm so sweaty…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's not that bad, Hilda. Besides, I'm sure we can probably find a river or something to wash off." Leonie said, getting the noble girl to groan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And if you guys are hungry, I could try hunting a bit. I'm no Petra, but I can probably find something." Ignatz offered, earning a grin from Leonie. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now you’re speaking my language, Ignatz!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, do recall that hunting in another nobles territory without their leave counts as poaching,” Lorenz pointed out, “We would not want to–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, we’re not poaching, we’re just…uh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Requisitioning supplies?” Claude suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That is not at all what we would be doing,” Lorenz countered, unimpressed by their logic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I dunno, with how hectic things are being, who's gonna notice a rabbit or two going missing?" Claude asked. "I'm sure Shez would agree with me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In that case, if we get in trouble, you'll shoulder all the blame?" Leonie asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Eh, maybe Shez agreeing with me means it's a bad idea." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the students laughed, Lorenz couldn't help but roll his eyes, far from amused, before glancing at Lysithea. "How are you doing?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Tired…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My apologies, I'll try to move as fast as we can without causing you discomfort. And once you get better we can make sure to get ready to give Shez a piece of our mind." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Lorenz heard her mumble something, though he couldn't make it out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What was that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nothing. Just talking about how stupid she is." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, blunt but not incorrect. I must say, I'm sure Shez appreciates having a good friend like you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I hope so. She saved me…” she murmured softly, fighting to stay awake. She had so much she owed Shez for, and she was going to make sure to pay her back. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>A heavy silence fell upon the Blue Lions. Even with all the chatter from the residents of Abyss, both old and new, the students from Faerghus were unsure of what to say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So…do we…talk about what Shez said?” Annette asked, glancing among her friends with a faintly concerned look, “Because that was…a lot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What do we even talk about?" Ingrid asked, letting out a sigh. "Are we even sure that it was Shez?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, I'm pretty sure that was the professor…before her hair turned green anyways," Sylvain said, rubbing the back of his head. "Still trying to wrap my head around the whole…goddess incarnate thing." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And what about the Heroes’ relics?" Annette asked, looking at the two lances Ingrid and Sylvain had. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, my apologies, but we're a bit out of the loop," Hanneman said, gesturing to himself, Yuri, and Ashe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, care to enlighten us, friends?" Yuri requested, “Particularly about that part about Byleth being the ‘goddess incarnate’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, well, that part…hm.” Mercedes fidgeted with her hands, trying to think of how to explain. After a moment, she nodded to herself. “Professor Byleth is the divine vessel of the Goddess who has returned to the world for vengeance against those who murdered her children and mutilated their bodies, twisting their bones into weapons and we are the descendants of the apostates that imbibed their blood. Ah, the blood of her murdered children, specifically.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...What?" Ashe asked, completely taken aback. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It also seems like Shez might be the vessel for the one who led those who murdered her children, and was seemingly threatening her last remaining child. All this to say that all of us are likely forsaken by the goddess," Mercedes elaborated, her hands clasped together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...This is certainly a lot to take in," Yuri commented, turning his gaze away from Mercedes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, the Alliance is likely forsaken as well, since many of them are descendants of the Elites as well." Yuri did his best to ignore what she was saying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know, this makes sense to me," Felix said, somehow saying that with a straight face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How??" Ingrid asked, looking at him wide eyed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The Crest weapons have always been unnerving and looked like bones. Clearly they must have been someone's bones." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The noble houses of the Empire are descendants of the Saints, who fought against Nemesis so they likely aren't forsaken as they did fight alongside the Immaculate One…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So I knew they kinda looked like bones, but saying this makes sense is a stretch, Felix," Sylvain said, brushing past Mercedes's muttering. "...Should we bury the weapons?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, Sylvain no. I know this…is really bad, but these relics are very important, even more so now since we're at war," Ingrid pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The apostles likely aren't forsaken either," Mercedes mumbled, giving Yuri a glance that made him take a step away from the blonde. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Still it, uh, kinda seems like we should do something with them?" Annette suggested. "Maybe we could ask Professor Byleth what to do with them?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That…would be most prudent if she is the goddess incarnate," Hanneman muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, we should find where Professor Byleth is, right?" Ashe asked, worried about his friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I got it," Mercedes chimed in, speaking up as she clapped her hands together, "The Kingdom and the Alliance are both heretical lands and we all need to repent to the goddess for any chance of mercy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Should we be worried about her?” Sylvain asked, gesturing at Mercedes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think we should all be very worried for our souls, yes,” the blonde replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Technically I think Shez is only haunted by the spirit that killed the goddess’s children," Dimitri said, finally speaking up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Why is </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>the first thing you've said, Boar??" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well…I've been thinking about what we heard, and I remember Shez told me she was haunted by a spirit that wanted to fight her sister." Dimitri shrugged, looking at Felix. “I feel like it’s the most reasonable explanation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What is wrong with you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“At the moment, less than usual, I think.” He sighed, scratching at his head. “I was…so absolutely filled with rage at encountering that knight who outright admitted to being one of the men that enacted the Tragedy, and yet now, I just feel…confused. I…I’m still upset, obviously, but…my own anger feels…smaller, almost, when compared to the rage of the goddess. The fact that she shares that same pain of her family being murdered…I feel…strange, yet also lighter, somehow?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could the House of Blaiddyd be viewed as the worst of the heretics for turning against the goddess’s chosen while declaring themselves holy?” Mercedes asked, looking directly at Dimitri.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Well…the Church declared us holy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your kingdom is false and godless, born of blood and treachery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Um…hey, Mercie?” Annette spoke up, looking worried for her friend, “Do you…want to maybe get a snack? It might help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I would like a cookie,” Mercedes murmured. Gently grabbing her friend, Annette helped Mercedes up, and walked her away to find something to eat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...so, we're going to need to keep an eye on Mercedes," Ingrid said after they left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right…we'll also need to ensure that everyone here is safe before we begin scouting out. There are several entrances to Abyss, so making sure that our enemy doesn't find and use any of them is our top priority," Dimitri decided, standing up, still feeling confused but…he had something to focus on at least. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I just realized, Dorothea is dating a goddess," Sylvain commented, completely throwing everyone off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Sylvain, forgive my language, but what the hell are you talking about?" Dedue asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You barely even cursed…” Felix muttered while Sylvain continued to explain his weird logic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, they were trying to keep it a secret, but it was obvious to me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Wait, what about Edelgard–No, I shouldn't ask. This doesn't involve me."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…does the goddess practice monogamy?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, we are moving on from this conversation because this definitely feels like blasphemy," Dimitri decided.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then let’s bring up something else,” Yuri spoke up, catching their attention, “Namely, what are we going to do going forward?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Dedue asked, frowning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean, what do we do here? The Church’s forces are scattered, right? So that means all of us are on our own. We might have each other, but we also have a lot of mouths to feed here, and a big question of where we go from here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re talking about who we should side with,” Dimitri noted, earning a grin from the former Wolf.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly. Now, I might not have as direct an experience with everything that went on, but I like to be informed and asked around. From what I know, your uncle has declared war against the Church and the Empire. He’s usurped your throne and got your country declared illegitimate…but I guarantee he’d prefer having you under his thumb than killing you outright. You siding with Rufus gives him legitimacy. And more than that, it could keep Faerghus united. The Church is broken right now, so if you join up with Rufus, </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span> the nobles there will likely be fine with flocking to your shared banner, and you have the Western Church to take over as </span>
  <em>
    <span>the</span>
  </em>
  <span> religious authority backing you up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In exchange for throwing away my honor to side with a man who willingly works with those behind the Tragedy of Duscur,” Dimitri countered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s true. It’s also true that he’s leveled an accusation against the Empire that I have to imagine plenty of people will see as legitimate. That’s more than enough to justify a war. And you have to ask yourself…do you think he’s lying about Duke Aegir and Lord Arundel orchestrating that massacre?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That is a truth I will have to look into myself,” he replied, ignoring the voices trying to push him in either direction. Killing Aegir, killing Rufus, declaring for the Kingdom, declaring for the Empire… “If I side with Edelgard, Faerghus is guaranteed to be considered illegitimate. I will be all but handing over the country to her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure that isn’t what you should do?” Yuri questioned, “You heard Mercedes there. If the goddess herself is upset with you guys…well, it takes away the ‘Holy’ part to your kingdom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could we trust Edelgard?” Ingrid spoke up, “If we did side with her, would she even let us keep our lands? Or would we see Faerghus split up for Adrestian nobles to take?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That earned a frown from Hanneman, though Yuri grinned. “An excellent question, Ingrid. Not only that, but if Adrestia does take Faerghus, what do we think it means for Leicester? We might see an ambitious Emperor decide all of Fodlan should be united. It doesn’t even have to be Edelgard. Any kid of hers would have that idea in mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Considering who she seems interested in, I don’t think Edelgard is having kids,” Sylvain pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She can adopt,” Yuri retorted, “And that’s assuming Edelgard herself wouldn’t want to unite Fodlan herself. We don’t exactly know her motives, now do we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We know she is in favor of a more equal society,” Hanneman remarked, crossing his arms over his chest, “One where crests are not upheld above the lives of people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s kind of a dangerous sentiment up in Faerghus,” Sylvain noted, “I don’t disagree with it, but it’s not going to sit right with most of the nobles there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should point out, we aren’t certain of what Rufus wants either,” Dedue commented, frowning in thought, “What we do know is that Rufus has taken the throne and is willing to side with a man who directly participated in the massacre that took Lambert’s life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Anaximandros,” Dimitri muttered, remembering the arrogant knight. “...what do you think would happen if we side with Leicester?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you trust Claude not to take advantage of Rhea’s declaration and take Faerghus for himself?” Yuri asked without pause, clearly having thought of it already, “If I remember my history right, House Riegan does have a loose claim to the throne of Faerghus. And if bowing to him can guarantee your nobles keep their seats…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What options do we have then?” Felix spoke up, audibly irritated, “All your doing is pointing out that every path in front of us is a terrible one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s because they are,” Yuri replied, “We’re in a bad position. Not an impossible one, but one that means we need to think about what we’re doing. Prince Dimitri here does have power, but only as far as who he allies with. Trying to go this alone isn’t tenable. We need supplies, we need weapons, and we need a way to make sure we aren’t just rolled over by the first person who decides they can get a better deal by grabbing up a bunch of noble heirs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, why can’t we just try to get support from the nobles that will oppose Rufus?” Ashe asked, “I can’t imagine everyone is okay with what he’s doing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because even if Rufus himself is an idiot, whoever’s supporting him isn’t. They’re going to know people won’t agree with their decisions, so what do you think their first, best move is?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Killing everyone who would stand against them,” Dimitri realized with dawning horror.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yuri held up a finger. “Not necessarily. They might just arrest the more valuable ones, probably under suspicion of being involved in the Tragedy. Noble hostages tend to keep people in line. Still, I wouldn’t recommend rushing to anyone’s rescue. We’re not exactly prepared for a fight like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Dimitri resisted the urge to ask ‘what do we do’. He was the prince. He should be making the decisions. “...There are houses that would remain loyal to me. Fraldarius, Ifan, Gautier, Galatea–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you have noble houses that are loyal to you. How quickly can we contact them without putting the people here in danger?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” He took a breath. “...Charon is the closest major house. We should make contact with them first, then with the houses we know are loyal. We can stockpile supplies, if possible, and we’ll want to see if we can convert some of the land here into farmland… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The prince sighed, feeling the weight of his responsibilities. “...We need to split up for now. Abyss can remain our primary refuge, but we cannot simply wait and avoid taking risks. One team needs to work quickly, a second needs to work carefully. Once we’re in a better position…then, perhaps, we can look into actual negotiations.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Leaving your options open then…not the worst decision,” Yuri remarked, seeming amused, “Just be aware, your highness, you’re going to have to get your hands pretty dirty if we’re taking this route.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was willing to soak my hands in blood for the sake of avenging my family. I am certainly willing to claw my way through the dirt for the sake of my people,” Dimitri stated, meeting the Wolf’s eyes directly, and earning what seemed to be a genuine smile from him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He ignored Felix’s scoff. His friend would come around. For now, he needed to focus on those here who needed his help. People who had lost their homes and those who never had any to begin with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Vengeance could wait. He needed to help.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Seething as he stalked through bloodied fields, Epimenides cursed those who turned against him. After everything he did for his people, he couldn't believe their leadership would so eagerly repay his efforts with betrayal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For now however, he had something he was looking for. He wasn't going to let those ingrates take his masterpiece. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arriving to where their last clash had taken place, he found his trophy. With a grin, he reached for the Sword of the Creator. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before he could grasp it however, he felt his vessel being wrestled from his control. Moments later, he was floating above his partner, who grabbed the sword and glared up at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why do you fight against me, partner?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Arval</span>
  </em>
  <span> is my partner. You're just a monster!" Shez said, aiming the sword at him. "A monster who took my sister from me!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She wasn't your sister. Just a vessel for an abomination–"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shut up! Will you just shut the fuck up!? I don't care what you have to say! Nothing you say or do will make me hate my sister!" Shez shouted, tears pricking her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...And nothing you do will get her back. She's gone forever." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez let out a breath, the sword shaking in her grip. For a moment, despair almost overwhelmed her before she forced it down through pure defiance. "I'll get her back. One day I will and we'll make you pay. Until then, I swear, if you try to take over me one more time, I'm going to make sure that there is nothing for you to possess." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You foolish child. You have no idea what that abomination took from our people–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“OF COURSE I DON’T!” Shez shouted, glaring at the spirit, “I didn’t grow up in your shitty city because my mom knew it was crap and took me away from there! She knew it was awful and </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> know she made the right choice! Every Agarthan I’ve met, with one </span>
  <em>
    <span>single</span>
  </em>
  <span> exception, has been a piece of </span>
  <em>
    <span>shit</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…you are an ignorant child,” Epimenides retorted, keeping his voice cold to bury his anger–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And whose fault is that, huh? You know, I felt bad about getting mad at Edelgard because I realized she had a reason to hide what she did. I forgave Kronya because while she might’ve had shitty reasons, she cared about me. What about you, huh? How long have you been lying to me? Hiding that you’re this…whatever the hell you are!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You could’ve told me. You could’ve told me–You could’ve just said you got your memory back, or…or whatever, something, I don’t know! I would’ve trusted you! A-And you could’ve told me about where I come from, and who my people are, and why you have this </span>
  <em>
    <span>stupid</span>
  </em>
  <span> grudge! And I would’ve listened! I might’ve thought you were wrong but I would’ve listened. And you didn’t give me a chance to because you do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> give a shit about me. You just wanted to use me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She brushed away tears with her sleeve, angry and upset, before glaring up at the wraith that should’ve died ages ago. “…you could’ve been part of our family. I…I would’ve been happy with that. But that wasn't good enough was it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Would you have sided with me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth is my family." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then there's your answer." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez tried not to cry as she slashed him, dispelling his form and leaving her alone. Taking in a deep breath, she turned around and looked at the ruined field before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn't know where to go, so she just started walking. Maybe she could find someone. Claude, Dimitri, even Edelgard–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you go to any of those filthy beasts, I will kill them,” Epimenides whispered in her ear, making her stiffen, “I have tolerated your foolishness for too long. If you will not accept your role, then I </span>
  <em>
    <span>will</span>
  </em>
  <span> ensure you live a life of nothing but suffering.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez let out a shaky breath. The sword was heavy in her grip, but still sharp as she laid it against her neck. “...try it, and I’ll kill both of us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her grip spasmed as Epimenides fought her, his anger burning up inside her head. “You stupid child! You will not cast me back into that darkness–!”</span>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <span>“Don’t worry, </span>
  <em>
    <span>partner</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Wherever we’re going…we’re going together,” she muttered, before letting the shadows pull at her. She had no idea where she was going, but one way or another…Epimenides wasn’t going to hurt anyone she cared about.</span>

  <p>Dolofonos of Agartha waited patiently, cleaning his blades of the blood staining them. He had to take good care of his image now that he was a sage. Or, well, a sage candidate. Technically he still had competition, but he was certain he could achieve great things on his current mission, thereby securing his status as a sage!</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. Were your masters really incapable of sending someone to aid me sooner?” the subject of his current mission complained as he walked out of the room he had been changing in. </p><p> </p><p>Ludwig von Aegir would say he had seen better days, but his treatment as a prisoner of the empire was actually fairly generous when one took into account the crimes he was responsible for. Not that he really appreciated the nuance; being stuck in a well-furnished cell and fed three times a day was about equivalent to being stuck in a filthy, rat-infested dungeon with nothing but rags for bedding in his mind.</p><p> </p><p>The irony was, of course, entirely lost on him.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, they were. The hegemon was occupying the palace, and her spymaster made infiltration difficult,” Dolofonos replied, his voice even and unconcerned despite the violence continuing throughout the palace. Not the loud, clanging of blades, but the sudden choked gasps of beasts finding their throats filled with steel. “Finding means by which we could get around his agents took a great deal of time and effort. We needed a perfect time at which the Emperor and her aides were absent, the security was low, and the staff was minimal. So, yes, this was the earliest time at which we could rescue you.”</p><p> </p><p>Ludwig hadn’t interrupted, in large part because the assassin hadn’t paused in cleaning off his bloodied blades at all in the time he was speaking, though he soon found his voice again. “Fine, I see your point. I would have preferred if it could be done sooner, but I suppose it is fine as long as I am free. Now then, let’s make for whatever escape route you have set up and head to my territory. We’ll need to prepare for Edelgard’s retaliation–”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not what’s happening,” Dolofonos contradicted, “We’re taking this palace.”</p><p> </p><p>“...What?”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re taking the palace. You’re going to use your authority as a duke to take control.”</p><p> </p><p>“...That…are you insane?! We don’t have the manpower to hold the palace, especially after Edelgard replaced everyone who would be loyal to–”</p><p> </p><p>“Just tell them to follow you instead.”</p><p> </p><p>Ludwig stared at Dolofonos, aghast. “I…that isn’t how anything works–”</p><p> </p><p>“Just do it.”</p><p> </p><p>And so, the palace of Enbarr was seized by Duke Ludwig von Aegir. For about five minutes.</p><p> </p><p>“What in the world are you doing on that throne?” Myson asked, genuinely confused by the sight of the balding noble looking very uncomfortable as he sat on the throne of Enbarr.</p><p> </p><p>“You tell me! Why am I supposed to hold the palace of Enbarr?!”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re what?” Myson looked over at Dolofonos, who looked very pleased with himself. “...Why did you decide to take the palace of Enbarr?”</p><p> </p><p>“It would be a boon for our forces, Lord Myson,” the assassin replied, nodding confidently to his superior, “To steal the hegemon’s seat of power will undermine her authority and erode confidence.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yes, those are all very good points, but we can’t keep it.”</p><p> </p><p>Dolofonos paused. “We can’t?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. Of course not. We don’t have nearly the resources in the Empire to maintain a hold on their capital. The plan was to go back to Aegir and use their forces to bolster our eastern holdings while using the Kingdom to take the west. Taking Enbar comes after we erode their power base and kill all of Edelgard’s supporters.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. I was…under the impression that we had bolstered our forces.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, we did. And then we lost a good portion of those forces taking the monastery. At this point, I’m just having Odesse ransack whatever we can get before abandoning the wretched place.” He paused. “Oh, also, Odesse died so I made Agnus the new Odesse.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I am sorry for your loss, my lord.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, it’s tragic. Still, at least we filled out the ranks of the sages.”</p><p> </p><p>Dolofonos blinked. “You did?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, we did. Kyrie?”</p><p> </p><p>A moment later, a female warlock warped in at Myson’s side, bowing her head respectfully. “Yes, my lord?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing, I just wanted to show off that we now have a sage of water. Oh, though you should take Aegir back to his territory so we can actually enact our plan to trap Edelgard in a two-pronged war.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, my lord.” She promptly walked over to Aegir. “Up.”</p><p> </p><p>“...what? Are you trying to treat me like a dog?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm.” Kyrie looked back at Myson.</p><p> </p><p>“Be polite about it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course.” She turned back to Aegir. “Please get up.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Ludwig’s eyes narrowed in suspicion, but he pushed himself up from the throne before frowning at Myson. “Is this truly the level of competence your people–”</p><p> </p><p>“Kyrie, if you would,” the Agarthan requested, and the newly made sage promptly put a hand on Aegir’s shoulder before vanishing with him, warping away to the intended extraction point. “Finally, I thought I would have to keep listening to that grating voice of his…”</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, Lord Myson," Dolofonos spoke up, getting the Warlock's attention.</p><p> </p><p>"Hm? What did you need?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not to be rude but…I thought I was going to be the Sage of Water." </p><p> </p><p>"Well yes, but with how things went, I figured it was best to have a sage be one who doesn't work in such clandestine operations such as yourself. Unless you would prefer working out in the open more." </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, no of course not. I was…simply not expecting you to give it to someone else." </p><p> </p><p>Myson raised an eyebrow. “Is there an issue I am unaware of?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, of course not, my lord.” He resisted the urge to start cleaning his blades again. They were already clean, he should be talking now. “...is this because I tried to take the palace?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not being punished. I simply felt that Kyrie’s efforts should be rewarded,” Myson replied, mildly annoyed. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, of course, my lord,” Dolofonos responded, trying to hide his disappointment.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you like to be a sage as well?” </p><p> </p><p>Immediately, the assassin perked back up. “Ah…if you would grant me such an honor, my lord. Though, ah, didn’t you state that the ranks had been filled?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine, you can be the…secret eighth sage, the Sage of Blood.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! I didn’t know there was a secret sage…”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, no one does. Congratulations.”</p><p> </p><p>Dolofonos beamed proudly. “Thank you, my lord! I shall wear this honor with pride!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure you will. Right, that completely threw off my train of thought…Odesse!”</p><p> </p><p>In an instant, Odesse appeared by Myson’s side. “Yes, my lord?”</p><p> </p><p>“Report on how the clean-up of Garreg Mach is going.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, not too well, my lord. Some pockets of resistance have cropped up that are giving us trouble. It seems the Fell Star’s appearance galvanized a number of Kingdom soldiers into turning against us and joining with the church forces. We have been able to loot some objects of interest, according to reports, but things have become more difficult than expected.” He paused. “Oh, and Chilon has died, my lord.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh really? Well that’s lucky–Ah, wait, no, now I have to find a new Sage of Earth…” Myson paused, then looked at Dolofonos. “Dolofonos, you’re the new Earth Sage.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Oh, ah…hm.”</p><p> </p><p>Myson raised an eyebrow. “Well? I thought you would be happy.”</p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh, yes, it is an honor, my lord, but…am I no longer the secret eighth sage then?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Myson sighed. “Odesse, make a note. Dolofonos is now the secret eighth sage of Agartha, the Sage of Blood.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I was not aware that there was a secret–” At Myson’s annoyed glance, Odesse immediately changed the subject. “Of course, my lord! And, ah…the Sage of Earth title?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, I’ll find someone for it later. For now…hm…” He glanced at the throne of Enbarr, before casually raising a hand and launching a Bohr at it, blowing the throne to pieces. “There, that’s better. Dolofonos, set some fires. We’re going now.”</p><p> </p><p>“At once, my lord!” Dolofonos saluted, before getting right back to work with a sense of joy at his new position.</p><p> </p><p>It just went to show, hard work always paid off.</p><hr /><p>One week after the events at Garreg Mach, Rufus Thierry Blaiddyd, the Grand Duke of Itha and Regent of Faerghus, held court at Castle Fhirdiad. Representatives from every major house were called to attend, and Margrave Matthias Raoul Gautier found himself in a truly chaotic throne room.</p><p> </p><p>Voices fought to be heard over the din as questions were raised by every count and courtier present. Word had spread quickly of an invasion of Garreg Mach, an attack directed at the Church of Seiros itself, something that galvanized the lords of the Holy Kingdom in a righteous anger against whatever fool would attack the heart of Fodlan. And then that anger was roughly undercut when the news spread that the army that struck at the church marched under the banner of Faerghus.</p><p> </p><p>So here they were, lords and representatives, waiting to hear from the regent that so severely overstepped his boundaries.</p><p> </p><p>Matthias spotted him first. The blond head of hair that looked so similar to Lambert’s was unmistakable, even if his locks were paler. </p><p> </p><p>Rufus never had the presence his brother did. Lambert could draw people in with his voice, convince men to follow him into a bloody battle with only a few words while Rufus followed in his shadow. The way they dressed conveyed it further, as the pale teal of Itha never matched up to the vivid blue of Blaiddyd.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, here was Rufus, wearing that vivid blue in the form of a surcoat, clasped with silver. A silver crown lined with sapphires encircled his brow, and a furred cape of blue and white trailed from his shoulders as he walked up to the throne and sat upon it, facing the crowd with an admittedly regal posture.</p><p> </p><p>And following him was another familiar face: Cornelia Arnim, the new bishop of the Western Church, wore a pleased smile as she followed her obvious patron. The former court mage wore a white gown that looked closer to what a proper holy woman should wear, though the blue and indigo lining, coupled with blue feathers lining her vestments and a silver girdle cinching her waist, nearly made Matthias scowled at the sheer ostentatious wealth she was putting on display.</p><p> </p><p>The sapphire necklace resting on her openly displayed chest didn’t help that impression at all. </p><p> </p><p>Then she spoke, in a voice that carried through the throne room. “Presenting his majesty, King Rufus Thierry Blaiddyd.”</p><p> </p><p>The hall went dead silent. Matthias felt his eyes go wide, the shock of that proclamation stealing his voice, before an immense anger built up inside of him.</p><p> </p><p>“How dare you!” he snapped, pushing his way to the front with a fierce scowl, “You have no right to that throne, Rufus! You are the regent, nothing more!”</p><p> </p><p>More voices spoke up, echoing the sentiment or just fighting to be heard, but Rufus seemed unbothered. He simply met Matthias’s eyes, and the head of House Gautier felt himself pause for just a moment.</p><p> </p><p>Had Rufus’s eyes always been that blue?</p><p> </p><p>“I see there are objections to Lady Cornelia’s declaration.” His voice was calmer than Matthias expected, his tone even. “That is fine. I didn’t expect it to be immediately accepted. What I do expect is for all of you to listen as I lay out the horrific, criminal conspiracy I have discovered was enacted against Faerghus. By that, of course, I refer to the Tragedy of Duscur.”</p><p> </p><p>More murmurs sprung up throughout the hall, though they quieted the instant the regent began his explanation. </p><p> </p><p>Matthias crossed his arms over his chest, listening with an irritated frown that slowly grew more horrified the longer he listened to the regent’s tale of a monstrous conspiracy enacted by the nobility of Adrestia. Not because of the contents of the regent’s speech, but because of the implications he was putting forward.</p><p> </p><p>“Years ago, Anselma von Arundel, a woman of noble birth from a minor Adrestian house, seduced the emperor of Adrestia and bore him a daughter. Years later, while her rival consorts and their children were butchered in Enbarr, she came to Faerghus, took the name Patricia, and married my brother. Your king.</p><p> </p><p>“She never grew close to my brother. She always kept her distance, though not out of guilt. No, she chose to avoid getting close to Lambert because she, a liar and a bigamist, intended to have him killed from the moment she met him. Thus she worked with traitors within the Kingdom, savages within Duscur, and murderers within the Empire to butcher my brother and all of his attending knights! </p><p> </p><p>There was a cold glint in Rufus’s eyes as his false fury subsided. ”And yet, how was it that my nephew survived? That he alone was spared? Was this mere fortune? No, not at all. Dimitri was spared as part of the plot. The plot that the chosen heir of Adrestia and the prince of Faerghus would be wed to steal our land out from under us!”</p><p> </p><p>The noises of outrage made Matthias scowl. The idiots around him were getting pulled in by their already present hatred of Adrestia and Duscur, willing to believe the worst of those they considered their enemies. “And what proof do you have for your claims?”</p><p> </p><p>He knew he made a mistake the instant Rufus smirked. “Thank you for asking, Margrave Gautier, for I do have proof of my claims.”</p><p> </p><p>And on cue, a number of individuals wearing the clothes of Western Church clergy entered, carrying boxes of books and documents, which they set down.</p><p> </p><p>“These are the records of the Western Church’s investigation as a neutral third party.” The fact that he could say that with a straight face while Cornelia smiled at him in approval made Matthias’s stomach turn. “Included are documents penned by Anselma von Arundel regarding her conspiracy and those she brought in under her sway. In addition, I have testimony from a witness.”</p><p> </p><p>Matthias stiffened as he saw Rodrigue marched out by a pair of those damnable ‘Tempest Knights’, so-called protectors that were little better than tax collectors for all the payment they demanded for their ‘protection’. </p><p> </p><p>“Duke Fraldarius, thank you for joining us,” Rufus said, smiling at the duke, “It is my understanding that you looked into the matter of ‘Patricia Blaiddyd’ and her involvement in the Tragedy of Duscur. Am I correct?”</p><p> </p><p>“...that is correct.” Rodrigue seemed pained as he spoke. Reluctant, maybe, though Matthias found himself looking for hints of bruising.</p><p> </p><p>“And you had your suspicions of her involvement, didn’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I did.”</p><p> </p><p>“And what did you find?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” He took a breath. “I discovered that her carriage was undamaged and empty.”</p><p> </p><p>The gasps that rang out had to be planned. Matthias couldn’t believe anyone was being taken in by this farce.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you for your testimony, Duke Fraldarius. We will be discussing your own failures to properly protect the crown from undue influence soon, but before that, I think it best to assuage any issues my people may have.” He stood from the throne. “For I can understand your concerns, my people! I myself harbored concerns! Is my nephew merely a victim in this conspiracy? Is the princess Edelgard a mere pawn of a greater evil? I sought answers! That is why those who support me chose to speak with the archbishop, to bring back our noble children and ensure the threat of the Empire is ended! And what did we find instead?! A declaration that <em> we </em> are false, that <em> we </em> are nothing! That our sovereignty is rendered <em> worthless </em> by the mere word of a corrupt institution!</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think I did not feel trepidation? Do you think I did not worry, making these hard choices? Of course I did! And so I turned to the goddess herself, to pray for her guidance! And she showed me the truth, that the archbishop has turned away from her light! That she is no servant of the goddess, but a heretic of the highest order! And if you ask for proof, then I shall gladly give proof of her favor!”</p><p> </p><p>He extended a hand, and Matthias went rigid when he saw a crest of Blaiddyd glowing above the usurper’s palm, bathing the room in a blue light. A <em> major </em> crest of Blaiddyd.</p><p> </p><p>“...goddess above…” It was impossible to tell who spoke. The shock that spread through the room at the impossible sight stunned all present.</p><p> </p><p>“Hail!” Then a sudden shout cut through it. Viscount Mateus stepped forward, kneeling to Rufus. “Hail Rufus, King of Faerghus!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hail Rufus, King of Faerghus!” echoed another viscount, Gideon.</p><p> </p><p>“Hail Rufus, King of Faerghus!” came a third, Elidure, and that brought more voices to the fore, echoing the sentiment as the usurper found his legitimacy in just one gesture.</p><p> </p><p>It was madness. An impossibility that sat poorly in Gautier’s gut. The idea of the crestless gaining a crest…it opened up too much. If Rufus could give crests, if he had that power, then any noble would flock to his side. They didn’t even have to be faithful; the cynical among them would gladly give over loyalty for the sake of gaining a powerful crest.</p><p> </p><p>And his own position just became a great deal more tenuous. The house of Gautier held its power because they could wield the Lance of Ruin. Yet if Rufus could hand their ancestral crest over to a sycophant…</p><p> </p><p>Maybe he should just escape, bring Rodrigue with him. The duke looked like he was about to be sick, the implications clearly sinking in for him as well. And if he believed Rufus could give a crest, then why wouldn’t the rest of these nobles believe it?</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps he was being paranoid. Perhaps he was merely making assumptions…but then Rufus glanced at him. And the usurper smirked.</p><p> </p><p>…he had to get out of Fhirdiad. </p><hr /><p>“We can’t just do nothing!” Catherine shouted, glaring angrily into the calm face of the Eastern Church’s bishop. The knight probably would have looked more intimidating, were it not for the fact that she was still in a white infirmary gown. </p><p> </p><p>“I am not asking you to do nothing, Lady Catherine. I am asking you to wait and <em> recover </em> until we have a better understanding of the situation,” the Eastern Bishop stated, frowning up at the taller knight.</p><p> </p><p>“I <em> understand </em> that the monastery was attacked! That means I need to be out there, protecting–”</p><p> </p><p>“You are not going anywhere with that injury of yours.”</p><p> </p><p>“Watch me!”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, now hold Catherine, I think Lady Juliet has a point,” Alois interrupted, glancing between the two ladies, “Believe me, I’m as worried about everyone as you are, and I know for a fact you’re certainly not spineless.”</p><p> </p><p>Catherine blinked. “What? What would…Why would you bring up the idea of being ‘spineless’ right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m saying I know you have a spine, Catherine, because I saw it when your back was cleaved open. Seriously, I would believe the bishop when she says you should rest, that was downright gruesome.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s–How can you be so calm about this?! The monastery might have been burned to the ground and everyone there put the sword!” Catherine snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“I know that’s possible, but it’s not <em> guaranteed </em>,” Alois emphasized, “We don’t know anything yet. I know Captain Jeralt was there, and I trust him with my life. If anyone can keep the monastery safe, he can. And until Shamir gets back to tell us what she found out, we’re going to keep calm and you’re going to rest–”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been resting! How the hell am I not better already!?” she questioned, glaring at the bishop, who met her gaze with a calm frown.</p><p> </p><p>“Because whatever weapon you were wounded with resists healing magic. It doesn’t completely negate it, which is the only reason you’re still alive, but not only did you take a blow that would have killed most people were you not both incredibly hardy and incredibly <em> lucky </em>, you were feverish with a severe infection for weeks. The fact that you’re standing now is impressive, but I guarantee it will be even longer before you’re ready to fight again.” The bishop sighed, shaking her head. “I understand your fears. I share them. But we cannot allow ourselves to give into fear, or we’ll lose before we can act.”</p><p> </p><p>Catherine scowled, but Alois nodded along to the bishop’s words. “Yes, exactly! We cannot allow ourselves to give into fear, no matter what! There is nothing to be afeared of!” He paused. “Hold on, that one might be an actual word…”</p><p> </p><p>“You have been off your game lately,” Shamir noted as she entered the infirmary, “Half of your puns are just bad wordplay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Only half?” Catherine asked, her frown fading to a slight smile when she spotted her friend.</p><p> </p><p>“Shamir!” Alois was more exuberant in his greeting, a wide smile coming to his mustachioed face. “You look well! What news do you have of the outside world?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing good, unfortunately. No one knows where Rhea is and from the rumblings going around, Rufus declared himself king and appointed Cornelia Arnim as the new archbishop.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?! He can’t do that!” Catherine snarled, openly furious, but Shamir just gave her a resigned sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Unfortunately, most of Faerghus wouldn’t agree with you. Duke Fraldarius was already arrested, supposedly for his failures in protecting Lambert, and the lesser nobles are gladly signing on with him for some reason. Some people are saying he has the blessing of the goddess, but nobody in Alliance territory believes that, so we shouldn’t have to worry about zealots coming this way. At least not without resistance.”</p><p> </p><p>“And what of Captain Jeralt?” Alois asked, obviously worried.</p><p> </p><p>“From what I’ve heard, he’s in the Empire. Odds are, his kids are with him, though I don’t know for sure.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, good. Byleth and Shez wouldn’t leave their father alone in this difficult time, so I’m sure they’re with him.” Alois settled back, looking relieved, though Shamir grimaced.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be too happy. The Empire is having its own trouble, from the sound of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“We can discuss that later. What about Garreg Mach?” Catherine questioned, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“Destroyed.” She chose to ignore Alois’s flinch as she continued her report. “Supposedly the invaders let loose a lot of meteor spells at once and then had demonic beasts set loose to smash everything that wasn’t burning. A lot of the knights are missing too, though apparently so is a good portion of the Kingdom’s army. The ones that survived, at least. Nobody is really sure what happened there, but it sounds like those mages that were in Ordelia joined up with Rufus’s forces.”</p><p> </p><p>“The dastards that created those monstrous knights?” Alois furrowed his brow. “That…How in the world could a group of mages that needed the support of Lord Acheron of all people be such a massive threat?”</p><p> </p><p>“I doubt they were working for Acheron. Odds are, it was the other way around.”</p><p> </p><p>“So what does that make them then? Adrestians? Foreigners?” Catherine asked, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…oh! What if they’re from Morfis?” Alois suggested, “That land is said to be one of skilled mages, isn’t it? So perhaps they sailed across the seas to trouble us!”</p><p> </p><p>“We should probably look into more likely results before making big assumptions,” Shamir noted, “All we really know is that they’re mages, they don’t like us, and their leader knows how to make monsters.”</p><p> </p><p>“And claims he knows how to resurrect the dead,” Catherine commented, remembering part of Shamir’s previous report.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Claims, </em>” Alois emphasized, looking pretty disturbed by the suggestion.</p><p> </p><p>"Regardless of what they can or can't do, it's obvious that they're dangerous. Even if they lost a sizable amount of kingdom forces in the battle, they're bolstering it with their weaponry and odd magic,” Shamir noted, “As it stands, our best bet would be to wait for things to settle and talk with the Alliance houses to get some aid." </p><p> </p><p>Catherine frowned. "And how long is that going to take?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well, the Alliance is known to take a long time to come into agreement about anything, but surely they must understand how important it is to act immediately!" Alois said.</p><p> </p><p>"...So what's our second best bet?" Catherine asked, looking away from him.</p><p> </p><p>"Going to one of the other nations and trying to get allies there. The kingdom is closer, but it's also the most dangerous as we don't know whose siding with who. The Empire on the other hand is having trouble with Aegir, who’s apparently leading a rebellion against the Emperor. I don't know who sided with him, but if we try to go into Adrestia we'd have to go through Hrym territory, which he controls,” Shamir explained, “And that’s not mentioning how we’d have to deal with whatever forces Acheron has blocking the major bridges.”</p><p> </p><p>“So what, we’re stuck?”</p><p> </p><p>“We could go with the original option,” Alois commented, “Yes, the Alliance might take time to act, but this is a crisis–”</p><p> </p><p>Catherine scoffed. “Yeah, sure. Look, Alois, I’m pretty sure we’d have better luck getting help from Almyra than getting the Alliance to act in a timely fashion.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t recommend that. We might move slowly here, but you’d be lucky if the Almyran court just laughed you out of their halls.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that, it wasn’t a real suggest–” Catherine blinked, then looked over at the unexpected new voice standing by the door to the infirmary. “Claude?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey there,” the young noble greeted, grinning at the trio of knights that were staring at him in visible surprise, “I heard this is where I should go if I wanted to know what the Knights of Seiros were up to and I have to say, I didn’t think this was all I would find.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, well, we do have more members present, but most of them are either recovering or assisting the Eastern Church–”</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell are you doing here?” Catherine asked, talking over Alois, “And when did you get here? Because this is some suspicious timing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I got here before Shamir did,” Claude replied, amused, “I just hung out until you three met up again, since I figured it would be better to talk to you all at once.”</p><p> </p><p>“So what do you want from us?” Shamir asked, regarding the former student with a small frown, “We don’t exactly have much to offer.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes you do,” Claude countered, “The three of you have something very important to offer me here: information.”</p><p> </p><p>“What, do you want us to spill the secrets of the church?” Catherine asked, unamused.</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re willing, sure,” he replied, shrugging, before he gave them a more serious look, “Here’s the thing: I don’t know what’s going on right now. All of Fodlan is in chaos and nobody seems to really know who’s responsible or why. And I can imagine you all understand why that’s a problem, right? There’s some kind of organization working in the shadows here, people who can somehow start conflicts all across Fodlan through a mix of subtle manipulations and brazen acts of defiance and violence that keep catching everyone off guard. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what their deal is, but I know they hate the church with a burning passion and Rhea was angry enough with them to decide the Kingdom should be dissolved just for working with them.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hang on, what!?” Catherine exclaimed, her eyes wide.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it’s a whole thing that happened, and I’m not surprised you didn’t know, considering where you are right now. But you do know some things,” Claude noted, his gaze intent, “We’re all out of the loop right now, but not completely. I’m on one side of it, you’re all on the other. So what I’m suggesting right now is that we pool that information. I tell you what I know, you tell me what you know, simple as that.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Catherine shared a look with Shamir, a frown on her face. The archer met her gaze, then shrugged, not really minding the idea. As far as she was concerned, it was like strategizing with a new client. “Hm…what do you know about what happened to Lady Rhea?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not much, unfortunately. I know no one took credit for capturing or rescuing her, and she disappeared pretty early into the invasion. I didn’t see her die though, so I have a feeling she’s still kicking.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…that’s not very reassuring…but thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, if I may,” Alois spoke up, looking concerned, “I…well, I don’t doubt that Jeralt would have evacuated everyone from the town and saved as many civilians as he could, but…do you know what happened to the townspeople?”</p><p> </p><p>“I do, and your family’s safe, Alois.” The knight visibly relaxed, almost sinking as the tension left his body. “The civilians were evacuated to Abyss or the cathedral before the fighting really got going. I don't know the specifics on where they all ended up, but most of the ones at the Cathedral ended up going to the Empire from what I've heard." </p><p> </p><p>“Then they could be in Abyss, or with Jeralt? Well, I suppose I know where I need to look first then!”</p><p> </p><p>“And while you find your family, I can talk with our friends here,” Claude said, grinning at Catherine and Shamir, the former of whom let out a huff.</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t call us friends, kid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yet. You wouldn’t call us friends, <em> yet </em>.” Claude smirked at the pair of knights. “I’m sure we can fix that though. I’ve been told I’m pretty charming.”</p><hr /><p>Seteth woke up with a pounding headache inside a cave. He hadn’t done that for well over a thousand years by this point, so he was understandably confused for a moment. He even had a brief moment of wondering if the past years had simply been a dream and he never truly left the canyons of Zanado before everything coalesced in his mind and he remembered the fire and pain that had preceded his unconsciousness.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Hey, Seteth’s awake.” He blinked at the voice that spoke up, then looked over to spot a familiar boy.</p><p> </p><p>“Cyril? What is…what are you doing here?”</p><p> </p><p>The Almyran boy looked at him, a small frown on his face. “I brought you here. You were knocked out by one of those meteors exploding and I made sure you didn’t hit the ground." </p><p> </p><p>"I…Well, thank you, Cyril, but I meant what are we doing in Zanados." </p><p> </p><p>The young boy shrugged. "He said to go here," Cyril explained, pointing to the side, getting Seteth to look over at a cloaked figure standing nearby. </p><p> </p><p>“Hello Seteth. It is good to–”</p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t you the gardener?” he interrupted, genuinely confused as he stared at the cloaked man with a familiar voice.</p><p> </p><p>“...I’m a gardener, yes. Not the head gardener, actually, though I suppose since he was killed in the meteor strikes–Ah, I suppose that arguably makes me the head gardener now, if just because everyone else either died or evacuated…though the greenhouse is undoubtedly destroyed too, so–”</p><p> </p><p>“My condolences for your loss, but that doesn’t explain anything,” Seteth interrupted, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh there’s no need to apologize, he was racist so it’s not really a loss–”</p><p> </p><p>“Could you please focus, Mister…?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Oh, Gajus. And right, yes, I should explain things. Starting with something that should hopefully explain things,” he said, before he reached into the top of his robe and pulled out a necklace made of a silver chain attached to a fragmented stone…</p><p> </p><p>Seteth’s eyes widened. “...is that a crest stone?”</p><p> </p><p>“It was once part of one, yes." He placed the chain back under the robe. "Cyril, I hope you don't mind fetching some water for Seteth here." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, okay,” the young boy agreed, nodding before he left. </p><p> </p><p>"...Do you mind explaining to me why you have a fragment of a crest stone <em> on a necklace?" </em> Seteth asked, trying not to shout. </p><p> </p><p>"Lady Rhea gifted this to me long ago, when I became one of her cardinals," Gajus replied, his hand still holding onto the fragment under his robe. "It was a sign of her trust in me, and other cardinals who received a stone." </p><p> </p><p>"...What?" </p><p> </p><p>"Forgive me for not coming to you sooner Saint Cichol, but Lady Rhea thought it prudent to keep the identity of her Cardinals secret unless otherwise necessary," Gajus explained, before kneeling to Seteth, "However, with her missing, we felt it necessary to reveal ourselves to you once you had awoken. Without the archbishop we have no leader, and we see no other better suited to the position than you." </p><p> </p><p>“...” Seteth had a thousand thoughts running through his head. He knew the cardinals existed, but the idea that they would want him as archbishop…and more than that, “What happened to Rhea?”</p><p> </p><p>“We do not know, unfortunately. The Immaculate One unleashed her power upon the invaders, but she vanished amidst the chaos. And, well…” He frowned, looking a little conflicted.</p><p> </p><p>“...what is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well…there are claims that the goddess returned.”</p><p> </p><p>Seteth’s eyes went wide, before he fixed the Cardinal with as serious a look as he could muster. “Tell me exactly what happened.”</p><p> </p><p>And so, the cardinal explained as much as he knew, as unbelievable as it all sounded. </p><p> </p><p>“...So, to summarize, a good portion of the remaining Knights of Seiros, along with a number of the Knights of Faerghus who defected to our side, now believe <em> Byleth Eisner </em> is the goddess, her sister Shez is some type of dark god counterpart to her, and they’ve returned to the heavens together.”</p><p> </p><p>“That does seem to be the doctrine they are establishing, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“I see.” Seteth considered that information. He processed it. Then he decided to focus on something else because that was insane. “And Flayn is fine?”</p><p> </p><p>“We believe so, yes. From what we know, she retreated with the Black Eagle class to the Imperial capital and she is likely residing in the palace of Enbarr at the moment.” Gajus stated. "From my understanding Enbarr is experiencing a refugee problem, and a civil war in the Empire thanks to the former Duke Aegir, but the violence has yet to reach Enbarr." </p><p> </p><p>"I see…" Seteth let out a sigh, pinching the brow of his nose. "I'll need to gain my bearings first before I can decide anything." </p><p> </p><p>“Of course. Please, make yourself ready and then follow me, if you would.”</p><p> </p><p>It did take a moment for Seteth to ‘ready himself’, as it were. He dressed easily enough, in simpler linen clothes than he had gotten used to wearing, though he made a note to find a comb as soon as he could. He looked downright shaggy at the moment…</p><p> </p><p>Zanado looked livelier than it had been in ages. The once barren canyon was teaming with soldiers in white and gray. Some were still wearing the blues of the Kingdom, though it seemed they had painted over the sigils of Faerghus in favor of Seiros’s symbol. </p><p> </p><p>“Is there a reason why you chose to go to Zanado?”</p><p> </p><p>“A mix of reasons, really,” Gajus admitted, “It is a better place to hide than the monastery’s ruins, particularly given the beasts the apostates and heretics unleashed. In addition, a number of the, ah…’enlightened’ seem to view staying in a sacred place as a way to get closer to the ‘reawakened goddess’. Being here seems to bring a measure of peace to their tormented souls. Many of them were consumed by guilt before we gave them work to do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…I suppose I can see why–Is that a golem?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm?” Gajus glanced over at Seteth’s surprised question, then nodded. “Ah, yes, it is. Unfortunately, it was too late to have them assist with the battle, but Iris and Bernhard made sure to bring as many as we could get along to help assist here. They contribute a great deal to our defenses, and some of our labor efforts.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Should you really be using golem for–”</p><p> </p><p>“Most of the staff is gone, your holiness. We take what we can get.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right,” Seteth allowed, feeling strangely chastened, before pausing as Cyril returned.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you’re up. Here, water.” And he promptly handed Seteth the pitcher he’d brought.</p><p> </p><p>“...thank you, I suppose,” Seteth replied, deciding to just hold the pitcher for the moment as he looked to Gajus, “I can’t say I expected any of this when I woke up, but…if you require my assistance in leading these people, then I’ll do my best to be worthy of your trust.”</p><p> </p><p>The cardinal smiled. “Thank you, Archbishop Seteth.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Why’s he the archbishop?” It seemed Cyril wasn’t happy with that decision.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s just a temporary arrangement until we can find Lady Rhea,” Seteth assured, nodding to the young boy.</p><p> </p><p>“...hmph. I’m going to hold you to that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course.” Seteth turned his gaze towards the canyon again, taking in the knights, the clergy, the golems, and thinking of a time long ago when Zanado had teamed with life just like this. When humans and Nabateans had lived together, openly.</p><p> </p><p>He wondered what Flayn would think of this sight. What his brothers might think. What Rhea would think. Then he sighed and shook his head, focusing on the here and now instead of what might be, someday.</p><p> </p><p>There was work to do.</p>

  <p>“...It’s okay,” Byleth said, giving her sister a reassuring smile, “Stay safe–" </p><p> </p><p>Before she could finish, the darkness consumed her. Pitch-black surrounded her on all sides before the void enveloping her stretched out into the distance, until the only thing she could see was the stone beneath her and a strange sky above. </p><p> </p><p>"...Stay safe, Shez. I love you," Byleth continued, finishing her words. Though before she could let what happened sink in, a roar made her jolt. </p><p> </p><p>Unleashing a swathe of flames into darkness above them, the Immaculate One roared, as if trying to reach the heavens. She roared and raged, beams of light illuminating the dark, before her body began to shift. Slowly growing smaller, Rhea turned her fury towards Byleth. </p><p> </p><p>"YOU IMPUDENT CHILD! Why would you stop me from attacking them!?!” </p><p> </p><p>"...She's my sister," Byleth retorted, trying to ignore the pain in her side as she stood up straight. </p><p> </p><p>"She's an <em> Agarthan! </em> You saw how she was! All of it, her false friendliness, was nothing but a trick!”</p><p> </p><p>"No,” she immediately denied, “That wasn't Shez. She was under control of someone else. She was fighting back." </p><p> </p><p>"And look where her 'fighting back’ got us," Rhea growled, her glare boring a hole into Byleth. "I should have executed her when I discovered her true nature." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth’s eyes widened, and before she could stop herself, her fist crashed against the archbishop’s cheek. </p><p> </p><p>"..." The disbelief in Rhea’s face lasted a moment, before it was replaced with divine fury. "You…To think, you would not only be a failure, but you would also dare to strike me…No matter. I'll just have to try again once I manage to escape from here." </p><p> </p><p>Stiffening, Byleth took a step back, before trying to call upon the divine pulse. Though, as she did, her head throbbed, almost making her double over in pain. Before she could figure out what happened, she felt Rhea tackle her, the archbishop’s hand becoming claw-like. </p><p> </p><p>"W-Wait!" </p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry mother, I'll succeed next time," Rhea stated, before plunging her hand down.</p><p> </p><p>"And how many times have you attempted this already?" a divine voice questioned, her hand lightly holding Rhea’s wrist, yet keeping the Immaculate One's hand in place. </p><p> </p><p>"W-What?" </p><p> </p><p>"I raised you better than this, Immaculate One. Take your weight off of me.” There was no kindness in the goddess’s voice. No hint of warmth or affection, merely cold authority as the progenitor god glared into Rhea’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>And like a chastened child, the Immaculate One hastened to obey. She stood, nearly stumbled, but righted herself, trying to keep steady despite the swell of joy in her chest. “M-Mother? C-Could I have truly–”</p><p> </p><p>“Be silent.” Her tone brooked no argument nor disobedience. The goddess stood, shorter than Rhea yet feeling enormous to the younger dragon. And while Rhea herself had lived for millennia…in the moment, she felt like a child, faced with the eternity her mother embodied. “Sit.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea stiffened. “What? Mother, I–”</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>“Sit.”</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Rhea sat, her legs folded beneath her under her mother’s glare.</p><p> </p><p>“How many times, Immaculate One?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Rhea didn’t try to pretend. She knew what question her mother was asking. “...counting your current vessel…it would be thirteen times, mother.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. And Sitri was the twelfth then? You sacrificed twelve lives in vain attempts to break the single taboo I laid down upon our people and resurrect me.”</p><p> </p><p>“It was not in vain,” she replied, trying not to argue yet unable to hide the complicated emotions going through her at the moment. To have her mother back…it should be a happy occasion, but–No, everything would be fine. “I succeeded. You are here.”</p><p> </p><p>“That is all you care about. You destroyed twelve lives you brought into the world, and you care nothing for them.” Sothis’s voice was cold to the point of sending a genuine shiver of Rhea’s spine. “Byleth called you grandmother. An honor you did not deserve.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” This wasn’t how it was supposed to happen. Her mother’s return should have been a joyous occasion. The goddess should have brought light back to Fodlan. But there was nothing but cold darkness in this empty void, and there was no hint of affection in her mother’s gaze. “...I did…I-I did love them, mother, I just–”</p><p> </p><p>“You wanted your mother back. You brought children into the world to die for my sake. I was not present. I cannot comment on your treatment of your crafted children. I <em> can </em> look at how you treated Byleth. Because as she said, I was awake the entire time. I saw how you choose to send children out to fight and kill on your behalf. I saw how you ran your church, how you treated those in your power, and how you reacted to those you thought were your foes. I have seen your charity and your cruelty, Archbishop Rhea of the Church of Seiros, founded in your name to enact your will.”</p><p> </p><p>Her hands raised and cupped Rhea’s cheeks, holding her with a gentle tenderness that made whatever protest the archbishop could conceive die in her throat. The goddess’s eyes gleamed in the darkness, a light ever present even in the depths of the void. </p><p> </p><p>“I have seen your work, my child,” she intoned, her divine word reverberating in the darkness. “And it makes me puke.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea had a brief moment for her mother’s words to register before Sothis reared back and slammed her forehead straight into the archbishop’s with a loud <em> THWACK. </em></p><p> </p><p>“AUGH!” Rhea exclaimed, grabbing at her throbbing head as she blinked tears from her eyes. “Ow ow ow–OW?! Why would you do that?!”</p><p> </p><p>“BECAUSE YOU’RE A DAMNED IDIOT!” Sothis snapped, dropping the heavenly goddess act in an instant as she glared down at her daughter. “AND I’M AN IDIOT FOR NOT DOING THAT SOONER!”</p><p> </p><p>“H-Huh? W-Wait, Mother–”</p><p> </p><p>“NO! DO NOT GIVE ME THAT WHINY ‘AWWWW, MOTHEEEER’ CRAP! Do you even realize how insane it is to hear my own child founded a religion based around me?! I went to sleep for what I thought would barely be a nap and woke up to find out the majority of my children are dead, and the sole remaining one apparently started a continent-wide cult! What kind of nonsense is that?!” the goddess ranted, half-enraged and half-baffled, “And you, you just–Gah, there’s too much I want to say and yet–No, no, damn it, I am The Beginning, I can just make more time if I need to!”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea blinked through her teary eyes, confusion reigning supreme over her mixed emotions. “U-Um…Mother? What are you saying–”</p><p> </p><p>“Did I say you could talk?”</p><p> </p><p>She stiffened, immediately shutting her mouth in the face of maternal disapproval. Which she had to admit, she wasn’t sure how to deal with. <em> Mother never got angry at me… </em></p><p> </p><p>"Now then, shall we talk about how your mistake is the one that got us into this situation?" Sothis asked, finally calming herself down, "Because I believe that if a certain someone had just given up on trying to revive me using the baby of one of her 'children' then Jeralt would never have taken her away and you would have had a loving family with you here all along. </p><p> </p><p>"Or perhaps if you had just accepted Byleth as her own person, you wouldn't have scared her when she tried to show a bit of honesty about me being awake. You could have shown her a modicum of the same honesty when she asked you the truth of what you were planning. If you did she might not have ran away from you, while still trying to keep people in the monastery safe." </p><p> </p><p>Rhea remained silent, whatever she was about to say wilting as Sothis glared at her. </p><p> </p><p>"Did you even try to get to know Byleth, or was it all just a pretext for my 'resurrection'? How fixated were you on the idea of me, that you failed to see the bright young girl who would openly cry when visiting her mother's grave, who went into a panic when her sister was kidnapped, who is stumbling her way through a relationship so poorly she asks her lover if she can recommend poetry books to seduce her–” She paused, her lips quirking upwards in a moment of amusement. “And who apparently gets quite embarrassed when I point out her moments of emotion.”</p><p> </p><p>Sothis sighed fondly, shaking her head. “We really should talk about our recent streak of arrogance as well. Yes, I said ‘our’, because I was foolish to assume that because our thoughts aligned, they must be correct. It is easy to allow divine power to make one complacent, as evidenced by my own demise and our current situation. In many ways…Shez was correct.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wh–Mother, what are you saying–” Rhea began to protest, only to flinch when Sothis leveled another glare at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Did I say Epimenides? I said <em> Shez </em>, did I not? Honestly, it’s like you don’t even listen!” she complained, before shaking her head, “As I was saying, Shez wanted us away from the battle and, as foolish as it might seem to leave your students and family to fight on their own, her plan of simply evacuating everyone was better than what we came up with. So you will need to apologize when we escape. Yes, I know you were planning on doing so, yet you must do so even more. On hands and knees at the very least.</p><p> </p><p>Her joking smile faded. "We must also prepare for my departure." </p><p> </p><p>Rhea stiffened. "W-Wait, Mother, what are you saying?" </p><p> </p><p>"I said what I said. You broke the one taboo I had, and it is not one that I wish to continue. I don't plan on leaving just yet, as I can't trust you with Byleth, but it's only a matter of time," Sothis explained, sighing as she placed a hand on Rhea’s shoulder. "If there is one thing I must apologize for, it is coddling you far too much. Perhaps it was because you were my youngest, but I kept you far too close, and didn't let you spread your wings to have a life of your own." </p><p> </p><p>"...No, mother, I was happy. Being with you was all I ever needed, you have nothing to apologize for," Rhea said, tears starting to spill from her eyes, "Please, don't leave me." </p><p> </p><p>"My sweet foolish child, I already have. Even now, I wouldn't call myself the Sothis you once knew. So, please, cherish what you have, and not what you lost." </p><p> </p><p>“I-I can’t, I…It was all for you, everything I made, it was just–”</p><p> </p><p>“You made a resting place for our people and a sanctuary for the survivors. It pains me to hear you could not open your heart further to allow those who would love you to be by your side…but I do not think you a monster, Immaculate One. Foolish, yes. Blinded by grief and fear, certainly. But I will not spend what little time we have left lambasting you for past failures. You already know what fault I find in your actions.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed a kiss to Rhea’s forehead, gentle and tender, before she straightened, standing to her full height once more. "I'll be watching over you two, so please, ensure that I can pass with no regrets." </p><p> </p><p>Sothis buckled for a moment, as if about to fall over, before catching herself. Rhea wondered what her mother was going to say, until Byleth suddenly grabbed her forehead. </p><p> </p><p>"OWWW! Why is your forehead so strong??" the former mercenary asked, tears pricking her eyes as she crouched down, trying to soothe the ache in her head. </p><p> </p><p>"A-Ah?" </p><p> </p><p>"I know I hurt myself a bit punching you, but I didn't expect for your forehead to hurt that much. Are all dragons like this?" Byleth asked as she healed her forehead, "You know what, I don't care. Rhea, I'm quitting." </p><p> </p><p>"Wha–" </p><p> </p><p>"I know it's probably just because I'm irritated because of how much my head hurts, but I'm feeling really emotional right now, so I'm going to need you to shut up," Byleth ordered while continuing to rub her forehead. "I'm not going to apologize because you just tried to rip my heart out. And for that matter, you're also not invited to the wedding." </p><p> </p><p>"...You're getting married?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes. Well, I assume so. I didn't actually propose before getting trapped here, but I'm planning on doing so when we escape." She took a breath and stood back up, before rubbing the pained tears from her eyes. “Hah…right, how do I…uh…”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth trailed off, a look of concern coming to her face. “Uh…Sothis? I can’t, um…”</p><p> </p><p>A divine light returned to the young woman’s eyes, before her brow furrowed. “...hm. Hm. It appears I may have made a mistake.”</p><p> </p><p>“...er…mother?” Rhea spoke up, a little worried, “What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Never in her life did she ever expect her mother to look so awkward and embarrassed. “...Well, this is not an insurmountable problem. Presumably.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mother, what happened?” she insisted, her concern growing.</p><p> </p><p>“To be clear, the decisions that I made were perfectly sensible–She threw away the Sword of the Creator,” Byleth answered, interrupting Sothis, before the goddess abruptly gasped in offense, “How dare you! Don’t put the blame on me, you ungrateful brat! I tossed away my own bones so you could hug your sister! Yes, that was very nice, and I really appreciate it, but we really should just say it. Just because we should doesn't mean we should be so blunt!" </p><p> </p><p>Rhea couldn't help but stare in confusion at the conversation happening before her. "You…threw away the Sword of the Creator?" </p><p> </p><p>Sothis whirled towards her, scowling. "Only temporarily! I didn't expect for Epimenides to somehow lock us in a place that exists outside of time…I bet they didn't even make this void. They probably just found it, like how I gave them everything," the progenitor god groused, pouting.</p><p> </p><p>“...I do not understand, mother. Why is this an issue?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because I needed a focus through which I could channel my power. Or, more accurately, Byleth could, since my intent is to pass my powers to her as my successor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wh–You can’t–!”</p><p> </p><p>“I can, and I am going to. The issue is…well, I don’t imagine you happen to be carrying a fragment of my original body around with you?”</p><p> </p><p>"...Why would I?" </p><p> </p><p>"Right…hm. That is…troubling." </p><p> </p><p>“And…why is it troubling?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because that means we’re stuck here.”</p><p> </p><p>“...oh.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, ‘oh’.”</p><p> </p><p>The pair, technically three, of them lapsed into silence. Then Sothis decided to sit down.</p><p> </p><p>“...ah, mother?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have anything to actually say to me, or are you wondering what I am doing?”</p><p> </p><p>“...the latter.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am thinking.”</p><p> </p><p>“I see…Is there anything–”</p><p> </p><p>“Rhea, we are trapped in an endless void of darkness and, apparently, rocks. If you are truly desperate to be useful, look around to see if there is actually anything of use here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yes, of course!” She promptly stood and began walking, carefully exploring their surrounding area.</p><p> </p><p>“...don’t go too far!” Sothis called out after a moment, frowning. A moment later, Byleth spoke up, the glow in her eyes fading. “You’re worried about her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I’m worried about her, we’ve already established she’s not exactly sensible under pressure.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm. I don’t think I like her at this point.”</p><p> </p><p>“That is understandable. Your decisions are your own, do not allow me to influence you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. We’ll think of some way out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course we will. If there’s a way in, there’s a way out. We’ll find a way.</p><hr /><p>"..." </p><p> </p><p>"..." </p><p> </p><p>"..." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth had no idea how long the three of them had sat in silence after Rhea’s return, but it felt like an eternity. The fact that she hadn't slept just yet, however, meant it was probably just a few hours. Maybe. Unless the void worked differently than the regular world.</p><p> </p><p>"So…you have a lover?" Rhea eventually asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah. Yes…well, technically two? Um, Edelgard and I never made it official, especially since we need to talk with Dorothea, but…" Byleth shrugged, feeling very awkward. She hadn’t really expected this line of questioning, so…yeah.</p><p> </p><p>"I see…is that influencing why you wish to work for her?" </p><p> </p><p>"What? No. Well, maybe? I…I wanted to work for her, before I realized I liked her like this." </p><p> </p><p>"And what exactly made you want to work with her?" </p><p> </p><p>"Edelgard…we talked about what she wants for Fodlan, to make it a better place for everyone, not just nobles. There's still so much I don't know about this nation, so seeing her be so strong despite everything that happened to her…it was inspiring." Byleth let out a small laugh. "She even imprisoned one of the men who led the insurrection instead of having him be executed on the spot. Meanwhile, I really wanted to kill Catherine for what happened in Gaspard, so I evaded her until Edelgard pushed me to confront her. She’s good at that, pushing people into doing what they think they can’t do." </p><p> </p><p>"And Dorothea?" </p><p> </p><p>"I…She was one of the first friends I made here. Things might have gotten off to a rough start, but we worked past the misunderstanding. Her dream might not be as grand as Edelgard’s, but she's still going for it with the same determination. Even if she is willing to drop it to help a friend." Byleth scratched her head a bit sheepishly. "She told me recently that she actually canceled some dates so she could keep checking up on me after I got injured against the Death Knight."</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. And that attracts your interest?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Well, yes. Is that strange?” </p><p> </p><p>"No, I am simply curious. There's…much I don't know about you, because I haven't tried to get to know you," Rhea admitted with a sigh, "Speaking of, what exactly is it that Edelgard wishes to do for Fodlan?" </p><p> </p><p>"Um…" Byleth glanced at the archbishop, before scooting back a bit. "Promise you won't get mad?" </p><p> </p><p>“...No.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I’m not going to tell you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You cannot ask me to keep my temper when you know what you plan to say will enrage me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Which means I won’t tell you,” Byleth reiterated, “I’ll only tell you if you promise not to get angry. And if you lie, Sothis is going to know.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Very well, I promise not to get mad," Rhea said, after taking a deep breath. </p><p> </p><p>"Well…She didn't tell me everything, but I believe she wants to make a land that doesn't rely on the crest system, where anyone, be they noble or common born, is rewarded and punished by merit and not by their blood." Byleth took in a deep breath. "She knew she would face opposition, especially from the church given how they're the ones that help push it. To that end…she became the Flame Emperor." </p><p> </p><p>“She…Then that–So that is why–” Rhea’s gaze hardened, a fierce scowl coming to her face. “And she turned you against–Gah!”</p><p> </p><p>And she promptly reeled back when her mother flicked her forehead. “No. Bad Immaculate. Do not break your promises.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nhhh…” Rhea rubbed her forehead, still frowning. “I am allowed to be angry when–”</p><p> </p><p>“You promised you wouldn’t get angry from what Byleth told you, so no, you are absolutely not allowed to get angry in this situation,” Sothis retorted, unimpressed. “Have you always been so dishonest?" </p><p> </p><p>"She just said Edelgard is working with the people who murdered our kind!" </p><p> </p><p>"There were extenuating circumstances." </p><p> </p><p>"What kind of circumstances could those be?!" </p><p> </p><p>"They, um…murdered Edelgard’s siblings," Byleth said, cutting in and making Rhea pause. </p><p> </p><p>"What?" </p><p> </p><p>"The insurrection. It gave them access to Edelgard and her family. They experimented on her and several others, until she was the only one still alive. Presumably to make her into a weapon against you," Byleth explained, a frown on her face as she looked down at the floor. "It wasn't just her family, there were other experiments. Countless people probably died. All to give Edelgard the Crest of Flames."</p><p> </p><p>“...oh…no, that can’t be right. I would have…” She paused, a memory coming to her mind. Of the Agarthan, Myson, and his taunt towards Edelgard. His mention of ‘dungeons’. “...why wouldn’t she tell me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would she?” Byleth asked, before Sothis sighed.</p><p> </p><p>“To her, you are the one responsible for the world that would allow such a crime, my child. Would you have told the Elites the truth of Nemesis’s massacre in hopes they would join you?” the goddess questioned.</p><p> </p><p>Rhea had no answer for that. "...It seems I have much to think about." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, you do," Byleth said, getting Rhea to pause again. The Archbishop felt like this wasn't going to be an easy time here…Then Byleth stood up, clapping her hands together. “Alright, empty your pockets.”</p><p> </p><p>“...excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Empty your pockets. If we’re going to be stuck here, we should take stock of what we have and what we can maybe use to help us. Like if you have some sort of magic sword in your robes that could work as a substitute for the Sword of the Creator.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I do not. I was going to retrieve my sword, but then the meteors hit and I had to become the Immaculate One to survive.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you don’t have a sword then.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea frowned at the lack of sympathy. “No. I do not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. What do you have?”</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing, really. My robes do not have anywhere to hold items." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh. That sucks," Byleth remarked, frowning. "Hm…you should sew pockets onto your gowns. They're handy." </p><p> </p><p>"If you say so. I've never really needed to hold onto something directly on my person." </p><p> </p><p>"Because your sycophants would get everything or hold it for you?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I would not call them sycophants–"</p><p> </p><p>"Rhea, I'm pretty sure Catherine would cut down an entire village of people just because you told her to." </p><p> </p><p>“...I wouldn’t tell her to do that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You sure? What about if the village denounced you for some reason? Like the villagers that were following Lonato.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will defend myself if attacked, but I will not raze a village of innocents.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, but what defines an ‘innocent’ in your–”</p><p> </p><p>“Actually, thinking about it, I might still have a sachet of calming herbs somewhere on me,” Rhea muttered, starting to check herself while very obviously changing the subject.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, nice, that sounds handy. Hm, can they work as a tea or should I just bite down on them?" </p><p> </p><p>"I believe it's safer to not ingest them directly, especially given their strong taste. I've heard of those who use them as incense, while others add them to their meals."</p><p> </p><p>“Neat. Hm…well, it shouldn’t be too hard to start a fire,” Byleth noted, “And we could probably carve out a rock to use as a bowl or something…Ah, more importantly than that, we need to prioritize. The major necessities you should always have are food, water, and shelter. Everything else can come afterward.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth looked around the void, frowning thoughtfully. “Hm…this place seems pretty empty, so we probably won’t be able to find food. Water is more important though, since thirst kills faster than hunger. We might not need immediate shelter, since this place seems empty, but that’s not a guarantee…”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. I don’t suppose you brought any items to help with our survival?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I did, I always carry extra stuff with me,” Byleth replied while taking off her coat, before beginning to root around in its pockets. Moments later, she laid out everything she had on her: two healing concoctions, a key, some bandages, a small pack of jerky, and a whistle. "Okay, so we both get a concoction to ration as a drink, and we can split the jerky equally." </p><p> </p><p>“You can keep the jerky.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth frowned. “Rhea, you can’t starve yourself just because you don’t like the food that’s available–”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not starving myself, child. I am a Nabatean.”</p><p> </p><p>“...so you don’t need to eat?”</p><p> </p><p>“In a sense.”</p><p> </p><p>“What sense is that? Everything needs to eat.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea sighed. “To put things simply, child, I can survive without eating for a great deal of time. In fact, simply resting will allow me to survive without issue because we heal in our sleep.”</p><p> </p><p>“She could also eat rocks,” Sothis pointed out as she floated by Byleth, making the professor blink.</p><p> </p><p>“You can eat rocks?”</p><p> </p><p>“...hm. I…yes. I presume Mother told you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I did,” Sothis answered through Byleth, giving her daughter an annoyed look, “Don’t be pretentious, Immaculate. It’s not embarrassing to share how you plan to survive however long it takes to get out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do rocks have nutritional value?” Byleth abruptly asked, earning a huff from Sothis.</p><p> </p><p>“Not especially, but some of the minerals in them can be useful and they’re generally good for digestion. Try to find salty ones, if you can.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why? Are those better for her?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, they just taste better.” Sothis paused. “Hm. You might be able to eat rocks now too, Byleth.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I don’t know if I want to test that. That feels like something Shez would do.”</p><p> </p><p>"And you do remember me saying she was correct, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth frowned, before looking around and spotting a loose rock nearby. Reaching over, she grabbed it, and held it close. </p><p> </p><p>"Um…child, what are you doing?" </p><p> </p><p>With a deep breath, Byleth lifted the rock up and bit down on it. </p><p> </p><p>A sharp crack could be heard within the void followed by a scream of pain. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm. So you can’t do that yet,” Sothis noted, “...I’m sure your next set of teeth will be stronger–”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth could not punch ghosts. She could try though.</p><hr /><p>“Okay, we’ll save trying to eat rocks for later,” Byleth decided, ignoring the faint sting she could still feel in her teeth. Healing magic was helpful, but it didn’t take all the pain away. “Water is the more important thing to figure out anyway, which brings me to my first thought. Namely, can either of us use ice magic?”</p><p> </p><p>"...I am not especially skilled at ice magic,” Rhea admitted, “In terms of Reason Magic, my expertise lies more with fire.</p><p> </p><p>"Damn. Well, I can't really blame you, I'm not that good at it either. I've tried to have Shez teach me, but, well…we both have different ways of learning," Byleth decided to say, before sitting down, bringing a hand up as she focused. "Okay, just focus on the cold, make it solid…" </p><p> </p><p>After a moment, a sigil appeared before Byleth as she attempted to cast Blizzard, before a few cubes of ice flew out, clattering on the floor a few feet away. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s actually a lot better than usual,” she noted, a little impressed with herself.</p><p> </p><p>“You haven’t been able to do that before?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, not really. The most I’ve ever managed is mist. And even then, I think it was more like smoke.”</p><p> </p><p>“That is because your soul is naturally attuned to fire,” Sothis noted, “Fire, light, and thunder are what you’re best with, so elements that contrast them are harder to grasp.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. So why can I do ice now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, you’re talking to mother,” Rhea noticed, deciding to keep quiet while Sothis huffed.</p><p> </p><p>“Obviously because my power is aiding yours. After all, I am the progenitor, the source of all magic and the power that gives it strength.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Is that why magic circles look the same?”</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed it is! Their power is derived from my own!” Sothis declared, looking quite proud of herself.</p><p> </p><p>“So why does dark magic look different?”</p><p> </p><p>And that got her pride to drop into annoyance. “...because it is derived from a different source and structure. One that is most definitely worse than what my children created, hmph.”</p><p> </p><p>“...okay. So, uh…can you help with making water then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I can! Move over,” she demanded, and Byleth ‘moved over’ so Sothis could take hold of her body again, “Hm, now then…it has been some time since I’ve done this, but it shouldn’t be beyond my means at all to create a source of water for you both. In fact, I could probably create an entire lake! And a forest! And even animals to hunt!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Rhea wasn’t sure why, but she had a strangely familiar feeling of dread welling up inside of her. It was oddly nostalgic…</p><p> </p><p>What she didn't expect was for a loud bang and smoke to come from her mother’s outstretched hands, as if a well of magic suddenly exploded rather than bursting forth. Waving her hand as she coughed, Rhea did her best to clear the smoke. </p><p> </p><p>"Mother? Young one? What happened?" </p><p> </p><p>As the smoke dissipated, Rhea found Byleth sitting on the ground, her face covered in soot, before she let out a cough. "...so I guess water is a no go." </p><p> </p><p>“Er…are you okay?” Rhea paused. “Is mother okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…” Byleth sat up, trying to think for a moment. She could still feel Sothis’s presence, but… “I think she knocked herself out.”</p><p> </p><p>“That…hm.”</p><p> </p><p>“...well this doesn’t solve our water problem,” Byleth noted, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>Rhea sighed, before pausing as a thought occurred. “Hm. All we really need is ice to then melt into water, correct?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? If we have ice, I can just use fire magic to melt it. Why–Oh, you’re walking away.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth watched for a moment, initially feeling confused, before it turned to a faint annoyance when she was pushed back by the sudden appearance of a bulky dragon in her personal space. Then with a simple opening of her jaws, the Immaculate One breathed a blue flame that bathed the surrounding rock in a cold ice.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. So you <em> do </em> know ice magic.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea huffed at Byleth’s comment. “This is not the same as the magic humans use. Hoarfrost is a magic utilized by dragons, more powerful than any cold humans can harness.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Well, that’s interesting and possibly good to know for future reference…” Byleth pushed herself up, looking curiously at the mound of ice that had been formed amid the stone. “Hm…okay, we can reuse the concoction bottles for water, and if we dig a big enough ditch, we could probably have a bath or two…could you make a few more of these? I’m going to start digging.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea raised an eyeridge at Byleth, then very easily pressed a claw into the rock beneath them and simply tore through it, forming a very large hole quite quickly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s useful. Okay, keep doing that, please. If possible. make sure it's smooth so we don't have to deal with sharp edges while bathing," Byleth requested, and she had a feeling that Rhea rolled her eyes at her before the dragon continued expanding the hole, making sure it was deep enough to hold a sufficient body of water. </p><p> </p><p>"There, that should be good," Rhea said, turning back into her human form after digging two ditches, "One to bathe in and one to drink from." </p><p> </p><p>"Good work Rhea," Byleth said, smiling at the archbishop, before working on melting the ice into the holes. The archbishop watched for a moment, then moved over and lit her own hand aflame to begin melting another ice mound until they had two proper pools of water.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Are you sure we should be getting comfortable here?” she asked, glancing at Byleth, “We should focus our efforts on escaping as soon as possible.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a bad way to think about it. We aren’t making it harder to escape by making sure we’re going to be comfortable while we’re here,” Byleth replied, “Sothis might be able to figure something out, or we could discover a way out if we travel far enough. We don’t know for sure yet, but it doesn’t hurt us at all to set up a camp so we’ll have somewhere to return to.”</p><p> </p><p>“...hmph. Very well. Let me know if my mother awakens. I am going to look around again,” Rhea decided, moving away from the pool and shifting into the Immaculate One again as she flew off into the void.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Byleth watched her leave, then glanced over at Sothis, who was floating beside her again with a small frown. “Should I mention you’re awake right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“...no, let her fly for the moment. She always enjoyed clearing her head in the sky," Sothis answered, watching the white dragon grow small in the distance. "It's almost comedic. It took her breaking the one taboo for me to realize my mistakes." </p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean?" </p><p> </p><p>"I coddled her too much, I didn't let her fly as free as she should have. The monastery might have been a self imposed cage she built for protection, but that was only because Zanado was a cage of its own. One she's never been able to leave." </p><p> </p><p>“Hm. It sounds like she was happy though.”</p><p> </p><p>“Does it matter if I give my child a happy childhood when she is never happy in her adulthood? She never moved past my death, and I…I can understand it. She was the youngest and she lost everyone she ever loved. I just wish she had managed to find something new and not lost herself in her own grief.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know if she could have. Some people, when they lose those they care about, don’t ever get over it.”</p><p> </p><p>“…I wish things had been better for her. I dislike the choices she made, but I don’t want her to be miserable.” She glanced at Byleth. “And I can’t stay with you forever.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused. “You can’t?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. I will be with you, always, because you bear my heart. My existence is not one that can be summed up in simple terms like ‘living’ or ‘dead’, so I will always linger in some form. Yet, as I said to that fool of man that possessed your sister, I should not be haunting this world as I do. My time has passed, and I should pass on as well.” Sothis looked into Byleth’s eyes, a small smile on the spirit’s face. “Do not weep overmuch for my passing, though I do expect at least some mourning and wailing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm. I’ll make sure to forget about you immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah–You little brat! I gift you with divine power and this is how you repay me!?” the goddess fumed, before her scowl broke into another smile as she pretended to be angry, “Well now you need to do something special for me! Compose a poem–No, a song! A song in my honor!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll get right on that.” Byleth stared at her long-time companion, then brushed at her eye, trying to clear a faint sting there. “Mm…so, what does this involve? Am I going to turn into a dragon?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course not–...well, actually, hm…ah, the thing here is that I shall become one with you, and you will gain…well, I’m not entirely sure. I don’t think you’ll get the power of creation, not unless you live to be over a thousand…”</p><p> </p><p>“...is that something I can do?”</p><p> </p><p>“Possibly, though don’t assume anything. I’m not sure how this might change you, but…well, you can never be sure how life changes you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please don’t turn the possible physical changes I might go through into a proverb.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop taking everything I say so seriously then!”</p><p> </p><p>“I refuse.” She crossed her arms over her chest, trying to remain firm…before she let her arms fall at her sides. “...should I call Rhea back here?”</p><p> </p><p>“That would probably be best, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I don’t want to say goodbye to you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will still be with you. I promise you that.”</p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth reached up, her hand passing through Sothis. "...I wish I could at least hug you." </p><p> </p><p>“...damn it, don’t make me cry. I’m the one who’s supposed to be keeping things together,” the goddess grumbled.</p><p> </p><p>The two chatted for a bit longer, just enjoying the feeling of being in one another’s company, before Byleth turned her gaze towards the sky overhead as Rhea flew back towards them. She took a slow breath, then let herself step back, in a sense, relinquishing control of her body to Sothis as the goddess smiled sadly at her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t have any luck this time either. This place might be genuinely endless…” Rhea trailed off, noticing the glow in Byleth’s eyes, and shifted back to her human form as she frowned at her mother. “...what is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s time, Immaculate One.”</p><p> </p><p>“...no. N-No, please, it can’t–I just got you back–” Rhea stiffened, her protest choked off when Sothis gave her a hug, wrapping her arms tightly around her child.</p><p> </p><p>“Mm…I cannot believe you had the audacity to grow taller than me,” she murmured, feeling how stiff and tense Rhea was. “It is okay. I am sorry I wasn’t there when you needed me.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Rhea swallowed her sorrow, trying to fight back tears. “They took you in your sleep. I never even had the chance to say goodbye to you." </p><p> </p><p>“I know. I am sorry.” She sighed, softly, then moved back and reached up, taking her daughter’s face in her hands and meeting her eyes. “Immaculate One, for all I disapprove of your actions, I know you spent a very, very long time alone. I wish you could have moved on from me, but I am not unhappy to be here, with you and with Byleth. You may have caused pain…but you also brought this child into the world.</p><p> </p><p>Sothis smiled with genuine warmth despite the sadness in her eyes. “My heart is her heart now. My life is hers, but her life is not mine. Let her be her own person, and I swear, you will be happier for it.”</p><p> </p><p>Tears spilled down Rhea’s cheeks, her composure cracking completely as she crumpled to her knees, only held up by her mother’s gentle grasp. “I-I…I thought…I thought everything would be better…”</p><p> </p><p>“I know you did. You tried your best. I could never hate you for that.” Sothis pressed a kiss to Rhea’s forehead. “I love you, my child. Be safe. Be happy. Find those that will fill your heart with love and wonder and I swear to you, this pain will fade.”</p><p> </p><p>“It hasn’t. It’s been so long and it still hasn’t…”</p><p> </p><p>“I promise, it will.” She rested her forehead against Rhea’s, then began to hum a song the Immaculate One knew by heart. A lullaby, sung to her as she drifted to sleep millennia ago…</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in a long time, the tension left her body, and Rhea began to relax.</p><p> </p><p>"<em> In time's flow," </em> The two began to sing together in their native tongue, " <em> See the glow of flames burning bright," </em> A light began to envelope Sothis as Rhea’s grip tightened, " <em> On the swift river's drift," </em> Sothis’s voice began to fade, " <em> Broken memories alight…" </em>Singing alone, Rhea wept, holding onto the young girl who cried in return. </p><p> </p><p>United by the loss of a loved one, the two held onto one another, letting their tears fall unabated. </p><hr /><p>Byleth blinked awake, slowly and with a faint frown. She wasn’t sure how long she’d been sleeping, given the eternally dark sky overhead, but after Sothis…passed, she’d been sleeping a lot more. </p><p> </p><p>Part of that might have been a form of depression or mourning, but she was pretty sure it was mostly just emotional exhaustion. Or maybe a side effect from fusing with Sothis. Which was still something she was adjusting to.</p><p> </p><p>“...” She debated going back to sleep. She’d done that a few times, woken up just to sleep again, but she felt like moving now. Curiously, she wasn’t even that stiff, despite sleeping on stone with her coat as a pillow. “Hm…maybe I should take a bath…”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea wasn’t around at the moment, so she’d presumably have privacy. She couldn’t really say she was bothered by the idea of her being around though. Rhea was…she was family, even if things were complicated and messy, and she’d had baths with Shez before. So with that line of logic figured out, she made her way to the bathing pool and began to undress, starting with taking off her eyepatch because it was feeling annoyingly tight for some reason.</p><p> </p><p>Then she blinked. With two eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“...what.”</p><p> </p><p>Moving to the pool of water, she stared at herself, and saw two eyes stare back at her. There was still some scarring but her eye was back. In a rush she began to remove the rest of her clothes, trying to see if the rest of her scars had healed as well. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn't sure whether she should be relieved or not to see the scars on her body, both old and new, including the one the Death Knight had left on her chest. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Okay, that’s…good? Good. Yes, having an eye back is good, I have two eyes again. Oh this feels weird now…” She blinked at her reflection, then paused and brushed her hair back, trying to see if her ears were pointed now.</p><p> </p><p>She twitched slightly upon feeling the tips of her now pointed ears. Taking in a breath, she tried to calm herself down, letting go of her ears before splashing water on her face. This…was a lot to take in at once, and she decided to instead focus on relaxing. </p><p> </p><p>Stepping into the water, she formed a basic fire spell to warm it up, getting it just right for her to relax. Letting out a sigh, Byleth laid back in the water, staring up into the void…or was she staring down? </p><p> </p><p>She didn't really have any idea if up was still up in the void. It would have been okay if there was…any form of landmark here to help focus on, but there really wasn't anything. A part of her wished she had brought a book, but she probably would have read it ten times over by this point. </p><p> </p><p>"...I need a new hobby," she muttered to herself, before glancing around. Gardening and fishing weren't really options here, so she had to make do with what she had. Not that she had much, aside from rocks, all she had was what she had brought with her. </p><p> </p><p>It was a shame they ran out of calming herbs already, those helped a bit after Sothis left. </p><p> </p><p>Regardless, there had to be something to do…hm. Reaching for her clothes, Byleth grabbed her dagger, along with a stray rock nearby. It was a decent sized one, bigger than her hand, so it would make good practice… </p><p> </p><p>With a nod, she began to carve a face into it, starting with the imperious looking eyes–</p><p> </p><p>"Byleth, are you awake?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not doing anything!" Byleth shouted, sinking her hands into the waters to hide the rock. </p><p> </p><p>“...” Rhea, who had decided to discard her archbishop raiments a while ago in favor of just wearing her white gown, stared in obvious confusion at Byleth, before her cheeks turned a little pink and she averted her gaze. “Right, ah…I apologize, I did not realize you were…of course, it is perfectly normal for a woman your age to want some…stress relief, and, ah…I will leave you to that.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked, before abruptly realizing what Rhea thought was going on and immediately going completely red. “Th-That’s not–...m-mmh…”</p><p> </p><p>Sinking into the water, she hoped that the surprise of her eye returning would be enough to get Rhea to forget about this misunderstanding.</p><hr /><p>“To begin, Nabatean biology is quite different from human biology,” Rhea began, attempting to act dignified and calm after Byleth asked her to explain her body’s changes. In return, Byleth chose to ignore how the archbishop had literally squealed with excitement when she first explained her changes. “As you already know, our people may resemble humans, but we have a number of significant differences that make us entirely distinct from them.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, we can eat rocks,” Byleth agreed, nodding.</p><p> </p><p>“...that…there are other differences, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right. What do rocks taste like anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think there are other things we can focus on–” Rhea paused as Byleth put a pebble into her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“...hm. I don’t know why, but my first thought is ‘tastes like chicken’.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, everyone says that. The rocks at Zanado tasted more like pheasant though. There’s a subtle difference,” Rhea replied, her exasperation fading as she discussed the topic, “Honestly, the stones here taste more of duck to me than poultry. More…fatty, somehow.”</p><p> </p><p>“Duck is a type of poultry.”</p><p> </p><p>She paused. “What? No it isn’t. Poultry doesn’t refer to all birds.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but duck is a type of poultry. Chickens, ducks, and geese are all types of poultry. I think it counts as long as it’s domesticated and nobles will domesticate anything if they think it’s pretty.”</p><p> </p><p>“...well, yes, that is true, but you wouldn’t call a falcon <em> poultry </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm…I think I would. A bird is a bird.” Byleth tilted her head, thinking. “Have you ever eaten a falcon?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I believe we should discuss something else now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have. It wasn’t that good. Sort of gamey.”</p><p> </p><p>"Why did you eat a falcon?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well I was hunting for food, and it's the only thing I saw,” she explained, “When you're traveling, you kinda eat whatever you can get your hands on if you're low on supplies." </p><p> </p><p>"I thought your family were all famous mercenaries? Surely you must have had food more often." </p><p> </p><p>"More than other mercenary groups, sure, but that didn't mean we didn't have dry spells. Heck, the entire reason I met Shez is because we didn't have any jobs for a few months so we needed to go hunting." Byleth shrugged. "It's why I always try to save up on money. Though I ended up blowing all my savings while I was here." </p><p> </p><p>Rhea winced. “Ah, yes, I recall you saying so…you were supposed to get raises–”</p><p> </p><p>“I know. I didn’t. So, yeah.” She paused. “Is it weird that I’m more mad about that than you trying to kill me?”</p><p> </p><p>“...the offer for a million gold is still open.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth raised an eyebrow. “Where am I going to spend it? In the infinite darkness?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Don’t sass me.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not my boss anymore so you can’t give me orders,” she bluntly stated.</p><p> </p><p>"...Your resignation hasn't been officially filed." </p><p> </p><p>“You can’t pay me, so that isn’t valid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes it is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I’ll just leave anyway. I’m a traveling mercenary, and as Jeralt says, if a job is terrible, just leave.” She paused. “To be clear, I really enjoyed teaching. I don’t enjoy working for you. You’re a bad employer and I will be informing other mercenary groups of such.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea frowned, before moving over to her discarded raiments and picking up her headdress. “Would this suffice for payment?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’ll do for severance pay,” Byleth stated, taking the gold headdress without hesitation. She looked at it for a moment, before putting it on. "Does this mean I'm the Archbishop now?" </p><p> </p><p>“...No.”</p><p> </p><p>“Would I be if I took the rest of your clothes?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. The clothes don’t make the archbishop.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm.” Byleth obviously didn’t believe her.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you even want to be the archbishop?" </p><p> </p><p>"Probably not, but it would make it easier to dissolve the church so things are easier for Edelgard." </p><p> </p><p>Rhea sighed. “Can we get back to the changes you’ve gone through? Such as how much you’ve been sleeping, for instance.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked. “That’s a Nabatean thing?”</p><p> </p><p>“It is! It is perfectly normal for Nabateans to sleep for long periods of time due to illness or injury so our bodies can regenerate, as you can clearly see.” Byleth raised an eyebrow, but Rhea didn’t seem to notice her own wordplay. “I remember some members of my kind would sleep for an entire week because they were stressed." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…hm. But I could get so much done in a week…" Byleth murmured, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, I can understand your apprehension. Flayn is also not fond of sleeping for long periods of time after…a rather extended period of recovery." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…so as long as I make sure to stay healthy and unstressed, I should be okay?" Byleth asked before thinking. "...Might be a good idea to stock up on calming herbs when we get out of here."</p><p> </p><p>“They do tend to help, yes. Though I will note that you should probably take some on your own to get more used to it.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused. “...why? Did I say something weird?”</p><p> </p><p>“A few things, yes. You were quite emphatic about wanting to cuddle with your girlfriends, you declared your intent to pull ‘Shez’s ghost’ out of her body and then beat him to death, and you suggested crests were the root of all evil and the solution to the world’s woes was to make everyone into dragons.”</p><p> </p><p>“...all I remember is being hungry and eating the rest of the jerky.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, that will happen sometimes. You get used to it. Admittedly some of the fault lies on me for giving you the calming herbs I use for myself. I tend to require a stronger version." </p><p> </p><p>“...huh.” Byleth slowly nodded. “We were having a biology lesson.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, right, where was I…well, do you have any questions?”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess so. I do want to know if this is something that, ah…well, if I can ever go back to being human. I’m not…I’m definitely not unhappy to have my eye back. It just feels strange and I want to know if I can fix it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea blinked. “Fix it? Child, this…isn’t something you fix, it’s part of who you are.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s…I only became like this because I fused with Sothis. I’m not…like this naturally.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that. I know you were mostly human previously, but now you are a Nabatean in truth. That is reality.” She tried to smile. “You could look at it as a natural progression, if you want. In a sense, it is your heritage awakening. Though Sitri was a homunculus, you are still partially Nabatean, and now you are Nabatean in full. Isn’t that natural?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Nothing about me is natural,” Byleth muttered, feeling a strange surge of sadness, “My heart doesn’t beat.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mine doesn’t either, child. Our hearts are stones. They do not beat like human hearts." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth looked up at Rhea and saw nothing but honesty in the older woman’s gaze. She stared for a moment, then took in a deep breath, trying to absorb that information. That she wasn't alone in how her heart worked was…certainly something she didn't expect. "...What about Shez? Or Edelgard and Dorothea? All of my other friends and students…they're just human. Am I supposed to outlive them now?" </p><p> </p><p>"You can offer them your blood, see if they wish to extend their life. But…I cannot guarantee they'll accept." Rhea managed to smile then, but it was a sad one. “It is the reality of being who we are. It is inevitable you will outlive at least some of those you care for. But then, that is true for many, isn’t it? Living means you will inevitably outlive someone you love.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hm.” Byleth laid down and stared up into the darkness. She could see with both her eyes now, though there wasn’t anything to see. “...that’s scary.”</p><p> </p><p>“It is.” Rhea moved over and sat beside her. “...I’ll be there for you. I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth remained silent for a moment, before leaning against Rhea, seeking the only comfort she could. </p><hr /><p>“The Diligent One and the Patient One were my eldest siblings,” Rhea recalled, using her vestments as a pillow while she lay beside Byleth, the two of them staring up into the void, “I remember them being so…impossibly vast compared to me. It hurts, thinking they were reduced to nothing more than ‘relics’ for humanity to kill each other with.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm. I can understand that. I don’t think I’d forgive anyone if they killed Shez,” Byleth commented. Despite her effort to be cordial, she could hear a bit of accusation leak into her words.</p><p> </p><p>Rhea just sighed though. “Yes, you made your point. I feel as though the hypothetical harm I could have caused is outweighed by the very real harm that happened to my people.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I feel like it’s not a competition.” She paused. “...would it be rude to ask which relics they are? I’m sorry if it is, I just don’t have a lot of context outside of them.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Those who bear the Crest of Goneril have the blood of Diligent, while those who bear the Crest of Lamine have the blood of Patient. They were the Kalpa Dragon and the Aegis Dragon.” Rhea let out a wistful sigh. "The Patient One would likely be very amused that the Steadfast’s remains are called Aegis. She was always quite doting." </p><p> </p><p>“Mm…Kind of like Mercedes?”</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose.”</p><p> </p><p>“Neat. Hey, what are Seteth and Flayn’s Nabatean names?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hammer of Judgement and the Benevolent One,” Rhea readily answered, faintly amused by Byleth’s curiosity, “They are an earth dragon and a light dragon, respectively.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Hey, how come Seteth and Flayn have different crests?”</p><p> </p><p>“It likely has to do with young Flayn’s mother. Mixing with a human can have interesting results at times. Light arising from Earth is not impossible, for we all came from the same source. The progenitor formed us all through her will and her magic, and then we spread out. There were those like Seteth, Indech, and Macuil, who were born of basic elements, then there were the direct children of the Goddess herself. In that sense, there were six crests that were sacred: Aegis, Kalpa, Star, Grim, Storm, and Sky, with the last belonging to myself. It was only later that humans tied our crests to human ‘heroes’ and declared them unique.</p><p> </p><p>"Huh…so, were you always a leader?" </p><p> </p><p>"No. I was never meant to lead, I was simply a warrior. Even when we went to war against Nemesis, Wilhelm was the one actually leading our armies." She sighed. “I can give orders in the field, but I have always been better directed by another, working with commanders who have greater tactical acumen than I.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. So why did you become the archbishop?”</p><p> </p><p>“...because it was the only way I felt safe. I had to have control over…everything. It was why I pushed Wilhelm away. I couldn’t handle the idea of letting him have power over me. It's why I recognized the Kingdom and the Alliance too. I felt as if it would let me remain in control while stopping the wars their existence caused." Rhea let out a sigh. "And I decided to completely throw that away because one Agarthan got under my skin." </p><p> </p><p>“Hm? How so?”</p><p> </p><p>“...ah, I suppose it was rather hectic at that point…I declared that the Kingdom is no longer a legitimate nation in a moment of blind fury.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth sat up, giving Rhea an incredulous look. “What? You can do that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Technically, yes, given the Kingdom derives its authority from the Church.”</p><p> </p><p>“...but doesn’t that completely remove their authority over their lands?”</p><p> </p><p>“It…would. If it is upheld, though given my…absence, I cannot imagine things going well.” She paused. “...I may have given both the Empire and Alliance justification to invade the Kingdom. Hm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. That’s exactly what you did. What did this guy even say to upset you so much?”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea sighed, before repeating what Myson said, word for word.</p><p> </p><p>“...” A vein pulsed in Byleth’s forehead. “...I’m going to skin him.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea smiled. “I can help.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth laughed in response, before laying back down, staring up into the darkness. “...I hope we get out of here soon.”</p><p> </p><p>“As do I, child. As do I.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The Fall of Garreg Mach Monastery was an event that would echo throughout the history of Fodlan. As the Year 1180 of the Imperial Calendar came to an end, so too did the balance of power between the continent’s three major nations.</p><p> </p><p>The most changed of the three was the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, which now emphasized the “Holy” aspect of its name to an unsettling degree as the Western Church, once damaged by its members’ ill-fated attempt to take on the Central Church, assumed a new, greater power with its reformation as the Great Church of Faerghus. Under the authority of its recently established archbishop, Cornelia Arnim, the Northern Church, as it would come to be known, officially crowned the former regent of the kingdom, Rufus Thierry Blaiddyd, as its rightful king following his nephew’s disinheritance from the line of succession for the crime of murdering the knights of the Kingdom’s army.</p><p> </p><p>Following his ascension, King Rufus enacted several reforms aimed to expand the power of the nobility he favored while curtailing his political rivals. Most significantly, Duke Rodrigue Achille Fraldarius was imprisoned for conspiracy against the crown, while other major nobles, such as Margrave Gautier, Count Charon, and Count Galatea faced censure and fines for their ties to the supposed conspiracy. </p><p> </p><p>House Galatea, whose holdings were known for their frequent famines, capitulated first of the three, surrendering to the king’s judgment and consenting to have their lands instead managed by a regent of Rufus’s choice in exchange for keeping their titles. House Charon, meanwhile, attempted to hold out against the royalist army, but was ultimately forced to flee their lands for Alliance territory following a disastrous siege wherein the Count of Charon fought to his last breath. Finally, House Gautier held strong as a true fortress of the north, though it was not long before the besieged house began to feel a hungry sting due to the lack of trade from their southern neighbors, particularly as winter approached once more and the raids from Sreng began in earnest.</p><p> </p><p>Bereft of support from the strongest among them, it was not long before the houses that were not already allied with King Rufus conceded to his authority. As for those who readily supported him, Houses Kleiman, Mateus, Elidure, and Gideon found their fortunes vastly increased by an influx of weapons from the king’s stores and resources from the pillaged Great Houses. </p><p> </p><p>Count Rowe, of course, eagerly joined with the king, proclaiming he was always on his side.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, it was impossible not to mention, in the midst of this new order forming, the tales of how King Rufus was chosen to bear the Crest of Blaiddyd by the goddess herself. Such tales found a disturbing purchase quickly within the nobility of Faerghus, particularly when the newly named Duke Mateus took regency of House Fraldarius’s lands, now bearing that house’s famous crest.</p><p> </p><p>Yet despite his successes, Rufus’s hold on Faerghus was not a complete one, and whispers spread of the young prince who still resisted his uncle’s rule…</p><p> </p><p>With a roar, Dimitri Alexander Blaiddyd swept a group of soldiers with his spear, knocking them onto their backs as he continued charging forward, moving from opponent to opponent without wasting a single second. </p><p> </p><p>"Watch your back!" Felix shouted, deflecting an arrow aimed for Dimitri’s neck, covering the prince who smiled in response. </p><p> </p><p>"But you're already doing that for me." </p><p> </p><p>"Hey come on you two, no time to flirt!" Sylvain joked, trampling over an armored knight as he joined his friends. </p><p> </p><p>"Shut up!" </p><p> </p><p>"Enough chatter, enemy Tyrant coming directly at us!" Ingrid shouted, staying in the air to provide support as she spotted a black clad brute charging them. </p><p> </p><p>"An abomination such as him has no right in the goddess’s world," Mercedes intoned from atop her white steed, a blaze of fire hitting the monster in the form of a Ragnarok, getting the creature to scream but kept moving. </p><p> </p><p>Luckily, an Excalibur cast a second later by Annette put down the undead monster, the massive gale tearing apart the burning corpse and scattering its limbs. “Augh, I hate how they scream now! Why would they even make them do that?! It’s so creepy!”</p><p> </p><p>"I don't think the people who made them really care if they're creepy or not…" Ashe muttered, firing arrows off at some mages before they could blindside the melee combatants. </p><p> </p><p>Remaining silent amongst his chattering classmates, Dedue charged forward, slamming his shield into a demonic beast. With a grunt of exertion, he pushed hard enough to launch the beast on its side. Quickly moving back, he let Yuri rush in, slicing open the soft underside of the beast with ease. </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, you know, I can't help but wish we had someone as reliable as you with the Wolves back in the day." He grinned up at the large man from Duscur. “Would’ve been nice having a solid wall of muscle on my side.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm, I suppose I can accept that praise,” Dedue joked, smiling faintly as he took stock of what else they needed to do to finish the skirmish, “Though, didn’t you have a man filling the role of a ‘solid wall’ on your side back then?”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean Balthus? Oh sure, but he’s more of a brawler than a defender, and I definitely wouldn’t call him reliable.”</p><p> </p><p>Elsewhere, Balthus felt an odd sense of offense, before he shrugged it off and punched out his foe in the underground fighting ring he was taking part in.</p><p> </p><p>“I see. Well, I thank you for the praise anyway,” Dedue replied, before quickly raising his shield to block an arrow from an archer on horseback.</p><p> </p><p>The bow knight scowled as his shot was deflected, before quickly pulling at the reins of his horse and turning to try to flee, only for an arrow from Ashe to pierce into his back and send him falling from the saddle to crash into the ground.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright that should be the last of them," Sylvain said, grinning as the battle came to an end. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank the goddess, hopefully they have some supplies we can take," Annette muttered, as she let out a sigh. </p><p> </p><p>"As if the goddess would grant us such mercy..." </p><p> </p><p>“...Is it me, or does Mercedes seem a lot more like Marianne these days?” Sylvain commented, looking a little concerned.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean…Marianne was always more down on herself,” Ashe pointed out, “Mercedes is kind of…upset with everything. Well, except for Annette and Dedue.” He paused. “I guess Yuri too? Because of that whole ‘Apostle’ thing.”</p><p> </p><p>"Well as long as we can direct it at the people we're fighting, it should all be okay," Ingrid said, landing beside them. </p><p> </p><p>"Come on Mercy, I'm sure the goddess will give us something nice for dealing with people actively going against her," Annette said, gently guiding her friend off the battlefield. </p><p> </p><p>"Well if nothing else, little miss short and sweet definitely knows how to handle her," Yuri remarked, very amused. </p><p> </p><p>“True…though does anyone else find it kinda concerning she’s started wearing white armor and riding a white horse?” Sylvain asked, earning some weird looks, “Hey, I’m just saying, considering who her brother is, I’m starting to wonder if we’ll see her put on a skull helmet and call herself ‘The Life Knight’.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a terrible idea, Sylvain,” Yuri retorted, mock-frowning up at him, “Obviously she’d be ‘The Sacred Knight’.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, sure, that’s the issue there.”</p><p> </p><p>Off to the side, Felix, Dimitri, and Dedue looked over the battlefield. "Most of the men here seem to be Gideon's forces. They must be stretching thin if they're down here in Charon territory." </p><p> </p><p>"Then that just means we're making headway," Felix pointed out. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, but…I can't help but wonder just how many people will be left once the war is over at this rate." Dimitri sighed. “I knew my uncle had sided with those monsters, but I thought even he wouldn’t want to rule over a kingdom of the dead.”</p><p> </p><p>“Considering those monsters he’s working with can raise the dead, I don’t think he cares about the living,” Felix remarked.</p><p> </p><p>“Faerghus is a large country,” Dedue pointed out, “We may be surrounded with death at the moment, but I can’t imagine every part of the kingdom looks this bad.”</p><p> </p><p>“So we should just ignore the rumors that Rufus is burning villages that don’t, or can’t, pay his raised taxes?”</p><p> </p><p>"No, but we mustn't lose ourselves. The people of Faerghus are strong, you know this as well as I." </p><p> </p><p>Dimitri let out a sigh, turning his attention away from them as he let his mind wander. It was hard to imagine three years had passed since that fateful day at the monastery. Losing Count Charon had been a bad blow to their burgeoning resistance, but they’d still managed to hold strong…so far, at least. </p><p> </p><p>It turned his stomach to think that he and his friends had basically become bandits, raiding the Kingdom for supplies and striking at the knights that were meant to protect the people. But then he remembered those refugees they brought to Abyss, whose faces lit up with open joy when they returned after these raids, and some of that conflict subsided.</p><p> </p><p>One day, he would make things right in Faerghus. For now though, his mind drifted to his former schoolmates as he felt himself wondering just what was happening in the other countries of Fodlan.</p><hr /><p>Of the three nations, the Alliance was the least directly affected by the fall of Garreg Mach, yet that did not mean it remained untouched. Much like always, the Alliance stood divided. </p><p> </p><p>After the death of 'Acheron’ at Garreg Mach, the forces of Count Gloucester, and those remaining of Count Ordelia, refocused their efforts into taking back the stolen land. With no heir to take over with the lord’s demise, House Phlegethon should have dissolved, yet his forces somehow held firm, claiming to be under the authority of “Lady Cocytus”, who declared the land a part of the “The Principality of Hrym” started by the rebelling Duke Ludwig von Aegir, formerly of Adrestia.</p><p> </p><p>With the rebel state’s support, Phlegethon maintained its grip on Ordelia territory and effectively cut the Alliance off from the Empire entirely, heavily disrupting trade and causing a great deal of trouble for those Alliance houses that wished to ally with Adrestia.</p><p> </p><p>Sadly, aid would not come easily to Gloucester and Ordelia. </p><p> </p><p>House Riegan was forced to focus on defending their own land from Kingdom invasions, which, while not as many, were no less fierce than those attacking the Empire, particularly as they pushed into Daphnel territory, all while threatening to subsume the smaller houses of Siward, Albany, and Burgundy. House Goneril, in contrast, found themselves facing unexpected raids from the East as Almyra saw the chaos engulfing Fodlan and found an opportunity to damage their longstanding foes.</p><p> </p><p>House Edmund, largely safe from the invasions by land, surprisingly wanted to establish contact with the Emperor. This decision appeared to be in part due to the sudden “disappearance” of the House’s heiress, Marianne von Edmund, who had wound up on the other side of the country after following her classmates in the Black Eagles. Otherwise though, Edmund made few moves towards aiding their fellow Alliance members.</p><p> </p><p>With their attention divided, the Alliance made no move towards quelling the current chaotic state of Fodlan. Yet the wheels of politics never stopped turning…</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, so here goes our first meeting of the new year,” Claude began, clapping his hands together to catch everyone at the Roundtable’s attention, “And, uh…well three out of five isn’t bad.”</p><p> </p><p>“So Margrave Edmund isn’t planning to attend at all?” Lorenz inquired, frowning, “He’s not even sending a representative?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, turns out he’s pretty focused on trying to link up with the Empire. Well, the half of the Empire that’s still loyal to the Emperor. Or I guess the third that’s still loyal and isn’t currently invaded by the Kingdom? Speaking of which, Judith! Nice to have you attending one of these.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks Claude.” The current head of House Daphnel stood up from her place at the table, nodding to the far younger representatives present. “As you all likely know already, Count Ordelia has chosen to have his house step down as one of the Great Houses of the Alliance, and chose House Daphnel as their interim representative. I imagine we’ll have to actually talk about who’s going to be the real fifth Great House when we get a chance, but this announcement is just to make things official.”</p><p> </p><p>“So what’s that mean for Lysithea?” Hilda asked.</p><p> </p><p>“As far as I know? She’s renounced her noble title and the Ordelia line is going to die out. They don’t exactly have cousins to take things over.” Judith glanced over at Lorenz. “Isn’t your father taking care of things there?”</p><p> </p><p>“That does seem to be the plan, yes. House Gloucester will be taking the lands of Ordelia and Phlegethon and distributing them to branches of our household.” He grimaced. “Once it is properly seized, at least.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a lot of land you’re taking there,” Claude noted.</p><p> </p><p>“Well we would be willing to distribute the land to those assisting in the reclamation of Ordelia territory…if anyone would actually bother to help.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, come on, we’re busy helping with the Almyran thing!” Hilda complained, frowning, “You know, the thing that <em> we’re </em> not getting support for?”</p><p> </p><p>“I was under the impression that House Albrecht was aiding–”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, Baltie helping us out doesn’t count as House Albrecht helping. He’s not part of them, and they’re not helping us, <em> even though </em> they’re trying to say they should get to be one of the Great Houses.” She huffed, crossing her arms over her chest, before giving Lorenz a look. “Also, isn’t Baron Muller helping out you guys?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well…true, she is, but–”</p><p> </p><p>“So that’s not no one.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I would simply prefer that we have more support. After all, there are other houses in Leicester capable of helping–”</p><p> </p><p>“Who? I mean obviously there’s Albrecht, but we’ve already established Lady Albrecht is a bitch who isn’t helping, and then there’s the trio of Albany, Siward, and Burgundy, who are dealing with, what, Lady Judith?”</p><p> </p><p>“Frequent invasions from the Kingdom,” Judith answered.</p><p> </p><p>“There we go! Frequent invasions. So that leaves, who? Claude, who’s also dealing with everything going on and did actually send troops your way, or…oh, maybe House Nilsson? Are they having any issues from the invading Almyrans? No? Really? Oh, no, wait, they are! <em> And </em> they’re also taking care of the church people who survived because, right, the Central Church is gone. So…yeah. Are you still complaining?”</p><p> </p><p>"I am not complaining. I am merely stating what the situation is," Lorenz said with a sigh. "And for the record, Baron Muller isn't asking for any of the land. She is instead asking for Shamir to be handed to her for her assistance." </p><p> </p><p>That prompted pauses from everyone present. </p><p> </p><p>“...Like…Shamir Nevrand?” Claude asked, “The Dagdan knight of Seiros?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. I…do not know many people with the name Shamir. And she was quite specific.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Hilda, in a display of uncharacteristic seriousness, folded her hands and gave Lorenz a very unimpressed look. “Lorenz. Did you promise to give over a human being to a baron in exchange for her assistance?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No, of course not! I have already stated as much to her, yet she seems to be obsessed with her! I don't even know what for! As far as I'm aware Shamir doesn't owe her any outstanding debts." </p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, makes no sense at all why she would want to grab her without a reason,” Hilda murmured, rolling her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"So, the criminality of some of our houses aside, we’re dealing with a lot right now. So far, we’ve been able to hold everything back, but we’re facing invasions on three sides because of Hrym, Faerghus, and Almyra. I know the Knights have been chipping in as much as they can, but even they’re getting stretched thin,” Claude noted, frowning down at the map spread across the table.</p><p> </p><p>“Catherine has been a big help trying to hold back Faerghus,” Judith remarked, “And as cynical as it might sound, hosting the remnants of House Charon is probably a big reason why she’s so willing to help instead of trying to search for the archbishop like the other knights.”</p><p> </p><p>“Shamir has been helping out a lot on our end too,” Hilda pointed out, “Those arrows of hers are really good for taking out Almyran wyvern knights. Or, well, wyvern whatever-they-call-them.”</p><p> </p><p>“Cataphracts,” Claude commented off-handedly, still frowning at the map, “...if we could focus all our attention on one problem at a time, we might be able to just deal with one and be done with it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, and if our enemies would conveniently decide to lay down their arms and armor, we would win just as easily,” Lorenz retorted, annoyed, “We need solutions here. Obviously the so-called Principality is our largest threat at the moment given they have actually seized our land and have the opportunity to push in further!”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know about that,” Judith remarked, “Faerghus has hit our trio of minor houses again and again and I’m pretty sure they’re starting to waver. Burgundy had a pretty bad harvest last year because of all the farms being burned and Siward doesn’t exactly have the strongest backbone.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll admit, I’m kinda surprised Albany didn't jump just to be contradictory,” Claude commented, before glancing at Hilda, “So, let me guess, things are bad enough in Goneril that you can’t afford sending troops?”</p><p> </p><p>“Honestly, we might be able to,” Hilda admitted, “The problem is…okay, you know how a little while after the monastery fell, that Shahid guy tried invading again?”</p><p> </p><p>Claude grimaced. “Yeah, I know, and I think I know what you’re about to say. Someone else is running things over there now, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s my guess. Either that or Shahid got a lot smarter after losing again, because now we keep having to deal with sudden, staggered attacks, over and over again. There’s just enough of a lull for us to start getting comfortable before they suddenly hit us again, somewhere we weren’t looking, and it’s making a lot of trouble for us. We’re nowhere close to cracking, sure, but it means that we can’t send troops away from the front or else we might actually see them break through.” She sighed. “With the church guys helping out, we have just enough people to garrison all the forts. Maybe we can start pulling things away, but we'd probably only be able to send a squad at most.</p><p> </p><p>She sighed again, pouting. “That’s not to mention how I actually have to put in all this effort now…”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that’s the real travesty here,” Claude agreed, grinning, “Alright, well, while I try to figure out how I’m going to handle this next year of running around, putting out fires, let’s just check in real quick. I know Ignatz is with your guys, Lorenz, and last I heard Raphael’s helping out at the Locket, so my big question is where’s our wayward mage and mercenary?”</p><p> </p><p>“I presume you refer to Lysithea and Leonie, given, well…” Lorenz trailed off, the mood visibly lowering as everyone thought of Shez, before he shook it off. “Well, while she might have renounced her title, Lysithea is still upholding her noble prestige by assisting those towns that need aid along the borders of Ordelia. She’s contributed a bit to our efforts at retaking the land, but primarily, she and Leonie have been dealing with issues like bandits attempting to prey on those displaced by the conflict.”</p><p> </p><p>"Well, hopefully they have fun with that," Hilda muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh I'm sure they will," Lorenz said, quite amused, "Don't tell Lysithea I mentioned this, but she has quite the obvious crush on Leonie." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Both Hilda and Claude stared at the purple-haired noble incredulously. </p><p> </p><p>“...I have to say, these meetings have been getting a lot better since you kids took charge,” Judith commented, openly amused.</p><hr /><p>The Empire of Adrestia, under its recently crowned Emperor Edelgard von Hresvelg, soon found itself in its own unfortunate circumstances directly following the Fall of Garreg Mach as the empowered Kingdom quickly began striking at its southern neighbor. Bolstered by its empowered knights, Faerghus waged bloody war, seeking to conquer the lands to its southwest in a war of retribution against those it claimed to have started the Tragedy of Duscur. </p><p> </p><p>Though the armies of Faerghus failed to hold Garreg Mach itself, finding themselves instead driven off by an unexpected cadre of ‘Reformed Knights’ that struck at their forces, the Kingdom still quickly pushed its armies into rapidly overtaking Houses Barnabas, Martyn, and Gillingr, before claiming the former territory of Arundel as a staging ground from which it continued assaults into the empire’s western half.</p><p> </p><p>While Adrestia would normally be able to strike back against such an assault with its superior numbers and resources, a treacherous attack from the east caught them off guard. The newly freed Duke Aegir was quick to take advantage of the attack on the monastery and moved with the aid of his Agarthan allies to strike before the Emperor could properly return, escaping from custody and forming his own nation known as the “Principality of Hrym” in honor of its base of operations (and a slight attempt on Aegir’s part to hedge his bets by not attaching his own name directly to the new faction).</p><p> </p><p>Though the newly established Archduke Aegir and his Agarthan allies did not manage to take the capital, the damage they caused to the palace and the imperial city as they made their escape heavily disrupted Emperor Edelgard’s early attempts to maintain order in the capital. This, along with the surge of refugees of the monastery, meant the Emperor was forced to focus inward while she attempted to wrest control of Adrestia away from those seeking to ruin it.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, her efforts would be further stymied when the Agarthans struck all at once in a trio of brutal assassination attempts against the Ministers of Domestic, Military, and Religious Affairs. Ultimately, Count Leopold von Bergliez managed to survive the attempt on his life and even slew the entire team of assassins sent to murder him, though not without sustaining heavy wounds and a near-crippling injury. In addition, his firstborn son was killed during the assassination attempt, leaving House Bergliez without a crest-bearing heir.</p><p> </p><p>Similarly, Count Waldemar von Hevring was saved from his own potential demise by the timely intervention of Ladislava, a member of the Emperor’s personal guard who had been delivering a message to the count at the time and managed to save him from being sliced open by the assassins, though not without both of them sustaining injuries. Luckily, such injuries were not lethal, but they still put the count out of commission when he would have been needed.</p><p> </p><p>Finally and tragically, Count Varley, who had been under house arrest during these events, was successfully assassinated by a group of Agarthan assassins, who quite brutally stabbed the former minister to death despite his protests that he was on their side. Reportedly, his daughter passed out from the news, though witnesses of the event remarked that the young woman had a strangely relieved expression on her face.</p><p> </p><p>Even with these losses, the Emperor fought back with all the force she could. Bolstered by the aid of the remaining loyalist nobles and the famed mercenary, Jeralt Eisner, Edelgard von Hresvelg held firm against enemies on all sides, though striking back against her foes had been difficult for the young emperor, particularly as the forces of the Principality managed to seize a great deal of Bergliez and Varley territory during the opening years of the war.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, life for the former Eagles did achieve a sort of normalcy in the midst of the chaos that surrounded them…</p><p> </p><p>Dorothea still wasn’t used to waking up in such a luxurious bed. Even during her time at the Opera Company while the beds might have been nice, there wasn't much privacy given they tended to be three or four divas in a single room. And while there were the 'private' rooms, there was little comfort to be had there for her. </p><p> </p><p>Regardless, she would have been okay in the large bed if she had company, yet she was unfortunately used to waking up alone. </p><p> </p><p>Dorothea let out an annoyed sigh as she sat up in bed and brushed a hand through her long, messy hair. She’d need to properly brush it–Though, no, she had maids that did that…Goddess, that was still strange. It wasn’t like she hadn’t had people help her with her hair before, it was pretty common back at the opera company to help each other out like that, but none of them had worn cute maid outfits while doing it. Well, except for that one time Adrienne was playing a maid…</p><p> </p><p>Still, it's not like she could exactly blame Edelgard; the former songstress only went to sleep long after midnight. </p><p> </p><p>Really all the Eagles were running themselves ragged after the battle at Garreg Mach, but they still made sure to sleep. Sighing as she got up, Dorothea began to brush her hair, doing her best to make herself presentable before tossing a robe over her nightwear. Putting on her slippers since it would be silly to walk around barefoot, the Diva went out to Edelgard’s office. </p><p> </p><p>Walking down the halls, Dorothea greeted those who she saw along the way. She didn't think she'd ever get used to people bowing to her, but that was the least of her worries. Soon enough she found herself in front of the Emperor's office. Slapping her cheeks, Dorothea did her best to get rid of any remaining sleepiness, before slightly loosening her robe. Nodding to herself, Dorothea put on her best smile and opened the door. </p><p> </p><p>And sure enough, there was her Edie, perfectly dressed in her silver armor and scarlet skirts, her hair tied back in that new braided style of hers…All around, she looked as adorable as always, even if she didn't get to wear that armored dress she wanted to. Shame that she couldn't get it finished yet; apparently it would take another few months at the very least. It was an even bigger shame that she seemed so determined to work herself to death.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Edie~! Hard at work as always?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, Dorothea. Yes, we’ve had another push on the western front, a consequence of the Kingdom’s generals taking some surprisingly risky moves, though they appear to be bolstered by more of those mechanical monstrosities, the Titanuses…” Edelgard murmured, looking through the reports and making notes in between signing orders, “Hubert’s people successfully raided an Agarthan laboratory, so we have notes on their current projects. It seems their leadership is splitting their forces, with Titanuses being used in the Kingdom while demonic beasts, which they refer to as ‘Ladons’ and ‘Delphons’, are being used by their Imperial allies, which means they’re appearing in both Empire and Alliance territory, which raises questions–”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re saying ‘which’ a lot,” Dorothea noted, amused.</p><p> </p><p>“I am? Oh, I suppose I am…It is a concern though. I would have thought they would abandon Ordelia territory with the death of ‘Acheron’, but they managed to keep it as a sort of buffer for years at this point. Maybe they’re more invested in Ordelia than I thought? Perhaps…" She sighed, shaking her head before finally looking up, "Regardless we–..." </p><p> </p><p>Dorothea couldn't help but smirk as Edelgard looked away, her face a bit pink. Though in her defense Dorothea had loosened the robe even more while she had been talking. "Heh, seems even a big, strong emperor can get all blushy." </p><p> </p><p>“M-Mm. You don’t…I do not need ‘comforting’ right now–”</p><p> </p><p>“Then why don’t we have some fun because I want to, hm?” Dorothea asked, walking closer. "I mean, we're both aware how sturdy your desk is." </p><p> </p><p>“...I feel…that might not be…appropriate–”</p><p> </p><p>“Did anyone complain?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard glanced to the side, her face warm. "I-It's early isn't it?" </p><p> </p><p>"True. In that case," With a grin, she tapped Edelgard on the nose, "How about some breakfast?" </p><p> </p><p>“...Ah. You were teasing me.” She huffed. “...Breakfast would be good.”</p><p> </p><p>"That it would. So come on, let's go get some food." </p><p> </p><p>"Are you not going to get dressed first?" </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, but this robe is so comfy. But fine, I'll go get dressed, while you go save us a seat," Dorothea said, grinning as she tied her robe close. </p><p> </p><p>"I will, I just need to read one more report–" </p><p> </p><p>"So what I'm hearing is I should toss everything off your desk so we can have fun?" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Edelgard tried to fight the temptation, well aware that it would set her back if all her papers were tossed about. “...I’ll head to the dining room.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm…or you could help me change. Just so I know you’re not sneaking off to work when you shouldn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard sighed, before getting up to follow the songstress. </p><p> </p><p>Soon enough, the songstress was dressed in a modest yet tasteful dress, though she did have her hair tied in a loose ponytail with a purple ribbon. "There we go, now I'm ready for the day." </p><p> </p><p>"You do look lovely." Edelgard complimented, smiling at her. Dorothea smiled back, before noticing something. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Whiskers, off the vanity," Dorothea pouted as she gently shooed the cat away from the bowl where Snappy was resting. Cute cat or not, she didn't want Byleth’s pet to go missing one day because of him. "I'll make sure to get you some treats later, but Snappy is off limits." </p><p> </p><p>"I still can't believe you saved Snappy," Edelgard said with an amused huff, then grabbed Whiskerton to lower him onto the floor. </p><p> </p><p>"To be fair, all I did was ask Sir Jeralt to grab him when he went to search the monastery. Besides, I didn't want Bylie to get sad when we find her," Dorothea replied, before she let out a small sigh. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, that is a concern…I believe Jeralt is investigating the monastery again. He’s been framing it as supporting the western front, but…well, Bergliez has raised concerns about one of our generals heading off on his own for random searches.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. Well Count Bergliez could just take the suggestion to have a task force searching for Bylie at all times instead of having it be ended after a year–”</p><p> </p><p>“Trust me, if it was up to me I would be having our forces scouring the monastery everyday,” Edelgard said, frowning as she remembered the missive she received from the minister about not wasting resources on the dead. </p><p> </p><p>“I know, I know, you miss her too…I just…I wish I knew what happened. I know she has to be okay, she’s…she’s Bylie, there’s no way she wouldn’t be fine. But…” Dorothea sighed. “I just want to know why she didn’t come back…”</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sure she has her reasons. Who knows, maybe she and Shez were on their way here and just got lost. Maybe by the time we find them, they'll have taken over Almyra," Edelgard joked, trying to lighten the mood. </p><p> </p><p>"...Not to be rude, but I really don't think Shezzie should be in charge of a nation," Dorothea replied, biting back a chuckle. "I mean, I think she was trying to argue with Bylie over whether cats are smarter than humans one time." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…well, I don't know, but I would say Whiskerton is smarter than Bergliez, wouldn't you say?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah but our cat is the smartest in the land. Perhaps we should make him Emperor?" </p><p> </p><p>"Who do you think I have named as my successor?" </p><p> </p><p>Dorothea immediately burst into giggles, before trying to stifle them. “E-Edie, please–”</p><p> </p><p>“You have to admit, he would be much better at the job than the majority of the nobles in the Empire. And I'm sure we can retire in peace with him in charge," Edelgard said, trying not to laugh as Dorothea giggled. </p><p> </p><p>"Tr-Truly this will be the greatest reign of the Empire, second only to yours of course." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…no, I think he would do a much better job," Edelgard decided, before laughing when Dorothea burst out giggling again. She wrapped her arms around her as the songstress leaned in close. Even as the Diva stopped giggling and continued to shake, Edelgard held her up. Silently rubbing her back, Edelgard stayed strong. </p><p> </p><p>It was what she needed.</p><hr /><p>Yet for as grand the motivations of those leading Fodlan were, there were those far beneath them that continued to make their own moves. Be it peace or at war, bandits will be around, and someone will need to clean them up. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure you want to be coming along, Miss Lysithea?" Leonie asked, grinning at her ivory-haired friend. </p><p> </p><p>"You don't need to call me Miss, Leonie," the mage grumbled. </p><p> </p><p>"Well you are technically my boss, so…" </p><p> </p><p>"And as your boss, I'm telling you to stop. Besides, this is better than staying cooped up home all day," Lysithea said, guiding her horse along the trail. </p><p> </p><p>"Fair enough, I guess," Leonie said with a shrug. "So what do we know about this bandit again?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well she seemingly works alone, and has a tear shaped mark on her face. While she hasn't harmed any villager, she has extorted them for 'protection' money after clearing out any other nearby bandits." Lysithea grimaced. “Supposedly, she has some ‘inventive’ ways of dealing with bandits that try to operate wherever she sets up her ‘territory’.”</p><p> </p><p>"Eesh, sounds like we're dealing with some wacko. You sure you're up for this?" </p><p> </p><p>"I am. I could probably handle this on my own if my parents weren't insistent I take a bodyguard." </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I’m not going to argue with you. I’m just curious how you think we’re going to find this ‘Teardrop Bandit’. She tends to move around, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“True, but she has certain villages that she frequents, and there were sightings reported recently in this area. So if we check these forests–” </p><p> </p><p>That was when a human body dressed in mercenary gear smashed through a nearby bush and landed on the path in front of them.</p><p> </p><p>“...hm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well that’s either a good sign, or a bad one,” Leonie remarked, before glancing at the mercenary, “Hm…hey, you alive?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hhhhhh…”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, he’s alive. So probably a better sign than a bad one?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm.” Lysithea decided not to respond to that in favor of veering off the path and instead following the trajectory the mercenary had taken. And sure enough, she and Leonie found themselves in a clearing surrounded by broken trees and groaning mercenaries, with the apparent leader of the bunch being held up by the front of her armor by a cloaked woman holding a pitch-black sword.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, ‘Captain Berling’, you’ve got one chance to tell me who hired you to go after me before I start checking how many fingers you can lose without crying,” the woman stated, her sadistic smile showing clearly in the shadows of her cloak.</p><p> </p><p>“G-Gh…y-you’re a monster…” the mercenary choked out, earning a laugh from the woman.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you think I’m a monster?” The woman’s cloak shifted before a trio of bladed tails rose out from it, their points aimed at Berling’s eyes and throat. “Then why don’t I show you how monstrous I can–Eh?”</p><p> </p><p>The woman paused, then turned her gaze towards Lysithea and Leonie. The mage stiffened as she caught sight of a pale face and crimson eyes, before she glared straight at the Agarthan–</p><p> </p><p>“Hang on…is that you, pipsqueak?” The Agarthan stared at Lysithea, her confusion turning to elation as she recognized her. “It is! How's it been– Woah!" </p><p> </p><p>Ducking, the Agarthan dodge a Dark Spike aimed at her, tossing the mercenary captain to the side as Leonie charged forward with her spear. </p><p> </p><p>"We'll give you one chance to surrender, Agarthan, or else we'll settle this with force!" Lysithea commanded, being careful not to use too much magic with all the injured nearby. </p><p> </p><p>"What the hell?! I know I left without saying anything, but you guys are being way too rude!" Kronya complained, bringing her sword up to deflect Leonie’s spear. </p><p> </p><p>Lysithea’s eyes narrowed. “You left? What are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>“The academy, duh! You know–Wait, hang on.” The Agarthan held up a hand and sheathed her sword, before fiddling with her cloak’s clasp and tossing away the garment, showing the…interesting outfit she was wearing, along with her bright orange hair. “Okay, see? It’s me!”</p><p> </p><p>“…” Lysithea glanced at Leonie. “Is she a relative of yours?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wh–Not everyone with orange hair is related,” Leonie complained, frowning at her friend, “You sound like Shez.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right, I only ever revealed my identity to Shez…” The Agarthan sighed, looking put out. “Can’t believe I forgot that…then again, I haven’t interacted with any of you in…three years?” She tilted her head, thinking, before shrugging. “Well whatever. So, hi, I’m Kronya, but you guys knew me as Emily because I was in disguise to keep an eye on Edelgard, but then all that stuff happened and I joined the Golden Deer, and then later I defected from Agartha because of Shez and Professor Byleth.”</p><p> </p><p>“…what.”</p><p> </p><p>Kronya blinked, staring at her baffled former classmates. “Okay, what part did I lose you at? I thought I explained things pretty concisely.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Everything you just said is confusing." </p><p> </p><p>"Seriously? And here I thought you were the smart one…wait, where's Shez? She can clear this up," Kronya said, looking around, "Or the professor, I talked with her before I left." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Leonie and Lysithea shared a glance, before the mercenary stepped forward. "Okay, look, Kronya was it? Do you have any proof about what you're talking about?" </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Oh yeah totally, I keep it on me all the time." Kronya said, before reaching up under her top. Blushing, Lysithea looked away as the Agarthan pulled out a folded piece of paper. "Here we go! Professor Byleth gave this to me!" </p><p> </p><p>Unfolding it, she showed the two what was on it. </p><p> </p><p>"...A certificate of graduation?" </p><p> </p><p>"That does look like the professor's handwriting…"</p><p> </p><p>"That's because it is! Now do you believe me?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'll at least extend you the benefit of the doubt," Lysithea muttered. "We still need to talk about what you're doing." </p><p> </p><p>"What I'm doing? These guys are the ones who attacked me!" </p><p> </p><p>"That's because people think you're a bandit," Leonie pointed out, getting Kronya to stare at her. </p><p> </p><p>"What? No I'm not, I'm a mercenary." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Lysithea felt a headache coming on as she sighed. "Look, we can talk about this later. Let's just make sure everyone here is okay, and check on the villages and towns to make sure none of them were hurt." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course they haven't been hurt, I've been protecting them!" </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, there was the headache. </p>

  <p>“Huh. So I need to set up a contract with a village ahead of time…or else I’m just extorting money from them,” Kronya repeated, nodding slowly as she absorbed Lysithea and Leonie’s explanation of why she was being regarded as a bandit.</p><p> </p><p>“Yep. There’s a thin line between being a merc and being a bandit, and whether or not people agreed to pay you is that line,” Leonie helpfully explained.</p><p> </p><p>“You could also avoid doing things like leaving severed heads out on spike ‘warnings’,” Lysithea pointed out, “Or, perhaps, not use people as furniture.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, this bitch tried to kill me, I’m allowed to use her as a seat if I want,” Kronya countered while sitting on top of Captain Berling’s back, the mercenary currently struggling to remain on all fours instead of just collapsing to the ground, “And those were warnings for bandits! To keep them away from the villages I was protecting!”</p><p> </p><p>"It doesn't really help if you leave them close enough to the villages that the villagers think you're threatening them," Leonie contradicted, recalling what some of the villagers had said. </p><p> </p><p>"For that matter, you really need to stop delivering bandit chief heads to the village elders' houses." </p><p> </p><p>"Then how are they supposed to know I dealt with the bandits?" Kronya asked, frowning. "Hey, Berling, that's what you do, right?" </p><p> </p><p>"...I mean, our clients do ask for proof, but–"</p><p> </p><p>"See? She agrees with me." </p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t–”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up, Berling,” Kronya ordered, before looking back at her former classmates, “So, what, am I in trouble for doing my job?”</p><p> </p><p>"Well since you were being more of a bandit, yes." </p><p> </p><p>"Ugh. Where's Shez or the professor? They would agree with me," Kronya complained, getting the two former Deer to stiffen. </p><p> </p><p>"Shez? The Violet Demon?" Berling spoke up. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, you know her?" </p><p> </p><p>"Every merc worth their salt in the Alliance knows about her and her sister!" Berling exclaimed, before letting out a sigh. "I actually wanted to go against Jeralt’s mercenaries to prove how tough my group was, but well, after the demon and dragon went missing, it wouldn't be the same." </p><p> </p><p>“They’d probably kill you.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I could beat them–”</p><p> </p><p>“You couldn’t beat me,” Kronya stated quite bluntly.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well…it would be different.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, because they’d kill you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re more likely to kill people than Professor Byleth is,” Lysithea pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, actually…” Leonie scratched her head. “Byleth is pretty direct when it comes to people threatening her sister. And by that I mean the first time I met her, she cut off a guy’s head. Though she supposedly lets threats against her slide." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, Shez mentioned that–Wait, what's this about her and the professor missing?" Kronya frowned, looking down at Berling. “Did you have something to do with this?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No! I have no idea what happened!”</p><p> </p><p>“...I have my eye on you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You also have your ass on her,” Leonie pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, it makes sure she doesn't move." </p><p> </p><p>"Moving on," Lysithea cut in, "Yes, Shez and the Professor are missing. They disappeared three years ago after the battle of Garreg Mach. No one is sure what happened." </p><p> </p><p>"And because of everything going on with Fodlan as a whole, we don't even know what's going on in the Empire or the Kingdom aside from both being caught in a civil war," Leonie further explained. </p><p> </p><p>"...Hm." Nodding, Kronya got up, grabbing Berling to pick her up. "Alright come on, we're going looking for Shez." </p><p> </p><p>"W-Wait, why am I going with you?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not just you, all your goons as well. You lost to me so that means you have to work for me now!" Kronya said, as if that explained everything. "So come on, let's go!" </p><p> </p><p>“Emily–Ah, Kronya, that’s kidnapping,” Leonie pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“So?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s also a crime.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Kronya narrowed her eyes. “...I’m allowed to loot them though, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean rob them?”</p><p> </p><p>“They tried to kill me, I beat them, their stuff is my stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh–”</p><p> </p><p>“If I say yes, can we get going?” Lysithea asked, frowning in open annoyance.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, absolutely,” Kronya agreed without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>“Then yes, you can ‘loot’ them. Just be quick about it.”</p><p> </p><p>Kronya grinned. “Oh don’t worry, I always am.”</p><hr /><p>“I don’t think you needed to strip them naked,” Leonie noted as she followed behind Kronya, who was riding on her ‘newly acquired’ horse, the saddlebags practically bursting with clothes and weapons.</p><p> </p><p>“Course I did. Loot is loot. Besides, I can’t wear the same thing all the time,” the Agarthan replied, her cloak back on and her hood up as she led the way through the forest.</p><p> </p><p>"You say that, but you didn't even change." </p><p> </p><p>"Well yeah. I'm not going to change out in the open, I'm not a perv." </p><p> </p><p>Lysithea felt like she needed to ignore half of everything she said. Letting out a sigh, she chose to study the Agarthan. It was hidden now thanks to her cloak, but the messy orange hair she had was long, reaching below her shoulders. And while she was still pale, she didn't look like a corpse, like the rest of her people. And, well, it was difficult to tell on horseback, but Lysithea was pretty sure she was the same height as Kronya now. </p><p> </p><p>“Sure, sure. So where’s this hideout of yours anyway?” Leonie asked, “And I think I should mention that having hideouts is also a bandit thing to do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh really? You’ve never heard of a mercenary hideout?” Kronya retorted.</p><p> </p><p>“No, because I don’t think those exist.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well they do, so shut up. Anyway, it’s not far, just in these caves I found. Had to run some bears out, but I made it pretty homey afterward.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Where’d the bears go afterward?”</p><p> </p><p>“How should I know? Wherever bears go.”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea tried not to sigh, but Kronya made it very, very difficult. Especially given the fact that her hideout genuinely did look like a bandit’s lair, complete with trophies hanging on the walls, furs being used for bedding, and boxes and barrels filled with supplies placed haphazardly wherever Kronya found room to store them.</p><p> </p><p>"...So this is where you live?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, it's not much but I made it my home," Kronya said, quite proud of herself as she began to dump her new loot further in the cave. </p><p> </p><p>Lysithea remained silent, looking around the cave, before pausing as she saw a Garreg Mach uniform hanging against a wall as well. "...I'm surprised you kept that." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Well it's clothes, so I might as well,” the Agarthan replied while picking out a tunic from her gathered clothes and pulling it on over her leotard. People tended to stare when she went around with just it on. “Got no reason to throw it out." </p><p> </p><p>“So you’re not keeping it for sentimental reasons?” Leonie asked.</p><p> </p><p>“The hell are those?”</p><p> </p><p>“...yeah, alright, I should’ve expected that answer.”</p><p> </p><p>"So…you've just been living here since you left Garreg Mach?" Lysithea asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Not entirely. It was a few months afterwards, I think. Had a few places before this, but this is a nice spot. Keeps me covered and keeps any rain and shit out." Kronya said, as she began to dig around in a box. "You guys want any fruit? Snagged some a few days ago while I was out." </p><p> </p><p>"I'm good." With a frown, Lysithea looked at the Agarthan. "So…was there ever an Emily?" </p><p> </p><p>Pausing before she could take a bite out of an apple, Kronya let out an annoyed sigh. "Yeah. She was grabbed a bit before the school year started. I didn't even know her name was Emily until I got to the academy." </p><p> </p><p>"...So you did kill her?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. She was loud and annoying. Kept screaming at me every day until she died." Kronya frowned as she placed the apple back in the box. "But…there's probably someone that's sad she's gone now." </p><p> </p><p>“So you murdered a girl and took her place,” Lysithea reiterated, her arms crossed over her chest. Her hand clutched at her sleeve as she tried to keep her expression even. “Do you feel at all guilty?”</p><p> </p><p>“...that’s a good question.” Kronya scratched her head, turning and sitting down on a barrel. “...I don’t think I can feel guilt. She wasn’t the first person I killed, and she wasn’t the last either. I’m…meant to kill. I was made for that purpose. And the people I killed on behalf of Shambhala…no matter who they were, my superiors didn’t want them dead for any good reason. I wasn’t a knight hunting down evildoers, I was an assassin sent to kill traitors and obstacles to us. And I enjoyed it. I still enjoy it. Getting to kill people. I can’t stop myself from enjoying it.</p><p> </p><p>“...I want to, though. I…I wish I wasn’t like this anymore. I want to be able to do things because it's what I want, not just because of how they made me." </p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. I’m not a priest and redemption isn’t something I considered myself qualified to speak on,” Lysithea stated, meeting Kronya’s eyes, “As long as you’re on our side, I will consider you an ally.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that works.” Kronya paused. “Are you gonna pay me?”</p><p> </p><p>"Would you prefer looking for Shez and the professor on your own?" </p><p> </p><p>Kronya blinked, before a calculating look entered her eyes. “Ah, I get it. So just like all nobles, you expect me to work for free with just the honor of serving you to fill my belly. For shame, Lysithea, for shame.” She looked at her ‘fellow mercenary’. “You’re with me on this, right Leonie?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Well, I am getting paid…" </p><p> </p><p>"...Of course you have favorites," Kronya grumbled as she frowned at Lysithea. </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, well, I’m not getting paid by her–”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t talk to me, scab.”</p><p> </p><p>"How do you even know what that word means?" </p><p> </p><p>"I can read." Kronya huffed, reaching into a different box and pulling out a few books. "Unlike you guys, I continued my education." </p><p> </p><p>"...Goddess, how are you even more annoying?" Lysithea asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Like I said, I continued my education. Unlike you.”</p><p> </p><p>"Well, I mean, we are at war,” Leonie pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, so what? I still had time to read, scab." </p><p> </p><p>"Stop calling me a scab!" </p><p> </p><p>"Stop being one!"</p><p> </p><p>“Would you two knock it off?!” Lysithea demanded, “Kronya, are you willing to help us or not?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I am! That should be obvious! I just want to be paid for any non-Shez related activities.”</p><p> </p><p>“How would you even quantify that?” </p><p> </p><p>“If Shez isn’t involved, I’ll nag you until you pay me.”</p><p> </p><p>“And what about when we find Shez?”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I’ll be content. We can talk about any further jobs afterwards."</p><p> </p><p>"Right, that sounds good enough," Lysithea said. "For now, we need to just continue checking on villages, then we can head back to Castle Gloucester.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? Isn’t that Lorenz’s place?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup, he’s been supporting us in checking things out,” Leonie explained, “Since Ordelia’s still under the control of House Phlegethon–”</p><p> </p><p>“Who?”</p><p> </p><p>“Acheron’s house,” Lysithea explained, earning a blink from Kronya.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s still alive?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, he died at Garreg Mach, apparently. The current head claims to be his cousin or sister or something stupid, considering she’s never been seen before.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Weird. And they’re the people that took over your territory, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“They are, yes,” Lysithea answered, plainly getting annoyed, and even Kronya wasn’t that oblivious.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…so do you have any plans to take back your castle?” She wasn’t oblivious, but she was still pretty thoughtless.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. Count Gloucester and my family’s forces are handling that. I’m willing to aid if they ask for me, but maintaining order and protecting the people comes first.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, that makes sense. And hey, there probably isn’t anyone left in the castle that isn't on Phlegie’s side. Anyone else would’ve been killed ages ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Lysithea sighed. “You didn’t need to mention that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah yeah, so what’s next? Are we going after any real bandits?”</p><p> </p><p>“I just said what we’re–Ugh, never mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Leonie chuckled. “Gotta say, it’s nice having you back, Emily. And wow does it feel weird saying that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, it’s been nice seeing you too…ah…”</p><p> </p><p>“...Leonie.”</p><p> </p><p>“I knew that."</p><hr /><p>The world had changed, and nothing would make it change back. Yet the war that consumed Fodlan hadn’t touched every part of the continent. For one lone village, hidden in the mountains, things remained largely at peace…aside from the presence of a lone girl who had returned to her first home.</p><p> </p><p>Letting out a sigh as she pulled her arrow out of a deer she had just shot, Shez lifted up her kill onto her shoulder, the weight settling easily in her grasp. It wasn't much, but it would hopefully last her the month. Things had changed, but at least meat was still the same. </p><p> </p><p>She had changed especially. Her hair was different; cut shorter, though still messy, with her awakened form’s coloration permanently in shading her locks the color of a sunset. Well, she was pretty sure it was permanent since it wasn’t going away. She’d taken to wearing longer sleeves and pants too, to hide the white markings that decorated her body, and a red-orange scarf kept her safe from the cold…even if it did mean she was kind of hot after getting a workout.</p><p> </p><p>Wiping the sweat off her forehead, the girl walked back up the trail to her home. She had to admit, she didn't think she would end up back here of all places when she first started wandering, but in another way, it made sense. This was the place she first ended up alone; it was fitting it was where she ended up when she was alone again. </p><p> </p><p>Her mother’s house hadn’t been maintained while she was gone. She didn’t think it would be, not when she was gone for years, but it was still sad coming back and seeing it falling apart. A good chunk of her time these past few months was spent fixing it all up, in between her big project. She wasn't really a carpenter, but she could at least patch up holes. </p><p> </p><p>A decent amount of that time was also spent yelling at the village head who kept trying to get her to leave, so that was fun at least. Still, she was able to get the place decent enough. The fireplace kept things warm, the roof kept the rain out, and she’d got a good amount of jerky stocked up–</p><p> </p><p>“This is pathetic.”</p><p> </p><p>And the only problem was the stupid piece of shit still in her head. “You’re pathetic, you vile bastard.”</p><p> </p><p>“As you have stated previously, yet you are the one–”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” she responded. There wasn’t really any vehemence in her voice at this point, the response was basically automatic now.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you listen–”</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve gone over this, asshole. Leave me alone, I won’t berate you until you start crying.”</p><p> </p><p>“I never–Ugh.” The sage let out a frustrated noise. "So you’re truly committed to this insane course of action!?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup. And you’re an idiot if you haven’t figured that out yet.” Walking away from the frustrated spirit, Shez got back to her house and started her work on preparing and cleaning the deer. It was an easy routine at this point, and soon enough she had a good store of venison to put away in her cold storage. And once she was done, she headed out again, to a quiet place nearby.</p><p> </p><p>A mound of dirt that had flowers laid on top rested a few minutes away from her home. It had been a shallow hole, but she was happy it hadn't been disturbed while she was gone. Sitting down by it, she stayed silent for a few minutes. </p><p> </p><p>"...Hey, mom, how's it going? Sorry I haven't been visiting often. I’ve been busy down south, trying to figure things out. Patrol routes are a pain to map and those assholes keep way too many beasts around–Ah, sorry for cursing. I do that too much nowadays…I get frustrated easily.” She sighed. “...I think I’m almost there. I…I have to hope I am. I can’t…go back yet, not until…I’m going to get her back. I’m going to get my sister back. Even if…Even if I’m not sure if I deserve to call her my sister anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez brushed at her eyes, letting out a shaky breath. </p><p> </p><p>"You'd probably like her. She'd probably be a great daughter. Better than me, at least." </p><p> </p><p>She didn't hear anything back as she sat there in silence. She didn't know how long she sat there, but she eventually got up and went back home.</p><p> </p><p>"I love you, mom," she murmured, before heading back inside. Her eyes drifted towards the swords she’d collected, hung up on the wall. Her Killing Edge was still good, but maybe she should bring along a couple extras…the Venin could be useful and she liked the Brave… Sometimes she wished she had four arms so she could use more than just two swords.</p><p> </p><p>…maybe that was something she could practice? Not growing arms, but using four swords…three swords were certainly possible if she held one in her mouth. She’d need to practice anyways if she wanted to pull off this big, dumb plan of hers. </p><p> </p><p>But hey, it was the only plan she had.</p><p> </p><p>So she went over to the chest she was keeping some of her stuff in, dug out her notes and the maps she’d acquired, and laid them all out on the table. </p><p> </p><p>“Alright…really wish I was better at reading maps…” Shez sighed, then smacked her cheeks and focused.</p><p> </p><p>After all, she needed to put in a lot of work if she wanted to take Castle Ordelia.</p>

  <p><u> <strong>Three Years Ago</strong> </u> <u></u></p><p>
  <em> Long, long ago, the Agarthan people worshipped the sun. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Shez grimaced, covering her eyes in an attempt to block out the bright, shining sun overhead. The treetops above her didn’t do much to cover it, the light shining through the leaves, and that just put her in a bad mood.</p><p> </p><p>Granted, she was in one already because of…well, for a lot of reasons, really. Not being able to see her friends and family was a very good reason to be upset. Being stuck with the bastard who was the whole reason <em> why </em> she couldn’t see her friends or family was another good reason.</p><p> </p><p>“What is your plan, exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>Her lips twitched almost automatically into a snarl at the sound of that bastard ghost’s voice. She glared up at Epimenides, who floated above her, the prick.</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you give a shit?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you are my vessel–“</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off! I don’t belong to you!” she snapped, her anger echoing through the forest.</p><p> </p><p>“You were made for me.” His retort was blunt, his own annoyance obvious, “You were meant to be mine entirely. Just as your monstrous sister was meant to be a vessel for the abomination.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez took a slow, careful breath. “...you know, I never actually spoke to Sothis. All these months of her following my sister around and I didn’t even hear her voice until she came out to kick your ass.” She glanced up at Epimenides again, glaring at the wraith. “It’s gotta piss you off that she’s still better than you, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“You would not mock me if you knew what that creature had done,” he growled, glaring down at her, “It burned the entire world!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, really.” Shez stood up, then made a show of looking around the forest. “Huh. Huuuuh. See, I’m not saying you’re a lying piece of shit, but the world doesn’t look burned to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“You would think that…this, what you see around you?” He gestured to the forest, a sneer on his lips. “It is <em> nothing. </em> A false world crafted by that monstrosity-“</p><p> </p><p>Shez smacked her hand against a tree. “Sure as fuck feels real to me, you lying sack of garbage.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not lying! I–“</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Epi? Do me a favor and die. I’m gonna figure out where I am.” And with that, Shez began moving through the forest, ignoring the seething spirit. She knew she wasn’t the best with directions, but if she just kept moving, she was bound to find something, right?</p><p> </p><p>Eventually she did, as she stepped out of a forest and found a watchtower, which usually meant there was a town or something nearby. Feeling her stomach growl, she looked around to see if she could find any sign of life. Mostly to get some food. </p><p> </p><p>Her heart stopped as she saw a familiar village in the distance, a place she hadn’t seen since everything in her life changed. “Ah.”</p><p> </p><p>That was Remire Village. It looked the same as it did at the beginning of the year…and that put into a strange perspective just how long it had been since Shez and her family were just a band of traveling mercenaries.</p><p> </p><p>“...huh. That’s a strange sense of nostalgia…” Shez took a slow breath, staring at the town. She could feel tears prick at her eyes before she wiped them away with her arm, trying to keep steady. “Gotta say, I’m glad they’re doing okay…”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides glowered behind her, still irritated. Perhaps that was why his first instinct was to scoff. “Ah yes, bask in the glory that is some backwoods settlement scraping by. This place could burn to the ground and the world would never notice.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez paused mid-step, staring at the village for a second before glaring back at Epimenides. “Don’t fucking touch them!”</p><p> </p><p>“...and why not? I told you before what my intent was if you chose to galavant with beasts.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez’s eyes went wide, then narrowed in a furious glare. “You piece of shit–Fine. Guess I’m not getting breakfast then. Hope you feel every damn hunger pang…”</p><p> </p><p>“You petulant child–”</p><p> </p><p>“You piece of shit,” Shez retorted, glaring straight at the wraith. Then she shook her head and moved back to where she’d first wound up, looking around for– “Ah, there we go.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides watched his vessel with a frown as she crouched down and pulled a familiar sword from the dirt. “The Fell Star’s spine…and what do you plan to do with that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hide it. It’s pretty heavy, so I don’t think it’s a great idea to lug it around with me. That, and I don't want assholes like you to get a hold of it.” She ignored Epi’s angry response in favor of hoisting the sword into her arms with a small huff. “Eesh, Sothis must’ve been a big girl…well, at least her relic doesn’t turn people into monsters. Now let’s see, where should you go…”</p><p> </p><p>It took some traveling before Shez found what she considered an appropriate spot.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you really need to scale a mountain?” Epi complained.</p><p> </p><p>“First off, fuck off. Second off, you make it sound like I climbed all the way instead of warping. Third off, it’s not exactly easy to get up here, now is it?” Shez pointed out, gesturing to the landscape far below her, “Oh and fourth off, fuck you.”</p><p> </p><p>With her point made, Shez turned back to the mountain’s peak and pulled the Sword of the Creator up. Her muscles strained for a moment at how heavy it was, before she jammed it into the rock, shoving it forcefully into the mountaintop. It pierced through the stone, and when she let go, it stood straight and tall at the top of the world.</p><p> </p><p>“There. There…” Shez stared at the sword for a moment, then took a small, shaky breath to steady herself. “…I’m sorry, Byleth. I’m so sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>There was no response. Just a cold breeze.</p><hr /><p>
  <em> There were other gods, of wind and water, of storms and land, and yet the Sun was held sacred above all else, for it gave life to the world. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Shez watched the crackling campfire dance in front of her. It’d been a long time since she was this alone. But what else was she supposed to do? Epimenides made it clear what would happen if she tried heading for any village or town, so how was she supposed–</p><p> </p><p>“Hello there!”</p><p> </p><p>She stiffened, her eyes widening at the voice that rang out through the woods. She’d stuck to the deeper parts of the forest for the past weeks, away from the main roads, so why was there some random guy out here? “Uh…hi?”</p><p> </p><p>The guy, a partially bearded man with thick sideburns and a bowl cut, seemed friendly enough as he walked over, smiling. “What’s a young lady like you doing out in the woods so late at night?”</p><p> </p><p>“...sitting. Eating.” Shez resisted the urge to glance around. She didn’t want to somehow bring out Epimenides by looking for him. “I, uh…I’m traveling at the moment.”</p><p> </p><p>“All alone? You should be more careful, there’s a war on these days,” he said while walking over, before pausing, “Oh, where are my manners? I’m Pallardo, a merchant traveling with my caravan.”</p><p> </p><p>“A merchant?” Yeah, she could kinda see that, he did look merchant-y… “Oh, wait, I know you! You were at Garreg Mach, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yes, I was! Ah, you were a student there, weren’t you? I remember seeing you around.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yep, I was. Name’s Shez.”</p><p> </p><p>He blinked, a look of surprise crossing his face. “You’re Captain Jeralt’s daughter! Ah, of course, that makes sense. You must be out here on a mission then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…no, not really. We kinda got separated after the whole…monastery attack.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, that’s a shame. I’m sure your father must be worried about you.”</p><p> </p><p>“...yeah, he…probably is,” she admitted, feeling a pang in her heart at the thought of her dad. But she couldn’t go find him. Aside from the Epimenides problem, it was because of her that Byleth…vanished.</p><p> </p><p>“Then he’d probably pay a great deal to get you back.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I guess–...ah. Shit,” Shez muttered, immediately becoming aware of the group of guys surrounding her camp. She sighed, setting down the half eaten fish she had caught. "Don't do this." </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry to say, but no can do. I have my men to feed, and I'm never one to turn down such a tidy profit," Pallardo said, before smirking. "Especially since I've heard a certain captain is now a general in the Empire. So good news for you, I'm sure daddy dearest will be able to pay your ransom easily enough." </p><p> </p><p>“I thought you said you’re a merchant?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I am. I just need to look for other forms of income these days. This war is hard on everyone.”</p><p> </p><p>“...hm. I’m pretty sure the war has only been going on for a few weeks.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha. You’ve been out here for a while, huh? It’s been more like two months since the whole continent decided everyone should start fighting each other.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. That’s…” Shez sighed, before starting to push herself up, which got a number of spears and arrows pointed at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Why don’t you stay right there?” Pallardo suggested, “We’ll let you up once you toss aside your weapons–”</p><p> </p><p>Then Shez was right behind him, her sword at his throat. “No, I don’t think so. None of you guys move, or I’ll–”</p><p> </p><p>Then her head felt hot. Everything felt hot. Then it was dark and she…she had to…</p><p> </p><p><em> No, this isn’t right. </em> The thought echoed in her mind, a rush that went through her body and she pushed back to awareness, forcing her consciousness back–</p><p> </p><p>And she stumbled, gasping, panting, trying to breathe. She nearly retched, her body trembling from the sudden rush of having to get control of herself…and she was covered in blood.</p><p> </p><p>“...a-ah…aaAAAH!” </p><p> </p><p>Her scream echoed through the woods, blood dripping from her hands, her arms–She buried her head in her hands, trying to calm down, trying to–</p><p> </p><p>“This is what you want? To cavort with self-centered beasts like these vermin?” Epimenides spoke directly into her ear, his voice low. </p><p> </p><p>"Sh-Shut up," Shez ordered, trying to calm herself down, as she refused to look up. She didn't care about the bandits but…gagging as she felt some bile rise up, Shez did her best to choke it down. </p><p> </p><p>"Hmph, is a little blood all it takes now? I seem to remember someone reveling in killing more than the Fell Star," Epimenides remarked, getting Shez to stiffen, “Do you truly–”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sick because YOU STOLE MY FUCKING BODY!” she snapped, glaring straight at Epimenides, “You piece of shit. You–I’m going to <em> end you! </em>”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. An empty–”</p><p> </p><p>“SHUT UP! SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH! I’m going to kill you! I don’t care how I do it, I don’t care how long it takes, I AM GOING TO GOUGE YOUR EYES OUT AND TEAR YOUR HEAD OFF WITH MY BARE HANDS!”</p><p> </p><p>“...your threats are empty. You cannot harm me in any way that matters.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell yourself that. I’m gonna find a way to hurt you. And I’m not gonna stop until you die.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides scowled down at his blood-soaked vessel, ignoring the strange chill that went down his spine at the sheer hatred his former partner regarded him with.</p><hr /><p>
  <em> Yet one day, a new god appeared. A goddess of alabaster flames and emerald light descended from the heavens, garbed in the clothes of royalty. And with her, came blessings inconceivable. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Scowling, Shez flashed forward, her blade carving into a demonic beast’s hide, making it screech in pain. It was difficult, getting used to only wielding one sword at a time again, but she didn't have much of a choice. Not only was she staying away from towns, any bandits she fought against had horribly kept iron swords that would likely snap after a battle or two. </p><p> </p><p>Jumping up to dodge a tail swipe, Shez raised her free hand up, sending a volley of Dark Spikes into the monster's wound, making it scream again, before it collapsed to the ground </p><p> </p><p>Breathing heavily, Shez wiped the sweat on her forehead as she tried to catch her breath. Glancing down at her Killing Edge, she grimaced when she saw it had begun to chip. “Damn it…”</p><p> </p><p>“My, would you look at that? Your sword is beginning to break. If only you had one that would never–”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off, Epi,” Shez muttered, before glancing at the beast’s corpse. “...right, I know these things can have those weird metals in them…or on them. I don’t actually know where Byleth got those bits and I don’t know what to do with them anyway so I have no idea what I’m even trying to do here…fuck.</p><p> </p><p>She let out a frustrated sigh. “...maybe I should just grab those crappy iron swords and stock up on them? Just toss them away when they break…”</p><p> </p><p>“You are a true fool–”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not using your sword, asshole. Not when I’m pretty damn sure you’d use it against me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have no reason to kill you, vessel. I require your body to exist in this world, remember?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I know, and it makes me think bad thoughts about myself, so kindly shut the hell up already!” She sighed again, trying to think of something. “...maybe I can go after those Kingdom assholes? Or maybe find some Agarthans…or just better equipped bandits.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez crossed her arms over her chest, her brow furrowed as she tried to think…before she paused as a shout rang out.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn it all, the beast is down!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, great.” Shez sighed, turning towards the sound and watching as a group of soldiers came down from the nearby hill. Most of them were wearing black armor and…orange tabards. Which, huh. <em> Black armor usually means Empire, but they wear red, not orange…weird. </em> “Uh, hi?”</p><p> </p><p>The soldiers paused, looking amongst each other, before one of them stepped forward. A brown-haired guy with weird pauldrons, which probably meant he was the boss of these guys. “You there! What do you think you’re doing with a beast of the principality, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“...uh…well I killed it.” Something about this guy’s voice sounded familiar.</p><p> </p><p>“You expect me to believe that one woman managed to slay a demonic beast? Ha! You don’t look like anything special to me!”</p><p> </p><p>“...sure.” That voice sounded really familiar. “So who are you guys supposed to be? A mercenary band?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ha ha ha! So not only are you stupid enough to lie to us, but you’re ignorant too! You’re addressing an officer of the Principality of Hrym, the new nation that has risen from the ashes of Adrestia!” The man smirked, his expression callous and filled with malice as his men cheered his proclamation. “Now then, considering you’re claiming to have destroyed principalian property, that means you owe us a debt, and I can think of–”</p><p> </p><p>Shez snapped her fingers. “You’re that fucker that kidnapped Byleth! During the Aelfric thing!”</p><p> </p><p>Metodey paused. Then he took a second look at the purple-haired woman who claimed to have killed a demonic beast single-handedly. Then he really looked, staring straight at her while sweat began to bead down his forehead.</p><p> </p><p>“...uh, Sir Metodey?” one of the Hrym knights spoke up, “Are you feeling–”</p><p> </p><p>And Metodey promptly bolted in the other direction.</p><p> </p><p>“...” The knights watched their leader scrambling to get away, then turned to look at Shez, who was grinning. </p><p> </p><p>“You know, I was just thinking I needed to get some new equipment. Any of you got a Killing Edge?”</p><p> </p><p>The knights glanced at one another, before raising their weapons as they got ready to fight. </p><p> </p><p>Approximately ten minutes later Shez was standing over Metodey, twisting his arm as the former mercenary screamed. "You know, I'm surprised your arm still works after how badly it got broken. Or well, worked anyways." </p><p> </p><p>“AHHHH, STOP, STOP, I’M SORRY!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm…so how many people have you killed since joining up with this princely thing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Gh–I-I’m just following–GYAH!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, dang, that actually tore there. Wow. I actually kinda feel bad about that, uh…” She let his arm drop and gave him a pat on his dislocated shoulder. “Sorry. Oh, though, real quick, what’s that princely thing anyway? Also, you said ‘principalian’ earlier? Is that the actual word, or what? I know if a duke runs something, it’s ‘ducal’, so is it ‘principal’? Or is it ‘princal’? Or does princely work?”</p><p> </p><p>Metodey made a faint keening noise.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, come on, you’re the first real person I’ve talked to since…I mean, do I want to count bandits? I’ve said things to bandits a few times but we’re not really talking so much as I’m saying things while destroying them.” Shez paused, then poked him. “You good down there?”</p><p> </p><p>“No…” Metodey weakly murmured.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm, right. Well, I’m going to take your stuff. You actually have some pretty nice swords and that’s good for me because it means I don’t have to use my fancy sword that just so happens to belong to a piece of shit who is so completely shit and worthless that I don’t want anything that’s associated with him.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you say.” Shez stiffened at the cold tone of Epimenides’s voice. “Yet you rely on my power all the same. You travel through the shadows <em> I </em> wield. It is <em> my </em> magic that ensures your survival. Yet you would cast that aside? I do not believe that for a moment, ingrate.”</p><p> </p><p>“…” She took a breath, then got up from Metodey’s back, trying to–</p><p> </p><p>“You would leave vermin like him alive? You truly have–“</p><p> </p><p>She warped away, trying to ignore his voice, his mocking tone–</p><p> </p><p>“Pointless. You cannot hold to your decisions for even a moment–“</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off. They’re my powers, not yours–“</p><p> </p><p>“They are mine. You would have nothing if not for me–“</p><p> </p><p>“I HAVE NOTHING BECAUSE OF YOU!” Shez screamed, her rage a near physical thing as darkness emanated from her body.</p><p> </p><p>“You <em> are </em> nothing without me. You would have been thrown away ages ago were it not for my power.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that’s not true!”</p><p> </p><p>“You know it is. The Fell Star would have outpaced you without my aid. You would have been left behind, the little sister clinging to her coat, desperate to catch up but never making it.” His tone was cold, stoic, as though everything he said was fact. “You reveled in the power I gave you. Finally, you were special. You were better than her. You were stronger, more powerful, <em> you </em> were the one that protected <em> her. </em></p><p> </p><p>“You think I do not know? You think I cannot feel your thoughts, your emotions? I know your triumph and your resentment. I know you could not stand that she saw you as a child to be protected, that she would put herself in danger to keep you safe. You were useless again, unworthy of her love and crushed under her condescension.” His gaze pressed down on her, gleaming with light. “Lie to yourself all you like, for you cannot lie to me. You <em> hated </em> her.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez stared up at him, tears running down her face. Then her sword formed in her hand, and in one swift motion, she twisted it around and rammed the white blade straight into–</p><p> </p><p>It stopped, inches from her neck, as her arm locked in place, though not without twitching and straining. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you think I would allow you to–”</p><p> </p><p>“I think you’re a piece of shit. I think you’re a lying bastard. I think I might’ve been upset, yeah, because I’m stupid. I love my sister. I <em> hate </em> you. And I figured something out.” She bared her teeth, tears staining a maddened smile. “You need me alive. Not that hard to figure out, we’ve talked about it before, but like I said, I’m stupid. It just didn’t click for me that <em> you </em> need me to live. And I sure as hell don’t feel like living right now.</p><p> </p><p>“So here’s how it’s going to go. You can try to fill my head with all kinds of bullshit. You can say I hated my sister or my dad or my mom or whoever else I know for a fact I love with all my heart, and I’ll tell you I fucking <em> hate </em> you.” She giggled, her grin a rictus. “Yeah, see, I remember what that fucker back at the monastery said. If I know one thing, it’s that we Agarthans are spiteful pieces of shit, and you’re the worst of them all because you’re dumb enough to think it means the rest of those assholes would like you.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you remember that, right?! The moment they heard you were back, <em> THEY TRIED TO KILL YOU! </em> Because you can go on and on about my stupid thoughts and feelings that I had when I was being a dumbass, but we both know no one in this world loves you. No one wants you around. And I’m going to remind you of that every single day. You don’t want me to have peace? You don’t want me to have friends or family? THEN I’LL DO THE SAME THING TO YOU, YOU PIECE OF <em> SHIT!” </em></p><p> </p><p>Shez laughed, a cruel, maddened sound as she glared straight at the parasite hooked into her soul. “You might be tied to me, but I’m tied to you too, asshole. And I’m going to make every moment you’re with me <em> hurt </em>.”</p><hr /><p>
  <em> Bolstered by the new god, the civilizations of Agartha grew to untold heights. Yet they felt no gratitude. The Fell Star was not the Sun. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The new paradigm did not suit Epimenides. His vessel, once happy to call him partner, loathed him with all her heart. He had thought that acceptable, a sacrifice made for the good of the world. </p><p> </p><p>One day, she would understand.</p><p> </p><p>He thought to wear her down. To make it clear her purpose, her role. He would sever those foolish bonds she clung to and make her his true vessel. A perfect existence through which they would fix a warped world.</p><p> </p><p>Yet she hated him all the more.</p><p> </p><p>He thought to mock her reliance on his power. He thought to make it clear she needed him. And then she began to use his sword. She began to use his magic. She began to Awaken.</p><p> </p><p>She used his power.</p><p> </p><p>In the recesses of his mind, he could admit to being impressed by his vessel’s change in demeanor. The cold focus with which she began to work. If only she did not respond to his every comment, his every suggestion, his every criticism with vehement vitriol.</p><p> </p><p>At one point she stopped screaming obscenities and simply yelled at the top of her lungs anytime he spoke up. </p><p> </p><p>So, he decided to look upon her in silence as she acted, fighting a group of kingdom soldiers who she had stumbled upon. She cut through them with an efficiency he had never seen of her before, not wasting any of her movements as she cut down anyone before her. </p><p> </p><p>A scowl appeared on his face as a knight managed to gut her with a spear, only for his head to go flying as he pulled back. Even as her body healed with his magic, he knew she could have dodged that. Yet she didn't, because she knew Epimenides needed her more than she needed him. </p><p> </p><p>It was infuriating. The gall she had to claim he was useless to her while wielding his power, while wearing his marks upon her body, while shining like a rising Sun…</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t need him. She needed his power. And he could feel how she pulled on it. How her fury and hate drew in the darkness and wreathed her body in light. She was taking from him.</p><p> </p><p>Her power was inherited. It was his by right. He had worked to rival a god and she took it from him with every furious breath.</p><p> </p><p>Something had to be done.</p><hr /><p>
  <em> The Agarthan people sang songs of war and told legends of great battles. Their drive in battle was to prove their superiority. It was only natural the city-states of Agartha would one day turn their blades away from their rival humans, and instead towards the god in their midst. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Despite her efficiency in dealing with threats, there was no purpose Epimenides could see behind Shez’s actions. She struck at bandits, knights of the Kingdom, and soldiers of the Principality specifically, so her slaughter was not indiscriminate. </p><p> </p><p>In fact, she was often very particular and focused, keeping watch on a specific group for some days or even weeks, scouting their strengths, weaknesses, and purpose, before moving in to destroy them utterly and raiding what supplies they had. She showed no mercy to those she had chosen to target, and more than once he had watched as she pierced a fleeing soldier through the back. Otherwise, she spent her time keeping on the move, sticking to the wilds of Fodlan and avoiding any settlements.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, she would simply warp away, vanishing through the dark and arriving in a random place, seemingly just to test her limits. She wouldn’t answer any questions he had, though once, when she traveled to the mountains called Fodlan’s Throat, she stared out into the distance, towards the lands called Almyra.</p><p> </p><p>“...” She sat down and stared for a stretch of time, taking in the distant prairies and desert. “...their castles look different.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of c–”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut the fuck up.” She continued to stare, then let out a slow sigh. “...Someday, I’m gonna go over there. Not sure what I’ll find when I do, but I’m gonna.”</p><p> </p><p>“You would abandon–”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off.” Then she pushed herself up, and started to travel again, returning back through the Kingdom and slaughtering a squad of Tempest Knights along the way. </p><p> </p><p>There was no delight in her actions, just a cold rage. She wasted no time, every strike was meant to kill or cripple, and the latter was only so she could finish them as quickly as possible before she returned to her travels.</p><p> </p><p>He wondered what she was looking for, but he knew better than to ask. He wondered if she even knew what she wanted. </p><p> </p><p>One day, he saw the first moment of vulnerability he had seen in months. Traveling though the Kingdom, Shez had bundled herself up, keeping quiet as she did her best to ignore the cold. She was low on supplies, so she didn't want to risk a fire which might attack unwanted attention. </p><p> </p><p>So when the voices drifted close, she couldn't help but stiffen at who spoke. </p><p> </p><p>"...on Dimitri, you have…isn't that right?" She heard Sylvain, his tone still jovial despite it all. </p><p> </p><p>"Shut up!" Ingrid retorted, chiding her friend. “...can’t just suggest–”</p><p> </p><p>“...just teasing…”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez took a slow, shaky breath. Epimenides watched as she plainly considered going over to her former classmates. It would be her first positive human contact in a long time.</p><p> </p><p>That was why Epimenides floated closer, speaking softly. “I will not impede you.”</p><p> </p><p>“…”</p><p> </p><p>“You wish to go to your friends, do you not? I swear, I shall stay out of your way. I shall not harm them.” It was a necessary kindness if he wanted his vessel to finally stop resisting him.</p><p> </p><p>Then she warped away, and Epimenides paused at realizing they were now in a field far from the forest Shez had hidden in. “What–Why would you do that?! You had a chance to reunite–“</p><p> </p><p>“Why would <em> you </em> want me to reunite with my friends?” she asked, glaring up at him.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t–I swore to you that I wouldn’t–“</p><p> </p><p>“I. Don’t. Trust. You.” Each word was blunt and forceful, genuine anger on her face. “You lied to me for months <em> at least </em> ! You are not my friend, you’re just the piece of shit I need to tolerate until I can get rid of it. Because <em> I </em>am telling the truth when I say I’m going to fucking kill you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you truly wish to test me? Because I can–” </p><p> </p><p>In a moment, Shez shifted to her awakened form and glared up at the spirit, her arms spread wide. “Then do it.” </p><p> </p><p>“...What do you think you are doing?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m testing your bullshit. Control me. Do it.”</p><p> </p><p>The sage’s eyes narrowed. “Do not test me, vessel. The instant I seize control, I shall go back and slaughter those friends of–”</p><p> </p><p>“Do it. Do it, you piece of shit. Take control of me again. Rob me of my body, ruin my life…do whatever the fuck you can think of.” Her violet eyes burned orange as they locked with his. “You’ve had two years. You can’t tell me you didn’t have anything you wanted to do.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hmph. My greatest foe is slain. I have no reason–”</p><p> </p><p>“Then why are you still here? Why? You got what you wanted, right? Except, not really. There aren’t any parades for Epimenides. You went right in front of ‘our’ people and they wanted to kill us. They didn’t give a shit. And none of them came looking for us.” She let her arms drop. “None of them care about you. They only wanted the power you had.”</p><p> </p><p>“As though you care. You intend to see my name lost–”</p><p> </p><p>“Your name was already lost. Nobody nowadays knows who ‘Epimenides the sage’ is. And why would they? You’re just some guy that died ages ago. You never did anything important, and the world doesn’t know who you are.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am responsible for–!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah yeah, you invented magic and mutilated corpses, wow, so special.” She rolled her eyes, making him scowl. “Nobody knows what you did. Other people took credit for the stuff you did and it doesn’t matter that you ‘won’. Nobody even knew Byleth had the goddess in her. All you did was hurt my sister. And I’m never going to forgive you for that.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I do not want your forgiveness,” the sage muttered, his voice bitter as he looked away from his vessel.</p><p> </p><p>“Then get on with it. Possess me.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides scowled, turning back to his vessel. “Why do you desire such a thing from me? You claim I robbed you of your body–”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t say that,” Shez ordered, anger audible in her voice, “Don’t say ‘claimed’ when you know what you did. You want to talk about how bad you have it? You stole my fucking body and used me to hurt the people I care about!”</p><p> </p><p>“I did not!” Epimenides retorted, “I stayed my hand! I did not strike down any of your friends! All I did was state the truth to them–”</p><p> </p><p>“FUCK YOU! You just said whatever would hurt and confuse people the most!”</p><p> </p><p>“I told the truth! That they live in a world based on lies is no fault of mine–”</p><p> </p><p>“Bullshit! You can’t say you made the relics and then act like you’re not responsible for how things turned out! You don’t get to say that!”</p><p> </p><p>He grimaced. “You said it yourself, my name is lost to history. Others took credit for my achievements. Therefore, by your rationale, I am absolved.”</p><p> </p><p>“...ha. You’re a fucking monster.”</p><p> </p><p>He’d heard it from her before. Yet this time…he let the pain fade. The word meant nothing to him. “I am an ordinary man who took a stand against the beast that destroyed the world. Nothing more.”</p><p> </p><p>And Shez laughed. “You really wish that was true, huh? You really want to be a hero. The regular guy with a fancy sword in hand that took a stand against an evil dragon and saved the day. But you’re not. The world went on without you." </p><p> </p><p>"...I was a doctor." </p><p> </p><p>Shez raised an eyebrow. She didn’t say a thing to him.</p><p> </p><p>"The lands of Agartha were wealthy, and prosperous," Epimenides continued, "Even if the Fell Star gave us the tools to do so, we were the ones who made ourselves great. Everything we achieved was because of our own hands." </p><p> </p><p>No response. Just more staring.</p><p> </p><p>"There were those who wanted more. Rallied under Thales and those like him, they rose up against her, wanting to take what they thought they deserved. I had nothing to do with that conflict. I was simply a doctor, tending to those in need far from the war. At the time, I prayed that everyone would remain safe. The Fell Star did not care. Even though we had nothing to do with the conflict, we were punished." </p><p> </p><p>“...You’re so full of shit.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides stiffened, then glared at her. “I am not–”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know if you noticed, but I have dreams about your life, asshole. All I’ve ever seen is you being a smug piece of shit as you try to kill Seiros and her saints. I don’t see ‘Epimenides the doctor’ or whatever the <em> fuck </em> you think you can say that’ll make me sympathize with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would I lie?!”</p><p> </p><p>She scoffed. “Don’t give me that. You’d lie to make yourself look better and Sothis worse. The only reason you’re telling me anything now is because you want to convince me you were right all along. For all I know, you led the charge and Thales was the poor, simple doctor who didn’t want anything to do with what happened.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides grimaced. “If nothing else, Shez, I implore you to believe that Thales was not a mere civilian caught up in a fight he did not want. The man was a, ugh, <em> senator </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, I don’t know what that is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Think of a noble but with the pretense of being chosen by the people.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…so like a mayor?”</p><p> </p><p>“Infinitely worse than that, but it is an adequate comparison for your point of reference.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…Yeah, well…what about all that stuff you said in the fight? About how you’re the ‘guardian of the world’?”</p><p> </p><p>“The Agarthan people are the guardians of this world. We maintained the cycle of…” He sighed, his usual haughty loftiness fading. “...yet the world continued without us. The world did not wait for my return, the land had changed. And here I am, stuck to a fool who thinks eating toxic mushrooms will make her stronger." </p><p> </p><p>“Go fuck yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides paused, not expecting the sheer venom in his vessel’s voice. “...I intended that as a joke–”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? And what the hell gives you the right to joke with me?” she asked, the anger in her voice returning, “We’re not friends. You’re the asshole who pretended to be my friend. You want to make things right? Go away. Give back Arval then do everyone else a favor and die, for real this time.”</p><p> </p><p>"I am Arval–" </p><p> </p><p>"No, you're not. Arval was a dick sometimes, but they were still my friend! They cared about me and Byleth! They're the one who pushed me to talk to Byleth after she almost died against Catherine!!" She glared straight at Epimenides. “So I don’t care who you are, <em> Epi </em>. To me, you’re just the prick that pretended to be my friend. That’s all you’re ever going to be.”</p><p> </p><p>“...One day, you will under–”</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t. You could tell me every detail of your life and I’m not going to understand why you decided to lie to me in the first place. I’m not going to understand you, I’m not going to like you, and I’m not going to forgive you. That should be obvious at this point.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides stared back at her, before looking away first. Words failed him as he wilted under her glare, a throbbing in the back of his head. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry, partner," a voice not unlike his own said, one far softer than the Agarthan man ever spoke with. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Shez stared up at the spirit, her eyes going wide while Epimendies went rigid. “What was that?”</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing! It was nothing!" Epimenides shouted, trying to ignore the odd sensation in his body. </p><p> </p><p>"...Haha, Arval really is still alive in you, huh?" Shez murmured, her voice low, rubbing away the tears in her eyes. "Guess that's just someone else I have to save from you."</p><p> </p><p>“...You…You are a fool. And I will stop you from ruining…” He closed his eyes and shook his head. “Speaking to you is pointless.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right back at you, Epi.” Shez pushed herself up, brushing some dirt from her clothes. “Just know, I’m waiting for the next time you try to take my body from me. I know I can push you out. And when I do…you’re going to know you can’t <em> ever </em> do that to me again.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides didn’t have a response to that. All he could do was watch, quietly, as his vessel began a new trek towards the distant horizon. Not once did she spare a look back at him.</p><hr /><p>
  <em> It was by mortal hands that the world burned, scorched and sundered by the monstrous weapons of war they brought to bear. And it was by divine hands that their flames were smothered, the pillars of light that consumed their nations washed away beneath a deluge of divine recompense. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Yet the antediluvian Agarthans felt naught but contempt for the victor in their war. Spite drove them beneath the earth, determined to live away from the light brought by the divine star.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> And so, they abandoned their Sun…and gladly dwelt in Darkness. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Shez shined like sunlight. Even when she didn’t call on the power within her, the top of her hair burned a mix of red and orange that bled into trails of pink and purple, akin to a twilight sky. Her eyes would oscillate between orange and purple, often shifting with her mood, and she wielded the blade of Epimenides without reservation as she continued her bloody work.</p><p> </p><p>Thus a Demon became an Asura, her blades now stained with the blood of over a thousand souls.</p><p> </p><p>It almost made the wraith that followed her proud.</p><p> </p><p>“…hey, Epi.”</p><p> </p><p>Epimenides paused, almost going stiff on reflex, before he looked down at his vessel, who was reading a journal claimed from one of her recent victims. She sat near the fort’s fireplace, reading by lantern light while the bloodied bodies of the soldiers that once occupied it cooled on the floor around her, the commander still impaled on their dining table by Shez’s Killing Edge, its blade stained a permanent crimson with the amount of lives it had taken. “…yes? What is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“What’s our home city called again? The place I was born in.”</p><p> </p><p>He blinked, genuinely surprised by the question. “…Shambhala. Our home is called Shambhala. It is where the majority of our people fled to survive the Fell Star’s retribution.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, okay. It’s in Hrym, isn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>“…what?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s in Hrym. The old territory, not the new nation. It’s gotta be.” There was a glint in her eye. Some sort of malicious drive. “It’s the only place that makes sense. It’s why they’re so invested in it, why they went after Ordelia…why I grew up in Ordelia. It was the closest place my mom could hide without risking everything.</p><p> </p><p>She chuckled. “That’s gotta be it…”</p><p> </p><p>“…and what do you intend to do with that information?” Epimenides asked, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t get to know that.” She sighed. “…it’s my best bet. I go there first, then…the new Archbishop, that Cornelia lady, she’s one of us too, huh? And I bet there’s another one pressing things in Almyra, putting them on the attack…alright. Alright. I know what I’m doing.</p><p> </p><p>Shez stood, nodding to herself. “First thing’s first, I get Byleth back.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you truly think the Fell Star still lives?” Epimenides questioned, his mind starting to race. If she was aiming to figure out where the Agarthan people were located and intending to enter Zahras…she had seen him cast the spell. Could she be–</p><p> </p><p>“Course I do. I know she’s alive. She has to be.” Shez took a breath, then grinned. “Hell, she has Rhea with her, doesn’t she? So odds are, those two are probably surviving together and getting along just fine!”</p><hr /><p>The screech of the Immaculate One echoed out through the void, before a roar of blue flame bathed a massive swathe of the rock floating in the darkness, illuminating the emptiness around them for a scant moment. Then Byleth punched the dragon in the face, snapping her jaw shut with a vicious uppercut.</p><p> </p><p>The Immaculate One snarled, lunging for the smaller woman, whose eyes glowed in the darkness. Her jaws snapped shut around empty air, the shadows in the void twisting and shifting with an emerald sheen as Byleth bent time in a space where it did not exist.</p><p> </p><p>The dragon paused, eyes searching the void as a low growl emanated from her throat–Then she felt a weight on her head and had about a second to react before Byleth punched her in the eye.</p><p> </p><p>“GYAAAH!” Her scream echoed loudly through the darkness, her heavy body stumbling as she shook her head, trying to buck off the young woman gripping onto her horns. She roared in pain and fury before flapping her wings, taking off into the black sky overhead.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth tightened her grip on the Immaculate One’s horns, clinging on for dear life as the dragon soared through the void, flying fast through everlasting darkness. She tried to retaliate, to start punching at the top of Rhea’s far too hard head, but her blows did nothing but annoy the enormous dragon, who promptly twisted in the air, spinning in an attempt to dislodge the pest grasping onto–</p><p> </p><p>And then she slammed straight into a rock she didn’t see floating in the void. Dust and stone flew out from the point of impact, before Rhea began to fall, prompting a triumphant shout from Byleth…right before she realized the dragon’s current position meant that she was actually going to land on top of Byleth when she crashed.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah–No no no no–”</p><p> </p><p>Alas, the void was not willing to bend to Byleth’s attempt to turn back time, and thus she and Rhea smashed heavily into the stone below, sending up a plume of dust into the uncaring darkness.</p><p> </p><p>A time later, both Nabateans managed to regain consciousness, whereupon a now much more human-looking Rhea immediately whirled on her younger counterpart.</p><p> </p><p>“YOU PUNCHED ME IN THE EYE!”</p><p> </p><p>“YOU TRIED TO BITE ME!”</p><p> </p><p>“THAT WAS INSTINCTUAL! YOU WERE THE ONE WHO HIT ME IN THE FACE IN THE FIRST PLACE!”</p><p> </p><p>“YOUR TORE MY LEGGINGS!”</p><p> </p><p>“IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!”</p><p> </p><p>“I CARE A LOT ABOUT THOSE LEGGINGS! I BOUGHT THEM MYSELF!”</p><p> </p><p>“THAT–Wait, really? How? Those look remarkably fancy for something you purchased on a mercenary salary.”</p><p> </p><p>“I made more money working as a mercenary than I did working for you!” Byleth snapped, "And Candace helped me talk Anna down to a cheaper price." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…really? That's actually rather impressive. I haven't had any personal dealing with any Anna for generations, but I understand how her family is." </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, you do?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well yes, her ancestor Ernest was a Nabatean." </p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth’s eyes narrowed, skepticism radiating from her gaze. “What.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“There was a Nabatean…named <em> Ernest. </em> Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well that was his human name, not his Nabatean name. His Nabatean name was the Avaricious One.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth opened her mouth. She thought for a few seconds. She sighed. “That makes more sense than I want it to.”</p><p> </p><p>"Good. Now, will you be apologizing?" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Byleth took in a deep breath, before tackling Rhea.</p><hr /><p> “And I don’t want to hear any shit to the contrary!” Shez stated, pointing straight at Epimenides, “I’m going to get my sister back, I’m going to fix Fodlan, and I’m going to kill every single asshole that gets in my way, <em> you included!” </em></p><p> </p><p>“...You’ve lost your mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez laughed. There wasn’t much humor in it. “If I have, you know whose fault it is. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going home.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going to do what–”</p><p> </p><p>And in an instant, Shez vanished back into the dark, ready to put her plan into action.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>In her time away from the monastery, Flayn had come to learn much of the world. Things weren't as simple as she had thought, though she should have realized that. She had been asleep for a millennia, so it was probably too much to expect things to stay the same.</p><p> </p><p>It was almost funny how the only thing that stayed the same was how the Agarthans were still around…</p><p> </p><p>Sighing, she pushed herself up and away from her small patch of flowers she was growing in the garden. The Palace of Enbarr had a lovely garden and Edelgard had been kind enough to allow her a space to attempt growing her own plants, so she did.</p><p> </p><p>…She didn’t have a lot to do otherwise. She was a Black Eagle, but classes had ended long ago and it was obvious Edelgard wasn’t sure what position Flayn should have in whatever plans she was making.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t think Edelgard disliked her, but it was hard to say the emperor fully trusted her. Even after the years outside the Academy where Edelgard opened up to everyone else from her original class, she seemed to keep Flayn at a…possibly unintended distance, in part because she plainly had issues with the crest system and church as a whole. It was impossible not to notice, especially since she was open about her distaste for both with everyone else.</p><p> </p><p>It made her wonder just how everything was going to turn out. It’d been almost three years since she last saw her father and news about what happened to the people of the church was as sparse as it was contradictory. If even half the rumors were true, Seteth had apparently become the leader of the remaining Central Church forces resisting the Kingdom’s authority while also eloping to Almyra with either Catherine or Alois, all of which Flayn found quite unlikely. Alois was married, after all, and Catherine had a very obvious crush on Lady Rhea–</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Hello Flayn, you’re looking thoughtful.”</p><p> </p><p>Flayn paused, then glanced up, a smile coming to her face as she spotted Linhardt. “Good morning, Linhardt! And, ah…yes, I suppose I do have a few thoughts on my mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“I would hope so. If you let your mind have no thoughts, you’ll wind up like Caspar.”</p><p> </p><p>She giggled at the comment, then stood and brushed down her pants. Being away from the monastery granted her an opportunity to try out some new clothes and she found she quite enjoyed fashion suited for commonfolk. The poofy blue pants she wore were very easy to move around in and suited her linen shirt quite nicely. Add in a bandana to protect her hair and gloves for her hands, and she matched the image of a common gardener very well! Though she still needed to keep her ears covered; people might ask questions if they noticed they were pointed.</p><p> </p><p>Funnily enough, her choice to dress as a common gardener did cause some nobles to assume she was a common gardener, which was amusing until one noblewoman had been very rude to her as a result. Some nobility could be very unpleasant…</p><p> </p><p>She shook off that thought and glanced at Linhardt. “So are you planning to spend some time in the garden?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, it’s pleasant out here. Besides, I should be able to hide from Edelgard and my father here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Why would you be hiding from your father?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, he just has that air like he wants to make me do something. Honestly, you'd think his injuries would have gotten him to loosen up, but if anything he's still as stringent. Either way, I’d prefer not to get involved until Edelgard forces me, so I’m going to nap out here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I see…Hm.” Flayn frowned to herself. If Edelgard was planning something big, shouldn’t she be involved? She was part of the Eagles too, Edelgard was her friend, and the Adrestians had always been good to her…She nodded, resolved. “Thank you, Linhardt! I am going to speak to Edelgard now!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Uh…what did I do?”</p><p> </p><p>But Linhardt wouldn’t get an answer as Flayn hurried off to find the emperor. It was a bit tricky to find her, of course, the Palace of Enbarr was by far one of the largest buildings in all of Fodlan, and if she wasn't in her office then who knows where–</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, careful,” Marianne warned, steadying Flayn when the young Nabatean nearly ran into her, “Flayn? What are you doing running around the castle?”</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, hello Marianne, I was just looking for Lady Edelgard," Flayn said, smiling at the noble. She had to admit, it felt nice seeing the girl looking much healthier these days compared to her days at the monastery. Though as she looked up at Marianne, she noticed a letter in the noble’s hands. "Oh, my apologies, did I interrupt you reading something important?" </p><p> </p><p>"...Something like that. I, um…received a letter from my adoptive father." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh. Oh that's wonderful!" Flayn said, ignoring the pang she felt as she thought of her own father. "How is he?" </p><p> </p><p>"He didn't say. He…just wants me to return to the Alliance. I didn't know he had been searching for me all this time." </p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Oh, I see, that is…” She gave Marianne a curious look. “Good?”</p><p> </p><p>"I'm…not sure. I don't have a close relationship with my adoptive father. He only adopted me because of my crest and… I don't know what exactly he plans for me if I return." </p><p> </p><p>"So…you don't plan on doing so?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not right away, at least. I don't want to leave everyone here when they're still dealing with the war. And…we're still searching for the professor." </p><p> </p><p>"...That is true," Flayn said, refraining from saying the professor wasn't the only one she was hoping to see. Her father was still missing as well, and…well, even if there were issues with Lady Rhea, she wanted to find her too. “Ah, have you heard anything?”</p><p> </p><p>“Unfortunately I haven’t. Sorry. General Jeralt went out on another search mission recently though, so perhaps he’ll be able to bring back good news,” Marianne suggested, which earned a smile from Flayn. While the news wasn’t exactly good, at least the usually morose girl was more positive these days.</p><p> </p><p>"Well hopefully he returns soon," Flayn said, nodding before remembering where she was going. "My apologies, but I need to go talk with Lady Edelgard." </p><p> </p><p>"Take care." With a wave, Flayn took off, searching for her former house leader again. Though it was still quite confusing trying to navigate the castle. If only they put up signs to show where everything was… </p><p> </p><p>Before she could figure out where she was however, a door next to her suddenly blasted open, getting completely broken off its hinges. </p><p> </p><p>"Fascinating!" She heard Constance shout out, followed by a groan from someone else. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Coco, I think Momo might need a nap." Came Hapi's voice as something slumped over. Feeling very curious, Flayn peaked her head in to see the aforementioned two, alongside Monica, who was slumped over a desk, and Hubert who was reading over a stack of papers, despite the room looking very disheveled from the sudden explosion. </p><p> </p><p>"So they've made artificial relics to act as amplifiers. Though it seems the drawbacks can be far more sudden than regular relic weapons. Perhaps there are ways to compensate for it,” Hubert mused, his eye twitching for a moment at the damages, before looking back down at the documents. “We know from Lady Edelgard’s report that using one of these allowed an Agarthan general to use Aymr with no apparent issues…though we might wish to wait when it comes to testing that. Particularly if a regular amplifier is so volatile.”</p><p> </p><p>"D-Do you think this is what helped cause the meteor swarm?" Monica asked, pushing herself up slightly, letting Flayn see the pseudo relic on her hand. She couldn't help but stiffen at the sight. Relic weapons were already an atrocity to her, but to see these black, bone-like mimics…she couldn't help but shiver slightly. </p><p> </p><p>"Perhaps? Though they must have used a much stronger version, or perhaps multiple of these to make something devastating…though in either case, they likely weren't able to use it multiple times since they only launched the one attack," Constance muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"Or maybe the person who casted it just died if we're lucky," Hapi said with a shrug, before noticing Flayn. “Oh, hey Flay. What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I was just looking for Edelgard, but then the door exploded,” she explained, gesturing to the wrecked door in question.</p><p> </p><p>“Lady Edelgard should be referred to with proper honorifics,” Hubert chided, giving her an annoyed look, “She is the emperor, if you would recall.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I recall,” Flayn replied, resisting the urge to roll her eyes. Hubert could be as nagging as her father sometimes…and that thought made her sad so she wasn’t going to focus on that. “So what are you doing?</p><p> </p><p>"Merely testing something we acquired from our shadowy enemies." He smirked. “They may not have parted with it willingly, but we’ve put their failures to good use.”</p><p> </p><p>”Hm. Are you sure it should be used? Relic weapons are…very volatile, even under the best circumstances,” she pointed out, more than a little disturbed by the artificial bones of the false relic.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, it does seem like it can be very dangerous. Still, at least we know just how dangerous it is," Hapi commented.</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly! In fact, we should take steps to see just how dangerous these artifacts can be!” Constance declared, “Multiple experiments are needed with multiple subjects–”</p><p> </p><p>“We need them to volunteer, Coco. And let’s try to keep things ethical, alright?”</p><p> </p><p>“I am certain we can acquire some bandits and a few soldiers that are more criminal than dutiful,” Hubert mentioned, which earned a frown from Hapi.</p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, let’s not get into the human experimenting business. Not a fan of that.”</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, right, of course, my apologies." Surprisingly, Constance actually sounded apologetic. </p><p> </p><p>"I-I can still help…" Monica said, still looking exhausted. </p><p> </p><p>“No, that’s quite alright. I think we had better put an end to the experimentation for now,” Hubert decided, “We’ve established what these artificial relics are likely meant for and how they are used, which is a good starting point.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, though a starting point is merely the beginning!” Constance declared.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, that is what ‘starting point’ means.”</p><p> </p><p>"Right, well, I'll leave you all to it," Flayn said, giving them a smile before she left. Better she leave the magical research to people who were experienced with it. Now if only they could build a magic tool so she wouldn't get lost… </p><p> </p><p>Regardless, she continued to walk, only to get nearly trampled over as a trio rushed past a corner. "Woah!" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, sorry Flayn, didn't see you there! Just in a bit of a rush!" Caspar apologized, the once short boy having had quite the growth spurt as he glanced down at her. </p><p> </p><p>"Y-Yeah, sorry! We just wanted to make sure we greeted Petra when she arrived!" Bernadetta explained, the archer also having a growth spurt of her own, even if she wasn't as bulky as Caspar in his armor. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, is Petra back already?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not yet!" Ferdinand spoke up. "But we need to prepare a welcoming party for her, and you are more than welcome to join if you are not busy." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I would love to! I can get some of the flowers from my garden to help spruce up the venue!" She paused. “Oh, wait, I was going to visit Edelgard, actually. Um, right, let me do that first, then I can–Oh right, do you know where Edelgard is at the moment?”</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, I believe she went to the training ground earlier, she wanted to see how the soldiers were doing before Captain Jeralt returned,” Ferdinand explained, before smiling. "Would you like me to guide you?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yes, please," Flayn replied, smiling up at the nobleman. </p><p> </p><p>"Then guide I shall! Bernadetta, Caspar, my apologies but I'll be joining you two later!" Ferdinand declared, waving their friends off before the two walked off together. "How have you been, Flayn?" </p><p> </p><p>"Excellent, I think. I'm hopeful that Captain Jeralt will have some good news for us once he returns."</p><p> </p><p>"Hopefully. If nothing else, I hope he was able to figure out who the mysterious soldier that's been attacking the principality is," Ferdinand muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“...do you think it could be…”</p><p> </p><p>“Professor Byleth? Or Shez? It could be, though I am uncertain. It might be related to those ‘Reclaimer Knights’ that have been causing trouble for the principality.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Has Edelgard decided what to do about them yet?” Flayn asked with a small frown. She didn’t know what to make of the knights that declared themselves to be fighting on behalf of the goddess. She knew they were apparently made up of former Knights of Seiros and defecting Knights of Faerghus, but they’d been staying out of much of the conflict, to the point that it wasn’t clear where their loyalties were meant to lie. Add in the rumors that her father was involved with them that she wasn’t sure she believed…</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to think that if her father was in charge of the remaining church forces, he would have come to support her in the Empire. If he hadn’t…it just didn’t match her idea of her frankly overprotective father, and that worried her. </p><p> </p><p>“Officially, no, though they have been a topic of conversation,” Ferdinand explained, frowning thoughtfully, “I know Hubert has been looking into them for some time now, but they’re a reclusive group. The fact that they don’t follow standard church doctrine is cause for concern, especially since the Northern Church has been using their ‘Reformation’ to proclaim themselves the true faith…”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm. Um…has Edelgard given my proposal any thought?” Flayn asked, the current conversation reminding her of an idea she’d had before.</p><p> </p><p>“She has, you don’t need to worry about that. Honestly, I think restarting the Southern Church is an excellent idea! Without the Central Church to keep balance, the faithful of the Empire need somewhere to turn!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, exactly! Even if it's not on the same level as the Central Church, it can still help the people greatly!" Flayn said, a smile on her face. </p><p> </p><p>As the two talked, they soon arrived in the training grounds of the castle, where a group of soldiers were going through some sparring practice. They seemed to be handling themselves well, though it was hard to tell if the Emperor watching over them was pleased or not. </p><p> </p><p>Flayn had to admit, despite only being slightly taller than her, Edelgard always seemed to tower over those around her and she couldn't help but envy that confidence. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, Edelgard there you are!" Ferdinand called out, getting the Emperor's attention. </p><p> </p><p>"Ferdinand? Did you need something?" </p><p> </p><p>"Not me, Flayn wished to speak with you, if you're not busy." </p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Ladislava, handle the drills for now,” Edelgard commanded, earning an immediate salute from the bodyguard-turned-general. </p><p> </p><p>“Of course, your majesty.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, allow me to assist!” Ferdinand immediately offered, going right along with her with his usual enthusiasm and aplomb.</p><p> </p><p>And with that settled, Edelgard turned towards Flayn. “What did you require?”</p><p> </p><p>The young Nabatean paused, trying to collect her thoughts. “Ah…well, I had an initial request, which was to know what your new plans were, but, ah, then I was reminded of my other proposal, which was to reestablish the Southern Church, and, ah…my apologies, I am rambling…”</p><p> </p><p>“I did give your proposal a good deal of thought, Flayn, and I think it is a good idea.”</p><p> </p><p>It took a moment for Edelgard’s words to register, then Flayn immediately smiled. “O-Oh! I am glad to hear that! Er, so, is the Southern Church going to be reestablished?”</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed, I plan to have it built back up soon, though there are a few issues to take care of before we can fully make the project work. For instance, we’ll need a bishop.” </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, of course. I…am aware there was a count in charge of religious affairs who passed away, so I imagine you'll need to find someone suited for the role." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, and on that matter, who would you nominate for the role?" </p><p> </p><p>"W-Wait, you want me to choose?" </p><p> </p><p>"At the very least I want to hear who you think would be well suited for the position. This is your proposal, is it not?" Edelgard asked, staring at Flayn with a calculating eye. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, uh…" Flayn paused, trying to think of who would be good for the position. "...Someone like Professor Byleth?" </p><p> </p><p>“…hm. I doubt there are many people like Professor Byleth.” Edelgard gave her a curious look. “I would have thought you’d suggest someone more like Rhea.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Oh, yeah…ah, well, while Lady Rhea was the Archbishop for a very long time, I, er…” She looked around for a moment, hoping no one was listening in, before leaning towards Edelgard and speaking in a low voice. “I’m not sure she was very good at it…”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s lips twitched. “I must admit, I am surprised you would say that. Aren’t you one of Rhea’s supporters?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Um…I guess? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I support Lady Rhea! I just…there were a lot of problems at the monastery? And I…um…I guess it was kind of…disillusioning?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. How long were you at the monastery?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, um…well, I actually joined the same year you and the others did. Before that, I lived away from the monastery.” She huffed. “I actually had to beg my father to let me go there…um, so, yes, I hadn’t actually seen what Lady Rhea was like as the archbishop before then and…well I know she tried her best! I just think, maybe, we need somebody, um…less distant? Maybe? I’m not sure if I’m articulating this well…”</p><p> </p><p>"Well, I understand what you mean if nothing else," Edelgard stated, as she thought about what to say. "And what about someone like your father?" </p><p> </p><p>"Ah…" Flayn frowned. "Don't get me wrong, I love my father but…well, while he might be more personable, he also tends to keep out of others’ business as well. I didn't even know about all the troubles Fodlan was facing because he never told me…and I didn't even bother to learn. I spent so long trying to figure out how to socialize with everyone, I didn't bother to learn what they were going through." </p><p> </p><p>“Hm. And now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Now…Now I want to try to make things better. And I think starting up the Southern Church could do that…maybe…no, not maybe, I know it will help!”</p><p> </p><p>That earned a small smile from Edelgard. “I see you have your convictions. Well, we will have to discuss the matter of the bishop further, along with some other issues. After seeing what became of the Western and Central churches, I would prefer it if the Southern Church remained more of a spiritual organization without a focus on governance or military.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so more like the Eastern Church then? I think that works perfectly then! The church should be there to support people, not fight them!” Flayn stated, surprising Edelgard at the support. </p><p> </p><p>"...If I am being honest, part of the reason I'm so open to the idea of reopening the Southern Church is because I had plans for that in the past. However, I had all but abandoned them after everything that occurred," Edelgard admitted. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh…well, I can understand why. I mean, without someone to grant it legitimacy, some might take offense to it. Even so, I'm sure you'll make it work!" </p><p> </p><p>"...Hm. If I were to admit something else, there are other secrets that I am keeping, much like I'm sure you are." </p><p> </p><p>“Eh? A-Ah, I-I mean, uh, w-what do you mean? I-I have no secrets to keep at all, ahahaha…” Flayn said, weakly defending herself under Edelgard’s stare. "...Maybe we should go to your office if we're going to discuss such things." </p><p> </p><p>“Would you be willing to discuss such things?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I would, yes. I…want to be honest with my friends, so yes, I am willing to tell you the truth.”</p><p> </p><p>“Very well, then we can go to my office,” Edelgard said, saying the last bit loud enough for Ladislava to hear, who nodded in return as the Emperor walked away. Despite how nervous she felt, Flayn followed along. Preparing herself for what’s to come. Soon enough the two were in the imperial office. In the moment, Flayn mostly felt thankful that Edelgard was so used to the halls of the palace. </p><p> </p><p>“So…um, how is Dorothea? I, uh, haven’t seen her today,” Flayn asked, sitting across from Edelgard, unsure of how to start. </p><p> </p><p>“She is well. She seems to be helping some of the others prepare for Petra’s arrival,” Edelgard said, keeping her tone even. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s good to hear…” Flayn took a breath, trying to settle her nerves. “...I would like to be honest with you, Emperor Edelgard. I…believe you may know a number of things already about my situation, though I am unsure of how much. In all honesty, you might even know more than me.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard simply raised an eyebrow, her hands folded in front of her. “And what would you like to be honest with me about?”</p><p> </p><p>“To begin with, Flayn is not my original name.” She untied her bandana and brushed her hair aside, showing a pointed ear. “I was once known as Cethleann, though that is only one of my names. Seteth is not my brother, he is my father, though that was never a very well hidden secret, and we were both once known as ‘saints’, though I do not really know if our actions warranted that title. I am a Nabatean, and my name is the Benevolent One.”</p><p> </p><p>The entire time she spoke, she watched Edelgard. And she had to admit, she was impressed; not once had the emperor reacted as though anything Flayn was saying was new information to her. Perhaps none of it was. </p><p> </p><p>Either way, if it was or wasn’t, the emperor maintained that same calm, focused look to her, listening intently and showing nothing in turn. “You claim to be Saint Cethleann then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I do, because I am. I was born over a thousand years ago to the Hammer of Judgment, whose name among humankind was Cichol, and Carmun, who was my mother. We lived apart from the city of Zanados, which was why we survived when the forces of Nemesis and his Eleven Elites massacred the Nabateans.” She kept her gaze steady and her voice even, though it wavered slightly when she mentioned her mother’s name. Even with how long it had been, the wound of her passing was still there. “...I realize I am…what I am saying may sound like nonsense without context, but I am trying to start from as far back as I can. I…Is there anything in particular you wish to ask me? I can give proof, if you want, like the location of my mother’s grave or stories from back then.”</p><p> </p><p>"...The Benevolent One and Hammer of Judgement sound more like titles than names." </p><p> </p><p>"In a sense, they're both. When we are born, Nabateans are simply called 'hatchlings' and it isn't until we reach a certain point of maturity that we 'earn' our names. I myself earned my name because I kept wanting to help all the humans I met." </p><p> </p><p>"...and the Immaculate One?" </p><p> </p><p>"She…Aunty Rhea was the youngest of the children of Sothis, she always stuck by her side, and in return Sothis favored her greatly. Though I suppose that led to her getting quite spoiled." Edelgard tried not to laugh at the thought of Rhea being a spoiled child. </p><p> </p><p>"So, just to be certain, you claim Rhea to be your aunt?" </p><p> </p><p>"That is also in a sense. I would say the title is more honorary. Rhea is…a direct child of the goddess, while my father and I are descended from her children, yet we all fought on the same battlefields and she cared for us as family. I like calling her Aunty Rhea more than Lady Rhea, because it makes us feel more like family, though it wasn’t unusual among the Nabateans to refer to those you are close to by familial terms. I might call you Sister Edelgard, for example.” She paused. “I-If that would be allowed, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard tried to ignore the odd feeling that went through her. “I see…at the moment, I would prefer being called Edelgard, if that is okay with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“O-Of course!”</p><p> </p><p>"For the sake of honesty, I fear I must apologize to you Flayn. I understand I have kept you at a distance but that is not from distaste. It comes more from a sense of…not knowing what to do." Edelgard paused as she considered her words. "At the start of the year, I never considered someone like you joining my class, and when you did I thought it would only be a matter of time for that bond to end, as it would be temporary at best. I am still uncertain where you stand, since as you say, you are one of the four saints." </p><p> </p><p>"...I can understand that. Truth be told, until recently, the church was all I knew. When I awoke from my slumber, it was just my father and I, but then he left to join the church. So I was alone again until I was allowed to join. So I was happy to join the church, it meant I could be with people again, I could have friends! Yes, my father told me things were dangerous, but it was always in terms of my blood or to stay away from people who were very forward…</p><p> </p><p>She frowned, letting some of her frustration show. “Truth be told, I am angry. At both my father and myself. He never told me about what happened to Fodlan and…I chose to live in ignorance. I never bothered to learn about the history of Fodlan, only the trends and such that the youths liked. The Insurrection, the Tragedy of Duscur, the Almyran invasions…There are so many tragedies in this land and I lived in ignorance."</p><p> </p><p>"We all live in ignorance until our eyes are forced open," Edelgard noted, her tone surprisingly sympathetic.</p><p> </p><p>“That is true…I still find it difficult to comprehend though. I went to sleep one day and when I awoke, the entire world was so very different and my past persona was lauded as a saint, of all things. Even though I’m pretty sure at least half of what they ascribe to me were actually actions my mother took,” Flayn muttered, allowing herself a small moment of bitterness at how history had forgotten someone she adored.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. History has a tendency to forget those who do not shake the world with their actions, tragic as it might be.” She sighed. “My own siblings are likely to be a footnote in my history, whenever and however it is written…it truly does not feel fair that those who impact our own lives so significantly are disregarded so completely.”</p><p> </p><p>“...hm…could I…know their names?” Flayn asked, wondering if she had gone too far with the question yet forging on anyway, “I do not know how long I will live, but I will make sure to carry those names with me…i-if it is alright with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard smiled. “I would be happy to tell you about them, though I fear my own memories won’t match up to the life they once had. In exchange…could you tell me about your mother?”</p><p> </p><p>Flayn returned her smile, brightly and openly. “I would love to.”</p><hr /><p>Jeralt was feeling his age. He’d been feeling his age for the past three years. Some days, it felt like he’d just collapse under the weight of all the years he’d lived, all of it pushing down on him at once until he was crushed beneath it all.</p><p> </p><p>The loss of his kids settled deep in his bones. It wasn’t quite despair, not yet; he’d never exactly hit that point. He’d seen other people hit in, breaking under the sheer weight of their sorrow. He couldn’t do that though. He didn’t know where they were…but he was positive his kids were out there. He’d find them, some day.</p><p> </p><p>If he didn’t…or if he did, and they were…That’s when he would stop. Just…stop.</p><p> </p><p>But that wasn’t something he let himself dwell on. Not while there was still a chance. Not while there was still work to do.</p><p> </p><p>The little emperor, Edelgard, had an intensity to her that reminded him of Rhea. The difference was, Rhea put that intensity towards keeping things the same. Edelgard wanted the world to change, and she’d bend things as far as they could go to make it happen. Maybe even break it, so it could be fixed up better.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth liked her, so that’s why he was willing to work for her instead of just running around all of Fodlan until he dropped, looking for any hint of where his kids went. And it’s what brought him out towards Garreg Mach. Not to the monastery itself though, but towards some of the lower valleys in the central Fodlan stretch of the Oghma Mountains. Specifically, towards the Red Canyon.</p><p> </p><p>“So hey, Captain, do you think it counts as heresy if we enter the canyon?” Victor asked, giving Jeralt a glance as the pair of them crouched by an outcropping, waiting for Candace to return from her scouting, “I mean, we don’t exactly have permission from the archbishop–”</p><p> </p><p>“Doesn’t really matter if no one’s around to enforce the rule, right?” Jeralt pointed out, “I doubt any knights are going to be bothered. Aside from the ones invading the canyon in the first place.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, that makes sense…speaking of, are we supposed to go after them? Because we kinda left the rest of the battalion waiting back thataway.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re just checking things out. If they cause problems, we’ll try to deal with it. If they seem like they can be reasoned with, we’ll talk to them. For now, we wait until Candace gets–”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey Captain! Guess who I found!” </p><p> </p><p><em> The goddess really does have a funny sense of timing, </em> Jeralt mused to himself, before he sighed and stood up from his cover to spot his lancer returning with…some kid he didn’t recognize. “Hey Candace. Who’s that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh? You don’t remember Cyril, captain?” Candace asked, looking confused, “You know, the little Almyran kid! Well, not so little now, but you know what I mean!”</p><p> </p><p>“So did you blow our cover or wh–Oh huh, that’s that Cyril kid,” Victor recognized as he peeked up to spot Candace and her companion, who apparently everyone but Jeralt remembered.</p><p> </p><p>"Right, hi there kid. What exactly are you doing here?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'm on guard duty." Cyril said, yanking his arm free from Candace. "What are you doing here?" </p><p> </p><p>"Recon." Jeralt gruffly responded as he eyed the kid. He looked a bit worse for wear, but didn't seem to be malnourished, at least. Wasn't letting go of his bow either, his free hand staying close to his quiver. Had an axe at his side too, probably as a back-up weapon. That or he was planning to be a woodcutter if this guard thing didn’t work out. “So, are you part of the group squatting in the canyon or what?”</p><p> </p><p>Cyril’s eyes narrowed. “What’s it to you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I was sent by Emperor Edelgard to check out what’s going on with a group of knights that took over one of Fodlan’s holy sites, so that’s what I’m doing. I’d prefer it if this doesn’t turn into a fight, kid, especially since you’re the one at a disadvantage here.”</p><p> </p><p>Cyril scowled. “I can still–”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, c’mon cap, you need to be nicer when you’re talking to kids!” Candace chided, before giving Cyril a pat on the head, which he moved away from, “Alright buddy, mind showing my friends to your group? We’re looking to negotiate, not fight.” She paused, then glanced at Jeralt. “Right?”</p><p> </p><p>The question wasn’t rhetorical, she’d clearly forgotten. “Yeah, we can negotiate. We’re not going to start a fight.”</p><p> </p><p>He’d sure as hell finish one if it came to that though.</p><p> </p><p>“...hm…yeah, alright,” Cyril decided, nodding, “I’ll take you there. Not like you could do much anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt decided not to point out that there was plenty he could do right now to make Cyril’s day unpleasant. Aside from that being a bad move in general, the kid was still a kid. He didn’t want that kind of blood on his hands if he could help it. </p><p> </p><p>And once he actually got a view of the canyon, he quickly realized that Cyril was absolutely right.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit,” Victor muttered, staring out at the golems standing guard around at the canyon. The massive stone constructs were completely still, almost like statues; Jeralt would’ve assumed they were if it weren’t for the fact that one of them turned its head towards them the instant they caught its attention.</p><p> </p><p>“Woah…that’s a lotta guys,” Candace remarked, her own attention on what was basically an army filling up the canyon. And it wasn’t as though they just had a camp down there; it looked like the “Knights of Reclamation” had built their own settlement, complete with fortified buildings, defenses, and wells for water. “How many are down there?”</p><p> </p><p>“At least a couple thousand,” Cyril stated, looking smug, “Think you three can measure up?”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh? Uh…well, we can’t really divide it up by a thousand if there’s just two thousand there, cause if we try to divide that with three of us, then we get a really weird number–”</p><p> </p><p>“It was rhetorical, Candace,” Jeralt pointed out, before letting out a sigh, “Alright, you made your point, kid. Can we speak to your boss now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, alright. Seteth will probably be happy to see you guys.”</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, Seteth looked more stressed than happy when he spotted Jeralt walking up to him, particularly since the former chamberlain seemed to be in the middle of arguing with a guy who looked a whole lot like the fishkeeper at Garreg Mach. </p><p> </p><p>“–genuinely don’t have enough supplies to work for a sustained campaign–Jeralt?” Seteth blinked, genuinely caught off guard when he noticed the former captain of the Knights of Seiros. Then Seteth immediately went over to him and clasped his hands to the former captain’s shoulders. “Thank the goddess you’re here, you have to help me with these people!”</p><p> </p><p>“...alright.” <em> That’s not a good sign. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Hey Bernhard,” Candace, meanwhile, greeted, waving at the fishkeeper, because apparently she just knew everyone.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, hello," the fishkeeper greeted in return. </p><p> </p><p>"So, what exactly is going on?" Jeralt asked, deciding to keep on track, something Seteth appreciated. </p><p> </p><p>"You've likely heard of them, but this is the camp of the Knights of Reclamation," Seteth stated, confirming who they were. "And it was decided that I would be the leader, given my previous qualifications.”</p><p> </p><p>“We named him the archbishop,” the fishkeeper, of all people, explained.</p><p> </p><p>“The <em> interim </em> archbishop, who is not the official–Look, never mind. I am the leader of these people for various reasons, all right? Now, the only problem with this position is that the knights here are apparently fully dedicated to starting an almost suicidal campaign." </p><p> </p><p>“Uh…what–”</p><p> </p><p>“Jeralt, I need you to understand, I have spent <em> three years </em> surrounded by religious zealots who want to invade <em> everyone </em> ,” Seteth stated, trying to keep a calm tone and very obviously failing, “They are utterly convinced that the goddess returned when Garreg Mach was invaded and declared…apparently a number of things. The point is, everyone who isn’t here, right now, is potentially a heretic and I think it might be my fault for holding them back so long but I couldn’t just let them die, now could I? They want to invade the Kingdom in retaliation and then the Hrym secession happened and they became the next target, then somehow it turned into a whole thing that the Alliance was also the problem because they broke away from the Empire, but also the <em> Empire </em> needs to be invaded because they turned away from the goddess’s light and I have no idea how they even get half the ideas they’ve come up with.”</p><p> </p><p>“...what.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey captain, they got a statue of your daughter over there for some reason,” Victor pointed out, catching Jeralt’s attention. And…yeah, that was pretty clearly a statue of Byleth, striking a triumphant pose with the Sword of the Creator pointed towards the sky and her foot on a demonic beast.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. They made her boobs huge,” Candace noted while Jeralt turned his gaze towards Seteth.</p><p> </p><p>“...<em> What </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Honestly, it’s one of their better attempts,” the fishkeeper commented, “We probably have a few still scattered around, along with those murals Luca helped paint–”</p><p> </p><p>“You, shut up,” Jeralt ordered, pointing at the fishkeeper, before turning his glare back towards Seteth. “What the hell is this about Byleth being worshipped by these lunatics?”</p><p> </p><p>Seteth winced at the insult, particularly when a few of the knights nearby paused and frowned at Jeralt. “...Essentially, the Knights of Reclamation have convinced themselves that your eldest is the goddess incarnate, because of the abilities she displayed that were beyond mortal means." </p><p> </p><p>“Well, she was openly speaking as the goddess,” the fishkeeper pointed out, “And her being was radiating divinity–”</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t I tell you to shut up?” Jeralt sighed irritably. “Right, what the hell is this?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well from the look of it, a bunch of Kingdom deserters and Church remnants decided to make a cult based around calling your daughter the new goddess,” Victor commented, before frowning in thought, “Or the reborn goddess?”</p><p> </p><p>“The latter,” the fishkeeper–</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you still talking?” Jeralt complained, “And I already got that part, Victor.”</p><p> </p><p>“So wait, if Byleth is their goddess, is Shez anything?” Candace asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Basically the opposite,” Cyril spoke up, “Something about the two of them fighting each other and talking about ancient peoples. Most people here are saying she’s a demon or a fallen goddess.”</p><p> </p><p>“I personally like ‘The Adversary’ as an epithet.”</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt glared at the fishkeeper. “...I’m going to punch you the next time you speak up.”</p><p> </p><p>Seteth gave Bernhard a look, making the fishkeeper back down before he could say anything. "Essentially, the Knights are remnants of the Knights of Seiros and Kingdom Soldiers who were at the monastery. I've managed to keep them in check for now, but I feel like it's only a matter of time before they go charging off at the first thing to set them off." </p><p> </p><p>"...Right. Well, if it makes you feel better, Flayn is doing alright," Jeralt said, unsure of what else to say. </p><p> </p><p>"...It does, yes. I was aware she was in Enbarr, and that the war hasn't hit it yet at least, so I assumed she was safe. Even so, knowing is better than assuming." </p><p> </p><p>"I can understand that," Jeralt muttered as he looked over the knights there. They seemed to be doing their best with maintaining their settlement, but there was definitely tension in the air. Lots of people with weapons and not much to do. Sighing, he rubbed the back of his head. "I can't promise anything, but if you come with me, I can get you a meeting with the Emperor." </p><p> </p><p>"And hey, the little Emperor is Byleth’s student, so when you think about it, if anything she's like super holy for you reclamation people!" Candace helpfully chimed in. </p><p> </p><p>“Huh, maybe we could use that–”</p><p> </p><p>Jeralt warned him. So while Bernhard slept the forced sleep of an idiot who wouldn’t shut up, Jeralt turned back to Seteth. “So what resources do you people even have? I’m not seeing any pegasi or wyverns.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Seteth decided to ignore the knocked out fishkeeper. “Yes, that…well, we’ve had a few issues with retaining mounts over the years. Demonic beasts certainly thinned the mounts we once had and many of them escaped into the wild without the stables to keep them in. Our trained flyers also suffered the most casualties of our forces back in the monastery invasion, so we haven’t been able to train people up again…” He sighed. </p><p> </p><p>"Then it definitely seems like you people need help," Victor pointed out. </p><p> </p><p>"We do. However, I don't think it would be wise to march these knights straight into the heart of the Empire. They’re not completely undisciplined, but with the chaos going on right now, I feel like they’re bound to get into a conflict with either the Imperial soldiers or the Principality’s forces…” He sighed again, frowning. “Those traitors are the main reason we’ve been stuck here for so long with how much of the Empire’s north eastern territory they’ve taken. Still, if I were to go alone, then who knows what these knights will get up to." </p><p> </p><p>"Then I can leave some of my men here," Jeralt offered, "We were only supposed to do some recon, so we don't have a surplus of supplies, but they can share some stuff and keep an eye on them while you and I go back." </p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, for sure!” Candace agreed, “I can definitely hang out with these weirdos! Byleth and Shez were like little sisters to me, so I can share all kinds of stories!” She paused, then glanced at Jeralt. “You’re not like a father to me, captain.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I don’t know why you felt the need to say that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted to make things clear between us.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Sure.” He decided to just ignore that. “So, you good to–”</p><p> </p><p>“Archbishop Seteth, I would like to report that–...why is Bernhard unconscious on the ground?” Some robed guy asked, looking concerned.</p><p> </p><p>“He fell asleep,” Jeralt stated.</p><p> </p><p>“...what? How in the world did–Wait, aren’t you the father of the goddess?”</p><p> </p><p>“And now I’m leaving. Come on, Seteth.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, wait, right now? Shouldn’t I hear the report–”</p><p> </p><p>“No. Come on.” </p><p> </p><p>“But–”</p><p> </p><p>“You want to see your daughter, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” He turned to the robed man. “Luca, you’re in charge.” Then he promptly followed after Jeralt.</p><p> </p><p>“...” After a moment, Victor glanced at the new guy. “So what were you reporting on anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, just that Pallardo’s back at the monastery again.”</p><p> </p><p>“...the merchant guy?”</p><p> </p><p>“He turned to banditry a while ago. Honestly, I’m not sure how he keeps showing up since he’s been reported killed at least five times.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Sounds immortal,” Candace remarked, “Maybe you could add him to your religion?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? We can’t just add people–...actually, hm…”</p><p> </p><p>“...Hey, wait up, I’m going with you guys!” Cyril called out, promptly hurrying after the two older men. Because honestly? Screw sticking around these weirdos.</p><p> </p><p>Why couldn’t they just worship Lady Rhea like normal people?</p>

  <p>
  <span>If there was one thing Shez had gotten better at over the years, it was keeping track of directions. On occasion she still might forget a thing or two, but when it came down to getting from her village to Castle Ordelia, she knew it better than the back of her hand. She’d repeated the path enough times that she’d practically created a new trail where her feet fell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, not really, since the castle was a ways away from the mountains she grew up in, but her own means of travel made it easy to get to a nice vantage point to check out the patrols. As usual, the place had some of those masked demonic beasts walking around outside, on patrol for any threats. There were flying beasts too up on the ramparts, the monstrous sentries overlooking the surrounding area like birds on the lookout for prey.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Twelve walkers, eight flyers,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Shez noted to herself, keeping a careful watch of her own, </span>
  <em>
    <span>That’s two more from last time…Guess they’ve been making more again.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t sure where “House Phlegethon” was getting more people to make into monsters, but she knew for a fact there were even more inside the castle. The demonic beasts were the Phlegethon's main way of keeping the Alliance’s forces back so it made sense they’d keep more in reserve. Those beasts were bound to be her biggest obstacle to getting inside…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She could fight them, but it would take too long, meaning it would alert everyone inside. And if she warped inside, then she'd be surrounded by a bunch of demonic beasts. It was a two part problem and one she was having trouble solving, especially since the castle was fully locked down. She hadn’t seen them even bring in supplies, which probably meant they had some way of getting it in without being spotted. Some kind of underground passages were most likely, but she hadn’t managed to find any of them despite her scouting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sighing, she considered her options, before looking at the beasts, trying to find an opening to flash past them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re not going to make it in, you know,” Epimenides murmured, which Shez ignored because he could go fuck himself. “You have no idea what you’re getting in–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Shez flashed straight up to the ramparts, letting herself land for a moment as two of the flyers looked the wrong way, before she went right into a shadow step, moving into the courtyard and letting herself drop down. Once her feet touched the ground again, she immediately moved, going straight for the castle proper while taking note of every beast lounging around. There were demonic beasts filling the courtyard, three walkers to be specific, so she kept moving, going to the first door she spotted. The hall she entered didn’t seem well kept, but it seemed more out of misuse than being trashed, so there probably wasn’t anyone nearby. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even if there was, she had to be careful on who she grabbed; if she didn’t grab an Agarthan, then her plan wouldn’t work. Which made it all the more annoying that she could only be sure who was who based on how pale they were. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Do Agarthans have different blood? That might make it easier to tell…</span>
  </em>
  <span> She let out a little sigh, before starting to explore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The further in she went, the cleaner the place started looking. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Not even Agarthans like living in filth, I guess.</span>
  </em>
  <span> The problem was, she didn’t know what the interior structure of this place was like. She’d seen it from the outside plenty, but she didn’t know what the inside looked like and she had no idea what the Agarthans were doing with the place…aside from knocking down some walls, apparently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She blinked, staring at the hole in what had clearly been a wall previously, before she noticed the wood supports set up to keep everything in place. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Renovations, maybe? Why are they opening up–</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fucking bullshit is what it is,” grumbled a weirdly familiar voice further in, sounding irritated and strangely raspy, “This place is a drain on our resources. We should focus on fortifying or destroying those damn bridges and leave this place to rot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We still have on-going projects here, Lady Bias,” another voice replied, her tone more stoic, “Lord Myson wishes to continue investing in the exploration of empowered Ladons. Project Khione could very well–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Giving those monsters ice breath isn’t going to win us the war. It’s just another stupid idea that idiot is insisting we try out because he thinks if he has enough projects set up, one of them is bound to work,” the first one said, grumbling all the while. "Oh sure, let's just try to empower these demonic beasts even more, it's not like they could ever go wild and cause a rampage in the middle of our base." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We do have security measures in place–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if I care about that!" Bias shouted, a slam ringing out as she seemingly hit something. "Sages, why did I agree to do this?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please, Lady Bias. I'm sure Lady Pittacus will appreciate all you did for her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't speak as if you knew her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not. I have simply been instructed to say such things by Lord Myson." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...fucking idiot.” A sigh sounded out, still with a strange rasp to it. “Not you, that moron we call a leader.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I appreciate the lack of insults directed towards me. I will have to report your–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you say anything about reporting my ‘insubordination’, I’m going to kill you regardless of the consequences.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I understand these parameters. Still, I should note–” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just stop talking. I need some air.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, Shez probably wasn’t going to get a better chance than this. And besides, she owed Bias for smacking her that one time anyway. So the instant the gremory got close, Shez darted out from her hiding place and–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Immediately dodged straight back, her eyes going wide at the wall of flames that erupted between her and Bias. “Fucking rats got in again–...hang on. I know you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I know you t–” Shez was about to retort before she stiffened, staring at the Agarthan sage, who the years plainly hadn’t been kind too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? You looked surprised, brat.” Bias grinned, showing off how half her face and a good amount of her upper body was covered in burn scars. The rest of her body was hidden beneath a black gown lined with fiery patterns, but Shez could see metal bracers on her arms with red stones implanted in them. Same with a choker around her neck and a diadem around her forehead, her dark hair bound back and looking redder than before. “Did you expect me to still be pretty?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not really. Looks more like your outside is starting to match your inside,” Shez replied, drawing her swords.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Arrogant little shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sadistic hag," Shez shot back, before dodging to the side as a fireball was launched at her. Landing on her feet, Shez dashed forward, bracing herself as she went through a wall of fire Bias cast, before attempting to slash through her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What is it with you two freaks being so suicidal?" Bias snarled as Shez’s blade clashed against a magic barrier, causing it to crack. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not the one who's going to die tonight," Shez responded, jumping back as she heard footsteps rapidly approaching. A glance to the side showed guys in black armor. Possibly more Agarthans, so she debated grabbing one–Then one extended some kind of fancy spear and it launched a lightning bolt at her, so that wasn’t great.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She still dodged it, though then she had to avoid another fireball–then a lot of fireballs, launching from Bias’s hand–Or, more accurately, from a larger ball of fire she was conjuring in front of her and then launching pieces of at Shez–And then there was a bolt of ice launched from the blonde lady in a brown noblewoman’s gown–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then her eyes went wide when the fire orb Bias conjured abruptly expanded, before bursting apart and fully bathing the entire hall in–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Shez took a slow breath, feeling her heart racing rapidly in her chest as she stood in the cold night air again, the heat on her body leaving her unpleasantly warm despite the chill. She let herself sit down for a moment, her body trembling slightly from the adrenaline coursing through her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...been a while since I’ve had to take on someone actually dangerous,” she murmured to herself, recapping the details of the fight in her mind as she tried to figure out just how dangerous Bias was going to be. </span>
  <em>
    <span>The fact that she noticed me so quickly was what screwed me over. Maybe I should just go for the kill on her and then grab one of the shittier ones…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You truly are insane.” And she immediately felt her mood plummet when the asshole spoke up. “What was that stunt meant to accomplish? Now your foes are aware–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh so now they’re ‘foes’. What happened to being a big happy Agarthan community?” she complained, frowning up at the prick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Epimenides glared back. “You know as well as I that the current crop of sages are threats to us–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, whatever, shut up. Though I’d gotten good enough to take those pieces of shit on…though, then again, that bitch clearly wasn’t resting on her laurels…fuck, this is going to be a pain…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then abandon this foolhardy plan of yours and–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut the fuck up. I’m not abandoning anything. The next Agarthan I see? I’m going to rip their fucking heart out,” Shez stated, before stating to travel back to her house. It took a bit of travel, but it didn’t matter. Her home was far enough away that Bias and whatever pricks she worked with wouldn’t be able to follow her, and once she got there, she could put the new info she got to work in her notes. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Besides, now that they know I’m there, they’re going to step up security. That means they’re bound to bring in even more Agarthans, and then I can grab one of those assholes to experiment with. Might not even have to fight that Bias bitch…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She did want to kill her. If she had the opportunity, she’d go for it, but killing Bias wasn’t a priority. Getting Byleth back was, and for that to happen, she just needed an Agarthan heart. From there…well, she knew how Epimenides cast it. She’d been right in there with him when he did, and she sure as hell remembered that moment with perfect clarity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let out a small breath once she arrived at her home, her boots touching down on the wood as she just warped inside. She might need to clean up the dirt later, but for now, she needed to note down everything she–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then a knock at the door caught her attention and she let out a frustrated sigh. “Seriously? Right now? It’s the middle of the night, can’t it fucking wait…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She lit some lanterns first, letting the light illuminate her home so she could see better–Though, honestly, her night vision was weirdly good these days; not perfect, but she was definitely better at seeing in the dark–and went over to the door with one in hand so she could talk to the dickhead elder that kept trying to kick her out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I told you already, this is my mom’s house and I’m not–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez stared at Kronya. The Agarthan stared back, looking alarmed and bewildered, her eyes wide. </span>
  <em>
    <span>…oh, her hair got longer.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are you doing here!?" Shez’s eyes glanced to the side, finding Lysithea standing next to Kronya. </span>
  <em>
    <span>She's taller now…</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez felt her mouth dry, unable to say anything as she saw two of her closest friends standing before her. She didn't know what to say. What could she say? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jerking back when she saw one of them move towards her, she slammed the door, before immediately warping away when she heard the pair pound on the door, yelling at her to open up. Stumbling on her feet, Shez tried to calm herself as she fell back against a tree. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She thought she was ready for anything. Ready to do whatever it took to see her sister again. Yet all it took to make her panic was seeing her old friends…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you run away ag–” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sheer panic that flooded her mind the instant Epimenides spoke up felt like a bursting dam, a scream ripping its way out of her mouth as dark magic erupted from her body, rotting the trees and blackening the dirt around her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez trembled, her limbs shivering as she held her head, trying to fight down the mental distress that came with the sudden, overwhelming thought that Epimenides was going to murder her friends, that he would take control again and use her own body to hurt them–Then she noticed, out of the corner of her eye, the wraith in question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And he was strangely limp. His eyes were blank, staring at nothing, and his mouth hung open as he floated there, as though he’d been knocked out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then stared at him. He genuinely did look like he’d been knocked out. And as she watched, he just…faded, disappearing from view. “...uh…Ep? Epi? You…are you dead? I’m gonna be kinda disappointed if you’re dead because I really wanted to kill you myself and maybe get Arval back in the attempt? I was figuring it out, but, uh…hello? You there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tension hadn’t completely disappeared from her body. She still felt rigid enough that it was starting to hurt, and her breathing wasn’t steady at all, but…but…but what? She…was she free?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She glanced down at herself, seeing the markings still on her. Which probably meant that he was still alive, or that he had lied when he said this was his power. Shez was really hoping it was the latter. He was a liar, so honestly, it being stolen power would make sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...right. Right. Do I…talk to my friends? Because…what if he comes back? But also, they’re right there, I could just…fffh, damn it, this–Why are they here anyway?? I don’t…nnhhh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Right, she needed to figure something out. Even if they couldn't find her after she flashed away, she couldn't just–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"–surge of magic from over here!" And she couldn't help but stiffen, pushing back against the crumbling tree as she saw Lysithea and Kronya soon come into view. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez! There you are! Why are you running away from us?!” Lysithea called out, her brow furrowed in anger, “Where have you been anyway!? Were you really just here this whole–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she paused when Kronya put a hand on her shoulder, the Agarthan stepping forward with a small frown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Shez…Shez had no idea what she wanted to say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so, hey. I had no idea you were missing, but apparently you were,” Kronya began, her frown turning to a little smile as she seemed to relax, “And, uh…I guess you’re under arrest?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya glanced at Lysithea, who just gave her a genuinely baffled look in response. And Kronya apparently took that as agreement because she nodded. “Yup, you’re under arrest. Apparently you've been squatting without paying taxes for a few months, so…yeah." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez frowned. "Why would I pay? It's my house.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? That shitty looking place is yours?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes. It's where my mom raised me," Shez stated, annoyance cutting through her anxiety. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...ah. Well. Clearly we need to talk with the old guy. Right pipsqueak?" Kronya asked, looking at the mage to bail her out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Lysithea let out a sigh, before walking up to Shez. She stayed silent as she stared at the purple-haired girl, then silently reached out. "Come on, I have some tea and food in my supplies." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stared at her hand. For a moment, a thought flashed through her brain of Epimenides suddenly seizing control right as she took Lysithea’s hand and ramming his sword through her chest. “...Alright. I could use some tea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She made no move to touch Lysithea. She just…shook her head, and Lysithea lowered her hand after a moment, frowning. The tense feeling didn't leave the air as the trio walked together back to Shez’s house. Though it almost left when Shez spotted her broken door, which had been knocked off its hinges. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...You slammed the door on us and weren't answering," Kronya said, looking sheepish. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez let out a sigh, stepping inside, and picking up the door to try and put it back into place after Lysithea and Kronya entered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A few minutes later, the group was sitting at the table, having been joined by Leonie who had apparently been speaking with the village elder. The village elder was not invited in, particularly since Shez bluntly stated that she’d burn his house down the next time he tried to send people after her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t that kind of an overreaction?” Leonie had asked, “I mean, you are hiding out in a house that doesn’t–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s the one who threw me out of the village after my mom died,” Shez had replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Never mind then.” And now they were just kind of sitting around in awkward silence, waiting for the tea to heat up. “...so…what have you been doing these past few years?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Traveling. Killing people.” Shez paused. “From the Kingdom and the Principality, mainly. Plus bandits. And Almyrans, a couple times. Invading ones.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...okay then. And, uh…did you visit Captain Jeralt at all in that time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.” Shez’s response was blunt, clearly wanting the subject to be dropped, but her tone just made Leonie frown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why not? You’re his daughter–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I nearly killed my sister and sent her to the fucking void. Don’t ask me to go back to him until I get her back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s heavy as hell. Leonie, stop talking to her,” Kronya ordered. Thankfully, the orange-haired mercenary seemed too taken aback by Shez’s answer to hear what Kronya said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...So, you're that wandering soldier people have been talking about?" Lysithea asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shrugged. "I don't know what people are talking about, so I wouldn't know." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Shez, have you kept contact with…anyone, at all, since the monastery?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No. I…" Shez looked up at her friends, before grimacing at the image of Epimenides taking over and killing them. "I…I can't." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...jeez, you really feel guilty for what happened, huh?” Leonie commented, her frown more sympathetic now, “Shez, you don’t have to punish yourself–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Leonie, shush, you’re making it worse,” Kronya stated, before turning to look directly at Shez, “So, what happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Kronya, you can’t just ask her to relive what happened–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shhh, I know what I’m doing,” Kronya said, holding up a hand to ward off Leonie while staring at Shez, “Well? I’ll share if you do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I got possessed by a shitty ghost and he made me try to kill Byleth,” Shez explained, trying to keep her voice steady, though her tone just sounded dead as a result, “Then he forced me to use a spell that sent her to some sort of void. I don’t know the specifics, but she and Rhea were sent there so hopefully those two have each other." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So the professor is still alive?" Lysithea asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She has to be. There's no way she's dead." Shez stated, almost sounding desperate there. She took a breath, calming herself down. “I have a way to get to her. I just…I have a plan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cool, what is it?” Kronya promptly asked, looking very curious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…I…I need an Agarthan heart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Not mine, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“N-No?! No, never!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good. I like Professor Byleth but I’m not going to die for her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, why do you need a heart?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Cause our hearts are basically a chunk of magic, duh," Kronya said in response to Leonie. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So you'll use a heart for some type of ritual and save the professor?" Lysithea asked, trying to keep things on track. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As long as things work out. I haven't really been able to test it. I, uh, almost managed to, but things got too dangerous at the castle," Shez stated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right…" Lysithea sighed, before standing up. "Okay, we should shelve this conversation for tomorrow. It's late and you clearly need some rest." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's what I was planning on getting," Shez mumbled, only to stiffen as Lysithea glared at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Leonie, Kronya, come on, we shouldn’t impose on Shez, we can sleep elsewhere tonight." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? Hey, why do I have to go too??" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're still technically a bandit, so listen to me or I really will arrest you! Now come on!" Lysithea ordered, grabbing onto Kronya and pulling her along. Not that she had any success in doing so until Leonie helped her out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Staying quiet, Shez watched the three of them leave, before letting out a sigh as she stared at her tea cup. Getting up, she walked upstairs, only to pause when she passed her mom's room. She placed a hand on the door, before continuing on into her room. Once inside, she slumped down against a wall, exhaustion hitting her as she found herself unwilling to get in her bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was quiet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For the first time in years, she didn't have to deal with some annoying voice in her head, and now the world was finally quiet… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt tears prick her eyes, before rubbing them away, unwilling to break. She couldn't. Not yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So focused was she on keeping her grip, she nearly missed the door to her room opening. Stiffening, she looked up to see Lysithea standing at her doorway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I talked with the village elder, he's not going to try and kick you out of here anymore," Lysithea stated, her eyes briefly glancing around the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…thanks. That's really nice," Shez said, unsure of what else to say. The silence sat upon the two for a time, before Lysithea walked over, sitting down next to Shez, but leaving some distance between the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Have you been keeping up with your magic studies?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blinking at the sudden question, Shez glanced at Lysithea. "Ah…yeah. I'm, uh…still not the best mage around, but I think I'm almost as good as you were back at the academy." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Someone thinks highly of herself, I see." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh…well, maybe not that great…s-so…how's your arm?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Better. Took a few months to fully heal, but I can use it as easily as before," Lysithea said, raising the arm that had been broken in their last meeting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's good." She searched for something else to say. “...how are things going?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well enough. I gave up my noble title.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You did?” Shez paused. “Uh, congratulations? That’s…something you wanted?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is, yes. After everything that happened, my noble title was just a burden. It honestly feels much more freeing to be rid of it. Still, a part of me is bothered that House Phlegethon controls Castle Ordelia. It was my home, at one point, and it feels unpleasant knowing they’re using it to their own ends.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...well, uh…I was kind of planning to try going at them again, so…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea paused, then furrowed her brow. “Shez. Did you just say you want to take Castle Ordelia single handedly?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...uh…I mean…I have, uh…done pretty okay with doing stuff like that before?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ve taken castles before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...not exactly. I’ve taken forts though. By, uh, killing everyone inside. Honestly, I killed so many people that it permanently stained my sword red.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea sighed. “Shez, that’s not something that can–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez showed her the sword.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm. That’s disturbing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I think I might’ve cursed it. Not sure how, exactly…also kind feels like I should name it something other than ‘Killing Edge’ because of it? LIke…Murder Edge.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...That's stupid." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? No it's not. Murder is like, above killing right? So it makes sense." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez. That is stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez crossed her arms over her chest, pouting. “I think it’s a great name…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course you do," Lysithea muttered, "Look, the point is I'm not letting you storm a castle on your own." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I can handle it," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It doesn't matter if you can." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Look I don't even need to take the entire thing I just need–" Shez stiffened as Lysithea grabbed her face, forcing the older girl to look at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We're helping you, got it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez felt a tightness in her chest as her body began to shake. She didn't even realize she had started to cry until Lysithea pulled away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez? What's wrong?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez shook her head, as she rubbed her eyes. "S-Sorry, just…that's the first time someone touched me in years. I…I'm good, I just–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt Lysithea wrap her arms around her, hugging her as tightly as the mage could. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In that moment, feeling the first physical comfort she had felt in years, Shez couldn't help but cry. Unable to hold herself back any longer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn't sure how long the two sat there, but by the end, Shez was exhausted, her eyes stinging from her tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on, you should get some rest," Lysithea encouraged, helping Shez stand up and guiding her to the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Thanks," Shez mumbled, practically collapsing on the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do not thank me. Just promise me you won't go off on your own," she requested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’ll try. I…I don’t want to be alone anymore…” Shez murmured in reply, exhaustion dragging her down into unconsciousness, where she dreamt of destroyed cities and people that died ages ago, their names lost to time and their faces long forgotten. All she knew was, as she awoke, that she was holding her Agarthan sword in her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The fear that went through her in that moment saw her practically spring out of bed and rush out of the room, all exhaustion forgotten–Until she saw Lysithea, sleeping on her couch. Completely unharmed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...fhhhh…fuck…okay. Okay…” The blade was clean. She…wasn’t sure what that meant. She wasn’t sure why the sword was even out. Had she called it? Why? “...Epimenides? Are you there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No answer, aside from Lysithea stirring in her sleep and muttering a complaint about someone stealing her cake, before she settled back down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...huh. Alright. Okay.” She still wasn’t sure what any of this meant. All she knew was that she felt a strange sense, in the back of her mind, that this sword…belonged to her. And she knew its name. “...Rudra. Hm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For some reason, she found her gaze turning toward her mom’s room. She hadn’t gone in there in…she hadn’t gone in there at all, not since she got back. Other than just a cursory check to make sure nothing had broken, she hadn’t ever gone inside…And she felt herself walking over, opening up the door, and stepping inside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t sure why she thought there would be something crazy in here; her mom’s bedroom looked the same, untouched from all the years she’d been away…and kind of dusty. It felt sort of nostalgic though. She remembered her mom letting her sleep in here when she was little or if she felt sick or scared…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez took a little breath and brushed away the tears before they could really gather in her eyes. She really had been ignoring this place for far too long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Walking over to the bookshelf in the room, she grabbed a book and began to see what she could find. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was illuminating, in a sense. She didn't read deeply into the books she was reading, but she found various types. Books on how to care for the young, cookbooks filled with healthy recipes, and various other books that seemed more in line with someone trying to raise a child, rather than a mysterious mage who was on the run from the Agarthans. It made sense, in a way. Her mom had always been great, so knowing she just put her all into raising her…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez hugged a book to her chest. “I wish you were here…there’s so much I want to ask you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Setting the book down, she continued to search, making sure to be careful and not damage any of them. As she did, she couldn't help but pause as she pulled a book near the bottom out. Though she didn't focus on the book, but on something behind it. Frowning, she reached out, her fingers pressing against the wood, as she felt a slight give. It wasn't completely moving, but she could feel something was there… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taking a deep breath, she focused her magic in hand, before hearing a click, the wooden panel suddenly giving way as she found a small alcove hidden behind it. Inside was a single book, and a letter with a wax seal on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her fingers trembling, Shez reached out, grabbing the letter, and pulling it out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The seal was nondescript, nothing to signal who it could be from but…Shez knew who left it there. Taking a deep breath, she opened the letter, making sure to take care not to break it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Hello, my darling daughter, </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I hope this letter finds you well. I'm not sure when you'll find it, if at all. As it stands, I am writing this while you are asleep so you will not even know it exists until you find it. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Regardless, I felt it only appropriate to write this. I know not when it will be my time, but my illness is only getting worse, and I do not know how long it will be before I perish. It is almost silly to think about. Here I am, dying to a Fodlan disease, yet I cannot muster any hatred for them. All I feel is sorrow knowing I will not be here to see you grow. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I do not know when you will find this letter. I hope it is not too long. I hope you will be well. I hope I get an opportunity to speak with you before my end but I am uncertain if I will be able to. I hope for a great many things, but most of all, I hope you will find happiness in this world we live in.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We are not from Fodlan. If I did not get a chance to tell you this, allow me to inform you of this fact now. You and I are from a nation that predates all others on this continent. We are from Shambhala. Our people are called Agarthan.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>There is so much more I want to tell you. I wish I could have told you when you were an adult, as I planned. I intend to leave this letter with my notes. There will be things in there that may disturb you. I love you. I want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world. No matter what we were intended for, I love you. You are my sunlight. I wish I had more time with you.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It had long since dried, but Shez could see stains on the letter, smudging the words near the end. She tried her best to keep her own tears from staining it, holding the letter close. She was careful with it; gentle, really.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she set it down in a faint sigh, then began to look through the book of her mother’s notes. It wasn’t a proper book; there was a cover and there were pages inside, but she quickly found that it wasn’t really written like a straightforward journal or narrative. The entries in it were a mix of notes, sketches, experiments, projects…it was surprisingly eclectic for what she knew of her mother, almost like she’d just taken everything she had and bound it together in one place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was some rhythm, as she seemed to put the older notes first. They seemed so different compared to the first letter she had received, notes on experiments written with no personal inflection. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That all changed when she got to her notes on the vessel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez wasn't the first one. And she certainly wasn't the first one Periander worked on. Yet she was the first seemingly successful one. Periander noted how she had survived past her first year, which meant things were finally turning positive. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And suddenly, there was an entry that was just a single line. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The child smiled at me. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez almost expected to see a follow up entry saying how Periander’s view had changed and she had to get the child out of there, or some kind of declaration of her intent to defect…but it just continued on for a while. There were more observations, more notes about how Shez was progressing. There were important things recorded, like when she started crawling and when she spoke her first word, but they were more like secondary observations. There was a mention of how she’d taken over the “vessel’s development” while the other researchers moved on to other projects. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a timeline written out of what would be expected from Shez as she grew. How she’d be trained in combat and magic, how she’d be educated. There was a note that she would be expected to fight in a live combat exercise and would only be considered a success if she lived.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The words there were a little darker. Like Periander had been pressing down more firmly with whatever she was using to write.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next entry Periander wrote was about starting her new life in a town she had stumbled upon. From then on her entries seemed to be more on her day to day life, speaking about how Shez had grown up, how even if it was just the two of them, it was the most fulfilled she had felt in her entire life. Shez tried not to cry at that, before she kept on reading.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On and on it went. Even when Periander noted her illness and how it grew worse, she would always make sure to write about Shez first and foremost. And eventually it came to an end, the last entry being about how she and Shez celebrated together, in honor of the day they arrived at the village. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was still more afterwards. Spells that Periander had put in great detail for Shez to train and study with. Locations of Agarthan bases were, so that Shez would know where to avoid. But the one thing that made Shez’s heart stop was the final page of the journal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The forbidden spell, Zahras. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It came with a warning that Shez should only use it as a last resort. Utilizing the power of the void was dangerous, and the potential to be lost in it herself was way too high. Which actually meant it was perfect for Shez’s purposes…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She couldn't help but grin at the mention that the only one with the power to control the darkness was the Great Sage, Epimenides. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez? What are you doing in there?” Then Lysithea’s voice caught her attention, drawing Shez’s gaze over to the former noble in the doorway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Figuring out how to save the day," Shez said, before moving over and hugging Lysithea tightly, "Thanks, Lys." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...ah…you’re welcome?” She wasn’t quite sure why she was being thanked or hugged, but…Shez gave nice hugs, so she leaned into it. It probably wasn't the right time to focus on how firm Shez felt, yet she also couldn't help but focus on that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she heard a scandalized gasp behind her and turned to see Kronya staring at the two of them. “You harlot! Is Leonie not enough for you!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WHAT!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you and Leonie are a thing?” Shez asked, looking at Lysithea with a mild curiosity, “Huh, guess that explains–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re not! Why–That’s not–We aren’t dating! At all!” Lysithea insisted, prompting a scoff from Kronya.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, right, and you definitely don’t have a thing for strong, firm mercenary girls either, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sh-Shut up!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey Lys, it's alright if you have a crush on Leonie. Though I think she has a thing for Lorenz, so you better hurry up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't have a crush on her!" Lysithea almost shouted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure you don't," Kronya said, clearly not believing her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll prove it!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And how are you going to do that?" Kronya asked, raising an eyebrow in a clear challenge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Geh…" Lysithea glanced at Shez, before nodding, and grabbing her by the collar. Shez had a moment to widen her eyes, before she was pulled into a kiss. Lysithea wasn't exactly sure how long she was supposed to keep the kiss going, because she certainly wasn't going to make it just a peck and get mocked for it afterwards. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It seemed Kronya decided it was long enough with how she yanked Lysithea away. The Agarthan glowered at the mage for a moment, before promptly pulling a stunned Shez into a deep, forceful kiss…which soon transitioned to her pushing Shez to the floor, their lips still locked together as Kronya pressed up indecently close to her crush.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, hey Lysithea. Is Shez up y–...” Leonie blinked, staring at the two girls tongue-wrestling on the floor, before looking at her friend, whose face was quite red at the moment. “...well, uh…sorry Lysithea, I guess you missed your shot?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–No I didn’t, I kissed her first,” Lysithea insisted, frowning–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Kronya immediately pushed herself up from her current make-out session, glaring at the white-haired girl, “The hell you did! I kissed her first!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No you did not–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I did! Three years ago, when I left! I kissed her first! Right Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez didn’t respond. “Bwuh.” No, wait, she did. She just didn’t respond intelligibly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea rolled her eyes. "Oh sure, of course you did. Shez never said anything about that after you left!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? Why didn't you??" Kronya asked, turning in Shez who seemed to be staring off into the distance with a dazed look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I think you might’ve broken her,” Leonie pointed out, earning a frustrated noise from Kronya.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Shez! Stop being broken! I need you to confirm that I claimed you first!” Kronya said, shaking Shez. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"E-Even if you did kiss her, it's childish to think that means you claimed her!" Lysithea shouted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shut up, pipsqueak!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Gh–Stop calling me that! I'm taller than you now!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Leonie let out a sigh, before backing out of the room, and quietly closing the door behind her. She already had a long day waiting for her, she could feel it. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Shez was still feeling weird, for a lot of reasons. </p><p> </p><p>For one thing, Epimenides was still silent. She had no idea why he hadn’t come back yet, and she was positive he wouldn’t be gone forever, but for now, his absence was…surprisingly refreshing. She’d gotten used to his constant unpleasantness. Now that it wasn’t there…it was like a weight had been lifted.</p><p> </p><p>For a second thing, she had her friends again. And two of them had crushes on her.</p><p> </p><p>…She was going to focus on the part where they were around for the moment because she still wasn’t sure how to take that. She should probably talk to Lysithea and Kronya about…everything at some point, but at the moment, she was just processing a lot of emotions at once.</p><p> </p><p>And traveling. She was also traveling at the moment, because apparently it would be a bad thing to stay in her house all the time. Which, well, she could always warp back, so traveling wasn’t that big of a commitment. Though, considering she was traveling towards Gloucester territory to talk to Count Gloucester, Lorenz, and the other people trying to retake Castle Ordelia, it was still kind of a commitment…</p><p> </p><p>But those were complicated thoughts and she didn’t really want to think those at the moment, so she was distracting herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Slaughter Edge,” she suggested.</p><p> </p><p>“The Bloody Blade,” Kronya countered.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…Blood Edge?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t rip me off. What about ‘The Crimson Carver?’”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s neat. Hm…maybe ‘The Red Reaper’?”</p><p> </p><p>“The Scarlet Slicer?”</p><p> </p><p>“The Carnelian Cleaver…”</p><p> </p><p>“The Vermillion Violator!”</p><p> </p><p>“Eugh. That sounds wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why do I like her…” Lysithea muttered to herself, staring at the purple-haired idiot walking ahead of her.</p><p> </p><p>"Well it could be worse," Leonie said, trying to comfort her. </p><p> </p><p>"How?" </p><p> </p><p>"You could have a crush on Kronya." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Lysithea let out a loud sigh. <em> Hopefully this journey won't take too long… </em></p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, up ahead of them, Shez and Kronya were still debating potential sword names.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I’m thinking about this the wrong way,” the purple-haired mercenary mused, “It’s a special cursed sword, so it needs something special to call it, like how the sacred weapons and relic weapons all have fancy names.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, those things…” Kronya shrugged. “I just call my dagger Athame.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? What’s that mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“Knife.”</p><p> </p><p>“...seriously?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I guess it’s more like ‘ceremonial knife’ or ‘black knife’,” the redheaded Agarthan allowed, shrugging again, “Also, don’t the relic weapons have a bunch of different names? I know there’s that one lance thing that’s just ‘the lance of whatever’ and then there some type of hammer that’s just ‘the crusher’–”</p><p> </p><p>“So I could call it something like ‘the carver’?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, but why not add the ‘crimson’ part at that point? You might as well, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess…I just feel like it should be something special. You know, something that feels as unique as ‘The Sword of the Creator’.”</p><p> </p><p>“Like that, huh? So what about ‘The Sword of the Destroyer’?”</p><p> </p><p>“…maybe not that unique,” Shez muttered, before pausing when she noticed a flag in the distance, “Huh. Hey Lysithea, which crest is that?”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea paused, raising an eyebrow. “What in the world are you talking about–Huh?” Then her eyes widened and she quickly pushed past Shez and Kronya to stare at the lavender flag flying the Crest of Gloucester right above a banner of the Alliance. “What the–Is that the Gloucester camp!?”</p><p> </p><p>“Is it?” Kronya asked, squinting at the distant flags.</p><p> </p><p>“What? That can’t be right, we should be at least a couple days away from…” Leonie trailed off, spotting the flags too, and the fact that they were clearly flying above a fortified war camp, judging by the barricades and wooden walls set up around the area. “...what the hell…”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Guess we took a shortcut,” Shez commented, shrugging while Lysithea and Leonie stared at her in open bafflement, genuinely wondering if their friend’s tendency to get lost had somehow translated into them somehow getting to the military camp way ahead of schedule. “Well whatever. Let’s go say hi!”</p><p> </p><p>And so, off she went. And while the guards at the gate were understandably wary of unexpected travelers, Lysithea had a way with words that barreled through any objections and got them into camp pretty easily. The fact that she was the former heir of Ordelia and had the crest to prove it certainly made things easy.</p><p> </p><p>And once inside, another familiar face looked quite happy to see them.</p><p> </p><p>“Lysithea, Leonie! I cannot say I was expecting to see you two so soon! And–“ Lorenz froze when he spotted Shez, before a small, genuine smile came to the nobleman’s face. “My word…I…you look well, Shez.”</p><p> </p><p>“…ah, screw it,” Shez decided, before heading over to the skinny noble and pulling him into a tight hug, “I missed you, buddy.”</p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh, well, I–“ Lorenz didn’t seem to know what to do with his hands for the moment, and actually seemed relieved when Shez released him. “I must say, I didn’t expect such a display of affection.”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh, it’s more like appreciation. I mean hell, Lysithea kissed me, so I figure a hug is fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“She did?”</p><p> </p><p>“She did, huh?” Leonie echoed, giving the blushing girl an amused glance, “You know, that doesn’t feel very fair to me. I didn’t even get a hug yet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, good point,” Shez allowed, before heading over to the redhead and fully picking her up in a hug, earning a startled laugh from her.</p><p> </p><p>Lorenz, meanwhile, paused when he noticed the frowning fourth member of Lysithea’s group. “Oh, hello. May I ask who you might be, Miss?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s Kronya, we met, I was going by Emily then,” Kronya bluntly explained, before pausing, “Huh. You filled out.”</p><p> </p><p>Lorenz blinked, trying to process all of that. “Pardon me?”</p><p> </p><p>“You put on muscle. I remember you being lankier, like a tall stick.” </p><p> </p><p>He blinked again, his mind finally catching up enough to feel outraged. “A stick?! How did I look like a stick?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Like I said, you were really lanky. You are good at tea parties though and it’s been a while since I’ve had some, so I’d be pretty happy if you invited me to one,” Kronya said, shrugging her shoulders. "Turns out I actually started enjoying the taste of the stuff, go figure." </p><p> </p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>“...oh hey, it’s the glasses guy,” she noticed, walking past him and over to Ignatz, who blinked in confusion at seeing a strange cloaked woman approaching him.</p><p> </p><p>"...Can someone please explain to me what's going on?" Lorenz asked, ignoring Kronya talking with Ignatz, who seemed confused and embarrassed at how she was complimenting him over no longer being a 'little geek'. </p><p> </p><p>"It's a long story, one we can get into once we finish planning things out," Shez said, as she grinned, "Congrats Lorenz, you're gonna help us take back Lysithea’s old home." </p><p> </p><p>It was a dramatic declaration, one befitting the Violet Demon’s return to the field.</p><p> </p><p>“Er, yes? That’s why we moved our camp here.” And then Lorenz ruined it by giving her a confused look. “In fact, you would be helping us, if you were to consider how we were here first.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh so you did move the camp!” Leonie realized, looking relieved, “Man, I thought Shez managed to somehow shrink the distance between her village and the main camp.”</p><p> </p><p>“How in the world would she do that?”</p><p> </p><p>“I have no idea, I was just–”</p><p> </p><p>“Can we just discuss how we are taking the castle back now?” Lysithea requested, prompting a pause from the pair of former Deer.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yes, of course! Please, follow me!” And so, Lorenz led the way!</p><p> </p><p>“...I was trying to do something there,” Shez muttered, before sighing and following after her pompous friend. Though she did make sure to at least wave at her other former classmate. “Ah, hey Ignatz.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh–Oh, hello Shez,” he greeted in reply, then looked back at Kronya again, “Er, now what was that about you being Em–...wait, hold on–”</p><hr /><p>“Wow, this all looks really fancy,” Shez commented, genuinely impressed as she looked around Lorenz’s big war tent, prompting a proud smile from the nobleman.</p><p> </p><p>“Why thank you! I like to make sure my war tent is capable of accommodating anyone as needed, particularly–”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh hey, grapes,” Kronya noticed, not paying attention to Lorenz at all while she went over to grab herself a snack.</p><p> </p><p>“…it seems your manners have deserted you almost entirely after leaving the academy, Emily,” Lorenz noted, frowning at the Agarthan.</p><p> </p><p>“Well yeah, I didn’t have to use them,” she replied without shame, “Also, call me Kronya, it’s my actual name. I mentioned that part, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“You did introduce yourself as such, though you didn’t truly explain yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, it’s a whole thing. Should I tell everybody now or should I wait until the rest of the Deer show up?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m afraid most of our former classmates will not be attending this meeting,” Lorenz replied, before pausing, “Though, come to think of it, I suppose given there are six of us here, we actually do have most of the class present.”</p><p> </p><p>“…so do I tell everyone now, or…?”</p><p> </p><p>“Would it help with the upcoming battle if you told us now?” Lysithea asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Probably not,” Kronya replied, shrugging.</p><p> </p><p>“Then save it for later. We need to focus on what’s immediately relevant right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Speaking of, what’s the plan, Lorenz?” Leonie asked, catching the noble’s attention.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I’m glad you asked! You see, my father and I are coordinating a two pronged attack on Castle Ordelia so that we might finally retake it–”</p><p> </p><p>“I got that part,” she interrupted, “What’s the actual plan though?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, right. You see, Castle Ordelia has been difficult to take due to a number of–”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s full of demonic beasts and the Agarthans holding it are completely fine with letting them loose if anyone gets close,” Shez commented, earning a small frown from Lorenz that she didn’t notice as she thought about her recent infiltration attempt, “I didn’t get an exact count of all their beasts, but they have at least a dozen of the big walker types patrolling the outside of the castle and around eight flyers up on the ramparts, along with more inside. I’d say…you’d probably have to deal with twenty of the big walker types altogether. And considering they probably have a few more in reserve, I’d say you should assume there are at least ten flyers around the castle at any given time.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Lorenz looked over at Ignatz. “Could you write that down?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? O-Oh, yes, of course!”</p><p> </p><p>While his knight quickly got to work, Lorenz focused back on Shez, looking very intently at her. “How far did you manage to get into Castle Ordelia?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…not that far into the main building, I think. I did manage to catch one of their bosses, at least. Do you know about Bias?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh of course that bitch is around here,” Kronya complained, earning a curious glance from Lorenz.</p><p> </p><p>“I believe I might need some more context before I make any assumptions of who ‘Bias’ is meant to be. I would also like to know what your relation is to these ‘Agarthans’.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, right, let me explain real quick–” Shez paused when the flap to the tent was abruptly pushed open by a knight in Alliance yellow.</p><p> </p><p>“Lord Lorenz, we have wyvern riders approaching from the west.”</p><p> </p><p>“From the west? Hm…well, it seems we might have another guest arriving soon.” He sighed while his fellow former Deer just looked confused. Though that confusion quickly turned to exasperation for Lysithea when she spotted a certain white wyvern approaching.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course it had to be Claude…”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey there, everybody!” Claude called out, a wide grin on his face as he landed and promptly hopped off his wyvern, who chuffed when Claude gave it a pat on the head, “I hope I’m not interrupting the heartfelt reunion here.”</p><p> </p><p>“You are not–Wait, how did you know there was even a reunion going on!?” Lorenz questioned, openly baffled.</p><p> </p><p>“Well I couldn’t help but notice our Lady Lysithea’s distinct white hair, and once that was there, it was pretty easy to spot Leonie’s fiery hair,” he replied, grinning at the former noble and current mercenary, before he visibly stiffened…and a lazy smirk came to his face as he raised a hand in greeting. “Hey there, Shez. Good to see you.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Jeez, nothing fazes you, huh?” Shez responded, feeling a small grin come to her face at her friend’s antics.</p><p> </p><p>“What can I say? I like to take things as they come.” Then he glanced at Kronya. “Hey Emily, how are you doing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Pretty good. Had some grapes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh that’s bullshit!” Shez exclaimed, half-surprised and half-amused, “How in the world did you guess that she’s Em?”</p><p> </p><p>Claude shrugged. “She’s the same height as before.” That, and it was the luckiest guess of his life, but he wasn’t about to say that. “So, are we holding a class reunion? Because it might take a bit to get Hilda, Raphael, and Balthus over here if it is. That and I still don't know where Cyril is." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, to be specific, we're preparing our assault on Castle Ordelia. We were also about to be informed by Shez on what exactly these Agarthans are." </p><p> </p><p>"Buncha underground assholes who hate you all," Kronya helpfully chimed in. </p><p> </p><p>"...Well, she's not wrong. I don't really know the specifics, mostly because the only guy I know who knows anything is a completely untrustworthy asshole, but apparently they're a group of people who fought against the goddess. After losing, they apparently hid underground throughout Fodlan," Shez explained. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…well, that's both good and bad news. Good in that we finally know for sure what we're up against, but bad in that we don't know where they are," Claude muttered. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I actually do," Shez responded, before taking a notebook out of her pack, "My mom left me this apparently. It's got a bunch of info, including where the Agarthan’s bases are!" </p><p> </p><p>"..." Claude couldn't help but stare at the notebook, and he was sure everyone else was as well. "...Do you mind if I borrow that?" </p><p> </p><p>"Yes. I'll point out on a map where the bases apparently are." </p><p> </p><p>"Aw, come on Shez, not gonna let your dear old friend check it?" Claude asked, giving her a wink, "If you don't I might just have to sneak it off you later." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Shez took a deep breath in, before laughing as she put the book away, "Goddess, I can't believe I missed how much of an asshole you are." </p><p> </p><p>“So should I take that–”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t push it. I can and will beat up anyone who takes this without my permission.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll stab them,” Kronya added, offering her support and smirking smugly at Lysithea, who bristled.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we get back to the topic at hand?” the former noble requested, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, right, let’s do that,” Shez agreed, nodding, “Okay, so, starting from the top…”</p><p> </p><p>And so, the next few minutes were spent getting everyone caught up on the basics of the Agarthan people, their apparent cultural grudge against the goddess herself and the church as a whole, and who the leaders were. Which did answer a lot of questions for Claude, considering he still hadn’t known for sure who these “cultists” that hated the church were, and certainly explained some things about Shez and Emily/Kronya.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I see, so then this Bias woman is the Red Mage!” Lorenz remarked after Shez explained the whole deal with the Agarthan’s “sage of fire” and how she’d infiltrated, then later invaded, the monastery.</p><p> </p><p>That made Shez blink. “The Red Mage?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I know, it’s not a very impressive name, but while I put forth ‘The Crimson Sorceress’, Hilda insisted it was too ‘wordy’–”</p><p> </p><p>“It is kinda wordy,” Leonie commented in good humor, “Though to answer the question, she’s one of the more dangerous people who have been causing problems in the Alliance. A really powerful fire mage whose burned entire battalions, if the rumors are true.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, they are accurate,” Lorenz noted, frowning, “She’s remarkably dangerous and we’ve had her as a priority target for a while now, alongside The Black Knight and The Flame Emperor.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez blinked, genuinely surprised by that last one. She’d never actually encountered the guy that gave her sister trouble, and the last she saw, the guy in question, assuming the weirdo in armor at the monastery invasion had been the Flame Emperor, wound up getting killed by Epi. So, odds were, someone else could have taken up the mantle–</p><p> </p><p>“You mean Edelgard?” Kronya asked, an eyebrow raised.</p><p> </p><p>The silence in the tent was deafening, though it was also short-lived, broken before its time by Shez face-palming. “Of course she is…”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Lorenz asked after a moment, looking genuinely confused, “No, the…right, I realize where there might be some confusion, but the Flame Emperor is a mercenary, or at least we presume he is a mercenary, working for the Principality. He may be an Agarthan, now that we are more aware of that faction, but I assure you, he isn’t the actual emperor. Plenty of bandits like to use royal titles for themselves and that doesn’t mean they are actual royalty.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, I know that. I also know the Flame Emperor is Edelgard,” Kronya replied, “It’s the identity she wore when she was helping us infiltrate the monastery.”</p><p> </p><p>"Wait, seriously?" Leonie blinked, before trying to connect the dots. "Edelgard… I know she's the Emperor now, and she can use fire magic but…no, that can't be it, that's too stupid, right?" </p><p> </p><p>“...I called it,” Claude said, nodding to himself.</p><p> </p><p>“You did not,” Lysithea retorted, giving him an annoyed glare.</p><p> </p><p>“Nah, I absolutely knew it.”</p><p> </p><p>"Wait, you knew that the entire time and didn't say anything??" Shez asked, bewildered.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, not the entire time, but I figured it out at some point.”</p><p> </p><p>“Was that point two seconds ago when Kronya said it?” Lysithea questioned, openly annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m pretty sure it was longer than two seconds ago that she spoke up. Still, I guess I should assume from your reaction, Shez, that you just realized it now?” he asked, grinning over at her, “You seemed pretty exasperated there.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…well, yeah, I do feel kind of dumb now. Edelgard confessed to me that she had to help the Agarthans for reasons, it was a whole thing–”</p><p> </p><p>“She did!? Then shouldn’t we–” Lorenz began before Shez held up a hand.</p><p> </p><p>“They killed her entire family except for her dad, so I decided to give her a pass. She also fought them at the monastery, which probably means they’re not allies. Which raises some big questions about what she’s doing working for them again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, I don’t think that makes sense,” Leonie noted, frowning, “I’m not sure how to take the whole ‘she was working with those people’ thing–”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean ‘those people’?” Kronya complained, frowning at her, which she ignored.</p><p> </p><p>“–but she’s been in Adrestia for the past few years fighting a war on two fronts against the Kingdom and the Principality. I don’t think she could be doing that and popping up in random places across the Alliance for the past few months.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so it’s a recent thing?” Shez asked, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed, it is,” Lorenz spoke up, still frowning thoughtfully, though he shook his head, “The Flame Emperor has only been sighted in the past six months though his preceding reputation for infiltrating the monastery has bolstered the threat he presents. Or, well, she presents?”</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t actually know who this new Flame Emperor is, or if they even are Edelgard,” Claude noted, “Though having testimony that she actually helped the Agarthans infiltrate the Church is an interesting tidbit…”</p><p> </p><p>Shez frowned at her friend’s calculating tone, before pausing when she noticed Lysithea being strangely quiet. She moved over to the mage, leaning in and speaking in a low tone. “Hey, you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I believe I am.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Did you know about, uh…?”</p><p> </p><p>“I did not, no. I am…considering how I feel.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, yeah.” Shez held out her hand, then smiled slightly when Lysithea took it. She led the shorter girl out of the tent and found a place by some boxes to sit down. “So, ah…do you want to talk about things?”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea raised an eyebrow. “‘Things’?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, things in general. I don’t know if you want to talk about the Agarthan stuff, so I figure we can leave it open for anything you might want to talk about.”</p><p> </p><p>“…You truly are ridiculous, Shez. And I missed having you around.”</p><p> </p><p>"I missed being around you too," Shez responded, a sad smile on her face, "I'm sorry I was away for so long, but I swear, if it wasn't for Epimenides, I would have come to find you. After all, a student needs her teacher, right?" </p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. Well…if you intend to still learn from me, I suppose I could teach you some of what I’ve learned over these past few years. Though I imagine you must have improved as well.”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh…well, I’ve definitely gotten better at killing people…oh, hey, actually–” Shez pulled out her mother’s journal, a smile coming to her face as she moved close to Lysithea. “Here, my mom put a lot of spell stuff at the end of her notes here. Do you think you could help me figure it out?”</p><p> </p><p>“...you would trust me with your mother’s work?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well yeah, of course. I trust you.”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea stared at Shez for a moment, before abruptly hugging the taller girl, earning a surprised noise from her.</p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh, uh…well, I guess we can start by hugging,” she murmured, before smiling slightly as she returned Lysithea’s hug. “...I really have missed you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I gotta make sure you know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmf. You truly are a ridiculous woman,” Lysithea mumbled into Shez’s chest, continuing to hold her tightly. “You are very lucky I like you.”</p><p> </p><p>That brought a small smile to Shez’s face. “Yeah. I know I am.”</p>

  <span>“You know, when you said Ignatz made some pictures of our enemies to help with, uh…what was the word?” Shez asked, though she didn’t avert her gaze from the ‘pictures’ in question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Visualization,” Lysithea answered, also staring at Ignatz’s work.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, visualization. So yeah, when you said that, I thought you meant they’d be sketches or ink prints, sort of like what you’d see on a wanted poster. Not full of paintings.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Because those were indeed full paintings in front of their group, one for each of the “top three”. One displayed a knight in black plate armor with curled ram horns on his helm, wielding a three-pronged lance wreathed in darkness; the second showed a mage with a crimson bird’s mask over her face and robes that were a perfect match for Bias’s, her hands gathering flames at her palms; and the last was of a very familiar armored individual, the white mask-like faceplate standing out to everyone who had seen it before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A scarlet axe was held in one hand and a shield in the other, and Shez felt a faint shiver as she stared into its empty eyes. “Alright, that’s seriously impressive, but also really creepy, Ignatz.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh, um, sorry?” the nearby knight apologized.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s good. Just…it’s not creepy that you can do this, I’m still impressed, I’m just saying the face here looks really creepy. Does it really look like that? I didn’t see it for that long at the monastery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yep, it looks exactly like that,” Leonie confirmed, “And I have to say, it makes a weird amount of sense that it apparently started as Edelgard’s disguise. Sort of like how Jeritza turning out to be the Death Knight just made sense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh yeah, speaking of, who exactly knows about her being the Flame Emperor?" Claude asked from his place over by the war map, "Aside from Hubert anyways." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, if she hasn't told the Black Eagles, then the only one who probably knew was Byleth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor Byleth knew?" Lorenz inquired, also standing by the war map.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, apparently Edelgard told her back before the ball at Garreg Mach. So if nothing else, if Byleth is willing to trust her I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Especially since Rhea is a bigger threat to her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Wait, why would Lady Rhea be a threat?" Ignatz asked, sounding very curious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Because she wants to sacrifice Byleth to bring back the goddess." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh. I see.” Ignatz blinked. “I’ll admit, I didn’t expect that answer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s kinda crazy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. So, hey, quick question,” Claude spoke up, “Does that whole ‘sacrifice Professor Byleth to bring back the goddess’ thing have anything to do with the group of crazed knights squatting in the Red Canyon that claims they saw the goddess descend three years ago?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...there’s a bunch of what?” Shez asked, before pausing when Lorenz made an annoyed noise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, of course, the ‘Knights of Reclamation’. A group of true lunatics who were already disavowed by the remnants of the Knights of Seiros, particularly given they’ve taken to raiding supply lines.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’ve been raiding you guys?? Wait, doesn’t that make them bandits?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In a sense,” Claude agreed, shrugging, “The thing is, they’re well-armed and armored, and they fight against the principality’s forces, so we’ve been tolerating them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Even though they’re raiding supply lines?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lorenz grimaced. “Well, I suppose it’s less ‘raiding’ and more just ‘stealing from’, but even if they make sure not to harm anyone, they are still robbing necessary supplies from us to support themselves instead of properly joining with the remaining Knights of Seiros.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah, that’s also a thing,” Shez noted, “What do you mean the Knights of Seiros are still around?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, it's mainly the remnants of the knights who tried to take back Castle Ordelia back before everything went bad, but they're still calling themselves that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, so Alois and Shamir are okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And Catherine." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Well I'm glad Alois and Shamir are doing fine. Where are they anyways?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shamir should be with my father right now,” Lorenz answered, “She has been invaluable in facing off against the demonic beasts that make up Phlegethon’s forces. As for Alois, he has essentially stepped up as the captain of the true Knights of Seiros while Jeralt is busy in Adrestia. Speaking of, we have attempted to make contact with your father, but there have been some difficulties due to the Principality intercepting our messengers, so I apologize if it may take some time to get in touch with him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah, uh, that’s fine, I get it, things are tricky these days,” Shez responded, trying not to sound too awkward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So back to the main point, it sounds like we’re going to have to deal with the Red Mage, also known as Bias, if we want a shot at taking Castle Ordelia,” Leonie brought up, drawing everyone’s attention back to the matter at hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, she might be a problem,” Lorenz agreed, nodding thoughtfully, “If fortune favors us, she may be drawn towards my father’s forces. He and Shamir are intending to take the majority of our army into combat against the demonic beasts while my battalions instead aim to take this fortress here–“ He pointed to a small figure of a fort set on the map. “–which, thanks to Shez, we have confirmed is indeed an Agarthan outpost.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was my mom’s work, not mine,” Shez demurred.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Either way, it is very helpful. As you all likely know already, Castle Ordelia has been fortified heavily these past few years. In its early days, when the Principality was established and the traitors of Leicester and Adrestia joined forces, there was a steady stream of supplies sent to the castle House Phlegethon now occupies. However, thanks to my and my father’s efforts–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Plus all the soldiers under your command,” Leonie commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, of course, we cannot forget their valiant efforts either! It was thanks to all of us that we gradually struck down their supply lines and successfully drove them into the corner that they now find themselves in. However, despite our efforts to essentially starve them out, House Phlegethon hasn’t broken yet, which is what led us to believe they may have ways of getting supplies into the castle without detection.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you think this fort has a secret tunnel in it then,” Claude noted, prompting a small frown from Lorenz.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well…yes, essentially.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t it make more sense for their supply line to be coming from the south?” Lysithea pointed out, an eyebrow raised, “If their supplies are coming from what used to be Empire territory, it wouldn’t make sense for a more northward fort to be where they smuggle it in from.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Unless they’re not using it to smuggle food,” Shez noted, frowning thoughtfully, “They need people to make demonic beasts. It wouldn’t be impossible for this to be where they’re sending them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...well that’s a morbid thought,” Leonie muttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not an inaccurate one though,” Lysithea remarked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still, it doesn’t sound like a bad idea to at least check it out,” Shez continued, “Either there is a tunnel or isn’t, but either way, we’ll have taken one of their outposts and we can use it as a staging point to invade the fuckers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That isn’t quite how I would put it, but you grasp the spirit perfectly!” Lorenz said with a grin, “Now, shall we begin planning our attack? I would prefer to be ready as soon as possible so we can schedule the attack to line up with my father’s offense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez raised her hand. “Could we do it today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Ah…well, I wanted to plan ahead–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Could </span>
  </em>
  <span>we do it today?” Claude echoed, raising an eyebrow at the noble, who immediately straightened at the challenge in his rival’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can and we will!” Lorenz declared, before promptly pushing his way out of the tent, “MAKE YOURSELVES READY, SOLDIERS! TODAY IS THE DAY WE SHALL SEIZE THAT FORT!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow. He gets loud when he’s being commanding,” Kronya noted, before glancing at Leonie, “Lucky you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…Yeah, I don’t know what that’s supposed to mean.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It means what it means.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alright guys, I hope you're ready to fight. And remember, try to capture at least one of these guys alive, if possible," Shez said before Leonie could respond. "If all goes well, then we'll have some amazing back up for when we take the actual castle!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We will? Who?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez beamed. “The absolute best back-up we could ever ask for.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The fort wasn’t important enough to have a fancy name. It was just an outpost in a strategically important place for Ordelia territory, nothing that special, which was what made it very noticeable that it had a lot more personnel than a fort of its size should.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And while it was a decent fort that would probably hold strong against most invading enemies, at least long enough for it to send out messengers for reinforcements, it wasn’t prepared for someone who could warp with a thought like Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So why do they have a fort this far north anyways?” Kronya asked while slitting the throat of one of the guards on the wall, glancing over at Shez, “Wouldn’t they want their defenses pointed at the empire?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, but you never know who could get around them,” Shez replied, weaving around the defenders and cutting or stabbing straight through them once she saw any openings, “And besides, Leicester’s full of backbiting nobles. Putting a fort pointed towards their neighbors is just smart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Good to know.” With that, she stabbed another guy in the eye, before flipping over him and stabbing her tails through the set of guards trying to cut down Shez, ending the fight with three bloody impalements.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There we go." Leaning out over the wall, Shez waved over to where the rest of the group was, before tossing the rope ladder she was given so they could climb up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, I saw that you hugged Lysithea," Kronya commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...uh, yeah. Is now the time to talk about that?" Shez asked, glancing over towards the group approaching. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I figure while we have some privacy. Look, I'm not going to say some stupid shit like it's me or her, I just want to know if you like me like you like her." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…well, I dunno. Honestly, I didn't think I'd ever get to meet up with any of you guys again, let alone anyone else, so…I just never really thought about that stuff," Shez looked away, a bit embarrassed, "But…I do want to spend more time with you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm," Kronya frowned for a moment, before nodding, "Fine, you belong to me, and she belongs to you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “Uh…hang on, what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It works perfectly, like a natural hierarchy. I am on the top, you are beneath me, and she is beneath you. I don’t have to touch her, and yet it stays stable.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...that’s not how relationships work. Also why would you be on the top?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because I have more kills than you,” Kronya stated with a teasing tone as she promptly stabbed her tails through the faces of three guards who’d gotten into her range. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wha– Hey that's not fair!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Heh, not my fault you're so slow," Kronya teased as Leonie exited the gatehouse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright you two, stop flirting. I’ve got the gate open, everybody else should be pushing in now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re not–Wait, shit, right!” Shez quickly broke off from Kronya, earning a small pout from the Agarthan, and leapt from the wall to join with the main force assaulting the fort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Plenty of black-clad soldiers stood in their way, but with Lorenz’s cavalry and Claude’s support from the air, the enemy soon found their defenses breaking down in a bloody slaughter. Not that the Deer actually wanted it to be a full slaughter; the problem was, none of the enemy Agarthans were willing to surrender.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Glory to Agartha!" A mage yelled, attempting to cast a miasma on Shez while her back was turned only to receive an arrow to the arm. Screaming out in pain, he lifted his other arm to try and cast again, only for his arm to get lopped off as Shez spun around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah, glory to whatever,” Shez complained, irritated, “Now how about you–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At that exact moment, darkness burst out from the mage, a pair of glowing “eyes” marking a Death Γ that the Agarthan cast on himself. As one might expect, he immediately dropped down dead, earning a grimace from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well shit, that’s…inconvenient,” she muttered, before shaking it off and trying to get back into the fight. She just needed to take one alive so she could rip their heart out and…</span>
  <em>
    <span>Eesh, that’s a gruesome thought. Could I really tear out someone’s–No, stop, don’t think about that! Think of it as getting Byleth back! You’ve killed hundreds, getting squeamish now is stupid! Just focus!</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she promptly did exactly that, getting fully focused on the task at hand and cutting down everyone in the way between her and her friends taking the outpost! It’s just that she only wound up realizing that she’d already killed every Agarthan present after they’d taken the base. Herself and Kronya excepted, of course.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“....ah, dammit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Huffing, she wiped some blood off her face before she marched back to her friends, who didn't seem to have much luck either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Jeez, these guys seem to care more about what's going on than that Bias bitch," Shez muttered while Kronya pulled her dagger out of a corpse on the floor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well in that case, I guess you'll be using Bias to save the professor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Assuming she doesn't fight to the death to spite you," Lysithea pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, she would…I’m not sure why these guys are so set on dying for their cause anyway. You’d think some of them would have self-preservation,” Shez remarked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You weren’t raised in Shambhala,” Kronya pointed out, “I wouldn’t be surprised if Myson or Cleobulus have been telling them to die before allowing themselves to be captured.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. It sounds like the lower ranks are more zealous about their ‘cause’ than their leaders,” Lysithea noted, which got Kronya to immediately shake her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, the leaders are just as zealous. Everyone in Shambhala is raised to hate the Fell Star and see the people of Fodlan as beasts and vermin. You could probably make the servants surrender, if just because they weren’t built for fighting, but the minions will fight ‘til they die, and the leaders will just run away while ordering everyone else to die for them." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, as long as we can get one of them, I don't care who we get," Shez huffed, before turning to Lysithea, "So, any idea on how this fort connects to the castle?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I've never been down here, but…" Lysithea frowned, as she remembered unpleasant memories, "...There's probably something in the dungeons, if it's anything like the castle." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh?” Claude glanced over, "Did our young mage spend a lot of time playing down there?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yeah, playing, sure." She shook off whatever thoughts were going through her head, focusing again. “Let’s go investigate. We need to hurry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey Claude, bit of advice," Shez said, slinging an arm around his shoulder as Lysithea began to lead the forces to the dungeon, "Don't tease her about this stuff, got it?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…sounds like there’s a story there,” he commented, which earned a frown from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t poke at her either. If she wants to tell you, she’ll tell you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Knowing her, that means I’ll never get to hear what her story is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then just deal with that. You don’t need to know everything,” Shez said, before glancing up as Lorenz called out from ahead of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ve found a hidden passageway!" Waving them over, Lorenz stood by a wall that had shifted open, stretching out into the darkness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alright, so who's going in first?" Leonie asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh? Why don't we all go?" Kronya asked in return. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Because we need to ensure this does connect to the castle. As such a vanguard will go in and see where it leads, before returning for the rest of us so we can synchronize our attack with my father's forces,” Lorenz explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Which is why I am going,” Lysithea spoke up, “I'm the one that's most aware of Castle Ordelia’s layout, so I will be able to tell if we do end up there."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In that case, I'm going too! We might end up catching an Agarthan or two off guard enough that I can actually grab one," Shez said, volunteering after Lysithea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then I'm going too, since I'm the top," Kronya stated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The what?” Leonie asked while Ignatz noticeably stiffened beside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-Ah, I don’t think that’s an entirely appropriate topic right now, Emily–Ah, Kronya-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So what are you even on top of?” Leonie questioned, ignoring him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The hierarchy, duh. I’m on top, Shez is in the middle, Lysithea is below her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s inane,” Lysithea remarked, exasperated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed,” Lorenz agreed, nodding, “Of the three of you, Lysithea is from a major noble household–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I already renounced my title." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes, I am simply saying even a former noble has a higher standing than those who never were. No offense intended, of course." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, this is getting–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then make me a noble," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Excuse me?" Lorenz asked, a bit surprised by Kronya's demand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You can do that right? Ennobling me, that's the word right?" Kronya asked, before thinking. "Actually, since Lysithea isn't keeping her castle, I can have it right?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?!” Lysithea practically screeched, “You–Are you seriously trying to take my home right after we get it back?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…yeah? You don’t want it, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I–Y-You still can’t just take it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Give it to me then.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not doing that!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"See Shez? This is why I'm clearly the better option, she doesn't even want to give us her castle." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. "Wait, why am I getting involved?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good question. Here’s a better one,” Claude said as he poked his head out from the passageway, “Why are you chatting when we should be investigating?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Good point.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, a squad of Deer promptly entered the tunnel presumably leading towards Castle Ordelia, with Shez taking the lead. Lysithea came with her, of course, which meant Leonie and Kronya had to come with, the former because Lysithea was still her employer while the latter was insistent on getting her castle, and Lorenz insisted on leading the squad, so Ignatz came along too. And of course, Claude was already in the passageway to begin with so…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>…Hang on…didn’t we just wind up bringing everyone? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shez wondered to herself while holding up a torch to light the way. As she questioned this, Shez kept looking forward, her eyes and the marks on her skin glowing in the darkness of the tunnel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Based on the direction, it seems we truly are going towards the castle. We'll likely end up needing to time our assault with the outside forces to catch those inside off guard completely," Lysithea said as she walked beside Shez, her voice carrying through the tunnel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that so?" came a voice up ahead of them, making the group stiffen while Shez summoned her sword in her free hand, getting ready to fight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her grip on her sword tightened once she registered the familiar sight of a bird-masked mage dressed in red. "What are you doing down here?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please, once I got a report that the fort was getting assaulted, it was more than obvious what you were planning," Bias taunted, flanked by two guards in black armor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And you came down with only two guys? Seems kinda dumb to me," Claude pointed out, bow at the ready and an arrow in hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh yes, because bringing a large group into an enclosed space is such a good idea. Especially in a tunnel that could collapse from a single explosion," Bias retorted, a ball of flame forming in her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That would kill you too!” Leonie shouted, though it just earned a chuckle from the Agarthan mage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then I’ll just have to be careful, now won’t I?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. Then we shall simply have to–” Lorenz began, before pausing when Kronya darted past him, “Wha–Wait–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But the Agarthan assassin didn’t listen, instead using her tails to spring forward so she could plunge her dagger straight into Bias’s chest. Unfortunately for her though, one of the knights stepped in the way, catching her blade on his shield and shoving her back, though she landed on her feet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well would you look at that…” Bias murmured, pushing past the knight that just saved her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–Lady Bias, you shouldn’t–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up. So you’re still alive, puppy. I thought for sure you would have gone down trying to kill your way out of the monastery.” The sage removed her mask, letting Kronya see her smile and the other Deer see her burns. “I have to say…I’m glad I was wrong.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why's that? Did you want to kill me yourself?” Kronya questioned, glaring at her former superior.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s a cruel thing to ask. Though…if it came down to it, I really might have. That professor of yours, the Fell Star…I was planning to use you as a hostage against her. But then, I planned a lot of things.” Bias tilted her head. “And now you’ve joined up with the broken vessel. So I have to ask…what exactly are you two planning?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why would I tell you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Think of it as catching up. After all, we did work together for some months. If I'm being sentimental I will admit I enjoyed your company more than I do those at the castle." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you're feeling that kind, then you better surrender. It would make taking you alive a lot easier," Shez said, not lowering her guard as her eyes stayed on Bias. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? You need me alive?" Bias seemed to think for a moment. "Fishing for information are you? Or do you think taking me hostage would make Myson falter?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if we need that! Besides, your two lackeys here will work just as well!" Kronya shouted, ready to strike. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They would?" Bias seemed to pause, the gears in her head turning, "...You want to perform the forbidden spell." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–“ Kronya glanced at Shez, unintentionally confirming things for Bias.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So that’s it then…are you hoping you can get the Fell Star back? You know it’s a one way trip, don’t you? No one ever escapes the void of Zahras.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not even the one who created it?" Shez asked, glaring at Bias. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Bias's lips twitched, "So you've accepted his power? Or perhaps you tore it out of his hands? Do you truly think you can do what the Fell Star or her spawn can't?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Only one way to find out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Silence fell upon those in the tunnel. No one said a word as Shez and Bias locked eyes, instead just waiting for what signal would set off the building sense of impending violence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seeing her lips twitch again, Shez prepared herself for whatever condemnation Bias was about to say. How she was being idiotic, that she might as well die to save herself the time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What she didn't expect was for Bias to begin cackling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her laughter echoed out all around them, bouncing off the walls of the tunnel, manic and loud. Nobody made a move. They just stared at the cackling sage who had just completely dropped her thin veneer of sanity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then the laughter finally petered off, and Shez felt herself tense when Bias grinned at her. “That…I like that. That’s a good attitude to have.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She straightened, her grin still wide. “I’ll see you at the castle. You’d better give me a good show.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, Lady Bias, shouldn’t we–“ one of the knights began to say, before Bias quite casually put a hand on his chest and caused him to burst into flames.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sudden blaze made everyone stumble back, caught off guard by the bright flames and sharp smell of boiling metal. The knight didn’t even have a chance to scream before smoke filled the tunnel, obscuring their sight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Try not to suffocate!” Bias called back to them, her voice taunting, “And enjoy your practice dummy!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A thud caught Shez’s attention, making her glance down to see the second knight unconscious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And make sure to give your sister my regards~!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, what in the world is she talking–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No time!” Claude interrupted, speaking over Lorenz and sounding uncharacteristically serious, “We need to get out of here before that smoke chokes us!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, good point–Everyone, retreat! We need to let the tunnels clear before we–Kh-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop talking in the smoke!” Leonie ordered, before grabbing Lorenz by the back of his armor and pulling him back with the rest of the retreating Deer, all while Shez found herself staring at the armored Agarthan on the ground in front of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...right. Figure it out afterward,” she muttered to herself, before grabbing the knight and hoisting them up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t that difficult to carry the Agarthan, so Shez wasn’t sure where this strange, heavy feeling was coming from…</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“So, getting Teach back involves ripping out this guy’s heart, huh?” Claude asked, summing up Shez’s past few minutes of attempting to explain just why she needed to take an Agarthan prisoner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Pretty much. I don't know if this plan will work, but it's my best shot at saving Byleth," Shez responded, staring into the cell they had tossed the unconscious prisoner in, "And the sooner, the better." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see. And the guy needs to be alive for it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...yeah.” Shez shrugged. “It’s not like I haven’t killed people before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, when are we going?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We? Who said you're going too?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well the last time you disappeared, you were gone for three years, and it wouldn't hurt to have Teach owe me one," Claude said, a smirk on his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And the people here are going to need every person they have to take the castle back, since I doubt Bias is just gonna twiddle her thumbs after what happened." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t that a better argument for why you should put off going to grab Teach until after we take the castle?” Claude raised his hands when Shez immediately glared at him. “I’m just saying, it might be good to handle the big threat first. Teach can wait a little longer for rescue, can’t she?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Shez sighed. "I get that. I just…I need to make sure she's okay. She's been stuck in that place for so long that I don't even…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s up to you. You’re the only one that can cast this spell, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I have to use it on myself. I, ah…I don’t know how well this is going to work. I’ve got my mom’s notes and I’ve got the memories of what that asshole did to make it work.” She took a breath, before nodding. “So no more waiting. I just have to go right ahead and, ah…crush this guy’s heart. In my hand. After tearing it out of his chest…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Are you sure you have to rip it out with your bare hand?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…I mean, technically I just have to be holding the heart, I guess I could just…plunge my hand into his chest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. Well, I guess it’s good he’s still unconscious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Honestly, that kind of makes it worse. At least if he was awake, he could fight–No, no, that’s actually worse, that…ugh, why am I getting weird about this? I just need to punch into a guy’s chest, it’s not that difficult.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude raised an eyebrow. “It’s not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It shouldn’t be! I might not have done it before, but–Wait, should I have practiced this? Would it be weird if I practiced?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...on who?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...good question. Okay, uh…” Shez took a breath, staring at the unconscious Agarthan man. “I guess I’m doing this. Do you think you could grab Lysithea and Kronya real quick? I know they’re helping with the whole ‘on fire tunnel’ thing, but they should probably be here for this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, if you want. Just don’t use this as an excuse to go there on your own.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez frowned. “I’m not gonna do that. No running off on my own, I know that much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, I’m holding you to that. I might actually make you pay a fine if you do go off on your own.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m a duke now, I can absolutely do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, Claude headed off, leaving Shez alone for a moment as she glanced over at their Agarthan prisoner. Which she still felt pretty weird about. Like, sure, the guy was working for Bias, and considering how most Agarthans were, he was probably the type to consider everyone around him horrible beasts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But then…Kronya had been like that, hadn’t she?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why does this bother me? I can kill tons of people without hesitating, I have a lot of blood on my hands, but now that I have a chance to save my sister, I start getting squeamish? What the hell is that?</span>
  </em>
  <span> she mentally berated herself, starting to scowl, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I just need to get this over with. No more hesitating, no more waiting. Just…don’t think about it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stepped forward, flexing her hand. The Agartha’s outer armor had been removed, so there was only a tunic in between her and his chest. If she just used some dark magic to make it easier to push through…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...damn it,” she muttered, turning away, “I…I’ll just wait for the oth–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This is why you need me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stiffened. The sound of that far too familiar voice sent a cold sweat down her back, her eyes darting around the cell to try to spot–And then she went fully rigid, though not because of the tension she felt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was because someone else was in her body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You need me to do what needs to be done. I see that now. And you will too, once we are finally rid of that wretched creature that consumes your thoughts,” Epimenides stated with her voice, before he turned and plunged their hand straight into the chest of the captive Agarthan without hesitation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then all was darkness.</span>

  <p>
  <span>Byleth wasn’t sure how or why, exactly, but the void that surrounded her at all times of the day seemed to have…changed. Not immediately, it was a process so gradual she barely noticed, but it seemed to have gone from an endless expanse of darkness to more like a night sky. There were stars and strange stretches of color across the sky that Rhea called “nebulae” when Byleth asked what they were, which didn’t make sense at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not the “nebula” things, she could understand what those were since they were basically just void clouds, but the stars. She didn’t understand how those could be here since they weren’t anywhere there should be stars. Right?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s just weird,” Byleth commented while laying back and staring up at the distant lights, “This place is supposed to be empty. Why would there be stars?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…presumably, Zahras is merely a part of the greater void that forms our night sky,” Rhea considered, also watching the distant stars, “That, or…perhaps they are false stars, gathered in this place for one reason or another.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...could you touch them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stars are lights in the sky, aren’t they? So couldn’t you fly up and touch them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stars are far greater than that, Byleth. Each one in a sun in their own right, merely distant from us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked, then sat up, giving Rhea a skeptical look. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, truly. My mother came from one of those distant stars, in fact. Though…this night sky does not match our own, so I cannot point it out to you." Rhea reached a hand up into the sky. "Sometimes I wonder what the world mother came from was like, what could have made her leave hers and journey all alone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...If Sothis never said anything, then she was happier here, at least," Byleth said, laying back down, "And we have to make sure her home stays safe." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Yes, we do," Rhea responded, finding herself smiling for some reason, "Though I'm sure whatever you do, she'd be proud of you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm…I'm sure she'd be proud of you too, even if she would have had her complaints." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"There is no need to comfort me but…thank you, Byleth." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that the two sat in a comfortable silence.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Child, might I ask a favor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? What about?" Byleth asked, glancing over from where she was soaking in the bath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can you please stop leaving your…dolls near the bath?” Rhea requested, also in the middle of bathing, though she was keeping her knees close to her chest in an attempt at modesty, “It is awkward having them stare at me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I like bathing with them though." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You understand how I might find that concerning, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, not in the slightest,” Byleth replied, “You can just turn them around if you don’t like them watching you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Child, that…” Rhea paused. “Do you like it when they watch you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When it’s Edelgard and Dorothea, yeah. I’m not keeping the rest of them near the bath, that would be weird.” She tilted her head in thought. “I guess I could include Shez, we’ve bathed together before. Saves on time and water.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's not…Child, is there a specific reason why you keep Edelgard and Dorothea so close?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Well, it feels nice." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm. Byleth, did…did Jeralt not tell you about the pegasi and the wyvern?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What?" Byleth stared up at her, blinking, before her eyes widened in shock. "Rhea, no it's not a sex thing!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh! Yes, it's not, that's a good thing. Just…I understand if you need some time alone–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not talking about this with you,” she stated, getting up and walking away without bothering to dry herself off or dress, aside from grabbing her coat, “And I get plenty of time alone! Don’t make it weird!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Wait, did you mean that in the euphemistic sense–And she’s gone. Hm.” Rhea glanced at the pair of dolls perched on the side of the ‘bath’, their bodies little more than spheres perched atop cones with some small carvings to give them ‘hair’ and ‘clothes’. Still, their staring eyes, one imperious, the other mirthful, seemed fixed on her. “...this is your fault.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn't receive a response, so instead she reached over, trying to push them away, only for the Edelgard one to tip over. Rhea couldn't help but stiffen as a crack sounded out as the doll broke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Rhea, what did you break!?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t! It just–I moved and it tipped–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth gasped as she spotted the decapitated Edelgard doll. “Assassination…”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Byleth! BYLETH! Come on now, child, it’s been a month according to the tally chart! Stop hiding in these…admittedly eerie ruins!” Rhea called out, feeling a faint shiver as she took in the lines of strange light that crossed through the metallic floors. They reminded her of an age she really didn’t want to recall…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So it seems even the great Archbishop feels fear," a…strangely sing-songy yet still monotone voice called out, "I wonder if she knows Edie also felt this when she was assassinated." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Byleth, I know that's you. You're horrible at mimicking voices." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea wondered if Byleth would say something, only to feel a rock hit her head. "...Did you just throw a rock at me???" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's what you get for not playing along!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would I play a–...” Rhea let out a slow, aggravated sigh when she noticed the number of small, stone ‘knights’ arranged in an army at about shin height. “...did you individually carve all of these?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Obviously. I only have one knife and you’re not helpful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That is impressive, but also I feel as though the isolation is getting to you, Byleth–” She promptly ducked another rock. “STOP DOING THAT!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Empire of Bylethia shall not bow to draconic tyranny!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea stared, somewhat stunned, as Byleth began to let out low cheers and yells, as if trying to mimic an army roaring before a battle. “...You understand this is absurd, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you understand that a large, stationary target is easily struck by catapults.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that what the rocks are supposed to–” She caught the next rock and promptly pitched it back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! Missed!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...tch.” Rhea narrowed her eyes, before grabbing one of the stone soldiers and pitching it in the direction of Byleth’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard a faint yelp, followed by a laugh. “Ah, so you begin your assault! I knew you treacherous hounds of Seirosia would attack us!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seirosia? No, never mind.” Rhea sighed, rubbing her temples. “Byleth, this is absurd. Not only are you waging a war with stone toys, you were the one who attacked first.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And yet you were the one to counter-attack! Making you the true aggressor!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What am I doing?” Rhea murmured, before simply walking through the stone knights, who couldn’t really do anything to stop her on account of being dolls made out of rocks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So I see the tyrant of Seirosia has chosen to take to the field herself! Fight valiantly men! Strike down your foe! Win glory for your people! Do your best! Earn your pay!” Byleth continued to call out, in between adding her own sound effects to the ‘battle’.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea sighed to herself, continuing to walk as she tried to find Byleth, all while knocking over dolls in her way. The sounds of 'battle' continued, now adding the cries of those who 'died' in battle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon enough however, the sounds began to peter out, until only the sound of falling dolls remained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Turning a corner, Rhea found Byleth, the young Nabatean hugging her knees to her chest. "...Byleth?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, hey, Rhea. I guess you won," Byleth muttered, continuing to stare ahead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Moving closer, Rhea sat next to her. "I'm guessing this isn't because I wasn't playing along?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I've never been alone since Shez showed up. Jeralt would do his best, but even he couldn't be around me all the time, and I only started to get close to the other mercenaries thanks to Shez," Byleth murmured, hugging her knees closer to herself. "I know you're here Rhea, but…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...There's still some distance and wariness, I imagine." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. You scared me, back at the monastery. I thought we were getting close and you would be like family too, but then you weren’t. You just wanted your mother back, and you were using me to get her.” She glanced up at Rhea. “Was any of it real? Did you care about me at all besides as a vessel for Sothis?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...It would be dishonest for me to say yes. When you were stillborn, I couldn't help but wonder if the life that was given to you was that of my mother, and you simply were unaware," Rhea admitted, unable to meet her gaze. "At best, I thought that you simply couldn't remember. At worst, I thought of you as a vessel that would disappear when mother returned. Now it just seems that my treatment of you will be another thing I shall regret for the rest of my time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Do you know how you could make up for it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea paused, then glanced curiously at the younger woman. “How?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Play along with my nonsense for a bit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So you admit it’s nonsense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well yeah, obviously. It’s fun though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea sighed, though a small smile came to her face. “Very well then, I suppose the nation of Seirosia must respond to this intense aggression from the Empire of Bylethia.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The smile she received from Byleth made it worth it. “Ah, but you fail to realize, tyrant of Seirosia, that we of Bylethia have a secret weapon!” she declared, before gesturing towards…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Is that meant to be a dragon?” Rhea asked, staring at the vaguely winged rock that looked like a cross between a snake and a bear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...yeah. You found me before I could finish it,” Byleth muttered, her cheeks turning a little pink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see. Well, your…dragon-bear-snake appears very fearsome.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...it’s just a fat dragon, it’s not part bear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, the neck would be wider if she was just fat. Also, given that the nation of Seirosia is one of draconic tyranny, clearly this marvelous creature should be on my side,” Rhea decided, getting up and picking up the stone hybrid without issue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth gasped. “Treachery! To think you would recruit one of my loyal soldiers out from under me! This deception shall not go unavenged!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, but your army could not face off against me before, how will they stand up against the combined might of my and my Stalwart general, the Unfaltering Blade of Devotion?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Though you may have a dragon, my army will not fall to you! We shall rise against your tyranny!" Byleth stated, before moving to grab her soldiers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Smiling, Rhea began to play with Byleth, the two acting out some inane story that made no sense to her. Even so…it was the first time in so long that she was able to laugh so freely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She would never be able to make up her past actions to Byleth, this she knew, but if she could make her happy, then she would. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"Hey, Rhea, what was Wilhelm like?" Byleth asked seemingly out of nowhere as she finished remaking an Edelgard doll. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, why do you ask?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Because I want to know your type,” the younger woman bluntly stated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Ah, may I ask why?" the archbishop inquired, unsure of what else to say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well I was just thinking that both Edelgard and Dorothea are kinda different, so I was wondering what my 'type' is, and I figured if I knew what someone else's was, I can help figure out my own." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is an odd line of logic, Byleth,” Rhea replied in the midst of shaping her own armored knight astride a horse. A mix of fire magic and her own natural strength made it a bit easier to mold the stone, though some of the more intricate details required using her nails. “I would think you would have an idea of who you find attractive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“See, that’s the issue. I think everyone’s attractive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...truly?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, everyone I’ve met has qualities that make them interesting and in terms of physical appearance, I’m pretty sure I like just about everything. My family members obviously aren’t, because that would be gross, and people like the mercenaries I grew up with and Alois are also just not appealing in a romantic sense, I guess because I consider them family, but everyone else is pretty attractive to me.” She paused. “...not Gilbert though. He’s not my type, I know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well he is married, so I would hope not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Him being a bad dad is a bigger turn off, really.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...’turn off’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Slang meaning that I don’t find him attractive. I think specifically it means I don’t find him sexually appealing, but I just don’t think he’d be a good partner since he abandoned his family to join the church without telling them and then refused to interact with his daughter when she came to find him.” She glanced over at Rhea, who looked alarmed. “Shez complained about it to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I see. I was unaware of such an issue. I must admit if I had learned about this before, I likely wouldn't have said anything other than it being honorable to choose the church in such a circumstance. Nowadays…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. So as I was saying, he's a no," Byleth continued before pausing, "...I guess anyone of Ashe's age or younger is a no as well. Age difference and all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then I'm afraid I can't comment at all. I am over a thousand years old, after all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth put down her doll and walked over to Rhea to give her a hug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...um, Byleth, while I appreciate the hug, I am not sure why you’re hugging me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because no one else is over a thousand years old and I think it’s sad that you’re going to be alone forever.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea sighed. “That…I will be honest, child, that genuinely hurt to hear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Sorry. Okay, we can change the standard for you since that limits your dating pool way too much.” She tilted her head in thought. “...what about Hanneman? He’s old.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please stop making assumptions of who I should date based on age.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, then what about Hanneman on the basis that he’s a well-educated nobleman from Adrestia? He’s also interested in crests and history, so you have stuff in common.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Byleth, why are you focusing so much on Hanneman?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Because I feel if I don't do something, he and Manuela are going to keep bickering for the rest of their lives…actually, are you interested in Manuela?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t considered her a romantic prospect, no." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you sure? She's hot." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I understand she is physically attractive. The issue, Byleth, is that I have become aware I have a number of blindspots in regards to the people of Garreg Mach due to the distance I keep from them. In spite of that, I am already well aware of her reputation as a lascivious drunk who keeps a remarkably messy room. Honestly, it's a miracle her protégé didn't end up like her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." The younger Nabatean's face went pink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Byleth?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wasn't thinking of Dorothea being like Manuela, shut up." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Byleth–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She answered the door naked one time, I can’t let myself think about Dorothea doing that.” Her face went from pink to red. “...oh no, I did that to Edelgard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up. I need to…not be here.” Byleth stood and immediately walked away, her face crimson.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Rhea let out a sigh, wondering how much longer she'd have to deal with...well, everything, really.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>"So, hypothetically speaking–"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth, if this is another awkwardly personal question, then I'll have to ask you to stop." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It wasn't. I wanted to know what you would have done if Sothis did come back and was okay with what you were planning." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…well, there wasn't much beyond that. Once the goddess had descended, then she would make her rightful claim of the land of Fodlan, and guide us forevermore." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...” Byleth gave Rhea a flat look. “Rhea, that's stupid." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? No it's not!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes it is. Ignoring everything with the Agarthans, there's still the issues with the western church thinking you're a heretic, and I don't know if people will accept a little girl being the goddess, especially if she looks nothing like the murals you have around the place." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Okay, admittedly I hadn't expected her to be a young girl, but once she shows off her divine miracles, people would know she's the goddess." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like what? No one notices when I reverse time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you can reverse time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, obviously. Did I not tell you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You certainly did not. Unless you did so before reversing time." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can't in the void. It's outside of time or something," Byleth said, uncaring of Rhea’s incredulous stare, "I figured out how to sorta stop time in here, but I can't reverse it." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I see. Well, the goddess is perfectly capable of other miracles, such as creating life. At the height of her power, mother could form worlds with a mere thought.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Neat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You don’t believe me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “Sothis is maybe ten at most in my brain and I find it hard to believe she could make a world. I know she made you, but making everything seems pretty impossible.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hmph, well, it's not my fault you didn't see her at the height of her power. And besides, she wouldn’t have looked like a child, she would have been you. Or, well…taken your body, which I do still apologize for–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine. I still find it hard to believe people could worship me as a goddess though. I’m not that impressive.” With a shrug, Byleth grabbed a rock to nibble on, "I mean I know my clothes are cute, but I don't know if they'd make me worshipable." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That…your sense of fashion aside, you would have been provided new vestments for your position." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, really? What do they look like?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah…give me some time." Rhea requested, before she began to cut out a stone slab from the floor. Nodding, Byleth sat back, before waiting approximately one tally mark as Rhea worked on carving something on the rock. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Here we are!" Rhea said, showing off the stone slab that depicted Byleth in some form of holy vestments. "Alongside this, I would have granted you the title of Enlightened One." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...why is the collar so big?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"High collars are fashionable." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Byleth squinted a bit, wondering about Rhea’s sense of fashion. "And what about the cape? It looks like it would drag on the floor."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Okay, admittedly, the vestments were originally designed with the first of my attempts in mind. Baal was surprisingly tall, compared to the rest of you." Rhea frowned a little sadly, remembering her first ‘daughter’, before she shook off the memory. “Regardless, it could be fitted to your body better–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do I get to keep my usual outfit?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would prefer it if you dressed with more…care for your station.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not dressing like a priest. I’m not even part of the church.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I suppose you aren't, but regardless, are you saying you'll wear two outfits at once?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? No, I'll just take the coat. Look, give me a bit," Byleth requested, before trying to cut out a stone slab as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Approximately three tallies and several destroyed slabs later… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Here we go!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Rhea wasn't sure what she was looking at. Was it a demonic beast? It looked vaguely humanoid, but… “Byleth, I will be perfectly honest with you, I have no idea what I am looking at.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? It’s me. Obviously.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm.” Rhea tried to study the image, hoping somehow she would be able to parse the meaning hidden in the poorly carved picture. “...why do you have horns?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Rhea, they're not horns, it's the collar of the cape," Byleth explained, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. "Do you need glasses?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Apparently,” Rhea muttered, her eyes narrowing as she tried to piece together… “Why is there a gap in the middle?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because my top doesn’t cover my midriff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Then…oh, that is meant to be your belly button then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, obviously. What did you think it was?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“An eye.” Well, at least it became easier to decipher the image with an indication of what she was supposed to be looking at. “So these are meant to be your leggings on your legs then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, the leggings you tore up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea sighed. “I apologized for that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t stop my legs from being cold.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not even cold here, the air is just…mild. I imagine a lack of heat would make this place feel colder, but somehow it’s lacking cold as well–Never mind. Byleth, I don’t think you’re particularly good at carving images into stone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Hurtful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sorry, but it's true. Still, you're good at other things. You're a fantastic teacher, for example!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph." With a pout, Byleth turned away from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth, please, we all have things we're not good at." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Name something you're bad at then." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, being the archbishop for one, apparently." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True,” Byleth readily agreed, before she paused. “Hm. Do you think you want to try a different job when we get out of here? You were bad at being archbishop, but you seem really good at stone carving.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you think I should become a stone carver?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but call yourself an ‘artisan’. It sounds more impressive and you’re more likely to get noble clients that way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm. I suppose I will keep that in mind. I never truly considered what I would do if I ever stepped down from being archbishop…do you have any other ideas for potential professions I could take up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well you have the hips to be a barmaid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Byleth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged, unrepentant. “You asked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Do all barmaids need to have a certain type of hip?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It helps. Generally speaking tavern owners and such will want someone pretty serving drinks and the like to help bring in customers. With how strong you are, they might not even have to pay to have someone guard the place in case anyone gets too drunk." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I don’t want to spend my retirement being pawed at by drunks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a suggestion, you don’t have to commit to it. Besides, the higher class places have rules about that, I think.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Regardless, I do not think the profession of ‘barmaid’ is for me. Particularly since your only reasoning appears to be based on my figure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And your strength. You have to be on your feet for a long while, serving drinks and bringing food, and like I said, you could basically be their tavern guard too. Who knows, it might be fun. You could maybe meet someone nice too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see the subject has turned back to my romantic life again…Byleth, I don't have any interest in pursuing anyone romantically. If that changes, I'll let you know, but as it stands, it's not for me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh…okay…can I still talk about romance with you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As long as you don't try to set me up with someone." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t have any plans to do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I did not accuse you of having plans, Byleth.” She frowned. “Did you have plans?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m going to go practice my stone carving,” Byleth decided, getting up and walking away as Rhea let out an exasperated sigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who were you even thinking of–No, don’t engage with her, she’ll wind up convinced you’re attracted to Dimitri again…”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Fire. Thunder. Wind–Damn it. Fire, thunder, wind–Damn it. Fire, thunder, wi–nh…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned at her hand, which was stubbornly refusing to cast a wind spell on command. She could get Fire fine, she could get Thunder fine, but she couldn’t get Wind. There was some kind of…block in place, one that she just couldn’t figure out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Practicing again?” Rhea asked while draping her freshly washed gown over the drying pole they’d set up in their sort-of-home in the void. The fact that they only had rocks around meant the pair had to get creative when it came to crafting furniture and tools, but Rhea really was surprisingly good at stone crafting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thanks to her, they had actual furniture. Albeit very hard, rocky furniture, and most of their chairs looked more like thrones. Which, thinking about it… “Do Nabateans have a thing for thrones?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I asked you a question first, Byleth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, yeah, I am. I want to figure out how to do wind spells. I feel like it’s there, I just…can’t figure it out,” she admitted, frowning, “I know the formulas for it, but it just doesn’t come to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, I would help you, but in terms of reason magic, my expertise lies with fire magic," Rhea said, moving over to sit in one of the stone thrones. "Generally speaking, having someone who knows a specific type of magic you wish to learn helps, so you would be best suited to find someone who knows wind magic when we escape." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Really? Because when Shez-...hm." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is something wrong?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, I'm just remembering I asked Shez for help with ice magic once, but…she didn't explain it well, so that wouldn't really contradict what you said. As nice as she is, I wouldn't say Shez is a good teacher." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll take your word for it," Rhea said, before stifling a chuckle, "Remember when she thought I was offering her the position of being a professor?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Considering how the year went afterwards, I almost think you should have.” Byleth paused, a small grin crossing her face. “Actually, you absolutely should have. She would have been hilarious as a professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"She probably would have charged the other two teams on her own during the mock battle." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, but then the other students wouldn't have rushed the field thinking someone was cheating." Byleth said, before snickering slightly. "Of course, she probably wouldn't have a team in the first place, since I imagine her training would have involved just beating them with a sword in a 'spar' against her."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. Well, she wouldn’t be the worst professor we ever had. That would be the fool that ran off due to the bandit attack.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s a pretty low bar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well you’re not exactly inspiring confidence in Shez’s teaching abilities.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s true. I…hm.” Byleth frowned to herself. “...hm. Have I been…You know, thinking about it, while she might have had a rough time of it at the start, I bet she would have risen to the occasion. She’s not an idiot. She’s just…she acts dumb sometimes and she has a bad sense of direction, and sometimes I need to help, but she’s strong and capable, and…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Byleth?” Rhea gave her a concerned look. “Is everything all right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...no. No, it’s not. I haven’t seen my sister in…in way too long. And I wasn’t…I was treating her like she was stupid and weak, and I didn’t think she could handle anything–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe that’s what you were doing–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was. I didn’t believe in her and she’s going to think that. She’s going to think I thought she was useless but she’s not–” Byleth took a breath, feeling a lump in her throat. “...what if I hurt her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...she knows you love her,” Rhea pointed out, frowning faintly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t get to say it though. It just…we were put in here before I could.” Byleth rubbed her eyes. "Despite everything that happened, that's the thing I want to change the most. To let her know how great she is." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Rhea moved in close, gently wrapping her arms around her, holding Byleth close. The young girl took in a shuddering breath, before she began to cry, letting her tears flow free. Rhea remained silent, gently rubbing her back, letting Byleth take as long as she needed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eventually, Rhea pulled away, as Byleth took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Thank you, Rhea." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's the least I can do." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth put on her best smile as she rubbed her eyes. "You know Rhea, I'm glad we got to know one another." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I am too. I know I can never make up for what I did, but…I hope we can be a part of each other's life from now on." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No promises, but…I'm looking forward to it," Byleth said, smiling back at her. "Grandma." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You really don't need to call me that–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A sudden crack sounded out within the void, as if space itself had been ripped open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pressing up against each other's backs, Rhea and Byleth scanned the area around them, trying to find the source of the noise. "...What was that?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Whatever it is, we need to be careful," Rhea stated, quickly moving to get dressed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure," Byleth agreed, keeping one hand on her dagger before beginning to walk with Rhea towards the source of the sound.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You don't think this is another Agarthan trick, do you?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why wait so long then?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea remained silent, unsure of the reason. Though before they went much farther, they heard a noise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ngh…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth felt her eyes widened, her now-pointed ears twitching at the strangely familiar groan. Before Rhea could stop her, she took off sprinting, her chest tightening as she ran.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Groaning, Shez pushed herself up, her head throbbing in pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"F-Fucking asshole…" she muttered, rubbing the back of her head. She grit her teeth, feeling her anger begin to boil up over how that piece of shit stole her body again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her freedom had been short-lived, and she was going to get it back one way or another. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blinking, the mercenary looked over and found her sister staring back at her. She had green hair and she wasn’t wearing her coat or her stockings, but it was her. After all this time, it was her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Byleth?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez could feel her eyes stinging as her vision began to blur. Pushing herself up, she walked towards Byleth, before stopping right in front of her. She wanted to say something, anything. But what could she say? It was her fault that Byleth was stuck here. Did she even want to see– </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Stepping in, Byleth hugged her, holding her tightly. "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for how I treated you. I love you so much." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Y-You don't need to apologize. I-I'm the one who got you stuck here." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Only because I pushed you away! You're a better sister than I deserve, and I’m so glad you’re here–” She paused, a thought occurring as she immediately started checking Shez over with a worried frown. “How did you get here? Did someone send you? Are you okay??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...pfffff–” Shez covered her mouth, trying to stifle her laughter at her sister’s sudden worry. “S-Seriously? It’s been years and you still get this worried about me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course I do,” Byleth immediately responded, before clarifying, “Not because you’re incapable, I think you’re very capable, I just…you’re my sister. And my best friend. And I…I know I should have listened to you. You were just trying to keep me safe and it wasn’t fair of me to assume I knew best. I was wrong, I am sorry, and I am so glad you’re here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked rapidly, tears gathering at her eyes as her giggling turned to a choked sob, before she wrapped her arms around Byleth and hugged her as tightly as she could, completely overwhelmed with emotion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not going to let anything happen to you again."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The two continued to hole one another, only pulling away as they heard someone running up to them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth, what happened–"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"YOU! Get away from my sister!" Shez shouted as she flashed towards Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, Shez!" Byleth called out, a moment too late as Shez buried her fist into Rhea’s face. She winced as Rhea stumbled back, almost falling before she righted herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” The archbishop pressed a hand to her bruised cheek and let out a slow sigh, before looking at Shez, who was glaring straight at her. “...I suppose I deserved that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, you did,” Shez spat, still glaring. Though she paused after Rhea’s words fully registered. “...” Then she glanced back at Byleth, taking in her sister’s somewhat awkward expression. “...ah. You two made up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Essentially,” Byleth agreed, nodding, “Though I’m sure Rhea understands why your first instinct was to punch her and won’t hold it against you. Right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea frowned at Byleth’s very pointed question. “...Yes, of course. I can accept that your sister just acted in a moment of protectiveness and won’t punch me again, please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm. As long as you don't do anything weird,” Shez agreed, matching Rhea’s frown, “Jeralt’s probably going to want to hit you if you see him though." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'll keep that in mind." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, Shez, how is papa? And everyone else?" Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused, a complicated expression crossing her face. "Ah…I, uh…I haven't seen Jeralt in a few years, but he's apparently in the Empire." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth’s brow furrowed in worry. “You haven’t? Did something happen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Some stuff, yeah. I'll tell you everything when we get out. I just need to deal with an asshole first." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You truly are such an ungrateful child.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stiffened, before immediately drawing her sword and glaring at the figure floating above them. “And you’re still a piece of shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Epimenides scoffed, his gaze contemptuous as he looked down upon his corrupted vessel and the foul creatures that invaded his world. “Mock me all you wish, </span>
  <em>
    <span>partner</span>
  </em>
  <span>, for this is the day I reclaim you as my vessel. The modicum of freedom I have allowed you was far too much, and it was foolish of me to allow you to live in anything other than a despair so crushing that you could not resist me. So now I shall rectify my past errors. No more half-measures like this foolish exile. Now, I shall put to right what I should have long ago.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His eyes burned bright in the void, fiery and contemptuous as darkness gathered at his hands. “Today is the day the Fell Star dies!”</span>

  <p>
  <span>Byleth couldn't help but frown, well aware that she was only armed with a dagger right now while she faced off against a mage that wanted her dead. It didn't help that she had left her coat behind in her hurry. "So, this is Epimenides, huh?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t quite sure how she expected him to look, but he seemed a lot younger than she would have thought. Almost like Sothis, in that sense, though where the goddess had been colorful and almost soft in appearance–even if she would’ve been really annoyed to hear Byleth describe her like that–Epimenides was stark white aside from his gleaming, fiery crown, halo, and wings, and every bit of him seemed sharp and angular. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That, and there was no hint of the kindness Sothis could carry in her gaze. The only thing showing in the sage’s eyes was a cold contempt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that’s him. He’s a prick,” Shez noted, glowering at the wraith that possessed her, while Rhea’s eyes widened in recognition.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That mage…the same one from the war against Nemesis? But how?! I slew him myself!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Epimenides scoffed, the sound echoing through Zahras. “You arrogant abomination. Do you truly think your monstrous powers could put an end to my existence?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How about your powers ending you?" Shez asked, glaring at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Tch. You would side with the spawn of that abomination?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That really shouldn't surprise you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shez, I'm going to need a full explanation later, but for now I think we have someone we need to deal with," Rhea muttered, cracking her knuckles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You read my mind. Gotta say, I like you a lot better when you want to kill the same person I want to kill.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is a surprisingly efficient way of bonding people together,” Byleth remarked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You speak of bonds, filth?” Epimenides scoffed, “Then let us see how much these ‘bonds’ of yours matter to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, he spread his arms and let loose a massive torrent of darkness that consumed their surroundings. Bracing themselves, the trio felt the darkness wash over them, before they found themselves elsewhere within the void. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay, be ready for whatever shit he has planned. The sooner we take him out, the better." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't suppose you have a spare sword I can use?" Byleth asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure, just don't break it." Shez said, tossing her red blade at Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thanks. Rhea, do you want my dagger?" Byleth offered, glancing at the older woman. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No, I think I would prefer to use my hands for this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Remind me not to get on your bad side," Shez muttered, as the three of them looked around. "Hm, don't tell me he ran away." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What, like you did?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez opened her mouth, ready to retort, only to stop as she saw who spoke. "Lysithea?! What are you doing here!?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you think? I’m getting dragged into another mess because of you!” Lysithea snapped, glaring straight at Shez with a lot more venom than she’d ever seen on the former noble’s face, “You always do this! You rush off and get everyone hurt because of it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–No I don’t!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you do! Who can forget how you abandoned all of us for three years, huh!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez flinched, genuinely hurt. “You know I didn’t–It wasn’t my fault!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course it was! It always–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Byleth stepped in front of Shez, a frown on her face. “Stop it, Lysithea. Shez isn’t at fault here. She was brought into the void by Epimenides.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Is that why you left?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth felt her throat tighten. She turned her head, her eyes widening as she saw a familiar brown haired girl, dressed in a dancer’s outfit. "D-Dorothea?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You left without saying a word, we had no idea what happened to you," the songstress said, taking a step towards Byleth. "All this time…you were stuck here because of Shez." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What? N-No, it wasn't her fault," Byleth denied, moving towards the songstress. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey, Byleth wait–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't think you're off the hook!" Lysithea shouted, getting Shez to flinch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I’m not saying that, I just–This doesn’t make sense, how are you here? And why’s Dorothea dressed like that??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-How are you even here? Where is Edelgard?" Byleth asked, looking around, though her words earned a frown from Dorothea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course you ask about her, rather than focus on me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Dorothea? What are you talking about?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Byleth, Shez, something clearly isn't right, this is a ploy–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Much like your ploy to resurrect the goddess?" Seteth asked, standing behind Rhea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Excuse me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't try to hide it, Immaculate One. I am well aware of your plots. Even now you still plan to do so, do you not?" He regarded her with open contempt. “You have always–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both Shez and Byleth jolted at the sound of a fist smashing through a head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–Rhea, what the fu–?!” Shez exclaimed, before blinking as ‘Seteth’ dissolved into darkness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He called me ‘Immaculate One’,” Rhea remarked, glaring over at ‘Lysithea’ and ‘Dorothea’. “We do not refer to each other by our Nabatean names.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Th-That’s insane! You can’t believe her!” Dorothea protested, “She just murdered him on a whim!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s a monster!” Lysithea insisted, gathering magic in her hands, “You know she’s a monster, and she needs to die right now!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hang on, that’s bullshit!” Shez snapped, “I know Lysithea isn't blind enough to miss that fake Seteth literally just melted!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You really should learn to shut up already, Shez!” Lysithea snapped, raising a hand and raining orbs of mire on the battlefield, “No one wants to hear the stupid drivel that pours out of your empty head!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Okay you're just being a giant asshole, Epimenides!" Shez shouted as she flashed away to dodge the mire orbs. Byleth, meanwhile, did her best to block a sudden stab from Dorothea as the songstress formed a Levin sword in her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh Bylie, why did you have to leave us like that?” she asked, her voice sad enough to send a pang through Byleth’s heart, “You really hurt everyone. Do you really think you deserve to live after shattering our hearts?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"..." Her mouth set into a frown, Byleth tried to keep her focus up as she stared the songstress down. "...Dorothea, what did we do that time we all went to town together?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you really trying to appeal to the old days?” she questioned, glaring at Byleth, "Talking about haircuts and sweets won't win me over!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...I'm really glad i never told Shez everything that happened there." Taking in a deep breath, Byleth steadied herself. "I'll make sure to apologize to you when I see you again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then in one swift motion, she batted away a swing from Dorothea and cut straight through the false version of her student, splitting her head from her neck. The sight still made her grimace uncomfortably, but she did feel a slight sense of relief as the songstress burst into shadowy magic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the meantime, Shez actually had a pretty easy time just flashing straight over to Fauxsithea and cutting her down, deliberately striking fast and hard so the fake would “die” quickly and she wouldn’t have to watch whatever show the sage would’ve put on otherwise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To think you would so willingly murder your closest allies. You truly are nothing more than beasts!" Epimenides taunted, his voice echoing out around them as the area around them distorted again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great, more rocks,” Shez complained, a little annoyed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How do you think I felt?” Byleth muttered, before pausing as she looked around, “Hm…I feel like I actually spent some time here. That pillar looks familiar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it a pillar if it’s made out of rock?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I realized how stupid that sounded the second I said it. I meant if it’s naturally formed, not–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pay attention, both of you,” Rhea ordered, glowering out at the darkness, “Be ready for anything. He’s bound to create more facsimiles of those we care for in an attempt to make us waver.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Understood,” Byleth murmured as she brought Shez’s sword up, ready for whatever came next. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Shez herself glared up at the void, "I'm getting real sick of your shit Epimenides!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't think it's over yet, partner,” his called out, echoing in the darkness around them, before shadows surged forth once more as faceless soldiers began to form. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Does he mean to wear us down now that his trick has been discovered?" Rhea asked, swiftly moving through her opponents, knocking their heads off with full force. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I doubt it, he's probably just biding his time!" Shez answered, making quick work of the shadowy soldiers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just try to keep an eye out for him. The sooner we find him, the better," Byleth instructed, sending an Aura through a group of soldiers, before turning in her heel to slice someone behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Professor!?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Only to hesitate for a moment as she saw Edelgard staring back at her, though the surprise on the Emperor's face suddenly changed into a smirk right before she rammed into Byleth with her shield. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth grimaced at the sudden impact, stumbling backward for a moment, though she quickly found her feet in time to avoid an arrow that nearly went through her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stay still, Teach!” Claude called out, another arrow drawn back on his bow as his white wyvern flew above the chaos, “Things will go easier for everyone if you just lay down and die!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth didn’t actually register his words though, instead staring in some confusion as she casually deflected another arrow with her sword. “Claude has a wyvern?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s a new thing!” Shez yelled, cutting through some shades before leaping to land by Byleth, “Gotta say though, I’m kinda confused by Edelgard showing up in her school uniform.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. These shades are made by Epimenides, aren’t they? So he has to go by what he already knows. He can’t make a shade that reflects someone he hasn’t encountered before and he can’t adjust to changes he doesn’t know about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Huh, guess that's why Dorothea was in that dancer outfit, it would be too obvious if she was in a uniform,” Shez muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm." Frowning, Byleth dodged a shield charge from Edelgard, before blocking an axe swing. "If Claude and Edelgard are here, that leaves…"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Grabbing Byleth, Shez warped away as a spear went flying through where they had stood, burying itself into a wall. “Yeah, I was wondering when he’d show up too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Running away again, Shez?” Dimitri growled, glaring at them both as another spear formed in his hand, “You abandoned all of us, and then you were too much of a coward to show your face!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know it’s you, Epi,” Shez said with a frown, “If you’re trying to guilt me for not saying hi to the Lions in that forest, I’m gonna have to remind you that you said you’d murder all of my friends the moment I tried to contact them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Liar!” Dimitri snapped, snarling, “You betrayed all of us! You abandoned your friends just because things would be too difficult for you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...is this about me transferring classes??” she asked, baffled, “Alright, that’s just stupid! I left because…well, a lot of reasons, but it’s not like I didn’t want to stay friends! It’s just…things happened!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You abandoned all of us when we needed you. When you could have–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ignore him,” Byleth ordered, keeping her eyes on Edelgard, who regarded her professor with a cold glare, “He’ll say anything to hurt you. Arguing it just gives him more ammunition.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Always so clever, aren’t you, professor?” Edelgard remarked, beginning to circle Byleth and Shez. Across from her, Dimitri began to do the same, the two royals keeping their eyes on the sisters. “That cleverness so often gets you into trouble though. Shez may have abandoned her friends, but if you had your way, you would have eagerly left her behind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t. She’s my sister and I love her. I was being protective and stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What was that about not arguing?” Shez asked, though a part of her felt warm at Byleth’s affirmation, “Don’t put yourself down either. I know you’re smart.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks.” Byleth took a breath, watching Edelgard, before she lightly nudged Shez with her elbow. Shez nodded, slowly and near imperceptibly, in response, her own eyes focused on Dimitri.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then the two sisters promptly turned and charged at the opposite house leader, with Byleth dodging a stab from Dimitri and ramming her sword straight through his chest while Shez fully leapt over Edelgard, a quick slice cutting the princess’s head off before she could even react. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both shades fell and dissolved into shadow as Byleth and Shez turned to give each other a quick high five, before facing off against Claude, who still circled far above them. Finally, his wyvern began to swoop down, flames filling its mouth while Claude drew back an arrow–Then he and the wyvern promptly exploded when a very large fireball collided with him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, Rhea,” Byleth noted, turning to the archbishop in question and giving her a wave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I didn’t think the shades bled that much,” Shez murmured, staring at the purple blood staining Rhea’s fists while a number of shadowy bodies lay crumpled on the ground around her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I find most things bleed heavily if you hit them hard enough,” Rhea noted, idly cleaning her hands off with a scrap of her dress.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I gotta remember you’re Byleth’s grandma.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea blinked. “Er…what?”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean, I guess that means you’re mine by extension, which does make it weird,” Shez mused, tilting her head in thought, though she paused when the void around them shifted again, “Oh damn it all, are you really trying this trick a third time!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course he is. He doesn’t seem very imaginative,” Byleth commented, keeping her sword at the ready as she stayed close to Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you demand imagination, then far be it from me to deny you,” the voice of the sage echoed out through the dark, before the two sisters found themselves in another new location.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, wait, where’s Rhea?” Shez asked, immediately noticing the archbishop wasn’t there with them…right before she noticed what Epimenides had done. “...oh you piece of shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah. That’s…That’s really cruel,” Byleth murmured, staring at the figure of her father, Jeralt, who looked at his daughters with a disapproving glare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, let out an irritated huff as she saw Rhea standing there, all dressed up in her saint gear and wielding an all too familiar sword and shield. “Is this because I called her hot? Because that’s a dick move if so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You called her what?” Byleth asked, raising an eyebrow as Shez stiffened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I, uh…L-Look, I say stupid stuff sometimes, you already knew–” Then Shez jerked back, dodging the thrust of her father’s spear. “Gh–Gonna fucking kill that asshole–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth, meanwhile, took a breath as she faced off against Rhea, who readied her sword. “...Well, at least I’ll get to work through some things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What a selfish child you are,” the fake intoned, beginning to circle Byleth as she did the same, “You killed your own mother to enter this world and stole mine to maintain your wretched, empty life. You were broken from the very moment I first laid eyes on you, you disgusting creature.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was a mistake to take you in,” Jeralt growled, stabbing forward as he stalked towards his adoptive daughter, “Everything went wrong the moment I let a parasite like you into my camp. How many times did you nearly kill Byleth? You were a worthless screw-up from the start, worming your way in as though you belonged.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah? Well I belong there more than you do, Epi,” Shez taunted, deflecting each stab and glaring into the eyes of the thing that wore her dad’s face, “What are you even supposed to be, huh? The ghost of some long dead fuck-up who couldn’t cut it a thousand years ago? Everything that you fought for is </span>
  <em>
    <span>gone</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the world doesn’t want you around!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth struck, deliberate yet forceful, watching Rhea’s every movement as the archbishop clashed blades with her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have no right to the power you’ve stolen!” the saint sneered, using her shield to catch the professor’s strikes, “My mother is dead because of you! The world would be at peace if you just surrendered this empty existence you call a life! But no, instead you are an abomination worse than any other!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You Agarthans really like that word, abomination,” Byleth noted, before raising her free hand and causing a sudden flash of light that made Rhea stumble back with a yelp of pain as she was blinded. A yelp that cut off with a sudden choke when Byleth stabbed straight through her chest. “...For what it’s worth, I don’t think I’m really angry at the real you. Even with everything…I don’t know. I guess…you still feel like family.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re no family of mine,” Jeralt snarled, swinging the spear in a wide arc, keeping Shez at a distance, “You’re just a leech, feeding off of everyone you get attached to! How many people are dead because you insisted on getting close to them!? Even your own mother died because of you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You really don’t know shit, do you?” Shez muttered, before vanishing from view.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt whirled, swinging behind himself, before pausing when he realized Shez wasn’t–And then a white sword drove straight into his head as Shez leapt from the top of the pillar she’d warped to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The constructs melted into shadow again and the sisters smiled at each other from their place on the field…only to pause as they realized they weren’t alone as the field shifted again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stared at Byleth, who stared at Shez. Or at least, the Shez next to her, just as there was another Byleth beside Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh this is going to make my head hurt,” Shez muttered, before pausing, “Wait, I don’t have to fight the other Byleth, I just have to fight my–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she promptly raised her sword to block her doppelganger’s strike, the copy apparently having the exact same idea that she had.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth, meanwhile, launched a ball of light that collided with the fireball her copy cast, before the pair clashed swords as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She was right, you know,” the false Byleth murmured, staring dully into her counterpart’s eyes, “You are an empty shell. You knew it from the beginning. Even these emotions you think you feel now are just your way of aping those around you. You pretend to be happy, angry, sad, just so you can fit in. None of it is real. You’ll never feel anything. You can’t love anyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth didn’t have a moment to take a breath, not in a fight to the death. She’d always been good at thinking in the middle of a battle though. “Do I really look like this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you really look–...Look?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s just…my hair looks terrible and my clothes look really bad too,” she commented, examining the ‘mirror’ that her doppelganger presented with a frown. “Oh, there’s a tear right on my chest. Was that there the whole time? You didn’t add that, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What? Why would I–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Byleth punched her confused copy straight in the face because the idiot wasn’t paying attention to her free hand. She then proceeded to cut the fake’s head off while it was still dazed, and nodded to herself. “Right, I need a haircut…Hm. I shouldn’t let Shez do it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Speaking of Shez, she turned towards her sister, who seemed to be having a bit more trouble with her own copy, given that the two of them were both in their awakened forms at the moment and were matching each other strike for strike.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm.” Which led to a slight problem for Byleth. Namely that she wasn’t actually sure which one was her sister since they looked completely identical. “Ah, Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?”” the pair asked in unison, both looking over at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Hm. Do you want my help with this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, I got this–” “Yes, please, help me–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Byleth immediately flung a fireball at the one that actually asked for help.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez watched as her doppelganger exploded in flames, then looked over at Byleth. “...That was all you needed to figure it out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I feel like I should be mad for some reason, but that’s fair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You two are truly absurd,” Epimenides said, his voice echoing through the void before the sisters found themselves standing in a strange new area, where the caves and rocks appeared to mix with carved stone and strange teal lights across the ground. The sage himself stood above them, atop a higher platform with stairs leading up to it. “To think, you would work so readily together despite your natures…a true aberration in this world’s natural order.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah whatever, are you going to come down here and fight us, or are we gonna have to drag you down?" Shez asked, glaring up at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before he could answer, the space next to Shez and Byleth shattered, as Rhea came crashing through it. Jerking back a bit in surprise, the sisters watched Rhea ram her fist again and again into the face of a barrel-chested and gray-haired man, rhythmically punching into the bloodied ruin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The mimic of a man seemed to twitch as Rhea continued to beat him, before he finally faded away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Uh, was that guy important?" Shez asked, staring at Rhea, who was breathing in deeply. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He was no one." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth furrowed her brow. “Huh. I think I had dreams about exactly this moment. Though with more stabbing instead of punching.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Epimenides, meanwhile, scowled from his place atop the dais. “So it seems all three of my foes have gathered in one place. The incarnation of that hateful monstrosity, the abomination that enslaved this continent, and my fractured vessel, too foolish to realize the true depths of her betrayal. You all–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ve got a lot of nerve, talking about betrayals,” Shez interrupted, glaring straight at the sage, “But it doesn’t matter, does it? I’m done arguing with you, Epi. I don’t care what you have to say. You’re here, in front of me, and that means I’m going to kill you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If that is all you have to say, then let us begin," Epimenides said, before forming two cylindrical objects, which charged for a moment before sending twin beams of magic straight at the two nabateans. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Byleth and Rhea dodged to the side, Shez charged forward, aiming directly at their captor to finish this, flashing behind him as he tried to make her stumble with a screeching Banshee spell. Slashing with all her force, she scowled as her blade clashed against a magical barrier. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Foolish child, do you think you could harm me in my realm?" he mocked, glancing back at her with a cold glare–Then he flinched when a ball of light exploded against his barrier. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Epimenides immediately looked towards the source, his eyes wide at the sight of Byleth’s extended hand, before a series of Agnea’s Arrows began smashing against his barrier, the bolts of magic stabbing into its surface. “Gh–You loathsome beasts! You think you can break through the power of–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Shez rammed the point of her sword into the barrier and started stabbing into it, aiming to pierce through to get to the Agarthan sage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scowling, he warped away, making Shez stumble forward as he appeared behind Rhea. Raising his hand, a swarm rushed towards the Nabatean, which crashed against a bolganone as Rhea whipped around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Smoke covered the area, before abruptly parting as Dark Spikes pierced through them. None of them hit, and Epimenides narrowed his eyes as he searched for his foes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Rhea’s fist smashed into his barrier hard enough to leave a crack. It quickly sealed back up, but the evidence of damage was enough to drive Rhea into smashing her fists against the barrier again and again, aiming to break through the magic shield while Epimenides glared in open fury, incensed by the damage done.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You vicious, unthinking brute! You think you can just overwhelm me with force?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not alone,” she remarked, her own glare cold and intent as Epimenides felt a faint chill down his spine, right before two swords nearly pierced it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“GAH!” He yelled in pain from the sudden sharp points driving into his back as a pair of blades wielded by a pair of sisters pierced through his barrier. “YOU WRETCHED–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He saw Shez’s glare. The sheer fury in her eyes made a small, forgotten part of himself suddenly surge up, causing Epimenides’s barrier to falter for only a moment, though a moment was all Rhea needed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The fist that smashed into the sage’s face was a falling star impacting the earth. It hit him with a force he could only compare to the blast that killed him, breaking parts of his skull as the pair of blades tore through him, plunging all the way through and out of his chest. Had he lungs, they would have been impaled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As it was, the sage did not bleed red blood; he was not alive in that sense. Instead, the darkness that made up his being began to leak, flowing upwards into the air as he felt himself choke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Grk–Nh, hah, w-what…w-what is this? Am I…Am I dying?” He asked the question to the void itself, staring up at it as particles flowed from the wound in his chest. “...no. Why? I shouldn’t. I defeated death. I returned. I…why is it so dark? I…It was dark then…and then that hellish light…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea stared at him, silent and coldly satisfied. Byleth stared at her sister, concerned for her. Shez bowed her head, trying not to look at the being that was once her friend as he died.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…I cannot die. I cannot. I cannot. I can </span>
  <em>
    <span>not. </span>
  </em>
  <span>I am Epimenides. I am eternal. I am the protector of this world…” His gaze drifted down to the twin swords piercing through his chest. “No. No, not like this. Not ever. I cannot–I will not tolerate this humiliation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stumbled, catching herself before she tripped from the sudden disappearance of the weight on the end of her swords. She looked around, then grimaced when she saw Epimenides stumbling, trying to keep himself steady after warping away from them. There were holes in his white robes, darkness starting to drench the cloth like leaking blood. “...Come on, Epi. Can’t you just…just, please, give up already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” He stared at her, a dull look in his orange eyes. “Give up? Give up…what? My life? My world? My </span>
  <em>
    <span>pride?!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” He stumbled, that dullness morphing into a burning, vicious hate. “You know nothing of our greatness! You scramble in the dirt, unknowing of the depths to which you’ve sunk! These monsters stole everything from us, and you want me to give it up!? You want me to bow to my killers!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“YOU WOULD SIDE WITH THEM OVER </span>
  <em>
    <span>ME?!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” His voice echoed out, harsh and furious and all too pathetic as he tried to hold himself together, unwilling to cede for even a second. The void twisted around him, darkness reacting to his fury, before it began to pull towards him. His hand extended, and a book formed above his palm, the sight of its glowing surface making Rhea audibly growl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You hid a relic here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hrotti…my book. I crafted its pages from the flesh of your kind and built its cover with the bones of a black-scaled beast…” He tapped a finger against the crest stone there. “Her heart still beats here. Though…no, your kind has no beating hearts. You have nothing but stones. You are not alive. All you are…is material, for making something greater than you could ever be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His eyes turned towards Shez, ignoring the fury in Rhea’s eyes. “You abandon humanity for falsely ‘living’ objects crafted by the worst abomination to ever come to this world. You side with these…things? Then allow me to show you what monsters you would bow your head to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The void twisted again, darkness pouring into Epimenides’s wounds and burning bright with the same red-orange light that engulfed the tome called Hrotti. That light built up, shining brighter and brighter before twin roars echoed out in the dark as Shez came face to face with two massive creatures. One, an enormous horned turtle; the other, a gigantic, beaked and feathered dragon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The pair of dragons roared loudly, the sound echoing through the void as Rhea audibly snarled. “You would pervert even my closest allies!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This is what you fight for, Shez.” Epimenides ignored her, his eyes locked on his vessel. Fiery light filled his wounds, sealing them even as it burned at his robes. “Monsters, all of them. They are beasts. It is only right we treat them as beasts. What crime was there in hunting such creatures?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez just stared at him, up until she felt Byleth’s hand on her shoulder. She sighed softly at the comforting gesture, before nodding to her sister and turning towards their companion. “Hey Rhea, it might be kinda messed up to ask this, but could you handle the big guys?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would have argued if you asked otherwise,” Rhea stated, before immediately charging towards the dark copies of her fellow Nabateans, her body shifting as she went until a white dragon smashed straight into the false copy of the Immovable, immediately bowling the water dragon over onto his shelled back before she leapt for the Wind-Caller, sending the wind dragon to the ground in a screeching tangle of limbs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I could handle this,” Byleth noted, giving her sister a concerned look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, you could. I think I oughta do it though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay.” Byleth passed her sword over, nodding to Shez as Epimenides scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Spare me this ridiculous act,” he demanded as he tried to stand tall, every inch of his being pushed to the limits of keeping himself alive, his eyes focused straight on the hateful Fell Star that ruined everything. “You are nothing but a heartless beast, incapable of even the slightest–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then the great sage of Agartha choked as a pair of blades pierced straight through his chest and out his back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A pair of violet eyes filled his vision. It took him a moment to realize he was looking into the eyes of his vessel, before light spilled from his mouth and leaked down his chest, closer to blood than the darkness that began to flake away from his body. “...y-you…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. No hesitating this time,” Shez stated, meeting his gaze, “No sneak attacks either. Though it doesn’t seem like you saw me coming.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Y-You…Y-You foolish…ch-child…” He glared back at her, dark magic gathering as his halo and crown glowed. “Y-You would…Y-You…H-How could you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretty easily, Epi. You’re a monster.” She stated it plainly and simply, the truth of her statement resonating in the air. “All I want from you is one answer. Can I get Arval back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...h-ha. W-What use would I have for a construct that served its purpose?” His glare deepened, fiery light and deep darkness flickering around his body. “You think I can ever truly die? You may think me defeated, but for as long as my power resides within your body, I still linger! You will never be rid of me! And I </span>
  <em>
    <span>will</span>
  </em>
  <span> make you pay for this betrayal!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s my power too, Epi,” Shez retorted, her grip tightening on her summoned sword…before a thought occurred to her, and her eyes locked on the crown Epimenides wore. “And you just put an interesting thought in my brain.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–What are you–” And Epimenides went rigid as Shez grabbed his crown. “NO! NO, DON’T YOU DARE–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She ignored him, gripping tighter and starting to pull as red lightning crackled between him, a shriek of pain and outrage sounding out from the sage while Shez pulled on his power, her own markings glowing brighter in the dark with each forceful tug. She could feel him try to pull back, magic surging in piercing darkness and fiery light, before it suddenly surged, trying to push into her brain in some attempt at overwhelming her mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“IGNORANT CHILD! YOU HAVE NO CONCEPT OF WHAT FORCES YOU ARE–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I DON’T CARE! STOP TRYING TO HURT MY FAMILY AND GIVE ME BACK MY FRIEND!” Shez shouted over him, before tightening her grip and </span>
  <em>
    <span>tearing</span>
  </em>
  <span> the crown from Epimenides’s head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sage shrieked, then stumbled away from her as his body was wreathed in fiery light. The pair of swords pushed themselves from his chest as his wings sparked and his halo fractured, before there was an eruption of light and sound as the power that was Epimenides destabilized entirely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Power surged throughout the void, illuminating it as though a sun was born in its darkness. Every construct the fell sage had brought forth burned away in the light, before it finally subsided and a white figure stumbled out from the light, blinking their orange eyes in bleary confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...p-partner?” they managed to say, before collapsing forward into Shez’s arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"H-Hey Arval," Shez said, holding her friend close, "Glad to have you back." </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"So, you're Arval," Byleth said, staring at the spirit, who had woken up again and was now floating beside her sister.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes…I must admit, it is certainly refreshing being able to speak to someone other than Shez. No offense, partner," Arval replied, before glancing at Rhea, who was keeping her distance, “Though I suppose not everyone is ready to talk?” </p><p> </p><p>"Give her a moment, she’ll warm up. You're nicer than the other guy." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course they are! No way I would have been friends with Arval if they acted like Epi!" Shez declared, before slapping the spirit on the back. "And boy do I have so much to tell you!" </p><p> </p><p>"No need. I may not have been aware during my possession, but I seemed to have retained Epimenides’s memories." Arval smirked at their partner. "Really now, partner, I didn't think you'd end up with two girls." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth blinked as Shez stiffened. "Wait, what happened?" </p><p> </p><p>"I-I'll explain later! For now we should try getting out of here!" </p><p> </p><p>"You actually have a method to escape?" Rhea asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes! …Maybe. As long as it works, anyways," Shez said, getting Rhea and Byleth to stare at her blankly. "H-Hey, Epimenides is the one who made this place, right? So as long as Arval and I work together, we should be able to escape!" </p><p> </p><p>"In theory, that should work,” Arval agreed, “As this is his realm, his power should allow you to open it once more. Although…to be specific, you do not need me, you merely need his power." </p><p> </p><p>"Eh, semantics." </p><p> </p><p>"I don't think I made myself clear. You don't need me, partner." </p><p> </p><p>Shez paused, then gave Arval a concerned look. “What do you mean? I just got you back.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that, and I appreciate all you have done to help me, partner. Though I could have done without being stabbed through the torso twice,” they remarked, patting their mostly healed chest. Their smile faded after a moment as Shez continued frowning. “...I am sorry, partner. I…I would like to continue on as we were before, but we cannot ignore the years that passed between the last time you and I interacted without his presence.”</p><p> </p><p>“...what does that mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“It means that your body should be your own, Shez, just as it means that a part of me will always worry that Epimenides could return if I remained connected to you. I know it is unlikely, but so was the event that caused him to awaken in the first place, and I refuse to let you suffer the pain of sharing a body with someone who would rip it away from you if he ever had the full opportunity.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez swallowed, feeling her eyes start to burn with gathering tears. “That’s not fair, Arval…”</p><p> </p><p>“I know. I’m sorry. If I could, I would happily be your companion again. But if I did, then I would remain as an unheard specter, only able to interact with the world through using you…” They took a breath of their own, trying hard to keep their composure. “I…You should be free of this burden, partner. Free to live your life as you choose, without the legacy of a long dead fool hanging over you.”</p><p> </p><p>"B-But…but…I-I was able to beat him before, and I can beat him again!" </p><p> </p><p>"And are you willing to risk everyone you know for me?" Arval asked, getting Shez to stiffen. They smiled, leaning up and giving their partner a hug. “Thank you for caring so much about me, partner. You risked everything to try to bring me back, and I will always be thankful for that. Just as I am thankful that I finally get to hold you like this.”</p><p> </p><p>It took Shez a moment, but she eventually returned the hug, holding her friend as tightly as she could.</p><p> </p><p>“Ngh-A-Ah, c-careful, I am not as hardy as you–”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right, sorry!” She hugged them less tightly, before finally letting go. “...You know I would fight him for you, right? I’m going to keep fighting if I need to. He won’t stop me, even if he does come back.”</p><p> </p><p>“...you truly are the best partner I could ask for,” Arval praised, smiling at her, before they let out a sigh, “Though, if I have to admit it, I am also absolutely exhausted after everything. Fighting you is a tiring affair, partner, and I think I need some time to rest regardless.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so all of that was just an excuse not to tell me you needed a nap, huh?” Shez questioned, raising an eyebrow at Arval…then letting out a small sigh of her own. “You really want to stay here?”</p><p> </p><p>“...I want to stay close to you. I need to stay here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Got it…I’m going to miss you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll still be here, partner. Who knows? Maybe I’ll find a safe way to visit at some point…or perhaps you could visit me, once you figure out how to do so safely.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, maybe if I find a way to get here without killing someone every time.” Shez sighed again, before glancing back at Byleth and Rhea. “Well, I’m pretty sure I know how to get out of here now, mostly because of the whole…absorbing Epi’s powers thing. So whenever you want to go, I’m up to go.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Thank you for being Shez’s friend, Arval," Byleth said, smiling at the spirit. </p><p> </p><p>"And thank you for taking her in, all those years ago." </p><p> </p><p>"I think that was more papa than me." </p><p> </p><p>"Even so, thank you. Given how absent-minded she can be, I shudder to think what would have happened to her before I had awakened." </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck you too, Arval," Shez muttered, the venom missing from her voice. </p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry, she'll be okay." Glancing at Shez, Byleth put a hand on her shoulder,."She's stronger than both of us realize." </p><p> </p><p>Shez huffed, her face reddening a little at the praise, which earned a sly smile from Arval. “Indeed, she truly is the most wonderful partner I could have asked for. Strong, brave, and far smarter than she gives herself credit for.”</p><p> </p><p>“Eesh, you’re really laying it on thick there,” Shez grumbled, actually getting kind of embarrassed.</p><p> </p><p>“Why partner, whatever might be wrong, hm? I thought you adored being praised for your strength and skill?”</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah yeah," Shez huffed, looking away, "Just…take care, okay?" </p><p> </p><p>"If you get bored, Rhea and I made a bunch of stone dolls you can play with," Byleth offered, getting Shez to blink. Even more so when Rhea seemed to speak up for a moment, as if to take the offer away, before deciding not to. </p><p> </p><p>“I appreciate that. Thank you, Byleth. I am glad to have finally met you properly, and I’m sorry for trying to provoke Shez into conflict with you. I suppose I can blame it on the influence of Epimenides, but I still want to apologize regardless. I made some trouble for you, even if my partner loves you too much to ever truly hurt you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. It’s like you’re trying to embarrass me at this point,” Shez grumbled, which earned a small smile from Byleth.</p><p> </p><p>“No need to be embarrassed. I love you too, little sister.”</p><p> </p><p>“...this is the only time I’m letting you call me ‘little’ anything, especially since you’re still shorter than me.”</p><p> </p><p>“So, are we able to leave at any time now?” Rhea spoke up, trying to keep her face neutral despite the mix of emotions she felt at the moment. Mostly good, though a part of her did feel weird looking at Arval.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yeah! I think I can get us out of here right now!” Shez said with a grin, “Unless there’s anything left for you guys here?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, anything of note can be left here for, ah, Arval to…amuse themself with, I suppose.”</p><p> </p><p>“I appreciate that,” Arval said, smiling at Rhea, who looked distinctly uncomfortable.</p><p> </p><p>Shez, meanwhile, got up and drew her swords. She could feel a thrum of power through her, something that linked up with the void itself, and she could feel it pulsing through her white sword…actually, she could feel it in both her swords now. Which had some implications that she was going to think about later. </p><p> </p><p>For now, she just glanced over at Arval again. "I'm gonna miss you, buddy." </p><p> </p><p>“I will too. And remember, I will always be happy to host you if you get the opportunity to visit.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez remembered what exactly it took to travel into Zahras. "...I'll think about it." </p><p> </p><p>"You're nice Arval, but I don't think I'll come back here anytime soon,” Byleth said apologetically.</p><p> </p><p>Rhea didn’t even bother to reply. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yes, the ‘sacrificing a life’ part…well, we can work something out, I think. For now, please make sure to take care of her, okay, Byleth?" Arval requested.</p><p> </p><p>"I will…thank you for saving Shez all those years ago, Arval. I don't think I could ever pay you back for that."</p><p> </p><p>"You'll have to be more specific, I lost count of all the times I had to save her." </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah yeah, laugh it up,” Shez grumbled, which did earn some small laughs from Byleth and Arval before she stabbed her swords forward into the open air, somehow piercing into the void itself. With a slow drag downwards, she split the void apart, bringing light into the darkness for a sudden, impossible moment.</p><p> </p><p>And then they were gone.</p><hr /><p>Once she landed back in the dungeon, Shez took a deep breath, trying to ease herself as she heard Byleth and Rhea land behind her. Behind them, the rift quickly closed–</p><p> </p><p>"Wait, we forgot my headdress," Rhea realized, getting Shez to pause before she glanced at the archbishop.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…I’m not sure I can do a return trip right now?” She wiggled her sword, trying to see if she could find another easy way to cut across realms.</p><p> </p><p>"Technically it was mine, also, since I took it as severance pay,” Byleth commented, before pausing, “Though…hm, I just realized I left my coat behind…Well, it should be fine. I still have a spare at the monastery…right?" </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right, you guys are really out of the loop,” Shez realized, “Okay, uh…so, bad news, the monastery kind of fell a while ago. All the demonic beasts and invaders, plus Rhea suddenly disappearing, meant we all had to abandon the place and scatter, and nobody has taken it back yet. Well, I think no one has? I’m not completely sure. I’ve been kinda wandering around while the war is going on–Oh right, there’s been a war going on for the past three years.”</p><p> </p><p>“...oh. That’s not good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea looked even less pleased with that news. “How could this–No, never mind. Between whom?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Oh, uh…everybody?” Shez attempted to answer, “I mean, the Empire split in half–Well, maybe more like…two thirds, one third? Uh, Duke Aegir–No, Archduke Aegir now, he seceded from the Empire and made this whole Princy thing that’s invading the Alliance–Oh shit, right, the raid!”</p><p> </p><p>Shez immediately moved to the entrance to the dungeon, looking around worriedly. “HEY! IS ANYBODY STILL HERE?!”</p><p> </p><p>The lack of a prompt response immediately made her worried. She had no idea if time worked the same way between the void and the regular world and that struck her with a sudden sense of terror that she might have spent years and years inside fighting Epimenides without even realizing–</p><p> </p><p>"There you are!" And she suddenly found herself pushed against a wall, Kronya scowling at her as she grabbed her collar. "Where the fuck did you go!?" </p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Oh, great, I didn’t go missing for a century!” Shez let out a little relieved laugh, before smiling happily and giving Kronya a hug. “Mm, it’s good to see you!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Kronya, meanwhile, found her anger and worry rapidly fading as Shez embraced her, her face actually warming a bit as she was pulled close to her chest. “...uh…yeah. Okay. I’m good with this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hi Kronya,” Byleth greeted as she peeked out of the cell, smiling when she spotted the Agarthan. Before she noticed Kronya’s current position and the fact that Shez was hugging her very tightly. “Huh.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm–Eh? O-Oh, uh, hey professor! I was just–Wait, what the…” It took Kronya a second to register what she was seeing, before an immediate, big smile came to her face. “Professor! Holy shit, Shez actually got you back!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yep, she did. It’s nice to see you again, you’re looking well.” And a little bit squished, but then Shez was being very enthusiastic with her hugging.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, right, you already know about her!” Shez remembered, grinning, “Heh, well, guess that means I don’t have to introduce you!”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t mind if you did. I think you’re supposed to introduce someone as your girlfriend if you’ve started dating her, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“I am? Huh, I guess–Ah, wait, u-uh, Kronya and me? No, we’re not, er…<em> exactly </em> dating, I think.”</p><p> </p><p>Kronya saw an opportunity and immediately took it, keeping one arm around Shez as she pulled out of her embrace and grinning at Byleth. “Oh yeah, we haven’t been dating for a while, we’re way more official than that. Hell, I think we’ve been married for three years now, right Shez~?”</p><p> </p><p>Shez blinked. She…wasn’t quite sure what to say in response there, though Byleth just nodded. “That makes sense. I am upset you didn’t invite me to the wedding though.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez’s eyes narrowed at her sister’s deliberately blank expression. “We’re not married. I…you kissing me in the forest doesn’t count as marriage, Kronya.”</p><p> </p><p>“It doesn’t? Hm, that’s a shame. I guess you’ll just have to marry me properly then~”</p><p> </p><p>“...I-I, uh…w-where’s everybody else?” Shez asked, deliberately changing the subject.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right, that. They got a letter from Lorenz’s dad that said the attack was going on right now, so they had to go. You weren’t around though, so I said I’m staying.” She smirked. “So jokes on them, I made the right choice here.”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s an attack?” Byleth asked, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, crap, I didn’t think it would happen this soon,” Shez muttered, before turning to her sister, “Remember how Castle Ordelia got taken by that Acheron guy? Agarthans decided to keep the place after he died, so we were going to go through a tunnel here and try to take it back from them.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s going to be my castle when we take it back,” Kronya added, looking smug.</p><p> </p><p>“That wasn’t decided yet–Right, okay, we should go help them. As much as I hate her, Bias is still a dangerous opponent and I don’t want everyone to go up against her without us.." </p><p> </p><p>"Bias is here?" Byleth asked, a frown on her face. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, but you better not go rushing off to fight her on your own," Shez warned, frowning at her sister.</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t. I’ve learned from my mistakes. So, shall we take her on together?” She extended her hand to Shez, smiling.</p><p> </p><p>“...Hell yeah, let’s do it!” Shez declared, grabbing her sister’s hand firmly.</p><p> </p><p>“So should I address the presence of an Agarthan here, or…?” Rhea asked, raising an eyebrow as the sisters remembered she was standing in the cell the whole time.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yeah, uh, this is Kronya,” Shez introduced, gesturing towards her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Kronya greeted, giving her a small wave.</p><p> </p><p>“...” Rhea raised an eyebrow. “And who is she, exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Shez’s future wife.”</p><p> </p><p>“...u-uh, well, aside from, um, that…possibility, Kronya’s my friend and, ah, you might’ve known her as Emily,” Shez explained.</p><p> </p><p>Rhea’s eyebrow remained raised. “Who?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Emily Korsch?”</p><p> </p><p>“...?”</p><p> </p><p>“She was a student at the academy. She left after Bias attacked?”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea frowned. “She was one of the Agarthans that infiltrated the monastery?”</p><p> </p><p>"Look, trust me, Kronya can be trusted," Byleth said, vouching for her former student. </p><p> </p><p>"...Did you know she was–" </p><p> </p><p>"Rhea, we can deal with this later. Come on." </p><p> </p><p>Rhea frowned, then sighed, acquiescing. “Very well. Do you have a sword I can use?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, we should get both of you swords,” Shez realized, “Well that should be fine, there’s bound to be a bunch around here.”</p><p> </p><p>"Oh right, Shez, do you have the Sword of the Creator?" Byleth asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, no, I actually hid it, since it was too heavy for me to carry around. Don't worry, we can get it after this!" </p><p> </p><p>"Good, I'd prefer to make sure Sothis' spine is okay." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, of course–...what?" </p><hr /><p>Castle Ordelia had seen better days. That’d already been true when it had been overrun by demonic beasts, but it certainly didn’t look any better now that it was being fully besieged by an invading army.</p><p> </p><p>Even then, the castle likely would have held out against its invaders…were it not for the infiltrators that made their way inside through a secret tunnel, past all the defenses that were meant to keep intruders out.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh wow, Claude and the crew did some good work here,” Shez noted as she exited the tunnel alongside her sister and companions, taking in the black-armored corpses strewn about the ground. “Oh, I bet Lysithea got that one! Guy looks like a pincushion, she definitely spiked him.”</p><p> </p><p>"I could have done better," Kronya commented, before she ran forward towards the sound of combat. </p><p> </p><p>"This isn't a competition. I'm sure you've kept up your training, but you need to remain careful," Byleth said, keeping a steady grip on the steel sword she’d been given. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh I’ll be careful! Careful not to show you up too much, professor!” Kronya called back, before using her tails to propel herself forwards and stab straight into the neck of a knight distracted by Alliance forces.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I suppose it’s a good thing to have an Agarthan’s bloodthirsty nature on our side for once,” Rhea muttered as she hurried after the younger women, her white gown changed out for some proper, if basic, armor to fight in.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth and Shez, meanwhile, quickly fell into rhythm as they joined the fight. Shez sped in, cutting down foes with ease while Byleth supported her with magic and her own blade, taking out any stragglers and finishing the wounded as the two sisters, working together in near perfect sync despite all their years apart, took control of the entire battlefield.</p><p> </p><p>The Alliance troops, initially surprised by the sudden reinforcements, quickly rallied and began to push against the forces of House Phlegethon, who soon found themselves routed. Though Byleth and Shez didn’t focus much on that, instead heading further into the castle in search of their friends while the Alliance troops found themselves suddenly under the command of the archbishop, of all people, as Rhea took charge.</p><p> </p><p>As for the Eisner sisters, they soon made their way to the great hall of Castle Ordelia, where, sure enough, they found their friends, their foes, and a modified demonic beast.</p><p> </p><p>“Woah, that’s a big guy,” Shez remarked, taking in the quadrupedal monstrosity, its head covered in a metallic mask. Unlike an “altered demonic beast” though, the modified beast had a blue cloth hanging over its mouth instead of the standard red one and the metal covering its body was spikier and silvery instead of golden. “Ah, that’s probably the ice-breath type they were talking about.”</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t mention that earlier,” Byleth noted, quickly taking in the battlefield and all the forces present as the Deer tried to deal with the monster.</p><p> </p><p>“Eh, I had other things on the mind. I don’t think there’s much difference between them, but be careful anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>“Understood.” The wide spacing in the great hall meant that the Deer had a good amount of room to maneuver, as evidenced by Claude using his wyvern to stay out of harm’s way, though the battle seemed like it wasn’t going completely in their favor considering the Agarthans had multiple armored knights backing up the beast. “Hm…LEONIE! IGNATZ! FOCUS YOUR ARROWS ON THE BEAST! KEEP ITS ATTENTION AWAY FROM LORENZ AND WHITTLE DOWN ITS ARMOR SO HE CAN GUT IT!”</p><p> </p><p>The Deer in question paused for just a second at the sudden, surprising voice calling out orders, but with a renewed vigor, the former students leapt into action as Byleth and Shez joined the fray. </p><p> </p><p>"CLAUDE, COVER THE ARCHERS! LYSITHEA, SCATTER THE KNIGHTS!" Byleth shouted, causing the two in question to go into action, a flurry of magic and arrows kept everyone safe. </p><p> </p><p>Letting out a roar as Lorenz dragged his spear through its gut, the Demonic Beast released a spray of frozen magic, only for it to clash against an Aura. As an icy mist exploded across the battlefield, the demonic beast had a moment to look around only to roar in pain, as Byleth and Shez jumped through the mist, their swords piercing through the metallic mask and into its eyes. </p><p> </p><p>The beast shrieked in agony, stumbling and wrenching its head to try to throw them off, though its limbs soon began to weaken before it finally collapsed, crashing to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, my. That is not optimal.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth and Shez pulled their swords free from the dead beast and stepped forward together, looking and glaring at the two women up on top of the dais.</p><p> </p><p>“Heh. So you did get her back…” Bias murmured, then smirked beneath her mask and waved to the two sisters, “Hello, Fell Star and Failed Vessel.”</p><p> </p><p>“You know, it feels unfair that you got to say hi first,” Claude complained as he landed his wyvern beside Byleth, before glancing at the older Eisner sister, “Hey Teach. Long time, no see.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey Claude,” Byleth replied, keeping her eyes on Bias.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re going to have to talk later,” Lysithea stated, moving to stand beside Shez as magic gathered at her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yeah, we definitely do,” Shez agreed, thinking about…well, a lot of things at the moment, “For now, we better focus on the fight.”</p><p> </p><p>“Excellent thinking, Shez. I will congratulate you on your success later,” Lorenz stated, bringing his horse up alongside Lysithea, his own eyes locked on the second woman up on the dais, “For now, Lady Cocytus Phlegethon, if that is your real name, on behalf of House Gloucester and the Alliance, I demand your surrender!”</p><p> </p><p>“I will have to refuse,” the blonde in the brown dress replied, her hair curled into drills, “Surrender is not an option.”</p><p> </p><p>“You sure?” Shez called out, “Because we don’t have to kill you. You could just call it quits here and let us take you prisoner.”</p><p> </p><p>“You would have value as a hostage,” Claude pointed out, “Sure, you might’ve committed a few crimes here and there, but if you’re willing to give us information–”</p><p> </p><p>“That is a remarkably insulting insinuation, you filthy beast,” Lady Cocytus responded, her tone cold and even, “To claim I would betray my kind for the sake of a beast’s mercy…I believe I will have to kill you personally for that.”</p><p> </p><p>“...well, can’t blame a guy for trying.” Claude’s eyes narrowed even as he kept up his smirk. “Any chance you’ll tell me who you really are before you kill me?”</p><p> </p><p>Lady Cocytus, otherwise known as Kyrie of Agarthan, the Sage of Water, regarded Claude with a cold disinterest. “I have no reason to give my name to a dead man.”</p><p> </p><p>As the false noblewoman stood poised to face off against the Deer, Bias stared down at Byleth, her gaze unwavering. </p><p> </p><p>She felt her hands twitch the longer she stared, as her pulse began to rush. Even with the mask covering the Agarthan’s face, Byleth could tell Bias was smiling as a light within the sage's heart began to kindle once more. </p><p> </p><p>"Bias, before we start, I only have one thing to say," the Fell Star started, "I'm sorry for what happened to your sister," </p><p> </p><p>Bias felt her smile become a scowl, "What, don't tell me you're going to do a sappy–" </p><p> </p><p>"But, regardless of what happened, I want you to know that I'm going to kill you here and now. Because I hate you far more than I could ever pity you." </p><p> </p><p>"...Oh you have no idea how long I have waited to hear those words." Then she raised her hands and the room erupted in flame.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>The Great Hall of Castle Ordelia burned as the Agarthan Sage of Fire let loose with years of pent up hatred. The torrent of fire she let loose melted the stone floor, searing it down to the earth beneath it, which began to bake under the intense heat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Not good,” Byleth remarked, having already used up a charge just to move everyone out of the way of that blast, which prompted startled noises from Lorenz and Lysithea when they realized they were suddenly several feet to the right of where they’d been standing previously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What in the–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s magic, don’t worry about it,” Shez interrupted, before quickly warping over to Bias, though she had to warp back when another burst of flame nearly took her head off. Said flames did also set the ceiling on fire, which wasn’t great. “Oh, this is going to be bad–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, all of a sudden, the heat in the room abruptly cut out as Lady Cocytus let out a slow breath, mist emanating from her mouth as she spoke: “Niflheim.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In an instant, the melting stone went solid, cooled back to solid stone as the temperature dropped. A small stone, placed as a jewel on Lady Cocytus’s chest, glowed a vivid blue as the disguised Agarthan called on a rush of ice magic far beyond anything the assembled Deer had seen before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Frozen constructs, knights made out of ice, began to form in front of the Deer, their spindly forms clutching frozen spears that quickly jabbed out towards the closest targets. All while Kyrie breathed out a cold mist that began to fill the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A successful attempt,” the Agarthan noted, before glancing at her fellow sage, “May I expect your assistance?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can expect me to kill the Fell Star,” Bias responded, her eyes fully on Byleth as flames gathered at her hands, spinning like wheels in her grasp, “Anything else, you should be able to handle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I can understand these parameters,” Kyrie accepted, before raising her hand again, “Tundra.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ice and snow launched from her hand, bathing the ground in frost and scattering the Deer with a relentless barrage of hail.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the hell do we do against that!?” Leonie yelped, dodging a stab from one of the spear-wielding ice-knights before retaliating by impaling the construct with her own spear and using it as a shield from the snow, “How can they even cast spells that strong?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s the stone at her chest!” Ignatz called out, taking cover from the snowstorm behind the dead demonic beast, “It started glowing when she cast her spells!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good eye!” Claude praised, trying to keep his wyvern low to avoid getting the poor, shivering mount stabbed by icicles, “So we have a weak point to aim for!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And how the hell do we hit it!?” Lysithea snapped, before sending a blast of darkness to shatter some of the constructs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth and Shez, meanwhile, had a slightly different problem on their hands in the form of Bias launching herself off the dais and smashing right into the ground between them. A plume of fire erupted around her body as the sisters dodged back, but Bias didn’t even take a moment to pause before letting loose with a fireball at Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth easily cut the fireball in half, dispersing the magic, but that just brought Bias in closer as she launched flame after flame at the object of her hatred. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted another chance at killing you!” the Agarthan shouted, the eagerness in her voice obvious to anyone listening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I think I have a good idea," Byleth responded, dodging a stream of fire as Bias continued to unleash her flames. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh please, everything I've done to you pales in comparison to what you've done to me." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You burned my eye out!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"And it grew back! Not to mention you stabbed me in the tit!" Bias shouted back, before a pillar of fire burst up behind her, cutting off Shez’s attack. "You can tell the brat to leave." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"As if I'd let Byleth fight you alone!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I already know how dangerous you are,” Byleth stated, “I'm not risking letting you escape, especially since you'd just go after someone I care about." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In the past, perhaps. But right now?" Bias faced Byleth, and the former mercenary could tell she was smiling. "I don't care about hurting you, I want nothing more than to kill you. To see the life drain from your eyes as I tear open your chest and burn you alive from the inside out~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked. “...hm. Shez, you’re better with obvious emotions, did what she said sound weird to you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It sounded kinda flirty, yeah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Hm. I…hm…Please don't tell Dorothea or Edelgard about this,” Byleth requested, before dodging another giant ball of flames that filled the air with even more steam. Which, hm. “Shez, could you come over here? I would like to use your power to warp around.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you really calling out your plans right in front of me?” Bias questioned, a mix of amusement and indignation audible in her voice as Shez immediately warped over to her sister and put a hand on her shoulder. Then the pair vanished again, right before another torrent of fire bathed the place where they stood in flames. “Tch. You can’t run from me, Fell Star! I’m not going to–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The instant she felt heat at her back, Bias whirled, catching the fireball Byleth threw. She held it in her head, scoffing. “Are you seriously trying to fight me with my own element?! Are you really that stupid!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m just better at it than you are,” Byleth stated quite plainly, which earned an audible growl from the sage as she immediately caused the fireball to triple in size, before throwing it back at Byleth. Though, of course, Shez immediately warped with her again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, she really is bad at this,” Shez commented, keeping an arm around her sister’s shoulders, “She’s just going wild, not actually aiming.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that what you think?” Bias’s tone turned low and angry, the flames she held focusing to a point before shooting forward as a beam of fire. And then it missed. Again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If she wasn’t wearing a mask, the Eisner sisters would’ve plainly seen a vein twitching in Bias’s forehead. “STAY STILL, YOU SHIT!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh.” Meanwhile, Claude was watching the flames while trying to keep low and avoid the continually launching icicles and spawning ice-knights. “Hey Lysithea, how attached are you to this place?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” The mage, who was crouching beside his wyvern, frowned at him. “...why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because your crush and her sister are trying to piss off that fire mage enough that she does something stupid. Problem is, all this heat and cold probably isn’t going to be good for the stone around here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm. A castle can be rebuilt. It doesn’t matter as much as us surviving.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude grinned. “Good answer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then he promptly stood up, aimed, and loosed an arrow straight at Kyrie. The Agarthan ice mage didn’t even move, instead raising a hand and forming a shield of ice in front of her that the arrow pierced into. “What a thoughtless action. Do you beasts have any sense of–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she blinked when she saw Byleth and Shez suddenly appear in front of her, the latter grinning and giving her a cheeky wave while the former made a rude gesture towards Bias on the other end of the room. And Bias, in a moment of pure anger, immediately launched a massive, focus beam of fire straight across the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sure enough, Byleth and Shez vanished before it could hit them, but Kyrie couldn’t copy that ability to warp and instead felt her eyes go wide as she saw an inferno about to impact her. “Oh dear.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Heat met cold in an enormous plume of steam and mist, the shield shattering immediately and blasting Kyrie into the far wall with a brutal impact.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, shit, she was one of the few I could tolerate," Bias grumbled as she saw her companion slump onto the floor, "Sorry, Kyrie!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I-If you wish to make it up to me…" the ice mage said, reaching up to grab the jewel on her chest, "Then do make sure to take notes." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The combatants stared in confusion as she pulled the stone from the pendant, before their eyes widened in shock when she put it in her mouth and swallowed it. The mage seemed to gag for a moment, before a sudden chill hit everyone there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The air seemed to pulse with a sudden pressure, before the temperature dropped rapidly, the walls fully freezing as Kyrie’s body trembled. Her guise as Lady Phlegethon melted away, the magic that formed it burning up in a burst of icy blue magic that rushed through the Agarthan’s body, her hair bleaching white in a way that looked far too familiar to a certain mage among the Deer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The cerulean scales that began to spread across her skin were different though. As was the sickening crack of her bones as her body began to shift and morph. Everyone could only look on in horror as her limbs began to elongate and grow thicker. As her partly burnt clothes fell away to expose pale-blue muscle, hardened like stone and stretched taut across her distorted body, Kyrie stood at her full height on clawed feet, a long, scaled tail extending down from the base of her spine. Now towering over everyone there, the once human-looking Agarthan stared down at her gathered foes with eyes like glowing blue orbs in black pits, before her mouth opened to bare sharp teeth in a fierce roar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Myson, you mad man." Byleth heard Bias mutter, before the remaining sage jerked back when a spear of ice jutted up from the ground, almost gutting her. "Ha, fine, if this is the end you want, then take it. As for you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She glanced at Byleth, smirking. "I'll let you go for now, but know this, next time we meet, I'll have you on your knees begging for mercy~" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please stop speaking like that,” Byleth requested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The fact that it bothers you means that I’m going to keep doing it.” With her piece said, Bias warped away, leaving everyone behind to deal with the sudden monstrosity in their midst.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"...Hm." Deciding not to think about that, Byleth turned back to the transformed Agarthan, just in time to block a clawed hand swiping at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"F-FELL STAR!!!!" </span>
  </em>
  <span>Kyrie shouted, her hand clenching the sword, and forming ice over the blade. Eyes widening, Byleth let go of the sword and jerked back as the sword froze over an instant later. Crushing the sword, Kyrie tried to swipe at Byleth again, only for the green-haired mercenary to warp away thanks to Shez grabbing onto her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>"ABOMINATION!" </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"FOCUS YOUR ATTACKS!" Byleth commanded as she and Shez appeared on the other side of the field. "SHE'S AFTER ME, SO I'LL KEEP HER ATTENTION!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Seriously? Wouldn't it just be smarter to, I dunno, freeze time and attack her?" Shez asked, her breath heavier from all the warping she had been doing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Not that easy," Byleth admitted as Kyrie looked around in a jerking manner, her head twitching and twisting before her gaze focused on Byleth, "Moving while time is stopped takes more out of me, so I can't use it as much or as long. And I'd rather not get close to her right now." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bringing up her hand, Byleth cast Bolganone on the charging Agarthan as a slew of arrows and magic hit her as well, alongside a javelin thanks to Lorenz, only for the monstrosity to shrug it all off. Continuing her charge, the beast left a wake of ice as she moved, before leaping towards Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A screech of frustration echoed out as Kyrie’s claws tore and froze the ground where Byleth once stood, the professor easily escaping thanks to her sister’s powers. Kyrie rapidly looked around before she jerked when a volley of Dark Spikes hit her from two directions, making her scream as they exploded. Yet before the smoke could even settle, she was attacking once again, this time rampaging at whoever was closest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit!” Shez yelped, immediately letting go of Byleth and warping over to Lysithea so she could grab the mage and vanish before Kyrie’s claws could slam down on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah! Sh-Shez??” Lysithea yelped, startled by the mercenary’s sudden appearance. Her face warmed slightly as she felt Shez’s arms around her, before her embarrassment faded into worry when she saw how heavily Shez was breathing. “What’s happening to you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Huh? Ah, nothing, I think? I mean, I guess I was moving a lot, really just…doing all that.” She paused. “Shit, this is still the same day I finished off Epi. That’s wild.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What??" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'll explain later," Shez responded, looking back towards the fight as Kyrie tried to leap towards Claude, his wyvern screeching as it pulled back a now frozen wound on its gut. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she could leap again, Kyrie's head was slammed to the side thanks to Byleth grabbing a hammer from a fallen knight. Kyrie turned to look at Byleth, before letting out a roar that caused an explosion of ice to bloom from the ground. Gritting her teeth as she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen, Byleth froze time, pulling back as she swung the hammer again and again into the Agarthan, before moving away as time started again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kyrie jerked, cracks sounding out as she was impacted several times all at once, but her hide was too hard to get through and with another screech of rage and anger, the temperature dropped even further.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Doing her best to channel fire magic through herself, Byleth felt her body shiver from the spreading cold. She cursed the fact that she had forgotten her coat. Her allies didn't seem to be faring much better as their breath misted over, specks of ice beginning to cover their clothes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The walls had almost entirely ice over by this point and thick icicles were forming on the ceiling as the Agarthan monstrosity twisted around, searching for anyone she could vent her fury upon. She bristled at the sight of weapons leveled in her direction, the glow of magic stinging her eyes, before she sighted what was to her mind an easy target: Ignatz, who stood away from the group, trying to nock an arrow with trembling fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The archer froze as the beast suddenly raced towards him, her massive size belying a frightening speed as his friends reacted just seconds too late–Then a brutal crack sounded out through the room, and everyone froze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ignatz shivered, staring up with wide eyes through frosted glasses as he saw Kyrie collapse to the ground, a shriek of pain sounding out from the monster as she clutched the stump at her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her right arm had snapped off completely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s too cold, even for her,” Lysithea realized, staring at the creature as she howled in pain, “Whatever she did, her body is not built to handle this kind of magic. She’s been freezing herself from the inside this whole time…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Everyone, keep moving! If we can't beat her, then we have to outlast her!" Claude shouted, getting Kyrie’s attention. With a pained roar, she attempted to attack the noble, only to stumble thanks to her loss in balance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she could push herself up, a mire spell landed on her back, the sludge weighing her down. Yet it only held for a few seconds before freezing, shattering to pieces as Kyrie pushed herself up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Growling, she began to lash around wildly, attacking whoever she saw with reckless abandon as more cracks started to form across her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aim for her legs! If we can destroy one, she won't be able to move!" Lorenz shouted, before ducking as Kyrie clawed into the ground, sending frozen chunks at the purple-haired noble. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before the monstrosity could continue to attack, a salvo of arrows and magic struck her distorted body, causing more cracks to form across her limbs, before a loud shatter rang out as her leg snapped and she fell. With a roar, she made one last desperate attack, dragging herself with her free hand towards Byleth before attempting to leap with her remaining leg. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Gritting her teeth, Byleth swung the hammer with all the force she could muster. As metal met scale, there was a brief moment of resistance, before the metal broke through, shattering Kyrie’s head and driving the Agarthan into the ground. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Panting heavily, Byleth let the hammer go, exhaustion rapidly hitting her. Placing a hand on her abdomen, she used the last of her magic to heal herself, closing the wound as best she could. All while the beast before her twitched on the ground, black blood leaking from a shattered skull.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the hell was that?” Leonie muttered, staring down at the ruined monster. Before she paused and glanced over at Byleth. “Also, uh…hi?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello,” Byleth replied, turning to her friend and smiling, “It’s nice to see you, Leonie.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she promptly flopped forward, narrowly getting caught by Shez and Leonie before she could hit the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please tell me you guys brought a healer," Shez asked, glancing around her former classmates, "Because Byleth and I really need one." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, she flopped forward as well, getting Leonie to yelp as she held onto both sisters so they wouldn't fall over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"W-We should get them out of the cold!" Ignatz immediately said, moving to help Leonie carry the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Right, we should all get out of the cold before we start feeling the effects," Claude stated, "Lorenz, make sure none of Count Gloucester's men mess with the body before we can properly check it out." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hmph, you are lucky that we have more pressing matters to focus on rather than you attempting to order me around," Lorenz huffed as everyone began to leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What happened here?" Though before they could, they were stopped as they found the former archbishop standing before them. One who looked both worried and angered as she stared at the unconscious Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And before anyone could answer, another interruption appeared in the form of Kronya, making her way past Rhea and standing proudly. "Alright, everyone is dead, this is my castle now!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea stared at the absurd Agarthan for a few seconds, before turning to look at Claude and Lorenz with a baffled expression. “You agreed to give </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> this castle?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lorenz scoffed. “We made no such agreement–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They absolutely did,” Kronya interrupted, nodding firmly, “Castle’s mine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is not–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well we do need a new Count to hold this territory,” Claude mused, trying to hide a smile, “I guess if Lorenz and Lysithea already agreed to it, I’ll give the go ahead too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I did not–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Alrighty then, the first order of business is to get me a fancy room," Kronya said, grinning to herself. Lysithea couldn't help but scowl at the assassin, yet was unable to offer a retort thanks to Leonie speaking up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Guys can we argue later? Shez and Byleth kinda need to see a healer."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes, of course. Please, allow me to aid them,” Rhea offered, quickly heading over to help lift Byleth up–Though she immediately dropped her when she spotted the remains of Kyrie, earning a small yelp from the exhausted professor. “What in the Goddess’s name is–Oh no, my apologies child! I didn’t mean to–Here, let me help you up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s a good question, actually,” Kronya commented while Rhea fussed over Byleth, “What the hell is that thing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"One of the people working with the Red Mage. I don't know what exactly happened, but she swallowed a small stone-like object," Lorenz explained as Rhea healed Byleth’s now broken nose, "Whatever it was amplified her power, but also turned her into this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea stiffened. “Was it a crest stone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not sure,” Claude admitted, “It might’ve been, but we can’t exactly check now, can we?” He paused. “Well, maybe if we cut her open.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Claude! That is a revolting suggestion!” Lorenz reprimanded, looking disgusted, “Even if she became a monster, you should know better than to suggest dissecting a human being! Especially in front of the archbishop! It goes against every teaching of the church!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude raised an eyebrow, well aware that Lorenz wasn’t as faithful as this show he was putting on suggested. Then again, they were in front of the archbishop herself…who actually looked a little irritated that her own rules were coming to bite her like this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you, Lorenz," Rhea said, a bit of annoyance in her voice, "For now, let's just try to make sure no one touches the remains." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Of course, Lady Rhea," Lorenz responded, bowing slightly to her as Claude rolled his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"In that case, after making sure Teach and Shez are okay, we should find some place to discuss what we should do going forward." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I vote we head to the Empire," Byleth said, raising a limp hand to vote. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You would,” Shez grumbled, though she sounded amused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, maybe we should go find Captain Jeralt first?” Leonie suggested, immediately making Shez blanch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…maybe that Empire visit is a good idea after all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great! Captain Jeralt should still be down there, I think.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...h-hm. So that’s where he is…” Letting out a sigh, Shez felt a bit of dread, realizing she couldn't run away from her dad forever. Maybe he wouldn’t be too mad…?</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Humming to herself, Bias watched on from the frozen rafters above as the Fodlaners left the room, leaving Kyrie’s body alone. That purple one was having some of his knights head in to guard the body, which made things slightly inconvenient, but Bias was nothing if not good at dealing with inconveniences.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…no, that was a lie, she was bad at getting rid of those that inconvenienced her. She let out a sigh at that thought, feeling annoyed with herself for letting the Fell Star get away again. She’d let her temper get away from her, but she just felt so…elated in that moment, that she was finally getting a chance to kill the object of her obsession. The fact that the Fell Star came back to her, that she existed in the world again, it brought Bias out of what had been a depression stretching on for years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At least with the Fell Star back, Miss Byleth Eisner, Bias could put her mind to something constructive instead of dwelling on her murdered sister and how that bastard Myson was holding her resurrection over her head. Of course tormenting the bitch clearly had no effect, considering she had been stuck within Zahras for years and yet remained as strong-willed as ever. Sure, it might be fun to kill her loved ones before her, but that wouldn't break her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No, Bias needed to get far more personal, to have her scream in pain and agony as she begged for the sweet release of death. Then and only then, would Bias be satisfied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, Miss Byleth Eisner, I can't wait for the two of us to get well acquainted with one another~." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With a grin, Bias hopped down, launching a plume of fire all around her and getting the guards to scatter. It would only buy her a few moments, but it was enough. Having gotten well acquainted with the false relic stones, Bias could tell where in Kyrie’s body the stone remained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before anyone could react, she plunged her hand into Kyrie's stomach, her hand wreathed in flames to protect her from the cold. Then she tore the stone straight out in one swift motion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a moment, Bias stared down at her now dead companion. A part of her couldn’t help but marvel at the monstrosity she became…before she launched herself up again with a burst of flame, escaping as quickly as she could before any of the guards could grab her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stone pulsed in her hand, its surface warped after its time in Kyrie’s belly. The part of Bias that still retained her scientific curiosity observed the distortions in the stone, noting where it had likely connected to her flesh based on the shifts in its surface. Instead of a perfect sphere, the stone resembled more of a spiked prism…octagonal, maybe?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias continued studying the stone as she used her flames to propel herself up to the castle walls, noting its increase in size and the patterns spread across it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Patterns that resemble an Agarthan core,</span>
  </em>
  <span> she noted, her curiosity rising, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Did you eat up some parts of Kyrie, little stone? And if you did…how could I use this information?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias smiled as she vaulted over the ramparts. All in all, she had to say, today was a good day~.</span>

  <p>“This sucks,” Shez grumbled from the bed she was laying in, prompting a glance from Byleth in the next bed over.</p><p> </p><p>“We need to rest, Shez. We went from fighting Epimenides to fighting through a castle and taking on Bias and Kyrie, all in one day.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that. Still sucks. I went to sleep already, I should be able to get up now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can you get up?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez attempted to move her very sore limbs, then let out a little hiss of pain. “Nh…yeah, no, that’s not working…"</p><p> </p><p>"See? Besides, the beds are comfy. Much better than rocks." </p><p> </p><p>“Rocks? Wait, how barren was that place you were stuck in?”</p><p> </p><p>“Extremely. I slept on rocks, I trained with rocks, I even ate rocks. Apparently that’s just something I can do now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. Oh yeah, uh…I guess we should talk about why your hair’s green now?”</p><p> </p><p>“I fused with Sothis and she turned me into a Nabatean. Why’s your hair orange?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…I think it’s because I was leeching power from Epi? So now I’m, like…’fully awakened’, I think.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh. So you were only semi-awakened before now?”</p><p> </p><p>“I guess? Unless going fully awakened would mean my hair turns fully orange. Oh, or white, like Arval’s…ah, I really don’t want my hair to turn white, that would suck.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well that’s rude, partner,” Arval complained as they floated beside Shez, “I find a way to visit and the first thing I hear is you complaining about my hair." </p><p> </p><p>"Arval!?" Shez shouted, getting Byleth to flinch slightly from the sudden shout. "What are you doing here!?" </p><p> </p><p>"Checking in on you, obviously. I mean, it hasn't even been a day since we separated, and here you are, infirmed already." </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I fought a huge battle after we left! It was tough! And also, how are you talking to me!? We had a whole big goodbye over the fact that you couldn’t come back with me! What happened to that!?”</p><p> </p><p>Arval shrugged. “I took a nap and felt better, so I thought I would say hi and it turns out I can.”</p><p> </p><p>"..." Shez narrowed her eyes. "Give me back my tears." </p><p> </p><p>"Heh, well, to be specific, I still have a connection with you, but it's more strenuous. I won't be able to talk to you all the time, but we'll be able to discuss things on occasion. Just be aware that the connection isn’t perfect, so we may–” And Arval abruptly vanished.</p><p> </p><p>“...hm.” Shez laid back down. “...I think I’m gonna take a nap now.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth raised an eyebrow, having been there for half of that entire conversation. “Should I ask about what happened?”</p><p> </p><p>“Arval can talk to me from the void, apparently.”</p><p> </p><p>“...didn’t they say that would be a bad thing because Epimenides could take control of them again?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think it’s fine? It’s like…they, as a separate person, are using magic to talk to me from the void. We’re not in the same body anymore and there’s no chance Epi could take me over if he ever did come back.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s good then. Make sure to tell them hi for me."</p><p> </p><p>"Sure," Shez agreed with a sigh, settling back in her bed. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…hey, do you know when we'll get to eat? I kinda want to eat something that isn't a rock." </p><p> </p><p>"Just ask when someone comes by." Shez huffed, before turning over and going to sleep. </p><p> </p><p>"...hm." Sighing, Byleth laid back, staring up at the ceiling and waiting for someone to come by. “...I’m bored.”</p><hr /><p>"Gotta say, didn't think you'd still be such a big eater after all this time, Teach," Claude commented, watching the green-haired mercenary as she scarfed down her third plate of food. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth let out a muffled reply, before swallowing, "You try living off of rocks for three years." </p><p> </p><p>"...Right. Speaking of, I wanted to ask just where exactly you've been. I was going to ask Shez as well, but…" He glanced over at the snoring mercenary, "Well, I can do that later." </p><p> </p><p>“Gmnh–Mm-”</p><p> </p><p>“You can swallow your food first.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth did so, then took a moment to drink some water and wash it down. “Mm. Thank you for being patient. I really was hungry…and still somewhat am…”</p><p> </p><p>“So I’m guessing you really didn’t get a lot of food where you wound up?”</p><p> </p><p>“I mentioned the ‘living off rocks’ part earlier.”</p><p> </p><p>Claude paused. “That was literal?”</p><p> </p><p>“It was, yes. I was stuck in a void of eternal darkness. It wasn’t very good for keeping myself well-fed.”</p><p> </p><p>“...hm. So, do you mind explaining that part? How did you wind up in a ‘void’? And how in the world did you manage to survive off of eating rocks?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that last part is easy to explain. I actually–” Byleth paused as the door to her room was shoved open, before smiling slightly when she saw Kronya was the one barging inside. "Hello there, Kronya." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm? Oh, hey there professor! Was coming to visit Shez, but I see she's still out," the Agarthan said, glancing at the sleeping Shez, who snored in response, "Oh hey, you got food. Can I have some?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>Kronya blinked at the blunt refusal, then shrugged. “Alright, I guess. So, what’s up? Is Claude bothering you?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re the one who shoved her way in,” Claude remarked, amused. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not bothered, it's nice being able to talk to people. Aside from Rhea I only had my dolls to talk to," Byleth said, before munching on a piece of fish, "It's a good thing Rhea was there, or I might have started acting like the dolls were real people."</p><p> </p><p>"...Uh, you good, Teach?" </p><p> </p><p>"As good as anyone who was locked in the void for three years can be with the only company around being Rhea." </p><p> </p><p>“You have my condolences,” Kronya said, very sincerely, “You’re lucky I’m here to make things better." </p><p> </p><p>"That I am. Though I'm sure Shez will be luckier when you two do get married." </p><p> </p><p>"Of course she will! I'm just glad we managed to find someone for Shez to use that spell. Sorry to say, professor, but I wasn't going to volunteer." </p><p> </p><p>Byleth drank some water, before smiling. "I'm glad you didn't have to." </p><p> </p><p>"...W-Well yeah, I just said I wouldn't," Kronya huffed, looking away. </p><p> </p><p>“...” Claude, perhaps inadvisably, decided to cause problems. “Literal heart-rending sacrifices aside, aren’t you getting ahead of yourself, Kronya? You still have Lysithea for competition, remember?”</p><p> </p><p>"Pff, as if! She might not be a complete pipsqueak, but I could take her in a fight." </p><p> </p><p>“Lysithea is interested in Shez too?” Byleth asked, before pausing in thought, “Hm…it’s been three years, I forgot if I knew that already.”</p><p> </p><p>"Even if she is interested, I already staked my claim. And as the stronger of the two of us, I win." </p><p> </p><p>"You should probably talk with Shez about that, to see how she feels," Byleth advised as she tilted her head, "I mean, who knows, it could end up like Dorothea, Edelgard, and me." </p><p> </p><p>"Woah what?" Claude asked, blinking in surprise. </p><p> </p><p>"Well, I guess we never made it official, since everything that happened at the monastery happened before we could, but I was dating Dorothea, both of us are interested in Edelgard, and I'm pretty sure she's interested in the two of us." Byleth paused before frowning, "Hm. I need to check if they're okay." </p><p> </p><p>“Hm…well, I get why you might want to, but there’s a few things in the way of that,” Claude stated, his gaze calculating as he considered all of the information he’d just received, “There’s an entire new nation between us and the Empire, in case you didn’t know already.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth’s frown deepened. “I didn’t. Shez mentioned that Duke Aegir escaped and seceded from the empire.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, he did, and he made his own nation out of Hrym called the Principality. Officially, Phlegethon here, formerly known as Ordelia territory, belonged to Hrym since that icy lady declared Archduke Ludwig as her liege. Of course, we of the Alliance didn’t exactly recognize that claim, but there wasn’t much we could do about it until now.”</p><p> </p><p>“And now that this castle is mine, I get to decide who I side with!” Kronya declared, grinning proudly.</p><p> </p><p>“And by that you mean you’re siding with us, right?” Claude asked with an eyebrow raised.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, obviously. You just gotta make it worth my while.”</p><p> </p><p>“…such as by, say, giving you a castle?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not at all. That was my payment for fighting for you guys in this last battle. I’m a mercenary, you have to keep paying me if you want me to work for you.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Mind helping me, Teach?" </p><p> </p><p>"No, she's right. If she's a mercenary now then you need to discuss a proper contract, and payments,” Byleth agreed, nodding. "Though, Shez would be disappointed if you sided against her." </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I never said I was siding against Shez!” Kronya responded, “I’m automatically on her side, since she’s my fiance.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, congratulations.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did she even agree to that?” Claude asked.</p><p> </p><p>“She will! Anyways, it’s not like I’m going to ask for anything crazy here,” Kronya assured, “I just want to be one of you Great House people.”</p><p> </p><p>“...that is an amazing idea and I fully support your claim.”</p><p> </p><p>"Oh sweet! Glad we got that settled," Kronya said, grinning, before heading over to sit by Shez. </p><p> </p><p>"Is it that simple to be a great house noble?" Byleth asked in a whisper to Claude. </p><p> </p><p>"No, she'd need all the other great houses to approve, but if it means she'll help us, I can say that much, at least," Claude quietly responded, "But that aside, we really should figure out what to do next." </p><p> </p><p>"Well, we should try to meet up with the Empire, right? Even if there is a Principality between us, we should send a small messaging party." </p><p> </p><p>"That might sound like a good idea, but it's not that simple. We just took back Ordelia and Phlegethon territory so we need to shore up defenses there before the Principality attacks. If we try to cross their borders too early and get caught, we might incite a response from them before we’re prepared to handle it. And sadly, we don't have the troops to make any big moves since we're also dealing with attacks from the Kingdom and Almyra." </p><p> </p><p>"What exactly is happening with Almyra? I thought I dealt with Shahid." </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, but he decided to rear his ugly head again thanks to the rest of Fodlan being at war." Claude let out an annoyed huff. "It's not just him either. From the reports I've gotten, there's at least two other princes and a princess who are also launching attacks of their own. Thankfully, they're too busy bickering amongst themselves to launch a conjoined assault." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm. Do we know why they're all attacking if they're not working together?" </p><p> </p><p>"Nope," Claude lied as he leaned back in his chair, "My best bet is that they're doing this to prove themselves worthy of the throne." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm…could we establish contact with one of them?" </p><p> </p><p>"Now why would you want to do that, Teach?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, if they're trying to prove themselves, then defeating their siblings in combat would be a good start right?" Byleth asked, tilting her head in thought. "Not to mention if they agree to work with us, they'd have the backing of the Alliance and presumably the rest of the nations once we deal with all our problems." </p><p> </p><p>"...That he would, wouldn't he?" </p><p> </p><p>"Or she. You said one of them was a princess right?" </p><p> </p><p>"Eh, she's probably a lost cause. Trust me, Teach, I've heard nothing but awful things about her." </p><p> </p><p>"If you say so…wait, I got it. I know who we should back," With a smile, Byleth nodded, "We get Shahid. I beat him up once I can do it again to make him agree to work for us." </p><p> </p><p>"...Right. I'll make sure to pin in that idea, Teach," Claude said, standing up, "For now, I have something to think about." </p><p> </p><p>With that Claude left the infirmary in a hurry. </p><p> </p><p>"...huh, he left before I could answer his question from earlier…eh, it's not that important." She glanced over at Kronya, who was currently leaning on Shez’s bed, waiting for her to wake up. For a brief moment she felt a tinge of jealousy with how Shez had both girls interested in her nearby. "...I hope we get to go to the Empire soon." </p><hr /><p>Byleth stared into the mirror and fluffed her overly long hair with a small frown. “Hm…I definitely need a haircut.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, do you want me to–”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Byleth immediately refused, not even bothering to look at Shez, who pouted. "The last time I let you cut my hair, I wore a helmet for a month." </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, that's only because Arval distracted me!" </p><p> </p><p>"Can you promise they won't distract you this time?" </p><p> </p><p>“Ah…probably? Look, I’m older, I’m wiser, I can definitely fix your hair. How short do you want it?”</p><p> </p><p>“...maybe I should just try braiding it like Rhea?” she considered, rubbing her chin in thought as Shez huffed. "I could just keep it in a ponytail…" </p><p> </p><p>She brushed her hair back, taking a moment to stare at herself. Her time in Zahras really hadn't been kind to her. For one thing, she was paler than she once was and she still had scars around her right eye from when Bias had burned her face, so it seemed her healing factor wasn't perfect either. She’d probably be bearing the scars of this experience for a while…</p><p> </p><p>Sighing, she moved to lay back down on the bed. </p><p> </p><p>"I hope we get to go soon." </p><p> </p><p>"Since when have you been this restless?" </p><p> </p><p>"It's…aggravating having to wait for everyone to come to a decision. I know there's important things we need to figure out, but…I want to make sure everyone is okay first. I know Edelgard and Papa are keeping them safe, but I want to see my class again." </p><p> </p><p>“I guess I get that. It still feels weird seeing you be the one complaining about being in bed,” Shez commented, laying back and propping her hand up with her hand, “Then again, you don’t have cute girls feeding you grapes when you request it.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I am not jealous of you and Kronya,” Byleth said, jealously.</p><p> </p><p>“Suuuuure. Seriously though, what gives? I thought you’d be looking on the bright side since you’re out of the void.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm…I guess it’s because I’m out of the void. I’m here, back in Fodlan, but I’m still not with everyone I care about. I’m happy to be back together with you, it’s just…I want to be back with my students. With Edelgard and Dorothea…and I want to make sure Papa is okay.”</p><p> </p><p>"...Yeah, I guess I can understand that…if you want, I can try telling Claude that you should go to the Empire while I stay and help with the Almyrans." </p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m not leaving you alone again.” Byleth pushed herself back up, a determined glint entering her eyes. “Alright, I’m going to talk to everyone.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Wait, what’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>“I need to know everything about the war with Almyra. Then we’re going to win it so I can get back to my students.” </p><p> </p><p>“...Heh, well, guess there’s no point in arguing huh?” Shez asked, standing up alongside Byleth. With the determined look in her eye, Byleth led the way out of the room. Though she immediately had to stop as she almost bumped into Lysithea…who had a bowl of grapes for some reason. </p><p> </p><p>“O-Oh, hello professor,” </p><p> </p><p>“...Hi, Lysithea. Did you need something?”</p><p> </p><p>“N-No, I, uh…just heard from Kronya that Shez was awake so…” Lysithea glanced down, before blushing, and hiding the bowl of grapes behind her back. </p><p> </p><p>“...Hm.” Byleth decided to ignore that and just keep walking to the castle’s meeting room. She had more important things to focus on than being jealous of Shez. Not that she was. </p><p> </p><p>Soon enough, she was in the meeting room, interrupting the discussion going on. </p><p> </p><p>"As such, I believe it would be best–Byleth?" Rhea exclaimed, surprised to see her walking around. </p><p> </p><p>"Hello, I need someone to bring me up to date on the Almyran situation." </p><p> </p><p>“The Almyran–ah, Byleth, we were actually just discussing the next course of action,” Rhea stated, gesturing to Lorenz, Claude, and a man who was clearly Lorenz’s father, “I believe our best move is to take Garreg Mach back and unite the forces of the Alliance and the Knights of Seiros so we can better deal with the issues across Fodlan.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm. We need to deal with Almyra first. It’s a bigger priority than gaining a position we can take at any time. Even though we took back Ordelia, we still have enemies on three different sides, so if we try to take Garreg Mach, we'll be stretching ourselves thin. Instead of trying to establish a new base, we should deal with one of the threats. From my understanding, the Almyrans invading us are actually four separate armies, none of whom are working with one another. So despite their size, they'll likely be the easier threat to deal with." Byleth took a breath as she considered her next words. "I mentioned this to Claude, but I believe that if we can convince one of the Almyran Royals to side with us, we could use their assistance to deal with the others, and potentially stop the invasions all together." </p><p> </p><p>"...You would have us aid those who have been invading us?" Count Gloucester asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Only one. From my understanding they're doing this to prove themselves as worthy as being ruler of Almyra. If we can back one of them, we could use that as leverage to ensure the invasions get called off, if they do take the throne." She paused, then glanced at Count Gloucester. “Also, hello, I’m Byleth Eisner, formerly a professor at Garreg Mach. It’s nice to meet you, sir.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Lorenz’s father appraised the professor for a moment, before showing a small smile. “Count Erwin Fritz Gloucester. Likewise. So, you believe we can suborn one of the Almyran princes invading? How exactly would we go about that?”</p><p> </p><p>“To begin with, we need information. Who the members of the royal families are, what their relationships are to each other, and who has the best chance of actually being useful to us. It will probably take some time to get all that together, but hopefully House Goneril has some ideas we can use.”</p><p> </p><p>"Actually, I have some information, so we don't need to go all the way there just yet," Claude spoke up, getting everyone's attention, "Thanks to the close ties between House Goneril and Riegan, I've been keeping up with who exactly we're facing. To be specific, the four Royals currently attacking us are named Farah, Aziz, Aref, and Shahid. Now, we've already met Shahid, so I'll be brief. He seems to be the oldest of the siblings, so he has the biggest backing behind him, but he's also the most incompetent in terms of leading an army. Everyone who fought at the Almyran invasion during the Academy can tell you easily enough that Shahid has no head for tactics and his only real move is to just get as many soldiers as he possibly can before charging for the forts. The only thing that makes him dangerous is if he has competent commanders backing him up.</p><p> </p><p>“Aziz and Aref, meanwhile, are actually working together. Supposedly they have the same mother, which is why they’re helping each other out. The thing is, they're also liable to turn on one another once it comes down to who's gonna be king. Blood only goes so far when it comes to court politics. And well, if they turn on each other, one of them will turn on us," Claude explained as he went down the list of siblings, "Then of course, we have Farah, the only princess of the group. As a younger, female sibling, she has the smallest backing from the traditionalist nobles of Almyra, which also makes her the one who wants to prove herself the most. Despite how small her army is, she's actually surprisingly competent and has been using plenty of hit and run tactics when attacking the Locket.</p><p> </p><p>Claude spread his hands out, grinning at the group. “So there you have it. We’ve got the arrogant oldest, the package deal that’s bound to spoil, and the headstrong princess who wants to look her best. Not exactly our best options for allies.”</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t need a permanent ally,” Byleth noted, “For the purpose of ending the invasion, we need a temporary ally who’s willing to back down at the end. It would be better if we could get a genuine ally who will work for a long-term peace, but if it comes down to it, facing one exhausted enemy is better than going after four ready ones.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. I cannot say I am comfortable with that idea, professor,” Lorenz spoke up, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh? Not a fan of allying with Almyrans?” Claude asked, keeping his tone light.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not that. I understand that rationale and I can accept that a new ally is better than another enemy, regardless of their nation of origin. The issue I have is with planning for a temporary ally. It would be dishonorable to plan on betraying our ally from the beginning. We should only side with someone we have the confidence will treat us as we intend to treat them.”</p><p> </p><p>"Hm, that's certainly an idealistic hope." </p><p> </p><p>"I will agree with my son,” Count Gloucester spoke up, “Even if we were able to deal with an ally turned enemy, we have no way to ensure no one else will retaliate afterwards. Surely the king would see us defeating four of his children as an excuse to lead the armies himself?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, the king leading a campaign himself probably isn’t going to happen unless we go out of our way to kill the royals,” Claude explained, “Almyran society values strength, but there’s still just as much backbiting and politicking among their nobles as there are over here. Maybe more so, since I’ve noticed poisoning people is considered pretty reprehensible in Fodlan.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea grimaced, displeased by the reminder of what happened at the Battle of Eagle and Lion. “Yes, I am sure you are well aware of that, Claude.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sure, it was a good lesson learned from my days at the Academy. If you want to poison someone, do it with a venin weapon.”</p><p> </p><p>Count Gloucester actually cracked a smirk at that. “A valuable lesson to learn indeed. So, as long as we avoid killing any of them, that will serve to our benefit?" </p><p> </p><p>"For now. However, even if the king won't retaliate, he also won't reign any of them in." Claude grinned wryly. “The throne of Almyra doesn’t necessarily go to the eldest. The king decides who his heir is, and there’s a lot of politics that go into who gets picked. Even if he dislikes one of them, they'll probably be appointed if they prove themselves. At the same time, you could be his favorite, but if you rest on your laurels, you won't get anywhere." </p><p> </p><p>“Hm…” Byleth tilted her head in thought. “Do you have any ideas on who his favorite might be?”</p><p> </p><p>Claude shrugged. “Beats me. I’d say he doesn’t have a favorite, if just so he can avoid the politics that would come with it. Back to the important part, if we <em> really </em> need to side with an Almyran to push things forward…there might be one more option. You see, there's supposedly another prince, one who isn't fighting at the border."</p><p> </p><p>"And how does that help us?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well, this prince supposedly has some connections to several high ranking men in the opposing forces, such as Nader the Undefeated. Allegedly, the reason this prince isn't taking arms up himself is because he wanted to gain merit in his own way, and decided to travel the lands of not only Almyra, but of Fodlan as well," Claude said, preparing himself for his big reveal. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, it's you, isn't it?" Only to have Byleth point at him. </p><p> </p><p>"...Huh?" </p><p> </p><p>"It makes sense. When we fought at the Locket, Nader specifically talked to you, as if you two were already acquainted. You're also quite skilled with wyvern riding, something more common in the Empire and Almyra rather than the Alliance. It would also explain how you seemingly came out of nowhere if you were born in a different nation and raised there.”</p><p> </p><p>“...wow. You’re just gonna steal my thunder completely, huh, Teach?”</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, sorry, go ahead," Byleth said, gesturing for him to continue. </p><p> </p><p>"...Right. Well, as Teach so eloquently put it, I am indeed a prince of Almyra, and my actual name is Khalid," Claude said, a bit deflated at being unable to do his whole reveal. </p><p> </p><p>An awkward silence fell over the room, as what was supposed to be a dramatic reveal now felt like a casual mention. </p><p> </p><p>Rhea, meanwhile, had her face in her hands. “...Did anyone attending the academy actually tell the truth of who they are?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Lorenz began to–</p><p> </p><p>“Put your hand down, Lorenz.”</p><p> </p><p>Lorenz quietly lowered his hand. </p>

  <p>"So, to clarify, you are the remaining Almyran prince?" Erwin asked, his arms crossed over his chest as he regarded Claude with a new eye. </p><p> </p><p>"Well if you want to be specific, I’m the only half-Fodlaner Almyran prince,” Claude answered, “The rest of the royals, you already know about, or they’re just too young to be leading any armies.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you’ve been lying to us this entire time?” Lorenz questioned, looking much more annoyed than his father.</p><p> </p><p>“Essentially? Yep, I’ve been lying about my origins. I didn’t lie about being on your side though, especially since I could’ve sabotaged our efforts for years if I really wanted to side with any of my siblings, who have zero reason to support my claim to the throne. And, if it helps, I’ve been having Nader keep me informed about what’s going on over on the Almyran side of things and I’ve passed his info onto our forces to keep the Locket defended. Ask Hilda, she can confirm it. Oh, and that’s not to mention that Nader can ruin Shahid’s entire offense if we want to push things right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? How?”</p><p> </p><p>Claude grinned. “Turns out, most people prefer working for a commander they know will do his best to keep them alive instead of a prince that’ll throw their lives away while leaving them to starve from a lack of supplies.”</p><p> </p><p>"Before we continue, I would ask that we see what Lady Rhea has to say,” Erwin interrupted,  “The tenants of the Church of Seiros speak against foreign relations, so I must ask if we have your blessing on continuing down this path, Lady Rhea.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Rhea stayed quiet for a moment, thinking. Saying yes would mean overturning centuries of careful work to keep the countries that surrounded Fodlan from interfering in their affairs. It could very well put them directly on the path to Almyra influencing–Then Byleth kicked her shin below the table and the archbishop had to hide a wince. “Hm. I can see the potential issues there could be from taking this course of action, but allying ourselves with Claude, or perhaps ‘Khalid’, may indeed be for the best.”</p><p> </p><p>“Plus he’s been fighting on Leicester’s side for years now,” Byleth pointed out, “Choosing not to trust him at this point is just stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>Erwin’s lips twitched in amusement. “Quite. Very well, I acquiesce to the wisdom of the archbishop.”</p><p> </p><p>“If I may, Lady Rhea, I do have something I wish to say,” Lorenz spoke up, frowning at Claude, who tried to smile in return.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey Lorenz, what’s up? Something the matter?”</p><p> </p><p>“Obviously there is. For the past three years, you have been lying to us, Claude. That is a significant hurdle for anyone to overcome in trusting another person,” he stated, before sighing, “Yet you are not the only one. Kronya has openly admitted to lying to us with ill-intentions, and yet we have accepted her as one of our own all the same. It would be hypocritical of me to refuse your aid at this point. I would even consider it outright foolish, given how you have proven yourself to be a competent leader through times of great upheaval.”</p><p> </p><p>"So there's no problem?" </p><p> </p><p>"The problem comes from the simple fact that not only are you a leader of the Alliance, you are also the prince of a foreign land. Regardless of your intentions, there is a clear conflict of interest if we are to aid you in becoming the King of Almyra." </p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I am still the rightful heir of House Riegan.”</p><p> </p><p>“Claude.”</p><p> </p><p>Claude sighed. “Yeah, I figured that wouldn’t work. I never really thought I’d be the King of Almyra and a noble in Fodlan at the same time, so I won’t try arguing it. You’re probably going to have a tricky time figuring out who should be the new heir of House Riegan though…which is why I’d like to ask to be able to name that heir myself.”</p><p> </p><p>Lorenz frowned, but Erwin raised a hand to stave off his son’s response. “Oh? I suppose that could be allowed, though I would implore you to name someone who actually is of Fodlan. No trying to be tricky.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, don’t worry, my pick is someone who has a distinguished bloodline, going all the way back to the very first people of Fodlan.” Claude grinned, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “As such, I’d like to formally adopt Kronya of Shambhala as my heir.”</p><p> </p><p>“What.” Lorenz flatly asked.</p><p> </p><p>“What.” Rhea echoed.</p><p> </p><p>“Her? Really?” Erwin genuinely asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“Claude, I like Kronya, but that’s a terrible idea,” Byleth stated.</p><p> </p><p>“And I graciously accept it!” Kronya declared as she pushed her way through the door to the meeting room with a huge grin on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Wh–How did you get here?!” Rhea questioned, obviously baffled by the Agarthan’s appearance.</p><p> </p><p>“I was outside the door for a while!”</p><p> </p><p>“So you were eavesdropping,” Erwin noted.</p><p> </p><p>“...Yes, and I sincerely apologize, your majesty!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Erwin’s lips twitched in faint amusement. “It would be ‘your lordship’, if you’re trying to be formal, though ‘Lord Erwin’ or ‘Count Erwin’ would be more appropriate.”</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, Count Lord Erwin!" Kronya said, much to Erwin's further amusement. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, wait, we can't just have someone with no experience in nobility as the leader of House Riegan, much less as the leader of the Alliance!" Lorenz spoke up. </p><p> </p><p>"Also it's weird for Claude to adopt Kronya since I'm pretty sure she's older than him," Byleth pointed out. </p><p> </p><p>“Age isn’t a factor in adoption, just who happens to be the head of the family. Which is me,” Claude pointed out, obviously amused, "And while Kronya might not have any experience, I'm sure I can help teach her about noble etiquette until I retire. And hey, so can you, right Lorenz?" </p><p> </p><p>“I–Wait, that–”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so like at the Academy,” Kronya noted, nodding, “Yeah, that works for me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think that is a perfectly reasonable suggestion,” Erwin spoke up, seeming curiously pleased, “I am certain my son would gladly mentor the future Duke of House Riegan. I am certain she will be a very capable head of the house, in time, though I imagine she will be unable to take the lead as sovereign of the Alliance. So it would be only natural for House Gloucester to claim such a position instead.”</p><p> </p><p>"Once I officially step down from my position as the head of House Riegan, that is,” Claude replied.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course. I imagine you’ll be more than satisfied being the King of Almyra by that point.”</p><p> </p><p>"I suppose we'll see, won't we?" Claude asked, winking at him. </p><p> </p><p>“...noble politics are weird,” Byleth commented, earning an exasperated, and commiserating, sigh from Rhea.</p><p> </p><p>"...So do I get a fancy crown?" Kronya asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Absolutely,” Claude decided, nodding.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweet.”</p><hr /><p>For the past three years, Hilda Valentine Goneril had been called upon to do what she least enjoyed doing in the entire world: actually working. </p><p> </p><p>Not only was she expected to act as her family’s representative at Roundtable meetings despite her protests that she really didn’t have the head for that kind of thing, but she’d actually been forced to fight on the frontlines against the invading Almyrans! Well, forced wasn’t exactly the right word, considering Holst probably would have been happy to keep her occupied far from the Locket if he had the option. The problem was, they genuinely didn’t have the option.</p><p> </p><p>“Fodlan’s Locket was built to beat back any Almyran army that came at it, and it’d done its job admirably for centuries. Four armies though, making repeated raids on campaigns that had lasted years by this point…well, it was said that even the wind can wear down a mountain if given enough time. Or maybe that was waves…though waves wouldn’t be by mountains, they would be cliffs at that point–”</p><p> </p><p>“Baltie, stop mangling that saying,” Hilda requested, giving her ‘bodyguard’ an annoyed look.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Ah, damn, I thought that was internal,” Balthus muttered, before shrugging as he looked out over the ramparts of the Locket’s major fort. Well, one of its major forts. Top three, at least. Maybe top five.</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you monologuing anyway? Are you planning to join a troupe or something?” she asked, standing beside him. </p><p> </p><p>“Nah, I’m just planning my memoir. Gonna hire a guy to write this tell-all story about the awesome deeds I got up to. Then I’ll rake in the dough once it gets popular!” He laughed. “Goodbye gambling debts!”</p><p> </p><p>“...don’t you need money to hire a writer in the first place?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Well yeah, but I’ve got money. You and Holst pay me, remember?”</p><p> </p><p>“And you don’t use any of that money to pay off your debts because…?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because I gotta save up to hire a writer! Besides, I already have to budget some coin for my drinks and entertainment, so I’m barely scraping by as it is!”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, whatever.” Hilda rolled her eyes at her brother’s friend, before turning her gaze back towards the distance. “...it’s also weird that you’re picking now to monologue to yourself. We’re not even facing Almyra right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well not right now, but we are still at war-”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean we’re literally faced towards Leicester because we’re waiting for the reinforcements that are supposed to arrive today.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, those guys. Well that’s probably them there. Either that or we’re about to be attacked by wyvern-riding bandits,” Balthus pointed out, gesturing towards the cluster of wyverns headed in their direction. “Ah, hey, looks like Claude’s coming along…huh. Since when did he have two white wyverns?”</p><p> </p><p>“...Baltie, I don’t think that’s a wyvern,” Hilda replied, staring at the enormous white dragon flying towards their fort.</p><p> </p><p>“...yeah. Yeah, I’m seeing it now. Alright, guess I have to ask how Claude managed to tame a dragon now.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s probably a bad idea,” Shez commented, “Rhea would definitely take it the wrong way.”</p><p> </p><p>“She would? Why would she–” Hilda stopped. She turned, staring at Shez, who was now beside her, on the opposite side from Balthus. “...how.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Oh, I warped over, thought I’d say hi. And, uh, also, sorry for being missing for these past few years, I was sort of held hostage by a crazy guy, it’s a long story, I’m fine now.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” </p><p> </p><p>“...” Balthus glanced down at Hilda, noticed her truly baffled stare, and did what any reasonable guy would do and casually pushed her towards Shez.</p><p> </p><p>Hilda stumbled a little at the sudden push…before just deciding to go with it and giving Shez a very, very tight hug. “I’m glad you’re okay.”</p><p> </p><p>"Same here," Shez said, hugging her back, before feeling something pop in her back as Hilda started hugging a bit too hard there. “Ack–T-Too tight, too tight!”</p><p> </p><p>Luckily for her, a bit of healing magic cleared that right up, and then came the fun of dealing with all the sudden guests to Hilda’s fort. Or, well, the fort she was currently in charge of.</p><p> </p><p>Still, the guests were mostly her friends, so at least she wasn’t expected to act all proper. “Oh wow. You know, I’m actually more surprised to see Leonie and Lysithea here than the professor. I get that that’s weird, but seeing Shez makes it just feel right that Professor Byleth would be here too.”</p><p> </p><p>"I'm glad to see you as well, Hilda," Byleth said, rubbing her back after her own spine-popping hug. </p><p> </p><p>"So, mind telling me what the sudden visit is for? Not that I'm complaining, but well, I am technically in charge here," Hilda said, glancing at her friends. </p><p> </p><p>"I think I can explain that, but first, there's something I need to admit to you, Hilda," Claude spoke up, facing his retainer with an uncharacteristic seriousness, "Something I've been keeping a secret from you for a long time." </p><p> </p><p>"Uh, not to interrupt, but if you're going to propose you better check in with Holst first," Balthus said, deciding to butt in. </p><p> </p><p>"Baltie!" </p><p> </p><p>"What? I'm just saying, if he doesn't, Holst will kill him. Well, he'll probably still kill him, but at least it'll be an easier death!" </p><p> </p><p>"I'm not proposing!" Claude cut in before sighing, "Right, I'm just gonna say it before Teach or someone else says it before me. My real name is Khalid, and I'm an Almyran prince." </p><p> </p><p>Hilda blinked. "Oh…Well, you heard him Baltie, you owe me gold." </p><p> </p><p>"Damn it!" </p><p> </p><p>"...what?" Claude asked, before shaking his head. "No, wait, what? What bet are you talking about?" </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, well Baltie bet you weren't Almyran and I bet that you were," Hilda said, as if it was obvious, "I mean, whenever you visit, you always stare wistfully over to Almyra, and sometimes when we're fighting against them, I hear an Almyran soldier say something about someone named Khalid, which sounded similar to your name. Then when I mentioned this to Baltie, he said there was no way you were Almyran, and decided to bet me on it. </p><p> </p><p>She paused. "Oh, but the prince thing is a surprise." </p><p> </p><p>Claude just sighed. “Right…also Rhea’s a dragon.”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s a what?!”</p><p> </p><p>“There we go! That’s a better reaction!”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea pinched the bridge of her nose. “Can we please get on with the actual important matters at hand?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you saying the archbishop isn’t important?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m saying you’re not as funny as you think you are and we have a job to do here!" </p><p> </p><p>"That we do! Mainly, dealing with the Almyrans that are invading," Claude declared, a smile on his face, "I hope you're ready to no longer be on the frontlines against the Almyrans, Hilda." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh you have no idea. I for one can't wait to be able to sleep in all day." </p><p> </p><p>"Well we just got to do a bit more work, starting with our old friend Shahid's army, and his many, many, less than loyal soldiers." </p><p> </p><p>“Just how many people do you expect are going to turn traitor?” Leonie asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“Enough to make things easy.”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea huffed. “You should know by now not to say things like that, Claude.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Do you really think I’m going to jinx–”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah bup bup!” Shez interrupted, “None of that! In fact–”</p><p> </p><p>The mercenary planted her sword into the ground, turning to her friends with a suitably dramatic grin. “I bet this will be the most fierce fight of our lives!”</p><p> </p><p>“Pfft, not even I’m going to bet on this fight being easy,” Balthus stated, and everyone there felt a strange sense of relief the instant he said that.</p><hr /><p>Byleth had to admit, it felt weird wearing Alliance armor. Not that it was bad per se, she just didn't think yellow was a good color for her. Once she had time, she'd ask if she could find someone to dye the cloth on her new armor. </p><p> </p><p>As it stood, the padded armor and chainmail would have to do. And it worked rather well as Byleth got used to fighting in such a large scale battle. Well, for the most part. </p><p> </p><p>"Hm, starting to remember why I don't wear so much armor," Byleth stated, deflecting an arrow, before slashing down on a charging spearman. </p><p> </p><p>"Aside from the fact that it leaves you all sweaty?" Hilda asked, as she slammed her axe hard enough to break through a soldier's heavy armor. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. It's too tight on my chest." </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah I totally get that. You have no idea how many complaints I've heard about how I dress for combat, but come on, I need to let the girls breathe!" </p><p> </p><p>"...You refer to your chest as girls?" </p><p> </p><p>"Well yeah, who doesn't?" </p><p> </p><p>"Huh…well, you learn something new everyday." </p><p> </p><p>“What do you call them then?”</p><p> </p><p>“My breasts. I don’t see what else I would–“ She ducked a glaive swung for her head and retaliated with a Thoron that scorched through the warrior’s chest. “–call them.”</p><p> </p><p>"I feel like I shouldn't be around for this conversation," Claude commented, before sniping an archer trying to sneak on them. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t eavesdrop then.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah Claude, have some dignity,” Hilda teased, before she raced forward and rammed her axe into and through the neck of a wyvern, decapitating the mount in one stroke and sending its rider crashing to the ground with enough force to break bones. “Speaking of no dignity, where’s that older brother of yours?”</p><p> </p><p>"We should be seeing him soon, since he tends to stick to the back of the army," Claude replied as the trio made their way through the valley as quickly as they could, cutting through the flank of the enemy's army as the main Alliance forces kept the enemy’s focus on them. Not that it was difficult to do that, considering the main Alliance force had a dragon backing them up.</p><p> </p><p>"Let's just hope this Nader guy doesn't decide to double cross you instead," Hilda remarked, swinging her axe through a barricade to crack it open before pushing through. </p><p> </p><p>"What–How did you get here!?" shouted Prince Shahid, trying his best to hide a surprised flinch at the sight of Leicester forces breaking into his outpost.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, we did leave our flanks open since you sent the army in full response to theirs," Nader the Undefeated commented, an amused smile on his face as he took in the sight of his wayward charge alongside a pair of familiar faces. </p><p> </p><p>"Well don't just stand there! Deal with this trash!" Shahid shouted at his guard. </p><p> </p><p>"Woah now, don't you want to hear what we have to say?" Claude asked. </p><p> </p><p>"As if some Fodlan coward has anything worthwhile to say to me, much less someone who looks like my half-breed brother!" Shahid responded, drawing an arrow as his wyvern roared, reading to pounce on the intruders!</p><p> </p><p>"Oh hey, aren't you that wyvern that tried to follow me before?" </p><p> </p><p>Only for the wyvern to immediately get on its haunches at Byleth’s words, causing the prince to fall off with a startled yelp. The wyvern paid no intention to that, instead letting out a chirp as it folded its wings, before laying down in a show of submission.</p><p> </p><p>“You absurd beast!” Shahid shouted, pushing himself up with an enraged glare at his mount, “What do you think you’re doing!? You’re supposed to carry me to victory, not dump me on the filthy ground!”</p><p> </p><p>The wyvern glanced at its rider, before focusing its attention back on Byleth and chirping again, making a vein pulse in Shahid’s head.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, I haven’t heard wyverns chirp that much before,” Hilda commented, letting her axe rest on her shoulder while taking note of how none of Shahid’s guards were actually moving to assist their prince.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll hear it every so often if you spend enough time around them,” Claude replied, openly amused at his brother’s misfortune, “Usually if they’re trying to pretend they’re cute, harmless, and didn’t just set fire to their stable thanks to an ill-timed sneeze.”</p><p> </p><p>Back at the fort, a certain albino wyvern twitched and cocked its head, feeling like it had just heard its master’s voice for a moment before it shrugged it off and turned back to the leather ball it had been given to play with and chew on while its master was out doing sneaky things.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth, meanwhile, casually walked up to Shahid in the middle of his angry tirade and put her sword to his throat. “I would recommend surrendering now, your highness.”</p><p> </p><p>“–worthless, just like your entire line of so-called pure breed–” Even then, it took her pushing the blade close enough for him to actually notice. </p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” Shahid blinked, before going stiff. “Gh–N-Nader! What are you doing!? Protect me!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm?” The Undefeated, who’d been idly cleaning his ear with a finger, paused and glanced down at the fallen prince. “No, I don’t think I’m going to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wh–Are you insane!? This is treason!”</p><p> </p><p>“No it’s not. I don’t have an obligation to fight for you. I’m here as an observer this time, on your father’s orders. I can’t fight for you directly because otherwise I might wind up fighting your siblings.” He grinned. “You did listen when I reported in, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Shahid hadn’t. He’d actually fully assumed Nader was there to support his conquest and hadn’t checked at all during the campaign. “Gh–Guards! Seize the Fodlaners and kill Nader for his treasonous actions!”</p><p> </p><p>“I just said why I’m not committing treason. Also, you have a sword to your throat–”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up! Guards! What do you think you’re doing!?”</p><p> </p><p>“Committing treason,” one of the guards stated quite bluntly.</p><p> </p><p>“Treason against you, specifically, your highness,” another guard added, before nodding to Claude, “We hope you’ll accept our defection, Prince Khalid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sure, come on over,” Claude replied, ignoring Shahid’s gobsmacked expression, even if a part of him did want to laugh, “I know we’re planning a pretty big victory feast after we take down the other royals, so feel free to join in.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, your highness!” the gathered guards called out, earning an amused chuckle from Nader.</p><p> </p><p>“Careful men, we don’t want to give Prince Khalid too much of a swelled head–”</p><p> </p><p>“What is going on here?!” Shahid finally snapped, sheer indignation breaking through his confusion.</p><p> </p><p>"Why dear brother, that's simple. I'm making my own claim," Claude said, before drawing an arrow and aiming it at Shahid, "As Prince Khalid of Almyra, I order you to stand down, Prince Shahid." </p><p> </p><p>"...You,” Shahid growled, his hands clenching to the ground beneath him, "All this time, you've been hiding here of all places!?" </p><p> </p><p>"I'd prefer to say ‘biding my time’. Not that it matters. What does matter is you either bow out of your own volition or we deal with you, right now." </p><p> </p><p>"As if I'd–!" Shahid shouted, only to get cut off as Byleth grabbed his collar, yanking him to the side as an arrow grazed his cheek. Blood began to leak down the wound as Shahid stared, shocked and stunned. “Y-You…”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. Did you need to do that, Teach?” Claude asked, his attention on Byleth, “I don’t think anyone here would’ve minded if I put an end to his ambitions permanently.”</p><p> </p><p>“Would you have been okay with it?” Byleth questioned in turn, earning a huff from Claude.</p><p> </p><p>“Believe me, Shahid’s not exactly worth keeping alive after everything he’s done. This ass has been stubbornly charging at the same wall over and over again for years now. He doesn’t have value as a hostage and he’ll cause more problems if we let him go. It’s better to end things here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay with that?” she repeated.</p><p> </p><p>“...I’d been working up the nerve on the way here. Feels like a waste if I don’t go through with it.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do Almyrans think of fratricide?” She glanced back at Nader. “Fodlaners don’t really like it, but I’ve seen nobles be ordered to kill their siblings before.”</p><p> </p><p>Hilda paused. “You have? When–Oh, the thing with Sylvain’s brother?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm hm.”</p><p> </p><p>Nader, meanwhile, shrugged. “Prince Shahid made his choice when he came to the battlefield. If Khalid wants to off him himself, that’s up to him. If he were just a Fodlander then the king would have to respond, but if this is a battle between siblings…well, there'll certainly be fallout, but nothing you have to worry about." </p><p> </p><p>"..." Letting out a breath, Byleth let go of Shahid, and took a step away as Claude drew another arrow. </p><p> </p><p>"W-Wait, you can't be serious!" Shahid shouted as he tried to back away, stumbling and failing to get to his feet.</p><p> </p><p>"It’s up to you, Shahid,” Claude stated, coldly and calmly, “Give up and accept you’re not going to be king. That’s your only way out of this.”</p><p> </p><p>"...They'll never accept you. Even if you win here, nothing will change about you being a worthless half-breed!" </p><p> </p><p>"Then I suppose you'll just have to see me succeed from hell." </p><p> </p><p>An arrow flew, whistling through the air before ending with sharp squelch, then a thud as a body fell. </p><p> </p><p>“...” Hilda put a hand on Claude’s back. </p><p> </p><p>He let out a slow sigh as he lowered his bow. “Let’s hope my other siblings aren’t as stubborn.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hopefully,” Byleth murmured. A part of her wondered if she could have done something more to prevent what happened, but…the most she could think of was just killing Shahid herself. And she wasn’t sure if Claude would take that any better. </p><p> </p><p>Though that thought made her wonder just how Shez and everyone else was doing on their part of the mission. She’d like to check in on them, but she couldn’t travel as rapidly as Shez could. Not without some kind of steed or…</p><p> </p><p>She looked over at the bowed wyvern. The wyvern immediately lowered its gaze to avoid provoking her.</p><p> </p><p>“…hm. Hey, Claude, I’m taking this wyvern.”</p><p> </p><p>"Huh?" Was all Claude could before Byleth hopped on the wyvern, grabbing its reins and taking to the skies in a sudden burst of speed. “...hm. Is it just me, or does Teach seem more emotional than usual?”</p><p> </p><p>“Pretty sure she’s feeling weird,” Hilda replied, shrugging, “It happens.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. How much do you want to bet she’s running off to check on Shez?”</p><p> </p><p>Hilda huffed. “I’m not Baltie, Claude. I don’t take obviously bad bets.”</p><p> </p><p>"Sure you don't," Claude said, before looking at Shahid's corpse, "...For now, I guess I have to get ready for whatever happens."</p><hr /><p>Flying was an interesting sensation for Byleth. The air flowing past her hair felt…almost right, though she chose to ignore that as she guided Bitey towards where a familiar purple flash flicked around the battlefield. </p><p> </p><p>Shez seemed to be handling herself well, pushing the princess Farah back while clearly not going for the killing blow. Byleth took a moment to observe the princess, who did resemble her brothers in terms of hair and skin color, with a lean figure decorated by a scale mail hauberk, violet cloth, and gold gauntlets and boots. Her long hair was braided with gold thread and she was riding a wyvern while wielding an axe, which briefly reminded Byleth of Edelgard…and she wasn’t going to think about that right now because she needed to commit to the plan.</p><p> </p><p>A part of her wanted to leap into battle, to join her sister in taking down the princess, but she wasn’t going to be overprotective again. Shez could handle herself.</p><p> </p><p>And she did, taking advantage of the princess’s wyvern overextending itself and warping up into the saddle to kick Farah off, sending her crashing into the dirt right before Shez jumped off and landed straight on her. Her feet impacted the princess’s chest, driving the air from her lungs, before Shez stabbed her swords into the ground on either side of Farah’s head and gave her a cheeky grin.</p><p> </p><p>“And that’s that, your highness! Looks like you lose!”</p><p> </p><p>"Geh…what are you waiting for then? Finish what you started," Farah demanded, glaring up at her. </p><p> </p><p>"No can do! I'm supposed to take you out, but killing is a no go," Shez replied, before pausing when she heard the flapping of wings. With a quick glance, she saw Byleth approaching, "Oh, Byleth, you got things settled already?" </p><p> </p><p>"Claude did, at least," </p><p> </p><p>"...That’s Shahid's wyvern. So he has been struck down," Farah muttered, before staring up at Shez, "You have already struck down an Almyran prince, so it won't be long until Father retaliates, and I hold no use as a hostage–”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, shut up,” Shez ordered, “You’re not here as a hostage–Wait, is she a hostage? I think it’s more like a prisoner than a hostage.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think it’s more like a catch and release thing,” Byleth replied, shrugging, “Claude is going to talk to them and get this sorted out so he can be king.”</p><p> </p><p>Farah, who had already been quite offended to be ordered to ‘shut up’ by some random, albeit skilled, Fodlan soldier, blinked at that. “You–What?! A savage from Fodlan can’t become the king of Almyra!”</p><p> </p><p>“Claude can,” Shez responded, “He’s Khalid.”</p><p> </p><p>“...what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Claude is Khalid. Oh, right, I guess you don’t have context for that. So you know who Khalid is, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I do! He’s my craven brother who ran away from home!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, no, he was actually over here fighting wars and stuff. I think he put it as ‘winning in my mother’s homeland so I can claim my father’s’ or something like that.” Shez shrugged, standing and sheathing her swords. “He’ll explain it better.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I…you…what?” Farah managed to ask, openly baffled.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, up you go,” Shez insisted, holding her hand out to the bewildered princess to help her up. “The sooner we finish up this battle, the sooner we get a victory feast. Which, hey, I’m pretty sure you’re invited if you need some extra incentive.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” After a moment’s hesitation, Farah slowly took Shez’s hand and allowed herself to be pulled up. And then she took a second to consider how strong the Fodlan warrior clearly was, as evidenced by her firm grip, and made a few quick mental calculations. “...are you a noble of Fodlan?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Uh, not really? My dad is captain of the Knights of Seiros though–Wait, hang on…Hey, Byleth? Rhea’s our grandma, right? If she’s still the archbishop, does that make us nobles?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth considered that question, then shrugged. “Probably not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, probably not.”</p><p> </p><p>Farah just stared for a moment. “...the granddaughter of Fodlan’s ruler would be sufficient.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? Oh, Rhea’s not the ruler, she’s like…wait, what do you mean ‘sufficient’?”</p><p> </p><p>“You are of sufficient rank to be a viable consort.”</p><p> </p><p>“...what.”</p><p> </p><p>“She already has a fiance,” Byleth chimed in.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, a pity.” Farah glanced over at Byleth, ignoring Shez’s blatant confusion. “What about you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I have two fiances.”</p><p> </p><p>“Damn,” Farah muttered, before looking over at Byleth for a moment. "...They would not be willing to travel and live in Almyra?" </p><p> </p><p>"One of them is the Emperor, so that's not really an option." </p><p> </p><p>"Hm. How annoying,” she grumbled, before pausing. “Fodlan has an emperor? I thought you were led by a series of independent lords that bow to your religious leader, the ‘archbishop’.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, no? You guys do know Fodlan is three different nations, right?” Shez asked.</p><p> </p><p>“...It seems my education has some gaps in it.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth immediately perked up, her eyes practically gleaming. “I can answer any questions you might have.”</p><p> </p><p>“...By, you can’t recruit her for the Black Eagles,” Shez pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“The Deer have two Almyrans in their class, I can recruit one if she is willing to join.”</p><p> </p><p>Farah raised an eyebrow. “...is this a cult?”</p><p> </p><p>“Better. It’s a student house at the Garreg Mach Officer’s Academy,” Byleth readily explained, moving to Farah’s side to help support her, “You see, the academy has its attending students divide into three houses–”</p><p> </p><p>Shez, meanwhile, just sighed. Somehow, she felt like this was going to reawaken some kind of old rivalry, though whether it was going to be between the Eagles and the Deer or between Claude and his sister, she wasn’t sure. Might be both, now that she considered it…</p><p> </p><p>Well, at least Byleth seemed happy.</p>

  <span>“Gotta admit, I thought it’d be harder to take down four Almyran royals,” Shez commented as she helped dice some vegetables in the main fort’s kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah? Why’s that?” Raphael asked, trying his best to keep his eyes on Shez and not on all the food being prepared. His distractedness was understandable though; the big guy had worked up an appetite after spending his initial reunion with his friends beating the crap out of a bunch of Almyran soldiers in between his group and the pair of remaining Almyran princes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, they’re from a major nation outside of Fodlan’s borders, right? One with a whole ‘warrior culture’ thing going on,” Shez elaborated, “I figured that would mean they’re all a bunch of badasses that would take, I dunno, about a few months of effort to corner and defeat. Not a day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ohh, now I get what you mean. Yeah, I guess I can understand why you’d be confused. Or are you disappointed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…I don’t know, maybe? I think I was expecting some kind of…epic clash, the kind that sagas are written about, and instead I hear Shahid got killed without me doing anything, the twins were taken down by your team, and Farah is just flirting with my sister because apparently she likes shorter women?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Shorter women are easier to pick up,” Raphael noted, looking thoughtful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well yeah, I know that. Lysithea is really easy to carry. Same for Kronya, though she gets all squirmy. That’s not really my point though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…oh, I just thought of something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aref and Aziz aren’t twins. Aref is three years older.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...that’s not exactly…huh, really? They look so similar though…” Shez considered this new information, then just shrugged. “Eh, I’ll keep calling them twins because it’s easier. They can correct me if it’s a problem.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You can always ask them if it's a problem when we take food over to them. Hm, do you think they'd tell me about Almyran food?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You could always ask Claude." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh yeah that's true," Raphael said, a smile on his face as he continued to watch the food. “...so hey, do you want me to help out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can you cook anything other than salted meat?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? What else would I need to make?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez chuckled, ignoring one of the fort’s actual cooks as the guy huffed in annoyance. “I think our friends and guests would probably want something more than that, yeah. Hm…maybe I could show you how to cook other stuff sometime? If you’re up for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, that sounds great! Though I think you’re underestimating the tastiness of pure meat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Raph, buddy, I can absolutely show you how to cook even tastier meat than just salted jerky. Here, how about we move over? We can let these guys cook while we start practicing,” she suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And while one Eisner sister began teaching her friend how to cook, the other was busy “guarding” a trio of Almyran royals. Though anyone who happened to look in on her makeshift classroom would probably say she was doing more lecturing than guarding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–so of the official Fodlan nations, the Leicester Alliance, marked here in yellow, is technically the ‘youngest’, though the nobility that makes up its leadership can trace their lineage back to the Ten Elites,” Byleth explained, gesturing to the map of Fodlan she’d marked, “This is part of what gives the Great Houses, most recently made up of the noble houses Riegan, Gloucester, Goneril, Edmund, and Ordelia, their justification to make decisions for the rest of Leicester. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“However, it should be noted that House Edmund was actually raised to a Great House based on merit and wealth, and they do not have their own crest named after them. Similarly, House Ordelia also lacks a specific named crest, and instead traditionally bears the crest of House Charon, a Faerghus noble house. The reason for that actually goes back several hundred years, but before we get into anything like that, I would like to ask if you have any questions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Immediately, hands raised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t Consort Tiana from House Riegan?” Aziz asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To my knowledge, yes, she is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“House Goneril is the one that maniac Holst is from, correct?” Aref questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t call him a maniac, but yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you certain you’re not available for marriage?” Farah inquired.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not. Sorry.” Byleth responded, biting back a sigh, "My apologies, Farah but aside from already being with someone else, I don't really know you that well." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So if you were to get to know me, perhaps on a date, marriage would be on the table?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I did not say that," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yet as an instructor, is it not your duty to aid your students as best you can, and to do that you must get to know them, correct?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t harass this instructor too, Farah,” Aref chided. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This is why you can’t retain any of your staff,” Aziz commented, earning a huff from Farah.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You make it sound like I’m some dirty old man.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The brothers shared a glance. “In spirit, if not body.” “You do have certain tendencies.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your words are lies and slander, and I will absolutely have vengeance for this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Please refrain from arguing or you'll get detention," Byleth stated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't think you can give hostages detention," Claude noted, walking into the makeshift classroom, "Also pretty sure said hostages shouldn't have their arms unbound." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don't worry, I can handle them if they try anything. Aref can attest to that." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The prince in question nodded, choosing not to draw attention to the purple bruise around his eye. “I would also point out, younger brother, that you have a dragon that razed half our forces, and a maniac that slaughtered the other half alongside his band of shockingly muscular Fodlaners.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Raphael did get along with Holst and Balthus surprisingly well. Byleth wouldn’t be surprised if the trio of muscular Leicester men just bonded through flexing. She was pretty sure that was how male friendships worked anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That doesn't mean I'll be dropping my guard around you three." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You would be wise not to. Even if you have defeated me, that does not mean I accept you as the future King of Almyra," Farah noted, staring at Claude, "You may have won this time, little brother, yet you should not expect all those who follow you to remain loyal, lest you have a close ally turn traitor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh don't worry about me, I can handle myself, especially with someone like Teach by my side. Right, Teach?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hm? Oh, well, sure. While I'm around anyways. Not sure how long I'll be staying though," Byleth admitted, shrugging.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you really had to undercut my point, huh Teach?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I’m not your professor. You’re part of the Deer, remember?” She tilted her head, thinking. “Maybe you should ask Manuela? I don’t think she’ll say yes, but maybe she’ll be interested in seeing what Almyra is like.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Claude just sighed. “How about we stop talking about my plans for the future? Let’s focus on what the rest of you are going to do going forward, and why it’s going to involve staying out of my way and letting me take the throne.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. Do you really think our own nobility will gladly hand over the throne to you, Khalid?” Farah questioned, glaring at her brother, “You do realize it is not merely a matter of foreign blood that causes them to question your capabilities, don’t you? You have no connections to the great lords of Almyra and no ties that bind you to our kingdom. No betrothal, no sponsorship, and no true prospects amid a court that already thinks poorly of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh please, I knew all of that already,” Claude countered, his usual smirk back in place, “Farah, I’ve been planning how I’m going to take Almyra’s throne from the first moment I saw our father sitting on it. Trust me or don’t, but dealing with Fodlan was the tricky part. Bringing Almyra to heel? Give me a </span>
  <em>
    <span>year</span>
  </em>
  <span> and I’ll have everyone from Odaenathus to Zabdas bowing their heads to their new king.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are those regions in Almyra?” Byleth asked, interrupting Farah before she could reply, “Actually…hm. Claude, do you have any books on Almyra? The library at the monastery didn’t have many books on foreign countries and they were sparse on details.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Teach, I am completely willing to hook you up with books the church doesn’t want you to read later, but I was sort of having a staredown with my sister here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sorry.” Byleth glanced at Farah. “I’m invested in making Claude king of Almyra because it will make things easier for all of us. Please don’t get in the way of that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Farah narrowed her eyes. “...Marry me-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Damn…very well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>if</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and only if, that option is entirely off the table…do you know anyone similar to you who may be interested in marrying a foreign princess?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth tilted her head in thought. “...Manuela is single.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You mentioned her earlier. She is another professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yup.” Byleth paused, thinking of what qualities Farah might like. “Hm…her boobs are also bigger than mine-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, we’re ending that conversation now,” Claude decided.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t mind continuing it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do mind, so we’re stopping it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are all Fodlaners perverts?” Aref murmured, leaning towards Aziz while Claude tried to direct the conversation in a direction that didn’t involve setting up his former professor with his sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His brother shrugged. “They do seem more immodest. That Goneril girl was practically baring her chest, and some of the outfits they wear are…well, they have a different culture. Sure, it might be worse than ours, but we should respect that while they hold us under the threat of death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Wise words of wisdom indeed.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The remaining clean-up of the Almyran forces went quickly once the news of Prince Khalid’s appearance and the four royals’ defeats began to spread, and soon enough, the forces of the Alliance, and the Knights of Seiros, to a lesser extent, gathered together for a grand feast to celebrate their victory!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Gotta say, it feels nice being able to have a big celebration again," Shez said, lifting a mug of ale in the air, knocking it against Byleth’s as she raised hers in return. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Feels nice being able to drink again, at least," Byleth replied before she drank hers, "Mm. Speaking of, how long have you been drinking alcohol? Last I remember, Papa didn't let you." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That was three years ago, I can drink if I want," Shez retorted, letting out a huff as she took a big swig of hers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Fair enough. Either way, I'm looking forward to finishing up here and going to the Empire." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Eh? I thought we were going to take Garreg Mach first?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth sighed, looking genuinely despondent. “Right…maybe Rhea and the knights could handle that on their own…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, no need to mope. I could do it myself–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not letting you out of my sight for at least a year.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...that’s going to make some stuff awkward.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know what I mean.” Byleth huffed. "I just want to be able to see all of the Eagles again." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on Byleth, it's not that bad." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're just saying that cause you have your girlfriends." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wh–No I'm not–" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"They fed you grapes, whatever you say is invalid," Byleth cut off, before downing her mug of ale in one go. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so you’re jealous, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth gave her amused sister the most annoyed look she could manage. “Shut up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m just saying,” Shez said, not even bothering to hide her grin, “You have been complaining a lot–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut. Up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I seem to recall you saying they were both your fiancees? Right? Which is kinda weird, because I’m not sure when you would have ever asked them to marry you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m getting more ale.” Byleth got up from the bench, ignoring her smug sister and her stupid giggles in favor of trying to find the nearest barrel of alcohol. Which was more difficult than expected because the fort’s dining hall was full of people, to the point of the celebration spilling out of the fort and into the surrounding mountaintop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The addition of the Almyrans alongside the Alliance forces was probably at fault for that, though it was nice seeing everyone alongside one another, eating, drinking, and making merry. There might have been some tension in the air at some point, but Holst and Nader, who were currently in the midst of another arm wrestling match in front of a cheering crowd of burly men, did a lot to make that tension disappear into a festive atmosphere. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eventually though, she managed to find a barrel of ale that hadn't been emptied, mainly thanks to Rhea seemingly keeping it for herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you mind if I have some?" Byleth asked as the archbishop downed a mug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Byleth," Rhea said, her cheeks slightly pinked as she looked over, "Go ahead. Just don't take it all." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No promises," Byleth muttered, filling her mug up again before drinking. “Mm…so, the plan is to go to Garreg Mach next?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I need the monastery back if I am to begin repairing the damage Fodlan has suffered,” she stated, “I owe it to Mother–...I owe it to the people of Fodlan to right the wrongs I have allowed to linger for far too long.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stared at her for a moment, then shrugged and took another drink. “Mm. Just make sure you don’t try to do everything yourself. It’s fine to rely on other people and trying to solve your problems on your own makes you vulnerable to missing the important stuff. I made that mistake and got trapped in the void.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I know, Byleth. I was with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you were, so make sure to remember that lesson.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea just sighed. “I have to admit, I am surprised you are so against returning to the monastery with how obviously you enjoy the idea of teaching again. Were you not aiming to recruit that Almyran princess to your class earlier?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shook her head. “I already mentioned my relationships with Edelgard and Dorothea to you. I need to make sure they’re fine before I consider my future plans.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And those plans include recruiting foreign royalty to your class?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Potentially. I’m not sure if I’ll still be teaching at the monastery after we’re done with everything or if I’ll accept that offer from Edelgard to become her advisor…assuming that offer is still open. I don’t think she would rescind it, but either way, I’m figuring things out as I go and I think I’ll be able to make better plans once I know all of my loved ones are safe.” She took another drink, before nodding to herself. “This conversation is getting too heavy for a celebration. Pick a different topic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, er…I…do you have anything in mind?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…what do you call your breasts?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...what.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One moment.” Byleth stood up and searched the crowd for a hint of pink hair. “Hm…ah, there. HILDA, COME OVER HERE! I NEED YOU TO PROVIDE CONTEXT!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A moment later, a very confused Hilda Goneril walked over. “Uh, what’s up, Byleth? Why’d you shout across the party like that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tell Rhea what you call your breasts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, so that’s what this is about…uh, professor, I think you had too much to drink–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have a high tolerance for alcohol. I think.” She glanced at Rhea. “Do Nabateans have a high alcohol tolerance?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…yes, of course,” Rhea lied, “All of us have a naturally high tolerance for alcohol.” Then Byleth’s words registered. “Wait, don’t…don’t say that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Say what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The naba-word! You cannot–We are supposed to keep it a secret!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rhea, you turned into a dragon in front of everyone,” Byleth reminded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea glanced at Hilda, who was honestly just confused by this conversation and kind of hoping she could find an excuse to leave. “Hm. You still shouldn’t…oh, never mind. What were we even talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth wracked her brain. “...breasts?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmm…breasts are nice, I suppose. I do find them appealing,” she admitted with a shrug before pouring herself another drink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Hm…so do you have anyone you like romantically? Because I might have tried to set up Manuela with that Almyran princess, so I’m not sure if she’s still an option.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...why would you do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Manuela has made it obvious that she wants to marry somebody so I’m trying to come up with good options for her. Part of me kind of wants to match up everyone I know so they’re all paired together. I’m not sure why, but it makes my brain feel good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re trying to be a matchmaker?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe? It would be nice if everyone had someone to love.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. You do not need another person in your life to be fulfilled, Byleth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you say that, but you spent a thousand years trying to resurrect one specific person so you could feel fulfilled.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, and that was a bad idea, so now I have chosen to simply work on fixing things. After everything is said and done, perhaps I will explore self-improvement as well and try to find ways in which I can become a richer person on my own, without a dependence on my mother’s validation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Mm…okay. I can respect that. I might forget about this conversation and try pushing someone at you if I think they’re good though, so consider this a warning in advance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea sighed. “I suppose that is the best I can hope for…hm, right, Hilda, I apologize for ignoring–” The archbishop blinked, finally noticing the noblewoman had left a while ago. “Ah. I suppose that’s…hm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, across the party, Shez huffed in amusement at the sight of Rhea’s bewildered expression. “Oh come on, I’m sure it’s fine if we let those two keep drinking. They might be fumbling a little, but they’re not hurting anyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well they might hurt their reputations if they keep loudly talking about tits like that,” Leonie commented, equally amused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea let out an exasperated sigh, something she found she was doing more and more often these days. “I would prefer it if you stop them </span>
  <em>
    <span>before</span>
  </em>
  <span> they do anything worse than chat about breasts in a public place.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like what?” Shez asked, still more amused than concerned, “C’mon, it’s Byleth and Rhea. They’re not exactly party animals.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I ever heard of Rhea even going near a party,” Leonie remarked, still watching the pair for a moment before turning her attention to her friends, “More importantly, how are things going to play out with Claude now? Sure, he’s apparently stepping down from being Duke so he can throw his hat in the ring for being the King of Almyra, but what’s that mean for everyone else? Is he going to help us with taking on the rest of our enemies or are we on our own?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s...yeah, those are good questions. I know Claude is trying to do something clever by making Kronya the new duke, though I’m not sure how he’s going to pull that off. Heck, I’m pretty sure he’s trying to get Count Gloucester to handle things for him, though I’m not sure how that works either.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Count Erwin wants to become the new head of the Alliance and Claude is essentially handing that position to him,” Lysithea explained, frowning, “He has chosen Kronya to be his ‘heir’ because he knows she is not prepared to run anything and he is letting Count Erwin, or more likely Lorenz, instruct her in the ways of the nobility because it lets House Gloucester hold power over House Riegan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez narrowed her eyes. “So he’s making Kronya his patsy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is one way to describe it, I suppose. I can’t guess exactly what Claude wants, but I wouldn’t put it past him to play to Count Erwin’s ambitions to the point of letting his own house fall in standing, just so he can get an advantage somewhere down the line.” She tilts her head thoughtfully. “In fact, placing a weak leader in House Riegan during a time of crisis, right after House Ordelia has officially dissolved means the Alliance might go through some very rough changes in the future…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...well shit,” Leonie responded, summing up the situation quite concisely. “...does this mean we need to kill Claude to stop his evil plan?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s too late at this point for his death to change anything,” Lysithea pointed out, “I’m not saying no though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am,” Shez spoke up, “We’re not killing our friends, guys. And I’m pretty sure you’re the ones who should stop drinking if you’re seriously considering it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was a joke, Shez. Mostly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We could always just beat him up,” Leonie offered, obviously amused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez did consider that offer slightly more seriously though, before shaking her head. “No, that would still be a dick move. It would probably cause more problems than it would solve if we beat him up too badly. As is, we should just get ready to move out towards Garreg Mach.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, that's a pretty important place to take. Haven't heard much about it other than those weird knights who started living near it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, they're probably going to be a problem, but hey, won't be the first time we've dealt with a problem. And besides, I've dealt with worse knights,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Who?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The banging of a door cut off Shez as the trio looked over to see a familiar knight rushing in. “Lady Rhea, I'm so glad to see you're okay!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Her,” Shez grumbled, frowning as she watched Catherine approach Rhea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? You have an issue with Catherine? I know she can be a bit much but I didn't think she was that bad,” Leonie asked, glancing at Catherine, who seemed to be fussing over the inebriated Rhea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It's a long story, and one I'm not in the mood to get into. What matters is that even if Byleth forgave her, I haven't.” Shez huffed, as she finished off her mug. “Ugh, maybe it would be worth it to go to the Empire instead…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Surely it couldn't be any worse than dealing with Catherine. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Edelgard von Hresvelg was frankly having one of the worst battles of her life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was supposed to be simple. While the Knights of Reclamation didn't seem to be the most reliable force around, they would provide the necessary back-up her forces needed to take back the Eastern portion of Adrestia seized by Aegir and the armies of Hrym. She would have preferred if the entire Reclamation force helped, but she couldn't quite complain about the back-up they received in their clash at Fort Merceus.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn't sure how to feel about Ludwig von Aegir being a tough opponent, but it wasn’t as though the arrogant “archduke” could take the full credit for his army’s success. No, the real pain in her ass had to be the enormous, bulky foes resembling suits of armor with a large shield on their left arms and sharp blades on their rights who could send a squad of knights flying with a single swing, as well as a magical armament perched atop the fort’s walls that seemed to be able to rain down lightning across the entire battlefield. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Edie!” At Dorothea’s shout, the Emperor moved to the side, evading a thoron that crashed into one of the living suits of armor, causing it to jerk for a moment, and giving Edelgard the chance she needed to smash her axe into it. The sacred blade of Labraunda smashed into the Agarthan symbol on its chest and split open the stone there, causing blue sparks to spray from the twitching titan before it crashed to the ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A cheer sounded up from her troops and their allies at the sight of one of their foes crashing into the dirt, but Edelgard couldn’t share their enthusiasm. One enemy felled didn’t make a battle won and the principality’s forces were far more entrenched and fortified than she preferred. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fort Merceus was always going to be a difficult target to take. It was meant to be the Empire’s last line of defense against invaders from the north, and having it turned on her certainly rankled an admittedly proud part of Edelgard. She’d been looking for a way in ever since it was first taken by the Agarthans and if Hubert had any luck at all, the gates should be opening enough for them to make a proper push in any moment now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then they didn’t, and Edelgard felt a scowl come to her face once the allotted time for Hubert’s plan ran out. She buried down the tinge of worry she felt for her close confidant and head of her household, steeling herself as she raised her voice. “FALL BACK! WE NEED TO RETREAT AND REGROUP!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The order spread quickly and she was gratified to see Ferdinand using his cavalry to rapidly relay it to their forces. There was a shift in the battlefield as her army moved into defensive formations, blocking the enemy’s spells and arrows while they hurried back into cover.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hubie didn’t come through?” Dorothea asked, a frown on her face as she looked worriedly at the walls.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s possible the entrances were discovered. We’ll have to rethink things.” It would be a setback, but not an impossible one. Hubert was skilled at getting out of difficult situations so she was confident she would see her spymaster soon enough; once she made sure everyone was fine, they could look for another way at striking at the fort.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ferdinand returned to them soon enough, a frown on his face as he took in their retreating forces. It wasn’t a rout by any means, and if they maneuvered properly, they could draw some of the enemy into another counterattack, so at least the assault wouldn’t be wasted. “A sudden retreat like this might be bad for morale, Edelgard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m aware. It would be worse to waste our forces on a direct assault we have no chance of succeeding at.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know. The problem is, there are more people on our side that will take this badly–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Emperor Edelgard!” Ladislava called out from atop her wyvern, bringing it close, “The Knights of Reclamation are still trying to push the attack, they aren’t obeying the order to retreat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard grimaced. “Of course they aren’t. Stubborn fools…Ferdinand, speak to their commander, get him to see reason.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Understood, your majesty! I’ll have them following us before the enemy has a chance to realize there was a problem to begin with!” he replied with all his usual pomp and chivalry, earning an amused huff from Dorothea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, I was wondering why you decided he should stick around here instead of heading the second team with Monnie, but I’m starting to get it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He would be a decent commander,” Edelgard admitted, “But right now, I need him close by. He’s better at talking with the former church knights than Monica would be.” It helped that he and Flayn were close. The young Nabatean was already helping out a great deal in her role as the Southern Bishop, even if her new position had annoyed the cardinal leading the Reclamation forces. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something about “overstepping her bounds”, as though a holy man of a defunct church had any authority to speak of.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He does balance out Hubie better too,” Dorothea noted, before giving her emperor a glance, “Do you think Monnie’s group has a good chance of taking Varley county back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’ll have a better chance if we can keep Ludwig and his allies focused on us, and taking Fort Merceus will guarantee the archduke can’t look anywhere else. Which means we’ll just have to do our best to seize it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A siege wasn’t broken by just one loss, even if it was grating to see the ‘Stubborn Old General’ standing strong. She really would have preferred to take the damn fort in a single battle, the way her professor would have if she’d been here.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard sighed. It was times like this that she really missed Byleth.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Byleth had to admit, she thought the day she returned to Garreg Mach would be a happier occasion. </p><p> </p><p>It’d been three years since she last set foot on the stones of the monastery, and the last time she had been there had been…rough, to say the least. So a part of her couldn’t help but think that her eventual return to the academy would be a pleasant experience. Perhaps bittersweet, at most, but still overall triumphant.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, she wasn’t actually at Garreg Mach at the moment. Really, she could only barely be considered to be beginning her journey towards Garreg Mach, on account of the fact that there were still tons of things to do in the Alliance. So instead of an immediate journey to reclaim the monastery, she woke up that morning with a pounding headache and a dry mouth due to overindulging with drinking the night before, and then had to sit through a meeting about <em> how </em> they would actually be taking Garreg Mach back.</p><p> </p><p>And by this point, she’d heard the name “Garreg Mach” so many times that she was pretty sure it stopped being a word.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Eisner, pay attention!” Catherine called out, scowling at her from across the room and not helping things in the slightest. But then the blonde had never been a particularly helpful person in Byleth’s life. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m paying attention,” Byleth responded, trying her best not to glare at the loud blonde. It didn’t help that Rhea was sitting at the head of the table, looking completely serene despite the fact that Byleth knew she drank more than her. She was pretty sure the archbishop had cheated with healing magic or something…which raised the question in Byleth’s head of why she herself hadn’t used healing magic to fix her problem. And now she was feeling stupid–</p><p> </p><p>“Then what did I just say?” <em> Oh, she’s still talking. </em></p><p> </p><p>Byleth glanced at the board, then extrapolated what the knight was probably talking about. “We’re going to Garreg Mach to take it back from the people that took it. That’s our first priority so it’s where we’ll put the majority of our focus. Alois and Shamir are already heading here so we’ll meet with them first, then probably take Rhea and some wyverns to get there quickly, whereupon we will bring down the wrath of the goddess or something like that.</p><p> </p><p>“After that, we can talk to the Knights of Reclamation at Zanado. Going to them first will overcomplicate things and cause a delay, and ideally we’ll get this all done today so we don’t have to worry about it further,” she finished, turning her gaze back to Catherine, “Correct?”</p><p> </p><p>“...that…well, we were planning to scout the area first before committing to an attack,” she replied, looking a little put out.</p><p> </p><p>“...no you weren’t. You prefer going right for the attack. I guess you could have changed over the past few years, or my understanding of your personality isn’t as full as I thought, but my impression of you is that you’re just as impatient to take back the monastery as Rhea is because you view it as a personal insult that it was taken under your watch in the first place.”</p><p> </p><p>Catherine’s eyes narrowed, before she huffed in annoyance. “Smartass…alright, <em> professor </em>, what’s your plan for dealing with the demonic beasts and bandits that have taken over the monastery?”</p><p> </p><p>“Target the beasts first and use the elites in our group to eliminate all of them, preferably in small squads of four to compensate for weaknesses, before displaying the beasts’ corpses as a method of demoralizing the bandits into surrendering.” She paused, a thought occurring. “Are we intending to take the bandits alive? Because that could be to our benefit if it means we won’t have to fight to kill them all.”</p><p> </p><p>“If they are occupying the monastery, I would prefer if no quarter was given to them,” Rhea remarked, looking understandably displeased at the thought of invaders taking over her home.</p><p> </p><p>“Right, but people who think they have a chance to live will surrender if the option is offered. Otherwise we might be looking at a much bloodier battle.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do we really want to take them alive though?” Hilda spoke up, sounding as annoyed as Byleth felt. Potentially more so because the main reason she was even in this meeting was that Claude and Holst were busy. “They’d probably get executed for banditry anyway, right? That and it’d be a waste of time to put them in any cells because, again, they’re probably going to die anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>“Since when are you so bloodthirsty?” Leonie asked, raising an eyebrow at her friend. As a random mercenary she probably wouldn’t have been invited to a meeting like this, but Hilda used the excuse that Leonie was her bodyguard. That and there was no way Leonie was going to be left out of a meeting about going to find Jeralt.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not, I just find it dumb to worry about bandits when there are way more important things to be thinking about.”</p><p> </p><p><em> Like finding Marianne </em>, Byleth thought but didn’t say. She could empathize with the noble’s feelings; she really wanted to see her students again. Particularly the two that managed to capture her unbeating heart…</p><p> </p><p>“We’re just trying to clear out the monastery as quickly as possible. If that means taking prisoners or even letting some of the bandits escape, then we should allow for those options,” Byleth reiterated, “The important part is securing the monastery. How we do that doesn’t matter as much as getting it done.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’d say the way we take the monastery back <em> does </em> matter as much as taking it back,” Catherine retorted, earning a blank stare from Byleth.</p><p> </p><p>“…if you’re arguing with me just for the sake of it, I’m going to punch you.”</p><p> </p><p>“What, you can’t handle someone having a dissenting opinion?”</p><p> </p><p>“…” Byleth narrowed her eyes. “Nothing you do or say will change the fact that Rhea likes me more than you.”</p><p> </p><p>“…”</p><p> </p><p>Hilda whistled, impressed. “Wow, I didn’t think the professor had a catty side.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’d be surprised,” Leonie remarked, trying to hide the fact that she was just as surprised.</p><p> </p><p>“Byleth, Catherine, now is not the time to argue,” Rhea spoke up, trying to be a voice of reason between the two glaring women, “Obviously I do have a greater affection for Byleth because she is family to me, but–“</p><p> </p><p>Byleth did wind up punching Catherine in the face, but only because the blonde punched her first.</p><hr /><p>“Gotta say, I didn’t expect to achieve my goals like this,” Claude remarked, looking out over the grounds of the fort, where Alymyran soldiers milled about Leicester troops, chatting and working with one another in preparation for their return home. And, of course, for the next battles ahead.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” Shez asked, glancing at him from her own place on the wall.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean as I say.” He sighed, letting his tone get wistful. “I grew up with a sword hanging over my head. Everyone around me knew that I was some half-breed brat with the lowest chance of ever sitting on the throne, and they made sure I knew it.</p><p> </p><p>“Then in just one battle, all of my biggest rivals were taken down and I went from no chance at all to a practical guarantee that the throne is going to be mine. That’s all it took. One battle, and I have everything I ever dreamed of.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez nodded, looking thoughtful at her friend’s honesty. “And now that you have everything you want, you’re not sure if you’re okay with it being so easy?” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh not at all, I love that it was this easy,” Claude denied, letting a big grin spread across his face, “Just thinking about how things might have gone if I had been a bit more honest when we were at the academy.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, you probably wouldn't have gotten this back then, since we weren't at war and all. For all we know things could have gone better or gone way worse,” Shez said, before she let out a sigh, “But…I guess I would have appreciated being trusted like that.” </p><p> </p><p>“It’s hard to trust when everything you’ve been told and every sign you’ve seen points to the idea that you’ll be ruined or killed if your identity gets out. I had some pretty reasonable doubts that I would be treated kindly if people knew I was a half-Almyran prince sneaking his way into the country. Even if I did go in completely openly, I bet you there would’ve been an uproar just from people looking to tear down House Riegan.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s really cynical and pessimistic…and probably more realistic than them accepting you with open arms.”</p><p> </p><p>Claude chuckled. “Yeah, you get what I mean. Of course, being the surprise heir of House Riegan still put eyes on me, and with those eyes came plenty of expectations. It actually used to annoy me whenever people said I had privilege because I was a noble. What kind of privilege does a half-breed that everyone hates have? But, looking back on it, I can’t deny that I had a lot of advantages that put me up here.</p><p> </p><p>He smirked. “So now I know how to exploit those advantages for everything I can get.”</p><p> </p><p>“Like having all your rivals taken out in one go?”</p><p> </p><p><em> “Exactly. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Shez huffed in amusement, before deciding to bring up a concern she had. “Hey, so why did you put Kronya up as your ‘successor’ anyway? I know there’s no way you’ll be able to hold onto the whole ‘Duke of House Riegan’ position if you’re going to be king, but why her?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh that’s easy. Count Gloucester really wants to put his house as the new sovereigns of the Alliance and I just handed him an heir of House Riegan that needs his help to understand noble etiquette. Kronya, meanwhile, wants power, approval, and a cozy position, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh…well, that’s not exactly wrong,” Shez admitted, a bit glad to have his reasons confirmed, “I’m not sure if she’d say she wants a cozy position, but essentially owning the capital of the Alliance is probably going to make her happy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then my assumptions were still mostly right. I figured it was the easiest way to get a lot of allies on my side that are happy with me specifically. Of course, Gloucester could try to turn on me in the long run, but that’ll put him on the bad side of too many people for the risk to be worth it. Better he takes what’s right in front of him and starts planning for a more cooperative future.” He grinned over at her. “Hell, if he had the chance, I bet he would try marrying Kronya and Lorenz together to secure everything. Such a shame for him that you seduced her already.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Okay I know you're trying to get me flustered but you put the image of Kronya and Lorenz getting married in my head and now I have to hit my head against the nearest wall.” </p><p> </p><p>Claude paused, then smirked. “Thinking about it, isn’t he about a foot taller than her? They’d make for quite the pair, side by side. Long man Lorenz and his tiny, stabby wife.”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Shez turned her gaze to Claude. “Or I could hit my head against yours.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey now, my brain is more valuable than yours, you shouldn’t threaten it like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh, Byleth can handle things for us.” That got Claude to laugh, up until he realized Shez was actually walking towards him. </p><p> </p><p>“Uh, wait, you aren't serious, right?” he asked, backing away. </p><p> </p><p>“C’mon Claude, let me introduce you to the wonderful world of being a dumbass!” Shez offered with a malicious grin. Turning on his heel, Claude began to run as Shez chased after him, intent on hunting him down. </p><p> </p><p>Elsewhere, Byleth looked out towards the south, an aching in her chest as she let out a sigh. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey there Professor, are you doing okay?” Hilda asked, walking up to the green-haired woman, “Don't tell me Catherine actually scrambled something in there.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, she hits hard, but I was healed properly,” Byleth replied, even though her jaw still ached. “I still hit her harder.” </p><p> </p><p>“Ha. Remind me not to get on your bad side.” </p><p> </p><p>“Don't worry, you probably won't,” Byleth replied, before tilting her head, “Well, as long as you don't make Marianne cry, I suppose.” </p><p> </p><p>“I would never!” Hilda exclaimed, offended at the thought. </p><p> </p><p>“Then you have nothing to worry about,” </p><p> </p><p>“Hmph. You know, even if she was happy, I'm still annoyed that Marianne left the Deer to join the Eagles.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hm…Apologizing might be meaningless, but I am still sorry. If she had stayed with the Deer, then she'd probably be here with you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but she's probably safer with your students. I might not be that close to Edelgard, but even I know not many can take her in a fight.” Sighing, Hilda leaned against the rampart next to Byleth. “Gotta admit, a part of me’s been wanting to try and sneak into the Empire for years now.” </p><p> </p><p>“I can understand that. The main reason I haven't raced off is that I know it'd be bad to go by myself, and that I need to think logically.” </p><p> </p><p>“And I definitely don't want to deal with all the extra work. Claude would probably figure out if I tried to sneak off and he'd give me tons of work to do down south," Hilda said with a laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“He probably would. Though I think you'd be good at whatever work that'd be.” </p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, don't let anyone hear you. I already want to retire.” </p><p> </p><p>“It'd be nice to retire while young, though I don't think I'll be able to with how much I have to work on,” Byleth remarked, before pausing when she heard yelling. </p><p> </p><p>“Stop chasing me!” Claude shouted, running past them as a purple blur soon followed. </p><p> </p><p>“NEVER!” Shez yelled, leaving the two to stare in silence, before Byleth turned to Hilda. </p><p> </p><p>“See what I mean?” </p><hr /><p>Shez’s shenanigans aside, things progressed pretty smoothly once their plans were made. Claude, in an unsurprising but somewhat disappointing outcome, had to head back to Almyra with his remaining siblings to get things settled on that end. Holst would be going with him as Leicester’s official ambassador, a first for the Alliance. The fact that he had the backing of the archbishop to give the trip legitimacy probably helped.</p><p> </p><p>And so, after many tearful goodbyes, some more than others, they were on their way.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, I feel kind of bad for Farah,” Shez admitted, sitting with her sister on Byleth’s new wyvern, “She seemed like she really wanted to come along.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have my suspicions that her intentions were not entirely innocent,” Byleth responded, keeping her eyes forward, “Besides, if she truly wants to join my class, she can apply to join the Officer’s Academy next year.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh please, you were just as upset that you’re not getting a new ‘Eagle’,” Shez teased, earning a huff from her sister. “...so, after this, you’re gonna go back to teaching at the monastery?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth paused. “Hm. I guess I haven’t fully thought about my future plans. I know it’s an option. I just…”</p><p> </p><p>Shez watched her sister trail off, then made a show of shrugging as she let out a sigh. “Yeah, future plans are a pain. I have no idea what I’m doing. Aside from maybe being Kronya’s trophy wife?”</p><p> </p><p>“‘Trophy wife’?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I know I can kick ass and all but I have no idea how noble stuff works. So odds are I’m just gonna be standing around, looking hot to raise her prestige. I mean, if I do marry her anyway, because, well, I guess there’s still stuff with Lysithea and…hm. Um…anyway! Let’s figure that out later!”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth smiled at her sister’s antics. “Yes, let’s focus on retaking the monastery first. Everything after that…we’ll see.”</p><p> </p><p>With that, their journey to reclaim Garreg Mach continued, though Byleth’s thoughts did keep drifting. It didn’t help that it was a rather long journey, since they had to stop at Gloucester territory to resupply. They had planned to pick up Kronya too, but apparently she was busy with the Count. Something about fortifying the Bridge of Myrddin against a potential retaliation from Hyrm.</p><p> </p><p>That was slightly concerning, but Rhea was adamant about reclaiming the monastery before helping the Alliance further, so onward they went until they arrived to set up camp further down the mountain from the monastery and began scouting. To the army’s surprise though, the mountains were bizarrely clear of demonic beasts for the first time in years, which was concerning to an understandably on edge Byleth.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Byleth, are you doing okay?” Shez asked, marching next to her sister on the way up towards the monastery.</p><p> </p><p>“I think so. Everything just feels…tense,” Byleth admitted, unsure of what else to say. </p><p> </p><p>“Because of the battle, or because of something else?”</p><p> </p><p>“Something else.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm…more future thoughts?”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth considered the question, then shook her head. “No. It’s…something about being here, in this area, is making me feel tense.”</p><p> </p><p>Her answer made sense the moment she said it. Something about being near Garreg Mach…she’d enjoyed being at the monastery in the time she was there, but, equally, it was a place that put her family and newfound friends in danger, again and again. And her last memories here–fire, blood, being attacked by a monster that possessed her sister–they weren’t pleasant ones.</p><p> </p><p>When the gates of Garreg Mach grew closer in sight, she felt her chest clench as a flood of memories rushed through her head, including the phantom pain of Shez’s sword in her chest. </p><p> </p><p>“Byleth? You okay–” Feeling a hand on her shoulder, Byleth felt herself flinching as she pulled away from Shez. “Ah.”</p><p> </p><p>“S-Sorry. Sorry, I…” Byleth took a breath, then abruptly gave her sister a hug. Shez couldn't help but stiffen a bit, her arms awkwardly at her sides as Byleth hugged her tightly. After a moment, she hugged her back, feeling Byleth give her one more squeeze before breaking the hug. “I think I'm not comfortable here.” </p><p> </p><p>“Ah…do you want to stay back?” </p><p> </p><p>“No. I want to help here, and…even if I am afraid, I don't just want to run away.” </p><p> </p><p>Shez’s lips turned up into a grin. “Hell yeah, we’re gonna face those fears and then we’re gonna kick their asses!”</p><p> </p><p>In the face of her sister’s enthusiasm, Byleth couldn’t help but return that smile. “Yes, we will. Onward!”</p><p> </p><p>“Onward!” Shez echoed before they continued their journey up towards Garreg Mach, moving towards the front of the procession as they made their way to the front gates.</p><p> </p><p>There was still a sense of tension in the journey, though it came more from an awareness that they were moving into enemy territory than any previous anxieties. That and most of those who had been there before couldn't help but feel uneasy as they looked upon the destruction wrought upon the town. Luckily, or perhaps ominously, they still didn’t run into any threats on the way, even though there had supposedly been demonic beasts practically ruling the mountains for years. Once they reached the gate though, Byleth found herself pausing at the sight of black banners threaded with red flame patterns hanging from the wall.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't remember hearing anything about this,” she heard Catherine mutter, the knight already pulling out her sword. </p><p> </p><p>“They must have moved in recently,” Shamir noted, a hand moving to grab an arrow. </p><p> </p><p>“Regardless of when they moved here, their occupation shall not continue,” Rhea stated, marching forward, ahead of everyone else. She didn't get far before she caught an arrow that had been launched at her, crushing the shaft as she did. She openly snarled, glaring up at the archers on the wall as a surprisingly familiar individual stepped forward.</p><p> </p><p>“FOOLS! YOU ENTER THE TERRITORY OF THE FLAME EMPEROR!” declared someone who was definitely wearing the Flame Emperor’s armor, “LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS AND ARMOR, AND PERHAPS I SHALL SPARE YOUR PITIFUL LIVES!”</p><p> </p><p>“…” Byleth glanced at Shez. “Yeah, that’s not Edelgard.”</p><p> </p><p>“You still thought it was?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not really, but it’s good to confirm it.”</p><p> </p><p>“This bastard would dare call my home his territory,” Rhea growled, a murderous glint in her eyes, “I’ll rend him limb from–!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hang on,” Shez interrupted, a frown coming to her face as she looked up at the bandits on the wall, “I think I know that guy.”</p><p> </p><p>“The Flame Emperor?” Shamir asked, an eyebrow raised while Rhea glowered at being interrupted.</p><p> </p><p>“No, the other guy, next to him,” Shez explained, pointing up towards a scruffy man with a bowl cut, “Hey, aren’t you Pallardo!?”</p><p> </p><p>The man called Pallardo immediately stiffened while the ‘Flame Emperor’ felt a cold sweat start to go down his back. “Ah…yes, I’m Pallardo! Why are you asking?”</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t I kill you??”</p><p> </p><p>“…no?” </p><p> </p><p>“Why was that a question??”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…well, I’m alive, so–wait, hold on…” His eyes narrowed in suspicion, before he abruptly recognized the orange-and-purple-haired young woman. “You’re the girl that killed Pallardo!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I just said–Hang on, who are you then? His twin brother?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, no, we’re not related, I’m just his body double.” He paused, his brain catching up with his words. “Also, uh, I’m Pallardo. Forget what I just said.”</p><p> </p><p>“Does it even matter who he is?” Catherine asked, bewildered by the exchange while Shez’s eyes narrowed in suspicion at the increasingly sweaty Flame Emperor.</p><p> </p><p>“It might. Hey, Metodey! How’s the arm?”</p><p> </p><p>The so-called Flame Emperor, who had been staring straight at the Eisner sisters while unconsciously clutching his previously dislocated arm, stiffened…then promptly bolted in the opposite direction, sprinting away from those devil sisters as quickly as he could.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone couldn't help but stare in confusion, before a blast of dark magic hit the stunned enemies, sending bandits flying. </p><p> </p><p>“Don't let him get away!” Lysithea shouted, getting everyone to move, rushing the bandits who scrambled to defend themselves. </p><p> </p><p>Drawing his bow, a bandit archer aimed at Shez, ready to fire before suddenly feeling his face crumbling under the force of Rhea’s fist as the archbishop raged against those who attempted to take her home. </p><p> </p><p>“Shit!” ‘Pallardo’ shouted, before turning around to run after the ‘Flame Emperor’. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth and Shez glanced at one another, before nodding as they immediately took off, chasing down the two who ran. Byleth had to admit, it was almost impressive how quickly the bandit was able to run wearing all that armor. </p><p> </p><p>“Gotta say, I’m almost impressed that dick is still alive,” Shez remarked, feeling a lot more casual now that she knew the Flame Emperor was just an asshole instead of someone important, “Kinda surprised he was scary enough to be one of the big three threats the Alliance was worried about though.”</p><p> </p><p>“Anyone can be dangerous under the right circumstances,” Byleth reminded.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sure, but it felt like the big bad Flame Emperor would be somebody more important, you know? Like…oh, like my evil twin!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth frowned. “Didn’t you suggest that before? Back when Bias abducted you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Did I? Uh…oh yeah, I thought he might be my evil brother! And I’m absolutely not wrong that it would’ve been cool if he was!”</p><p> </p><p>“It would have been awkward. I don't think Fodlan could handle two of you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Ha! We could probably win the war on our own.” Shez laughed, turning the corner as they continued their chase, entering the Monastery proper as the pair of bandits kept fleeing further.</p><p> </p><p>“Partner, where are you?” Though she did stumble for a moment as Arval suddenly appeared next to her. </p><p> </p><p>“Woah, give a warning next time will you?” </p><p> </p><p>“I'm giving a warning now! Something feels wrong here,” Arval warned as the sisters burst into the dining hall, right in time to see ‘Pallardo’ and the ‘Flame Emperor’ practically collapse at the feet of a cloaked man. An Agarthan, based on the black clothes and bird mask. </p><p> </p><p>“B-Boss! Please, help me! Those devil sisters are here!” Metodey frantically begged.</p><p> </p><p>“This was supposed to be an easy job!” ‘Pallardo’ complained, “Weren’t we just supposed to be your doubles!? I was told nothing about having to deal with Pallardo's killer!” </p><p> </p><p>“...Yeah, this looks completely dangerous, buddy,” Shez muttered, glancing at the Agarthan, who seemed busy reading a journal of some kind. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Seriously, we haven't even been here for a week and you already let someone break through? Jeez, I know you're hired help, but I thought you'd at least be more useful than this,” the masculine-sounding Agarthan complained, his voice audibly annoyed. </p><p> </p><p>“That's on you for hiring those two of all people,” Shez remarked, forming her sword and leveling at him as the pair of bandits scrambled to hide behind their apparent leader.</p><p> </p><p>“I would suggest cutting him down now,” Arval suggested, their hackles clearly raised.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Now now, no need to be all violent, I was actually hoping to get to talk to you. After all it's not everyday you meet the legendary Ashen Dragon and Violet Demon,” the Agarthan remarked, before raising the journal, getting Byleth to stiffen, “Thanks for leaving your journal behind, by the way! It was fun reading about–” </p><p> </p><p>Feeling the flow of time come to a halt at her command, Byleth rushed forward, her hand outstretched to grab her journal–</p><p> </p><p>Feeling her hand grab air, she had a moment to blink, before a foot was driven into her side. Grunting as she was tossed back, time started again while the Agarthan let out an amused whistle. </p><p> </p><p>“Woah, I was told about the time reversal, but not that.” Standing up, the Agarthan set the journal down. “Gotta say, that was more exciting than I thought it'd be.” </p><p> </p><p>“...Who are you?” Byleth questioned, leveling her sword at him, as Shez gave her sister a concerned glance. Nobody should’ve been able to counter Byleth when she was using her time powers.</p><p> </p><p>“Me? Well, I don't have a proper name, but you could call me by my project title: The New Liberator,” he said, before pulling down his hood and taking off his mask, making the sisters stiffen. </p><p> </p><p>A familiar smile greeted the two, along with a shock of messy purple hair covering one eye. The young man beneath the hood regarded the pair with casual amusement, before turning his visible eye towards Shez, its iris a divine shade of pale green. </p><p> </p><p>“Though, you could always call me Shez, sister.” </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Byleth and Shez could only stare in shocked silence at the man standing before them, claiming to be Shez’s brother. The man in question smiled back at them, before his face slowly turned red. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait, no, don't call me that, that's embarrassing,” he said, cutting through the tension as he covered his face, looking away from the two. “Ah, give me a second, please, I need to come up with something better…”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth stared at the embarrassed Agarthan for a moment, then looked at her sister with open bafflement. “You really do have an evil twin…”</p><p> </p><p>“...why’d you say that after he made himself look like a complete dork?” Shez questioned, staring at Byleth, who casually averted her eyes. “Don’t look away.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth ignored her though, focusing on Evil-Shez. “Who are you, really?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” He turned back to her, his eyebrow raised. “I just said who I am. I mean, obviously I can’t also go by Shez, that would just get confusing, but I didn’t really think of my own name before now. Papa Myson usually just called me subject…uh…subject…I know it was a number, but maybe it was a name? Like…Sigma? Though that feels kinda lame for a name, right?</p><p> </p><p>He held his chin with his hand, thinking. “...maybe Shax? What do you think about Shax?”</p><p> </p><p>“So you’re just a knock-off me then,” Shez commented, frowning, “I guess that works then.”</p><p> </p><p>“...well now I don’t want to call myself that, jerk.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth stared. “Two of them…”</p><p> </p><p>“Can you two please stop joking and deal with him!” Arval shouted. </p><p> </p><p>“Aw, come on Arval, as a fellow Agarthan shouldn't you be on my side?” Shax complained, making the spirit stiffen.</p><p> </p><p>“You can hear me?!”</p><p> </p><p>“He can hear you??” Shez echoed.</p><p> </p><p>“Am I the only one who can’t hear Arval?” Byleth asked, feeling oddly left out.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, no need to be sad, little sister,” Shax mockingly consoled, “You’re not missing anything worthwhile.”</p><p> </p><p>“…when were you born?”</p><p> </p><p>“Physically? I suppose my creation process only really started three years ago, but I did have an accelerated growth cycle.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, what? So you’re like a baby?!” Shez exclaimed, earning an abrupt laugh from Shax.</p><p> </p><p>“Ha! Nah, nope, no I am most definitely not. Full maturity here, sis, just on an accelerated timetable. And besides, if we factor in the other half of my creation, then I’ve got a good thousand years on both of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“…uh…what? You’re an old man?”</p><p> </p><p>“All little kids think they’re more mature than they are,” Byleth remarked, earning a side-eye from Shez.</p><p> </p><p>“That felt pointed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not towards you.”</p><p> </p><p>Shax chuckled. “Ah, so this is what having siblings is like. Fun, but also kind of annoying…but going back to your stupid question, while I might’ve been made not that long ago, the half of me that shares blood with Byleth there was born, lived, and died before this shitty church was even a thing.” </p><p> </p><p>“...Do you mean Nemesis?” </p><p> </p><p>“That I do! It seems mixing the blood is why I look like this, rather than a full clone of Shez here.” With a grin, he opened his cloak, before pulling out a sword he had at his side. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth felt her breath stop when she saw the black blade he pulled free, its familiar design sending a shudder through her body. The sword in his hands was not the Sword of the Creator, she knew that much, but it still made her take a step back. </p><p> </p><p>The “bone” it was made of was too dark, nearly fully black, and while the general shape was the same, the two crest stones set in the center of the false sword bore the crests of Timotheos and Noa. It felt…wrong. Disturbingly wrong.</p><p> </p><p>“It's also why I can use this! Shame you seem to be missing yours,” Shax remarked, before swinging his sword, the blade extending just like the original to reach the sisters. Bringing their own swords up, the pair blocked the whip-like attack. Or at least tried to.</p><p> </p><p>Moving back, Byleth felt a frown on her face at the sight of her sword split in half. “Should have gotten a silver sword.” </p><p> </p><p>“Here!” Shez called out, tossing Byleth her red sword before warping behind Shax, who ducked her swing and kicked Shez in the abdomen, sending her flying back.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice trick! Let’s see if I can copy it!” the clone taunted, before flashing over to Byleth and bringing down the dark sword in a heavy overhand swing, nearly sending Byleth to her knees when she blocked it.</p><p> </p><p>Placing her palm against the flat side of her sword, Byleth pushed to the side, getting Shax off of her. Shifting the blade, Byleth stabbed at his side, hitting air when he flashed away.</p><p> </p><p>“Ha! Good luck hitting–” Letting out a yelp as he ducked, Shax lost a few hairs off the top of his head after Byleth flung her sword at him. Appearing behind him, Shez caught the tossed blade, before bringing both her swords down on him. Falling to his knee as he blocked the strike, Shax smirked up at her. </p><p> </p><p>“Had a feeling this wouldn't be easy. Oh well!” Shax abruptly grabbed Shez’s wrist, giving her only a moment to blink as Dark Spikes formed around them, about to crash down–</p><p> </p><p>Shax paused as he found himself suddenly returned to his previous position, right before he felt an abrupt heat at his side. He braced himself, but the fireball’s explosion still sent him flying across the room before he managed to arrest his flight by stabbing his sword into the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Immediately, his eyes went to Byleth as a smirk crept up his face. “Wow, Miss Bias was right, that time reversal isn't fair at all! Couldn't you have waited a few more seconds, huh?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not taking requests from you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, if you're going to be rude.” Standing up, an orange glow surrounded him as familiar markings appeared on his face. “Guess I don't need to hold back.” </p><p> </p><p>“Seriously, do you not have anything original??” Shez complained, glowering at her copy.</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, you’re hurting my feelings here, sister! I can’t help it if I’m similar to my twin!” He grinned, his eyes flicking between the two of them before he paused and tilted his head. “Ah…hm, I might need to cut this short. As fun as it would be to try testing myself with the rest of your forces, I can’t say I’m willing to fight a battle I know I’m going to lose. And I can’t see myself taking out that alabaster abomination if I’m having trouble with you two.”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean Rhea?” Byleth questioned, keeping an eye on the Agarthan and taking some mental notes of his appearance. His ‘awakened form’ looked similar to Shez’s, but there were slight differences in the markings and his eyes were more red than orange.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the bitch!” Shax agreed, still grinning, “She feels like somebody I’ll have to work my way up to, not the first beast on kill list. Though, if I get the chance…ah, I’ll figure that out later. For now though…” </p><p> </p><p>Looking around, Shax spotted the two cowering bandits hiding behind the kitchen counter. With a flash, he appeared next to the two with a bright smile. </p><p> </p><p>“T-Time to go, Boss?” ‘Pallardo’ asked, looking hopefully up at his employer. </p><p> </p><p>“That it is.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh thank the goddess, finally my luck turns around! Now let's get–” Whatever the ‘Flame Emperor’ was about to say was cut off as Shax grabbed the pair by their faces, the Flame Emperor's mask cracking from the force of his grip. His smile remained fixed in place as a surge of magic went through his arms and burst his sleeves apart, pure darkness flowing through his body and pushing right into his unfortunate victims.</p><p> </p><p>“Make sure to buy me some time,” Shax requested as the two began to let out muffled screams. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth and Shez watched on in horror as they heard bones begin to shift and snap, a black mass covering the two bandits before they began to grow, their clothes tearing under the stress of their sudden growth. A crash was heard as the two demonic beasts destroyed the kitchen they were once standing in, before the pair of monstrosities roared, their enormous maws opening to show sharpened teeth. </p><p> </p><p>“...What did you just do?” Byleth wondered, staring at the forced transformation with a sense of creeping dread.</p><p> </p><p>“How the hell…?” Shez murmured, torn between staring at the monsters and her distorted double.</p><p> </p><p>“Just a bit of insurance we gave them beforehand. Consider it a severance package for their lackluster performance,” Shax explained, before giving them a quick two finger salute, the veins of his arms pulsing black, “See you two later!” </p><p> </p><p>With that, he vanished in a burst of darkness, leaving the sisters to deal with the pair of black and crimson demonic beasts that were tearing their way out of the dining hall’s ruins.</p><p> </p><p>“...Guess we're not having a victory feast,” Byleth muttered, before casting an Aura on one of the demonic beasts, the holy rings trapping it as it screamed in pain. </p><p> </p><p>Not saying anything, Shez rushed out, chasing after the other demonic beast to cut it down before it could get away. She really hoped they wouldn't get blamed for all the destruction it was causing as it scrambled away, crashing into the fishing hut next to the pond. At least most of the monastery had already been destroyed before they showed up.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, enough of that,” Shez huffed, flashing above it, and using her awakened form to give her a boost to cut through its neck. Grunting as her sword got jammed, she put her weight behind it, pushing through its neck as it screamed. “Egh…” </p><p> </p><p>“Shez?! Where did the demonic beast come from?!” came a sudden exclamation that drew Shez’s attention towards Lysithea’s rapid approach, along with a number of knights following her.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, long story, real quick, mind helping?” Shez requested. She might’ve gotten better at killing monsters over the course of her years alone, but demonic beasts were pretty durable and even this new creature was–And then she actually pierced through something important and the whole thing abruptly dropped, crashing to the ground as its tongue lolled out of its mouth. “Oh. Huh, guess they aren’t as durable…”</p><p> </p><p>She hopped down from the slain beast, then took a second to make sure Byleth was handling her own monster well enough. Her magic seemed to be holding it in place well enough, and soon Catherine and Shamir joined in to slice it up and fill it full of arrows, respectively.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, now that that’s handled, uh…” Shez glanced back at Lysithea, trying to think of how to phrase things, “I guess, um…to make a long story short, I have an evil twin.” </p><p> </p><p>Lysithea blinked. She glanced over at the ruined dining hall, where Byleth was explaining what happened to an irate Catherine, then frowned at Shez. “Shez, I realize you have a rivalry with Byleth, but calling her evil is uncalled for.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No, not her! Obviously not Byleth, we’re not even twins–Oh, wait, I guess I did say that for a while…well, anyway, she wouldn’t be the evil one even if we were, obviously that would be me.”</p><p> </p><p>That earned a small frown. “Shez–”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Anyway </em>, that's not important right now! I have an actual evil twin! Who’s a guy for some reason!” </p><p> </p><p>“...What?” </p><p> </p><p>“I have an evil twin who’s a guy for some reason,” Shez repeated, “I’m not sure how else to explain it. Well, I guess there is the thing where he’s apparently related to Byleth too because his blood was mixed with Nemesis’s, which I really don’t understand how that could’ve happened considering–”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea held up a hand. “Shez, slow down. You’re starting to ramble. Why don’t you take a moment to collect your thoughts, and then we can report what happened to Lady Rhea and–“</p><p> </p><p>“WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DINING HALL?!” the Archbishop in question shrieked, looking understandably upset with the complete destruction of a part of the monastery. Granted, most of the monastery was fairly ruined from the attack three years prior, but at least most of the buildings were actually intact. Or, well, they had been.</p><p> </p><p>“…or she’ll just wander over on her own,” Lysithea mumbled, a little put out..</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, Byleth decided she should be the one to answer Rhea’s enraged question. “Shez has an evil twin who is male for some reason and he turned the fake Flame Emperor and his second-in-command into demonic beasts.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea paused, her anger turning to confusion as she turned to Byleth, then looked at Shez, before looking back at Byleth in obvious bafflement. “What.”</p><p> </p><p>The sisters glanced at each other. “Do you want to explain or should I?”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh, I got this,” Shez assured her sister, before turning to Rhea, “Okay, so, it turns out the Flame Emperor here was actually this guy who I thought I killed called Metodey–“</p><hr /><p>Byleth felt a small frown come to her face as she gazed upon the ruins of her bedroom. She’d always thought her bedroom at the monastery would be temporary, considering her plans to leave Garreg Mach at the end of the year, but it still felt bad seeing it smashed apart and crumbling. Bias’s meteor shower really had destroyed a lot of the monastery, and years of neglect hadn’t helped things.</p><p> </p><p>She let out a small sigh, before heading towards Shez’s room. Luckily for her sister, Shez’s bedroom had managed to avoid the rocks and flames that ruined most of the other dorms. In fact, it was probably the most intact place Byleth had seen so far.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, I completely forgot I borrowed this book from the library,” Shez said as she skimmed through the book in her hands, glancing over at Byleth as she entered, “Hey By, do you think that Bias bitch will try to go after me for having an overdue book? She was the librarian and all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, probably,” Byleth replied, shrugging, “I have to imagine it’s the whole reason she hates us to begin with.”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea rolled her eyes, giving Byleth an unimpressed look from where she was sitting on the bed. “Could you two please not joke about the mad sorceress with a vendetta against you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, sure. We can talk about how Shez decided to bring you to her bedroom instead.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wh–I was just–I-I’m helping her search her room!”</p><p> </p><p>Shez snorted, grinning. “Yeah you’re being really helpful Lys. Doing the proper noble thing of supervising while I do the work, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Lysithea’s face reddened, before she pushed herself up. “You were the one who said I could sit!”</p><p> </p><p>“Pff–I know, I know, I’m just teasing! Heh, sorry about that,” Shez said, stifling her laughter, before she paused, “Wait, I need to check something.” </p><p> </p><p>Getting on her knees, Shez reached under her bed, searching for something. </p><p> </p><p>“What exactly are you doing?” Lysithea asked</p><p> </p><p>“Searching for my box,” Shez replied, tossing bits of rubble and clothing out from under the bed, before she smiled, “Aha!” </p><p> </p><p>Pulling her arm out, Shez held a box that seemed pretty dusty, but otherwise undamaged. Wiping the dust off as she stood up, Shez placed the box on her bed. </p><p> </p><p>“...Why exactly were you hiding this under your bed?”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh, no reason. Just felt like putting the junk there.” With that, Shez opened the box, displaying several random objects that were stuffed inside. </p><p> </p><p>Byleth peered at the box’s content curiously, wondering when her sister had turned into such a hoarder, before she paused when Lysithea made a surprised noise. </p><p> </p><p>“W-Where did you get that doll?!” the former noble squeaked, surprised and embarrassed to see a very familiar princess doll amidst Shez’s bizarre collection.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Oh, I found it. Uh…I think it was in the reception hall or something?” Shez shrugged. “Why, you like it?”</p><p> </p><p>“That–No–Well, yes, I do–Th-That’s not the issue here! The issue is that it’s <em> my </em> doll!”</p><p> </p><p>“You own dolls?” Shez asked, getting Lysithea to blush. </p><p> </p><p>“Shut up!” </p><p> </p><p>“It's a nice looking doll,” Byleth said, trying to help. </p><p> </p><p>“Th-That's not the issue here!” Lysithea responded, looking back at the box, before grabbing a small book about sweets. “Wait, this is mine as well!” </p><p> </p><p>“...” Byleth peered into the box as well, “...Shez, why do you have things belonging to my students as well? Actually, I think there are things belonging to everyone from the academy here. Students and faculty.” </p><p> </p><p>“Really? Huh.” Shez shrugged. “Well they’re mine now.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Shez, how did you get these?”</p><p> </p><p>“Found them,” Shez answered, before thinking about it, “I think it started with a hairclip I found. It looked nice, and I didn't know who it belonged to, so I kept it. Afterwards, I just started keeping whatever I found.” </p><p> </p><p>“And you kept them in a box under your bed instead of looking for their owners.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well yeah. Finders keepers.”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth gave her sister a blank stare. “Shez, we’re returning these.”</p><p> </p><p>“Aw, what? Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Aside from the fact that these don’t belong to you, you’re not even using them for anything. You’re just collecting things for no reason.”</p><p> </p><p>“That's not true, I use some of the stuff!” Reaching into the box, she pulled out a foldable razor, “Like this!” </p><p> </p><p>“That's Hubert’s.” Only to immediately drop it when Byleth guessed who it belonged to. </p><p> </p><p>“...I'm not cursed because I used that, right?” </p><p> </p><p>“You probably are.” </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t tell her that,” Lysithea chided.</p><p> </p><p>“She has to learn,” Byleth replied, before starting to look through the box’s contents again, “Hm…well, at least you kept everything in one convenient place. It will make it easier to return everything to their real owners.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Can I keep anything that doesn't belong to anyone or they don't want?” Shez asked as Byleth began to move things around in the box, trying to make it neat. </p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Byleth responded, “It's a good thing most of the Golden Deer are here, it'll make it quick to return some of these things.” </p><p> </p><p>Shez couldn't help but pout as Byleth picked the box up, and walked out of the room, handing something to Lysithea as she did. “Oh, is that perfume yours?” </p><p> </p><p>“A-And what if it is, is that a problem?” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh no, of course not. I used it a bit myself and liked it, so you have good taste.” </p><p> </p><p>“H-Hmph, of course I do!” Lysithea retorted as she turned away from Shez, her cheeks turning pink as she tried to subtly spray herself with the perfume. </p><p> </p><p>And so the Eisner sisters, plus Lysithea, began returning every lost item Shez had collected to their owners. A task that earned some grumbling from Shez, but also one that Byleth seemed to take to with a surprising degree of enthusiasm.</p><p> </p><p>Though maybe not that surprising, now that Shez really thought about it. Byleth was always pretty task-oriented and liked making people happy, so a simple job like giving Raphael his sack of rocks back would be the kind of thing she liked.</p><p> </p><p>“Why would you even bother keeping a burlap sack filled with rocks?” Lysithea questioned, raising an eyebrow at Shez while the mercenary watched her sister give away her stuff.</p><p> </p><p>“Eh…I probably had a reason when I found it,” Shez replied, tilting her head in thought, “…maybe I thought it was for decoration?”</p><p> </p><p>“…you think a burlap sack filled with rocks is a decoration?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, I don’t know what nobles are into. Or most commoners, apparently, since it was Raphael’s.” Shez paused. “Oh, maybe I thought it would be good ammo? Maybe for throwing at people?”</p><p> </p><p>“It would be better to buy a sling to use for the rocks than throw the rocks by hand,” Byleth pointed out as she returned to them, “Also you’ve never trained with a sling before, so you would probably–Hm. Wyvern.”</p><p> </p><p>Shez blinked, then followed her sister’s gaze up towards the sky where there was indeed a wyvern flying in. “...is that one of ours?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think…no, hold on. It has yellow on its reins and saddle.”</p><p> </p><p>“An Alliance wyvern?” Lysithea wondered, furrowing her brows in thought as the wyvern approached…before she let out an annoyed sigh when she spotted the shock of orange hair the woman on the wyvern’s back had. “Of course it’s Kronya…”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh? It is?” It took Shez a second to make the same connection, but the instant she did she smiled brightly and started heading right over, “Hey, Kronya! Ha, so now you show up! You completely missed the battle!”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, Shez, my beloved! I have arrived for thee!” Kronya responded in a remarkably similar sounding tone of voice to a certain purple-haired noble. The Agarthan also happened to look a lot more “noble” than she did before, now wearing black and gold armor that looked similar to Claude’s, if modified to fit her better, and apparently having actually combed her hair for once in her life. </p><p> </p><p>She hopped off the wyvern without any issue and strode over to Shez with a bright grin. “So hey, how was that? Did I sound like one of those fancy nobles or what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, I guess? I don’t think nobles say ‘thee’ though,” Shez replied, glancing at Lysithea for confirmation.</p><p> </p><p>“No, we don’t use ‘thee’ in common conversation,” Lysithea explained with a sigh, “That’s an archaic vernacular.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Agarthan, I’m better at ‘archaic vernacula’ than you’ll ever be,” Kronya retorted, before turning her attention back to Shez, “Also, it’s not my fault I missed the battle, I needed to get my fancy outfit ready! Apparently that’s a very important part of being a noble!”</p><p> </p><p>“It really isn't,” Lysithea grumbled. </p><p> </p><p>“Well how would you know?” </p><p> </p><p>“Because I was a noble as well!” </p><p> </p><p>“Former noble.<em> I'm </em> the noble now,” Kronya pointed, smirking at Lysithea. </p><p> </p><p>“...” Lysithea’s eye began to twitch as magic began to condense in her hand. </p><p> </p><p>“Woah, woah! Come on now, no need to fight!” Shez said, getting in between the two. “Come on Kronya, we have to fill you in on what you missed.” </p><p> </p><p>“Is it really that important?” </p><p> </p><p>“Shez has an evil twin,” Byleth said. “Specifically a brother.”</p><p> </p><p>“...Huh…is he hot?” </p><p> </p><p>“Why is that your first question?!” Lysithea asked, practically shouting. </p><p> </p><p>“Because it's important, duh,” Kronya responded, making Lysithea’s eye twitch again. </p><p> </p><p>Deciding it would be best not to get caught in the crossfire, Byleth walked away, looking for a place to store the box since she had finished returning everything to the Deer scattered around the monastery. She could always put it in her room, but a part of her felt like Shez might wind up “collecting” it again if she didn’t do something to hide–</p><p> </p><p>Then she paused when the sound of movement caught her attention. It was distant, but her now pointed ears were slightly more sensitive than they had been before, and she already had good hearing back then, so the sound of footsteps against stone immediately drew her attention towards a large pile of rubble along one wall.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she inclined her head, focusing on the sound. From the noise…there were likely two people, one with heavier steps than the other. Neither were making an effort to disguise their footsteps, so it was possible they weren’t dangerous…but it was equally possible that they just didn’t know they should be quiet.</p><p> </p><p>“...don’t know why you want to head up here now,” one of the voices muttered as they reached the entrance the rubble was covering, “I thought you said there were too many bandits up here to deal with?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, there <em> were </em>,” the other voice countered. Something about his amused tone sounded strangely familiar… “Remember that friend of mine I had planted near the oh so threatening ‘Flame Emperor’?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, the one you insist isn’t actually the real Flame Emperor. What point are you trying to make?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well he scrambled back down here, saying they’d just been cleared out by an unexpected army coming up the mountain. One that I think we should introduce ourselves too.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hold on, who exactly–” Before the strangely familiar voice could finish his sentence, a hand pushed one rock out of the pile of rubble, causing the rest of the rocks to collapse down and fully expose the entrance.</p><p> </p><p>Byleth tensed, her hand beginning to gather magic before her eyes went wide in genuine surprise. “Dimitri? Yuri?”</p><p> </p><p>The prince of Faerghus gaped, staring back at the professor with equally wide eyes. “...Professor Byleth?! You’re alive??”</p><p> </p><p>“Seems so,” Yuri remarked, openly amused as the pair stared at one another, “Hello again, friend. Long time, no see.”</p><p> </p><p>“...oh.” Byleth reached into the box she held and picked out a training logbook, before holding it out to Dimitri. “I think this is yours.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah…thank you, professor.” Dimitri took the logbook. “...professor, why do you have this?”</p><p> </p><p>“Shez found it years ago and never gave it back.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. I see. Is…there a reason why she did that?”</p><p> </p><p>“She just keeps things that she finds, apparently. I also found these leather gloves that I think might be yours, and Yuri, I believe this makeup brush and these weighted dice are yours.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would she keep my gloves…” Dimitri murmured while Yuri let out an amused huff.</p><p> </p><p>“Is there a reason why you think these are mine, professor?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. They’re obviously yours,” Byleth bluntly replied.</p><p> </p><p>“...well, I guess I can’t argue with that. But more importantly, Dimitri, don’t you think you should talk to the professor about our needs?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm? Oh! Right, yes, professor! We of the Kingdom need your help–”</p><p> </p><p>Byleth held up a hand, forestalling Dimitri’s request. “I’m going to the Empire next. I can help the Kingdom afterwards.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh…excuse me?” </p><p> </p><p>“As it stands, taking back the Empire is the next logical step for our forces. Aside from being plentiful in resources to help supply the army, the Empire has a larger standing military force that will be able to better aid us in taking back the Kingdom. Not to mention that, since we have taken back Myrddyn Bridge and Garreg Mach, we're in a tactical position to close in on the former Duke Aegir’s position,” Byleth said, being straight and concise in her explanation that she had practiced. </p><p> </p><p>“I…see,” Dimitri replied, frowning for a moment when he thought of something, “...Professor, does this have anything to do with Edelgard in specific?” </p><p> </p><p>“...Obviously, I can still lend your forces anyone willing to help you out,” Byleth continued, fully ignoring that question, “Maybe some of the Alliance soldiers would be willing to help? The Church might help too, but I don’t know what Rhea’s current plans are.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then maybe we should ask her first?” Yuri suggested, “And we could also explain what we actually need help with so we don’t get told ‘no’ immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>“...right. It would be good to know what you actually need help with.” She nodded to that, before turning around and heading off, the chest of lost items still in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“...” Dimitri glanced at Yuri. “Do you know where she’s going?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why in the world would I know that?”</p><p> </p><p>“...should we follow her?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re the king, remember?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know I’m not officially crowned yet.”</p><p> </p><p>“We could get Rhea to do that.”</p><p> </p><p>“...We should follow her.”</p><p> </p><p>And so they did.</p>

  <span>“So, hang on, the Lions have been living under Garreg Mach in the Abyss this whole time?” Shez questioned, staring in some understandable confusion as Dimitri and Yuri talked with Rhea and Catherine, the two sides bringing each other up to speed on everything that happened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Apparently? I don’t know why you’re asking me like you think I’ll have an answer,” Lysithea replied, just as baffled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. You’d think they’d be busy trying to kill Dimitri’s evil uncle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They can always plot to commit murder and seize vengeance while living underground,” Kronya pointed out, “It’s a proud tradition in Agartha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think a tradition like that could be called ‘proud’,” Lysithea remarked while Shez tilted her head in thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh…I think I might need to check mom’s notes again. Faerghus has a couple Shambhalas in it, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As far as I know, there’s only one Shambhala,” Kronya replied, “If you mean that there are other Agarthan outposts in Faerghus, then yes, there should be.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good to know,” Shez murmured, waiting for a good point in the current conversation to butt in. And once she was pretty sure she spotted one, she promptly interrupted. “So hey, Dimitri, long time, no see! Quick question before we start catching up on what we’ve been up to, were you or the other Lions wandering around Faerghus for some reason a year or so back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seriously?” Catherine asked, giving Shez an annoyed look, “He was just talking about–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s fine, Catherine, I don’t mind explaining,” Dimitri said before he turned to Shez with a weary smile, “We haven’t been ‘wandering’, exactly, though we have been trying our best to resist my uncle’s tyranny. While Abyss has become something of a headquarters for our resistance, we have been trying our best to save people from those so-called Tempest Knights whenever we are able. As it is, making the Abyss our base had some unseen advantages as the series of tunnels beneath the monastery stretched out far beyond what we expected.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“While we can't say for sure how far or how many there are, we've found several that seem to open out in different territories in the Kingdom, as well as some into Alliance and Imperial territory. Though we try to use them sparingly so they don't get discovered,” Yuri added in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I recall there being information about such tunnels in the church’s archives,” Rhea spoke up, looking thoughtful, “If necessary, I believe there is even one leading directly to the Imperial capital, though unfortunately there isn’t one that leads to Fhirdiad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that makes sense. The first emperor was your boyfriend, right Rhea?” Shez asked, not noticing the alarmed look she received, “Meanwhile that Blaiddyd guy was just a random noble before Loog turned traitor and crowned himself king, so it’s not like you’d put a tunnel to his house.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t say Loog ‘turned traitor’,” Dimitri argued, frowning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...that’s the part you paid attention to, huh?” Yuri remarked, getting the prince to pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I never know what information you’ll suddenly be aware of,” Lysithea commented, giving Shez an exasperated look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I retain plenty of the things I learn,” Shez countered, “I just don’t have a use for them most of the time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rhea likes men?” Kronya, meanwhile, clearly had focused on the most important part of that conversation. “I thought she and the blonde there had a thing going on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She can like both,” Shez assured, “Also, Catherine wishes they did.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you shut up?!” Catherine demanded, glaring at Shez, who stuck her tongue out at her, “Gh–Oh that’s real mature!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“More mature than you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re really not,” Lysithea muttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can we please return to the subject at hand?” Rhea requested, feeling a headache coming along, “Dimitri, where exactly is the rest of your class?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They should be arriving soon enough, I just came ahead with Yuri to get an idea of what was occurring up here,” Dimitri said, before pausing, “Ah, Shez…you might want to inform the professor that she should avoid Mercedes.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What, did she fall in love with her too?” Shez asked, an eyebrow raised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...not exactly? It’s more…she believes your sister is a vessel of the goddess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…what’s the problem with that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...She believes your sister is a vessel of the goddess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I got that part. I don’t get why that’s a bad thing since she's completely right about that. I mean, Byleth isn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>just</span>
  </em>
  <span> a vessel, like how I’m not just a vessel for Epi, but that doesn’t really change the fact that Rhea made her one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sound of Rhea’s hands meeting her own face echoed loudly in the ensuing silence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a second, Shez seemed to realize something. “Oh, wait, do you guys not know that part? Man, it’s getting tricky trying to keep track of who knows what…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, please just assume no one knows the </span>
  <em>
    <span>very secret things</span>
  </em>
  <span> you continue to mention without thinking,” Rhea requested through gritted teeth, her voice muffled by her hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But a lot of people do know though? Lysithea, none of this is new info for you, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Shez, all of that information is new to me,” Lysithea replied, staring at Shez in complete confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, really? I could’ve sworn…” Shez frowned to herself, thinking back to her previous conversations with the former noble. “...huh. Hm. Yeah I might’ve just screwed up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I already knew all of that,” Kronya lied, her arms crossed over her chest as she regarded her lessers with a superior smirk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ignore her,” Shez requested, “Actually, ignore everything I said for the past minute. Just forget I said anything.” She glanced around, trying to think of a distraction, especially since Rhea was still glaring at her. “So, hey, where’d Byleth go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Down to Abyss,” Yuri answered, partially distracted by the implications of the new information he’d just received, “She wanted to check on the other Lions when they arrived.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. And Mercedes is with the Lions, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Forgive me, Lady Rhea but I think we may need to take a small break,” Dimitri said, quickly moving to leave the office. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, wait, Dimitri! Come back here! Don’t just run off!” Catherine shouted, following after the prince. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It can't be that bad, right?” Shez asked, deciding to follow along, “I mean, Byleth can probably handle it.” </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Byleth had often heard rather gruff mercenaries and the occasional crude knight say something along the lines of wanting a woman on their knees in front of them. She had wondered what they meant and why they seemed to be positively inclined to the idea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She honestly had no idea how it was supposed to be pleasant at all because seeing Mercedes drop down to her knees and begin praying towards her actually made her feel very uncomfortable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” She looked over at Annette, who had let out a small, exasperated sigh at the sight of her friend abruptly kneeling. “Is this…normal?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No–Well…yes? Now it is, I guess, but it’s been a while since she just stopped to pray out of nowhere–” She paused, abruptly registering Byleth’s presence. “Oh. Um. Huh. Hi, professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, yeah, hi. Again. Uh.” Annette stared at Byleth, her usually quick mind working much slower than usual as she stared at the green-haired professor, who used to have blue hair, and who had been missing for years now– “PROFESSOR BYLETH!? Wha–How–Why–N-No, no how! How are you here!??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Goddess Incarnate is capable of many miracles, Annie,” Mercedes stated, not moving from her praying position.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah, what’s with all the shouting–” Sylvain asked as he walked over, the small frown on his face dropping along with his jaw once he caught sight of Byleth. “Holy…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, very holy,” Mercedes agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sylvain? Did something hap–...” Ingrid arrived about a second later and went about as still as her childhood friend, her eyes wide as she–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Ingrid, I think this is yours,” Byleth spoke up, handing her a curry comb from her box of stuff, “There’s also a jousting almanac and some horseshoes that I think are meant to be used for pegasi in here. One moment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...u-uh…thank you…professor?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome. Could any of you explain why Mercedes is praying to me? I find it uncomfortable.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sylvain couldn’t help himself. “What, you don’t like seeing a cute girl on her knees in front of you? I know I’d enjoy a sight like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Sylvain, this lipstick and this crumpled love letter are yours. I think this book about Sreng might also be yours, though I would like to borrow it, if I could. I like history books,” Byleth explained quite calmly, “Also, my respect for you has dropped immensely. Do better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh…gonna be honest I'm surprised you had any respect for me at all.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sylvain!” Ingrid shouted, knocked out of her stupor, before realizing who was there, “Wait, Professor, you're alive!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes? Well, unless this is some weird afterlife anyways.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then where have you been?! You've been missing for three years!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The void.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...The void?” Sylvain asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A dark, desolate place in which nothing is alive and I found myself close to the brink of insanity several times,” Byleth casually explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…oh, um…” Sylvain glanced at Ingrid and Annette, neither of whom were sure what to say to that, “...How are you alive?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. I don't want to get into the details. Long story short, the goddess gave me her powers.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That actually got Mercedes to stop praying, catching Byleth’s attention. She glanced down at the pious girl, who was staring at her fellow Lions with what looked like an uncharacteristically smug look on her face. “Isn’t that very interesting, everyone? The professor truly is an incarnation of the goddess. Oh, if only someone had mentioned such a thing all those years ago…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...is it weird that I find this side of her attractive?” Sylvain muttered, before tensing on reflex. When Ingrid didn’t elbow him, he gave her a concerned look. “Uh, Ingrid–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ingrid didn’t respond, instead promptly kneeling to Byleth. “P-Please forgive our families' trespasses, oh holy goddess! I swear, we had no idea we were wielding the bones of your children!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sothis’s children,” Byleth corrected, “I haven’t given birth to anybody. I think I would have noticed if I did.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“S-Still, it is my duty to atone for my families’ sins!” Ingrid said, before glancing at Annette and Sylvain, grabbing their sleeves and yanking them down to kneel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You really don’t need to do that–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are all of you kneeling on the floor?” Felix wondered as he turned the corner, staring at his friends and already looking like he wished he hadn’t asked that question. “Did the boar do something–Oh. Hey Professor. I thought you were dead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Felix,” Byleth greeted, unfazed. “No, I was just in the void.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The professor has come to grace us once again, to not only pass her holy judgment upon us but to also save Fodlan from what it's become,” Mercedes stated, as if it was obvious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great, she's in one of these moods again,” Felix sighed, looking exhausted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” Byleth glanced at the Lions, taking in how they all changed over the years, before setting her box down, and offering a hand to Mercedes. “There's no need to kneel to me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There is no need to show me mercy, Professor. I shall accept your judgment.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Grabbing Mercedes’s hand, Byleth pulled her up. “There is nothing for me to judge. You and your friends should not be judged for the sins of your ancestors. When this war is over, I believe Sothis would be happy to have the remains of her children buried, but if you truly wish to atone, all I ask is that you work alongside us until it is over.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Y-Yes. Yes, of course, professor,” Mercedes readily agreed, nodding her head as happy tears began to gather at her eyes. So it was only natural that Byleth gave her a hug, earning a slightly startled noise from the taller blonde. “O-Oh, um…thank you, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She returned the hug, smiling genuinely in her goddess’s embrace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so are we allowed to stand up now?” Annette murmured, glancing at Ingrid and Sylvain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…” Sylvain glanced at Byleth, who gave them a quick thumbs up before continuing to hug Mercedes. “Seems so.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is even going on…” Felix muttered, feeling his exhaustion rise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, you're really soft, Mercedes,” Byleth couldn't help but note once they finished hugging. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, thank you, professor. Annie tends to say the same thing, actually.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Makes sense. I've seen you practice with a bow at times, but you've mainly kept to magic right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That I have. Magic does come easier to me than standard weaponry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see. If you don't mind, would we be able to practice together later? I'm a bit rusty on my magic skills, so I would like to refine them.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course!” Mercedes agreed, looking very eager to help. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Don't tell me you're going to try and seduce Mercedes, Professor,” Sylvain said, trying to crack a joke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh no, I don't mean to be rude, but I would hate to intrude upon you, Dorothea, and Edelgard, professor. Ah, speaking of, are they here as well?” Mercedes asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Unfortunately, no. I’m planning to meet up with them soon though. I want to head to the Empire next to fix things over there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-Wait, you’re not going to help us take back the Kingdom?” Annette asked, a worried frown coming to her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not yet. Empire first, then Kingdom. I already fixed the Alliance and the Church, so now we do the Empire.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I guess that makes sense, tactically,” Ingrid commented, also frowning but looking thoughtful, “Our enemies in the Kingdom are organized under Rufus and fortified in Fhirdiad, whereas Edelgard’s forces are dealing with a rebellion. If Aegir’s dealt with, that frees the Empire up to help us…though, I’m not sure we really want to put ourselves in Adrestia’s debt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sylvain was looking thoughtful for a very different reason. “You just want to get together with your girlfriends, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would like to be cuddled, yes,” Byleth replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mercedes could provide that if you work for us,” Felix brought up, earning a scandalized noise from Annette.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Felix! Don’t offer Mercie as payment!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I would gladly tend to your needs, professor,” Mercedes offered, turning Annette’s scandalized gaze towards her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“M-Mercie! Don’t offer </span>
  <em>
    <span>yourself</span>
  </em>
  <span> as payment!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, but I’ll have to decline,” Byleth stated, “While the offer is tempting, I am no longer a mercenary and I don’t think it would be sufficient payment even if I was. Also, Mercedes, I’m fairly certain your brother is in the Empire right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Well, everyone, it seems I am going with Professor Byleth to the Empire–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“MERCEDES!” Annette practically wailed, earning a small pout from Mercedes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It won’t be that long…and besides, you could come with me.” She paused, a thought occurring. “Oh, and Constance would likely be there too, that is an added incentive to visit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I–You–Uh…hm.” Despite her instinctive reaction to refuse the idea of abandoning the Kingdom, even if it was just temporarily, Annette had to admit that she was tempted. “...maybe we should talk to Dimitri first?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You probably should,” Byleth agreed, “He should be talking with Rhea right now if you want to see him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Rhea is here too?!” Ingrid exclaimed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s still alive?” Felix asked, earning an immediate frown from Ingrid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Where was she these past few years?” Sylvain wondered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In the void with me,” Byleth readily answered, “She contributed to keeping me sane when she wasn’t driving me insane.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, did she also receive the goddess’s power?” Sylvain asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Something similar. You should ask her if you want any details, though don’t expect much. Rhea likes to keep things secret.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I did notice that…you know she tried to keep the Lance of Ruin way back when we took it from Miklan?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That does sound like her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-Well still, this power you got is really amazing, professor,” Annette said, speaking up, “I mean, you look almost exactly the same as when we last saw you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Ah, right. That's part of the power,” Byleth said, nodding while feeling strangely grateful that her hair covered her now pointy ears. That would have been awkward to explain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you talking about?” Felix asked, an eyebrow raised, “She has two eyes again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I-I know that,” Annette mumbled, having actually forgotten that would be unusual.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, that is weird,” Sylvain noted, “How’d that happen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Clearly it is a divine miracle of the goddess,” Mercedes stated primly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that,” Byleth agreed. She wasn’t even lying, it had absolutely been a miracle that her eye came back. Though she should probably keep the Nabatean thing more of a secret than she did back in Leicester.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh hey, here’s where you ran off to!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused, then glanced over at her sister as Shez approached with a big grin on her face. “Hello Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, hey yourself! So hey, did Mercedes start worshiping you the moment she saw–Oh, hey, Mercedes! And everybody else!” Shez beamed at her former classmates while the Lions all just kind of stared at the exuberant mercenary. “Long time no see–Oh, hang on, where’s Dedue and Ashe?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re out on a mission at the moment bringing supplies to one of the villages we’re protecting,” Felix explained, his arms crossed and his eyes narrowed, “Are you still possessed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope, I killed the ghost possessing me and it’s all good now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were possessed by a ghost?” Annette asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You weren’t under the control of a dark god?” Mercedes also asked, earning a bewildered blink from her friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, nope, not a dark god. Just a really dickish dark mage who thought he was more important than he was,” Shez explained, summing it up pretty concisely, in her opinion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can explain more later,” Byleth offered, before turning to her sister, “Is Rhea going to let us go to the Empire?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, uh…probably, but it might take a while–Hey, c’mon, don’t pout.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To the gathered Lions’ surprise, Byleth actually was visibly pouting instead of just looking neutrally displeased. “We should go sooner instead of later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I know you’re eager, but you’re the tactician here, right? Does it make tactical sense to go running off towards Adrestia without back-up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly! Besides, weren’t we going to go find those Knights of Reclamation guys at Zanado? You were the one that made that plan in the first place,” Shez pointed out, much to Byleth’s chagrin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, I understand. We’ll make preparations first. I still want to get to the Empire by the end of the month though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure, sounds like a plan to me. And hey, don’t worry too much. It’s not like we need to hurry or anything,” she assured, patting her sister on the back, “It’s not like anyone’s going anywhere.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>If asked, Victor would say he’d lived a decent life. Not in terms of morals, he’d gladly talk up how corrupt he’d been as a guard before becoming a mercenary, but in terms of contentment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sure, the merc life was rough, but he’d made friends, gotten a decent amount of money over the years, and lived about as comfortably as he cared to live. He knew in his heart that he was a man of violent means, not suited for living in a decent way, but happy with the life he’d had. It could’ve been better, but it could’ve been worse too.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Such were his thoughts amidst the roars and screeches of what had to be dozens of demonic beasts tearing through Zanado. And with more pouring into the canyon by the minute, he was pretty sure that number would go up to over a hundred.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The day started off fine enough. He couldn’t say he really liked hanging around with the zealous weirdos that made up the Knights of Reclamation, but a job was a job and Captain Jeralt told him and Candace to keep an eye on them until he got back, so that’s what Victor did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All told, it wasn’t too different from living in a merc camp, just with higher standards for polished weapons and armor, and way too much praying. Candace seemed to enjoy herself though, telling stories about the captain’s kids to a captivated audience who seemed to take every childhood story as a possible gospel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was right in the middle of telling a tale about Byleth’s first time riding a horse when they first heard the sound of a flute playing on the breeze, followed by a demonic screech. The flap of heavy, featherless wings echoed throughout the canyon before a sudden wave of monsters struck the Reclamation camps. Then it was chaos.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey Vic, did you know these demonic beasts traveled in herds?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor blinked, stirred from his thoughts as he glanced over at Candace, a bloodied spear in her hand and a genuinely curious look on her face, like she hadn’t just asked a stupid question. Though, come to think of it… “I don’t think it’s a herd if they’re predators, right? Herds are for cattle and sheep, it’d be like a pack of wolves or bears.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do bears travel in packs?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…” He didn’t know the answer to that. “Is that really the kind of question you should be asking right now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess not? I’m just not super sure what to talk about while we’re hiding.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re not hiding, we’re taking cover,” Victor corrected, before peeking over the stack of crates they were hiding behind just in time to see two beasts manage to bring down one of the guardian golems. “Damn, there goes another one…we might need to make a tactical retreat here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, we’re running?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Tactically</span>
  </em>
  <span>! It ain’t craven if it’s tactical.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah alright, sounds good to me.” She moved up beside him, scanning the bloodied canyon as knights screamed their defiance against the brutal beasts. “You think we could take some folks with us? Don’t feel right to just leave ‘em to die.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If they wanna retreat, they can go for it. What we’re doing is being tactical. The captain needs to know things went wrong, right? So we should be smart about it. Maybe grab some horses so we’ll be faster.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, maybe we can get a pegasus–“ The pair of mercenaries paused as an audible crunch sounded out, followed by a scream of terror that ended abruptly as a pegasus knight hit the ground. They glanced upwards, saw the swarm of flying beasts going after everything in the sky, and came to a better decision. “Horses are fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Horses are great,” Victor agreed, “Hell, pegasi are pretentious anyway, with their fancy wings and stupid high flying ways.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s pretentious mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It means like nobles.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ohh…aren’t you just mad because pegasi won’t let you get on them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not mad, and they’re pretentious anyway. Now c’mon, let’s find a way outta here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was easier said than done, but the pair of mercenaries were at least able to maneuver through the chaotic canyon without being immediately crushed or eaten by the hulking monstrosities that were ripping their way through everything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“RALLY TO ME, KNIGHTS OF RECLAMATION!” declared one of those cardinal guys, waving a staff as a way of gathering up the scattered knights. Victor, of course, immediately decided to avoid that area, though it wasn’t long before they bumped into another one of the robed cardinals.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You two! Captain Jeralt’s subordinates! Fantastic, you’re still alive,” the man said, sounding genuinely pleased to see them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor couldn’t really say the same. “Ah, yeah, hey, uh…Cardinal! What’s up, what’s your plan? Candace and I were thinking–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No time for that! We need to hurry. We cannot allow these monstrosities to defile the sacred land of Zanado no matter what happens! We all must lay down our lives if necessary to keep it safe!” There was a familiar, zealous look in the cardinal’s weirdly bright green eyes that Victor definitely didn’t like.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, uh, well, me and Candace were actually about–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why’re your eyes green, Bernhard?” Candace spoke up, a frown on her face, “Thought they were blue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” The cardinal blinked, confusion entering those strange eyes of his. Which, now that Victor looked, seemed to be glowing. “I…h-hold now, what is that…why do I feel…?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A full body shudder went through him as his skin started to pale. Though, no, it wasn’t paling. There were white scales growing across the cardinal’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor shoved him back, knocking the cardinal to the ground before he grabbed Candace and just started moving, getting away from whatever the hell that was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, hang on, shouldn’t we–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope, we’re not helping, we’re not staying, and we sure as hell ain’t fighting whatever that was!” Victor declared, before going right for the closest horse he spotted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The steed sure as hell wasn’t happy with all the blood, noise, and monsters around it, practically wailing with fear in a horsey way, but Candace was always good with the big animals so Victor let her calm it down while he kept an eye out for more trouble. And there definitely was more trouble coming considered there were now giant white beasts in the mix, shrieking and biting at the other monsters.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are there white ones now?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Some animals are albino,” Candace pointed out while petting the trembling horse’s snout, “There there, that’s a good girl…ah, albino means they’re white for some reason.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know what albino means! It’s like the little princess or Shez’s noble friend!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, those two…aw, I miss Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I do too, but is now really the time–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, it’s sweet to hear even random soldiers like my sister,” came a voice from nearby. One that sent an immediate shiver down Victor’s spine, an instinctive sense of danger making him very wary as he turned to look at a cloaked man perching on a nearby crate, looking a lot like the bird his mask resembles. “Though, you two don’t seem like the rest of these peons. You’re still generic-looking trash, but you’re not wearing white or blue like these zealots…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stranger cocked his head, studying them. “So now I’m curious. Just how do you know my twin?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…last I checked, Captain Jeralt doesn’t have a son,” Victor replied, moving in front of Candance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do I need to be his son to be Shez’s brother? She did have a mother at one point.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She would’ve mentioned you.” He tightened his grip on his axe’s handle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not if she didn’t know about me.” He tilted his head the other way, the light of the flames nearby glinting in the lenses of his mask. “You didn’t answer my question. Or, hm, maybe you did. You did say ‘Captain Jeralt’. So you’re one of his.” He turned his head, looking curiously at the destruction around them. “Is he around? Because I have some thoughts–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Most mercenaries weren’t particularly loyal individuals. It was a rough type of career that tended to reward callous disregard for those around them, particularly since yesterday’s ally might be tomorrow’s enemy. Yet when a person spends years and years fighting alongside someone, it was almost unthinkable that there wouldn’t be a sort of trust formed between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor wasn’t sure when he decided he wasn’t getting out of this situation alive, but he didn’t even need to look at Candace for a sudden sense of understanding to hit the blonde merc. And so, in a swift, almost synchronized motion, Victor lunged for the man in the mask as Candace hopped on the horse and immediately urged the beast into a full gallop away from them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” The masked man stared curiously at the axe he’d caught on his sword, the blade inches from his skull. “I coulda sworn I was being cordial. Did I mess up somewhere?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah,” Victor replied, his muscles straining as he tried to drive the axe in, “I just don’t like your attitude, brat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Well that’s a shame, I guess I’ll have to work on that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he vanished and Victor stumbled, his eyes going wide right before he let out a choked grunt. He looked down at the black blade protruding from his chest, only briefly registering the sight before it suddenly went upwards.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Man, this sucks. I really thought I could get something useful here…ah well. It’s not like anybody will miss some random wretch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Victor blinked, a bit surprised to see a blue sky overhead. He would’ve thought the smoke would cover it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, it wasn’t the worst sight to die seeing. Such were his thoughts right before his head hit the ground.</span>

  <em>
    <span>Ensure the elder Eisner sister is given the position as professor. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea’s instructions had been simple, so simple that not even her most foolish of knights would be able to mess it up. The elder Eisner sister, Byleth Eisner, would be made a professor, all to ensure that her mother's vessel stayed at the academy. Rhea would have preferred offering her the position herself, yet as the archbishop she still had business to attend to, namely punishing the former professor who had abandoned his students. It had been quite a while since circumstances allowed her to bring out the pliers again, and she wanted to savor the moment, perhaps to the detriment of her schedule.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regardless, she'd be able to greet the vessel of the goddess the next morning once she chose which class to join. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want to teach the Lions!” Shez stated, a large smile on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'd prefer to join the Black Eagles,” Byleth stated, getting Shez to frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, why aren't you joining my class?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you join my class if I was the professor?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...okay, yeah, I guess that’s fine then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea looked at Shez, then Byleth, then Shez again, before blinking at Jeralt. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez wants the lion class, and Byleth wants to join the Eagles. I thought that was obvious,” the mercenary captain stated, “Not sure why you wanted Shez as a teacher, but your toady made it clear refusing wasn’t an option.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea glanced at Seteth, who nodded to her unasked question. He had no idea why the archbishop wanted Shez Eisner as a teacher either, but he obeyed the instructions as given.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I see. Hm.” Rhea, meanwhile, was reminded that everyone around her was an idiot and this was why she was in charge because none of these morons could find their own backside with two hands and a map. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Well, at least she’ll still be staying at the academy either way. Still, this does ruin some plans…</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Very well then. I believe you will be needing a uniform then, Byleth, and Shez…ah…why don’t you speak to Hanneman and Manuela? Perhaps they can aid you in putting together a lesson plan.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh I don’t need that, I’ve already got loads of plans already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For some reason, the young woman’s confidence did not reassure Rhea.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Hm. So this is what it’s like wearing a skirt,” Byleth noted to herself, now dressed in the academy uniform. She’d decided to go for the silver version instead of the standard color, mostly because it just looked better to her, and she had to admit, she enjoyed how swishy her new outfit felt. “Swish swish…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She should probably make sure not to kick too high while wearing it though. It probably wouldn’t be too much of an issue, but she heard something about some students being ‘skirt-chasers’ and now that she was wearing a skirt, she might be a target of those hostile students.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I may not know why they dislike skirts, but I shall be ready for them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not…never mind,” Sothis muttered as Byleth headed out of her room, ready to greet the day.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, was not ready to greet the day. In fact, she was still in bed, not dressed in the slightest, and was currently being semi-metaphorically poked by her own ghostly companion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Metaphorically because Arval couldn’t actually touch her face to poke her properly. “Partner. Partner. Wake up, partner.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mffhgl…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Partner, you’re a teacher now, you need to attend your class.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Grng…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Your sister is about to eat your snacks,” Arval muttered with a blank expression, causing her to snap up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She wouldn't!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh good, you’ve awakened. You have a class to teach.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, right, shit, I’m a professor now! Uh–No, wait, why would I even be worried? I can just warp to the class–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Get dressed first,” Arval interrupted, well aware of how things would go if they didn’t. They knew their partner could be foolish, but showing up to her first class in her undergarments would send a very wrong message to her students.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, clothes. Ugh, damn it, I let my guard down because the bed was comfy…” Shez grumbled as she picked out an outfit for the day–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you really going to wear your regular mercenary clothes to class?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Uh…should I not? I think it looks pretty good and it wasn’t like the other professors had uniforms.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine, you're going to be late enough as is,” Arval huffed as Shez got dressed before heading out to her class. Soon enough, she was standing in front of the Blue Lions class, a wide smile on her face before she pushed it open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey there, sorry if I'm late, still getting used to this!” Shez stated as the Lions turned to the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Professor, we were starting to get worried something had happened to you.” Dimitri said, greeting the mercenary as the Lions crowded around her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah don't worry about it, I just went to sleep late by accident. Still, since we're late, I figure we can go straight to it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, what do you have planned, Professor?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, since we have the mock battle in a few weeks, I figured the best thing to do is simple,” Shez gave everyone a large smile, “A spar, all of you against me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Uh, professor–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds good to me,” Felix immediately agreed, looking far more interested already, “Right here, or at the training yard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Felix, you can’t fight in the class–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We have a training yard?” Shez asked, before pausing, “Actually, yeah, that makes way more sense! Come on everybody, let’s go to the training yard!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Lions glanced at one another for a moment, before Felix abruptly began to follow her, signaling to the rest to move as well. Hopefully it wouldn't be that bad, the students thought, unaware of how intense the sparring would be. Though hey, at least only three of them wound up puking from exhaustion. That was pretty good for a first day, in Shez’s professional and inaccurate opinion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Byleth was having a relatively simple lesson, listening attentively as Manuela laid out her plans for the mock battle. Even if it wasn't necessary for Byleth to listen, since she had been informed she wouldn't be allowed to participate. Still, she wanted to leave a good first impression. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, how'd your first day of class go?” her classmate Dorothea asked, smiling down at the mercenary. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well enough, I suppose. I am somewhat lacking in magic skills, so once Manuela begins to teach more on that, I'll be content.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well you're in luck, Manuela only taught me for a short while back when she was at the Opera House, but I can assure you that she's an excellent teacher,” Dorothea said, walking alongside Byleth as they left class, “Ah, but enough about that, I was hoping to learn more about you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? How so?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I figured a beautiful mercenary like you must have been quite popular while traveling around. Any romantic tales you want to share~?” Dorothea asked, hoping to hear about any worthwhile nobles who could be a potential option down the line. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, my apologies, I don't have much experience with that. I don't attract much attention in terms of romantic matters.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really, no experience at all?” Dorothea asked, a bit surprised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“None,” Byleth replied, before pausing as she glanced at the songstress, her eyes lingering on her fellow student’s figure. It was just an errant thought, but, well…they both were students, so it should be okay, “Unless you wish to help me, that is.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea paused, then immediately smiled in a far more flirtatious way as she leaned towards the mercenary, angling her posture to give Byleth a very good look down the front of her shirt. “Of course, I’d love to help you learn all about romance~ Why don’t we find somewhere private so I can tutor you, hm~?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth, who had been staring straight at the enticing sight offered to her by the flirtatious songstress, needed a second to actually respond. “...sure. That sounds good to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great, let’s get going then~” And with that, Dorothea quite eagerly led her new friend off, happy to teach her all about “romance”. Sure, she’d probably still be looking for a rich noble afterwards, considering life as a mercenary definitely didn’t appeal to her, but she could at least help a cute girl get some experience.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“So how have classes been?” Byleth asked Shez, as they sat down for a meal together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh going great! Well, for the most part. The class still can't stack up against me in a fight, but they've been improving!” Shez answered with a smile on her face, “Dimitri even managed to land a hit on me yesterday. It was a glancing one, but still.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, either you're taking it easy on them, or they're more talented than I expected.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, a bit of both. I haven't used my awakened form, but they're fast learners,” Shez responded, taking a bite out of her chicken, “Anyways, how are things with you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Going well, I have a girlfriend now.” Byleth stated getting Shez to gag on poultry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What!? Since when!?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“First day, I suppose. She wants to keep things casual, so we haven't gone around telling anyone, but it's been nice,” Byleth explained, thinking about all the ‘tutoring’ Dorothea gave her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And why didn't you tell me!?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am now,” Byleth said as Shez frowned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then tell me who it is.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It's–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah there you are, Byleth, I hope I'm not interrupting something important.” Pausing, Byleth glanced over to see Edelgard standing nearby. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hello, did you need something?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I was hoping we would be able to squeeze in one more sparring match before the mock battle tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don't mind, it's nice spending time with you, Edelgard,” Byleth said, before pausing when she heard a gasp from beside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So this is who it is!” Shez ‘realized’, pointing at Edelgard, “You’re dating the princess!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked, caught off guard. “Er, what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t think you can hide it from me!” Shez reiterated, before pausing, “Hm, is this why you kept your relationship a secret? You didn’t want anyone to realize the princess seduced you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Edelgard didn’t seduce me,” Byleth responded, nonplussed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh? Well I know you didn’t seduce her, you’re not that good with relationships.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m better than you are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah right. I don't want to call you a liar, By, but I doubt you know how to flirt.” Shez huffed, getting Byleth to frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” Standing up, Byleth turned to face Edelgard, who took a step back as the mercenary stepped forward. “My Lady, I apologize for my sister. If you would do me the honor of joining me, I'd be happy to spend time alone with you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh?” A bit caught off guard, Edelgard glanced down at Byleth’s offered hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing would make me happier than you accepting my offer.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Still fairly bewildered and bemused, Edelgard decided to accept her classmate’s hand. She wasn’t expecting Byleth to bring her hand to her lips and kiss it, though she had enough decorum not to blush at the gesture. She did feel flustered though. “T-Then we should go, Byleth.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gladly.” Offering the princess her arm, the two were soon off, leaving Shez alone as she watched them walk off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...When the hell did she learn how to do that?” Letting out a huff, she leaned back, hoping her sister wouldn't become a flirt. She didn’t want to see her turn into Sylvain.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>It turned out, Shez didn’t need to worry about Byleth turning into Sylvain. Mostly because Sylvain wished he could be as successful as Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me, Professor.” Pausing in the middle of grading papers, Shez glanced up to see Mercedes standing by her desk. “I hope I'm not bothering you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh hey, Mercedes, don't worry about it! This was boring anyways,” Shez responded, setting her quill down, “What's up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I wanted to inform you I was planning on transferring to the Black Eagles.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Wait, why? Don't tell me this is because of the mock battle.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don't worry Professor, I wouldn't hold a grudge over something so silly, especially since it was a month ago. This is more due to…personal reasons,” Mercedes explained, glancing away from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? If there's something wrong, you can tell me,” Shez offered, racking her brains as she tried to figure out what could be the problem, before remembering something from last night. Specifically, she remembered seeing Mercedes having a tea party with Byleth. “...This is because of Byleth, isn't it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The older girl blushed, her face turning a light shade of pink as she averted her gaze. “Er…well, I just…think it may be better for my current studies if I join Byleth’s class. I mean no offense, professor, I just think I would be better suited in the Eagles classroom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What, are you going to raise your Faith by ‘praying’ to Byleth?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Shez thought but didn’t say. Instead, she just sighed. “Yeah, alright, if that’s what you want…hm…no, you know what, fuck that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Mercedes blinked, a little alarmed. “Professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mercedes, you can join Byleth’s class, sure, but I guarantee to you that I’m gonna grab you back before the end of the year! In fact, I’m gonna snatch up all the other students so my class will win everything, all the time, forever!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-Ah…good luck with that, Professor?” Mercedes said, though it seemed Shez didn't hear her as she began to form a plot to snatch all the students. Though it seemed her devious plot wouldn't go unnoticed when Byleth marched up to her later while she was practicing her swordplay at the training yard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You're not allowed to steal my girlfriends. Get your own,” Byleth demanded, earning a scoff from her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh please, you can’t tell me what to do. I outrank you in the school hierarchy!” Shez declared with a big grin, radiating smugness, “And besides, I’m not stealing your girlfriends, I’m stealing your classmates. There’s a difference.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not really.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...the hell’s that mean?” Shez asked, only to see Byleth pout. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don't want them to leave.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Seriously? Are you that attached to Emily?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If they’re not dating me, I still want them to be my friends,” Byleth insisted, still pouting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...well, fine, I guess I won’t steal your classmates specifically, but no more stealing my students!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm…that should be fine, I don’t think you have anyone else I would like kissing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That–So you admit it’s for horny reasons!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “I like kissing.” She tilted her head. “You should try getting a girlfriend. Or boyfriend. Or both.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And whom am I supposed to date, huh? I can't date any students, and the only staff who aren’t that older than me are Catherine and Shamir. Which I'm definitely not doing since that feels like a giant headache.” Shez huffed, before pausing, “...I guess the librarian is cute.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Tomas?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No! I meant the assistant Librarian. I think her name is Selene?” Shez said, considering the question, “She seems nice enough.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay. Good luck Shez. I can give you some tips if you need them.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am not taking flirting advice from you.” Rolling her eyes, Shez began to walk away, before turning around. “Also I call dibs on the Deer students first!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, fair enough,” Byleth replied, waving Shez off, before heading off herself, not wanting to be late for her date. Besides what was the worst that could happen? Shez gets rejected? </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Byleth wasn't sure how exactly the library caught on fire, but she was going to at least keep quiet about the possibility that it was Shez’s fault. Thankfully, the knights managed to save the books before the flames spread too far, and there was mainly just some damage to some furniture. Still classes were canceled for the day as the staff tried to get everything sorted out and made sure no one was injured. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Granted, part of that “sorting out” was apparently trying to track down Selene and Tomas since they turned out to be weirdly pale infiltrators.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth was just happy she was in town when that happened, though it did mean her date was interrupted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So it wasn't a no at least,” Shez started as the two sat in the courtyard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But it wasn't a yes.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up. It could’ve been a yes if that old guy didn’t interrupt,” Shez complained, before letting out a huff and laying down, “I bet if I was a student, I'd have tons of people to kiss.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That's what you get for stealing that bandit boss kill.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Are you seriously miffed about that?” Shez asked, a bit surprised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not really, but also thinking back on it, it would have been nice showing off to Edelgard more.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Didn't you already save her life?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hence why I said more.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez huffed again. “Still don't know how you’re dating so many people.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm just that loveable. That and Dorothea says I'm a natural–” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No details, I don't need to hear that,” Shez requested with a grimace, “I'm really lucky you aren't dating Sylvain, that would have been horrible.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did think about it. But Dorothea wasn't into the idea, and I was dating her first, so yeah.” Byleth paused, thinking. “I think she actually said ‘not Sylvain, never Sylvain’ specifically.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Hm. So, seriously, when did you become such a flirt?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I discovered a natural talent for seduction. And also I find a lot of people here attractive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Feh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth glanced at Shez. “You could always just quit being a professor. Maybe Papa would take over for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Screw that, I’m not giving up! I never give up!” Shez insisted, giving her sister a determined glare, “I’m going to be the best damn teacher this school has ever seen! I’ll win at being a teacher! And I’ll seduce someone hot too!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth looked back at the still smoking library. “Hm…maybe try again away from the monastery next time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–...yeah, that might be a good idea…”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Rhea took a deep, exasperated breath. “Professor Eisner…how did you start a war with the Kingdom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, look, </span>
  <em>
    <span>technically</span>
  </em>
  <span> it was only supposed to be a war with the Western Church,” Shez began, “And even then I’d say it was less a war and more an ass–No, wait, shouldn’t say it was an assassination…uh…” She visibly tried to think of an excuse. “...it was peacekeeping.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You killed the Bishop of the West, Count Rowe, and, somehow, Miklan Gautier, while also burning Arianrhod to the ground.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, hang on, that last part was Dimitri’s fault.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I take full responsibility for my actions…” the house leader stated, his head bowed in obvious shame.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But, hey, good news! I did complete the mission to assassinate Lord Lonato–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t an assassination, stop saying that,” Rhea insisted, before sighing again, pinching the bridge of her nose, “Why do you keep using that word anyway?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, because of the letter we found that said people were trying to assassinate you. That’s why I did the Western Church thing, and then things kind of…spiraled?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How do things ‘spiral’ into you burning down the Kingdom’s second largest city?” Seteth asked, openly baffled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Arianrhod is a city? I thought it was a fort?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s both, professor,” Dimitri pointed out, his head still bowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, weird. Well…I’m pretty sure it had something to do with the Tragedy of Duscur. Probably.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea blinked. “What?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, Dimitri, mind explaining?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When we were searching for evidence of who was attempting to assassinate you, we were led to the Western Church, which in turn unearthed evidence that led to potential perpetrators behind the Tragedy of Duscur,” Dimitri stated, his hands clenched into fists at his sides, “The Western Church might not have been behind it, but they were working with someone who potentially did, which led us to Arianhod.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And while we were there, Dimitri tried to question Rowe,” Shez continued, picking up where he left off, “And, well…one thing led to another and we had to fight off his men while trying to escape.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And how does that involve burning the city to the ground?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That…I'm not sure?” Shez said, glancing at Dimitri. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“While we were there, I discovered the Court Mage Cornelia there, who believed I had discovered her secret before escaping. Soon afterwards, as we were attempting to escape as well, several demonic beasts seemed to appear from nowhere to lay waste to the city.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it's like they were summoned,” Shez said, frowning, “After that, well, Dimitri realized that if Cornelia was at least a bit behind the tragedy, there's one obvious person who was assisting her. So I sent a letter of formal declaration of war to Rufus.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Please tell me you're joking,” Seteth requested incredulously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, she is not,” Dimitri stated, “When she sent the letter, I requested we return here so we may request aid to tear those monsters to shreds.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea realized the young man wasn't bowing his head in shame, but in barely constrained rage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And where exactly does Miklan come into play?” Seteth asked, choosing not to broach Dimitri’s request at the moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…whose Miklan again?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The bandit with the scar on his face,” Dimitri explained, “He was Sylvain's brother.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh! Oh no, I should apologize to him…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don't think you need to. He's not fond of him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, that one is on me. Just kinda got lost and bumped into him when we were going to Arianhod,” Shez said, before shrugging, “Dude was a creep so I killed him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well this explains why you've been gone for over a month…” Rhea muttered, feeling exhausted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, speaking of, how's Byleth? Didn't get to talk to her on my way up, so I wanted to know if anything happened to her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I believe she is spending time with Edelgard,” Rhea answered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I still find it inappropriate that she's seeing multiple people,” Seteth huffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Wait, at the same time?” Rhea asked, a bit surprised, “Is it serious?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe? Last I knew, she was dating Dorothea, Edelgard, and Mercedes. Don't know if it's gotten serious, but they seemed to be doing well,” Shez explained, before pausing as the door suddenly opened. Turning around, she smiled at who walked in, “Oh, hey By, we were just talking about you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? What about?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You and your girlfriends. Rhea wanted to know if it had gotten serious for some reason.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, I'm not sure? Things are starting to get serious with Edelgard, but Mercedes seems to be dealing with something with her dad?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh, did you offer to beat him up?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” Byleth said with a nod, “As for Dorothea, it's still casual. As far as I'm aware she's still looking for a rich noble.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, does she think you aren't good enough?” Rhea asked, suddenly serious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Rhea, is this really appro–” Seteth began, before pausing when Rhea held up a hand and shushed him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Byleth, please continue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Well, from what Dorothea’s told me, she’s fine helping me ‘learn the ropes’, and she has told me that I’m sweet and soft like a teddy bear, but she needs to marry someone with money to live a comfortable life and being a traveling mercenary doesn’t seem like it would work well with her life plans.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Are teddy bears sweet?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think so. The ‘sweet’ part was a separate compliment.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should not be with someone who doesn't value you if you don't have money,” Rhea advised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “I think it’s fine. Like Dorothea said, at least we can’t get pregnant.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Miss Byleth, that is deeply inappropriate to speak of in the archbishop’s chambers,” Seteth reprimanded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah By, I'm gonna have to give you detention for that,” Shez said with a grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you’re not my professor,” Byleth pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah but I still have that power. Right Seteth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You do, yes. And even if you didn't, she would still get punished for saying such things,” Seteth said, before shaking his head, “Regardless, is there a reason why you're here, Miss Byleth?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right. Apparently some disaster is happening in the Empire so while Edelgard is getting everyone ready, I came up to see if we could get help.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What??” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I requested aid first,” Dimitri said, speaking up and reminding everyone he was there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, yeah, we were here first!” Shez pointed out, “What’s going on in the Empire that’s so important? It’s not like we don’t have a war going on too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shrugged. “I don’t really know, but apparently it involves a gigantic demonic beast abducting the prime minister and climbing to the top of Enbarr’s palace.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea blinked. “What.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A gigantic demonic–How in the world did that happen!?” Seteth demanded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, all the way down in the capital of the Empire, a certain man named Myson sat on a hill outside the city limits, watching as his intended masterpiece screeched in rage at the wyvern and pegasus knights trying to rescue a screaming Duke Aegir from its clutches, one enormous hand clutching onto the top spire of Enbarr Palace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Odesse?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Lord Myson?” responded his bird-masked attendant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s blame Chilon for this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Lord Myson.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Back at the monastery, Byleth shrugged again. “Not sure. So yeah, can we have help with that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Again, I asked first,” Dimitri stated irritably.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but I’m pretty sure your thing is just a you problem. My thing is a me problem, so it matters more.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pff-” Shez tried to cover her snort, clearing her throat and attempting to look professional. “C’mon Byleth, you’re being kinda rude there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, she has a point,” Rhea commented, earning a baffled look from Seteth, “This really is a ‘you’ problem, Dimitri, and the church does not get involved with ‘you’ problems. So, what was it you wanted us to do to support you, Byleth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…can I borrow Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, she can be your new professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, what?” Shez blinked. “Hang on, what about the war thing? Also, wait, I can’t be Byleth’s professor! I need to beat her class at school stuff!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor Shez, clearly there is a set of priorities here,” Rhea began, “You can always have your competition with your sister at a later date. As for the ‘war’ with Faerghus, I will simply send a message to the regent telling him the previous letter was a mistake and clearly we were just declaring war on Mach again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mach? What’s Mach? Is that like a secret fourth nation of Fodlan?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” Rhea lied, “Now then, let’s focus on the immediately relevant, pressing disaster in the Empire and hope we don’t have anything else happen in the next few–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Rhea, the Almyrans are invading!” Alois shouted as he ran into the audience chamber, “The Locket has fallen and half the mountains are on fire!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would they set fire to the mountains?” Seteth asked, bewildered, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>How</span>
  </em>
  <span> would they set fire to the mountains?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...okay, that is a concern,” Rhea noted, “Perhaps we should prioritize–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“LADY RHEA!” Catherine shouted as she burst into the room, “Sreng’s invading from the north and just took Fhirdiad!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They did? How?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Apparently Lady Cornelia just opened the gates for them!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That witch…” Dimitri grumbled, prompting Shez to pat him on the head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There there, we’ll kill her later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” Rhea was starting to see a pattern. And that pattern seemed to come to fruition when Shamir entered the room too. “Let me guess. Dagda is invading?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope,” the archer replied, unruffled as ever.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Why are you here then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Some kind of umbral beast is crawling on the monastery and I wanted to see if you noticed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea blinked, then glanced behind her, out of the window of her audience chamber, where a massive, monstrous, skull-headed creature was peeking through the glass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>“...Sitri?”</b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea turned back to the group. “...Professor Shez, I’m not sure how, but I’m fairly certain this is your fault.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–I was gone for a month! How could this all be my fault!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, wait.” Byleth raised a hand. “I think the umbral thing might be my fault. Sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course it isn’t your fault,” Rhea reassured, before Seteth spoke up with audible annoyance in his voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How is it your fault, Byleth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Friend of my mom’s asked me for a chalice, I got it for him, then was kind of busy taking Edelgard on a double date with these two cuties I met down there. Apparently the redheaded one, Hapi, can make demonic beasts show up when she sighs, and she did sigh on the date. Not sure why there was a delay though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, she can do what?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Her sighs summon demonic beasts. Though well, I suppose it wasn't a sigh, more so a m–” Whatever Byleth was about to say was cut off as the demonic beast smashed its forearm through the window, grabbing onto her and pulling her out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–Hey get back here!” Shez shouted, leaping out the window to grab onto the beast as it crawled away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea couldn't help but let out a sigh, hoping things didn't get more out of hand. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Somehow Sitri was alive. Rhea wasn’t quite sure how that happened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, no, she did have something of an idea, considering she was there for the whole “Umbral Beast Incident”, wherein apparently Aelfric, of all people, decided to use the Chalice of Beginnings to resurrect his childhood friend, who he was apparently a lot more obsessed with than Rhea realized. It was probably a good thing he was dead now, otherwise things would’ve been even more awkward…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So. To sum up this whole…series of events,” Jeralt began, looking very unimpressed, “Instead of burying Sitri after her death like a normal person, you, Rhea, decided to just put her body down in Abyss.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I feel like I should be given more benefit of the doubt than that,” Rhea murmured, only to pause when Jeralt glared at her. “...hmph.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Some time later, Aelfric found her, went crazy, and decided to do a ritual to bring her back to life involving an artifact that ‘Saint Seiros’–” He gave Rhea another pointed look. “–made to bring the goddess back to life. This ritual involved sacrificing the lives of four kids with the crests of the Apostles, but because two of them were apparently ‘busy’–” He deliberately did not look at his daughter at that moment. “–he tried using substitutes, which apparently included a number of mercenaries, some bones he found in Abyss, and Zanado fruits, for some reason.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To be fair to the psycho, didn’t it wind up working?” Shez pointed out, gesturing towards Sitri, who was sitting on a couch Rhea had brought up to her office so she could lay down. Which she wasn’t actually doing, having instead decided to let Byleth rest her head in her lap while she hummed a familiar lullaby.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kid, turning himself and a bunch of other people into a gigantic demonic beast–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Umbral beast,” Sitri corrected, before going back to stroking Byleth’s hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, that. Either way, I don’t think he would’ve counted it as a success,” Jeralt muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh, the dude was weird enough to try all this just for her, he probably thinks it was a success,” Shez pointed out, before shrugging, “It's just a good thing Byleth only got knocked out.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I'm happy I didn't hurt her too badly,” Sitri said with a sigh, before glancing at Shez, “Thank you again, for rescuing me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, no need to thank me. I don't even know what I did,” Shez said, remembering how her powers interacted oddly with the umbral beast, “Besides, if I didn't I'm sure everyone else who showed up would have figured something out.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I, uh…certainly didn't expect Byleth to have so many…close friends who showed up to save her,” Sitri muttered, feeling her face heat up, remembering how she came to awareness with nothing but black blood covering her otherwise bare body. Which would have been uncomfortable enough, but the fact that the majority of her rescuers were clearly enamored with her daughter made things that much more awkward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fortunately, the other components of the umbral beast waking up seemed to have distracted everyone, particularly that one admittedly well-built young man who declared himself the “Naked King of Grappling!”. He certainly was attention grabbing, for more than one reason.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It's a shame he got knocked out by Jeralt for trying to flirt with her, but she had to admit, being swept up in her husband’s arms and carried away by him with his cape for cover was quite nice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, they’re not just her friends, they’re her girlfriends,” Shez shamelessly stated, earning a sigh from Jeralt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, don’t tattle on your sister.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How is that tattling?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I already had an inkling that was the case, but I didn't want to assume,” Sitri said, before glancing at Jeralt, “You have made sure to talk with them, correct?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“About what?” The captain asked, raising an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“About making sure none of them break her heart, and to be careful,” Sitri responded with a frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sitri, she can take care of herself,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She's just a baby!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...She's twenty.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That–...no, she is not. My daughter is not the same age as me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so, hey, does this mean I’m officially the older sister?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea paused. “What do you mean ‘officially’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, it’s a whole thing I do with Byleth,” Shez explained, “Basically, since nobody’s sure how old I actually am–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re pretty sure she’s at least two years younger,” Jeralt stated, though Shez ignored him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–me and Byleth decided to do a thing where I can be the older sister if I beat her in these competitions we have, like taking out the leader of a bandit band or doing more push-ups.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so you are not, actually, the older Eisner sister,” Rhea noted, feeling a headache coming on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, no, I guess–Look, clearly I am because Miss Sitri said I am. Right, Miss Sitri?” she asked, turning towards Byleth’s mom, before pausing when she noticed Sitri was staring at her quite intently. “Uh…Miss Sitri?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…” Sitri stared at her for a few more seconds, before coming to some kind of conclusion and patting the cushion next to her. “Sit here, please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then, after a bewildered look towards a nonplussed Jeralt, walked over and sat beside Sitri, who promptly began patting her on the head. “...um–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can lay down too if you want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, I think I'm good,” Shez said, feeling awkward even if it felt nice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, well, I just want you to know, though we have just met, I can tell you care deeply for Byleth. As such, I would like to think of you as my daughter as well, if you are okay with that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…well, just…I'm not going to call you mom, but I guess that isn't bad,” Shez said, looking away with a faintly flustered look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm happy to hear that,” Sitri said, with a smile, before glancing at Rhea, “Well Lady Rhea, I suppose you now officially have two grandchildren.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt blinked. “What.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, did I never mention Lady Rhea is my creator?” Sitri asked, looking curiously at her husband, “My apologies, I suppose it never came up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…Yeah. I guess it didn’t,” Jeralt echoed, staring pointedly at Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, why did you say ‘creator’ and not mom?” Shez asked, getting Sitri to stiffen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, I believe we have a war we need to focus on. Well, several really, and an incident with an entirely different demonic beast. Those are all much more important than focusing too much on the accidental use of one word instead of another,” Rhea said, clapping her hands together in an attempt to move the conversation along. Now hopefully this would be settled quickly and she wouldn’t have to deal with any more nonsense.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Rhea sat on a hill, her legs against her chest as she stared at the merrily burning flames that had engulfed Garreg Mach. It was beautiful, in a strange way, how the flames flickered and danced above the ruin of her life’s work.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...okay, this wasn’t my fault,” Shez stated, also sitting on the hill a little ways away, “I want to make that very clear. You can blame me for the Kingdom exploding, but not for this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Doesn't that technically fall on you and Lysithea?” Byleth asked, sitting beside her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well yeah, but as the Professor I take full blame for it. And even then it's not like we could have known that black water was super flammable.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course they couldn’t, because Rhea had hidden the information on the foul black water and everything related to it. Did that technically make the Kingdom’s destruction her fault?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>…no. No, the Agarthans are to blame,</span>
  </em>
  <span> she mentally decided, before sighing. “I don’t blame you for the monastery burning, Professor Shez. I mostly blame Seteth.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...yeah, it was kinda his fault,” Shez agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mostly his,” Byleth echoed, “...Good news though, Edelgard is willing to host us at Enbarr once they get the palace fixed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that’s very kind of–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re only invited if you step down from being archbishop, Rhea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” The problem was, that actually sounded fair at this point. “...is this about the Almyrans?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> about them. I think it’s all the other stuff though, like the legion of dragons you kept in the basement.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They were crest stones when I put them down there–Never mind.” Rhea sighed again, ignoring the distant sounds of screeching and the roar of flames.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright sweet, I'll tell my students we're going on a trip to Enbarr.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, should we invite Claude? I feel kind of bad for him being the only Golden Deer left.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shrugged. “Should’ve joined my class when I asked then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...he’s the house leader?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Should’ve joined anyway. Then we could’ve been the Golden Lions. With antlers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...why would the lions have antlers?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To keep the deer part, duh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I'm going to ask Edelgard how big her room is,” Byleth said, getting ready to walk away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still can't believe you became a skirt chaser,” Shez huffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? But I don't hate skirts. They're swishy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the pair of sisters left, Rhea let out a slow sigh. She sat there for a few moments, before pulling out a small bag she kept on her, glad she had gotten her calming herbs when leaving the burning monastery. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Easily lighting the herbs, she sat back, doing her best to enjoy her forced retirement as calmly as she could. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…She still thought this was all Shez’s fault.</span>

  <span>“Before we begin preparations to leave, I wanted to ask a favor, Byleth,” Rhea asked, approaching the young woman while she sat by the pond. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth sighed, glancing back at the archbishop. “Please don't tell me you want to take Fhirdiad back first.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. I just wanted to visit somewhere with you. We'll be able to return before the day ends,” Rhea explained while Byleth frowned, “There might not be any benefit to seeing how it's faring, but I want to see what is happening at Zanado, and what these ‘Knights of Reclamation’ are planning.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your not the first person that’s brought that up. Shez reminded me that I wanted to go there anyway the other day,” she replied, staring out into the water where the ruined remains of the dock still floated. “We can afford to take a detour. It would probably be better to have more soldiers too, which we can get if we recruit those knights.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. You think they will join us that readily?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t see why they wouldn’t. Apparently they revere me, and most of them were Knights of Seiros before, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And the rest of them are turncoats from the army that invaded Garreg Mach,” Rhea pointed out, “While I would like to believe that they would be stalwart allies and that whatever forces of mine joined them are still loyal, I hope you can understand why I have some concerns.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess. You are kind of a pessimist when it comes to people.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I've had enough experience with people to default to pessimism.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. So, do you want to go now? If we take my wyvern we could return before dinner.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The sooner the better. We should probably inform Catherine and Dimitri before we leave though, lest a panic be caused by our disappearance.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hopefully they're on the way to the stables,” Byleth muttered, getting up and leading the way to where the mounts were kept. Though as they passed by the main gate where the market once stood, they heard a commotion, a guard shouting something she couldn't quite make out. “Hm. One moment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Byleth? What is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth ignored her, her brow furrowed as she headed towards the gates. Something in the air was raising her hackles, and before long she felt a shiver go up her spine at the smell of blood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–brought her up here as quickly as possible, now go get a healer and quickly!” Alois ordered the gate guard, who rushed to obey his command, before he paused at the sight of Byleth’s approach. “Professor, quickly, you know healing magic, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who's hurt?” Byleth asked, quickly moving over, before coming to a halt as she saw who was being carried. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In a different situation, she would have been happy to see someone from her mercenary group. However, she could feel nothing but dread when she saw Candace, blood soaked and unconscious. Arrows littered her body, and where her right arm once was, there was now a bandaged stump. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was over at her side in an instant, pressing her hands against Candace as white light glowed from her palms and flowed into the blonde’s wounds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take the arrows out as I heal her, we can’t let the wounds heal over them,” she instructed, and Alois got to work without hesitation or complaint. Candace made some faint, pained noises while Byleth worked, prompting a small grimace from the professor. “I know, I’m sorry for hurting you. I promise it will feel better soon. You’ll be okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The words were more to reassure herself than Candace, who was too out of it to even register the meaning if she could even hear them. Byleth could feel a sense of worry gnawing a pit in her stomach, familiar enough that she could recognize it immediately. If Candace, one of her father’s lieutenants, was this wounded, what did it mean for Jeralt? Were they in some kind of battle? Was he okay? If he was, why wasn’t he here? If he wasn’t…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Everything will be okay,” Byleth murmured. She wasn’t sure if she believed it.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The Academy’s infirmary had been one of the casualties of the invasion years ago, smashed to pieces by one of the falling meteors, so the church’s forces had set up a tent for any wounded out in the courtyard. That was where Shez hurried the instant she heard about Candace being brought in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She couldn't get close, since Candace was still resting, but she could see the wounded mercenary laying in bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What happened?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don't know. We were on patrol, and we saw her riding up. I don't even think she was aware of where she was or where she was going with how much blood she lost,” Alois explained, frowning deeply. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Whoever she was facing, they were using the same weapons as the Death Knight who attacked the professor way back when,” Manuela informed, hearing their conversation as she continued looking over Candace, “Which certainly didn't help with healing her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, so an Agarthan went after her?” Shez asked, frowning too, “Was she attacked? Did she get into a fight with them or what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We don’t know yet,” Alois replied, rubbing his chin with furrowed brows, “If I had to guess, from where the arrows hit her, she was fleeing a group of attackers, perhaps seeking aid from her allies?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So…wait, was she already close? Because if she wound up here, then she had to be in riding distance or she would’ve died from her wounds, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That seems likely…given where we met her on our patrol, it's likely she was coming from somewhere north of the monastery, so perhaps she was fighting someone in the kingdom?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would she be in the Kingdom? Last I heard, Jeralt was in the Empire.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can figure that out later. What matters is making sure she's okay,” Manuela said as she let out a huff, “Speaking of, where is the professor?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rhea took her somewhere, said it would help take her mind off things,” Shez replied as she huffed as well, her arms crossed over her chest, “It's probably for the best that she is keeping busy.” Then a thought occurred. “Actually, hang on…where’d she actually take her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Er…wouldn’t you know that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She didn’t mention…shit, wait, I think they were going north.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I wonder if they went to Zanado?” Alois commented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez stared at him, then promptly warped away, traveling northward as quickly as possible while muttering as many curses as she could think of towards the stupid archbishop who seemed to absolutely refuse to leave well enough alone. Then those curses got a great deal louder when she heard roaring in the distance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Red Canyon of Zanado was named as such for the tale of a slaughter that took place within it over a millennia ago, where blood flowed so heavily that the very stones turned red. Now, the Red Canyon was dyed crimson once more as humans and beasts alike bled in ruby rivers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He was here,” Arval muttered in Shez’s mind, making her stiffen as she stood at the cliff edge overlooking the canyon, “Your so-called twin…and there, there’s your sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez looked where he pointed and scowled at the sight of some massive monsters trying to eat her sister. Trying and failing, luckily, as Byleth moved quickly and carved deep wounds in their dark flesh, all while using light magic to hold off any that tried to take advantage while she was fighting. She was still very outnumbered though, so of course it was up to Shez to even the odds by warping up above one of the bigger beasts and letting gravity add some momentum as she swung straight down with both her swords.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Demonic beasts had tough hides at the best of times, to the point that Shez was pretty sure they had some kind of magic barrier that needed to be broken before they could actually be hurt. Luckily for her though, these weren’t fresh beasts set up to guard a castle; most of them were already bloodied and torn up by the knights they’d been trying to kill, to the point that she could see spears and arrows impaling those thick scales of theirs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All that to say, when she swung, she cut </span>
  <em>
    <span>deep</span>
  </em>
  <span> into the beast’s neck, splitting through muscle, sinew, and even bone as its pained roars cut off without another sound.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s one for me,” she said, sparing a grin at Byleth before she let the magic of her awakened form flow through her body and sprinted into the fray.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t see it, but she would be very amused to know her sister gave her an annoyed frown and a quiet “Hmph.” before running in to join her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though Shez was actually way more focused on fighting off the monsters than playing along with the silly competition she started, especially since there still seemed to be people in the canyon that needed help judging by the sounds of fighting up ahead. And one of those people happened to be Rhea, who was currently attempting to ward off a winged, white beast with a spear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There you are! What were you thinking bringing Byleth here!?” Shez shouted as she slashed at the strangely colored beast. Letting out a pained roar, the creature tried to slam its hind claws down on her, but she easily flashed back out of range. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don't hurt them!” Rhea shouted, looking over more panicked than she did a moment ago. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?? Why wouldn't I!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'll explain as soon as we subdue them!” Rhea shouted back, before dodging a tail strike from the beast. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–And how the hell are we gonna do that!?” Shez yelled, warping away as the white beast tried to blast her with a beam of light from its mouth, “We can’t exactly pin down the regular demonic beasts, how are we supposed to deal with this thing?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, but we can’t kill them! Please, child!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked at the actual desperation in Rhea’s voice, then sighed and glanced at Arval. “You got anything?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…subduing an enemy combatant–No, subduing a monster…” they murmured, thinking, before Shez felt a sudden rush of symbols in her brain. “Something like that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah…we’re gonna need to figure out how many things I actually know how to do now,” Shez decided, because between her mom’s notes and Epimenides’s lingering knowledge, it felt like she was in genuine danger of becoming some kind of super intelligent mage person, and it would be way too weird for her to suddenly switch up her entire style like that. Though maybe Lysithea would like it? She’d probably be into all sorts of magic stuff–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Focus,” Arval spoke up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, focusing.” Shez took a breath, then promptly warped on top of the white beast’s head, in between its huge horns. She felt it buck beneath her, the monster immediately detecting the weight on its head and trying to fight her off, only for her to press her hand against its head, directly on the strange flesh of its body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Where regular demonic beasts had thick, leathery hides that reminded Shez of tightly bound bandages up close, the white beast looked like its body was made up of vines, thickly corded into a vaguely wyvern-ish shape. The comparison continued with how these big things had wings instead of forelegs, which would make the next part trickier, but Shez was nothing if not willing to adapt to tricky circumstances.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So with one hand pressed to the beast’s head, she spoke one simple word. “Tartarus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And in an instant, the monster’s body went rigid, its limbs locking up as it suddenly crashed to the ground. The beast twitched and its wings flared, the momentary robbery of its limb control fading in an instant as the divine magic coursing through it pushed out the darkness that sought to bring it low, only for Rhea to suddenly place her own hand against the beast’s head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am not your foe,” she stated, her eyes sad as the beast beneath her stilled, its empty eyes unfocused. The beast seemed to no longer struggle, letting Shez drop the spell she was holding. With its new freedom, the beast looked around, as if unaware of where it was. “It's okay. You will be okay once more.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When everything here gets settled, you better tell us everything. You're not getting out of this, got it?” Shez stated, staring at Rhea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Of course,” Rhea replied, sounding far too tired. Shaking her head to clear some of that exhaustion, she looked around. “Where is Byleth? We were separated.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, she’s somewhere around here, probably saving people and healing the wounded,” Shez replied, before pausing as a demonic beast’s head abruptly landed on the ground nearby, its tongue hanging out of its bloodied mouth. “...or she’s carving through all the monsters around. Oh, actually, one sec!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez warped away from Rhea, glancing around the battlefield for a moment before she spotted her sister leaping up and splitting a flying beast straight in half. She whistled, impressed, before cupping her hands around her mouth to project her voice. “HEY BY! RHEA SAYS NOT TO KILL THE WHITE ONES! SHE HAS SOME KIND OF THING WITH THEM!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“UNDERSTOOD!” her sister shouted back, immediately turning to strike at the next nearest beast, “HOW MANY ARE THERE?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, good question. Rhea, how many are there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…potentially five to seven, though there may be more if the mutation has a different factor to it than I presume.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, that might make this tricky…any chance you know of a handy way to help take them down easily?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea sighed. “Shez, it isn’t going to be that convenient–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agarthan sorcery detected.” Then both of them paused as a large, golden golem with a lion on its chest poked its head up from where it had been lying, seemingly broken, on the ground and turned its gaze straight towards Shez. “Priority One: Extermination of demons set to Priority Two. New Priority One Established: Elimination of Agarthan Sorcerer–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, wait a sec, I know you!” Shez interrupted, her brief confusion turning to elation once she recognized the ‘giant lion lady’, “Marcelle! Hey, how’s it been?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The golem actually paused in the middle of pushing itself up. “...Priority One set to Primary Directive: Eliminate Agarthan–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no, do not set that as your directive!” Rhea interrupted, putting a hand on Shez’s shoulder and moving her out of the way. Or, to be more exact, shoving her off her feet. “Marcelle, Shez is not an enemy, she’s on our side!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could’ve told her that without shoving me,” Shez grumbled as she got up from the ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mark her as an ally and do not take any steps to harm her! Understood?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Authority Recognized. Response Formulated: Greetings, Saint Seiros. Directive Requested.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea sighed in some relief, before fixing the golden golem with a serious gaze. “Relay the following instructions to all the other golems present within Zanado. The chief priority for our forces is to keep the remaining humans within the canyon safe. The entities called demonic beasts should be eliminated with all due haste, but it is a secondary priority to keeping the people here, humans and nabateans, safe from these monsters. And along with that, I want all of you to avoid engaging with the white, wyvern-like beasts. They need to be subdued nonlethally.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Instructions received, new directives established, new objectives established. Parameters set.” The golem immediately turned around, steam releasing from its body in large plumes before it launched a beam of light that blasted one of the flying beasts out of the sky.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh wow. How the hell did these guys lose with these ladies helping them out?” Shez wondered, glancing at Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They might be strong, but they can still be overwhelmed,” Rhea stated, taking a moment to catch her breath, “That and they tend to have one track minds. They wouldn’t have dealt well with a sudden ambush, which is what this disaster seems to have been.“ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I guess that makes sense. These guys wouldn’t have known how to deal with…” Shez trailed off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? What is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…h-hang on.” Shez mumbled, before heading over towards a body on the ground. Something about the rough, dull leather of his clothes caught her attention amidst all the bloodied whites and blues, and she felt a lump form in her throat when she recognized the bald head and bearded face, marred by what looked like a blade cleaving straight through it. “...ah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took a small breath, then crouched beside Victor’s body. It’d been years since she’d seen the rowdy mercenary with a bald head and big belly, his rough features almost always graced by a grin for one dumb reason or another. Usually because of some argument he thought he won with Ezra.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Judging by the dried blood and the flies buzzing around, he’d been killed maybe a day ago. Maybe less. Too late to help him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...is he someone you knew?” Rhea asked, her voice somber as she looked over Shez’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. He’s the guy who taught me how to play cards. Uncle Victor.” She took another breath, shakier this time. “I thought…I knew things could’ve gone bad, but I thought…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You never believed the next time you would see him, he would be dead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Yeah…hm. This was done by a blade, not a beast. The arrows in Candace would make sense if they had archers at a distance, but someone getting up this close while a bunch of demonic beasts were rampaging has to be a ballsy bastard…” Shaking her head, she looked off towards where Byleth was finishing off another beast. “...Can you keep an eye on him for a moment? I…I need to make sure Byleth is prepared for this.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, child.” Rhea nodded to Shez and watched while she left, before letting out a sigh as she turned back towards the bloodied canyon. Not for the first time, she began to wonder if her former homeland had become a cursed place, rather than a blessed one. To see it become the site of another massacre…it hurt. It truly, truly did.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The white beast that had once been one of her loyal cardinals let out a soft, mournful noise as it lowered its snout to her, reacting to her sorrow. She returned its sympathy with a sad sigh of her own, before petting the beast as best she could, its thorny surface making it difficult to get close without injury.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She could accept some injury though, if it meant providing comfort to one of the few who had stood by her for so very long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I swear, I will avenge you,” Rhea stated, ignoring the way the thorns pricked and cut at her hand, “You and all others who died in this place. I will find whoever did this…and I will end them.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The Principality of Hrym. A name that carried with it a sting of betrayal and grudges harkening back decades, centuries, and millennia. A bloodied land of mountains and wetlands, its place between the Airmid River and Pearl Sea made it at once both valuable to hold onto, yet almost impossible to cultivate properly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Centuries had been spent attempting to make something of worth in these sodden lands that had once traded hands between several different houses. Once upon a time, it had even belonged to the vaunted House Ordelia, though the formation of the Alliance ensured it would never belong to them again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Empire could not stand to have traitors within its borders, after all, and so the land became Hrym, named for the viscomital house that took ownership of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, House Hrym never knew the true reason for why every venture to make something of their land failed miserably. Forts sinking into the marshes as they were built, mines collapsing before anything of worth could be found, miseries and tragedies alike, all chalked up to the seeming reality that the environment was simply unsuitable for any true ambitions, and not to sabotage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No one ever truly considered that there would be those lurking deep in the dark that saw this land as theirs, and were ruthless in ruining any who came close to taking it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now though, those who once slithered deep below stood tall and arrogant, displaying for one and all the proud cruelty of the Agarthan people.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dear goddess, what is that monstrosity?!” questioned Archduke Ludwig von Aegir, the nominal leader of the principality, as he stared down from the balcony overlooking Castle Hrym’s courtyard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t it obvious? It’s our new weapon,” answered his nominal advisor, the sage called Myson, whose bearded face held a truly vile smile as he rested his hands on the balcony’s railing, “Meet the Typhon, your grace. Or as you may prefer to call it, a giant demonic beast.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig gripped the railing, squeezing down on the stone in an attempt to steady his nerves. The monster down in the courtyard truly was gigantic, far larger than any of the beasts his “advisor” had crafted before. Its body was a mix of fat and bulky, its black, bandage-patterned flesh bulging beneath the chains that held it down while figures in black clothes and bird masks examined its hulking physique. “...are those </span>
  <em>
    <span>eyes</span>
  </em>
  <span> on its throat?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my, you have some truly impressive eyes of your own to notice that detail, Ludwig,” Myson praised, sounding surprisingly genuine, “Yes, it seems to be a way for the Typhon to compensate for its otherwise limited field of vision. Unlike the quadrupedal Ladon, the Typhon is bipedal, so the eyes will allow it to notice anything that might get too close beneath it. Clever, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...that thing can walk on two legs?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. You can, after all.” Ludwig gave him an incredulous look there, but Myson paid no attention, his shadowed eyes still on the beast. “The important part is getting it outfitted properly. A proper helm and some gauntlets will make it all the more formidable, and to a far greater degree than its cousins. Doesn’t it just make you want to test it out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Honestly, Ludwig would prefer to never have to see a beast like this one ever again, but he felt like that would be the wrong answer here. Especially since Myson actually turned to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you know of any close villages that aren’t necessary for our cause? I would prefer we do not destroy anything vital during the testing phase.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig couldn’t immediately come up with an answer for that question, in large part because any unnecessary villages had already been used up for the Agarthan’s testing over the past few years. And while he wasn’t one of those bleeding hearts that would argue for the nonexistent value of </span>
  <em>
    <span>peasant</span>
  </em>
  <span> lives, even he could piece together that they were really cutting into Hrym’s labor force with all of these experiments.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thankfully for him, he was saved from having to bring that up thanks to the arrival of an Agarthan warlock. “Lord Myson, the Liberator, Lord Dolofonos, and Lady Bias have arrived to give their reports.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, excellent, I was wondering how things were going. Come along, Ludwig. You may as well hear how the war is going.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig grimaced at the Agarthan’s irreverence. He was the archduke of the principality, and yet this lunatic treated him more like a pet than an ally! It was Ludwig von Aegir that gave this endeavor even the slightest hint of legitimacy, and yet everyone here looked down on him! It was infuriating!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He still followed after Myson though, trailing only slightly behind him as the mad mage led the way to the castle’s war room. It wouldn’t do to be uninformed about his so-called allies' insane schemes. He might not be able to control the Agarthans like he once did, but Ludwig could hopefully curb their worst instincts so he’d actually have a nation to rule by the time this war was over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The treasonous duke felt himself tense once he entered the lounge, his shoulders bunching up at the sight of the worst of the Agarthans he was forced to interact with. Fortunately for him, Bias didn’t bother looking at him, instead keeping her eyes on some type of warped crest stone in her hand. It was for the best; he could still smell the burning flesh from the last time the witch had “assisted” his forces.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately for him, another one of the worst did notice him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Greetings, Lord Myson and Duke Ludwig,” Dolofonos greeted, standing and bowing to his superior before nodding to Ludwig. For some reason, the deranged assassin thought the two of them were friends after he’d set Ludwig free from his cell those years ago and Ludwig…well, he wasn’t about to correct the man in case it somehow constituted an offense warranting execution. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’d seen what the “Blood Sage” could do with those knives when he was in a foul mood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Archduke, remember?” Myson corrected as he moved over to sit in the chair at the “head” of the lounge table, “Our beloved ally is independent from the Hegemon and we need to keep that in mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I intended no offense, Archduke Ludwig.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took Ludwig a moment to notice the lunatic’s gaze was expectant. “...ah, yes, no offense taken, Sir Dolofonos.” Then, to be polite, he continued. “How did your…mission go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, thank you for asking.” He reached into a pouch at his side and drew a black flute that made Ludwig’s skin crawl to look at it. “The ‘Demon’s Lure’ proved effective at corralling the ladons and delphons, though it seems to have a deleterious effect on them overall. They appeared to be even more berserk than usual and they failed to follow any further commands after being unleashed into the enemy encampment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Interesting,” Myson mused, stroking his beard thoughtfully, “Not a complete success then…to be clear, those church remnants were still wiped out, correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Lord Myson. Though our younger operative nearly let one get away,” Dolofonos stated with a small frown towards the masked Agarthan seated beside him, who chuckled at the chiding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, sorry about that. It wasn’t that bad though, right? I got the beast’s arm, and you had those archers head after her, so odds are, she’s dead anyway,” the young man said with a careless amusement that Ludwig was surprised to see. Most Agarthans, while arrogant and dismissive in general, were very deferential to their superiors, from what he’d seen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now if only they considered Ludwig a proper superior, as they should, and not just some pet of their masters…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The escapee is likely dead, yes, but she shouldn’t have come close to escaping to begin with,” Dolofonos chided, before looking back at Myson, “Not only that, but the operative failed in his mission to secure the monastery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey now, don’t say it like that,” the young man complained, “I had the monastery plenty secure! It's not my fault the beasts I were given were incompetent.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, my apologies for that, I'm afraid we've had our hands quite full here,” Myson responded, as he examined his creation, “I must say, you don't seem to put off about it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I did have quite an interesting fight. Though before I talk about that,” He glanced over to Bias with a pout, “Why didn't you tell me she could also stop time?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me?” The Agarthan responded, looking up from the warped crest stone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, the Fell Star. You told me about her time reversal, not her time stop.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I was unaware she could do such a thing,” Bias stated, a frown evident through her veil. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? I must say, it's quite interesting that you don't sound surprised to hear she's alive, Bias,” Myson remarked, regarding his subordinate with an inscrutable expression, “Is there any reason why you didn’t report the Fell Star’s survival immediately to our forces?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was busy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. With what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Figuring out some things that relate to my personal project. You remember the enhancements you gave Kyrie, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, so that’s her heart then,” Myson noted, ignoring the way Ludwig grimaced at that piece of information, “I was wondering. May I have a look?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias tossed the stone–the heart–to him with a disturbing casualness. “Careful there. You wouldn’t want to break the poor thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I’ll be careful…you should have reported the Fell Star’s return.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No need to chide me. You know now, so is it really a problem?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. I must admit, Bias. I am beginning to doubt your commitment to our cause. Letting Kyrie die, failing to report the Fell Star’s return…there’s not much incentive for me to uphold my end of our deal if you aren’t upholding yours.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You wanted my service, I’m serving you properly,” Bias bit out, her anger growing. Ludwig winced to see the upholstery beginning to smolder beneath her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you really? Why is the Fell Star causing us problems then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because her bitch of a sister is hanging around too! In case you didn’t notice, it’s hard enough dealing with one of them, but both at once is bullshit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey now, there’s no need to be mean, Lady Bias,” the young man complained, “That’s my sister you’re talking about too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh don’t give me that!” she snapped, pointing at the masked man, “You can’t tell me your ‘papa’ really managed to make a functional, adult clone in less than a fucking year! Either he’s taking credit for something that already existed, or there’s more to you than you’re saying, you damn mutant.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy just laughed at that. “Ah, you’re always so harsh, Lady Bias. But I like that about you.” He chuckled, before looking at Myson. “Hey, Papa Myson, you mind letting her off this time? I got a nice test of my own abilities out of those two showing up, and who really cares if they took the monastery?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, what?” Ludwig interrupted, a look of alarm crossing his face, “You let the enemy retake the monastery!? Do you realize how dangerous that is?! Now they have a rallying point right in the center of Fodlan!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” The boy tilted his head, the action disturbingly birdlike given his mask. “...who’re you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–How do you not know who I am?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I introduced Duke Ludwig earlier,” Dolofonos stated, giving his younger comrade an unimpressed look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Archduke,” Myson reminded as though it were an afterthought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, he's one of those beasts you're keeping around? Hm, he doesn't like he'd be useful for much though…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now, now, there's no need to be rude to him. He is still our ally, isn't that right, Archduke?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig grimaced, but nodded. It rankled at his pride to be so obedient to these…creatures, but he hadn’t gotten where he was in life by being a fool. One way or another, he was going to survive the Agarthans’ machinations and Edelgard’s fury, and find a way to come out on top!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Excellent. Sit by Bias, if you would.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>…eh?</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Er, what was that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson glanced at him. “There’s an open spot next to her. It would be awkward if you were standing this entire time, wouldn’t it? So go ahead, sit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...ah, well, there's no need to worry about my comfort! I am perfectly capable of standing for this meeting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I insist.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And so, he sat, trying his best to ignore the uncomfortable amounts of heat he could feel coming off the seething woman beside him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now then, why don’t we discuss our next steps?” Myson decided, turning back to the group while rolling the stone around in his hand, “Bias, you seem to need some positive feedback to actually do your job properly, so I’ll thank you for bringing this stone back and use the information it grants me to progress with your reward. In exchange…Ludwig, name a city we would want burned.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig paused. “...an entire city?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did say that, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You did, Papa Myson!” agreed the strange boy, prompting a nod from Myson.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As I thought. You see, the issue in front of us, Ludwig, is that we’ve enjoyed our stalemate with the hegemon for some years now. She attempts to make progress, we push her back, so on, so forth. But if she has the Fell Star and the Failed Vessel to tip the scales in her favor, then we need to make appropriate steps to ensure she can’t break this deadlock of ours. And while my predecessor may have had more options for causing mass destruction, I have found that Bias makes for a decent enough substitute.” He grinned. “Thales never managed to burn the monastery, after all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…see,” Ludwig responded, his mind racing, “Couldn’t we direct Lady Bias towards the monastery then? That is where our enemies are gathering.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I would prefer not to risk her on something like that. There’s too high a chance she would let her grudge get the better of her and die stupidly to the Fell Star.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m right here,” Bias groused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know, and I’m not wrong. You know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She grunted, but said nothing more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just think about it, Ludwig. I’ll be back to you in a moment,” Myson stated, before looking at his subordinates. “Dolofonos, we’ll want to deal with the hegemon sooner rather than later now. Going after her directly is going to be a risk and while I am loath to waste all those years of work, removing her from play is a better move than letting her continue to lead the enemy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I understand, Lord Myson,” Dolofonos said, bowing his head, “She’ll be dealt with immediately.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, that really does feel like a waste,” the masked man complained, sinking back in his seat with his arms crossed over his chest, “Are you sure we can’t find some way to use her better than just killing her off? Maybe brainwash her or something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thales had some ideas on that subject,” Myson noted, “They were all remarkably stupid though. Very poorly thought out.” He tilted his head, thinking. “Hm…the best idea that could work would ultimately reduce her to a rampaging beast, but by that point, she’d be more useful dead anyway. Our best case scenario would be retrieving her corpse for further use.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine, fine, I get it.” The boy leaned forward with sudden, obvious eagerness. “So do I get to go along for this, Papa Myson?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…why not? You do need more field experience, and I would like to see how you measure up to our previous project. You have my permission to kill her, Sigma.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, that reminds me. I decided on a new name.” The boy lifted his mask, showing off a grinning face. “Call me Shax.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s an awful name,” Bias bluntly stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw, come on Lady Bias! I thought it was good!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because you’re a stupid brat.” She glanced at Myson. “Why not just send me with these two? Burning down the Imperial Army would be just as good as destroying some random city.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it wouldn’t be. I want this attack to be two-pronged, Bias. What is it worth to me if you kill a thousand soldiers who have already lost the head leading them? No, I want to make the remaining beasts submit. I want to remind them that they live and die at our leisure.” His grin grew into a bloodthirsty smile, and Ludwig felt himself shiver at the sight of the mad cruelty in the warlock’s yellow eyes. “So then, Ludwig, my dear friend…I hope you have an appropriate target in mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The archduke shifted in his seat and tugged at his collar, trying to cool himself down. He could feel sweat starting to soak into his clothes and he wasn’t sure if it was just because of the heat. “I, ah…w-well, I, er, imagine…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about the capital?” Dolofonos proposed when Ludwig trailed off, “Our territory here is essentially the capital of the Principality, and we do not need two capitals.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not a bad idea, but one that runs the risk of running into trouble,” Myson pointed out, “Edelgard will be by the capital, after all, and if we try to have her killed while also having Enbarr burned, the two missions may conflict with one another. No, I would prefer a target that holds value, but will be…</span>
  <em>
    <span>softer.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Easier to ruin.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not a necessary target then,” Bias remarked, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it might actually be better if the strategic importance was minimal. We’re looking for an act of cruelty, not pragmatism. And besides, we’re already going to be destroying the Bridge of Myrddin.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Hold on a moment, what was that?” Ludwig asked, paling despite the heat. “You–The Bridge of Myrddin is one of our most important routes to the Alliance–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And with Ordelia territory taken from us, all it presents is an avenue for attack from the north,” Myson countered, “I don’t need trade partners, Ludwig. Any asset we can’t use is a liability. You would do well to understand that. Now name a city, or we’ll have to see if Boramas will suffice as a new testing ground.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig flinched at the suggestion. The idea of burning his own home city–or worse, leaving it to this madman’s machinations–made him recoil. He already knew Myson wouldn’t accept an argument, the man clearly wanted to destroy a city purely for the sake of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So, with a heavier heart than he expected, he took a breath, and in one word condemned thousands to a painful death. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It’s your own fault, Hevring. You should have stayed loyal, you damned fool.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Mozghuz.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson chuckled. “Mozghuz then.” He turned his gaze towards Bias. “You heard him, Bias.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Burn it to the ground.”</span>

  <span>Byleth was quiet on the way back to the monastery. It kind of reminded Shez of those early years when she first joined up with Jeralt’s Mercenaries, when her future sister barely talked or emoted at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though, that wasn’t quite accurate. This time, Byleth’s eyes were red from tears, and she sniffled when Shez gave her a hug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You gonna be okay?” Shez asked, checking her over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah…I will be. I didn’t think…I thought everyone would be okay.” She took a shaky breath. “...m-maybe if I go back–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We don’t know when he died, By. It looked like it’d been more than a day and you know that’s your limit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Still, maybe if we went together, we could make it in time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It hurt to hear her sound hopeful. She’d probably come up with a dozen arguments for how they could have done something to help if Shez let her, so instead Shez just gave her sister a hug. “It’s not your fault.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth returned the hug, squeezing her tightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a moment, once she felt Byleth start to pull away, Shez pulled back. “Alright, you visit Candace, I’ll handle all the planning stuff. You leave it to your big sister, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you’re younger than me,” Byleth pointed out, unimpressed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But I’m still taller,” Shez retorted, grinning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine, you're the baby big sister.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m willing to accept that because it means I win. Also, never call me that in front of any of our friends.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I disrespectfully decline because I know you’ll call me the tiny older sister the first chance you get.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm. Well I probably wouldn’t have because I didn’t think of that until you said it, oh tiny elderly one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth squinted at her sister. Shez returned the “glare” with a fierce one of her own, though she couldn’t stop herself from grinning, at least a little bit. Then the somber mood hit them again and they both slumped with a small sense of guilt at feeling cheerful after a tragedy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just…tell Candace I say hi if she wakes up while you’re there,” Shez requested, earning a nod and then another hug from Byleth, before the elder of the Eisners peeled away from her younger sister and headed over to the infirmary tent while Shez went over to Rhea’s impromptu war room, which was currently set up in the courtyard in between the classrooms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was mostly just a fancy table with a map and some chairs, plus an overhang to keep the weather from messing anything up. Not that fancy, but it was the best they had while the monastery was being cleared out and fixed up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez,” Dimitri greeted at her approach, nodding solemnly to her, “You have my condolences for your uncle’s death. I did not realize Captain Jeralt had a brother among his forces, but I am sure you were close–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s not my dad’s brother,” Shez replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. I see, I didn’t realize your mother–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Honorary uncle, Dimitri.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, of course. I imagine Lady Rhea would have mentioned it if she had a son.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...yeah, probably,” she responded, trying to follow the prince’s logic.</span>
  <em>
    <span> Does he think Missus Sitri is my mom, or does he think my mom is Rhea’s daughter? Either way, I think he forgot Byleth and I aren’t blood related…eh, whatever.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “So, what’s everyone over here thinking about? Still arguing about whether you’re gonna go north or south?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We need to figure out our next course of action,” Catherine stated, frowning, “The attack on the knights in the canyon is proof we can’t just keep waiting around. Our enemy isn’t about to just sit back and let us do whatever we want without responding.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, okay, I get that. So we should go to the Empire first since there’s active fighting going on down there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That earned frowns from all the Faerghans around the table, aside from Yuri who let out an amused noise. “You would think, but his highness disagrees.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look, I get that, but we just found someone close to us dead and another near death,” Shez pointed out, “Even if you guys end up agreeing to head to the Kingdom, there's no way Byleth is risking staying away from our dad and her class any longer.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I understand that, but we must take the greater scope into consideration,” Dimitri argued, “As it stands, the Empire hasn't fallen to the rebelling forces while the Kingdom is in much more dire straits.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “...alright, fuck it, how about this? Me, Byleth, and whoever else wants to go are going to the Empire to fix the problems there, and you guys can keep doing what you were doing before, just with more back up. You’ve managed to last three years like this, you can wait a couple months for us to clean up the Empire.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I doubt it will take only a few months–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah and how long is it going to take to beat your asshole uncle, huh? We’re not going to the kingdom while our dad is in danger, that’s it. The rest of this shit, you guys can figure it out, but Byleth and me are going to meet up with our dad and then we’re going to fix the Empire. End of discussion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well we could try to discuss it further,” Yuri offered, a small smile playing on his face as he raised his hands in surrender at Shez’s immediate glare, “Alright, alright, no need to get testy with us. You have your priorities and we have ours. I just think you should carefully consider what will do the most good for the most people. Don’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez frowned, then actually considered the suggestion. “The most good…oh shit, you’re right!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh goodie. Care to tell me what I’m right about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Sword of the Creator! That’ll be the best weapon to have for taking down all our enemies! I gotta go grab that thing!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, what–” Dimitri began right before Shez warped away without another word, the mercenary already completely set on her completely sensible new plan.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Byleth pushed her way into the infirmary tent with a small frown, one that deepened when she saw Candace still sleeping steadily in bed. The blonde mercenary looked peaceful while she rested, but the bandages covering her body were more than enough evidence of how close she’d come to dying. How close she’d </span>
  <em>
    <span>also</span>
  </em>
  <span> come to dying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hello Byleth,” Manuela greeted with a smile by Candace’s bedside, though it faltered once she saw her fellow professor’s expression, “What’s wrong? Do we have someone else that needs medical attention, or…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. Sorry. It’s too late for that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Oh, I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Thank you. It’s…I feel like I should do something more. That maybe, if I just went back–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You shouldn’t think like that,” Manuela chided, frowning, “We can’t change the past.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I can,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Byleth thought but didn’t say. Shez wasn’t wrong though, the chances that she could go back and get there in time to save Victor were nonexistent at this point. It felt…wrong not to try though. She’d already used the divine pulse a few times, mostly in that fight with Shax, but if she pushed things–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, don’t get lost in your own head over there,” Manuela said, drawing Byleth’s attention back to her, “Hm…why don’t you sit? I’m sure your friend would appreciate the company.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...okay.” And with that, Byleth sat by Candace’s bedside. She wasn’t sure what she was supposed to do in this situation. Maybe just wait? But waiting led to her eyes lingering on Candace’s injuries, and she couldn’t help but stare at the stump where the blonde’s arm once was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry to say it, but I think my career as a musician is over before it began…” came a raspy voice that made Byleth immediately straighten, her eyes going wide as she looked right at Candace. The blonde smiled over at her captain’s kid, her eyes half open and heavy with exhaustion. “Mornin’ Byleth…you look like somebody died.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...that’s a terrible joke, Candace.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm, yeah, I figured.” She sighed, laying back on her pillows and staring up at the ceiling. “Victor didn’t make it then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, it happens. It’s a shame though, I liked the big lug. Spent a lotta years together.” She glanced at Byleth. “How’re you holdin’ up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…feel bad about it. I feel like I could do…something and I could fix it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nah, you probably couldn’t. There were a lot of beasts there, and then that weird guy that said he was Shez’s brother–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth went still. “What? You saw Shax?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s his name? That’s weird. Sounds a lot like Shez but if it was written wrong. Or…said wrong?” Candace shrugged. “One or the other. Victor tried to hold him back. Betcha anything that the son of a bitch was the one who killed Vic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth felt her hands clench into fists, her knuckles popping as her anger rose. “Shax killed Victor. He…Did he say anything? Anything at all?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He was asking about the captain.” Candace scowled. “I bet anything the prick thinks he can take Jeralt on. Little shit is gonna have another thing com–” Then she abruptly sat up, her eyes going wide.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stiffened. “Candace? C-Candace, are you okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The dirty-blonde lancer turned to her, her eyes still wide with alarm. “Holy hell, Byleth, when did you get here?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Candace reached out, grabbing the younger mercenary by the shoulder and staring into her eyes as a startled laugh slipped out of her mouth. “Saints and Seiros, you’re here! You’re here, you’re alive, you’re actually–” Then she was suddenly hugging Byleth, her one arm wrapping tightly around her. “Goddess, I thought–I don’t know what I thought, I just…I’m so glad you’re okay, kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked, bewildered at first, before a small laugh slipped out, half incredulous and half overwhelmed, filled with more emotion than she knew what to do with. “C-Candace…did you only just now realize who I am?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, sorry, my thoughts were all over the place there. I really just…it made perfect sense you were here, and I felt so bad about Victor, but then…then you’re actually here. You’re actually here and alive and fine–” She pulled back, immediately starting to check over the younger woman. “You are fine, right? No wounds? No diseases? No surprise pregnancy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How in the world would that last one be something I need to worry about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You never know! That’s why it’d be a surprise!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth couldn’t help but giggle. She put her hands on Candace’s shoulders, lightly pushing the older woman back. “I’m fine, Candace. I promise. You’re the one I should be worried about. You’re missing an arm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, that.” Candace glanced down at the stump where her arm once was. “Huh. That’s gonna make mercenary work harder.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Candace, I think that's the least of your worries right now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I don't think so. I mean, how else am I supposed to get paid?” She paused again. “Hang on, you have green hair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I also have green eyes,” Byleth agreed, nodding. “And don’t worry, I’ll make sure you have more than enough money to live comfortably after the war ends.” She rubbed her chin thoughtfully. “Hm…maybe you could be the new stable master?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh…yeah, that would be nice! I wouldn’t mind taking care of horses after all this is over. Or now, I guess, since I don’t think I’m gonna be fighting anymore…shit. I don’t think I can fight anymore. I…well, maybe? You kinda need two arms to use a lance, but maybe…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t think about that right now,” Byleth requested, trying to get the blonde to focus on her again, “You need to focus on recovering. Everything else can come after that. You’re family, so of course we’re going to take care of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw…that’s really sweet, kid.” Candace smiled, before pressing her head against Byleth’s. “I’m glad you’re okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. I’m really happy you’re alive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then I’ll make sure to stay that way.” She sighed, smiling. “It’s so strange talkin’ to you now. You’re smilin’, you’re chattin’, you’re just…you’re so different from that little quiet kid that toddled after the captain. I still see her in you sometimes, but you’ve really grown up.” Tears started to prick at her eyes as she laughed. “Ah, listen to me, soundin’ like an old lady…I’m so sorry Vic didn’t get to see you like this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I’m sorry I wasn’t here–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, nope, no apologies from you,” Candace insisted, ruffling Byleth’s hair, “You might be an adult now, but you’re still a kid to me and Vic, and that means we gotta help you, not the other way around. And I’d be more than happy if you outlived me more than a dozen times over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth gave her another hug, squeezing her tightly. “...thank you for buying me clothes. I ripped my tights. Sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Candace blinked. “You did? Dang, those were nice tights…hm, shit, gonna need to see if Anna’s around, maybe get a new pair–Hang on, were your ears always pointy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused, not expecting the older woman to notice her other new change. “...not exactly. I fused with Sothis and now I think I might be a dragon person of some type.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. I have no idea what that means. You got wings?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…don’t think so? At least, I haven’t managed to turn into a dragon like Rhea can, so I’m not sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rhea can turn into a dragon?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm hm. It’s an interesting ability, but it lets her cheat in fights.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Does she cheat a lot?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded. “Constantly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh, would’ve figured an archbishop would play more fair…eh, I can respect it. So, tell me, what else have you been up to? Do you know how Shez is doing? And how’d you get your eye back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth smiled, then settled in to begin answering all of the blonde’s questions. She still had her worries, especially about her father now that she knew Shax might be after him, but in the moment, she was content to just talk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once she was sure Candace really would be fine though, she wasn’t about to let anything stop her from getting to Edelgard’s side as quickly as possible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was going to make sure everyone she loved would be safe. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Sometime later, Byleth joined back up with Rhea and Dimitri in the war tent, though she wasn’t discussing future plans so much as directing an incredulous gaze towards the latter. “Shez went </span>
  <em>
    <span>where</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To find the Sword of the Creator, professor,” the prince explained, “Apparently she hid it somewhere–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“On top of a mountain, yes, she told me. And you let her go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dimitri frowned. “I couldn’t exactly stop her, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Still. You know she’s bad with directions, I don’t want her to get lost–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey By!” Shez greeted as she abruptly appeared right beside her sister, a very familiar hollow sword in her hands that she promptly handed to Byleth, “Here you go, got your spine sword back!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...oh. Thank you, Shez,” Byleth accepted, ignoring Dimitri’s baffled look and Rhea’s exasperated sigh, “You shouldn’t run off like that though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I know, I warped away before I really thought about it. It’s a shame too, I had this thought in my brain about bringing you up there and having you pull the sword out all dramatically, with lightning flashing in the distance and all that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That sounds dangerous. Lightning tends to strike metal, especially in high vantage points.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...eh, we’d live.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold on, Shez, since when can you warp all the way from the monastery to the…which mountains did you go to?” Dimitri asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…Oghma Mountains, I think?” Shez considered, frowning, “No, wait, are we in the Oghma Mountains…it was definitely an Oghma mountain, I know that much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s still a remarkable distance to be able to warp. The spell normally has much greater limitations and while I know you have your own special version, I could have sworn you couldn’t go that far with it,” he pointed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah, I guess? I kinda warped all over the place while I was wandering around Fodlan all those years, so I guess I just got better at it,” Shez said with a shrug, before turning to Rhea, “So, hey, are we still sticking to the ‘going to the Empire’ plan, or do you wanna drag Byleth on another trip?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I do not intend to ‘drag’ the professor anywhere at this point,” Rhea stated with a small frown on her face, “However, I may not be able to accompany you as planned. While I do agree that we should make haste to the Empire, the fact that my cardinals have been transformed into…draconic beings means that I cannot leave the monastery just yet. Not while they need me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It's for the best that you stay here,” Byleth agreed, “While Dimitri needs help in the Kingdom as well, it's important we keep a central base secured. Though you'll be able to use most of our forces from the Alliance to aid you, Dimitri.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The prince looked a little bit more relieved to hear that. “Thank you, professor. It’s been difficult maintaining the few victories we do win in the Kingdom. We just didn’t have the manpower to secure the territories we managed to take, so with an influx of troops we might actually be able to reclaim Charon before the end of the month.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Good. Just be careful, okay? Having back-up doesn’t mean you have the advantage.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Believe me, professor, these past few years have done a great deal to make me more aware of my own limitations,” Dimitri assured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…” Byleth glanced at her sister. “You just said you’ve overcome your previous limitations on your warping, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Yeah, that’s basically what I said,” Shez agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does that mean you could warp us to the Empire?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, probably! We’ve been to plenty of places in the Empire, so I’m sure we could get out there easily!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then that’s our plan. We’ll shadow warp over to make things easy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds good to me!” Shez said with a grin as she put a hand on her sister’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea’s eyes widened. “Wait, Shez, don’t–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But alas, her words did not reach the young Eisner sister, who promptly warped away with her older sister in tow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, did she just…?” Dimitri asked, looking at Rhea as the archbishop let out a deep, exasperated sigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For the love of–Of course she did…why am I surrounded by reckless children?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who are you calling a child?” Lysithea asked as she pushed her way into the tent, raising an eyebrow at Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not you, Lysithea, just…Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that is much more reasonable. Though, now that you mention her, where is Shez? I should think we ought to make our plans to visit the Empire sooner rather than later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea stared at the young albino woman for a moment, then just waved her off. “Dimitri, you handle this. I’m going to see to my cardinals and the possible survivors in the canyon, and then I’m going to chase down those reckless idiots before they manage to set fire to Enbarr.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–Wait, Lady Rhea–” But alas, his words did not reach the archbishop, who promptly left the tent without another word to him. “...why do people keep ignoring me…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dimitri.” He paused, then turned to Lysithea, who was frowning up at him with a distinctly unimpressed expression. “Where is Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...ah…well…er, would you believe me if I said I do not know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alas, she did not.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, far, far south of Garreg Mach, a certain pair of sisters abruptly found themselves in the middle of a vaguely familiar street that was almost immediately filled with the sounds of screaming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah, what?” Shez looked around, blinking in confusion as she saw people all around them, suddenly running away from the pair of sisters while screaming things like “IT’S ANOTHER INVASION!” and “TYRANTS! TYRANTS IN THE CITY!!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth, meanwhile, pressed a hand to her face and let out a deep sigh. “Shez. Where are we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, uh…the Empire, I think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…yeah, yeah, it’s definitely the Empire! See, I remembered how we went to Enbarr when we were kids and figured I could just head over here! And it worked!” Shez stated, before stumbling a bit, suddenly looking dizzy, “W-Woah, guess I went too far.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned, a little worried. “Are you okay, Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah, just…guess I do actually have a limit to how far I can warp…or how much I can warp? One of those…” She took a breath, rubbing at her head. “Ah, definitely feeling weirdly tingly right now…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, we should find a place to sit down–” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“DON’T MOVE!” Pausing, Byleth looked up to see that they were surrounded by soldiers dressed in imperial garb, all pointing spears at them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Invaders, drop your weapons!” another shouted as the soldiers inched closer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Hey, no, we're not invading!” Shez responded, standing on shaky legs, “We're here to see Edelgard!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“THEY’RE AFTER THE EMPEROR!” So it seemed that wasn’t the best response Shez could have given.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Hey, seriously, guys, we’re not a threat–” Shez tried to explain, before blinking when she heard a sword clatter to the ground beside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We surrender,” Byleth stated, raising her empty hands over her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...eh? W-Wait, By–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She also surrenders.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No I don’t!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes you do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, hang on, there’s no way I’m going to surrender to a bunch of–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Minutes later, Byleth sat calmly on the bed across from her sister, who was shackled to the wall of their cell. “So. What did we learn?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That apparently you’ll give up the second we’re in trouble,” Shez grumbled, pouting at her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If they had attempted to hurt you, I would have rewound time and actually fought them. They didn’t, so I didn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well–Wait, hang on, you can rewind time!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. You know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So rewind time! Make it so I didn’t mess up!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean ‘no’?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean no. This is a learning experience.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...feh…why am I shackled though?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You tried to bite a guard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I couldn’t stab him, you made me drop my sword!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One of the guards called me a ‘polite young lady’,” Byleth said, giving her sister a small, amused smile, “I think that means I won at being arrested.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can't win at being arrested!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And yet, I have.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just you wait till my head stops hurting, then I'll be breaking out of here without you,” Shez pouted as she leaned back against the wall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don't worry, I'll make sure to rewind if things go badly or if we spend too long here. For now though, keep this in mind to fight your impulse control.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you, I have great control.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You warped all the way to wherever you left the Sword of the Creator because the idea came to you. Then you warped both of us to Enbarr for the exact same reason,” Byleth pointed out, “You can be impulsive. It’s just something we’ll have to work on–” She paused, glancing past the cell bars. “Someone’s coming.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then immediately quieted down, tilting her head and listening. After a moment, she heard the same thing her sister had. Three sets of footsteps, two slightly louder. Leather boots in front, slightly off pace–a limp perhaps–and armored boots following. A noble and two guards?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth leaned against the wall, keeping a careful eye on where the group would be approaching from. While she doubted the guards would do anything stupid, she wasn’t risking Shez’s safety if there were any idiots who wanted to start trouble. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Luckily, the person approaching wasn’t an idiot at all, and Byleth felt a smile come to her face as she was finally reunited with one of her students. “Hello Hubert.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Hubert von Vestra, right hand man to the Emperor of Adrestia and Minister of the Imperial House, stared at his long lost professor for a moment, then let out a deep, exasperated sigh. “Hello Professor. How is it that the first time I’ve seen you in three years, you’ve managed to get yourself locked in a jail cell?” He held up a hand before Byleth could speak. “No, don’t answer. It was Shez’s fault.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey! You don’t know that for sure!” Shez complained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was,” Byleth confirmed, earning an annoyed grumble from her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert let out a deep sigh again, “Am I correct in assuming the ‘Tyrant’ that appeared, was just her warping into the middle of the city?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. It was handy, but it did mean we left Dimitri and Rhea mid-conversation." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert frowned. “Hm. So the archbishop has returned…Though I must say professor, I'm surprised to hear you met up with Prince Dimitri before her majesty.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don't remind me,” Byleth said with a pout, “I wanted to come here sooner, but everyone kept dragging me along with their stuff first. Speaking of, is Edelgard here?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, she's currently on the Eastern Front.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Then why are you here? I thought it was your job to be a ghost around her?” Shez asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I received an injury during an attempt to take Fort Merceus, so Lady Edelgard ordered me to return to Enbarr to recover and ensure nothing went awry while she's gone,” Hubert explained, before giving Shez a wry look, “Such as someone warping into the middle of the city in an attempt to invade.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Well, good thing we’re not here to invade then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A very good thing indeed,” he agreed, his voice dripping with sarcasm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Is everyone there with Edelgard?” Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A majority of our classmates are assisting her, yes, though Bernadetta accompanied me when I was sent back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh that's good, I'll be happy to see her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So are you two dating or are you still overly devoted to Edelgard?” Shez asked, before pausing in thought, “Though, huh, I guess you could be both? I think even Bernie might get jealous if her man was fully devoted to someone else though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bernadetta understands my devotion to Lady Edelgard and her cause,” Hubert bluntly stated before opening up the cell door, “Come along, Professor. We should hear what you’ve been up to these past three years.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright. Thank you, Hubert,” Byleth said as she got up from the bed, earning a blink from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…hang on, guys? Shouldn't you unshackle me so I can come along?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t recall you being a part of our class, Shez,” Hubert remarked, “So it wouldn’t be right for you to attend a class reunion. You understand, of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey come on, at least unshackle me so I can lay on the bed!” Shez shouted as Hubert closed the door, “If you walk away I'm going to rattle these chains so loudly!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could you have one of the guards let her free once we leave?” Byleth requested in a low voice while she walked away with Hubert, pretending to ignore Shez’s angry chain rattling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can you guarantee she won’t try to take advantage of that generosity and make an escape attempt?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I’ll take full responsibility if she does anything dumb.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then I’ll ensure she’s released at an appropriate time,” Hubert stated, getting Byleth to smile, before she glanced down at his limp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...How is everyone?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well enough for those that have been at war for three years. Some thrive amidst the combat, others are weary of it, but for the most part, everyone is healthy and are carrying out their duties as they should be,” he explained, “I imagine your return will be very good for their morale.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth imagined that was Hubert’s way of saying everyone would be happy to see her again, which was a nice thought to keep with herself as she followed him up from the dungeons.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In fact, we can confirm that theory right now,” Hubert stated before pushing open a door leading into a lounge, where a familiar girl whose messy hair was tied up in a topknot was waiting, a book in hand, “Greetings, Bernadetta.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Bernie.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey there Hubert, Professor, was everything okay?” Bernadetta asked, setting her book down as she stood up, before pausing. “P-PROFESSOR!?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It's nice to see you again, Bernie,” Byleth said, a small smile on her face, before she suddenly had to grab onto the skittish archer when she practically tackled her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Y-You're back! When did you get back!?” Bernadetta asked, looking…down at Byleth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh, you're taller than me now,” Byleth couldn't help but note, bringing her hand up to check the difference in height between the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Huh? Ah–I-I’m sorry! I-I didn’t mean to!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not upset, I just find it interesting. Hm…is this what it feels like to be a proud mama?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bernadetta blinked. “Um…I-I don’t think you’re that much older than me, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t that something parents are supposed to say? ‘You got so big’?” Byleth paused to think before turning to face Hubert. “You better treat her right, or else.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...your mind is an enigma as always, professor.” Hubert sighed. “Would you like me to make some tea?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, please. Though…hm, don’t you prefer coffee? Maybe that would be better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can stomach tea as necessary, professor–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well now we have to have coffee. As your mother-in-law, I’m not letting you have a drink you don’t like just for propriety’s sake.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hubert sighed again while Bernadetta looked oddly touched. “Professor, you are not my mother-in-law.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not yet. I don’t see a ring on Bernadetta’s finger. You need to fix that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you wouldn’t be my mother-in-law regardless. Bernadetta isn’t your daughter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She could be. And besides, I would still be your lady-in-law once I work things out with Edelgard.” She paused, frowning in thought. “That isn’t too presumptuous, is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is, and you wouldn’t be my ‘lady-in-law’ either way since that isn’t a real term,” Hubert stated, starting to remember why he found it so exhausting to interact with the professor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Fine. Oh, and it should be obvious I’m not an Agarthan infiltrator, so don’t try to poison me to make sure. I’ll know and I’ll make it very awkward for both of us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...It's surprising how much more…vocal you've become, Professor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The void did things to me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. I suppose I shall go fetch the coffee.” Hubert said, walking away wishing to be done with the conversation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Byleth said, before smiling at Bernadetta again, “I'm glad to see you're okay.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-All of us are. Edelgard did her best to make sure everyone stuck together, regardless of how tough things got…” Bernadetta said, her eyes starting to grow teary eyed, “W-We never gave up on looking for you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What else could Byleth do but hug her? “Thank you. I’m so glad to see you again, and I’m sorry I couldn’t be here sooner. I’m so proud of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To very little surprise, that brought even more tears to Bernadetta’s eyes as she tightly hugged Byleth back, letting her emotions loose in her professor’s comforting embrace. By the time Hubert returned, Bernadetta had started full on sobbing, which was somewhat awkward to come back to. Particularly since she was still sniffling as they sat down for tea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, it wasn’t the most awkward thing to happen at their reunion. No, that would be how Byleth paused right before taking a sip of her coffee, gave Hubert a distinctly unimpressed look, and poured the cup into a nearby plant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I said no poisons.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...it was a sedative–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Poison is poison, Hubert, and I can taste the difference.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? I was under the impression it was a tasteless poison.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You just admitted it was poison. Also, my taste buds are different now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does that have to do with your change in hair color, and the fact that you have two eyes again?” Hubert questioned, before pausing when Bernadetta tugged on his sleeve. He turned, then actually had to hold back a wince when he saw she was glaring at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“D-Don’t poison the professor!” Bernadetta ordered, her voice only slightly wavering, which earned a very proud smile and a pat on the head from Byleth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...very well. Now then, I believe you were about to discuss the ‘void’ you claim to have been trapped in?” Hubert deflected, trying to ignore Bernadetta’s continued pout.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, right, that part…okay, we should probably let Shez out of her cell to share her side of things. This is going to be a long story.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>“Why do you look like an onion?” were the first words Shez said to Bernadetta in three years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suffice to say, the lady of House Varley was fairly bewildered by that question. “U-Um…I do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, your hair does. The way you tie it up makes you look like an onion.” Shez paused, noticing Byleth’s frown. “That’s not a bad thing though! You look cute! Like…an onion!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...a-are onion’s cute?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They are when they look like you,” Shez said, nodding as though her words made perfect sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“U-Uh…thank you, I guess? I just have it like this to keep it out of my eyes,” Bernadetta explained as Hubert took a sip of coffee, choosing not to mention the new style was mainly thanks to a botched attempt on the archer’s part to cut her own hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh huh. Why not tie it back then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...i-it just works better like this,” Bernadetta mumbled, a little embarrassed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess? Hmm…hey, maybe I could cut it for you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t let Shez near your head with a knife,” Byleth advised, earning a pout from her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was one time…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bernadetta, meanwhile, had taken that advice in a very different way than Byleth had intended and was now watching Shez very warily, her mind filled with images of gruesome violence enacted at the hands of the purple-haired mercenary. “P-Please don’t stab Bernie’s brain out!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Leaving aside Bernadetta’s paranoid fantasies and Shez’s ineptitude,” Hubert interrupted, earning an offended gasp from Shez and a small whimper from Bernie, “Professor, I believe you were going to tell us about your extended absence.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, well, that starts with back in the monastery when Shez got taken over,” Byleth explained, glancing at her sister, who frowned at the thought of Epimenides.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I had a guy in my head who really didn't like Byleth and wanted her gone.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…does this have anything to do with your origins?” Hubert asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretty much. I got rid of him though, so you don't have to worry about that,” Shez said, giving him a thumbs up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Hubert made a mental note to question Byleth about that later. “I see…and you ended up in a…’void’ as you said?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rhea and me, yeah,” Byleth explained, “We were both stuck in there and didn't have a way out until Shez figured out how to get in on her own.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then pray tell, how exactly did you survive in this ‘void’ for three years?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I had someone in my head as well, though she was nicer. When it came down to it, she gave me her powers so that I could survive, even if it meant she would fade away,” Byleth elaborated, letting out a small sigh before she sipped some tea, “Mm…Her name was Sothis, and she was the goddess.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Hubert took a deep breath, before folding his hands and leaning forward, staring intently at Byleth and ignoring how Bernadetta had started choking on her drink. “I think you’ll need to explain a great deal more, professor.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“You know, I'm surprised you aren't clamoring to go straight to Edelgard,” Shez pointed out, staring at Byleth as they lounged around the tea room. Hubert and Bernadetta had left a little bit ago, the former apparently intent on making notes and writing messages while the latter just seemed to be following him for lack of anything better to do, all while mumbling something about “failing the goddess’s class”, which was silly considering Byleth knew Bernadetta passed her tests just fine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I love all of my students equally, and I'm not going to push my reunion to the side to see one in particular,” Byleth explained, “That and I push too much, Hubert will probably think I'm planning something devious.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I feel like the most ‘devious’ thing you could think of is stealing some food.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just because I get big portions doesn't mean I'd steal food.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about the times you took food from my plate, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, you would put whatever food you didn’t like onto my plate. Mostly vegetables,” Byleth pointed out, “You were a picky eater as a kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...yeah, well…I can’t think of an argument to that.” Shez huffed, crossing her arms over her chest and sinking in her seat. “...when do you think Hubert’s going to be back? I want to ask him how dad’s doing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. We can go look for him if he doesn’t–” And right on cue, Hubert entered the tea room again, an attempt at a pleasant smile on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello again, Professor, Shez,” he greeted while Bernadetta scurried in behind him, “I apologize for the wait, but I felt I should send a message to Emperor Edelgard as soon as possible to let her know of your return. I imagine your father would be with her, so he should be well-aware of your arrival as well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, thank you Hubert,” Byleth said with a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, gave him a very suspicious look. “Were you listening in on our conversation?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why Shez, it’s as though you do not trust me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t answer the question.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you really need my answer? Regardless, preparations will be made so we can return to her majesty's side. Though before that, I believe we need to get the two of you properly groomed.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Why's that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Need I remind you that you are meeting with the Emperor of Adrestia?” Hubert asked, a frown on his face, “That and while I understand the professor and the former archbishop have grown closer, I don't think Lady Edelgard will be happy seeing her in church garb.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right. Hopefully we can get something that fits me properly,” Byleth considered thoughtfully, before looking at Bernadetta, “Would you mind helping us, Bernadetta? I don’t know much about Adrestian fashion.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-H-Huh? W-Wait, w-why are you asking Bernie?? Sh-She’s not a fashionista, she doesn’t know anything!” she immediately protested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well you know how to dress yourself, so that’s good enough for me,” Shez decided, walking over to Bernie and pulling her to her feet, earning a startled squeak from the anxious noble. “Come on, let’s get moving or else I’ll carry you again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-Ah, n-no! W-Why do people think they can carry me like a sack of potatoes?!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll carry you like a princess if it’ll make you feel better, just get moving.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alas, despite her years of progress, Bernadetta was still very weak to anybody being even slightly forceful with her, and Hubert was zero help at all as the Eisner sisters essentially abducted the heir of House Varley to go pick out new clothes. Luckily for her, neither sister was especially adventurous when it came to fashion so things progressed fairly smoothly, with Byleth in particular being very happy afterwards thanks to her finding a new pair of leggings to replace her ruined ones.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And now my legs will always be warm,” she said with a smile, idly admiring the floral patterns in the mirror. Her current outfit largely resembled her old one, thanks to her finding some nice shorts to go with it, though the black, short-sleeved tunic she’d found actually showed off less of her chest than she was used to. A part of her was actually tempted to make a strategically placed tear in the fabric, before shrugging off the thought and returning to the gloves and armor pieces she intended to add to her selection.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez, meanwhile, had gone for something quite a bit fancier. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ta-dah!” the younger Eisner sister said with a grin, showing off the armor she’d appropriated from the Empire’s stock, “I call it the ‘Armor of Asura’! How’s it look?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Do you need that many scarves?” Byleth asked, tilting her head curiously at her sister’s new appearance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re not scarves, they’re…tassels? Or, no, it’s more like, uh…a four-pronged cape!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Interesting. Why ‘Asura’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dunno, it just kinda came to me. Fits me pretty well though, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth stared at Shez for a moment, fully taking in the changes in her appearance, the orange gleam of dawn’s light that never truly left her hair or eyes, how tall she had grown, and just how happy and confident she looked now that things were finally turning around. So, of course, she smiled. “It fits you perfectly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, thanks! You know, it actually is kinda crazy how well it does fit me,” Shez commented, putting her hands on her hips as she checked herself out in a nearby mirror, “It almost feels like it was made for me, which is pretty weird to think…hey Bernadetta, do you know anything about this armor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-Huh?” Bernadetta glanced up from where she’d been sitting while thinking about all the ways she could potentially screw up her professor's reunion with her classmates, “U-Uh, s-sorry, I don’t–W-What was the question?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just wondering if you know anything about this armor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“U-Um…I-I think E-Emperor E-Edelgard had it commissioned for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eep! I-I’m sorry, I-I don’t know anything else, I s-swear!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not mad, Bernie, I just…why’d she do that for me?” Shez asked, before glancing down at herself, “And how the hell did she get the proportions so right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did she make anything for me?” Byleth asked, curious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“E-E-Eh? U-Uh, m-m-maybe? I-I don’t, um…” Bernadetta trailed off, fidgeting with anxiety, before she let out a breath of relief as the door to the room the Eisners commandeered opened up and Hubert stepped in, followed by a face that made both sisters stiffen in surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right this way, Lieutenant,” Hubert said with a smile, before stepping to the side to let a very annoyed mercenary enter the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kid, you’re really trying my patience here. Why don’t you tell me what this surprise is supposed to be so I can get outta here already–” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ezra?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth wasn’t sure if it was her or Shez who spoke first, but either way, the lanky, scruffy mercenary cut himself off with a sudden start, his eyes going wide. “Byleth? Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez hugged him first, but Byleth wasn’t far behind, earning a startled laugh from the veteran mercenary before he returned the hug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Saints, I haven’t seen you two in years! Where were–wait, did both of you dye your hair?” he asked, happy and baffled in equal measure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, not exactly?” Shez began, pulling back and trying to think of how to explain everything that happened to her and Byleth over the past three years. Byleth, meanwhile, was not releasing the hug. “Okay, so, I guess it all started when I got possessed–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, off to the side, Bernadetta sidled up to Hubert, who was watching the proceedings with a small smirk. “…I-It was really nice of you to do this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Whatever do you mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Reuniting them like this. It’s nice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was practical,” Hubert retorted, “Now the Eisner sisters will both feel indebted to me and, by extension, Emperor Edelgard. It would have been better if I could have brought their father, but I suppose an honorary uncle will suffice.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” Bernadetta glanced over to the trio, a smile spreading on her face. “You're a lot nicer than you're willing to admit.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take it as you will,” Hubert muttered, rolling his eyes as he moved to sit down, letting the mercenaries reunite. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, not every part of their reunion was positive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Victor’s dead?” Ezra asked, genuinely surprised, “I thought that prick would live forever…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah…it wasn’t great finding that out,” Shez replied, ignoring the insult. She knew how the two lieutenants could be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. I wish we’d gone there earlier…” Byleth murmured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, nobody can know how things might play out,” Ezra pointed out, “Fodlan’s a big place and we’re in a dangerous line of work. Victor knew the risks, and the only reason he’d be upset going out the way he did is that he didn’t get to see you two before he went.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He smiled at the two of them and ruffled their hair, earning a smile from Byleth and a playfully dramatic huff from Shez, before his expression turned serious. “We can hold a funeral later. Right now, the most important thing is that I get the two of you to your father.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. Where is he?” Byleth asked, not noticing how Shez winced at the mention of their dad.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ezra did notice, but he didn’t say anything. “Right now, he’s on the Eastern Front with the emperor and her strike force, along with the rest of those church knights, trying to reclaim Fort Merceus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fort what now?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fort Merceus, also called ‘The Stubborn Old General’, is one of the Empire’s major cities,” Byleth readily explained, the information she taught in class quickly coming back to her, “It’s a fortress city that serves as the capital of Bergliez County and is famous for being impregnable.” A frown came to her face. “If the Agarthans captured it…no wonder the war has been in a stalemate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed,” Hubert spoke up, “Losing Fort Merceus was one of the most costly events of the war for her majesty. Not only did its seizure stymie our attempts to retake the lands Hrym had stolen, but it has opened Enbarr up to attack and strained her majesty’s relationship with Count Bergliez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why isn’t he the one trying to take it back then?” Shez asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Unfortunately, the reality of having enemies on all sides means Count Bergliez and a majority of the Imperial Army have been stretched thin trying to stave off the Kingdom’s invasions. The simple reality that we are faced with is that the Empire is at an unprecedented disadvantage, and the only way to regain that advantage is to ensure Fort Merceus is reclaimed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Which is what you need us for,” Shez finished, crossing her arms over her chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then that’s what we’re doing,” Byleth decided, nodding to Hubert, “Do you have a way of getting us there quickly?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do recall who you are speaking to, professor.” Hubert smirked, raising a hand and allowing dark magic to flow upwards from his palm. “I am entirely capable of taking you there myself–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Bernadetta poked his side and his magic fizzled out entirely with a pained hiss. He glared at the archer, but, for once, she didn’t falter in frowning back at him. “You’re still injured…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I can simply take some concoctions–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He was injured with the black weapons, the ones that don’t heal easily,” Bernadetta explained, turning to her professor and earning a scowl from Hubert.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do not act as though I am an invalid!” he argued, before pausing when Bernadetta turned her worried frown towards him again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you really think you can take them there without hurting yourself?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Hubert considered saying something very cruel in that moment, something that would assuredly undercut the archer’s confidence and make her back down. “...” Instead of doing that though, he turned his gaze back towards Byleth and Shez. “I can provide steeds that should get you there before the day ends.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He ignored the happy smile Bernadetta gave him, instead watching as the professor nodded. “Okay, then let’s get moving. I don’t want anyone else to get hurt before I can get to them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are the chances of someone going after Edelgard today of all days?” Shez questioned with a raised eyebrow, before pausing when Byleth and Ezra both sighed. “...aw, damn it. Did I just jinx us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You did,” Bernadetta affirmed, initially calm but with an obvious panic growing in her eyes, “You absolutely, definitely, completely did, and now Edelgard is going to be assassinated and cities will burn and oh goddess, what if the sky just explodes?!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Okay, I’m pretty sure at least one of those isn’t going to happen.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“I gotta say, I can’t see how our people could take being underground for all these centuries,” Shax commented as he gazed up at the evening sky, watching as the sun began its slow descent beneath the horizon, “These kinds of views feel too beautiful to just miss out on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Our ancestors had far greater concerns than pretty skies, fool,” Dolofonos reprimanded, his own eyes instead focused past the fields surrounding Fort Merceus and towards the distant Imperial encampment, where his targets lay unsuspecting of the incoming threat, “The abominations and their ilk needed extermination, and our people have been dedicated to that cause for well over a thousand years! Do you truly think such immaterial phenomena warranted their attention?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm hm, yeah, I would say so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...then you truly are a fool.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you say so.” Shax lowered his gaze from the distant sky and looked towards the camp instead, all while ignoring the old man’s urge to grab the disrespectful Dolofonos by the neck and squeeze until it snapped. The idea appealed, sure, but then he’d get in trouble with Papa Myson, and that just wouldn’t be practical.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead, he focused on the camp where he’d soon spill an emperor’s blood. Time and the threat of attack had turned a war camp into something of a fort itself, scarlet banners bearing black eagles flying over the high walls and watchtowers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was funny. The Emperor put so much emphasis on her school days that she took the black eagle as a personal symbol instead of the standard Imperial gold. Remarkably sentimental for a monarch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax had to admit, in the privacy of his own mind, he was curious about her. In the eyes of his superiors, she was a failed experiment who needed to be wiped out. Yet for a ‘failure’ to not only escape the grasp of the Agarthan sages but also be in open war against them and holding her own? Shax was confident enough in his abilities to know he would defeat her, yet he couldn't help but respect her too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even the old man couldn't help but acknowledge the strong opponent Shax would have to face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A part of him couldn't help but wonder that if she had not broken free, would they have become allies? Perhaps it could have been the two of them against his wayward sister and the Fell Star.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had to admit, the thought was strangely appealing. His ally here, Dolofonos…he wasn’t exactly impressive, for all he claimed to be some kind of special sage. And with Lady Bias going off on her own mission, he felt…dispirited. A bad thing to feel before a battle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So he did the logical thing: Clapped his hands together and grinned. “Alright, I’ll be right back. Don’t try starting things early, else I might not make it back in time to help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Where do you think you’re going–?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax thought he was going to visit one of the people he actually liked in this world, so he did exactly that, vanishing from the ramparts and reappearing in a carriage traveling towards a city destined to be burned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, it’s you. Myson’s little project.” Bias sighed, eyeing the sudden intruder in her carriage with a raised eyebrow. “What would have happened to you if I decided to leave something on that seat you’re perched on?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Nothing, probably. It’s not as though I can teleport into a solid object. I probably would just be sitting on top of whatever thing you put here,” Shax explained, before pausing and grinning as a thought occurred. “Does the fact that you didn’t block my seat mean you thought I would visit?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t. It just means I didn’t have anything I wanted to put there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Hm…well were you hoping I would visit?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias sighed again. “What do you want, Shax?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy in question brightened at the use of his chosen name. “I just wanted to check in with you, Lady Bias. You are going to be leading an attack soon and I’m going to be participating in one too, so I thought it would be good to chat ahead of time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you abandoned your post because you felt like chatting?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t say I abandoned it, I can go back at any time. I know where Dolofonos is, so I can just head back to where he is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Is that how your version of the ‘shadow warp’ works?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sort of? I think so, at least. It’s easier than trying to visualize a place. As long as I have a specific person I can travel to, I can travel to where they are, and I have connections to our people so it’s even easier to travel to them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…so you can go to places you’ve never been before as long as you have an ally present there. A limit, but also a benefit,” Bias mused, a thoughtful look crossing the sage’s scarred face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax’s gaze lingered on those scars, partially hidden beneath the veil she wore, each one telling a fascinating story of pain and injury. “What’s it like, burning a city?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Painful. My body burns with the same heat that the beasts burn in. Myson talks about making these things more stable, but I can tell he only cares about making them more powerful,” Bias said, flicking the necklace around her neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Huh, gonna be honest, didn't expect that answer. Would have thought you enjoyed it more.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don't feel anything slaughtering these beasts. Them and Myson are just stepping stones for what I want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax nodded. “The Fell Star’s death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Curiously, Bias paused there. She glanced at the carriage’s door, a curtain drawn over the window to hide the countryside. “...My sister died in a carriage just like this one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She did? What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A truly stupid turn of events. She was riding with Thales and an ill-timed spell caused a landslide. The carriage was damaged and she likely died on impact.” Bias took a breath. “Likely. Thales though, he crawled free. There was dark magic in the area, as my mentor described it, so it’s likely, </span>
  <em>
    <span>likely</span>
  </em>
  <span>, that he buried the carriage himself and then died like a fool when it brought the rest of the mountain down on his head.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...huh. I haven’t heard all that much about Thales,” Shax admitted, “Nobody seems to talk about him anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Our people prefer to forget the dead while remembering the grudge. If you want to take any sort of lesson from his example, I’d say…learn to recognize when you’re still in danger. Arrogance tends to be our greatest killer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! In that case I'm already leagues ahead of him. I might have been willing to take on the Fell Star and my sister, but I knew well enough to not take on an army on my own.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And that’s how you die,” Bias retorted, unimpressed, “You’re at least smart enough to know when to run, I’ll give you that, but it’s when you think you don’t need to run that they’ll get you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax paused, raising an eyebrow. “Huh…how do you know when to run then? Because if you don’t know you should run, then how will you know when to…wait, does that sentence make sense?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m saying you shouldn’t waste time on dramatic speeches or posturing. Just get the job done and go. And if the job isn’t worth it, go before it kills you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that what you do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mostly, but also I’m a massive hypocrite so you shouldn’t listen to my advice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax blinked, then laughed. “Then how do you know if the job is worth it then?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That depends on you. Do you only care about Myson's approval, or do you wish for something more?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…” He could picture what the old man would want. Killing anyone he wanted, ruling over whatever land he claimed, drinking and indulging in whatever pleasures he desired. Shax could see the appeal in that kind of lifestyle, but he didn’t really feel like the kingly type. “What about your approval?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias rolled her eyes. “Try to come up with something better than that by the next time we talk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax huffed in annoyance at the dismissal, before grinning. “Fine, I’ll come up with something amazing for a life goal by the next time I see you. So that means you’re not allowed to be arrogant before then, got it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should be saying that to you, boy.” She drummed her fingers on her knee, staring at the strange creation Myson brought into this world. “One of these days, you’ll have to tell me what Myson did to make you turn out so stable. Otherwise I’ll have to dissect you for the answer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, there’s no need to do that, I’m fine with explaining. To put it simply, Papa Myson didn’t exactly grow a new clone of my sister in the traditional way. It’s more like…he repurposed some materials that already existed.” He grinned, his emerald eyes flashing crimson for a moment. “Obviously he had to alter some things, but hey, it wasn’t like we were really using those corpses except as some kind of last ditch failsafe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You don’t exactly have the same build as Nemesis,” Bias noted, earning a laugh from Shax.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh sure, but he wasn’t the base used. Papa Myson is a smart guy, the type to use things other people disregard, and the project to remake the Great Sage had plenty of failures before my sister was born. There wasn’t much left of those past mistakes, but he used what he could along with the blood you retrieved from my sister, plus plenty of samples from the previous King of Liberation to make me turn out the way I did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh.” A gleam of curiosity entered Bias’s eyes as she leaned forward with a newfound interest. “And how would you turn out if you added more than that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why stop with just the King? Why not all of the so-called Elites?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...because I didn’t think of that before now. Huh.” Shax tilted his head thoughtfully, considering the suggestion. “Hmm…thanks for the talk, Lady Bias. You’ve given me a lot to think about.” He grinned. “See ya~!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he vanished, returning back to the fort just in time to startle Dolofonos.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gh–W-Where did you just go? We were about to launch the operation–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you weren’t. I told you not to until I got back,” Shax bluntly stated, before smirking, “No need to worry though, my head’s clear now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s go kill an Emperor.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>Edelgard von Hresvelg, the young emperor of Adrestia, let out a tired sigh as she tried to rub the urge to sleep from her eyes. Rest was something she could ill-afford at the moment, not when her scouts were reporting new movements from Fort Merceus, and certainly not when she had even more reports to read through before making strategic decisions that would impact the lives of everyone under her command.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let out a sigh and rubbed her furrowed brow, trying to ease away some of the stress of her position. The news lately had been…mixed. On a positive note, apparently the Alliance was intending to join the war in earnest now that the Almyrans had been repelled and Ordelia’s territory reclaimed. Then, on a negative note, there were already rumors circulating that some type of disaster had befallen the monastery and the Knights of Reclamation living in the Red Canyon. The news was vague, information could only travel so fast, but it was possible that fool posing as “the Flame Emperor” had done something drastic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If they had, it was likely the Knights of Reclamation that were meant to be helping her would go scurrying back to the canyon, either out of a misplaced sense of duty or a more reasonable desire to help their imperiled comrades. She couldn’t fault the church remnants for wanting to rescue their main force from whatever may have happened, she just had a difficult time extending them any charity after their recent showings. Having an extra army trying to seize Fort Merceus should have been a boon, but the knights often clashed with her soldiers and Seteth seemed to believe he had more authority in the camp than he did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard distinctly remembered having to stop Hubert from outright attacking the former chamberlain when he tried to give her orders under the guise of “offering advice”. Even then, things wound up devolving into particularly vicious insults before Jeralt interceded. She was lucky to have the former mercenary turned general here to keep the peace, though the thought of him once again brought to mind her missing professor–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Edelgard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A voice brought her out of her thoughts, bringing her attention towards the tent’s entrance. “Oh, Flayn. Did you need something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I was hoping to speak with you,” the young bishop replied. She’d certainly been surprised when Edelgard offered her that position, but she took well to it. Better than most, though Seteth hadn’t been pleased when he heard. Edelgard was fairly certain he still bore a grudge for that revelation ruining his reunion with his wayward daughter. “I hope this isn’t a bad time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, not especially.” Edelgard smoothed her papers out and got up from her seat to directly face her former classmate. “Is the matter urgent?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Um…yes, it is. Well, in the sense that I think you should know about it urgently, though I am unsure if we can act on the information right now…ah, to explain, my father and Captain Jeralt received word from a surviving member of the knights that were at Zanado.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard felt her brow furrow. “So something did happen. By ‘surviving member’, I assume some sort of attack took place directed at the Knights of Reclamation?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, though it sounds less like an army attacked and more like a large group of demonic beasts swarmed into the canyon. They may have been directed by magic, though I’m not completely sure,” Flayn explained with a worried frown, “My father and Cardinal Luca are obviously upset and I’m worried they might be about to go back to the canyon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you think they’ll desert?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think the entire group might. The reclaimers might be on our side, but you and I know it is because they think we support their ideas. If they decide that reclaiming Zanado matters more than trying to take back Fort Merceus…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard sighed, rubbing her temple to try to stave off a building sense of irritation. It wasn’t like the “Reclaimers” had even been that useful, particularly with their insistence on being independent from Imperial command, but it would still be a blow to the forces they had gathered here. To say nothing of how it would affect morale to have such a large force abandon them… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see I'll need to speak with them,” Edelgard muttered, as she began to head out of the tent, “Do you know where they are?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I last saw them by the canteen, but maybe you should save this for tomorrow? You look exhausted.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The sooner I deal with this, the sooner I have one less problem to deal with later,” Edelgard responded, before pausing. She began to look around, searching the crowds of soldiers all around her as they attended to what duties they had or simply spent time with friends. It was still early in the evening so the camp was still active. So why did she feel like there was something out of place?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is something wrong, Edelgard?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...No, I suppose the night air was brisker than I realized,” Edelgard said, her exhaustion momentarily forgotten as tension built in her shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn frowned. “Perhaps we should return to your tent for–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Nabatean stilled, some age-old instinct recently reawakened by the pressures of war  warning her of danger right as a completely ordinary soldier passed by her. Something about the way he moved, the purpose in his step, made her look at him, her ear twitching at the sound of cloth against metal–Her hand shot forward, grabbing him by the wrist, and she could feel a knife up his sleeve.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Flayn? What are you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tch.” The assassin clicked his tongue, ignoring the emperor for the moment as he suddenly twisted and Flayn saw a flash of steel going right towards her–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard’s fist crashed into the assassin’s side with an audible crunch as several of his ribs broke at once. He had a moment to choke, spittle mixed with blood flying from his mouth, before Flayn used a technique her professor had shown her back at the monastery to pull him fully over her shoulder and slam him against the ground, using the man’s weight against him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man only had a moment to gasp out in pain, before Edelgard kicked him in the head, knocking him out completely as the soldiers around them began to react. Shouts of panic began to ring out, soldiers clamoring that there had been an assassination attempt on Edelgard, while some rushed to her aid–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard only had a moment to react, jerking backwards as one of those approaching soldiers attempted to slice her throat open. She found her footing without stumbling and deflected the second attempt to stab her, right before she noticed Flayn raise a hand out of the corner of her eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shut her eyes tight, but there was still enough brightness to the flash of light to see it through her eyelids. It still kept her from being blinded while the second assassin screamed in pain, clutching at his eyes after the bright light seared them. Fortunately for him, he didn’t have to linger with that pain for long when Edelgard smashed her fist into his jaw, sending him to the ground in a single blow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“ASSASSINS IN THE CAMP!” rang out loud as Flayn moved to Edelgard’s side, her eyes wide with alarm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Edelgard, you’re bleeding!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The emperor paused, then glanced at her arm, where a thin cut had gone through her sleeve. “It’s nothing, I can–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her head swam before a sudden comfort spread through her body, cool and soothing as Flayn pressed a glowing hand to the wound. “Venin blades–We can’t let them cut you again!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t planning to allow them to,” Edelgard stated, her attention turning to the camp as more shouts and cries went up, along with sudden bursts of fire and lightning. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Of course they would aim to burn the camp. They’ll be targeting my fellow Eagles.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Flayn, grab Labraunda from my tent then stay with me! We need to regroup!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Understood!” Flayn moved quickly, immediately acting as ordered and soon enough, Edelgard felt the familiar weight of her sacred axe in her hand. It was time to clear out these fools that thought they could take her head.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“You really did jinx us,” Byleth remarked at the sight of half the Imperial camp ablaze, a deep frown on her face as she urged her new wyvern onward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t mean to!” Shez retorted, scowling at the flames below from her own pegasus, “How was I supposed to know–You know what, never mind, let’s just figure out where your students are and get this over with!” She glanced back at Bernadetta, who was riding with her and had her arms wrapped tightly around her waist. “Do you see any of them, Bernie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What?? H-How am I supposed to see them from up here?!” the archer squeaked, tightening her grip as thunder boomed down below.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re an archer, you should have good eyesight!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Th-That’s not how it works! I can’t see when it’s nighttime and there’s smoke and fires ruining my night vision–” Bernadetta paused as a flash of light caught her attention. “W-Wait, that’s–Ah! That’s Edelgard, down there! That’s her axe!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, you see? I was right!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, then that’s where we’re going,” Byleth decided, before she stood up in her saddle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that–Wait, what are you doing–” Shez began to ask before Byleth leapt from her wyvern. “WHA–YOU DUMBASS!” She immediately passed the reins of the pegasus to Bernadetta, who blinked in surprise. “Hold this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-W-Wait, Shez, are you–” Bernadetta tried to ask before the mercenary abruptly vanished from the saddle, leaving the archer to try to steady the steed as she was suddenly abandoned in the middle of the sky. “Ah–Oh I knew I shouldn't have come along! Why do you do this to yourself, Bernie!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, a certain plummeting professor searched the burning camp below for signs of her students. The world moved in slow motion around her as she assessed the situation, her powers over time bringing everything to a crawl while she took note of who she could spot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was Ferdinand, calling out commands and leading the efforts in quelling the flames. No assassins around him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was Linhardt, teeth grit as he tried to heal a wounded soldier without getting too close to the blood leaking from her wounded chest. Caspar was with him, his fist crushing the skull of the assassin that swung the blade. Blood hung, suspended in the air as it became clear the assassin wouldn’t survive Caspar’s blow. Not an immediate threat then.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was Marianne, atop a familiar steed as she called down a rain of ice over burning fortifications. She hadn’t seen the assassin poised to leap. Byleth had.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In a sudden jolt, time resumed and Byleth repositioned herself, feet now pointed towards the ground. By all rights, a fall like this would injure her, were she still fully human.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dirt and dust exploded outward as she landed, but she’d already moved, leaping and swinging her sword to cleave straight through the foe that would have hurt her student. He fell in two halves while she rolled to her feet, eyes scanning for more danger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She paused, glancing up at the utter awe in her student’s voice, and nodded. “Hi Marianne. I would love to talk soon, but I need to make sure everyone is safe. You’re doing great.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Th-Thank you…th-thank you!” Marianne called out, surprised but smiling as a sudden joy swelled in her heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With a small smile in return, Byleth rushed off, searching for anyone else in danger. It was hard to tell who was an enemy right away now that she was in the thick of it, but as time slowed to a halt again, she could see Shez cutting down an assassin who had been clashing blades with Petra. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nearby, Constance and Hapi were covering Dorothea while the songstress helped an injured soldier to cover. The former mercenary nearly dropped her control of time at the sight of her, but she kept her focus. They could talk once everyone was safe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, Byleth found Edelgard standing by Flayn while the pair scanned their surroundings. In that moment, her chest clenched as she saw a familiar smiling face behind the two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Noticing her, Shax waved, before his sword moved in the stopped time, aiming for the Emperor’s neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was no time to think. The Sword of the Creator swung out, racing across the distance and clashing with Shax’s false version. The chains intertwined, before Byleth felt herself suddenly get pulled off her feet as Shax yanked his sword back while cocking his fist. So Byleth did what came naturally and slammed her fist into his.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Time resumed in a boom of sound, elemental light and darkness bursting outwards with a rush of emerald and amethyst flames.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth glared into Shax’s eyes, his gaze burning a bright crimson in a distorted mirror of her sister. Shax grinned back, filled with glee at the prospect of fighting his fated foe.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And nearby, Edelgard’s eyes went wide at the sight of her professor. “Byleth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a sharp, painful noise as the mirrored swords pulled free from one another, their chains grinding before they settled back into proper blades. The noise didn’t matter though. What mattered was the impossible sight in front of the young emperor’s eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi Edelgard,” Byleth greeted, her gaze flicking towards her student for a moment before returning towards her grinning foe, “I’m sorry it took me so long to get back. I would really like to catch up soon, but it’ll have to be after this. Also, hi Flayn.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn didn’t respond, mostly because her jaw had dropped at her professor’s unexpected return. “...h-hi?? Hello?? Um…” She looked at Edelgard, hoping she had a better grasp of the situation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard simply nodded though, before moving to face Shax. “Shall I assume this is the enemy’s commander, professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably. His name’s Shax, he’s apparently Shez’s brother, and he has weird powers because of Agarthan experiments,” Byleth summed up, “He can’t reverse time, but he can tell when I do it and he’s able to still move when I stop time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can stop time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s a new thing. Goddess powers. I might be a dragon now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard processed that information, then just nodded. “Understood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you two done catching up with each other?” Shax asked, crouched low and tensed as he prepared to lunge for the pair, “I don’t mind if you want to chat, but I was really looking forward to this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see. Then could you leave and let us talk instead of fighting?” Byleth requested, making Shax blink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I…no? Obviously no.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm. Then, before we start, did you kill a bald, heavyset man in the Red Canyon? He would have been with a blonde woman.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The clone cocked his head. “Huh. You knew that guy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Should I take that as a yes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should, because I did. Mind if I ask why you care?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth shook her head. “I don’t mind. I wanted to make sure you were the one who killed Victor and took Candace’s arm. I owe you for both of them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh really? If I knew offing some random mercenaries was all it took to get you raring to fight, I would’ve hunted the blonde too.” Shax smirked. “Actually, is your papa somewhere around here? Maybe I should take his head–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he taunted her, Shax kept an eye on Byleth’s sword, ready for her to swing. The moment she extended it, he'd strike. Yet instead of doing what he thought the logical thing was, Byleth instead launched a fireball at his face, the explosion nearly engulfing him as he jumped back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jeez, can't take a joke huh?” Shax asked, smirking while the smoke began to dissipate. Bringing his sword up, he blocked the Sword of the Creator as it whipped through the smoke, its chain wrapping around his own blade. He felt himself get pulled forward for a moment, before pulling back, making the blade go taut as Shax stared down the former mercenary. “I know you’re strong and all, but you didn't think you'd be able to sweep me off my feet like that, did you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I'm just holding you in place.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At her response, Shax blinked, before seeing a shadow move over him. Looking up, he stared mouth agape as he saw the Emperor rushing down towards him, having leapt up into the air to smash him down. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Shit.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In an instant, Shax vanished out from under the emperor’s earth-shattering swing, warping a few feet away with an amused grin. “Alright, you can be clever, I–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then a ball of light hit him straight in the face, making the clone yelp as he clutched at his eyes with his free hand. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Shit! The small one, I forgot about the damn shortie–</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On a desperate instinct, he brought his sword up in an attempt at guarding himself, just in time to feel the emperor’s axe slam into his blade. And while the Sword of the Liberator was sturdy enough to meet the sacred axeblade without breaking, Shax was pretty sure he felt the bones in his arm rattle as he was sent skidding back, his feet digging into the dirt. He reoriented his sword and stabbed it into the ground, stopping his momentum and letting him keep his footing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax blinked the spots from his eyes just in time to see the Sword of the Creator swing straight for his head. So of course he warped again, his heart pounding in his chest as he felt a grin come to his face. His last fight with the Fell Star hadn’t been nearly this close–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had to deflect another fireball, then duck a cutting gale from the short lady, who was really starting to concern him. He hadn’t been expecting to deal with a support mage along with the Fell Star and the Emperor, and she was helping keep him more on the backfoot than he liked, so he did the logical thing of warping behind her and stabbing–Then he blinked as she deflected his attack with a staff of all things. That shouldn’t have been possible, but then he noticed the glow of sacred light on the stupid thing right before he realized her hand was raised right at his chest, green wind gathering at her palm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit–!” On instinct, he warped, but even then he’d felt the blades of wind cut into him in the half-second before the girl’s spell went off. Grimacing as he felt blood leak down his chest, Shax stared at his three opponents, reassessing his odds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay time out, who the hell is she?” he asked, leveling his sword at Flayn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My student,” Byleth answered, taking the pause to assess the bloodied Agarthan in turn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah no shit! I meant, what's her deal!? The only one of those beasts I was told to worry about was that Archbishop of yours!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am Flayn,” the Nabatean in question calmly stated, “And I believe you owe at least an arm to my professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“At least,” Byleth agreed, “I suppose I could be satisfied with your arm and the head of your boss, as long as you surrender.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, no chance of that,” Shax replied, his eyes flicking from threat to threat. He knew the Emperor was strong, but he had no idea she had one of the abominations as a bodyguard! And from what he could hear of the old man’s muttering, the bandit actually recognized her, which meant she had to be a dangerous one. “Have to say, I didn’t expect the Flame Emperor to have a secret weapon like this just wandering around her camp! I thought you understood how the abominations–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not speaking to you,” Edelgard bluntly stated, “Surrender or die.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harsh! I’m trying to establish a rapport here!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you’re trying to decide if this is a fight you can win,” Byleth noted, “Just like last time. And just like last time, the longer you take to fight us, the more likely it is that reinforcements will appear. Do you think you can win if that happens?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey now, I haven’t even gone all out yet, remember?” He grinned, markings beginning to spread across his skin as an orange glow surrounded his body. “So you really shouldn’t–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have a halo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax blinked, then raised an eyebrow at Byleth. “Excuse you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have a halo. Shez has one when she does that,” Byleth explained, a hint of curiosity entering her eyes, “You don’t have the same powers, do you? At least, you don’t have the entire thing that she does.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...what the hell is that supposed to–” A sudden twinge in his head made Shax whirl, his sword colliding with the twin blades wielded by his counterpart as Shez glared straight into his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, asshole. You owe me your life for taking Victor’s.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seriously, who the hell was that guy to you two!?” Shax questioned, before warping away right before Byleth’s extended sword could take his head off. He landed on his feet, but had to block another strike as Shez appeared right in front of him, fully able to keep up with him thanks to her own warp. “Gh–Damn it, you won’t get me like this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He warped again, this time behind Edelgard, and stabbed straight through absolutely nothing as she suddenly vanished.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WHAT!? SHE CAN DO THAT TOO!?” he yelped, baffled, before a flash caught his attention and he had to block two swords at once. He stumbled, trying to deflect each stab and strike, before Shez suddenly vanished. “Wh–Ah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a moment, Shax wished he had the ability to stop time too because all of a sudden a number of things made sense at once. First, Edelgard couldn’t warp, but Flayn could use Rescue to bring her out of danger. Second, his foes were much better at coordinating than he expected because Shez had just vanished right as Flayn cast what a small part of his mind recognized as Excalibur. Third, wind magic hurt. A lot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth watched as the sudden cyclone ripped into Shax, cutting into his armor and sending him flying up into the air to crash painfully into the dirt nearby and go limp, either dead or unconscious. She was glad the plan worked, especially since she’d had to keep the cues for it nonverbal, but she still glanced at Edelgard to see if she was okay. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The emperor looked exhausted and it was likely only a determination to see the fight to its end that was keeping her on her feet. She would need rest after this, which might be difficult to convince her of considering how bad the camp looked at the moment. And that wasn’t even addressing how much Byleth had to explain about these past few years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, they could fix things up and then have a proper reunion–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth paused, her brow furrowing as she heard…a flute? Strange music filled the air, the sound carrying despite the voices shouting and the roar of flames around the camp. And something about it…she could feel a strange sensation in her chest. Like a growing heat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The hell is that?” Shez muttered as she walked up beside her sister, swords still in hand while she frowned at the sound.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure,” Byleth responded, listening to the strange tune with a deep frown.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A-Ah…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Flayn? What’s wrong?” Edelgard asked, drawing Byleth’s attention towards the emperor as she worriedly checked over her fellow Eagle, who was clutching her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I do not…I do not know, something about that sound…” A faint glow formed around her body, green light beginning to emanate from her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What in the world…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Flayn!” Byleth hurried over to her students, but before she could do anything, the light faded as the music stopped and a voice sounded out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you proved to be useless after all. I should have expected as much,” stated a man dressed as an Imperial soldier. He held his side as he gazed down at Shax, then snorted contemptuously and kicked the fallen clone straight in the chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“GAH! F-Ffhah, w-what the hell?!” Shax choked out, glaring up at the soldier, “You prick! Why kick me!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What else should be done with a lazy fool?” the man questioned rhetorically, before turning his gaze towards the four women warily watching him.“The Fell Star and the Failed Vessel. Interfering again, I see. Bias should have burnt you both to ashes when she had the opportunity.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh great, another one,” Shez muttered, annoyed, “How many of you assholes are there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. You really are a foolish vessel. I am no mere ‘asshole’, I am Dolofonos! The Agarthan Sage of Blood!” he declared as his guise melted away, revealing a thin, lean man in black assassin’s garb, “And I am here to end you, so-called Emperor!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned and immediately moved in front of her students to protect them, though Edelgard didn’t respond at first. She stared at the declared assassin, her tired mind trying to think of why this particular Agarthan seemed familiar… “Oh. You’re the one Flayn threw into the dirt earlier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You threw him into the dirt?” Byleth asked, glancing at Flayn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, um…oh, yes, I did! Yes, that was earlier, he tried to stab Edelgard so I threw him over my shoulder, like you taught me, and Edelgard kicked him in the head,” Flayn readily explained, perking up a bit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shax glanced up at his superior. “So I’m the useless one, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You may have thwarted my first attempt on your life, traitor,” Dolofonos began, ignoring Shax, “But you have no idea the type of hell I’ve unleashed on your encampment!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does it have to do with the flute you have?” Shez asked, pointing with her sword to the flute in the assassin’s hand. The one that wasn’t holding his ribs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, with this, ‘The Demon’s Lure’, I have summoned a horde of demonic beasts to destroy this entire camp!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. So like Hapi’s curse?” Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dolofonos paused. “Who?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hapi. When she sighs, she summons demonic beasts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That…no, of course not! The Lure does not merely ‘summon’ demonic beasts, it calls upon an entire horde!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay. Where are they?” Byleth inquired.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...they will be arriving soon! They merely take time to get here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know demonic beasts show up immediately whenever Hapi sighs, right?” Shez pointed out, “I think you made a worse version.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, we didn’t, because the Lure summons a </span>
  <em>
    <span>horde</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“From where? Do they just show up or do you need to have a bunch of them already prepared?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop questioning the Lure! You do not need to know the details!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh damn it all,” Edelgard muttered, feeling a headache coming on, “Don’t you idiots have a number of beasts in Fort Merceus?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They did, in fact. And, at the moment, every single one of those demonic beasts were going berserk and attempting rip their way free of Fort Merceus so they could charge the Imperial encampment, much to the panic of the Agarthans still at the fortress who suddenly had to deal with their rampage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...that isn’t important!” Dolofonos insisted, “What is important is that you die tonight, traitor!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am not going to argue the semantics of my loyalty with a delusional assassin,” Edelgard stated, stepping forward with her axe in hand, “I don’t know how many of your comrades you brought. I doubt any of them are still alive. You’ve lost already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve lost nothing! You’re the one who lost! As we speak, my comrades are burning that damned city of Moss! Even if my mission fails, you’re already finished!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–Why would you tell her about that!?” Shax questioned, baffled by his superior’s inability to keep his mouth shut.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard, meanwhile, furrowed her brow. “Moss? Moss…Moz–Mozghuz?” Her eyes widened in alarm. “You’re burning Mozghuz?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s right! And you have no way of–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, can you warp to Mozghuz?” Byleth asked, turning to her sister.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, not sure, but maybe? I don’t know where that is exactly–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s a coastal city in Hevring territory,” Edelgard stated, immediately focused on Shez, “If I show it to you on a map, can you get there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, maybe? I’m not great at reading maps–Oh, maybe if someone sends me in the area, I could just head for the first flaming city I see?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dolofonos, meanwhile, was starting to think he said too much. So he defaulted to his first instinct and pulled a knife. “You’ll never get the chance–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he had to dodge as a sacred axe nearly split his head in twain. “Ha! Foolish traitor, I cannot be felled by–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he had to dodge, again, as the Sword of the Creator swung out and nearly took his head off. “Geh–Foolish Fell Star! I shall not be slain by–!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Finally, a cutting gale caught him in the chest and sliced him in half, a choked noise sounding out before the Agarthan Sage of Blood collapsed in a spray of his title’s namesake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah. Nice aim there, Flayn,” Shez praised, glancing at the frowning healer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, thank you! It’s better to aim for center mass with ranged attacks, right professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm hm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Still, was that your first time killing someone?” Shez asked, “Because I know that can be hard for you healer types–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t,” Flayn replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have fought in two wars, Shez. It would be surprising if I hadn’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...huh. Wait, was there another war before this one? Or is this the second–No, wait, hang on, I think I’m forgetting something…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s Saint Cethleann,” Byleth explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right! Yeah, okay, and Seteth’s Cichol, I remember now. Oh yeah, is he around here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can find him later, we still need to deal with your apparent brother,” Edelgard said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He already left,” Byleth pointed out, pointing towards the spot  on the ground where Shax had been, “He warped away when that assassin revealed their other plan.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, right, then we need to move. If we're lucky, they haven't begun to burn Mozghuz yet, but we shouldn't delay our response,” Edelgard stated, letting out a sigh. Though her eyes softened as she glanced at Byleth. “...We can talk afterwards.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would be happy to,” Byleth replied with a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, not to interrupt the happy reunion, but don’t we have to deal with the demonic beasts thing?” Shez asked, earning another sigh from Edelgard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. Problems never seem to cease…we’ll have to send scouts to see if there are actually any demonic beasts approaching, then perhaps send a team to cull them as needed. If we could divide our forces properly, with perhaps one half dealing with the threat while the other heads to Mozghuz to–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“FLAYN! WHERE ARE YOU!? ARE YOU SAFE?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Or someone else could interrupt me,” she muttered while Flayn grimaced, turning towards the sound of Seteth’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m here, father! Please stop shouting! Edelgard already has a headache!” she called back, trying to pitch her tone to carry without making Edelgard’s headache worse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“FLAYN!” Seteth had no such considerations, and him landing his wyvern nearby didn’t help matters, “Thank the goddess, I was so worried! Are you alright? You aren’t hurt, are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn tried not to grimace at her father’s fussing. “I’m perfectly fine, father. I was at Edelgard’s side the entire time. I was completely safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, she even killed the enemy commander!” Shez spoke up in support, though her words earned a sigh from Flayn and an alarmed look from Seteth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She did?! Flayn, are you–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Father, I am a war veteran, please stop coddling me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eesh, you’re still at it, Seteth?” an unexpected voice spoke up, making both Byleth and Shez pause, “I know you’re worried about your kid, but the rest of us are still trying to put out fires–…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt Eisner blinked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The noise of the camp seemed to fade away, the yelling of soldiers and crackling of flames melting into meaningless noise. Byleth felt her throat tighten up as she stared at her father, who looked exactly like she remembered. Rushing forward, she pulled the man into a tight hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Papa,” she murmured, pressing her face into his chest. She had too many thoughts in her head right now, worries and concerns, and she tried her best to focus on what was important. “I want to talk soon, but I have to make sure Mozghuz doesn't get burned down.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I…uh…what?” Jeralt responded, baffled. He still hugged her back, of course, obviously. His mind was just taking a moment to catch up with the fact that his daughter was in his arms again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm…I missed you,” Byleth replied. She attempted to pull back, but Jeralt just hugged her tighter, keeping her in place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I missed you too, kid,” he said, tears beginning to prick at his eyes. He was feeling too many emotions at once, though one rose above the rest as he started to look around. “Is Shez with you? Where…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A ways away, Shez stiffened when her father noticed her. She felt awkward, knowing it was her fault that Jeralt had been left alone this whole time–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh thank the goddess, you’re both okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then her father’s words registered, and she couldn’t stop herself </span>
  <span>from rushing right over and wrapping her arms around her family.</span>

  <span>Cities on the surface were remarkably dark at night. Unlike the constantly lit interior of Shambhala, there were only a few scattered lights visible in Mozghuz, a natural result of the city “going to sleep”. Its denizens would nestle safely in their beds, many unwilling to waste the candles needed to keep awake, while the few lantern-bearing travelers in the dark were primarily guards on patrol to ensure those denizens would have restful nights.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>None of them were aware of the oncoming destruction in human form. For that reason, Bias pitied them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not enough to let them live though.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned her gaze towards the other Agarthans assembled by the hillside. They were more eager, the mages gathered with tomes and staves meant to aid in the upcoming arson while the warriors stayed near the Ladons, keeping watch on the demonic beasts. They chatted about their intended slaughter with a casualness that Bias felt almost envious of.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Intellectually, she knew the Fodlaners were beasts. False humans that followed the will of the Fell Star and obeyed the abominations that stole the world from the only true people that existed in this corrupted land. Killing them was something to take satisfaction in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t felt satisfaction in a long time. And it brought thoughts to her mind that she wasn’t meant to think.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Bias!” Then a familiar voice pulled her from those thoughts, drawing her attention towards Myson’s mutant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shax. I thought you were supposed to be with Dolofonos,” she remarked, regarding the hybrid with a raised eyebrow, noting the wounds on him that were slowly healing on their own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry to say but I didn't feel like dying with him, especially after he spilled secrets.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What secrets were those?” she asked, idly glancing over the wounds she could see. Nothing beyond superficial damage, from the looks of it, but that was just at the surface.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well aside from rambling on about how that flute of his was supposed to work, he spilled the fact that you’re supposed to burn this city to the emperor and the Fell Star.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias paused in her examination, looking Shax directly in his eyes. “She’s in the empire already? You fought her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I did, and it didn’t go great. The emperor had one of the abominations as a bodyguard and they caught me off guard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? No, never mind, you can explain in a moment. To be clear, the Fell Star knows our plans and is coming here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, probably. I can’t imagine they’re going to let us burn one of their cities without…uh, Lady Bias?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? What is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re smiling.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Huh. So she was. Though to call the disturbing leer spread across her face could hardly be called a pleasant smile. “Why wouldn’t I be? You brought me good news.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias shook off the sense of ennui that had been weighing her down, turning her full attention to Shax. “We’re putting off the attack. Killing the Fell Star takes priority.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Wait, but Papa Myson ordered–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That prick doesn’t outrank me. Besides, burning a city doesn’t do anything for our cause while killing our people’s greatest enemy does,” she explained in a lighthearted, if raspy, tone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But our orders–“ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax paused as Bias patted him on the head, a genuine grin on the sage’s scarred face. “Don’t worry, you’ll learn to prioritize when you’re older. Just try to live that long, alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…yeah, okay,” he mumbled, his face slightly red, “Uh, so, what do you need me to do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stick around. You can tell when the Fell Star uses her powers, right? So you’re going to be my canary and sing for me whenever that happens. I’ll adjust the plan accordingly as needed. Understand?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He nodded, hiding a slight wince as his aches protested the movement. “Understood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. How injured are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don't worry about me, I can still provide some back up!” Shax said, trying to put on a big smile even as his body ached. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias just rolled her eyes and waved a hand, a soft glow settling over Shax’s body as he blinked in surprise. “You’ll be better at doing that if you don’t have broken ribs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…yeah, I guess that’s true. I didn’t expect you to heal me though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. I know I’m not as good at it as Pittacus is, but I still know how to cast healing magic,” Bias grumbled, waving off the boy’s words, “Just stay close. You can tell when the Fell Star uses her powers, right? That’ll help me deal with her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, alright! Sure, I can be your bodyguard, Lady Bias!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias rolled her eyes, but decided not to correct the brat. She had better things to focus on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It hadn’t been too long since they last clashed, but the sadistic sage was already looking forward to her next reunion with Byleth Eisner.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Reunions were a funny thing. Byleth was certainly happy to see her father and all her friends and students again after years apart, but also they were currently in the middle of a potential disaster and she was pretty sure all the hugs she was getting were delaying their response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was nice at first, being able to hug her dad, and then as they were moving to the war tent, she was brought into a sweeping hug by Ferdinand. Thankfully it wasn't a long hug since he realized it was a serious situation, but after she was put down Petra came in with a quick hug, as did Marianne. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once again she didn't mind it, but a small part of her did mind getting tackled by Caspar since it sent the two of them sprawling to the ground from the force of the hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she was getting up, she couldn't help but notice Dorothea, the songstress standing at the back of the group. The songstress smiled and raised a hand in greeting, something that Byleth returned, though Dorothea didn’t approach her just yet, for understandable reasons given that Constance had just launched into an excited declaration of just how wonderful it was to see her professor once more. Again, very nice to hear, but perhaps not the right time for it. Still, she soon managed to break away and go up to Dorothea–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Who promptly swept her up into an embrace, dipped her, and kissed her straight on the lips, making the former professor’s eyes go wide as her face went fully crimson for the first time in years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Somebody’s popular,” Shez commented from nearby, amused by her sister’s plight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure is,” Jeralt agreed with a small smile, before glancing at his younger daughter, “How are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, don’t worry, I’m not jealous. I already met up with most of my classmates from both classes, so I can handle Byleth getting fawned over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. That’s not exactly what I meant, kid. It’s been a while since I’ve seen you, and, well…you, both of you, look so different.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…yeah, I guess that’s true.” Shez ran a hand over her altered hair, her warmer, orange-pink locks standing out amidst the purple. “Yeah, I…sort of got possessed back there, those years ago. I had this…evil ghost in me, and I…” She took a small breath. “...I…I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have nothing to be sorry for,” Jeralt stated without hesitation, though his words earned a frown from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do though. I…I know it was Epimenides who did it, but he used my body to send Byleth to that void. I was the whole reason she was gone all this time, and then…ugh, it’s a lot to explain, but I…I could’ve tried to find you earlier, but I didn’t. Because…I don’t know…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were worried you’d hurt me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked, then looked up at Jeralt, who met her gaze with a sad look of his own. “...yeah. I…I mean, like I said, I–It was my body, and he could just…he could take me over, and…a-and it was my fault–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He put a hand on her shoulder, cutting off the recrimination before it could start. “It wasn’t. Of course it wasn’t. You said this Epimenides guy took control of your body. I believe you. I know, no matter what happens, you would never really try to hurt Byleth. You kids have had your ups and downs, but that’s just what being family is like. There's plenty of things I could have done better, but as long as we have each other, it'll be okay.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez didn't say anything, before holding onto him again, pulling her dad into a hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt didn't say a word, simply wrapping one arm around her, comforting his daughter as she cried. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...er, should we say something?” Ferdinand inquired, giving the embracing Eisners an awkward glance before Byleth, now covered in kiss marks and still slightly flushed, shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, let them have a moment. We need to talk about our plans going forward anyways,” she stated while wiping her face clean, ignoring Dorothea’s smug smile while she drew the assembled Eagles’ attention back to the map at the center of the war tent, “To start off, hi everyone, it’s great to see you, I would be very happy to talk to all of you at length later. Right now, we have two very important things to deal with because it turns out the enemy commander was an idiot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“First, here at Fort Merceus, we have whatever remaining enemy forces their are. I don’t know the complete command structure, so I would like to be filled in as soon as possible so we know if killing Dolofonos disrupted their chain of command, or if we need to eliminate another enemy commander. Either way, we have reason to believe that Dolofonos has caused the demonic beasts at the fortress to go berserk. They may attempt to attack the camp, or they may just rampage. We should shore up our defenses either way, but we might have an opportunity to seize Fort Merceus if luck is on our side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“However, I do not believe that should be our priority at the moment. The second issue we face tonight is that the enemy is aiming to burn the city of Mozghuz.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” Linhardt, surprisingly, looked alarmed. “Why would–I realize Mozghuz is a major city, but it’s hardly of strategic importance compared to Merceus or Enbarr. Or even Boramas.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean ‘even’ Boramas?” Ferdinand asked, frowning, earning a sigh from Dorothea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ferdie, it’s really not the time,” she chided, before turning to Byleth, “So, what’s the plan, Professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can answer that,” Edelgard spoke up, somewhat amused that her classmates were deferring to Byleth again already, “I believe the most prudent choice right now is to divide our forces, with myself and the rest of us Eagles forming a strike force to deal with the enemy at Mozghuz before they manage to burn the city. Meanwhile, General Jeralt…ah…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s alright, I get it,” Jeralt said, looking over to the emperor, “You need me here to handle whatever happens with Fort Merceus. Don’t worry, I’ll handle it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, General.” Edelgard nodded to him. “I understand it may be difficult separating this soon–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Believe me, if I didn’t trust you’d bring them back, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.” He could admit, internally, that he wasn’t really that okay with leaving his kids to fight some pyromaniacs right after reuniting with them, but at least he knew they were fine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, so, where am I going then?” Shez spoke up, drawing attention her way, “I know Byleth is going with you guys, there’s no way she wouldn’t, but do you want me coming along or would it be better if I stick here in case some bullshit happens?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, my teacher, what do you advise at this moment? You have a better understanding of Shez’s skills and abilities, so I'll trust your words.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Byleth glanced over at her sister for a moment, before regarding Edelgard, “I believe she'd be best suited here. Aside from the camp needing everyone they can have in case an attack is launched, she'd be able to get a message out quickly if need be. Not to mention that if our forces from the monastery arrived, she'd be able to fill them in properly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Understood, professor.” Edelgard paused. “Hm, I might need to think of a new title for you, now that you’re no longer working for the academy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor is fine,” Byleth replied, “I still like the title. Now then, everyone who knows how to ride wyverns or pegasi, please raise your hands. We’ll need to travel quickly, so anyone who doesn’t, I’ll make sure to teach you later, but for now, please pair up with those of us that do. Edelgard, you’re with me, I want you to nap on the way over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard blinked. “...er, what do you mean, professor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re clearly exhausted, so you’re going to be sleeping while I fly our wyvern towards Mozghuz. Would you prefer to sit behind me or in front of me? Front might be safer since I can keep my arms around you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I… professor, I don't think that would be the best course of action,” Edelgard protested, her face heating up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm,” Byleth looked at her, before glancing at Dorothea for a moment, “If you would be more comfortable with Dorothea instead, that can work as well. I'll just need to ride alongside the two to guide my wyvern if you two aren't skilled at flying.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you think the three of us could sit on the same wyvern?” Dorothea spoke up, starting to grin as Edelgard blushed, “Then we could sit Edie between both of us~”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe? I suppose that's something we can practice for if the case arises in the future,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh I certainly wouldn't mind ‘practicing’ with you two~” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps we can move on to discussing something else,” Edelgard said, her face completely red. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Oh, that was flirting,” Byleth realized. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I should just go myself and leave her here,” Shez mumbled, earning an amused huff from Jeralt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s good to have you two back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh. Glad to be back, dad.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Soon enough, with preparations settled, the Eagles were on their way to Mozghuz. Well, most of them. Unfortunately, Flayn had to remain behind because Seteth was getting very loud about her being in a fight with a dangerous assassin and Marianne offered to remain behind to keep her company. That, and she didn’t really want to leave Dorte behind, and unfortunately her beloved horse happened to be wingless. A shame, but at least most of the class was together for the mission.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Due to the safety issues of having three people on one mount, Byleth rode a pegasus alongside her wyvern while Edelgard and Dorothea sat atop it. She had offered Bernadetta a seat on the pegasus with her, but the archer didn't seem to want to be near a pegasus at the moment with how panicked she’d been after the sisters had left her alone on one. A shame, but at least she’d consented to riding with Petra on her wyvern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regardless, Byleth was happy to have some time with the two, even if Edelgard had quickly fallen asleep thanks to Dorothea’s gentle singing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have to say, it almost feels like we're back at the academy. Just going on one of our usual missions with our professor guiding us,” Dorothea noted as she held onto the sleeping Emperor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It does feel nice to be back, even if things have changed,” Byleth replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of, do you mind explaining why your hair changed colors? I’m not against it, but I am curious.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'll go more into detail when Edelgard is awake, but long story short, I was stuck in the void and I might be a dragon now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Dorothea blinked as she stared at Byleth, before letting out a laugh, “You certainly lead an interesting life, Bylie. I can already see the countless operas made in your honor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Never thought of that, but I suppose it would be interesting,” Byleth muttered, before she glanced at Dorothea, who smiled back at her, “...I'm sorry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? For what?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your smile. It's not as bright,” Byleth said as she looked down at the reins of the pegasus she was on, “I didn't have the option, but…I wasn't here for any of you for three years.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re right, you didn’t have the option,” Dorothea replied, giving her professor a wry smile, “I’m not going to blame you for being gone, Bylie. I’m just happy you’re back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you. I do find it strange everyone keeps saying that though. I thought at least one person would be upset with me for disappearing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re difficult to be upset with, Bylie, and besides, I don’t think anyone here is cruel enough to blame you for what happened. Sure, we were upset, but not with you. Not after everything you did to make sure all of us were safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth smiled. “I’m glad you’re all okay. If you’d been hurt before I could get here…I don’t know what I would’ve done.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bylie, that’s sweet to hear, but please stop talking about us being injured for a little bit, okay? I don’t know if you remember, but I’m not exactly proficient at riding any sort of steed and I think if you make me nervous, our scaly friend here is going to sense weakness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need to worry about that. Blade will be a good wyvern and not cause any problems. Right, Blade?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorothea wasn’t sure, but it sounded like the wyvern chirped in response. Though her mind couldn’t help but focus on something else Byleth said. “‘Blade’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm hm. I named him for a fat dragon Rhea stole from me. The ‘Unfaltering Blade of Devotion’.” Byleth glanced over at Dorothea. “Hubert loaned him to me so that’s why I thought of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm. Hm.” Dorothea nodded and decided to just leave things there for now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I need to name the wyvern I got from Claude.” Byleth, meanwhile, was still focused on the previous topic. “Hm…well if this one is Blade…Bow, maybe?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You certainly have a very direct naming sense. Oh, speaking of, you'll be happy to hear we have Snappy back at Edelgard’s palace, safe and sound,” Dorothea said, pausing as she heard Byleth let out a happy gasp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, if I knew you had him, I would have visited the castle. I’ll need to say hi after–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“INCOMING!” Caspar suddenly shouted. Understandably so, given there was a giant fireball flying directly towards their formation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“EVASIVE MANEUVERS EVERYONE!” Ferdinand added, and the Eagles promptly scattered to avoid the unexpected attack.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Geh–Ah, E-Edie, it’s time to wake–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m awake,” Edelgard interrupted, taking the reins from Dorothea and promptly urging the wyvern downward, “EVERYONE, TO THE GROUND! WE’LL MAKE THE REST OF THE JOURNEY ON FOOT!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“WATCH THE TREES, THERE MIGHT BE AN AMBUSH!” Byleth shouted as well, as she dove down, scanning the area in search for attackers. She couldn't help but frown at the lack of visibility the night gave her, but it did make her question something. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They had been traveling for some time, and they still hadn't spotted a burning city yet. Furthermore, how had the enemy been able to set up an ambush? It implied they knew ahead of time–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Shax warped away before we could finish him off,</span>
  </em>
  <span> she realized, a frown coming to her face, </span>
  <em>
    <span>He must have gone to Bias to let her know we were coming. Did she call off her mission to hunt us instead?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It would fit with what Byleth knew of the vengeful sorceress. Which meant her students were absolutely in danger right now. There was a sharp difference between taking on an enemy that didn’t know they were coming and strolling straight into an ambush. One as sharp as the arrow that just plunged into her steed’s throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Damn–!” Byleth cursed as the arrow managed to catch the pegasus right in a lethal spot, the poor beast immediately dropping out of the sky before she managed to wind back time and keep the wound from even happening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead, she urged her steed lower than before and leapt off of it when they were close to the ground. The moment her feet touched the dirt, she rushed off into the woods, searching for any hint of her foes. She heard a slight rustling coming from the direction the arrow had come from, and with a flick of her wrist, her sword extended out, stabbing into a bush right as another arrow flew out, grazing her cheek. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Retracting her blade, she flicked the blood off it before pressing up against a tree, taking over while searching for more foes. She could hear more arrows loosed on the breeze and glanced skyward, checking to make sure none of her students were hit. No sudden impacts, but she felt a small frown come up when she noticed there were wyvern riders in black flying to intercept those students that were still in the air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her mind raced, deciding on if she should focus on keeping her students safe or moving towards the objective when she heard a rustle of movement in the brush. A glance to the side showed knights in black armor on the prowl, their pitch-black plate ironically making them stand out even in the darkness. They held halberds in hand, the points aimed outwards as they swept the forest for Byleth and her students.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So of course Byleth swung her blade into the first one that got close, slashing the knight’s head clean from their shoulders before rushing in to take advantage of the close quarters. Normally a lone swordswoman against a squad of knights with polearms would be at a disadvantage, but the Sword of the Creator gave a lot more reach and Byleth was perfectly fine with employing Thunder spells where applicable. And she wasn’t the only one.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lightning split the sky over the woods and Byleth turned her gaze towards the second source of thunder, briefly wondering which of her students was letting loose with the electrifying spells, before a sudden light caught her attention. A bright, orange light, which was rapidly approaching in the form of a truly massive conflagration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth dove to the side, rolling to her feet and running the instant the woods were set alight. The flames spread rapidly behind her, the dark forest turning to a raging inferno within seconds as several points in the woods suddenly erupted into flames. Briefly, she felt a surge of concern for her students, but she buried that fear for their safety under the immediate need for self-preservation as she sprinted her way towards the source of the fireball. After all, she already knew Bias was involved here, so any huge flames lighting up the night had to be coming from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sure enough, the instant Byleth broke through the treeline and her foot touched the grass of the surrounding plains, her eyes immediately locked on the familiar sight of the Agarthan Sage of Fire. The ruby-colored artificial crest stones affixed to her jewelry gleamed in the night, illuminating Bias’s scarred, smirking face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Byleth Eisner. There you are.” Her smile widened, scarred skin stretching. “I was wondering when I’d get to see you again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Call off your men,” Byleth ordered, unamused and unwilling to play along. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh please, as if they'd listen to me at this point." Bias sighed, pretending to be put out. “Those bloodthirsty fools had been raring to go slaughter the beasts in that city for hours by the time I told them we had a change of plans. You should’ve seen how much they were pouting over having to turn away, and it was only by promising them that they could butcher whatever battalion you brought along with you that I kept them from going rushing off on a murder spree. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really, you should be thanking me for redirecting their attention. Now they’ll focus on beasts that can actually fight back.” Bias paused as a roar sounded out and the woods lit up with even more flames. “Speaking of beasts, which do you think have better chances here? My monsters, or whatever wretches you managed to scrape together?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know my students are better than your troops. I have faith in them.” Byleth stepped forward, her sword in hand as she frowned at the scarred sage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh please, faith has nothing to do with reality. Both of us know even if my forces were to win, you'd just rewind time to fix your wretches’ mistakes. Who knows, maybe you've already seen them get torn to bits a few times already?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t,” Byleth bluntly stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That brought a frown to the sage’s face. “You’re serious, huh? That’s annoying. I thought these peons could at least kill off a few of them…well, whatever. At least this way I’ll get the satisfaction of burning you all to the bone by myself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth frowned as fire began to collect in Bias’ hands, well aware that she'd need to keep her focus on the Agarthan. Even if she wanted to make sure her students were safe, Bias knew her well enough to be able to catch even a slight moment of distraction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With a flick of her wrist, Bias sent a fire spell towards Byleth, which was easily blocked. Before she could begin to question the weak spell, the former mercenary quickly had to move as a barrage of fire came her way, as the Agarthan seemed to try and overwhelm her with quantity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I must admit, before I had to deal with you, I wasn't much for tactics. Why bother myself with trying to come up with some ingenious plan when I can just set my enemies alight?” Bias mused, as she continued to launch spells that Byleth deflected or dodged. “Of course, it's not that simple when your opponent can control time, meaning I had to get a bit tricky. I suppose you only have yourself to thank for this.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth blinked as a fireball shot right past her, going straight into the bushes and colliding with a barrel she hadn’t seen– </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A searing heat crashed into her back for a brief moment as the sound of an explosion rang out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the next moment, Byleth had returned to just a few seconds prior, blocking the fireball meant for the explosive, before quickly rolling away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It truly is a shame that I can't experience the memories of the time you erased. There are so many excruciating moments I wish I could revel in.” Bias sighed fondly with a genuine smile. “Ah well. At least I can enjoy knowing you did suffer. That, and I might as well go all in now that you know.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth’s eyes widened in alarm as wheels of flames gathered at Bias’s hands. She quickly sprinted towards the sage, extending her sword and swinging it in an arc meant to catch her across the neck, only for the swing to suddenly jerk to a stop when it met it’s dark counterpart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, sorry Fell Star, but I’m not letting you kill Miss Bias too,” Shax stated with a smug grin, making Byleth frown in annoyance, “It wouldn’t look good for me if I let two superiors die in one night, you know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth didn’t reply. Instead, she rushed forward, intent on locking blades with Shez’s distorted reflection–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Back.” The order came suddenly, unexpectedly, and Byleth’s eyes widened as Shax abruptly vanished into shadow, leaving her with barely a second to freeze time in an attempt to escape the plume of flame before it washed over her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second the world went gray, Byleth leapt out of the way and rolled to her feet–Only to have to block Shax’s blade before it could cut into her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t forget, I can’t do the same tricks as you, but I sure as hell can counter them,” he taunted, before looking back right as time resumed, “OVER HERE!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the next second, he vanished again and Byleth dropped to the ground, narrowly avoiding the flames erupting above her back. She grimaced at the sheer heat, keeping as low as she could to avoid her clothing catching aflame. Fighting these two on her own was going to be difficult…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fortunately for the professor, she wasn’t alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The only warning Bias received was the slightest glint of light in the middle of the night, caused by the glow of her firestorm reflecting off the axe blade that nearly took her arm off. The flames cut out entirely when she pulled her hand back, though it was still plenty bright enough to see the blue-haired man swinging straight for her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His blow bounced off a hastily erected barrier that was stabbed through seconds later as the scion of House Aegir joined his comrade from Bergliez in a flurry of strikes that would have broken through the sage’s defenses, were it not for Shax leaping to her aid. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Caspar, next time do not leap from your wyvern to join the battle!” Ferdinand reprimanded in between stabbing at gaps in the Agarthan swordsman’s defenses.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, you jumped off yours too! How else did you get down here so fast?!” Caspar retorted, using his axe to deflect any return attacks whenever Ferdinand overextended.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh, so I did!” Ferdinand admitted with a laugh, “It seems I moved so quickly, I scarcely even thought my actions through!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I really need to stop those two from pairing up,” Linhardt murmured as he extended a hand towards Byleth, who felt a rush of cool light magic soothing her burns.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They actually cover for each other pretty well,” Byleth noted, before glancing at Lin, “How is everyone else doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Last I saw, our trio of witches were trying to broil a demonic beast.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…witches?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dorothea, Constance, and Hapi. I suppose you could count Hubert as witch-adjacent, but he isn't here right now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. What about Marianne and Flayn?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can’t seriously tell me you would count those two as ‘witches’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Yeah, that’s fair….what about Edelgard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I feel like being the Emperor puts her above a regular witch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. A witchperor…wait, did you see her and the others back in the woods? Are they doing okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Linhardt paused as the head of a demonic beast abruptly sailed over the treeline and crashed into the ground nearby. “...I think they’re doing fine, professor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth nodded, before pushing herself up to rush towards Shax. The purple-haired man couldn't help but scowl as he locked blades with Byleth, his eyes flicking towards Bias.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This isn't going to end well if you don't back down now,” Byleth said, keeping her eyes on the Agarthan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As if it would end well even if we surrender,” Shax responded, a half-hearted grin on his face, “The least I can do is make sure you lose out as well.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What–?” Byleth found herself stumbling forward as Shax suddenly moved backwards. The next moment she took to right herself quickly turned into one of horror as he saw him twist around, throwing his sword at Ferdinand, the noble’s back turned to them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth reversed time right as the Sword pierced through the noble. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ferdinand, dodge!” Byleth shouted, the noble moving to the side without question as the sword flew past him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax vanished a moment later, grabbing the sword and turning with a swing at Ferdinand’s head, only for Caspar to copy the Agarthan and throw his axe straight at him, forcing Shax to block. Bias attempted to take advantage of the confusion, aiming a Ragnarok at Caspar, only to hiss in pain as an arrow pierced into her palm. She whirled, shooting a furious glare at Bernadetta, who, very admirably, did her best not to cry in fear while nocking another arrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax scowled furiously at the sight of Bias’s wound, but had to focus on dodging another stab from Ferdinand. He swung, breaking through the noble’s spear, only for Ferdinand to immediately draw the sword at his side and keep on swinging.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ve got to be kidding–!” Shax snarled, right before Caspar buried his fist into his side. The Agarthan choked, flying across the field and crashing on the ground, before rolling to his feet. Blood leaked from his lips as his eyes flared red, an orange glow burning around his body. “THAT’S IT! I’M GOING TO RIP ALL OF YOU LIMB FROM–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t get to finish his threat, in large part because Petra, unbeknownst to him, had been moving through the grass right behind him, and in one swift motion grabbed the Agarthan’s head and slashed his throat. Blood sprayed through the air as Shax’s eyes widened and he audibly choked, before warping while clutching his neck. He flashed across the field multiple times, stumbling and choking, then abruptly fell beside Bias, wheezing and struggling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Bias, surrounded on all sides by enemies, with the object of her hatred right in front of her with a sword in hand, ripped the arrow free from her palm and burned the wound closed. Her eyes flicked towards Byleth, meeting her gaze. The air seemed to still, quiet aside from the crackle of flames and the pained choking of the dying boy at her side, orange light flaring around his body with the effort of keeping himself alive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She should have gone all out from the start. Just burned him to ash along with the Fell Star and her filthy pets. It would have been the smart decision. Now she had the beasts baying for blood all around her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She weighed her options, thinking quickly, then paused when she saw the Emperor stride out from the burning forest. Black blood steamed off her shining axe, its blade burning with her own blazing flames.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard looked more like a goddess than the Fell Star did. Vicious, wrathful, and vengeful towards any slight. The type of god the Agarthan people once worshipped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sight brought a small smile to Bias’s face. “Damn. It’s a shame we never got to really work together, majesty. It could've been great.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lay down your arms and surrender, Bias,” Edelgard ordered, glaring straight at the sage of flame, “You have nowhere to go and no chance of completing your mission. You will not harm any citizen of Adrestia tonight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could still kill all of you,” Bias pointed out, simply shrugging her shoulders, “As for surrendering…You know I can’t.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why not?” Byleth asked, stepping forward with a frown, “You don’t need to throw your life away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re asking me that? You…” Whatever fury that might have built up inside of Bias sputtered out abruptly, her usual rage failing her. “...I have more reasons to hate you than any other Agarthan. They all hate you in the abstract. You though…you took my sister from me.” She laughed then, bitter and tired as she looked from one god to another. “You understand. Right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do,” Edelgard agreed, “Regardless, I will not allow you to harm Byleth in your misguided quest for vengeance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Misguided, huh? Easy for you to say. You killed Chilon, didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed. I offered to let him go, however, if he could remember a single one of my sibling’s names.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? You did that? Huh.” She tilted her head. “You’re telling the truth too…Well, how about it, Byleth Eisner?” She turned her gaze towards the Fell Star. “What is my sister’s name?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pittacus,” Byleth answered without hesitation, her guard still up. Though it faltered slightly when she saw Bias blink, genuinely surprised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...well, I’ll be damned.” The sage let out a sigh, then glanced down. Shax was weakening beside her feet, his regenerative properties unable to keep up with the mortal wound he was barely able to breathe through. He’d likely die in the next minute, at most. “...” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias closed her eyes, then looked up at Byleth, who paused at the look of exhaustion in the Agarthan’s gaze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t stop now,” she simply stated, before magic began to gather at her hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth and Edelgard rushed forward, followed by Ferdinand, Caspar, and Petra while Bernie let her arrow fly and even Linhardt let loose a Cutting Gale. They didn’t get there in time though as Bias extended her hand and cast Recover on Shax.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The young Agarthan gasped as his throat closed back up, his wound mended in seconds, before he looked up to meet the sage’s gaze. She gave him a small smile, then turned as every jewel on her body gleamed with a crimson light, calling upon the strongest flame magic she could possibly manifest: a Meteor Swarm, same as the one that devastated Garreg Mach all those years ago.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yet she didn’t get a chance to cast it. In one swift motion, Edelgard von Hresvelg swung her axe to smash through the barrier the sage had conjured, just in time for her professor to swing her sword in a swift, vertical arc, splitting through the circlet on Bias’s head. The Sword of the Creator cleaved through the artificial crest stone, and in an instant, everyone present was blasted back by the force that erupted from the sage’s forehead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Byleth flew back, though she suddenly skidded to a stop thanks to Edelgard, who kept her arms tight around her professor as she arrested her movement. She glanced back at her student for a moment, grateful for the save, before immediately looking back towards Bias, who still stood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sage stared upwards into the night, blood leaking from the fragments of stone embedded in her head and flowing from her eyes in a disturbing mockery of tears. Yet the expression on Bias’s face was not one of sorrow, but of pained relief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“NO!” Shax felt no such relief though, his expression twisted in a moment of shock and horror before he stumbled towards Bias, trying and failing to find his feet. Desperate, he warped closer and wrapped his arms tightly around her, barely able to stand under his own power. Even still, he managed to shoot a truly hateful glare towards Byleth before abruptly vanishing with Bias, the pair disappearing from the field entirely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...uh…did we just win?” Caspar asked, turning towards Byleth with a confused look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think so,” Byleth replied, getting back up and helping Edelgard to her feet, “Is everyone okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing that Marianne and Lindhart can't handle, professor!” Ferdinand said, a smile on his face as Dorothea walked over and healed a cut on his head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You do remember they're not the only healers, right?” Dorothea asked, letting out an amused huff as Hapi and Constance followed her out from the woods. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I suppose we should consider ourselves lucky that Bias’ grudge made her forget her mission,” Edelgard stated, before stumbling slightly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay?” Byleth asked, holding onto the emperor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I'm just starting to realize that I might actually need to sleep,” Edelgard said, plainly struggling to stay awake now that the adrenaline was leaving her body. “Hm. Byleth, don’t tell Hubert about this, please.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then she promptly slumps in Byleth’s arms with a sleepy mumble.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, congrats Bylie, it took me sometime for her to feel comfortable enough to sleep in my arms, yet here you are only a day back and she's already sleeping in yours,” Dorothea teased, having walked over after checking on Ferdinand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Do you want to sleep in my arms as well?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Come now Bylie, at least wait till we have some privacy. Though I certainly am willing to take you up on that offer~.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, good. I’ve been wanting to cuddle for three years now and I would really love to just get to that,” Byleth replied, unashamed, though she paused after a moment. “Hm. Hopefully things are going okay with Shez…”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Fort Merceus, otherwise known as the Stubborn Old General, was easily Adrestia’s most famous fortress city. It was the capital of Bergliez territory and arguably one of the cornerstones of the entire nation, serving as Enbarr’s greatest bulwark against potential invasions, a role that kept it regarded as the Empire’s most stalwart defender. It would also have been one of two famous forts if the Rowes hadn’t stolen Arianrhod, but that was ancient history that nobody reasonably would still be angry at and thus was irrelevant to the current situation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for what that situation was, the simplest way to describe it was a fracas. A clash, a skirmish, or even a tussle could also be appropriate words, all owing to the fact that a poorly thought out plan on the part of the upjumped Agarthan Dolofonos, who really hadn’t warranted the sage title he held, led to the entire fort being overrun by demonic beasts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for how that happened, the simplest explanation was that the Agarthans weren’t as smart as they thought they were. The idea behind the Demon Lure, otherwise known as the magic flute they made, was to replicate the ability of a former test subject to summon demonic beasts in order to swarm their enemies with overwhelming force. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately for the Agarthans, they failed to understand a core aspect of the test subject’s ability: When Hapi sighs, her crest quite literally summons the nearest demonic beast, in some cases outright warping a beast to be closer in order to respond properly to what they interpret as a call for aid from one of their own kind. The flute lacked that aspect, and instead only worked by calling the </span>
  <em>
    <span>nearest</span>
  </em>
  <span> demonic beasts. And while that was very effective at Zanado, where the beasts that had populated the lands surrounding Garreg Mach eagerly heeded its call, it was less effective at Fort Merceus, where the beasts were being kept inside specific stables.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Said stables were now shattered, and the beasts were gladly ripping through the garrison that once held them. Including the mechanical Titanii, which were doing their best to hold firm against an onslaught of demonic claws and teeth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alas, their efforts would prove futile as the nearby forces of the Empire and the Reclaimers besieged the gates and broke straight through in the midst of the chaos. Agarthan commanders soon found their heads leaving their shoulders as a certain shadow flashed through the fort, swinging her swords with practiced precision to cause even more chaos while her father led a charge of armored knights to pierce into the hides of the enemy beasts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Screeches and cries filled the air as wyverns swooped from the night sky and drove their claws into the scaley hides while their riders drove axes and spears into vulnerable necks. Seteth led from the front there, calling for no quarter to be given to the traitors and sorcerers that held the city.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Elsewhere in the fort, Jeralt grit his teeth irritably as the order passed around, his lance buried deep in the sparking innards of a Titanus. He pulled it free as the machine collapsed, bleeding lightning, and called instead for the garrison’s remaining troops to surrender.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, the first order had already spread, and the desperate garrison fought to their last, convinced only death awaited them at their enemy’s hands. A fear that became a premonition as the remainder of the night was spent on an exhausting slaughter, until finally some desperate soldiers of the principality laid down their arms for a chance at survival.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One Jeral granted, though he had to actively stop the Reclaimers from butchering the surrendering soldiers. Suffice to say, even after the fort was fully reclaimed by the allied armies, tempers were high in the war room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You cannot give my soldiers orders, Captain Jeralt!” Seteth complained, frowning at the Imperial Army’s leader, “You left the knights, they are not under your command!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s general, Seteth,” Jeralt replied, deeply unimpressed, “And I’ll give orders when I need to. Like when your troops are about to execute unarmed prisoners.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re traitors and Agarthans, </span>
  <em>
    <span>General</span>
  </em>
  <span>. We cannot afford to take prisoners, not when they stand against everything the church was built to protect!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Even war has rules. If there’s a chance to end the fight early and avoid the slog of killing everyone on the enemy’s side, we should take it. Otherwise, we have to spend hours hunting troops that have hunkered down and won’t give up because it means certain death, just like we did tonight because of your orders.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seteth scowled. “Agarthans don’t surrender, Jeralt. Their own soldiers would sooner kill a commander that gave that order than give themselves up to be captured.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well one did, and it saved us a hell of a lot more fighting when she got her troops to stand down. So we’re going to treat her the way we’d treat any captured commander and keep her as a prisoner of the Empire. And if you and your knights try to execute her or anyone else we captured, we’re going to have problems.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The two men glared at one another, the air thick with tension while, nearby, Shez and Flayn watched from atop a set of boxes they were using for seats. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Man, your dad gets aggressive when it comes to war,” Shez remarked, idly cleaning her swords while watching the argument.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think the years may have worn him down,” Flayn replied, frowning sadly, “He has had to fight without anyone at his side for so long…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about Cyril? Or those cardinal guys?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn paused, her cheeks turning slightly pink. “Oh. I forgot about Cyril…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t he like your dad’s squire or something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-I haven’t seen either of them in ages! It wasn’t as though I deliberately forgot…” she mumbled with a pout, earning a chuckle from Shez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about it, I’m sure he won’t mind–Oh hey, speak of Cyril and he appears,” Shez remarked as the door opened and Cyril walked in along with Marianne.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tanned teen raised an eyebrow at Shez, but ignored her in favor of heading over to Seteth. “I spread the news, everyone should be ready to go in another hour.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Go?” Jeralt asked before Seteth could respond, “What do you mean? You’re planning on leaving?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seteth grimaced as Jeralt gave him a skeptical look, but nodded. “The Empire has more than enough troops to hold Fort Merceus. The Knights of Reclamation, however, have a duty to return to the church and aid Lady Rhea in this time of crisis, now that we know she’s returned. I am sorry to leave so suddenly, but we can hardly stay here when the Church of Seiros needs us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seriously?” Shez spoke up, frowning, “You’re leaving just like that? You know Rhea’s probably going to want to help the Empire anyway, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would prefer to make sure of that myself, Shez. Besides, it would be safer for Flayn to return to the monastery–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going,” Flayn promptly stated, frowning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seteth sighed. “Flayn, I know you have friends in the Empire, but–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Father, no, I–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Flayn, you misspoke. You meant ‘brother’–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I meant</span>
  <em>
    <span> Father</span>
  </em>
  <span>, because everyone already knows I am your daughter, not your sister, and I cannot go with you because I have responsibilities here!” Flayn argued, “I am the bishop of the Southern Church, I cannot abandon my duties just because it is not safe in wartime!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That–Flayn, you can’t–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And how is the monastery safer anyway?! The war started with it being invaded and burned! I know I am not a grown woman by your standards, Father, but I have duties and responsibilities of my own that I cannot overlook purely because you are worried for me. If you leave, I am not going with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…” Seteth just stared silently, his mouth agape as he tried to think of something to say. “…but…you’re not safe here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn let out a loud, exasperated sigh there, earning a chuckle from Shez, who hopped off her perch and grinned at the shorter girl, “Nice work speaking your mind there, Flayn. How about we take a walk before your dad says anything too stupid?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph…I would quite prefer that. Marianne, are you coming with us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sorry, I was actually just here to report to General Jeralt,” Marianne explained, nodding to Shez’s father, “I have a tally of the battle’s casualties from Miss Gertrude, sir, including injuries and fatalities.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, thanks for that,” Jeralt replied, “Though you could probably save that for later. I think Seteth and I need to have a…let’s call it a fatherly chat, parent to parent.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gross,” Shez said, “Anyway, sounds like you’re free, Mari, so c’mon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, alright.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cyril watched the three ladies head out, then turned his gaze back to Seteth, who still seemed at a loss for words, and Jeralt, who was giving the chamberlain a much more sympathetic look. “Hm. I still vote that we go to Lady Rhea as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, as the pair of dads began to commiserate over the difficulty in keeping their children safe, Shez glanced at Flayn as they walked along the largely intact ramparts of the fort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, you really aren’t an adult by Seteth’s standards?” she asked, a little curious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph. I doubt my father would see me as an adult even if I grew taller than him,” Flayn huffed, pouting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fathers can certainly be protective in their own way,” Marianne noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, how are things going with your dad, Marianne? I mean, I know he's over in the Alliance, but have you stayed in contact?” Shez asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Only recently. I know he wishes for me to return to the Alliance, but I don't have any intention of doing so. Not until the war is over at least,” Marianne responded, before letting out a breath, “It's interesting. This time away from him has actually made me think of my adoptive father in a new light. At the very least, we're certainly in for a long talk once everything has been settled.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I can get that. I know I definitely want to talk with By and Dad more once things get settled…hey actually, Flayn, you mind if I ask you some…well, personal questions?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, er…what type of personal questions?” Flayn asked, giving Shez a questioning look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, the type that relates to, uh…your and By’s side of the family.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marianne blinked. “Byleth is related to you, Flayn?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“O-Oh, well, ah…sort of? Not exactly, it, um…we’re cousins!” Flayn decided to say, “And being cousins, we have family things in common so yes, we should probably talk about those things in a more private area! Um, thank you for walking with us Marianne but you can go now, bye!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With that, Flayn promptly took Shez by the hand and pulled her away, earning a blink from Marianne. “Oh. Um…alright then…” She turned and began to walk away, frowning to herself. “Why did they ask me on a walk if they were just going to run off…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Shez let herself get dragged along as Flayn scurried away, a little surprised at how strong the short girl’s grip actually was. Still, she pretty easily pulled Flayn to a stop once they got up to the fort’s ramparts, making the Nabatean squeak as she was abruptly halted in her tracks by the much stronger mercenary. “Okay, I think this is private enough. We can’t exactly go much further unless you want to perch on a roof or something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn blinked. “Um…Shez, I don’t perch on things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I know, that’s something I do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Huh, I suppose I do recall you having a tendency to ‘perch’ on things…ah, wait, never mind that! Shez, you need to be more subtle! Not everyone knows about the, er…you know!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The fact that you and every other person with green hair is apparently a dragon person?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! That! Though also, no, not exactly! Linhardt isn’t, I checked!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez raised an eyebrow. “How?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No pointed ears! That is a consistent quality we Nabateans have–Ah, wait, I said it outloud…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So I’m guessing that means you haven’t told anyone about being a Naba-thingy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I did tell Edelgard, actually. She even knows about, um…w-well, she knows everything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like you being one of the saints,” Shez noted, nodding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, so you know that part too…well, yes. So…ah, right, you wished to ask me a personal question, correct?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well, not anything specific. More so just…well, what exactly does being a Nabatean mean? You can change forms, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…not exactly. I could, but I lost that ability long ago. Maybe one day I'll be able to regain it, but until then, I'm stuck like this, much like my father,” Flayn explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And that happened because of that war a thousand years ago, right? Against what’s-his-face?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nemesis, and yes. Though I suppose it could be worse. If I had been stuck in my other form, then I would never have been able to befriend all of you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez shared a smile with Flayn there, before crossing her arms over her chest. “That’s a shame though. It’s good you didn’t get stuck as a dragon, but it would be pretty convenient to have another one around right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well…I might, maybe, have an idea for how to, um…fix my condition?” Flayn said a little hesitantly, fidgeting slightly with her sleeves. When Shez gave her a confused look, she smiled awkwardly. “Um, so, do you remember that man that tried to kill Edelgard?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shax? Or the weirdo with the flute?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, the second one. And that flute is actually what I wanted to bring up,” Flayn explained as she fished around her robes, before pulling the flute in question out from her sleeve where she’d been hiding it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hang on, you took it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-Well it’s not like Dolofonos is going to use it now…it’s just, when he did use it, I could feel this strange energy in my body, so, um…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She wants to use the flute to regain her draconic form,” Arval explained for Shez, looking curiously at the flute in question as they floated beside their partner, “It does seem to carry some transformative properties for individuals with Nabatean blood…though I would advise against trying to use it outside of a controlled environment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, yeah, that would probably be bad,” Shez remarked, before pausing at Flayn’s confused look, “I mean blowing the flute without preparing ahead of time would probably be a bad idea. It’s made to call demonic beasts, right? So we’d have to make sure the area’s clear first, and we don’t know the range it has either.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“M-Mm…I realize there are concerns, but…it could benefit us a great deal, couldn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe? I'm not exactly sure about how that'd work…oh hey, quick question, why would Seteth think you're still a kid if you had kids yourself?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What? Shez, I don't have any children!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then how are there a bunch of people with your crest running around?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That's because I granted them my blood! It's the same with my father and Lady Rhea!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, really?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, how else do you think your father has a crest of Seiros? Lady Rhea likely granted him some of her blood,” Flayn said, letting out a huff as she calmed down, “Nabateans can grant someone a crest by offering them their blood, and it's usually only done to those they are very close to. It essentially bonds the two together.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so like a marriage–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not like a marriage! Like an adoption! Those are two very different things!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so you do have kids?”</span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>“No! Not–You can adopt a person as family without them necessarily being your child, okay? Do you understand?” Flayn asked, getting a bit frustrated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, not really–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your sister adopted you as her sister,” Arval spoke up, making Shez pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ohh, like that…yeah, okay, I get it. So you have siblings then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Flayn started to rub her temples. “...I am being messed with. You are messing with me, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe a little bit,” Shez replied, admitting nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, well if the Professor gave Dorothea her crest, would you call them sisters?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so it </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> a marriage thing–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut up, please,” Flayn requested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heh, alright, shutting up–Oh, huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn sighed, looking up at the taller girl as she stared off into the distance. “What is it now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…not sure if I should say, you did just ask me to shut up–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, you are my friend and I care for you, but you are being as annoying as my father right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, okay, I’ll cut it out.” She raised a hand and pointed out into the distant horizon. “We’ve got a dragon coming this way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rather than say anything further, Flayn just turned around to look in the direction indicated. “...huh. Huh. That’s Lady–Uh, I mean, it’s the Immaculate One! The holy dragon sent by the goddess–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah I already know it’s Rhea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh…please don’t tell anyone else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s not keeping it a secret. I’m pretty sure all the Deer know already at this point, maybe the Lions too, and I’m sure Edelgard knows already.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, yes, she does, but–Wait, why is Lady Rhea coming here?” Flayn asked, abruptly realizing that it was very weird indeed for the archbishop to not only leave the monastery, but to do so in dragon form.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If I had to guess, she’s probably pissed off that I warped away to Enbarr in the middle of a conversation with her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…” Flayn turned to stare at Shez. “…why would you do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sometimes I just do stuff without thinking about it. It’s a problem,” she admitted with a shrug, “Anyways, we should probably tell your dad that Rhea’s visiting. And probably let the rest of the fort know so they don’t think we’re being invaded by some sort of fancy demonic beast.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flayn was about to say she didn’t think anyone would mistake Rhea for a demonic beast, before she considered how scary the Immaculate One could look to humans and how the soldiers in the fort had already been fighting demonic beasts all night. “Hm…yes, let’s do that.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Luckily, there wasn’t a panic when an enormous dragon landed within the courtyard of Fort Merceus, though there were a whole lot of shocked gasps when the gathered troops saw that dragon turn into the archbishop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, yes, I was blessed by the goddess, it’s very impressive,” Rhea said, waving off the stunned looks while a number of wyvern and pegasi landed nearby, carrying with them some very familiar faces, “Now where is Byleth?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s on a date with Edelgard and Dorothea at some city called Mozghuz,” Shez quite helpfully answered from beside Rhea, earning a startled noise from Catherine at her sudden appearance and an exasperated sigh from the archbishop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shez, what is she actually–Oh, hello Flayn.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Lady Rhea!” Flayn greeted with a smile and a curtsy, prompting a smile in turn from Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s good to see you are well. Perhaps you could be more helpful than Shez?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I’m plenty helpful!” Shez complained while Flayn paused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Um…the thing is, Lady Rhea, Shez wasn’t entirely inaccurate? Byleth really did go to Mozghuz with Edelgard and Dorothea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Hm. Why in the world would she go to–?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“LADY RHEA!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea tried not to sigh at the shouts, instead turning to greet an alarmed Seteth and some very flustered Knights of Reclamation alongside an equally exasperated Jeralt. Meanwhile, Shez glanced over at the archbishop’s retinue, noting who decided to come along on her trip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey Mercedes, hey Alois,” she greeted, smiling at the blonde and her honorary uncle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Greetings Shez! I hope our sudden arrival isn't a drag-on the resources!” Alois greeted with a large smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello there Shez, you may want to move,” Mercedes greeted, getting Shez to blink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, what–” Shez received an answer before she could finish asking, thanks to the sudden kick she felt slamming into her side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why the hell did you just leave without saying a word!?” Kronya yelled, glaring down at Shez while she tried to recover. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“K-Kronya?! Okay, look, I know–” And once again Shez was cut off, this time by a book as Lysithea smacked her over the head with a hefty tome. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“IDIOT! What in the world made you think it was okay to rush off into a war front on your own!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–W-Wait, I wasn’t on my own, I brought Byleth with me!” Shez tried to explain, but neither glaring girl seemed to appreciate her excuse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You damned moron!” Kronya growled, her tails bristling, before she paused when she noticed Flayn staring at her with wide eyes. “Oh, hey, Lys, the other shorty is here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I AM NOT THAT SHORT–Wait, who do you mean–Oh, Flayn. Hello.” Lysithea nodded to Flayn, who stammered out a baffled “hello?” before she turned back to Shez. “Honestly, did you even think of how worried you made us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, uh…n-no? Not really?” Shez winced at the immediate glares she received for that answer. “S-Sorry! I just didn’t think at all! I know it was dumb, but it just made sense to warp in the moment and I didn’t think…sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Lysithea sighed at Shez’s contrite expression before crouching down to look her in the eyes. “I suppose I can forgive you…but you have to promise me you won’t run off without telling us again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, okay, sure, you got it. I promise I won’t run off again,” Shez says, sitting up with a sigh and rubbing her head. “I really am sorry I worried you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph…I didn’t hit you too hard, did I? I didn’t want to actually hurt you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did,” Kronya said with a huff, “Couldn’t even bring me along for the fight, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t know there’d be a fight!” Shez protested as she stood up, “Besides, if I did bring you, you’d probably wind up as the prime minister somehow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I–...wait, could I do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea immediately frowned. “Kronya. No.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold on pipsqueak, I just had an idea,” Kronya said, before taking a lock of her hair and holding it up, “Does this look like it’s the same shade as Ferdinand’s hair?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now Lysithea looked alarmed. “Kronya, what in the world are you thinking?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look, it’s simple. I pretend I’m Duke Aegir’s bastard daughter–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kronya–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–and I get Ferd to abdicate so I’m the only valid candidate–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kronya, </span>
  <em>
    <span>no–“</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–and then I use my marriage with Shez as leverage to get Edelgard to make me emperor!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>How is that even supposed to work?!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“IS THAT AN AGARTHAN?!” Seteth yelped before Kronya could elaborate on her brilliant plan, earning a deep sigh from Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, that’s Kronya, she’s the Duke of Riegan and Shez’s fiancé. Now can we please stay on topic?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s Shez’s what now?” Jeralt asked, visibly alarmed, which elicited an even deeper sigh from Rhea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please, just, talk to her about it. Now does anyone else have any pressing questions to ask?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would like to know where you’ve been for the past three years, archbishop,” Hubert stated, “It would be good to corroborate the professor’s story.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Rhea slowly turned towards the blackclad man that had abruptly appeared out of nowhere, ignoring the startled yelps from the nearby knights. “...how did you–When did you get here??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Moments ago. Shez isn’t the only one who knows how to warp.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, I’m not?” Shez asked, before pausing, “Oh, wait, regular warp magic, right. Almost forgot that’s a thing…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like how you forgot to mention you have a fiance now?” Jeralt asked, raising an eyebrow at his daughter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...uh…I, well, we didn’t…it’s not exactly…she hasn’t asked me directly–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then allow me to do that right now!” Kronya declared with a dramatic swish of her golden cape, before she got down on one knee, “Shez Eisner, would you do me the honor of becoming my betrothed?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez blinked. She stared down at Kronya, who smiled brightly up at her, before she registered that the redheaded Agarthan actually had a ring in her hand. One made of black metal with an orange jewel embedded into it. “...o-oh. I…o-okay, yeah. Sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Kronya was kissing her on the lips and her bewildered response somehow felt just perfect.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Remarkably romantic,” Hubert drawled while Flayn let out a noise like a fully heated tea kettle. A sound that was echoed by a brightly smiling Mercedes and an even more excited Alois, who somehow managed a higher-pitch than either of the young women. At least one window broke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea, meanwhile, stiffened at the sight, before letting out an irritated huff. She crossed her arms over her chest, watching the display with open indignation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, the most visibly excited, by her standards, was Byleth, who was full on applauding alongside a deeply bewildered Edelgard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Whoa, what?” Shez exclaimed, breaking the kiss as she noticed her sister, “When the hell did you get here??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I had to burn three pulses to get the timing right,” Byleth explained, “I wasn’t going to miss this moment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...you said there was an emergency,” Edelgard remarked, frowning up at her professor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was absolutely an emergency. I would have brought Dorothea, but it took too long and I needed you so the guards wouldn’t ask questions. I’ll make it up to her later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez wasn’t sure what to make of anything right now. So she defaulted to pretending to be a lot more confident than she actually felt and leaning on her competitive side, wrapping an arm around Kronya’s waist, which earned a surprised yet pleased noise from the shorter Agarthan, and smirking at Byleth. “Well, I’m glad you got to see me beat you at romance! After all, I got proposed to first!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That snapped Jeralt out of his own stunned state, a sigh slipping out as his surprise at some woman he didn’t even recognize proposing to his daughter turned to a familiar exasperation. “Kid, seriously? Don’t make this a competition now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s fine Papa, I’ll allow Shez this victory,” Byleth said quite magnanimously, “After all, I am ahead of her in other ways.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused. “What? What’s that mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Simply that last night, I experienced a bliss that you have not, little sister.” Byleth allowed some smugness to show. “I am sure you’ll catch up soon enough. I still got there first though, thanks to Edelgard </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> Dorothea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stunned silence that followed was broken by Edelgard rolling her eyes. “Do you really have to talk about it like that? You’ll give people the wrong idea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? What do you mean? I was with you and Dorothea last night and it was very nice.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need to hear this,” Rhea decided, already feeling tired. Mentally, if not physically. “Shez, congratulations on your engagement. Emperor Edelgard, I believe you and I have matters to discuss that do not pertain to my granddaughter’s romantic dalliances.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Seteth stiffened, alarmed. “Wait, Lady Rhea, are you certain you should say that–“</span>

  <span>“Seteth, I flew here in dragon form. At this point I can hardly keep track of who knows what and which secrets are still secret, so I am hardly going to care if people know Byleth and I are family.” She paused. “Shez, you are also family, by extension, so please do invite me to the wedding. I like attending them and it’s been a while since I’ve gone to one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh, sure?” Shez agreed, “I mean, I guess everyone here is invited? You’re all either friends or family, so yeah.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, even me?” Catherine asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…” Shez had honestly forgotten the blonde knight was even here. “Uh…you can come along if Rhea or Shamir want to bring you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Well that’s better than I thought I’d get…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry Catherine, I’ll invite you to my wedding,” Byleth reassured, doing her best to smile at the knight when Edelgard immediately went pink beside her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ahem. Maybe we should save such a discussion for a different time?” Edelgard suggested after clearing her throat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, it should probably be after the proposal–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now then, I believe we should move somewhere else to discuss important matters, Rhea,” Edelgard said, trying to move past the topic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, let's,” Rhea agreed, taking the excuse to leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...So both of them at the same time, huh, professor?” Kronya commented, glancing over Byleth. “Impressive.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kronya, please don't.” Shez pleaded, not wanting to hear about her sister’s “romantic dalliances”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don't see what the big issue is, Shez,” Byleth said, tilting her head slightly, “Kronya and Lysithea are here so you can do it later.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What!?” Lysithea squeaked, feeling her face heat up while Shez raised an eyebrow at her sister. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jeez, By, I know it's been three years but I didn't think you'd end up becoming a perv.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? What's perverted about cuddling?” Byleth asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Shez sighed. “Never change, Byleth. Never change.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>The dungeons of Fort Merceus were rarely used to hold actual invaders. While the fortress city was one of the major capitals of the Empire, most of the people who lived in it were either members of the Imperial Army or those related to them, so the dungeon was usually reserved for those troops who needed to cool off after being drunk and disorderly. Certainly, the cells had held invaders, spies, and even deserters in the past, but it was rare for them to be this full.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They also weren’t usually so nicely furnished, but then Emperor Edelgard was well known for being surprisingly magnanimous with prisoners, particularly those who surrendered. Of course, her own past of being held in some particularly dark and foul dungeons did contribute to her aversion to poorly treating her own prisoners. And it was that same past that saw her frown at the sight of the sole surviving officer of the enemy garrison, sitting across from her on the other side of an interrogation table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The young woman, assuming she was as young as she looked, had black hair and the same shade of corpse-white skin most Agarthans had. The two lines tattooed under her right eye seemed to mark her as someone important, though the emperor didn’t have a complete understanding of just what Agarthan iconography actually meant. Perhaps she could learn now that she knew Shez had somehow seduced Kronya?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Those questions could come later though. “Captain Kore of Agartha. It is my understanding that you are the only remaining leader of the Hrym Army forces stationed at Fort Merceus. Is that correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman nodded. “It is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is also my understanding that you wish to speak on behalf of the soldiers under your command in order to ensure their fair and equitable treatment as prisoners of war. Is that also correct?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Another nod. “It is.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Very well then.” The emperor folded her hands and stared at the Agarthan captain, meeting the woman’s violet eyes with an even gaze. “My first question is ‘why?’ In my experience, your people do not tend to care for your subordinates.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was assigned to be the overseer of my battalion by my superiors,” Kore stated, her tone calm and professional, “The duties of a ‘captain’ is to utilize their subordinates to their fullest extent. This includes ensuring their health and well-being for the sake of cohesion and the effectiveness of the unit. I have found that the standard treatment engaged by other overseers, wherein ill-performing subordinates are tortured or executed, to be ineffective at maintaining unit efficacy. It is impractical.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see. That is a strange point of view for an Agarthan,” Edelgard noted, studying the stoic woman for any reactions, “In my experience, your people tend to prioritize sadism over practicality.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kore stared at her. “...Is there a question in your statement?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What made you decide to prioritize preserving the lives of your subordinates instead of taking a final stand and attempting to kill as many people as possible?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I believe I answered this question. My duty is to preserve the lives of my subordinates–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that really true?” Edelgard interrupted, “If you asked one of your sages, would they have told you to keep your soldiers alive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kore shook her head. “The priorities of the sages are irrelevant. Lord Dolofonos is dead, his orders have no bearing on my decisions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why is that? What made you want to keep your soldiers alive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...that…it is my duty to preserve–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t answer the question. Why is it a priority for you?” Edelgard looked her directly in the eyes and saw the Agarthan’s gaze waver. “I want to understand your reasoning, Kore. If I am satisfied by your explanation, it could ensure better treatment for yourself and your soldiers going forward.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That caught her attention. “I…I believe I understand. Though…” She mulled over the question, a small frown coming to her face. “...I was assigned to this fort soon after it was taken, approximately two years ago. It was believed that having some Agarthan superiors placed in a position of authority would ensure this strategic point would be kept secure from attempts to reclaim it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was placed in charge of a battalion of the Principality’s soldiers. It is my understanding that a majority of our forces are made up of those who benefited from Archduke Aegir’s policies and those who were disenfranchised by Imperial rule. I believe you would refer to them as ‘corrupt soldiers’ and ‘bandits’. I found their quality to be lacking and attempted an experiment in raising their effectiveness. The less educated members of the pack began referring to me as ‘Lady Boss’ as a result.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard raised an eyebrow. “The ‘pack’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...it is common parlance to refer to the individuals known as ‘Fodlans’ as ‘beasts’. I have found most of the Fodlans do not like being referred to as such and have endeavored to change my language appropriately. However, some members of my battalion seemed to take pride in the designation and began referring to themselves as ‘hounds’ for reasons I do not understand. They seemed to appreciate my efforts to ensure their effectiveness, however. My refusal to use torture as a punishment was viewed as benevolent, rather than practical. Bleeding soldiers do not make for effective soldiers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. And no other Agarthans took issue with your mindset?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A majority did not care. One did react negatively to my efforts to ensure efficiency and murdered one of my subordinates on a whim. Murder is not tolerated in an effective encampment, and I executed him for the crime. My fellow captains understood from that point on that the members of my battalion were part of an experiment I was running, and any attempt to disrupt the experiment would result in their immediate, lethal removal as a factor. My superiors did not care either way as long as manpower was not wasted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see. Well, while I cannot confirm the status of all your men, those we have captured had their wounds treated. I presume you'll wish to negotiate for yours and their treatment going forward?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...If possible, I wish to speak with my battalion. Some of them may act in ways that risk the others, so I wish to let them know I have things handled.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard nodded. “You will be permitted to speak with them, though you will be kept under watch while you do so. I hope I don’t need to directly state that any attempts to escape would not go well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I understand. I will endeavor to ensure my soldiers will not give you cause to rescind the mercy you have shown them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard gave her another nod, then stood and walked out of the room without another word. Then she simply waited outside the door, listening to hear if Kore let anything slip now that she was supposedly alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And sure enough, the Agarthan let out a relieved sigh as she slumped in her seat. “Scary…no one said the hegemon was that scary…stupid Dolofonos, stupid Myson, why do I have to be in charge now? I wanna go home…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…” Edelgard made a mental note to make sure Bernadetta “unintentionally” encountered Kore. Judging by Kronya, the easiest way to get an Agarthan to fully defect was to introduce them to someone similar to them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She would probably have to keep Hubert away from her though. He’d either scare her off or, considering how Bernadetta acted around him, somehow earn the Agarthan’s attraction, and she did not need more relationship drama in her camp.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“It truly is strange,” Lysithea muttered as she poked at the slice of strawberry cake set on the table in front of her. Not something one would normally have at a war camp, but there was a celebration going on. “Anyone, myself included, would think I would be much angrier about having the girl I have affections for abruptly stolen out from under me. Yet at most I feel…maybe annoyed, but more so at Kronya in general for making a spectacle than at her for romancing Shez.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…do you think you care for her as well?” Marianne asked, the former Deer taking a moment to refill both of their teacups, “Sort of how Professor Byleth cares for both Lady Edelgard and Dorothea?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…I feel like if I start liking Kronya, I’ll have to have my head checked. Falling in love with an idiot is one thing, but falling for two of them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is she really that bad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s Emily, Marianne.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marianne paused, thinking back to what she knew of the odd noble from back at the academy. Which, to be fair, wasn’t much since they essentially swapped classes, so she just made a non-commital noise and shrugged. “Maybe you’re happy for them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…I do not think that is it either. I…I think I am jealous? I cannot say I like the idea of Shez spending her life away from me…No, in fact, I think I hate that idea! I want to be with her, to spend time together, whatever time we do have, and the idea that Kronya of all people is stealing that from me is infuriating!” she snapped, before sitting back down with a huff. “…alright, maybe I am angrier about this than I thought.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marianne nodded, choosing not to mention the cracks in the table where Lysithea had put her hands. “I think I understand. Things have been happening very quickly lately, so it’s difficult to process your feelings until you have a moment to sit with them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mmf.” Lysithea slumped on the table, glaring at her slice of cake. “…it likely is something like that. I know I am irritated. I think a part of me believed we would remain in our current equilibrium for longer, where neither myself nor Kronya actually made the push towards marriage. I should have known that impulsive fool would throw caution to the wind and I’m just as annoyed at myself for not realizing it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marianne took a sip of her tea as she collected her thoughts. She didn’t really feel qualified to give relationship advice, especially with her own lack of one… “What do you want to do going forward?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph…well, I can either give up on Shez or try to force my way into their relationship…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marianne furrowed her brow. “Are you sure those are the only options?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to be a jealous fool pining after someone I cannot have. If this were a contest, then Kronya has won already with a decisive strike.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But…it isn’t a contest,” Marianne pointed out, “And…well, the professor seems happy to be with Dorothea and Edelgard. Very happy, actually. So…are you sure there isn’t a way you can be happy here too?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea paused. She turned her gaze towards Marianne, a bit surprised. “I have to say, I didn’t expect that from you, Marianne.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The noblewoman blushed slightly, before smiling. “Being in the Empire has been good for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…yes, it has. Alright, I know what I’m doing!” Lysithea pushed herself up from the table and strode her way right over to where Kronya and Shez were sitting together, currently being regaled by Alois with the tale of his own proposal to his wife.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you should have seen it, we danced and danced all night!” Alois said, practically shouting as he leaned against Shez, the purple-haired girl looking both amused and exhausted at his antics. Kronya, on the other hand, looked like she was ready to stab someone if it wasn't for Shez holding onto her. “It's the most memorable night of my life, even more so than when I became a knight!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alois, sorry to interrupt, but the professor was asking for you,” Lysithea cut in, getting his attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, what does she need?” Alois asked, glancing at the white-haired girl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…” Lysithea glanced over at Byleth, the green-haired merc currently chowing down on her meal, in between chatting with Mercedes and Flayn. “She wants to ask you for advice on how to propose.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was like she spoke the magic words. “Oh! Well of course, I would be happy to share a proposal for proposing! No, wait, let me do that again, I’m sure I can think of a better–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should hurry, I think she might go to Seteth if you’re not available.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh goddess, no! I can’t let him take my spot as honorary uncle!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez watched her self-appointed honorary uncle sprint away, before glancing at Lysithea skeptically. “Byleth didn’t really ask for him, did she?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I just needed him to leave so I could speak to you. To both of you,” she stated, looking at Kronya, who raised an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well if you wanted him gone, I could think of a much easier way to do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kronya, you’re not stabbing Alois,” Shez reprimanded, earning a smirk from her fiance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I never said–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know what you were implying. Anyways, Lysithea, what did you want to talk about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysithea put her hands on the table, deciding to be blunt. “What place do I have in your life going forward?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez paused. “Uh…okay, wow, that’s a heavy question.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know, but it is one I need to have answered,” Lysithea said, before sighing, “You already accepted Kronya’s proposal, and it seems like you genuinely do wish to be with her. However, I am attracted to you as well and…well, I have reasons to find you infuriating, Kronya, but I do consider you a friend instead of an enemy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kronya blinked at her. “Oh. I…have to admit, that feels good to hear, pip–Uh, Lysithea. I think of you as a friend too.” Her tails fidgeted, plainly showing her discomfort with being emotionally open. “Uh, Shez, you talk now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh, sure, right.” Shez took a breath, collecting her thoughts. “Right…okay. I guess…I never really thought about…no, I did think about romance stuff, sure. I’ve thought about it a lot, actually. And…I do like both of you. I like you, Lysithea. But I also like Kronya. And…I think I love both of you. You’re my best friends and it makes me happy when you’re around. Whatever happens with all this war stuff going forward, I want to make sure both of you are happy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...That's good to hear,” Lysithea said, feeling her face turn pink, “We don't need to talk about all the details here and now, but going forward…you and me, and you and Kronya, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don't mind. Besides, I'm the one who's going to be in charge so it doesn't matter,” Kronya stated, smirking at Lysithea's confused expression. “What? Don't forget that I'm gonna be in charge of a noble house who is in charge of the Alliance.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“House Riegan isn't in charge of the Alliance just because they're the Duke!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm, you're right. Shez help me figure out how to become the Queen of the Alliance.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…would it still be called The Alliance if there was a queen?” Shez helpfully asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That's true…well we can't make it a kingdom, that'll make it seem like we're ripping off Faerghus,” Kronya said, frowning in thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, you're impossible. Come on Shez, you've spent enough time around her today,” Lysithea said, grabbing onto Shez to drag her away. Or at least, she would have, if it weren't for the fact that she wasn't physically strong and Kronya grabbed onto Shez in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And who said you could take her?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I deserve to spend some alone time with her!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey I wasn't spending any time alone with her either with Alois spouting off about his wife!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What!? it's not like it's my fault you couldn't figure out how to drive him away like I did!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut it pipsqueak!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm taller than you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez couldn't help but sigh as she was pulled from both sides by the two girls, both of whom seemed much more invested in arguing than actually coming to a decision. Ah well, this is what she signed up for, so she really had no right to complain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Besides, it felt kind of nice being fought over.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Rhea felt a vein pulse in her head as she listened to Seteth and Hubert continue their “argument”. It was difficult to see it as one, given the pair had devolved from actually arguing about logistics to poorly sniping at one another like the pettiest of children. She was sure if it went on long enough they would both devolve into crying tantrums. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though before she could interrupt she felt a hand on her shoulder. Glancing over, she saw Jeralt staring at her, before gesturing to a door for the two to head out through. Deciding a tactical retreat was better than dealing with the two bickering children, Rhea left with him, and soon the two of them stood on the ramparts of the fort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for that rescue, General Jeralt,” Rhea began, respectfully using her old friend’s new title, “It seems you still have the heart of a knight, no matter how much time passes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No need for the thanks. I could tell things would escalate if you got involved,” was the man's gruff response. It wasn't much, but at least he didn't sneak out on his own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I had forgotten how irritating war meetings could be. Though even though it has been so long since I've been in a war council, the squabbling remains the same.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And when would that have been? Back when you were Seiros, or someone else?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...When I was Seiros. I was never one for tactics, but as I was the ‘Chosen of the Goddess’ it was expected of me to join in each meeting. If it weren't for Wilhelm, I likely would have knocked out many officers during those meetings.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...for three hundred years, we knew each other. I thought I knew so much about you, but you never told me about this, huh?” He huffed. “But I guess I shouldn’t be surprised you’d keep secrets from me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea grimaced. “I suppose there could be countless excuses I could come up with. Yet nothing I say would be able to make up for what I did to your child.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It wouldn't, no. The only reason I'm willing to talk to you at all is because Byleth seems to have made up with you at some point in the last few years.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That is one way to put it. We certainly had plenty of time to talk and fight.” She sighed. “I could provide excuses, but we both know they would be empty. I made a number of stupid, selfish decisions and deeply hurt those I care for. I can only offer my sincere apologies, and hope that I haven’t destroyed our friendship completely.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Jeralt turned his gaze fully towards her. “I want you to be completely honest. What happened with Sitri?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Sitri was never the healthiest, you know this. The fault there can be laid upon me. Mother could create life upon a whim, but my powers were a pale imitation of hers. Try as I might, none of my daughters could be called a full-blooded Nabatean, and they didn't have the hardiness of a normal human constitution. So when it came time for Byleth’s birth, though I tried everything I could, I knew I wouldn't be able to save them both. So Sitri asked me to do the only thing that would have ensured Byleth’s safety. To give Byleth her heart, the crest stone that was her source of life.” Rhea closed her eyes, vividly remembering that exact moment. The tears in Sitri’s eyes, yet also a fiery determination that the archbishop had never seen before. “More than anything, Sitri wanted Byleth to live. And…I wish I could say that was my only thought as well. I wish I was as good as she thought I was. I…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...did you kill her, Rhea? Did you kill Sitri?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did. I could give my reasons, both justifiable and monstrous, but it was my hand that removed her heart and placed it within your daughter’s chest. I am a mother who murdered her child.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Jeralt took a slow breath, his hands clenching at his sides. His knuckles popped from the tension. “...she really asked you to?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She did. I don’t know if that should change anything though. My motives were suspect, regardless of her choices in the matter, and I understand if you bear hatred towards me for them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hatred would be putting it lightly. It'd be one thing if it was just that, but you were going to use Byleth too, weren't you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can't deny that, no. I convinced myself that she had truly died that day and the one who was reborn was the goddess in disguise. Which is what led to my change in demeanor, as you are aware.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I always wondered for the longest time whether I had made the right choice to leave with Byleth,” Jeralt admitted, “I did the best I could, but it wasn't a life she should have lived. Even so, it was better than whatever you had planned for her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was, that can't be denied. Whatever safety she might have been guaranteed would simply be a cage that would have tightened around her, particularly if I had any reason to believe the goddess truly did dwell inside her.” She sighed again, staring out into the distant fields. If she knew the land correctly, Garreg Mach laid in the direction they were looking, though far beyond the horizon. “Perhaps I could have loved Byleth for herself, but unless mother spoke to me directly to just tell me I was a forlorn fool refusing to let go of the past, as she did within that void, I would have ruined whatever relationship we had one way or another. It’s in my nature to do so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, now you’re just being unfair to yourself,” Jeralt grumbled, before fixing Rhea with a direct stare, “Look, I don’t like what happened. I don’t think I’ll ever feel fine with knowing how Sitri died or what you had planned for Byleth. But you stayed with my kid for three years and made sure to take care of her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, to be clear, I did attempt to harm her in a rage initially before my mother intervened,” Rhea interrupted. She winced at the flat stare Jeralt gave her. “I thought I should be honest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…Rhea, there are a lot of reasons I shouldn’t punch you. The reasons I should are feeling a lot more compelling right now, and you keep adding to them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Er, my apologies. Though, perhaps you should? If it would help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rhea. You’re still the Archbishop. And there are a good hundred people around here that would try to gut me if they saw me punch you in the face. So let’s avoid that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…I’m not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt raised an eyebrow. “You’re not what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am no longer the Archbishop. At least…I plan to dissolve the position as soon as I can. My leadership has been lacking for far too long, and it is high time the church steps back from trying to rule, particularly through manipulation and falsehoods. I understand that Emperor Edelgard has plans for the future that Byleth wishes to aid, so I wish to learn more about what she plans.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well for starters, she's not a fan of you,” Jeralt stated getting Rhea to frown, “In fact, I’m pretty sure she was planning on starting a war with you if the Kingdom hadn't kicked things off first.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea stared at her old comrade who had just calmly informed her that Edelgard wanted to wage war against her as though it was just small talk. Though, given what Rhea knew about her already… “Is this related to her being the Flame Emperor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you know about that part?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think the more significant thing is that you know about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt shrugged. “She told me not long after we got away from the monastery. I was upset, sure, but Byleth likes her, so I gave the emperor a chance and I can’t say I regret it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Even though you know she wanted my head?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure if it’s past tense.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea sighed, frowning at her friend’s morbid joke. “Hm. Well, I suppose that means the Alliance is the only nation that doesn’t have a leader that wants me dead. Perhaps I should try retiring there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know about that. There might be some arrogant noble that thinks they’re smarter than they are aiming at you for their own reasons.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Somewhere in Almyra, Claude abruptly sneezed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhea, meanwhile, grimaced. “It’s Gloucester, isn’t it? I never liked that family…the young man at the academy prayed often, but I could tell it was just for show.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rhea, I'm pretty sure most nobles are just religious for show.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hmph. You’re just cynical, Jeralt. I’m certain a majority of the nobility at the academy were perfectly faithful young people. Besides, I encountered the young lord Gloucester recently, so I am confident in my assessment of his character. He is clearly the deceptive schemer of the group, much like the Vestra boy is for Edelgard’s Eagles.” She paused. “Come to think of it, it might be his fault she was led so far astray…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rhea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t say ‘what’. You know what I’m talking about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jeralt, I don’t know–“ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re trying to find reasons that it isn’t Edelgard’s fault that she doesn’t like you because you want to like her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…that isn’t something I do,” Rhea grumbled, averting her gaze from her old friend. Because she was annoyed with him, obviously, and not because he has any sort of point. “…maybe if she made friends with a nice, pious girl, she could rediscover her love for the goddess. Someone like Mercedes, perhaps?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt sighed beside her and even muttered “Seriously, Rhea?” but she didn’t know why he was acting so exasperated. Clearly this was the perfect plan. What could possibly go wrong?</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Jeritza von Hrym was a man with darkness in his heart. He knew that truth quite intimately, for it haunted his every waking moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No matter where he was, no matter what he was doing, the Death Knight was within him, and the years of brutal bloodshed he had committed against the northern invaders made that monster’s voice so much louder. It did not speak to him, not with words, but with impulses and dangerous thoughts. More than once, his ruined mind would consider striking against his own allies, of slicing the War Minister’s head from his shoulders in the middle of a meeting or riding down his own men in the midst of a charge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bergliez had noticed. Understandable, given how blatant his monstrous urges must be. Yet, for some reason, that led to the War Minister making Jeritza his adjutant? A baffling decision by all measures, especially since Jeritza deliberately wore the Death Knight’s armor to make people interact with him less. And yet, for another bizarre reason, Bergliez appeared to find his murderous curse amusing instead of concerning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It almost came as a relief when he received a letter from Lord Hubert recalling him from the western front. Apparently, Byleth Eisner had returned from wherever she went and Hubert believed her return represented an opportunity to change the direction of the war. So while Bergliez assured Jeritza he would be missed, for some reason, he would have to leave the war against Faerghus to return to his master’s side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One of his subordinates gave him a basket of muffins for the journey. It was an odd gesture, particularly since Jeritza and the Death Horse would be warping most of the way, but they were nice to snack on so he supposed it was acceptable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once he made it to the emperor’s war camp, however, he was surprised to learn her majesty had apparently seized Fort Merceus already and had been residing there for nearly a week, repairing and reinforcing the fortress while also conducting diplomatic talks with the Church of Seiros. Jeritza had been under the impression that the Church was defunct, given most of it had burned down, so he was somewhat surprised to hear there were even talks necessary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In fact, hadn’t Edelgard put the small green girl in charge of the church? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…questions for later. For now, he intended to see just what happened at the fort in his absence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“–and the false god spoke his most hateful truth, that the very relics wielded by the unrighteous nobility born of the Elites were made from the bones and hearts of our goddess’s very own children!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t expecting a sermon. A sermon might get the very last thing he would have ever expected to hear in the Emperor’s camp, given her antipathy towards the church. Yet there was a woman, clad in radiant white armor, speaking to a large crowd of soldiers in both church white and Imperial crimson.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yet we are not lost, my friends! For despite the betrayals conducted in her name, the goddess forgives!” the woman declared, her strangely familiar voice reverberating in a hooded helm crafted to resemble a serene woman’s face, “She fought for us against the false god and his face-stealing servants, and even freed Her sister from his fell clutches! Not even dragging Her into his own domain could stop our goddess from striking him down! And though it took many years of fighting, She has returned to us once more! The Goddess walks among us! And with Her righteous fury, we shall deliver justice upon those who have escaped it for far too long!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were cheers from the crowd, though Jeritza wasn’t quite sure what he was feeling. Something about the woman’s voice…it made him feel strangely warm. Almost…nostalgic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then the woman caught sight of him, and he could hear her gasp. He was used to that reaction though, so it didn’t bother–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, my apologies, friends, but the goddess has sent me a wonderful sign! Lady Flayn, would you mind taking over?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oh, so the small green girl was here. The armored woman passed over the book she had held while speaking and hurried from the stage. Jeritza briefly wondered where she was going, before he noticed she was headed right for him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Death Horse whinnied at his side as Jeritza felt himself tense, his hand twitching for–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“EMILE!” Then he heard that name and went completely still, right before the woman, his sister, crashed right into his chest and wrapped her arms tightly around him. Jeritza couldn't help but stiffen, about to push her away as he felt the Death Knight begin to rise– “Oh Emile! It’s so good to finally see you! Where were you?! Do you know how worried I've been?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Mercedes?” The moment he fully realized who was holding onto him, he grabbed onto her shoulders, pushing her away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Reaching up, Mercedes took off her helmet, the young woman breathing heavily as she wiped her brow. “Hah, my apologies, I acted hastily there. I suppose it must be quite a sight to see me dressed like this.” She laughed a little awkwardly, then shook her head. “Mm, my apologies, again. I’m not used to wearing such heavy armor, but Lady Rhea and Cardinal Luca thought it would suit me. Well, the Cardinal did. Lady Rhea’s sense of fashion…ah, never mind that! How are you? Are you well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeritza could be forgiven for not responding immediately. The first thing he could even think to say was– “You cut your hair.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm? Oh, yes, I did.” Mercedes giggled, adjusting the short bob her hair had become. “It felt more practical to change it. But more importantly, how are you Emile?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hearing his name again, Jertiza couldn't help but jerk back. “My name is Jeritza, knight in service to Emperor Edelgard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Emile, I know we haven't truly spoken since we were children, but surely you remember me. We met again at the academy, remember? Oh, how have you been doing? Have you been eating well? You haven’t just been eating sweets, have you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeritza thought back to the basket of muffins he had eaten on the way, then quickly buried down whatever feelings his sister’s concern had stirred within him. “This ‘Emile’ you speak of is long gone. There is no reason to speak to me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I see, I understand,” Mercedes said, nodding her head, which made Jeritza let out a sigh of relief that his sister understood– “You must be attempting to birth yourself anew under the grace of the goddess to cleanse yourself of your past sins! Worry not my dear brother, for I shall aid you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeritza blinked, before suddenly he suddenly found himself being tugged away from his horse by  his very insistent and surprisingly strong sister. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Here, I should introduce you to everyone–Oh, though, no, you would know everyone already, wouldn’t you? You have been working with Edelgard for the past few years, and I know you were at the church three years ago,” his sister mused while continuing to pull him along, mostly because he had almost immediately fallen back into instinctively following her lead. Vague childhood memories resurfaced as she led him through the camp. She had been taller than him, once, and it felt strange looking down at her– “Oh, I know! I should bring you to Constance! Oh it’s been so long since she’s seen you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh no.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked around, in hopes of finding a form of salvation. It would be simple enough to pull himself free, but he didn't wish to hurt his sister, even as the Death Knight began to rise at the thought. Maybe he could say he had orders that he needed to attend to first? He had been told to arrive here so really he needed to speak with the Emperor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I need to–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There you are, Constance!” Mercedes called out, getting the blonde who was currently resting in the shade with Hapi to look over at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, did you require my aid, Mercedes?” Constance asked, smiling as she got up, while Hapi lazily waved at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I just came over to introduce you to Emile! I know you two have been serving under Emperor Edelgard, but I wanted to make sure you two did know each other.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Emile? Oh how wonderful it is to–...Wait, the Death Knight is Emile!? Is this why you've been avoiding me whenever you were at the palace!?” Constance asked, completely flabbergasted as Jeritza stood there awkwardly, unsure of how to escape. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So as the only one out of the loop, what's going on?” Hapi asked, feeling curious about the situation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, Hapi, as I've told you before, this is my childhood friend, Mercedes. And Jeritza here is apparently her little brother Emile,” Constance explained, gesturing at them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Little?” Hapi muttered, staring up at Jeritza. “Jerry seems pretty big to me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He was much smaller when he was young. I have no idea how he managed to shoot up so significantly.” Constance huffed, before thinking about something, “Perhaps I could make a spell to make people shorter or taller…something to consider.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Enough of this. I have to report to the Emperor,” Jeritza stated, finally pulling himself free of Mercedes’ grasp. “I am not this Emile you speak of, I am the Death Knight, and I–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Emile.” Only to stop at Mercedes’s voice, her tone brooking no argument, “I understand that you've been through much, and I won't force you to do anything, but you're my brother. That fact will always be true. No matter what trials you go through, I'll be there to help you, even if you don't want my help. And once you're done, then we can go visit Mother together, okay?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeritza glanced back at her for a moment, “...I shall remember your words.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he walked, very calmly, to meet with his emperor. No, he was not running away. That would be comical.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dang. Your big little brother can move fast, Merce,” Hapi commented, watching the fully armored knight practically power walking away from their group.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He always was a good runner,” Mercedes said with open pride, smiling happily. Truly, the Goddess had blessed her on this day to be able to see Emile again. She really should make sure to spread Her word to him soon. Maybe he could join her in her sermons?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For some reason, Jeritza felt an urge to start running. The worrying part was that, as far as he could tell, the urge was coming from the Death Knight…</span>

  <p>
  <span>Lord Myson of Shambhala, Sage of Thunder and duly appointed protector of the Agarthan people, had a lot on his mind at the moment. For the first time in a while, the creator of monstrosities fouler than any other felt…perturbed. Though that might not be the right word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t exactly troubled, per se, nor truly unsettled, but perhaps…annoyed? There certainly was some annoyance in the mix of feelings percolating in his skull as he stared down at the map in his castle’s war room. Well, Ludwig’s castle, though anyone reasonable could tell who was holding the leash between the man and the beast he declared “Archduke”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regardless, Myson wasn’t happy. Yes, that was the right way to explain it; for all the emotions roiling within him, not one of them was positive. And why would they be? The stack of reports strewn across the floor had nothing but bad news within them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Failure after failure stained the ink on those pages, all pointing to one truth that he found increasingly difficult to ignore–</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“MYSON!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The doors slammed open and the thunder sage raised his gaze towards the fat, bald beast that decided to invade his domain. “Ludwig. I was just thinking about you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t give me that!” the archduke snapped, “I can’t afford to be afraid of you right now, not when I had to hear from some random soldier on patrol that we lost Fort Merceus!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson grimaced. “Which soldier was that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t change the subject! That idiot wasn’t the only person I spoke with! I know we’ve completely lost Merceus, just the same as I know Dolofonos is dead and Mozghuz is still standing! What in the world happened out there!? I thought you were supposed to have a dozen secret projects in place to stop Edelgard from making any progress!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do have more projects, Ludwig. I simply need time to implement them.” It rankled to have to explain himself to a beast. The wretch in front of him was far more palatable when it was cowering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yet Aegir didn’t seem to understand that fact. “We don’t have time! Holding Merceus was the only thing that kept Edelgard from pushing her way into our territories! How long do we have before she takes Varley or Boramas!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We have forces in her way, Ludwig–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And she just joined together with the Church’s army! I thought they were supposed to be eradicated?! You told me–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They </span>
  <em>
    <span>were</span>
  </em>
  <span> eradicated,” Myson retorted, his irritation growing, “The fact is, the church’s forces were scattered after the battle at Garreg Mach. We destroyed the largest force. That there are still some feeble remnants clinging to life is not–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Feeble remnants?! Myson, they have a damned dragon sent by the goddess! Or did you not receive that report?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson did receive that report. He received a great many reports, but it was Shax’s report of what, precisely, happened at Mozghuz that contributed to his current mix of negative emotions. A simple attempt to cow the damned imperials and that rebellious brat they called an emperor had turned into a complete loss. An entire battalion of oratores and bellatores had been wiped out, and his moronic weapon of mass destruction had gotten herself killed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pointed Bias towards a softer target specifically so she wouldn’t let her damn grudge override her sense, and yet, somehow, she went right into battle against the Fell Star anyway! And then she had the temerity to lose!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It had been a poor decision in hindsight, a thought to simply cull the beasts and remind them of their places, yet now he was down two sages, lost a major fortress, and the abominations were apparently allying with the imperials. He didn’t want a repeat of the Second Great War, damn it!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Myson! MYSON!” And then there was the beast chattering at him!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is it, Ludwig?” Myson asked, affecting an appearance of calm even as he buried down his urge to rip the beast’s tongue from its mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are we going to do?! We can’t sit here and wait for Edelgard to make her next move! Not when we’re already on the backfoot!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am aware of that. However, plans will need to be adjusted. We are on the defensive now, so if we act too hastily–” A knock at the door made Myson grit his teeth. “Enter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A masked Agarthan dressed in the standard robes of his station entered and bowed. “Lord Myson, I bring ill-tidings from the northern front. Our attempt to destroy the Bridge of Myrddin has failed at the hands of the enemy called ‘Gloucester’. While some damage was done, the structure remains intact, and we have received a direct declaration of war from the Leicester Alliance as a result.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...we weren’t already at war with them?” Myson had to ask.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gloucester seems to believe it needs to be made official through paperwork, Lord Myson.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Myson made a mental note to hunt down the current lord of Gloucester once this debacle was over with. “I see. Change of plans, Ludwig. You’re going to Boramas.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Aegir blinked. “What? Hold on, what are you–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You wanted this, didn’t you? Go to Boramas, defend your city. I’ll send Shax with you along with a sufficient number of regiments and demonic beasts to act as a supporting force for your task. If needed, I will fully support you in a longstanding siege against the empire.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...hm. Well, it’s good you see reason,” Aegir said, nodding to him, “I’ll get ready to go at once.” He paused for a moment, his face twisting as though what he was about to say pained him. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s no need.” Especially since Myson’s true reason for sending the bald beast to Boramas was so he’d delay whatever forces the Empire and the Church brought to bear. “Do be quick. As you said, time is of the essence.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Aegir nodded and hurried away, proving yet again how obedient of a tool he was. If only the rest of his subordinates were as groveling…maybe it was something he could work on? Shax might have had a substandard performance lately, but his creation was devoted to the point of retrieving Bias’s corpse even while under threat from the Fell Star.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Perhaps there was something he could use there? He had been meaning to go back to Shambhala for some time now, so with a flick of his wrist, the sage warped away. He could have someone else deal with cleaning up the reports.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The void beyond death was redder than Bias thought it would be. She knew, once upon a time, that her people believed in a vast afterlife of plains and rivers, ruled over by a god that wept tears of iron for the lost.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then the Agarthans discovered Zahras, and the truth of the nothingness that lay beyond became clear to them all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So imagine her disappointment when instead of blissful cessation, she felt only a pulsing, painful heat. She wanted to move, to do something, but she felt stuck, trapped, as though restrained by straps and buckles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A surge of hate went through her body. If this was what death was, if she had to be trapped in her own aching body and </span>
  <em>
    <span>aware</span>
  </em>
  <span> of herself, then couldn’t she at least see her sister? Wasn’t that allowed?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a brief moment, she was genuinely tempted to pray to the Fell Star for some release from this hell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then she opened her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She still felt that heat, that pain, the ache in her body, but it dulled to the familiar levels she normally felt. The biggest difference was the strangely heavy sensation at her head, but she ignored that in favor of assessing her situation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you’re awake. Good timing. Lord Myson is visiting for an inspection.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias blinked, slowly, then turned her gaze towards the mage standing at her side. “…Odesse?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, Lady Bias,” the robed man agreed, bobbing his head in a nod that made him resemble the bird he was masked as.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t you dead?” If so, she was going to be very annoyed with whoever was running this shitty afterlife.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, Lady Bias. I think I would know if I was. Or would I?” He tilted his head, considering the question, then shrugged. “Regardless, I believe you are referring to my predecessor, Odesse the First, as I have chosen to designate him. Lord Myson decided I should be the new Odesse after his demise at the hands of Epimenides.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. I knew that, I was there.” She let out a sigh, laying back on the surgery table she was strapped to. The lights overhead, gleaming blue lines in black steel, showed she was back in Shambhala. “So I’m alive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Odesse didn’t seem to mind the disappointment in her voice. “Indeed, you are. Your core was salvageable and I am familiar enough with your model at this point to make repairs to your redundant gray matter without requiring a full transfer to new flesh. I could still perform the transfer at your request, however.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Remove my restraints, then we can talk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Lady Bias.” With a simple press of a button, the restraints slid open, allowing Bias to sit up and take stock of her damaged body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Admittedly, there was less damage than she expected, considering the last thing she saw was Byleth Eisner’s relic sword swinging for her head. She didn’t even have much damage beneath the neck, aside from the scars that were already present from her past injuries.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…is there anything I should know?” she asked, glancing at her healer, “I had one of Myson’s enhancement stones explode on my forehead. I figure that should have done some damage.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, an enormous amount, yes. I did have to replace a great deal of your skull plating, graft some skin, and add in stitches and bolting to keep everything together, but it was still much better than I would have expected. Under most circumstances, the physical impact of the explosion would have caused your brain to smash against the interior of your skull, presuming the skull itself did not shatter from the concussive force. Fortunately for you, you were built to be a superior being!” Odesse stated with plenty of Agarthan pride.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...sure. Are you saying I lived because I’m built better?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I presume so! Your physical body is surprisingly hardy for a member of the oratores caste. While physique is important, of course, most of our caste is built to emphasize mental processing power over physical strength and durability.” He tilted his head, thinking. “I suppose if I had to make an alternative hypothesis, it is possible that your attunement to the enhancement stone granted you a measure of protection against its effects. Most mages are shielded from the effects of their own magic, otherwise every fireball would burn the skin from the hand of their casters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. And what if the enhancement stone changed me physically?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I suppose that is an alternative hypothesis, Lady Bias,” Odesse replied, though he didn’t sound too happy with the idea. Either because he truly believed in Agarthan supremacy, or because he just didn't like being told he was wrong.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Either way, Bias had more important things to focus on. “What about shrapnel? The stone exploded, so the pieces of it had to go somewhere.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, there was shrapnel. I had to dig out most of it while performing your surgery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“‘Most’?” Bias grimaced. “Odesse, do I have rocks in my head?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is unlikely, though not impossible, that I missed some small fragments. I meant more that there were shards in your clothing, Lady Bias. Luckily the explosion was localized to your forehead, so I mainly had to remove the fragments from the front half of your upper body. You should be entirely clean of them though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...If you’re wrong about that, I’m going to smack you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If I am incorrect, Lady Bias, then my life is forfeit for the sake of restoring–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it isn’t,” she interrupted, “I outlined what the punishment is if you’re wrong. I’m not going to kill you for saving my life. If you screwed up, I will smack you, once, in a location of my choosing. Probably your face, but it might be the shoulder if I’m not feeling particularly vindictive.” She paused, a frown coming to her face. “Hey, ah…were there any other survivors with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Lady Bias. Project Deva, who has chosen the designation ‘Shax’, is responsible for returning you to us. His own restoration was simple.” For some reason, Bias had the impression Odesse was smiling under his mask. “Your mending was invaluable in ensuring his continued survival, Lady Bias. It was very impressive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...sure.” Bias decided to ignore whatever weird feelings his praise gave her, instead looking around the surgery suite. “So is he here, or…?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He is, yes.” Odesse turned and tapped at the walls, sending out a signal through the facility. “I have just alerted him to your awakening–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Immediately, there was a flash of violet and Shax appeared. “LADY BIAS! YOU’RE OKAY!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias winced at the noise, her head throbbing. “Tone it down, your voice is stabbing into my brain.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Oh, sorry! I’ll keep quiet, I promise!” the weird little mutant swore, still smiling brightly at her, before he paused for some reason. “Oh, huh. Lady Bias, you don’t have clothes on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...yeah? And? I just had surgery, why would I have clothes on?” she asked, staring at his confused expression.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhhh…I guess that’s a good question? Why would you…What? Wait, what does ‘take a chance’ mean?” Shax tilted his head, then shook off whatever strange thoughts he was having. “Ah, whatever. I’m glad to see you’re okay! I knew you’d be! You’re a sage, you’re too amazing to die to any beast!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias refrained from pointing out how many of their sages had already died to the ‘beasts’. Still, she couldn’t let him live with any delusions. “You were the one that kept me alive, Shax.” Even if she wasn’t sure how to feel about that fact. “The only reason I’m here is because of you, not any inherent quality on my part.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well that’s not necessarily–” Odesse began before silencing himself when Bias glared at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...thank you for saying that,” Shax said, a genuine smile on his face. It was a nice sight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...alright, enough emotions for now. Odesse, give me a robe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, Lady Bias.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias rolled her eyes at the deference, then winced slightly at the headache the motion gave her, but still got dressed in a simple robe once it was offered to her. Nothing fancy yet, but she could always get dressed properly soon enough. For now, she had questions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, you’re running things here?” Bias asked, glancing at Odesse again as she tied the robe closed at her waist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed, Lady Bias! I was assigned as the steward of Shambhala by Lord Myson while he focused his attention on the war effort!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? And how’s that going?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Quite well! The majority of the more acerbic members of our leadership are busy on the battlefield, so I have been able to get a great deal of work done on our projects without any questioning or sabotage from those who wish to vie for the power of my position.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias briefly wondered if she counted as one of those ‘acerbic members’ sent to the battlefield before a frown came to her face. “What projects are those?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I thought you knew already. Well, given Lord Myson is focused on the production of ‘demonic beasts’ at his outpost and Lady Cleobulus has requisitioned a majority of our weapon production capabilities, I have focused my efforts primarily on Project Pittacus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…oh. Uh…that’s…good,” Bias murmured. A part of her never quite believed that Myson was actually working on bringing her sister back. Hearing differently…it was definitely something. “Can I see your results?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course! Right this way!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias followed behind Odesse as he led the way through the facility, her mind still racing with the potential implications of her sister’s potential resurrection. She noticed Shax following behind them, and almost cracked a smile at how dutiful the boy was being. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Still trying to be my bodyguard, huh?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She brushed off the stray thought as they arrived at a room filled with incubation vats. The large, glass tubes seemed to be modified though, the fluid inside more of a greenish shade than the typical watery liquid that would normally fill the birthplaces of the modern Agarthans. Part of her mind turned towards considering the chemical composition and what effects this new liquid might have, but most of her thoughts were focused on the figures within the vats.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Each one contained a single Agarthan, and every one of those Agarthans was identical to Bias.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Woah…so many Lady Biases…” Bias could hear Shax’s amazed curiosity from behind her, his fascination obvious, but her attention was fully on her replicas. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...What is this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Project Pittacus!” Odesse proudly declared, “More specifically, subjects thirty-seven to fifty-eight. Subjects one to thirty-six were deemed complete failures and disposed of.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her hand twitched. “What do you mean ‘disposed’ of?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well simply put it's surprisingly difficult to recreate someone with limited materials that were in far from pristine conditions, especially since I myself did not know Lady Pittacus very well, so I've been going off of Lord Myson’s specifications,” Odesse readily explained, “Originally, we had the idea of attempting to accelerate her growth much like Project Deva, but the problem came from not being able to stabilize her aging. As such, subjects one to twelve all passed away from age-related complications and physical stress. Afterwards, we pivoted to attempting to create her as an adult from the start, but attempting to replicate her personality has been a challenge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thirteen to thirty-six were all deemed failures as well for one reason or another, be it from an unstable body or brain death, but we have been making progress! In fact, if you wish Lady Bias, you could take one of these and have them act as your sister! It would greatly help my research.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Bias had thoughts. She had a lot of thoughts. She had to actively force down her instinctive outrage at the idea that Odesse had murdered copies of her sister, but the rest of her thoughts were surprisingly less negative and more fascinated. “To be clear, are these clones of me, or clones of Pittacus?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Both, essentially. We did utilize samples from you, Lady Bias, but most of these were made with the remains we secured from the site of Lord Thales’s death.” Odesse sighed in disappointment. “It’s a shame the buzzards got to his own remains before we could properly secure them. Still, we did retain some samples for potential use, though that is off topic so I digress.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias made a small mental note of that, before refocusing. “Hm. I’m guessing her body wasn't intact enough to work with?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Unfortunately. Our predecessors in the Nemesis Project were quite fortunate to retrieve only slightly mutilated bodies, and even then they had several centuries to work on revitalizing them.” Odesse sighed. “It’s almost a shame Lord Myson and Lady Cleobulus decided the subjects would be better used as materials than their intended purpose as elite soldiers. We didn’t even get a chance to see them active.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He glanced at Shax, who was still looking curiously around the lab. “Though I suppose this result is still valid. How has Project Deva performed so far?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…well enough,” Bias muttered, her eyes still on the closest clone floating in its tube, “He brought me back, so I might be biased.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see–Wait, was that wordplay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias ignored the question. She stepped closer, looking directly into a face that was identical to her own. It almost looked like she was just sleeping in there…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The hiss of the door opening wasn’t enough to distract her. Then Shax excitedly exclaimed “Papa Myson!” and she felt herself tense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Shax–Huh. This is unexpected,” Myson remarked as Bias turned to face him, “I thought you were dead, Bias.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So did I,” she replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson smiled. “And you’re well enough to joke too. You must be feeling quite good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve felt better.” Such as before he showed up. “What do you want?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s no need to be rude, Bias. Can’t I come by to check on your recovery?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You just said you thought I was dead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So I did. Anyway, this is certainly an interesting place to find you,” he remarked while glancing over the sealed clones, “How long have you had this little project running?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias raised an eyebrow. “Odesse is the one running it. He said it was on your orders. He was even using your ‘specifications’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson blinked at her. “…of course he was. After all, returning your twin to you is a major priority.” He cleared his throat and turned his gaze fully towards the closest clone. “So these are all viable recreations of Pittacus?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s what I was trying to find out,” Bias stated, growing increasingly unimpressed with her supposed leader, “Odesse was just saying how it’s been tricky recreating her personality.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed!” Odesse chimed in, “While I am confident that we have successfully recreated the original body of Pittacus, right down to a programmed affinity for wind magic, there haven’t been any signs of true personality within the subjects we tested. Regrettably, it seems while they are sentient, they are not sapient.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s the difference?” Shax spoke up, sounding curious while Bias’s brow furrowed in thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sentience denotes an ability to perceive and feel. There is evidence that the subjects are capable of reacting to stimuli and even following basic orders. However, they show no signs of initiative or ability to </span>
  <em>
    <span>respond</span>
  </em>
  <span> rather than simply react. In essence, it is the difference between your leg jerking when tapped on the knee and you making the decision to kick someone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You used the bare minimum of programming for their cores then,” Bias noted, earning a nod from Odesse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course. We don’t want a secondary mind to grow within the core before Pittacus can properly revive within the body. It is a difficult thing, finding the right balance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It might help if Myson didn’t sabotage you,” Bias remarked, giving the sage in question an unimpressed look, “Pitt’s specialty was light magic, not wind magic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is? But…she was the sage of wind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, and Thales was the sage of light despite focusing on darkness and that Quake spell of his. In a world that made sense and didn’t have stupid political implications, Pittacus would’ve been the sage of light and Thales the sage of earth. But that’s now how it wound up working.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh. Well, that actually does ruin this entire batch.” Odesse turned towards the suspended clones, plainly frowning. “What a waste…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not necessarily,” Myson spoke up, looking thoughtful, “We could always repurpose them into troops for our–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, we’re not doing that,” Bias interrupted, “Odesse, Myson is right on one thing, they can be reused. So use them as lab assistants. If they are anything like Pittacus or me, they’ll be much more useful in that type of setting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm…well, I suppose they were made for you in the first place,” Odesse noted, looking thoughtful, “It’s only right you decide what they should be used for. And it would be useful to have assistants around…do you truly believe they would be better suited in this role? We do need combatants and you yourself are a very skilled mage.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I needed time to develop into what I am now. They should get time too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Time we don’t have,” Myson pointed out, earning a glare from Bias.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Time I’ll give them then. Like I said, Odesse, it’s what Solon did with me, and you can see how I turned out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You killed Solon, remember?” Myson drawled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias paused, because no, she didn’t remember that. She knew her mentor was dead, sure, but there was a disconnect…She shook the thought off. It wasn’t relevant. “My point still stands.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“True, you are very effective…and being compared to Lord Solon, well…” Odesse seemed to smile there, before nodding. “Very well then. I would prefer having assistants to soldiers anyway.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t change our problem though,” Myson pointed out, “Thanks to </span>
  <em>
    <span>your</span>
  </em>
  <span> loss at Mozghuz and Dolofonos’s failure to kill that brat they call an emperor, the deadlock we were in has broken in the Adrestians’ favor. So what are we going to do to counter them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias glowered at her fellow sage, then paused when Shax suddenly spoke up. “Ah, Papa Myson, I actually do have an idea. Well, it’s Lady Bias’s idea, but I think it’s a good one!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Myson raised an eyebrow, though his gaze was on Bias instead of Shax. “And what idea was that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s pretty simple,” Shax continued, oblivious to his creator’s ire, “What if I got more crests?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That drew Myson’s attention. “…excuse you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, you know, since I already have that crest of flames thing, what if we put more crests in me? We have the blood of the ten elites, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias winced. “Uh, Shax, that’s not–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s an interesting idea, Shax,” Myson interrupted, a small smile coming to his face, “Do you think you could handle it? As we’ve seen with the beasts, adding more than one crest to a creature tends to have unpleasant effects.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but I’m Agarthan! I’m better than that!” he said brightly and carelessly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I suppose you are…very well then. I’ll see if a project is viable, given the resources we have. Cleobulus has most of the materials we need if we really do want to use all of the elites, but…perhaps there are other ways to enhance you, Shax.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy beamed. “Awesome! You hear that, Lady Bias? I’m going to be even better!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…that’s great, Shax,” Bias replied, though she couldn’t quite muster up a smile for him, “Could you give me a second though? I need to talk to Myson about our plans going forward.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh, sure! You do that! I’ll just…talk with Odesse, I guess?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, good, I was hoping I could have someone to bounce ideas off of,” Odesse stated, grabbing onto Shax’s shoulder and steering him away, “Now then, what do you think about possible biological enhancements for these subjects now that–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Come on,” Bias requested, inclining her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson smirked, then followed her out of the lab and into the well-lit hallway. “I’m surprised you wanted to discuss ‘our’ plans. It was my understanding that you were content to follow orders.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The circumstances changed. What are you planning to do with Shax?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you attached to the deva?” he asked, sounding amused, “Is this a platonic attachment? Perhaps a sort of…maternal instinct has awakened? Or is it–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Answer my question.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson chuckled. “Why are you so aggravated? You’re the one that proposed the deva should be further enhanced. Truthfully, I should have considered the idea sooner. His current form might be useful, but imagine if he had the physique of his source.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias grimaced. “You were the one that decided Nemesis would be more useful as materials than as a weapon.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can admit mistakes. Though I wouldn’t say this was one. A being with the loyalty of a perfect Agarthan soldier, mixed with the magic of the Great Sage and the malice of the Fell Star, all embodied within a hulking behemoth of a warrior…” His grin was sharp. “Doesn’t that sound just perfect?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would he even keep his mind?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course he will, that’s the point. It’s not as though the mind of Nemesis is active within him.” His smile turned thoughtful. “Though I do have a mission planned for him already…it should be fine. I’ll send him out with Aegir and in the meantime I can prepare for his metamorphosis.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias’s frown deepened. “His body is already grown. You’d be altering his entire skeletal structure and muscular systems, not to mention how his organs would have to–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And?” Myson interrupted, an eyebrow raised. “He’s a fast-grown vatborn. How long do you think he’ll last without modification? It’s better we get enough use out of him now than wait for him to age into uselessness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>stable</span>
  </em>
  <span>–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now, certainly. In the future…well, I don’t exactly need him to last longer than the length of this war.” He waved a hand dismissively. “It barely matters anyway. The blood of the Fell Star will either keep him stable or lead to his degradation. Better we use him while we have him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias narrowed her eyes. “He calls you ‘papa’.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His eyebrow raised again. “You say that as though it should mean something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…I’ll go along with him,” Bias decided, “You need him for this project, so I can–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I have a different plan in mind,” Myson interrupted, “Shax’s suggestion reminded me that we have allies to call upon. Ones who really should be willing to give it their all to defend our ancestral homeland.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Who are you…oh. You want me to speak with Cleobulus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good, your mind is still working well enough to make obvious inferences.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off. You want to beg her for help because we’re screwed otherwise.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Language. You don’t want to influence Shax to be as crass as you, now do you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias clenched her fist, the pop of her knuckles keeping her centered in the moment even as she buried her urge to press a hand to Myson’s smug face and start </span>
  <em>
    <span>cooking</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “Alright. I’ll run and get Cleo so you can hide beneath her skirts. But let’s make something very clear, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lord</span>
  </em>
  <span> Myson.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stepped closer, smoke beginning to leak from her clenched fist. “I’ll play along with whatever bullshit you want to put forward, because you’re right. I do care about Shax now. Just like I care about Pittacus. In fact, I’d put the two on a close enough level that I would be very, </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> unhappy if you hurt either of them. So let’s make things clear: The second you make a threat towards Pittacus, even if it’s just her copies, or toward Shax, I will burn you. I will burn you right down to the bone until I hear your marrow </span>
  <em>
    <span>boil.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Are we understood?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Myson’s smile dropped. His eyes narrowed and he scowled, for once showing the aggravation he felt. “So those are your limits then? Fine. Then I’ll make something very clear to </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Bias. Your only value to me was as a weapon and a test subject, and the moment you failed, you should have been left in the dirt. The only reason you are alive is because that boy you are attached to is too stupid to realize you’re worthless. That, and the fool I left in charge here. The original Odess would have known to let you die on that operating table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But since you are here, let me be clear once more: Do as I say, or I’ll rip your heart from your chest with my bare hand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” It was funny. Normally, insults like that would have set her off. She would have burnt the scowl straight off of Myson’s face without a second thought. And yet, for some reason she couldn’t explain, Bias smirked. “Then we understand each other. Be good to our people while I’m gone, </span>
  <em>
    <span>my lord</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bias gave a mock bow then turned and left, ignoring Myson’s glare as it bore into her back. She had better things to do than play along with his bullshit.</span>

  <p>No battle could satiate the Death Knight. Not once during the years of war he had fought had the monster born of blood thirst felt a rush comparable to the battle against the Ashen Dragon and the Blade Breaker, the moment he had nearly perished in brutal combat. He still remembered the Blade Breaker’s spear piercing through his body, and he yearned to once again feel that pain.</p><p> </p><p>The so-called “Tyrants” he faced on the fields of Varley were nothing more than mindless beasts made from rotted corpses. There was no joy to be had in killing an opponent who had died long ago, no matter how viciously the creatures battled.</p><p> </p><p>Even so, he continued to battle in the bloodied fields outside Varley’s capital. It wasn't enough to quench his thirst, but it served its purpose. Blood soaked the ground, feeding the worms within. His scythe still gleamed, eager for more. He felt that hunger, that thirst, deep in his belly. A craving for split flesh and rent gore.</p><p> </p><p>The Jeritza part of his mind briefly considered taking up poetry before the Death Knight rallied in a brutal swing that cleaved the head of a dead man from its shoulders. Immediately, his gaze turned to the rest of the ruined field, seeking out a new foe, though…had he truly massacred all of the foes set against him? It was a shame if so. He wanted to continue feeling blood splash against his armor…</p><p> </p><p>Yet in the absence of prey, the Death Knight subsided and Jeritza took a slow breath through his helm. He would need to clean his equipment again. The Death Knight truly was a terrible entity; not only did he embody the hideous bloodlust the lurked within Jeritza’s heart, but he truly had no concept of how inconvenient it was to maintain equipment properly. </p><p> </p><p>Dried blood was such a pain to get off of metal! It clumped and flaked! It was like the Death Knight wanted their equipment to rust…</p><p> </p><p>He shook the thought off before urging the Death Horse forward. He had more work ahead of him if the battle was not yet won, though he wouldn’t be surprised if the horns of victory had already blown and the Death Knight noticed not in the throes of slaughter.</p><p> </p><p>Castle Varley stood in the distance, still flying the false flags of Aegir’s faction. The Death Knight stirred for a moment, his attention garnered by the idea of their master allowing him to put the traitor to death. Jeritza ignored that idea though; more than likely, the young Aegir would be prompted to do the deed to affirm his loyalty. It would be cruel, but the reality of politics often were.</p><p> </p><p>The army had split again, their forces dividing between the mountains and the coast. He, along with Emperor Edelgard and the Ashen Dragon, who the Death Knight only avoided lunging for because his master had glared at him, had taken a portion of their forces to seize Varley alongside the Reclaimers, those knights of the church whose white armor looked disgustingly pure on what should be a field of blood and ruin. Their goal was to unite with the forces at Garreg Mach, such that the church could be properly utilized against their treacherous foes.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, the Violet Demon and the loyal Aegir would seize Boramas, and the lands of Hrym would be caught between the jaws of the Imperial Army, to be ripped apart at her imperial majesty’s leisure. It was a brutal plan, one befitting the emperor that would change the world–</p><p> </p><p>“MAY THE GODDESS GRANT YOU A PEACEFUL REST!”</p><p> </p><p>…now if only those plans didn’t involve allowing his older sister to fight on the battlefield.</p><p> </p><p>Mercedes, meanwhile, was having a perfectly pleasant time on the battlefield as she delivered the goddess’s judgement unto the monsters Her foes chose to bring forth into the world. The sacred weapon within her grasp shone with a holy light as she launched arrow after arrow through the bodies of the undead creatures named for their tyranny, the Tathlum Bow practically singing as its string strummed like a harp’s. It was made to slay monsters, and the fulfillment of its purpose brought forth a joy that Mercedes could practically feel.</p><p> </p><p>If one were to ask the elder of the Bartels siblings if she had a second personality within herself, a sort of “Death Knight” of her own, she would likely be confused by the question. Certainly, she could feel more…invigorated while within battle than she would have been, once upon a time, but that had been true ever since she received the goddess’s divine revelation, all those years ago at the academy. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t as though she had a voice speaking within her head, merely that she had a better sense of how the enactment of violence upon a vile enemy was as much a way of embracing the goddess’s will as healing her friends was. She still had a kind heart and cared deeply for the lives of those around her. That care was the very reason <em> why </em> it was so necessary that she put an arrow through the head of a Hrymian soldier; it ended the poor man’s suffering as he fought for a false cause, and that was just as much a kindness as giving him a cookie would have been.</p><p> </p><p>Wasn’t it better to send him into the goddess’s embrace than to leave him to the cruel fate of being denied Her warmth? It was a <em> kindness. </em></p><p> </p><p>Besides, if Mercedes did happen to have a more zealous personality that pushed forth during moments of battle or preaching, then she wouldn’t be called a “Death Knight”, now would she? Sylvain joked once that she would be a “Life Knight” when he thought she didn’t hear him, but that title was absolutely not a correct description.</p><p> </p><p>After all, she hadn’t been formally knighted.</p><p> </p><p>Mercedes paused in her ruminations as she heard the sound of hoofbeats on the pavement. Her gaze flicked towards the potential danger, before her gaze softened the moment she saw her brother in his eerie armor. “Oh, Emile, there you are! I didn’t realize we were both on this side of the battlefield.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I did not expect to cross paths with you either, Mercedes.” While his horse remained steady and stalwart, her brother shifted in his saddle, as though nervous. “You should not be on the battlefield. It is a dangerous place.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I need to be here, Emile. I can’t just let my friends fight without me,” Mercedes replied, before she continued with a slight increase in fervor, “Besides, it is the will of the goddess that we bring a righteous judgement down upon those who would betray her followers and bring these foul perversions of life and death into the world.”</p><p> </p><p>“You sound like the church knights when you speak like that, Mercedes…”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, do you dislike it?” she asked with a genuine concern, “I hope I haven’t been making you uncomfortable. It’s just…we need to fight to save the people of our homeland. I know it’s been a long time since I lived in the empire, but it feels…right, being back here and fighting to save it.”</p><p> </p><p>Jeritza wasn’t good with words. He didn’t know how, exactly, to explain that it wasn’t his sister’s words that were concerning him, but her actions. He didn’t like seeing her kill people, as hypocritical as that thought was, and he really didn’t like seeing her put herself in danger, even if she was surprisingly deadly with that bow.</p><p> </p><p>“...You should focus on healing our wounded,” he said, defaulting to the first thing he could think of, “It would help more. Especially if you were back at camp.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, don’t worry, I’ve made sure to heal everyone I see get injured,” Mercedes readily replied, “It’s actually better for me to be on the battlefield as a healer, since it means I can get to them more quickly. Daisy is very helpful for moving quickly across the field.” She patted her steed’s armored head for emphasis, earning a proud snort from the bulky war horse.</p><p> </p><p>Jeritza would have said more, but both he and Mercedes went still as they heard war horns blow thrice in the distance. A signal from the Imperial Army, declaring enemy reinforcements were approaching.</p><p> </p><p>In an instant, the Death Knight rose once more. “THE HORNS OF WAR CALL FOR ME. THIS TALK IS POINTLESS. STAY OUT OF MY WAY OR MEET MY BLADE.”</p><p> </p><p>He began to turn before the barest giggle made him still. “Do not worry, I will not impede you. The Goddess’s work must be done, little brother.”</p><p> </p><p>With that, his sister urged her own horse forward, riding ahead of him with arrows already nocked to her bow. The Death Knight huffed under his breath, then followed in the zealot’s wake, keen to spill the blood of those foolish enough to face his blade.</p><p> </p><p>Hopefully his sister wouldn’t kill the interesting opponents before he could get to them…</p><hr /><p>Byleth had to admit, she never actually expected to come back to Castle Varley. She remembered coming through the main gates and walking the exact same path of well-cared for hedges with her father and sister. It was the first castle she had ever been inside, but the most she remembered from that day, all those years ago, was how Count Varley stood above them and literally looked his nose down at her family.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t really understand emotions back then, not in the same way she could express them now. If she had to sum up her experience, she would have called it…annoying. Though even then, it was less because Count Varley had cheated them on payment and made them walk all that way for nothing, and more that he’d been rude to her father.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t matter now though. Count Varley was long dead according to Edelgard, all thanks to a group of Agarthan assassins being given the wrong noble to target. In a way, it was a sort of justice that his life would come to an end at the uncaring hands of those he betrayed the empire to support.</p><p> </p><p>Which made it very weird that a man calling himself Count Varley was kneeling right in front of them with his hands bound.</p><p> </p><p>To be clear, the kneeling and bound hands weren’t the weird part. Byleth had broken into the castle’s inner sanctum alongside Edelgard and captured the apparent commander of the enemy forces, so it made perfect sense that said commander would be restrained for capture. </p><p> </p><p>It was just really weird that he looked exactly like Count Varley.</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Thankfully, Edelgard was just as confused as her former professor, and asked the question that was on both of their minds. “Why in the world would you choose to pose as Gregoire von Varley? You do realize he’s been dead for years now?”</p><p> </p><p>“...” The imposter didn’t respond, instead keeping very calm and very still.</p><p> </p><p>“We are going to interrogate you, Agarthan. The only reason I am choosing to begin with this question instead of anything more actionable is that I am genuinely bewildered. That, and your choice of visage made Bernadetta faint.”</p><p> </p><p>That was also something Byleth was concerned about. Bernadetta had already been anxious from being back in her childhood home, so it was understandable that seeing her father’s ‘ghost’ would make her react badly. </p><p> </p><p>Dorothea was taking care of her at the moment, which left Byleth and Edelgard to handle the interrogation. Speaking of, Byleth should contribute.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell us,” she bluntly demanded, which made the man flinch for some reason. Maybe it was the blood on her armor?</p><p> </p><p>“...It was Lord Myson’s order that I impersonate the flesh I wear,” the Agarthan muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard frowned. “What do you mean Myson ordered it? Why would he do that?”</p><p> </p><p>The Agarthan closed his eyes and muttered a prayer to gods long dead. “He…felt annoyed that he…that his subordinates made a mistake in their choice of targets. As such, he declared that I should be Varley in his place, despite it already being well known that Count Varley had been assassinated, publicly at that.” </p><p> </p><p>Byleth could have sworn that the fake Varley almost sounded...annoyed there. </p><p> </p><p>“...He had you replace Varley because he was annoyed?” </p><p> </p><p>“Lord Myson tends to prefer keeping the same people around, even if only by name.” </p><p> </p><p>“What’s your real name?” Byleth asked, earning a blink from the Agarthan.</p><p> </p><p>“...why do you want to know, Fell Star?”</p><p> </p><p>“It doesn’t sound like you enjoy being Varley, and I want to know what your real name is,” she explained, before crouching to better look him in the eyes, “My name is Byleth.”</p><p> </p><p>“...I am Anacharsis.”</p><p> </p><p>She gave him a smile. “Thank you for telling me.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re…welcome?”</p><p> </p><p>Beside her, Edelgard cleared her throat. “Now then, Anacharsis, are you willing to answer our questions?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. I have failed to hold a key territory for my superiors. My life is already forfeit.” His eyes narrowed. “I have no intention of betraying my people. My one request is that my death be quick.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard nodded. “That is about what I expected to hear. At least you didn’t try cursing us in some stupid act of defiance like the last three Agarthan commanders…Hapi, please see to it that Anacharsis is transported to the cells at Fort Merceus.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure thing, Eddy,” the redhead replied, standing up from the chair she’d been relaxing on, “Before I do though, can we get him to take the Varley face off? Otherwise he’ll scare Bernie-Bee again, and she gets really loud when she shrieks.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard tried not to sigh as she glanced at the man, who in turn did sigh, before the familiar swirl of Agarthan magic surrounded him, revealing the man beneath. Edelgard had to admit, she could somewhat understand why this man was chosen in Varley’s place given his rather thin and gaunt appearance, though he lacked the same facial hair. </p><p> </p><p>“You truly intend to take me prisoner?” Anacharsis asked, raising an eyebrow. “I was under the impression capture meant execution.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope. Eddy’s official policy is that you pale guys get the same rights that other enemy leaders would get when captured,” Hapi casually explained, before gesturing at the Agarthan, “Up.”</p><p> </p><p>Anacharsis frowned at her, then did his best to stand up with his hands still bound. “Why? We are not like you beasts. The Agarthan people–“</p><p> </p><p>“Are a bunch of really pale people who think they’re better than everyone else,” Hapi finished, unimpressed, “As far as I’m concerned, the only difference between you guys and the knights of Faerghus is that you’re slightly whiter. Now stop complaining about getting to sit out the war and come on.”</p><p> </p><p>Anacharsis grumbled some unflattering things under his breath, but still followed Hapi readily enough, leaving Edelgard and Byleth behind in the office.</p><p> </p><p>The moment they were alone, Edelgard let out a sigh and leaned against what had been Count Varley’s desk. “One step closer to victory…now if only the rest of the Agarthan leadership would be as reasonable about surrendering.”</p><p> </p><p>“Would you be okay with accepting their surrender if they did?” Byleth asked as she moved beside the young emperor and sat on the desk with her, “They’ve done terrible things to you.”</p><p> </p><p>“They have. They've done a great deal of harm to a number of people, our friends included.” Her brow furrowed, a frown coming to her face. “We will be dealing with genuine monsters from this point onward. Not inexperienced youths forced into leadership or reluctant commanders made to wear false faces…though, we’ll have to investigate Anacharsis. If it turns out he’s been experimenting on the populace or allowing people to be stolen away by his superiors…</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard let out a frustrated sigh. “It would be easier if I could see them as all monsters, but Hapi was correct. There are more differences than skin tone, but at their core, the worst Agarthan is the same type of person as the worst Adrestian. Cruel, self-centered, and obsessed with their claims of superiority. So how can I justify treating them differently?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm. I don't think I'm an expert in this, but I don't think anyone would blame you for treating them differently because of your experiences with them. Sure they might be the same type of person as the worst Adrestian, but they’ve done worse things, right? They had the opportunity to do better like Kronya and chose to do worse instead.” </p><p> </p><p>“To be fair, I doubt many had their guard lowered because of your sister,” Edelgard noted as she pushed off the desk, “Even so, if I'm to make a better future, I can't just execute prisoners of war. Which means I’ll need to figure out what to actually do with them after the fighting ends.” </p><p> </p><p>“I'm sure you'll make the right choice when it comes down to it. You don't like Rhea, but you're willing to work with her.” </p><p> </p><p>“I doubt Rhea would appreciate a family member of hers equating her with the Agarthans,” Edelgard dryly noted.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine. I’m her favorite so she’ll let me get away with it,” Byleth stated quite primly, earning an amused noise from Edelgard. Though before the pair could continue their conversation, their attention was drawn towards the room’s door as it opened up to let in a familiar blonde.</p><p> </p><p>“Lady Edelgard–Oh, excellent, you’re here too, professor,” Constance greeted, her expression more serious than usual, “I have important news that needs to be brought to your attention as soon as possible!”</p><p> </p><p>“...” Edelgard glanced at Byleth, then looked back at her former classmate. “And that information would be…?”</p><p> </p><p>“Our scouts have spotted the Kingdom’s forces approaching from the north!”</p><p> </p><p>That made Edelgard immediately go stiff. “What? How did they get here so quickly!? Garreg Mach should have been in the way–I thought Dimitri and his allies were holding the monastery!?”</p><p> </p><p>“Er, yes? I meant Dimitri’s forces.” Constance frowned, tapping her chin with her fan. “Hm. I can see where I caused some confusion there. It doesn’t help that both sides of the Kingdom conflict are using blue for their heraldry…”</p><p> </p><p>“That probably makes things confusing on the battlefield,” Byleth noted as Edelgard sighed. </p><p> </p><p>“Constance, I ask that the next time you report something that you make sure to be specific.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, I'll certainly be sure to keep that in mind, but would it truly matter in any other situation?” </p><p> </p><p>“What about if Aegir showed up trying to ambush us?” Byleth suggested, “In that case, saying ‘Imperial forces are arriving’ would slow down our response.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hm, I can see your point. Thank you professor! I suppose there are still things I have to learn from you!” Constance stated, before letting out a haughty laugh. </p><p> </p><p>Edelgard wanted to sigh again, but she had more important things to deal with right now than expressing her annoyance. “Fine. We’ll send a messenger to make sure these really are Dimitri’s forces and to set up a meeting on our terms. It would be inconvenient to say the least if we have to work around the Kingdom and the Church–…oh damn it all…”</p><p> </p><p>“Edelgard?” Byleth frowned, concerned by the emperor’s sudden frustration. “What’s wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>“Byleth, where are Rhea and Seteth?“</p><p> </p><p>“They should be leading the church’s forces in battle towards the northern point of–Oh. I see the problem.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard let herself groan, fully feeling the weight of her crown. “I swear, if either of those two try to re-establish ties with the Kingdom to form a coalition against me, I am going to…” She took a breath. “Think very carefully about what I will do because they are still your relatives, my teacher.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s fine, we can beat them up,” Byleth allowed, “I’ve punched Rhea in the jaw before. It might be fun to do it again.”</p><hr /><p>Rhea paused as a strange phantom pain began to make her jaw ache, before she took a sip of her tea to soothe it. Chamomile was a personal favorite of hers, so it was nice getting to have some while Seteth chattered with Dimitri and his entourage.</p><p> </p><p>“–of course, we will need to reestablish our footing at Garreg Mach before we commit to your campaign,” Seteth stated, nodding to Dimitri and those friends of his. Rhea recognized Yuri, of course, and the large boy with the dark complexion was the one from Duscur. The rest of them though…well, it had been three years and she already had so many names to keep track of in her head, so she could be forgiven for a lapse.</p><p> </p><p>“That isn’t an issue. Garreg Mach is the church’s domain, it is only natural that we return it to you,” Dimitri readily agreed, “We only hope that you're willing to allow us to use it as a base until we establish a forward camp in the kingdom.” </p><p> </p><p>Thankfully the blue-haired swordsman and the blonde knight had left the tent earlier, so Rhea didn't have to worry about their names. Especially since Seteth seemed far more eager to take a hold of this conversation. </p><p> </p><p>“Garreg Mach will always welcome those who mean it no harm,” Rhea stated, setting her cup down. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Lady Rhea,” Dimitri said, smiling at her. </p><p> </p><p>“Now then, while the Church cannot commit yet to any specific course of action, we would like to discuss what will happen to the Kingdom once the usurper Rufus is dealt with,” Seteth stated, frowning deeply, “Not to mention how many nobles sided with him. Even those who bent the knee in an attempt to protect their land shouldn't be let off easy.” </p><p> </p><p>“I understand. I believe the most important thing to do is to restore and support the major houses so we can avoid creating too much instability–” Dimitri paused as the tent flap was pushed up by one of the guards outside.</p><p> </p><p>“Your majesty, uh…” The knight went stiff, visibly uncomfortable once he realized he’d interrupted his king. Still, he rallied valiantly enough to actually get his words out. “The Adrestian emperor is here to see you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Edelgard? Why does she want to speak with me?” the young king asked, visibly confused.</p><p> </p><p>“Because you’re holding a meeting with my so-called ally within Imperial territory,” Edelgard bluntly stated as she brushed past the knight.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, wait, you can’t–” And said knight very quickly found his wrist caught before he could try to stop Edelgard from entering.</p><p> </p><p>“No touching,” Byleth stated, before releasing the knight’s wrist and nudging him out of the way and back into irrelevance. “Hi Dimitri, hi Yuri, hi Dedue.”</p><p> </p><p>“...hello Professor,” Dimitri greeted, his advisors echoing him with varying levels of amusement and bemusement, “Edelgard, is there an issue here?”</p><p> </p><p>“That depends entirely on you and Rhea,” Edelgard bluntly stated, crossing her arms over her chest as the former archbishop in question blinked at the unexpected hostility, “What are you discussing?”</p><p> </p><p>“All we are discussing is how we’ll take Faerghus back from the usurper sitting on its throne,” Dimitri explained with a placating gesture, “Seteth and I simply want to ensure things return to normal as quickly as possible.”</p><p> </p><p>That made the young emperor’s eyes narrow. “‘Normal’. Should I take that to mean you intend to restore Faerghus and the Church of Seiros to their previous status?”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri frowned, a dark look crossing his gaze. “Not completely. The nobles that have chosen to follow my uncle will need to be dealt with. I fully intend on executing those involved in my uncle’s treason, and even the ones who have chosen to support him out of fear will need to pay reparations for their cowardice.”</p><p> </p><p>“But that comes later,” Yuri spoke up with an easy smile, “Right now, we were talking about how to get the throne. We weren’t planning some kind of secret pact against the empire.”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri blinked, darkness replaced by bewilderment. “Wait, is that–Edelgard, I swear to you, I have no intention of striking at the Empire! Why would you even think that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Certain individuals here have disagreed with my choices in the past. It made me wonder if they might be seeking a more…compliant partner,” she responded, her eyes turning towards Seteth in a full glare. Her gaze was so intense, it almost felt like she was glaring at Rhea too. But that was silly.</p><p> </p><p><em> Obviously I haven’t done anything wrong here, so she can’t be mad at me, </em> the ancient Nabatean idly thought as she sipped her tea again.</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard’s frown deepened while Seteth let out a sigh. “Emperor Edelgard, I understand that you and I have had…disagreements on how this war should be conducted, but I am only thinking of the security of Fodlan as a whole. We need to restore the Church of Seiros as a rallying point for all those who would seek solace from the horrors the Agarthans would unleash upon us. Garreg Mach is already being used as a place for refugees, correct? Then it is the church’s responsibility to return to prominence so those people may be protected.”</p><p> </p><p>“I disagree,” the emperor retorted, “I have no intention of supporting the Central Church in any return to prominence.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Dimitri blinked. “Wait, El–No, I mean, Edelgard. What do you mean you don’t support the return of the church? You’re working with the church’s remnants, just as we are.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I am not. I was operating under the assumption that the ‘reclaimers’, as they call themselves, were our allies in the fight against Hrym, and yet here they are, attempting to undercut our entire alliance by forming a pact with you!”</p><p> </p><p>“We had no intention of undercutting you, your imperial majesty,” Yuri interceded in a very polite tone, “There’s no reason we can’t all be friends here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly,” Dimitri agreed, “We’re all working towards the same goal, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“I am <em> not </em> putting <em> her </em> back into power!” Edelgard retorted, which was strange given the only women in this discussion were her, Byleth, and…wait.</p><p> </p><p>“One moment,” Rhea spoke up, frowning, “Who said I was being put back into power?”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri paused. “Hold on, Lady Rhea, weren’t we just discussing–”</p><p> </p><p>“Pardon me, your majesty,” Seteth interrupted, before turning his gaze to the woman he swore his loyalty to all those centuries ago, “Lady Rhea, I understand you have some reservations about the current state of the church and your position in it, but you have to understand, you are an important part of the church’s structure. Having you return to your position as archbishop is key to stabilizing Fodlan–”</p><p> </p><p>“But I don’t want to,” Rhea bluntly responded, still frowning.</p><p> </p><p>“L-Lady Rhea?!” Dimitri looked like he had been hit by the full force of her blunt response and was reeling from the impact.</p><p> </p><p>“For countless years I've been leading Fodlan, and made mistake after mistake in a paltry attempt to keep the peace and keep myself safe. The time spent trapped might have been agonizing, yet they were also the most liberating years of my life, no longer needing to worry about lords attempting to rebel or nations splintering off over petty disagreements.” </p><p> </p><p>Seteth winced, glancing at the Faerghans. “Ah, Lady Rhea, maybe you shouldn’t–”</p><p> </p><p>But Rhea wasn’t having that. “No, I’m not about to keep my mouth shut about this anymore! Faerghus has been a pain in my ass for centuries by this point! I didn’t want the Empire to split up! I don’t like war! But that blond prick of a count thought he should be king and threw a damn fit that ruined everything I built up! And I’m not going back to being archbishop just so the land of rebels can feel better about being traitors to every oath they swore!”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not–Lady Rhea–”</p><p> </p><p>“Would you stop calling me ‘Lady’ already!? I am no longer the archbishop, I do not want to be the archbishop–In fact, the archbishop position is now officially dissolved! If you demand I wield my authority then <em> fine </em> , here I am, wielding it properly! No one may ever hold the title ‘archbishop’ again without being a direct heretic of the church’s teachings! As far as I am concerned, the only authorities left in the churches are the bishops of the Eastern and Southern churches, and they can figure out what that authority means <em> on their own. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>She sat back down with an irritated huff, ignoring the stunned stares directed her way. Even Edelgard looked caught off guard by the sudden tirade, sharing a glance with Byleth.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know about this?” she asked, raising an eyebrow at her former professor.</p><p> </p><p>“Yup. I guess you two haven’t had a chance to talk about it yet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hm…I suppose I should have taken the time to.”</p><p> </p><p>“You did have a lot of other stuff to handle,” Byleth commiserated, before glancing over at Dimitri and Yuri, who seemed to be very busy discussing things in hushed voices. Something about ‘legitimacy’ and ‘losing claims’.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t seem immediately relevant to Byleth, so she turned her attention to the remaining Lion in the tent. “How have things been with you, Dedue? I didn’t see you when Shez and I visited the monastery.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, yes, I was out aiding the villagers under our protection at the time,” Dedue replied, trying to ignore the immense awkwardness in the air as he kept a hand on Dimitri’s shoulder in an attempt to steady him, “My apologies for not greeting you sooner. To tell the truth, I was unaware that you had even returned, professor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? Dimitri didn’t tell you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I believe his majesty was distracted with other matters at the time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nobody else mentioned it?”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought the king here would, so I didn’t,” Yuri commented casually, turning his attention away from his flustered king, “Sorry about that, big guy.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s no trouble. And, if I may, Lady Rhea?” The former archbishop glanced up at the ridiculously tall man, a frown still on her face. “I know it may not be my place to say so, but…the Kingdom has its faults, yet good people still live within it. You shouldn’t abandon them because you are weary of our position.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did I say I was abandoning anyone?” Rhea retorted, allowing more of her annoyance to show, “I dislike war, but I will still fight against the Agarthan scourge plaguing these lands.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then…what will become of the kingdom?” Dimitri asked, focusing back on the former archbishop.</p><p> </p><p>“...” Rhea stared at Dimitri for a moment, before letting out a sigh, “Now is not the time to discuss such matters, but I'll say this to you, Edelgard: attempting to take back all the land of the Kingdom will only lead to more war from the Faerghan nobles attempting to maintain their independence. Whether or not the Empire is willing to keep the war going isn't up to me.” </p><p> </p><p>“I seem to recall you were the one who declared Faerghus is no longer a legitimate nation,” Edelgard pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“I did do that, yes, and you may take it as justification to conquer their lands as Wilhelm once did against the forces of Nemesis.” Rhea folded her hands in her lap, focusing all her attention on the young woman. “There is a reason why Seiros spared the children of the elites, however. Violence breeds violence, and choosing to continue that war would have risked destroying every gain we secured. It was better to make heroes out of monsters than to bleed the entire continent until nothing remained. Mercy can destroy an enemy by making them an ally.”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri winced, not happy to hear his ancestor be called a monster, but Edelgard still frowned. “Being ruthless is a type of mercy too. It spares you and those who follow after from the harm your ‘allies’ cause when they become enemies again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps. If Seiros had gone on to wipe out the bloodline of the elites, then Fodlan as we know it would look very different. I doubt there would be an intact empire though. One cannot slaughter a people without consequences, and there will always be those who remain after, missed by the purge and harboring hate in their hearts. A hate I could not deny as being righteous, for there is no pain greater than to be the last of your family.” She noticed Dedue’s face tightening at her words, the same as Edelgard and Dimitri.</p><p> </p><p>Rhea took a slow breath, closing her eyes. <em> How many families have died because of this land I built? </em> She opened them again when she felt a hand on her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Should we talk about this later?” Byleth asked, keeping that steady hand on her.</p><p> </p><p>Rhea smiled. “No, I’ll be fine.” Then she turned her gaze back to Edelgard, whose expression was inscrutable. “I prefer peace. I know you have grand designs for how Fodlan should change, going forward. I will not interfere in whatever you choose to do. I think you are kinder than you give yourself credit for though. Seiros still slew the elites themselves. No prisoners were taken there.”</p><p> </p><p>“Er, really?” Dimitri spoke up, drawing attention back his way.</p><p> </p><p>“Well yes, obviously,” Rhea stated, frowning again, “I wasn’t about to let any of those butchers live peacefully after slaughtering my entire–“</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe we shouldn’t be discussing the deaths of Dimitri’s ancestors in front of him,” Byleth interrupted, giving both Rhea and Edelgard a reproachful look, “I think talking about the hypothetical destruction of his entire bloodline is also rude.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard winced. “Ah, right…my apologies, Dimitri, I was…getting carried away.”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri seemed like he had a few things to say on that subject, but then Yuri whispered in his ear and he let out a breath before laughing awkwardly. “There’s no need to apologize. I understand these were all hypothetical and you don’t actually believe my entire family history is evil and we deserve to have been wiped out, ha ha…”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not–Dimitri, I’m sorry, I didn’t intend to imply that.”</p><p> </p><p>“To be fair, the Blaiddyds always have been troublemakers,” Rhea commented, frowning at the memories, “I swear, the whole family was obsessed with dark magic for centuries before Loog made the effort to repair their reputation, and even then he was probably the largest thorn in my backside because of his rebellion.” A thought occurred and she had to school her features to hide her mischievous smile. “In fact, did you know Loog only had one hand?”</p><p> </p><p>Dimitri blinked. “Wait, really? But he was one of the greatest knights of his age, how could he fight with a missing hand?”</p><p> </p><p>“There are workarounds to such a disability, but it doesn’t really matter since Loog only lost that hand after he became king. The lech smacked my rear when I visited his newly founded kingdom and I cut the offending hand off right then and there.” She tried not to laugh at the young king’s horrified expression. “It did leave quite a mess on the dining table–“</p><p> </p><p>“Rhea!” Seteth interrupted, cutting in on her fun as always, “Don’t lie to people about their own ancestors! Especially such an important historical figure!”</p><p> </p><p>She debated trying to keep the joke up, before choosing to pout instead. “It could have happened. You weren’t there.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know it didn’t because you have the exact same expression whenever you think you’re being funny! It’s been ages and yet you get that exact same ridiculous look as when you pushed Macuil off a cliff and insisted the wind tried to steal him!”</p><p> </p><p>“He shouldn’t have stolen my cookies,” Rhea stated primly, before cracking a smile at Edelgard’s disapproving frown, “Now now, don’t get upset on your friend’s behalf now. Else I might have to start telling entirely true stories about Seiros and Wilhelm.”</p><p> </p><p>To her credit, the emperor didn’t flinch. “You’re bluffing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rhea smirked. “He was utterly fascinated by my ears, you know? Always nibbling at them whenever we–“</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s stop talking about this,” Byleth requested, and Rhea smirked at the show of weakness.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know why you’re embarrassed, granddaughter, these are the types of things you should be hearing, especially if you plan to have children. Wilhelm and I were unfortunately incompatible, but things should work fine with you and Edelgard.”</p><p> </p><p>“…they should?” Her confusion was adorable.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course. After all, male Nabateans carry the eggs, so you should be able to–“</p><p> </p><p>“WE DO NOT!” Seteth snapped, and Rhea couldn’t stop herself from laughing at his completely red face, “S-STOP LAUGHING! Rhea, you can’t just–Don’t just <em> lie </em>–“</p><p> </p><p>“Wait…” Dimitri’s brow was furrowed. “Does that imply–“</p><p> </p><p>“It doesn’t imply anything because Rhea is <em> lying!” </em> Seteth insisted, before scowling at his cackling comrade, “Were you always this immature?!”</p><p> </p><p>“…” Edelgard watched the woman she once thought would be her greatest obstacle continue to laugh over her own stupid joke, then let out a sigh and turned to her old friend. “My apologies for acting so hastily and harshly, Dimitri. I made some rash assumptions.”</p><p> </p><p>“…Edelgard…El,” Dimitri began, his brow furrowed, “I don’t want to, but I have to ask. Do you intend to conquer Faerghus?”</p><p> </p><p>“I intend to change Fodlan. The old system of crest-based inheritance and nobility have failed the people of this land for too long. This war presents an opportunity for us to change the systems that govern us for the better.” She met his gaze evenly. “I don’t want to fight you. I do still regard you as a friend. However, I will do what I must to achieve my goals.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced at Rhea again, who was starting to contain her horrible sense of humor. “…I am open to negotiations. Perhaps we can discover a solution we both find palatable.”</p><p> </p><p>“How about we have those discussions later?” Yuri proposed while Dimitri thought things over, “It’ll let tensions cool and you and his majesty here can both fill in your respective retainers in on what’s going on.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can accept that,” Edelgard readily acquiesced, “Dimitri?”</p><p> </p><p>“…yes, I think that would be best,” he agreed, “And, ah, despite the circumstances, it is good to see you again, El.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s good to see you as well, Dee,” she replied with a small smile.</p><p> </p><p>“…” Rhea, meanwhile, was frowning again. “Edelgard, I can accept your dalliance with that Dorothea girl given Byleth’s affection for her, but I will be very cross with you if you cheat on her with this one.”</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me?” Edelgard asked, raising an eyebrow at Rhea. </p><p> </p><p>“I-I would do no such thing! Edelgard is like a sister to me!” Dimitri said, looking far more flustered over the idea. </p><p> </p><p>“I understand we were friends when we were young Dimitri, but saying that you see me as a sister is a bit much, no?” Glancing over at Dimitri, Edelgard raised an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“I don't think that's what you should be focusing on!” Dimitri insisted, getting her to chuckle. </p><p> </p><p>“What can I say? Seeing you like this reminds me of how fun it was to tease you when we were young. I remember how embarrassed you got when I thought you were a girl on our first meeting.” </p><p> </p><p>“Geh–I-I need to go now, there’s, ah…Felix. Doing things. Bye.”</p><p> </p><p>Edelgard had to smother her giggles as Dimitri hurried straight out of the tent, his ears turning pink. Dedue sighed, trying his best not to smile as well as he followed after his liege, while Yuri actually stuck around. </p><p> </p><p>“So, any chance I can get some elaboration on that ‘Nabatean males lay eggs’ thing?” he asked, earning an immediate glare from Seteth while Rhea burst out laughing again.</p><p> </p><p>She should go to these types of meetings more often. They were surprisingly fun.</p>

  <span>Castle Varley had settled into a type of peace now that the red flags of House Hresvelg flew above its walls. The dust had settled, the enemy defeated, and a certain group of Blue Lions now relaxed within the walls instead of waiting in a tent outside, set up in a proper lounge for them to meet in. Though “relaxed” probably wasn’t the right word to describe them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold on, Loog wasn’t even a duke?” Felix asked, “He was a count?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that really the most important thing to focus on here?” Ingrid complained, frowning at her friend, who had the audacity to roll his eyes at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think it’s relevant to ask if my ancestor Kyphon helped somebody rise above him. Making someone he outranked his new king seems like a stupid move.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not–Do we even know for sure if House Fraldarius even was a ducal house at the time? Maybe he rose in status too!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know because my family history has it recorded that we were dukes from the earliest days of the Empire and every official record agrees with that.” He frowned as a thought occurred. “Hold on, did you Blaiddyds steal our ancestral land?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not,” Dimitri replied, though his voice was more weary than argumentative, “Our lands were our own…but we did take a significant amount from House Lamine, who tried to stay loyal to the Empire and was routed and exiled for it.” He sighed. “Lady Rhea was willing to clarify, this time without any jokes…well, hopefully.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There was a House Lamine?” Ingrid asked, before wincing, “Um…should we mention that to Mercedes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I am debating that question with myself. It would probably be worse if she found out on her own, but…you’ve noticed she is spending a good deal of time around her brother lately.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ingrid frowned. “Why is that a problem? It makes sense she would want to spend time with her long lost brother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Her brother’s the Death Knight,” Felix snarked, earning another glare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know that! It’s just…Mercedes is a sweet girl, we shouldn’t assume bad things about her just because of who her brother is. And just because she’s been…enthusiastic about killing our enemies. And that is a point to remember, she hasn’t attacked anyone that wasn’t trying to kill us first.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She'd also probably get angry at us if she thinks we were intentionally keeping this a secret from her,” Sylvain pointed out. “And if she doesn’t, Annette would on her behalf.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why do you sound more scared of Annette?” Ingrid wondered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because between the two of them, I know Mercedes would be gentle if she killed me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Annette is very effective with a war hammer,” Felix added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ingrid raised an eyebrow. “Why do you sound proud of that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps we should get back to the topic at hand,” Dedue spoke up, standing by Dimitri’s side as always, “Do you believe Edelgard would attempt to conquer Faerghus after defeating her enemies in the Empire?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think it would be a smart move if she went for it,” Sylvain answered, his expression turning more serious, “She has the most justification she’s ever going to get. Rufus attacked first, he’s a usurper, and Rhea’s last big act as archbishop was declaring Faerghus as a whole a rebelling territory. If she wants to make Faerghus part of Adrestia again, now’s the right time to do it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It might not matter if </span>
  <em>
    <span>she</span>
  </em>
  <span> wants to conquer us,” Felix pointed out, “Adrestians have been clamoring to take Faerghus ‘back’ from the moment Loog declared independence. Now that they have a chance to, they’ll pressure her to attack even if she doesn’t want to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Imperial nobles aren’t known for their loyalty,” Ingrid grumbled, frowning, “If any of them do invade Faerghus, they’d probably keep whatever land they seize just because they can.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…I thought Yuri was supposed to be the cynical one,” Dimitri muttered, “None of you think Edelgard and the Empire would be content with returning our territories to us as friends and allies?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Edelgard might, but we can't forget that the Ministers launched a coup against her dad, and one of them is actively rebelling right now. It’s safe to assume they won’t stay loyal if they think they’d get a better deal,” Sylvain said, before grinning, “If I could, I'd work my charms on her, but I think Dorothea might stab me before I get the chance.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She is better with a sword than you might expect,” Felix commented, earning a sigh from Ingrid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you two always have to be so single-minded? We need to make some real plans for what we’re doing here!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well unless you’re willing to try seducing the emperor, I’m out of ideas,” Sylvain replied, “We don’t exactly have much to offer them. The Empire had more weapons, more food, and more manpower than the Kingdom did when things were normal. Right now, we’re a struggling army who already annoyed the Empire by trying to poach their allies. So what do we have that they could ever want?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...we have relics,” Felix noted with a serious expression.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What!?” Ingrid practically yelped, “Felix, you can’t be serious!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s the only thing we have that they could want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re not wrong,” Sylvain remarked, frowning, “It’s not a great idea though. We’d be giving up our only advantage if things do turn bad between us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You asked what we have that they could want. I answered. We don’t have many options when it comes to keeping things peaceful between us and the Empire. So unless Yuri manages to strike a deal with whatever he’s doing right now or anybody else thinks of something, trading the relics is our best bet for guaranteeing we have allies.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nobody looked happy with that thought. Least of all Dimitri, who openly sighed. “I suppose it’s too much to hope that my past friendship with Edelgard will move her heart?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“About that, how much time did you two spend with each other?” Sylvain asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, well…we didn’t meet up every day, exactly, but I believe I first met her…ten, maybe eleven years ago?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sylvain nodded. “Right, we’re doomed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha–Why would we be ‘doomed’??”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re betting on a friendship you had with a girl from over a decade ago. We’re doomed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C-Come now, it's not like she forgot about it! She still kept the knife I gifted her!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait, she's the one you gave a dagger to?!” Sylvain stared at his friend for a good few seconds, then nodded solemnly. “Alright, new plan. Dimitri, </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> have to seduce–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll give them Gautier territory.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–...I mean, my dad’s not going to like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll deal with that when we come to it,” Dimitri decided, before leaning back in his seat with a sigh, “To think, our best chance of taking back our Kingdom might require giving parts of it away…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wondered if Edelgard had to deal with these types of problems.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Edelgard had to admit, after almost having an aneurysm over the possibility of Rhea and Dimitri making a behind the scenes deal she felt strangely relaxed. Granted that was probably thanks to Dorothea giving a shoulder massage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wow, you feel tense,” Dorothea remarked, working her fingers as best she could into the emperor’s stiff shoulders, “Did things really go that badly with the Lions showing up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, actually. Things went better than I expected,” Edelgard replied, letting out a slow breath while she felt the tension leaving her body, “Seteth overstepped, but Rhea really isn’t interested in taking power again, as unbelievable as that sounds. As for Dimitri…well, it’s nice to see he’s doing well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? Didn’t you say you were worried about facing him again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well…I was prepared to have to fight him if he proved to be a danger to my goals. I didn’t want to, but I was prepared to. Now though, I feel…optimistic. Dimitri has shown himself to be open to negotiation and while I do still intend to change the system of governance across Fodlan, such that crests no longer hold sway over the lives of our people, it would be better if he remained in charge of Faerghus as an allied leader.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well you won't hear any complaints from me if that's the case.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, but I'm sure I'll hear plenty from nobles on both sides as we try to discuss a peace treaty…If nothing else I'll have to ask for Arianrhod to appease the Ministers.” She frowned. “I’ll have to see who can actually govern the city under that circumstance. Giving it to Bergliez gives him more territory than I’m comfortable with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Poldie does seem like the type to get a swelled head if he gets to have two castles,” Dorothea concurred, “And Waldie already has his own city too…hm. A part of me thinks it’s gauche to even be talking about bartering a city filled with people for political reasons, but another part of me can’t help but think Connie would love to have it…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do we really want to put Constance in charge of a major city?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We could always ask Monnie to keep an eye on her. Or just put Monica in charge in general.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard sighed. “Maybe…the problem is, I don’t want to just hand over leadership to a friend just because I like them. That defeats the whole point of ridding ourselves of the nobility in the first place.” Her brow furrowed.”Maybe I could require a test for the position of Arianrhod’s governor? I was already planning to require exams for the ministerial positions, so it could be a good way to find an appropriate leader…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you’re looking for a commanding officer for our next adventure, I can assure you I would be a more than worthy candidate!” Constance declared as she entered the room, fan in hand and a haughty smile at her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, we weren’t talking about that,” Edelgard plainly stated, slightly deflating her noble friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Well, regardless, I heard discussions of leadership, and as the heiress of House Nuvelle, I would like to present myself for your consideration!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that the only reason you’re here, Constance?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not at all! I also bring news once more of approaching envoys! From the Alliance this time!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? Why would they be getting involved?” Dorothea asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can think of a few reasons,” Edelgard grumbled as she pushed herself up, “We’ll have to spend some more time together later, Dorothea. Duty calls.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As it always does.” Dorothea sighed, then kissed her love on the cheek. “Try not to take on even more responsibilities this time, okay Edie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll try not to. I already feel like a glutton with how much is being piled on my plate…Constance, walk with me. Where is everyone else?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hapi and Bernadetta are with Yuri at the moment,” Constance readily reports, falling in step behind the emperor as she heads out, “He’s apparently in a reminiscing mood, talking on about our past friendships and how we should try to reunite the Wolves once more, never mind the fact that Bernadetta never was one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He might consider her an honorary one, given what I’ve heard of their past.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>A past he seemed to be using to try to bind Bernadetta closer to his side,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Edelgard mentally noted, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Even if Dimitri does turn out to be a reliable ally, I’ll have to keep an eye out for Yuri.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “What about Jeritza?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s with Mercedes and Professor Byleth, sweeping the rest of the castle for potential problems. Things do seem to be progressing fine on that front, though I swear Emile is avoiding me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I noticed he tends to wander off when you’re around. If I didn’t know better, I would say Jeritza gets nervous around women.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That does sound exactly like him,” Constance remarked, “Emile never seemed comfortable around anyone besides his sister in the first place…but still! He’s known me for years! He should know better than to cower in the presence of the illustrious Constance von Nuvelle!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard did her best not to roll her eyes. It was probably for the better that Ferdinand was leading the second army; he and Constance tended to encourage one another’s antics whenever they were in the same room, and if she remembered Lorenz’s attitude correctly, then she really didn’t want all three of them in the same room at the same time…</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>If one were to ask a common person in Fodlan what the greatest city in Adrestia was, they would tell the asker, without hesitation, that it was Enbarr, the Imperial capital. And if that person asked the follow-up question “what is the second greatest city in the Empire”, the common person would most likely answer “the Empire has more than one city?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Commoners are rarely educated beyond the basics.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But if one were to ask a slightly more worldly commoner, like a merchant or some such, they would more than likely answer “Fort Merceus”, which is one of many reasons why House Aegir has historically had something of a rivalry with House Bergliez.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suffice to say, Boramas wasn’t exactly the most famous city in the Empire compared to its contemporaries, but it was a very important one. A key port city alongside its far less famous sister city, Rusalka, which was mostly known for being on the common map of Fodlan and not much else, Boramas was a center of commerce and industry for the Empire’s eastern coast, which made its capture paramount to the Imperial loyalists.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ferdinand von Aegir, recently appointed general of the Empire’s secondary army, took a slow breath as he took in the walls of his home city from the encampment his troops had set up out of range of the city’s defenses. It had been some time since he returned to his birthplace, and seeing it now, with the orange banners of Hrym flying in the wind above it all, put a pit in his stomach deeper than any other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You doing okay, kid?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He started for a moment, then let out another breath as he glanced at the much older man standing at his side in the lookout tower. He put on his best smile, willing his nerves to settle. “Of course, General Jeralt! I, Ferdinand von Aegir, am doing perfectly fine! I am merely mentally preparing myself for the battle ahead!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt regarded him with an unimpressed stare. “Ferdinand, I have two kids. I can tell when I’m being lied to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That–It is not a lie! I am indeed preparing myself–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine if that’s what you’re doing. Hell, it’s a good thing. Sieges are rough work, and it’s good to get your head on straight before you make any big moves,” Jeralt stated, “I don’t think that’s what you’re doing though. There’s a difference between getting ready and getting lost in your own thoughts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” Ferdinand turned his gaze back to the walls. “...It is very likely I will kill my father today, General Jeralt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. It’s a real possibility,” Jeralt muttered, before letting out a sigh, “I don't recall ever doing business with him. What kind of man is he?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think if you were to ask anyone else, they would give a far from flattering idea of who he is, and sadly they wouldn't be wrong,” Ferdinand said, his hands tightening into fists, “But if there's any part of the man that I once admired still within him, then I can say for certain that if we meet on the battlefield, he won't surrender.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. I guess there’s something to respect there. Even a corrupt man can stand by his convictions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure I can even give him that respect. My father…he is cruel, he is a coward, and he has, more than once, run away from justice to protect his own life. To say he is standing by his convictions is affording him more honor than he deserves.” He heard something pop in his knuckles. “He could have stayed in the dungeons. He could have turned on the monsters he supported at any time! But he didn’t, and now…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to be the one to kill him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should. It should be me that puts an end to the misery he’s caused.” Ferdinand tried for a smile. “Doing so should finally assure Hubert of my complete loyalty to her majesty. Perhaps he’ll be less crabby then.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ve been fighting a war with him for three years, Ferdinand. I doubt Vestra thinks you’re about to turn traitor out of nowhere.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“General Jeralt, not to be rude, but Hubert thinks that about everyone. I wouldn't doubt if he has a contingency plan for everyone and anyone in case any of us turn traitor,” Ferdinand said before letting out a huff, “I can see it now. We've recently started getting along over tea and coffee so he could just as easily poison any tea leaves he prepares for me and I'd be none the wiser.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Didn't take you for a pessimist.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take it as you will, but I know Hubert.” Ferdinand shook his head with a grin. “Just as well as I know that as long as I never turn traitor, I'll have nothing to fear from him, and I have no intention of doing so.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt stared at the much younger man for a few more seconds, then let out a deep sigh. “Is it just your generation that’s this dramatic? I swear, people weren’t so…intense back in my day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“General Jeralt, I mean no offense, but from what I’ve heard from Shez, your day was back when people still used bronze weapons.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> old,” the old general complained, giving Ferdinand an annoyed look. One made worse by the simple fact that he couldn’t tell if the brat was joking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, to answer your question, General Jeralt, you have met General Bergliez. So I don’t think it’s just my generation that has a flair for the dramatic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt couldn't help but grumble, not wanting to argue over how Bergliez was far closer to Ferdinand’s generations than his. “Fine, then it’s an Adrestian thing to be overly flowery and dramatic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I feel I should take some offense, but the Empire is typically held as a center of the arts in Fodlan and Enbarr is quite famous for its opera companies…come to think of it, where are you originally from, General Jeralt? I don’t think you’ve ever said.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt glanced at Ferdinand, then did his best to keep his face neutral as a thought came to mind. It was probably stupid, but…well, even Rhea was being honest these days. “Hm…well, we’re about to go into battle together, so I guess I can tell you, Ferdinand. Just try not to let this slip, alright? It’s something I haven’t even told my kids.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ferdinand furrowed his brow. “You haven’t? Then…is it alright for you to share this secret with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine, kid. I know you won’t tell anyone. See, Shez might’ve joked about my age to you before, but I am a hell of a lot older than you’d think. In fact, back when I was born, there were actually four nations in Fodlan, not three.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ferdinand blinked. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s not something the church would tell you, but back in the day, Faerghus split into three. One of those thirds, the eastern part, would eventually seize independence again and become Leicester, but the western third was conquered again by Faerghus. For a time though, it was it’s own country, the nation of Mach, and ever since it was reabsorbed, the people there have resented Faerghus for stealing their freedom from them. Why do you think the Western Lords over there hate the royal family so much? It was Faerghus that stole their nation from them, so they’ve hated the royals ever since.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“W-What, General Jeralt, you understand what you're saying is too much to believe. How do you even know this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because I was part of the army who took back Mach for the Kingdom,” Jeralt explained, before shaking his head, “Granted, back then I was just a squire, so I didn't help out much, but I still fought.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That…I knew about the Crescent Moon war against the Alliance, but I wasn't aware that a second war had occurred as well.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Civil wars tend not to get as much attention, especially when the winners can just claim it was a failed rebellion. Trust me kid, I’ve been around long enough to know how much the Kingdom has had to stamp down on to keep its appearance of the Holy Nation,” Jeralt explained, letting out a sigh as he did, “I was never the patriotic type, but I did what I thought was right. Regardless of how I might feel about it, Faerghus was my homeland, so to see how much it's changed…it makes me wonder how things might have turned out if it went just slightly differently.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I must admit, General Jeralt, I didn't know you were burdened with something like this.” Ferdinand said, frowning for a moment as he seemed to go deep into thought. “...May I ask why you told me this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To get it off my chest? Or maybe I'm just trying to show you the respect you deserve for what you're going through.” He shrugged. “I was where you were at one point, fighting people I used to know and care about. It’s not the last time it happened either, but there’s not much you can do about those feelings besides just keep going. A wound will eventually heal into a scar, and even if it aches every so often, those scars will fade in time too. As long as you’re alive, you can keep going.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Goddess, I really am getting old,” Jeralt grumbled after a moment, scratching at his head, “I’m usually a few drinks in before I get this preachy or morbid. Alright Ferdinand, we should check in on–...oh no.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt had seen that look in Ferdinand’s eyes before. That same starry, awestruck gaze Alois and Leonie would give him. “...damn it, I did it again…ah, hey, kid–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, yes General Jeralt? Oh, my apologies, you were saying something about–Oh, checking in on the troops, of course, I should have realized sooner! Yes, let’s check in on everyone and make sure we’re all ready for battle!” And then he was off, heading down the ladder before Jeralt could say anything else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...I should stop giving speeches.”</span>

  <p>
  <span>Ludwig von Aegir was not a good man. To be specific, he wasn’t the type of man who would content himself with being called “good”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To a man like Ludwig, being “good” was the same as being mediocre. It was the same as being known as “nice”; a middling description that said nothing about the person in question beyond their ability to adhere to basic courtesies. So no, Ludwig von Aegir was not a good man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Good men were not great men. And Ludwig von Aegir wanted to be a great man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wanted to be the type of man stories were told of. He wanted to be the type of man people praised as a leader, a visionary, a </span>
  <em>
    <span>hero</span>
  </em>
  <span>; when he had been younger, he dreamed of glory like other young men dreamed of wealth or women. He craved recognition and lusted for power with the deep-seated hunger that made men into emperors.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And yet, reality disappointed him. For though he desired glory, his youth was bereft of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The position of Prime Minister was guaranteed to him by birthright. His talents only ever matched what was expected of him. There were no great wars to win glory in, and those conflicts that did occur were handled by others.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bergliez fought the Empire’s wars. Hevring wrote the Empire’s laws. Gerth pacified the Empire’s neighbors. Even Varley, the wretch, commanded the Empire’s faith.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig von Aegir looked at the world he grew up in and found himself faced with an uncomfortable truth: He was not an exceptional man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And he found, in that truth, a deep, vicious hatred.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wounded pride had a way of festering, and Ludwig von Aegir came to the simplest conclusion that a man in his position could come to: If the world would not give him what he wanted, he would take it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a reasonable choice. It was Ionius’s fault, really. Centralizing power under the emperor was a stupid provocation, and all for what? One wife among many that had been chased away by her betters?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hrym had been a necessary sacrifice, just like the Imperial children.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig von Aegir knew he would never be the Emperor. That destiny wasn’t meant for him. But his son…his boy, his pride and joy, Ferdinand von Aegir…he </span>
  <em>
    <span>would.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Edelgard had been perfect. The same age, born with a crest of Seiros, and already favored by the Emperor…Ludwig knew there were other factors at play, but he always believed that it was his choice that made Edelgard into the perfect emperor that she would become.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He could content himself with being the power behind the throne. Edelgard would conquer all of Fodlan with Ferdinand at her side and he, Ludwig von Aegir, would be known as the man that made it all happen. The savior of Adrestia.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So what went wrong? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first thought that came to mind was the death of that idiot Arundel or Thales or whatever his name had actually been. A chance rockslide that killed the man who had supported Ludwig’s ambitions had seemed like a boon in disguise at first. The Agarthans had pulled back, startled by their master’s demise, and Ludwig did the natural thing of taking advantage of that weakness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was smart to do. It left him in full control of Enbarr without any interference from those bird-masked buffoons that scurried in the shadows and he had enjoyed that freedom quite readily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But then Edelgard turned on him, and Ludwig still didn’t understand why. Didn’t she comprehend the sacrifices he made for her sake? He would have made her a perfect emperor, ruling a united Fodlan with the church reduced to an impotent wreckage incapable of wielding any influence against her. And yet, even with the church destroyed, that dream was so far out of reach, he could nearly weep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To think the Kingdom would have the audacity to attack first. To think they would even prove to be a threat! Yet that foolish girl focused her efforts on rooting out her greatest supporter instead of slaughtering the northern traitors that would dare to threaten the greatest empire that the world had ever known!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig would have gone to her side in an instant if Edelgard could simply put aside her foolish pride and understand that </span>
  <em>
    <span>she needed him!</span>
  </em>
  <span> That the Empire needed his guidance, his wisdom, his ambition!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But no. And now the crimson banners of Adrestia were streaming through his open gates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was sabotage, my lord!” declared one of his commanders, his voice frantic beneath the savant’s helm he wore. “Infiltrators managed to get into the western gatehouses and open nearly all of them!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My lord, the northern walls have been breached!” another officer called out, “Weaknesses in the structures were taken advantage of and we’re taking heavy losses across that entire flank!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about the seas?” Ludwig asked, his voice strangely calm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Blockaded, my lord! Ships bearing the Adrestian flag have cut us off completely!” answered his admiral, panic obvious on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lady Fenja has gone to reinforce the troops on the western front, my lord, but we may need to consider our options–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh? What options are those?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The officers in the war room stiffened, before turning their gazes to the young man sitting atop a nearby table, his legs crossed beneath him. His tone had been curious, but these officers of Hrym, veteran commanders with plenty of experience with their supposed “allies”, were rightfully wary of saying anything that might provoke the Agarthan in their midst.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig, meanwhile, just glowered at the annoying brat. “Presumably, my commander is suggesting we surrender, retreat, or reinforce our barricades to prepare for a final stand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, huh.” Shax tilted his head. “Well you’re not doing the first one. Papa Myson made it pretty clear to me that I’m supposed to kill anybody on our side that tries to surrender since he doesn’t trust any of you to keep quiet about all the plans Hrym has going on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig could practically see the morale in the war room drop at those words. “Hmph. I suppose it is good to know where I stand with that dastard…though your father has nothing to fear from my soldiers. Execution is all that awaits us if we surrender at this point. Even if Edelgard wasn’t being unreasonable, we’ve reached the point of no return now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He let a humorless smile spread across his face just as he spread his arms outward. “I am the Empire’s greatest traitor, next to that wretched barbarian Loog. Leaving me alive in the event of her victory is unconscionable.” His lips turned downward. “In fact, the very idea is offensive to the dignity of Adrestia.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh.” Shax stared at him, assessing the older man. “That’s…an interesting way to think of things. Hm…well, anyways, I guess you could run away if you really, really wanted, but I have orders to bring you directly to Papa Myson if that happens–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That won’t be necessary.” If surrendering into Edelgard’s custody offended Ludwig, the very concept of leaving himself to Myson’s “mercy” horrified him. “No, today is the last stand of Ludwig von Aegir. Today…I will have victory or I will have death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His commanders shared a look, before one in heavy armor nodded his head to his liege. “We will follow at your command, my lord.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their loyalty nearly made him smile. This was how it should be. Prompt obedience, loyalty unto death…if only the rest of this forsaken world could understand the concept. “Prepare for battle. We’ll sortie from the castle and strike with everything we have.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“At once, my lord!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As his remaining commanders readied themselves for what could easily be their final battle, Ludwig found his eyes returning to Shax, who seemed, at most, mildly curious at the activity in the war room. “Boy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” His eyes flicked toward Ludwig, shifting from green to red and then back again. “What’s up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re younger than my son, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have a son?” Shax paused. “Did I know that? I think I knew that…oh, right, the one with the lance. Wow, he has a lot more hair than you do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A light glinted off of Ludwig’s bald dome as he glowered. “You should learn to respect your betters–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he flinched when Shax’s expression went completely cold. “I do. You’re not better than me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...bah, I don’t know why I ever bothered!” Ludwig snarled, “You’re just like that arrogant father of yours!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am?” Shax suddenly smiled. “Heh, that’s nice of you to say! No one’s ever compared us before!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...” So it seemed an easy way to earn the eerie boy’s approval was to compare him to his dastard of a father. Well, Ludwig supposed that made sense. Any son would enjoy being compared favorably to his father. Ferdinand had, once. “...hm. You want to make him proud, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh…yeah. I do.” Shax nodded, seeming confused by the shift in topic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good. That’s natural. A young man should strive to make his family proud. As long as you work towards that goal, you’ll live a life you can be satisfied with.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...huh. Isn’t your son fighting against us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He is. That son of mine…he’s too softhearted for his own good. He should have known better than to follow that girl’s orders. He was meant to be an emperor himself, but now…” Ludwig sighed, then shook his head. “It doesn’t matter. At least I know House Aegir will still be secure in the future with him as its head.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax stared at him with a small frown. “It sounds like you’re expecting him to win.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bah, I’m no fatalist. I am a realist! Your father doesn’t intend for me to survive this battle, boy, and I know this day will likely be my last. I’m not happy with the idea and I certainly do not intend to go quietly on my way to the goddess!” He clenched his fists, then released the tension in his body with a sigh. “But if today is going to be my end…then I would like to make one request, Shax.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...what is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do not harm Ferdinand. If I lose this battle, allow him to be the one to end my life.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...why would you want that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ludwig scoffed. “Isn’t it natural for a father to choose his own death over his child’s? If Myson is half the man he should be, he would agree with me.” He turned away then, grabbing his axe and shield from where they were waiting. “Now then, that’s enough life lessons. I thank you for allowing me to impart some wisdom before I meet my fate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome, I guess,” Shax replied, still frowning faintly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was strange. The things Ludwig said made sense to the young man, his mind going over each word as he followed the corpulent noble out of the war room and towards the sounds of battle. But at the same time, they didn’t quite sound right.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After all, Myson would never throw his life away for Shax. He was too valuable for something so pointless. But…the idea of an adult sacrificing themselves for someone younger still made sense. That was what Lady Bias had done.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So…what kind of man did that make Myson?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a curious thought that percolated in the young Agarthan’s head as he followed Archduke Aegir out to war. Sure, there was more shouting orders and armoring up and something about trying to use commoners as human shields, which frankly sounded impractical since you couldn’t really tie a person to a shield and use it effectively since they’d be too heavy, but the main objective at the moment was hanging back and watching Ludwig raise his axe in front of a crowd of armored knights.</span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>“FOR THE TRUE EMPIRE!” Ludwig declared, proud and bald, the sunlight gleaming off of his fancy axe, before he took one step and his chest erupted in a spray of blood.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...huh.” Shax blinked, staring at the duke’s bleeding body as it walked a few more steps before toppling over, his feet apparently failing to realize the rest of the body was mortally wounded. “...wait, shit–”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“LORD LUDWI–Gerk–!” one of the generals started to shout right before a pointed tail went straight through his throat. Two more tails stabbed outwards, extending from a very pretty orange-haired lady that had just killed three heavily armored knights in less than a second and was currently stabbing a very sharp dagger into the kidneys of a fourth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then Shax noticed the likely reason why the guy he was supposed to protect just started bleeding everywhere, the purplish flash of shadow giving him a quick heads up to bring his sword up to block a blade going for his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey prick, heard you tried to kill my sister again,” Shez greeted, glaring into her clone’s eyes as her twin blades locked against Shax’s greatsword, “You mind staying still so I can cut your balls off?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh…no, I don’t think I’m going to do that,” Shax replied, before pausing when he noticed the tailed lady shiver.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gods, you have never sounded sexier than you do right now,” the redhead said, grinning at Shez as she pushed a knight’s helmet up and shoved her tails through his chin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not right now, Kronya! Flirt after!” Shez ordered, before she vanished in a flash of violet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax promptly ducked, eyes scanning for where the attack would come from, then warped away before a sword could skewer his head from above. “Gh–How do you do that?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What, you can’t warp above people?” Shez asked, smirking, “Then why the hell would I help you out by explaining how it works?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can figure it out myself then!” Shax snapped, his thoughts racing. Ludwig was dead already, beasts couldn’t survive losing all their blood, but what did that mean for Shax? Should he flee the fight or try to kill some of the enemy in return?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Weakling,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the old man’s voice rumbled in his head, louder and clearer than it normally was, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Too frail to fight, too feeble to kill…run away, coward. Lest you die and waste my blood in your veins.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut it!” he snapped, smacking his fist against his head to shut up the ancient failure. He glared at Shez, who had paused in confusion at his sudden outburst. “You…You and your damn sister, you just keep ruining everything!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, and? You assholes started this,” Shez countered, “Your boss started this war in the first place, </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> boss killed Edelgard’s family and tortured her, and don’t think I forgot about you killing Victor! So don’t give me any of that whiny crap about us making things suck for you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gh–But you just killed Ludwig! That makes things even!” he whined, “It’s fine if I killed your bald guy because you just killed mine!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s not how anything works! And, wait, what do you mean I killed Ludwig?” Shez asked, her anger faltering, “Like…Ludwig von Aegir? Ferdinand’s dad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! You cut his chest open!” Shax pointed out, literally pointing with his sword to the bloodied body of Hrym’s so-called “Archduke”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...ohhh nooo, oh shit. Ohhhhh, shit.” Shez winced, looking from the bleeding baldy back to Shax. “That’s him? Really? I thought that was just a commander–A-And besides, he doesn’t look anything like Ferdinand!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He said his kid’s name was Ferdinand, that means logically he’s your Ferdinand’s dad,” Shax retorted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aw shit, that’s…maybe if I blame it on Shax…?” Shez muttered to herself, making her clone stiffen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What!? No! Don’t you dare blame your screw-up on me! I was keeping watch on Ludwig, you were the one that killed him!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s the problem?” Kronya spoke up, pulling her tail free of another impaled knight while she casually cut the throat of a mage struggling in her grasp, “We were trying to kill that guy in the first place, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shez winced. “Well, yeah, but…you know! He was Ferdinand’s dad! I’m pretty sure he had this whole thing about having to fight him and I just ruined that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...so, wait, it’s a bad thing that you killed Ferdinand’s father for him? Did he want to kill his dad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–Maybe? I mean…I think it was kind of a noble honor thing?” Shez shrugged, still looking sheepish, “Do you think he’ll be mad?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does it matter? Just lie and say he was killed by that one,” Kronya suggested, pointing at Shax, who let out an offended gasp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Seriously?! Both of you are the worst! You–you liars! Traitors! Beast-lovers!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…” Shez just stared at her clone with a blank expression, then nodded to herself. “Alright, yeah, let’s just beat up Shax and blame the death of Ferd’s dad on him. Good plan, Kronya.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, beloved~!” Kronya crooned as Shax grimaced, readying his blade.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His eyes quickly scanned the field, his thoughts racing as he tried to figure out a way out of this. It wasn’t like the Hrymians could help, most of them were dead already, and Ludwig was too busy bleeding on the ground to help, a trail of blood following the archduke as he crawled–</span>
  <em>
    <span>Wait, hang on, what?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax stared at the still-alive noble, then promptly flashed over to him and hoisted him up, fully ignoring Shez’s surprised yell as he warped away with Ludwig.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gh–B-Be more c-careful, boy,” the archduke grunted, his face pale as the two stumbled onto the wall surrounding the palace. “Y-You had better not kill me with a poor landing!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why does everyone keep saying I’m the one that’s gonna kill you?” Shax asked, genuinely getting frustrated, “My whole job is to protect you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmph…y-you're doing a poor job of it then…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax winced, the old man’s voice echoing </span>
  <em>
    <span>failure </span>
  </em>
  <span>in his head. “I know that! But, look, I can get you to Papa Myson, I–“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No!” Ludwig grabbed his arm, clutching tight to him, “N-Not him! Not that…that butcher!” His eyes were wide, frantic, before they steeled into something more solid. “Not him…don’t take me to him. Take me to my boy. To Ferdinand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…you still want him to kill you?” Shax asked, his brow furrowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want…I-I want to see him…i-if you can give me anything, give me that.” The bleeding hadn’t stopped. It was strange that a man like Ludwig could still be alive after such a grievous wound.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax stared at him, then looked out over the city. Wyverns and pegasi clashed in the sky above while fire and thunder roared down below. Less buildings were on fire then he would have expected, but that made a weird sort of sense. The Imperials would want the city intact after purging it of all traitors.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, the chaos of battle made it difficult to tell where anyone important was hanging out. Shax narrowed his eyes, looking for anyone that seemed significant among the rabble, before he spotted a hint of orange in the distance and grinned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There we go. C’mon Ludwig, let’s go get you killed by your son!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Th-That’s not–“ Ludwig tried to protest, though Shax ignored him completely in favor of grabbing the bald archduke and warping into the thick of the fighting.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Jeralt Eisner had seen a lot of war. It was only natural when someone lived as long as him. People had a tendency to pick fights, and the powerful would either gain the loyalty of those willing to fight for them, or they’d just hire somebody to fight in their stead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So yeah, Jeralt knew a lot about war; in particular, he was well aware of the fact that besieging a city was always a pain in the ass. The gates had to be broken or opened, the walls had to be scaled, and once a soldier was inside, he had to fight through unfamiliar streets teeming with people that wanted him dead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If Jeralt had his way, he wouldn’t even come close to cities. Living in the countryside was feeling more appealing day by day.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The worst part was, somehow he got put in charge of the most rambunctious brats on the field.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“COME ON, IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?!” Caspar shouted, blood drenching those fancy sacred gauntlets of his as he smashed his way through the enemy forces. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Apparently there was a story behind why Caspar had the sacred weapon of his house now, one involving having to beat his one-legged dad in a fight that still left craters in the landscape outside Fort Merceus. Jeralt didn’t feel like asking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead, he stayed back and kept a close eye on the reckless kid as broken bodies went flying in his wake. Though, calling the kid reckless wasn’t quite right. He was brash and liked to charge in, sure, but Caspar at least knew how to keep his friends close. Having the crown princess of Brigid as his partner in bloodshed seemed to cover for the kid’s weaknesses; whenever someone tried to strike from Caspar blindspots, there Petra was, cutting through throats and stabbing into the gaps of armor before moving straight along to the next target. And where she couldn’t be, the pair of mages added to their shared battalions picked up the slack.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a kid with a fear of blood, Linhardt was handling himself pretty well out here, healing and warping people as needed in between throwing out his own bits of wind and fire. He clearly preferred playing support, but Jeralt’s kid had trained him, and that meant the lazy brat did know how to handle himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As for Lysithea, Jeralt was convinced he could have thrown her out into the city on her own and she would have taken it in a couple hours. Sure, the city wouldn’t be intact after that, but he was still sure she could do that damage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So yeah, Jeralt’s side of the battlefield was being handled decently enough. He would have said it was a clean sweep, if it weren’t for the sudden flash of purple light that deposited a heavily bleeding bald man at his horse’s hooves.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There, I got–Wait, no–“ The kid staring up at him, mouth open in obvious shock, looked like Shez. Too much like Shez. He could have been her twin for how similar they looked. “Shit. Shit!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He even had that same look she’d get when she thought she screwed something up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No no no, where is he?!” the kid demanded, looking around the bloodied street as the battle moved away from them, Casper’s battalion leading the charge despite the fact they were infantry and not cavalry. “He should be here! Where is Ferdinand?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wrong side of the city, kid,” Jeralt stated as he hopped down from Argo, the old warhorse entirely unfazed by the bleeding body at his feet, “Last report I got, he was fighting that Fenja woman in some dramatic duel to the death.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?! But that’s–No, he’s supposed to be over here so he can fight his dad in a dramatic duel to the death!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt raised an eyebrow, then looked down at the bleeding man. “This is Ludwig von Aegir?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, he is!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The enemy commander?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? No, he’s not the enemy, he’s–” Shax paused. Then he took the time to actually look at Jeralt. “Uh…that depends. Which side are you on?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Emperor’s. I’m Jeralt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...oh. Ohhhhhh nooooo…” The kid winced. “Uh…can I have him back?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But he’ll die!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gotta be honest, I’m surprised you care, kid,” Jeralt said as he crouched down beside Hrym’s so-called Archduke. The arrogant prick actually had the balls to glare at him. Still, Jeralt could see the value in taking him alive, so he popped the cork on a potion and forced it into Aegir’s mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wh–H-Hey! What are you doing!?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Healing him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You look like you’re drowning him!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can do both,” Jeralt stated, making sure the prick downed every last drop. The flow of blood stopped, his wounds sealing up as the concoction worked its magic. Ludwig’s breathing evened out, his face slowly regaining some color, so Jeralt grabbed his head and casually slammed it against the cobblestone, knocking the man out cold.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah–That wasn’t healing!” Shax complained, prompting Jeralt to turn his unimpressed gaze towards him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kid, you just handed me the enemy commander. Until I can secure him properly, it’s better for him to stay unconscious.” He stood back up, brushing off his pants. “So, is this your way of asking to defect?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? No, of course not! I’m not a traitor! I just–He was dying and he asked me to bring him to his son, so I did that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then I guess it’s too much to hope that you’re willing to surrender.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The kid’s eyes narrowed in a glare. His irises were red instead of Shez’s purple, so that was one difference. Though Shez’s eyes did tend to have that orange glow these days, so it might be something similar. “I’m not surrendering either. Now give back Ludwig, or…why am I even talking to you? I should kill you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d prefer it if you didn’t. I might be older than I have any right to be, but I still want to live long enough to see my kids get married.” Jeralt shrugged, making no move to unstrap the lance from his back. “I don’t really want to fight you either. You look like my kid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…what? That’s…that’s all it takes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt nodded. “The way I see it, you’ve got four options here, kid. You can try to go for me, and probably catch the attention of everyone on my side doing so. I’m sure you can handle yourself, but I’m also sure the white-haired girl over there can kill a grown man with a flick of her wrist, so you ought to think about the risk here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax frowned, then glanced over towards the battling battalions, only to flinch. “Gh…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, that’s a fair reaction.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not reacting to her, I…the other one, with the purple, uh, wait, magenta? The reddish-purple hair and tan skin, she cut my throat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Petra. Yeah, she does that. Which brings me to your other options. Surrender, defect, or retreat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax snapped his gaze towards Jeralt, scowling. “I told you, I’m not a traitor! Why do you keep saying I should defect?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Honestly? You look like my kid.” Jeralt shrugged. “Practically, if you’re even half as good as Shez, you’d be good to have on our side. The kids might complain, and I doubt Vestra will be happy until he has something on you to keep you from turning coat again, but it would still be a decent win for us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…you’re crazy. Shouldn’t you hate me too for killing that Victor guy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kid, Victor was a mercenary. He knew the score. He’d probably curse me if I didn’t take the opportunity to try recruiting you. But if you really don’t want that, I can accept your surrender. Edelgard is fine with taking prisoners. Even Agarthans.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That…That’s stupid. I’m not–No Agarthan would surrender,” Shax retorted, his voice wavering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Some have. They’re being treated fine. You could meet them, if you want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shax stared at him, then shook his head. “N-No. No, I can’t–You’re lying. Agarthans–It is our duty, our–It’s impossible for us to…to…” He screwed his eyes shut, then punched the side of his head. “Shut up! Let me think!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jeralt frowned, but stayed quiet, watching the kid mutter to himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...n-no. No. I can’t.” The kid looked up at him, those red eyes wavering. “I have to…I have to fight. For Lady Bias and Papa Myson.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, if that’s your choice.” Jeralt still didn’t move to grab his weapon. “But it doesn’t have to be today, kid. Do us both a favor and go home.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…” The kid stared at him. He glanced to the side, taking note of how far ahead the Bergliez battalion was, then sized up Jeralt, obviously thinking about if he could take him in a fight. His eyes narrowed and Jeralt tensed at the bloodlust in the kid’s eyes…then Shax slumped, the fight going out of him. “What would be the point? I still can’t win…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…hey, kid–“ Jeralt began to reach out, but Shax vanished, warping away in a familiar flash of purple shadows. “…hm. Not feeling great about how that went.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Argo whinnied, drawing his attention back to the old warhorse. Jeralt’s steed tapped his hoof on Aegir, earning a pained groan from the unconscious traitor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure Ferdinand would prefer it if we bring his dad back alive, Argo,” Jeralt pointed out, “So don't crush him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Argo chuffed, displeased, but settled down so Jeralt could hoist the unconscious archduke on his horse’s back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I really am getting too old for this,” Jeralt muttered as he secured Aegir in place, “If that kid had gone for me…I don’t think I could’ve fought back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Argo made another displeased noise, trying to move closer to Jeralt. Either to comfort him, or to complain about the extra weight on his back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…I have a feeling this is going to be my last war, Argo. One way or another.”</span>
