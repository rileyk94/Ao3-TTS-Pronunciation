			<h2>Prologue</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert</p><p>Author's Notes: If you're reading this, you should read 'Only a Moron' by swabloo, and 'A Cage of Blood and Circumstance' by shadowsdeep instead. They're much better fics than this.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Prologue</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> There is no death, only a change of worlds ~ Native American Proverb</em></p><p><em> .</p><p></em></p><p><hr /></p><p>My name is Shikako Nara, and I am going to tell you a story.</p><p>You see, my name wasn't always Shikako. It was… well, that hardly matters now. If you asked anyone around me, they would tell you that I have always been 'Shikako'. They could take you to my twin brother, or my parents, and they would tell you 'yes, that's Shikako. She was born in Konoha Hospital on the 22nd of September. I should know, I was there'.</p><p>And its true. I was born Shikako Nara, daughter to Shikaku and Yoshino Nara, younger sister to Shikamaru Nara by thirty minutes.</p><p>But I was someone else before that.</p><p>Tentatively, I'll say I was reincarnated. Even now, I'm not sure I believe it. Maybe this is just some illusion that my mind has cooked up - either before or after. I don't know. What I do know, is that it <em> feels</em> real. So I decided to live as though it was. If it's fake, then I have lost nothing.</p><p>See, the reason that it was so hard to believe, is that this world, the one I've been reborn into? I've heard of it before. Or more precisely, I've read it in a manga and I've watched it on TV.</p><p>This is the Naruto-universe.</p><p>Yeah. Imagine <em> my </em> surprise when I worked <em> that </em> one out.</p><p>As far as reincarnations go, well, I can't tell you if it's a step up or a step down. I had always been <em> safe</em> before, born into a safe family, in a safe town, in a safe country. Now, here was a world where things were rough and wild and even civilized people hired assassins. Was this a step down the karmic ladder? Had I been a bad person? On the other hand, for all that this world was terrifying, I had narrowly missed a worse fate - I had been born to Konoha, arguably the nicest shinobi village, to a good family.</p><p>I mean, in the stories, bad people are always reincarnated as ants and then stepped on, right?</p><p>I don't know. I also don't know why I <em> remembered</em> . I was an average person. I had siblings and parents, but no partner or children. I had a basic university degree and an average job. I left no outstanding legacies and committed no unutterable crimes. When I died, I doubt very many people noticed at all. I'm not the kind of person you want to rely on to save the world. Maybe some god up there has a weird sense of humour. Maybe it was just an accident. I slipped through the cogs of cosmic reckoning and wasn't important enough to be noticed.</p><p>I like that explanation best.</p><p>But like I said before, I was born to Shikaku and Yoshino Nara in the Konoha General Hospital on the 22nd of September as the younger of twins. It sounds so amazing when said like that. A spiritual miracle. The truth was, at the time I had no idea what was happening. I was twisted and squeezed and the comforting darkness in which I had rested was torn away. There was pain and cold and terror. There was immediacy. Things that hadn't seemed important were suddenly at the forefront of my mind; what had happened; where was I; was I alive or dead, hurt or injured; what was going on?</p><p>I couldn't tell.</p><p>When babies are born, their eyes are incredibly undeveloped. The entire world was a blur to me. It wasn't quite colour blindness, but the easiest thing to see was the stark contrast between light and dark. I could see shapes and edges but the world looked incredibly confusing.</p><p>I was scared. Terrified. I didn't know what was happening. I could hear, yes, but not understand what was being said. Had I suffered brain damage? Did I have aphasia? The thought terrified me. I can think few worse fates that to be trapped with no method of communication to the world around me.</p><p>But even that didn't explain everything. I was lifted and carried. I've always been on the short and thin side, but even that didn't explain the ease with which I was lifted or how I was being carried. I suppose I must have been held in the crook of someone's arm, but I could make no sense of the sensations at the time. It didn't fit.</p><p>I did the only thing I could have. I screamed. I wailed. I cried.</p><p>It sounds odd that I, as an adult in mind, should respond that way. But I was, in part, at least, ruled by the instincts of the new body I inhabited. Even had I attempted to speak, my vocal apparatus wasn't coordinated enough to allow it, not to mention the language barrier that was in place. So crying, the ultimate response to any kind of discomfort, it was.</p><p>It's hard to convey just how <em> frightening</em> it was, to be helpless like that.</p><p>I will admit to being a horrible baby. I was near blind, confused and helpless. My body didn't respond to me. And there was an unbearable itch inside me of forming chakra coils.</p><p>In response, I cried. All. The. Time.</p><p>I feel bad about it now. It must have been an incredibly trying time for my new parents. (I felt uncomfortable calling them 'mum' and 'dad' at first. They weren't <em> my</em> parents, the ones I remembered. On the other hand, I didn't know their names to start with, and I lacked the understanding of the language to pick them out. It left me in a quandary. Of course, that didn't last for that long. It was lonely, being a child. They were the only people I interacted with. They fed me, changed me, determined my schedule. It's impossible to rely on someone like that and not come to love them.) They were, as most ninja parents are, fairly young when we were born. The war had only recently ended and they were probably still trying to adapt to the strange creature known as 'peace-time'.</p><p>They tried everything they could. And when that failed, they took me back to the hospital, afraid that something was wrong.</p><p>Although I didn't learn it until much later, the medic diagnosed me as 'chakra hypersensitive'. Literally, that my pain was caused by my own chakra system. It was a deathblow to a ninja career. Ninjutsu, genjutsu, anything that required chakra, would simply be too painful to attempt. Even Lee, with his deformed coils, had managed to use chakra to enhance his body. What they didn't understand was that it was neither my body nor my chakra that was causing the issue, but my mind. Chakra was a limb I had never used, a sense I had never had, it was foreign and I didn't understand it. With knowledge and time, I would grow to be as comfortable with it as any other, if unusually aware of it, but at that point, I was not.</p><p>At that point in time, I didn't even know what it <em> was</em> .</p><p>All I could tell was that there was something <em> inside</em> me that had never been there before. It wasn't just my own chakra, though, there was chakra in everything, including the very air I breathed. Sometimes, when I woke up from deep sleep, I would be convinced that I was going to drown on it. I would cough and choke and hack and flail about in panic until it set in that <em> it was just air</em> .</p><p>Of course, just when I was beginning to settle in, That Event happened. I was three weeks old when the Kyuubi attack happened. Of course, I had no idea what was going on at that stage. I barely knew I was a child.</p><p>But I remember the chakra.</p><p>Evil isn't a word that I want to throw around lightly. But it was overwhelming, it was terrifying, it was malicious, and it was demonic. It was in the air like thick smoke and every breath I took made me choke on it. I was too terrified to scream.</p><p>It was nameless and faceless to me, and that only made it worse. I couldn't quantify it or analyse it or understand it. It was an all pervasive horror that I could neither resist or fight. It was like the devil had opened the gates of hell and breathed terror into the air. It was crippling.</p><p>I thought it would drive me mad.</p><p>For once, Shikamaru was screaming and I was quiet. There was no way I could make a sound. I was beyond that.</p><p>That feeling of being helpless in the face of overwhelming terror stayed with me for a long time. It was something that has both terrified me and motivated me ever since.</p><p>I am not ashamed to say I have had more nightmares about that day than I care to count.</p><p>But that was a single event of terror. Most of my days were filled with mind numbing boredom and a complete lack of control, over myself and over the environment around me.</p><p>Most of my time as a baby was spent sleeping, and playing with my chakra, not that I knew what it was at that stage. But I desperately needed something to occupy my attention while I couldn't interact with the world around me. At first I was cautious with it, but when there seemed to be no effect to my manipulations, I grew bolder. Likely, it was enhancing my muscles even then, but since I wasn't mobile, there was no discernable difference. I did, however, get a good 'feel' for my chakra, and probably developed very good control over it. Mostly though, I thought of it was something to occupy my adult brain, that was incredibly starved for stimulation.</p><p>There's not really a way to describe how chakra feels. Its like having a second set of veins solely to transport hot chocolate around your body, warm and comforting. Or maybe coffee, awakening and revitalising everything it touched.</p><p>Manipulating it wasn't difficult. It wasn't like trying to tame a foreign entity, or herd cats, or direct water from a hose. It was a swirl of warm energy, not just <em> directed</em> by my mind, but part of it. It's so impossible to describe.</p><p>My sight didn't fully develop until about six months of age and that was when I started to realise exactly where I was. That was also around the time when my vocal cords were formed enough to begin speaking. I picked up on the spoken language easily, as children are wont to do. I didn't even have an accent, of which I was thankful, since that would have been difficult to explain.</p><p>It was frustrating, though, trying to learn a new language like that. No wonder toddlers are famous for their temper tantrums.</p><p>By the time I was a year old, the evidence for where I was was mounting. Dad's standard attire was the shinobi flack jacket, and I had seen his headband.

			<h2>Academy Arc: Chapter 1</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Fear is the mother of foresight ~ Thomas Hardy</em></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p><em> .</em></p><p>I didn't exactly jump for joy when I worked out where I was. Given that my twin brother was <em> Shikamaru</em> I could guess pretty well what kind of time zone I was in. That didn't mean, however that the world around me was 'canon' Naruto-verse. Obviously, I was here and that was a factor that hadn't been present in the show. Many, many other things could be different.</p><p>But even if it was 'canon', Konoha had been invaded, what, twice? over the course of the show. There was the up coming war. And not to mention, on a day to day basis over half the town were highly trained, slightly unstable, killers.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this place as a vacation, that's for sure.</p><p>This was a world where only the strong and lucky survived. The weak? Well, they choked to death on their own screams when the devil came to town.</p><p>I did not, <em> ever</em> , want to be so helpless again.</p><p>Like I said, the Kyuubi attack has motivated me ever since.</p><p>There was never pressure on me to be a ninja, in fact, I doubt very much that my parents even thought I would be with my 'handicap'. I could have stayed to look after the deer, I could have studied medicine, and that idea had appealed to me.</p><p>The life of a ninja was rough and dangerous. But I had played it safe before to no avail. And there was no guarantee that 'playing it safe' would save me. Civilians died far easier than shinobi, after all.</p><p>Of course, as a toddler there wasn't much I could do. I soaked up the information that was offered to me, speaking, walking, games. I don't know what I would have done during those days without Shikamaru. He was my lifeline, my measuring stick. What rate of progress should I show, could I show? What things should I be learning?</p><p>I have no doubt that I came off as an odd, deliberate child. I have the feeling that had I been born to any family other than the Nara, things would have been much trickier for me. They seemed completely unperturbed when I picked things up much faster than Shikamaru - my adult mind capable of grasping concepts easier, having much more experience learning. Given that the clan is as famed for their intelligence as their shadow jutsu, maybe it wasn't so uncommon. I tried to hold myself back, I truly did, but it was incredibly frustrating and I was desperately bored.</p><p>Of course, now that I knew that the energy I felt was chakra, I remembered some things about how it was used. The idea of being able to walk up and down walls was just so <em> cool</em> that I had to try learn how. Almost as soon as I started to crawl, I began to try and channel chakra to help me stick to things. Of course, I learnt quickly just how much chakra it actually took. It shouldn't have surprised me, given that I was expelling chakra through both hands and knees. The surface area of one palm alone is quite large, and to maintain a constant rate of chakra emission used up my small supply quite rapidly. There was a reason the serious ninjutsu training didn't start before eight or nine. That was when chakra reserves began expanding beyond the 'essential' chakra that fueled the body.</p><p>I spent many days napping in the sunshine after exhausting myself, learning slowly where the line for chakra exhaustion was. It wasn't, by any means, a bad way of spending my days. I most certainly didn't attempt to climb vertically. Not only would that be suspicious, I would get maybe three or four steps up before falling. That wasn't something I really looked forward to.</p><p>There were other chakra exercises that didn't take so much chakra. <em> Anything</em> that used chakra was technically a control exercise, and anything that was taught as a control exercise usually had other applications. Less draining than wall walking was the leaf sticking exercise - which didn't necessarily need leaves. The two exercises were opposite sides of the same coin, sticking yourself to something and sticking something to yourself. I used paper, blankets, my clothes, anything in reach. There were tiny, minute differences between the different materials and different fabrics, that required slight adjustments in the amount of chakra needed and the rate it was expelled. Once you had something stuck to you and covered in chakra, you could manipulate it slightly. There were stories of medic nin with control so precise they could fold an origami crane out of rice paper without touching it. There were chakra strings to develop control over chakra outside the body. Chakra strings were tricky in concept, but there wasn't really much difference between creating one and twenty, except in moving them after. Puppet users were masters of multitasking, apparently. Given that dozens of strings could be attached to each puppet it was no wonder that Sasori's Performance of One Hundred Puppets was legendary. I couldn't even <em> attach</em> two strings to different objects without getting confused, let alone start moving them.</p><p>By the time I was two, and both Shikamaru and I were capable of talking in complete, if basic, sentences - though Shikamaru spoke rarely - I would toddle around the house with one of my story books, incessantly pestering anyone in the house to read it to me. The language was all written in Japanese, and I very, very much wanted to be able to read.</p><p>I had studied Japanese once, years ago, though I will admit to never being very good at it, but it did mean I knew the difference between written Japanese and written English. English has a 26 letter alphabet, each one corresponding to a specific sound. Hiragana is a simple phonetic alphabet where each character represents a combined consonant-vowel combination and are sounded out to make words. Katakana is the same, but used mostly for foreign words. Kanji, though. Kanji. There are thousands of them. The same Kanji can mean different things, be pronounced differently, depending on where and how it is used or what other Kanji it is combined with.</p><p>I spent many hours sitting in my dads lap, finger tracing under the words as he read, trying desperately to associate the symbols with specific sounds. It was about this time that I began to suspect that being reborn had changed me - I doubt very much I would have ever been able to succeed at this before. I had been smart before, yes, but never to this degree. I think that this was another instance of my body affecting my actions - simply, the brain I was using could compute so much faster than the one I used to have.</p><p>It was a little disconcerting. It made sense, yes - the mind wasn't a spiritual entity tenuously tied to the body, it was formed by thousands of interconnecting neurons in the brain, which somehow or other lead to the higher conciousness we call 'the mind'. Realistically, it made perfect sense. That didn't mean it wasn't unnerving.</p><p>In the end, I accepted it as something useful that would help me here.</p><p>Once I could read, it was like the whole world opened up for me.</p><p>My parents must have thought I loved history, with the fevor that I read the books. To be fair, it was fairly interesting, especially given how short it was. History in my world could be measured back tens of thousands of years, not even considering archeology which could trace back several million years. Here, records were sparse before the formation of villages and practically nonexistent before the Sage of the Six Paths.</p><p>But I was researching.</p><p>I wanted to know about this world. I wanted to know if it matched with the show, however ludicrous the idea seemed. I read, struggling through children's books, then ever increasing books of difficulty. I wrote notes. I drew up timelines that were a mess of connections between this event and that. I began to understand.</p><p>(I also took note of any techniques mentioned, either basic or advanced, to look up later. To find out what was possible and what was exaggerated. Sometimes it seemed that <em> everything</em> was possible.)</p><p>History, especially shinobi history, wasn't really something that there many books on. It probably had something to do with the secretive nature of shinobi. Likely there were many classified events that would fill in the holes of my timeline. What I did find out was clearly written with propaganda in mind.</p><p>It took many months, and of course it was interspersed with other activites. I couldn't devote all my time to it, even had I been able to force myself to focus for so long. In that time, I also developed an interest in codes and ciphers. The ones available in the library were so low level that a ninja would laugh at them, but the puzzle to them caught my attention immediately. Also, the thought of being able to write secret notes, but I was far too impatient for that to be a true goal as I knew it would take years to create a code safe enough to trust even the basest of secrets to it. There were fantasy books and adventure books and the series 'Ranko the Rogue Ninja' which was funny, entertaining, informative and just a little disturbing, if you looked closely.</p><p>But it did prove, to me, that this world was as similar to the show as I could manage to remember.</p><p>Which lead to the condrum, what was I going to do now?</p><p>If, as it seemed, this world was the Naruto-verse, then I knew the future, or some of it. Was there <em> anything</em> I could do?</p><p>The answer appeared to be a staggering 'no'.</p><p>Who would believe a warning from a child? I had no method of giving warning in secret, nor would I be confident in my ability to do so. I most definitely didn't want to see what they would do to me if I came out and said I remembered a previous life. A mental institution would be the nicest of several unpleasant outcomes.</p><p>What <em> were </em> the big events? The important ones. The invasion of Konoha. The Akatsuki. Pein's attack. The 4th Shinobi War. Could I stop those? Realistically?</p><p>The 4th Shinobi War was caused by Madara and Kabuto. If they were removed… Maybe, maybe they could be taken out before it got to that stage. The same with Pein.</p><p>Orochimaru's invasion? I had no clue.</p><p>I needed to be strong. It wasn't an <em> impossible</em> goal. After all, at fifteen, Sasuke had killed Deidara and Itachi, Gaara had been strong enough, without the Ichibi, to be General Commander of the Shinobi Army and take out several past Kage. Shikamaru had taken out Hidan. S-rank didn't mean unstoppable. It was possible. But it was going to take a hell of a lot of work to get me there.</p><p>I couldn't do it alone, I knew that without a doubt. But getting the others to trust me, when I couldn't tell them why? That would be tricky.</p><p>But apart from that daunting goal, those first years of my new life were pleasant. The only time I recall the shinobi world intruding on my quiet life was when I was, maybe a year and a half old, maybe two, and Shikaku came back from a mission with two livid scars across the side of his face. He was rather lucky, one arched above his eyebrow, the other curved below his cheekbone; both missed his eye. A missing eye wasn't an <em> insurmountable </em> problem for a skilled ninja, but no one would argue that it <em> was </em> a problem.</p><p>He hadn't been gone for that long, but the scars were mostly healed, just a livid red. Either base healing rates were faster here, or they had been chakra healed. Maybe a mixture of both.</p><p>I think he was a little worried about how we would react to them. Yoshino didn't react to them, other than to maybe hug him a little harder than normal. Maybe she thought 'close call'. We, on the other hand, were too young to really understand and they did make him look rather fierce. And maybe he could be, but I'd never known him as anything other than kind and gentle.</p><p>"Daddy," I burbled, carefully running my pudgy toddler hands over them. Carefully because my motor coordination wasn't that great and I didn't want to poke him in the eye. I don't know what I would have said, but my language facilities weren't very well developed at that stage, anyway. Shikamaru pretty much just yawned and fell asleep, but that's his reaction to anything.</p><p>Shikamaru was a complete sloth, but cuddly in the way all young children are. It was lucky I had no desire to play the run-around games children play, because trying to motivate him into playing would have taken twice as long as the game itself.</p><p>Yoshino, mum, was rather esastic to have a daughter. She seemed to delight in dressing me up and braiding my hair. I didn't mind overmuch, she had good taste and chose mainly darker colours, blues and greens and reds, that complimented my dark hair and fair skin. Of course, I usually stole a pair of Shikamaru's trousers to wear under my dress, at which she would roll her eyes. The fashion of the place was strange to my tastes though I grew used to it. Wearing mesh next to your skin sounds, on the surface, like a painfully bad idea. However, it was surprisingly comfortable. It looked like it was made of thick wire, but in reality it was thin, strong wire wrapped in black fabric. This served two purposes; one to stop the wire shining, and two, so that you <em> didn't</em> get cheese grater skin. Some shirts also came with underlay fabric, either in black or nude.</p><p>I didn't particularly like the three quarter length pants, nor the habit of bandaging them to your ankles, but I had to admit that it was a practical way to keep them from flapping about, even if it did make your thighs look like balloons. I didn't like the open toed ninja sandles, either, but I resolved to grow used to them, because, again, they were practical. They had wide soles and deep grooves to provide plenty of grip on practically any surface, and high tops to brace ankles. The open toes were designed to stop sweating, though they did little to keep your toes warm. I was grateful that Fire Country had mild weather. The fact that they were horrendously ugly simply had to be ignored.</p><p>I missed the elegance of high heels, but seeing as how Konoha hadn't seemed to have heard of concrete paving, it was probably for the best.</p><p>Something I noticed about my parents, even in those early years, was that they were silent when they walked. I mean, they tried to make noise when coming into a room, or walking up behind us, but for them, it was a conscious thing, something they had to pay attention to do. I had no idea how they did it.</p><p>It was half technique, half simply the way they walked. I tried to mimic Yoshino as best I could. Shikaku was simply too good, whatever method he used obscured by his habitual lazy slouch.</p><p>I toddled after Yoshino, stepping as lightly and precisely as I could. Shikaku found the whole thing amusing. "My little cat foot," he would chortle, swinging me up.</p><p>Later on, I'd learn the chakra half of the Cat's Foot technique, but even without it I could move near silently on most surfaces. With it, sometimes I felt more like a ghost than a child.</p><p>We weren't trained at that age, perse, though many of the games we played seemed to have underlying meaning. There were several I was already familiar with, cats cradle and clapping games, but also many more that seemed aimed at developing limber fingers and good hand eye coordination.</p><p>Yoshino also dragged us through a warm up stretching routine in the morning, ever since we were old enough to stand on our own. I likened it to yoga, moving from pose to pose in a natural progression. It was quite astounding just how flexible and supple we were, some of those poses I could have never done in my old body. Then, I hadn't been able to touch my fingertips to the floor without bending my knees; here I could lay my entire palms flat - forwards <em> and</em> backwards. The routine we were taught was one that was clearly meant to be taught to children, as it came with a song to help remember the order of the poses.</p><p>Of course, trying to do all that <em> and</em> sing? It isn't as easy as it sounds. Actually, now that I think about it, the song is a little creepy, too. I guess that's what you get in a ninja society.</p><p>It wasn't all solitude, though. Parents here thought nothing of letting their kids run through the streets. The towering, ramshackle buildings and narrow alleyways made for the perfect setting for games of chase and hide and seek, or as they were called locally - games of 'ninja'. I can't say I particularly enjoyed those times; my 'peers' found me quite strange. It was something I could decrease overtime but the sheer deliberateness of having to <em> relearn</em> how to interact with others instead of simply knowing how to be sociable set me apart. You could argue that I should have been better at it, having a lifetime of experience, but I had never been particularly social and I was far out of my comfort zone. All the rules I had learnt collapsed around me like a house of cards. Kids don't talk about the weather or care about the rising price of X. There was no TV, no shows, no music. Konoha didn't have a national sport that everyone followed. We didn't yet attend school, so I didn't even have that to talk about. Most of them couldn't yet read. I was completely lost.</p><p>I watched and I listened more than I spoke, tagged along after Shikamaru like a particularly intelligent shadow, and didn't speak unless prompted or unless I was absolutely sure what I was saying would be understood and accepted.</p><p>There is nothing worse than having everyone around you laughing at you. I can still feel the humiliation burning. Maybe I should have had thicker skin, but even as an adult, a group of children laughing at me would have still set me near to tears.</p><p>It was one of these games, where we met Chouji. Everyone thinks that because our parents are friends, that's how we met. But it isn't true. Our parents are smarter than that.</p><p>They know that it's the friends you chose yourself that last through your whole life.</p><p>"You can't play ninja with us anymore!" Youbirin Suzu protested, when Chouji asked to join the game. There were only about a dozen of us, but he had established himself as the 'leader' of the game. The blocky purple tattoos on his cheeks identified him as a member of the Suzu clan. As a clan, they very rarely became combat ninja, but focused more on medical ninjutsu.</p><p>They were also known as being good musicians, particuarly with their namesake singing bowls.</p><p>The tattoos looked familiar, and I wondered if I should know of someone with those markings. Then it hit me. Rin. Kakashi's teammate Rin. The medic who had transplanted his eye. She had had those markings too. Uneasily, I wondered if she had chosen a combat role, or if the war had demanded it from her of necessity.</p><p>"But why can't I?" Chouij asked plaintively.</p><p>"Because whenever you play with us, we lose!" Youbirin retorted.</p><p>"Yeah, you're way too slow," chimed his best friend/hanger-on, Jiro Watanabe.</p><p>Chouji looked heartbroken.</p><p>"You know guys," Shikamaru said. "Without him, the teams aren't going to be even. It'd be lame, like if you played a game of shogi with one piece missing." That was my brother, I thought with fondness. He looked out for people. Chouji looked so happy at his intervention, but the next line sent his expression crashing again.</p><p>"But if you have one piece that's totally useless, it's the same thing."</p><p>"Yeah, what he said," Jiro echoed.</p><p>"It's our team, and we don't mind having one less person."</p><p>I swallowed. "We could swap," I offered. "He could be on this team." Shika looked at me in surprise, whether at offer itself or the mere fact that I'd spoken up in public. He knew how awkward I felt trying to talk to people.</p><p>Youbirin scoffed. "You're a girl. We don't want a girl on our team. So lets just play!"</p><p>"Well, if its okay with you, then I guess its fine," one of the others muttered, casting an impatient look around. They didn't care <em> who</em> played, as long as we started.</p><p>"Okay, then its settled!" Youbirin beamed, pleased at having won the argument. "We're so going to win this time."</p><p>Chouji lowered his head and walked off, dragging his feet. Out of the corner of my eye I saw him stop to free a butterfly from a spiders web.</p><p>"Why don't you keep playing," Shikamaru suggested, watching the path of the butterfly as it fluttered away. "I'll be right back."</p><p>I hesitated, caught between the desire to follow him and follow his suggestion. If Shika wasn't here, then I had no real reason, nor desire, to keep playing. On the other hand, if he was going to go and follow Chouji, it'd probably go better if I wasn't there. After all, they had been the best of friends. I'd never forgive myself if I disrupted that.</p><p>I bit my lip, and turned back to the game.</p><p>Shika wasn't 'right back'. The game ended and the children dispersed, so in the end I decided to go looking for him. It wasn't hard to find his chakra, but even without it, I would have been able to find him. He was at his favourite cloud watching spot, after all.</p><p>I cautiously made my way up the stairs, to see Shika and Chouji lying down on the large bench. There was a man there that <em> had</em> to be Chouji's father, watching the two of them with amused fondness.</p><p>I hovered, unsure whether to intrude or retreat back down stairs, when Shikamaru looked up and beckoned me over.</p><p>"This is my sister," he said to Chouji, before adding. "She's troublesome, but I've gotta look out for her."</p><p>I flushed, embarrassed, and looked down at the ground. <em> Way to make a first impression. </em> I didn't take offense though, because Shikamaru found just about everything 'troublesome'. "Hi."</p><p>"Hi," Chouji parroted back, equally shyly, before holding out his snacks. "Would you like a chip?"</p><p>And thus, friendship was born.</p><p>I can't say I was as close to him as Shika was; the two of them just seemed to click. But I hung around with them almost constantly, and neither of them ever made me feel unwanted or excluded. For that, I think, I will always count him as one of my closest of friends.</p><p>It was shortly after that that we were due to start school. The Academy at age five, normally, but they weren't very strict on entrance requirements. Genius children started and graduated a lot earlier, as young as deemed necessary, though they were beginning to tighten those regulations. The war with Cloud had reacted a sort of stalemate, or cold war. There was definite tension, but we were no longer actively fighting. People were beginning to cautiously hope for peace. And that meant that they could spend a lot longer training their children.</p><p>I had taken it for granted that Shikamaru and I would be attending together. It wasn't that I particularly <em> wanted</em> to be a ninja (though I have to admit, I wasn't immune to the lure of it, because my family was a ninja family) but Shika and I were a unit, we went everywhere together. It simply didn't occur to me that this would be any different.</p><p>"Shikako, honey," Mum said one morning after I'd finished helping her with the breakfast dishes. To be honest, I rather liked helping her out in the kitchen. I'd never been a good cook before, and that was with meals and appliances designed for speed and convienience. Learning my way around a kitchen was something I wanted to do before it became absolutely necessary. "Why don't you stay here for a moment, so we can go down to Shogakko to fill in your enrollement."</p><p>"Shogakko…?" I repeated blindsided. Shogakko. The civilian elementary school. It was…very, very rare for a Nara to go there. Even those of the clan that didn't go on to be ninja usually went through the Academy. "I'm… not going to the Academy?"</p><p>"Oh, sweetheart," she said, face softening, and sat me down at the table. Then she explained, very clearly, about how, when I had been a child they had taken me to the hospital, and I had been diagnosed as chakra hypersensitive. It meant, she went on, that I would never be able to use chakra and never be able to be a ninja.</p><p>This was the first I had heard of it, and it confused the hell out of me. I had been using chakra. I <em> knew</em> I had been using chakra. Nothing as obvious as a jutsu, I didn't have enough chakra for that, but I could stick myself to surfaces, and could form chakra strings and light, as well as a dozen other chakra control exercises I had run across in my reading or invented.</p><p>"But… Shika is going," I said, bewildered at this information, grasping the first point of argument that I came across. It took me a little while to order my thoughts, as it occurred to me that what I knew and what others 'knew' weren't the same. There was an inconsistency between my internal world and the external world. It shook me, probably more than it should have.</p><p>"I know," Mum sympathised. "But you're a big girl now. Wont it be nice to make friends without your brother hanging around?"</p><p>It occurred to me that I was being offered a perfect 'out' from the danger of being a ninja. It was tempting. Even if I had decided before that I was going to do something about the disasters I knew were coming… it was tempting.</p><p>But, Shika was my <em> brother</em> . Chouji was my friend. I knew the Konoha Twelve as characters in a story, but I still liked them. I couldn't just abandon them. I couldn't just <em> do nothing.</em></p><p>"I want to go to the Academy," I said firmly, possibly the first time in my life (this time, anyway) I'd made a declarative statement. Mum looked horribly surprised.</p><p>"Shikako." She sighed. "You wont be able to learn what they're teaching. You wont be able to graduate."</p><p>"I want to go. Please," I swallowed. "I'll work really hard and learn everything else, even if I can't use chakra." I was pretty sure I could, but she had started a niggling doubt. Maybe what I had been doing was different. Maybe…</p><p>"Alright," she said, finally. "I'll talk to your father when he gets home and see what he thinks."</p><p>It wasn't a 'yes, you can go', but close to it. Dad very much went with the flow, unless he had a very good reason not to. The ninja Academy covered every topic that the civilian one did, and more besides, so there was no real argument that it would be better for me, except that I would never be able to graduate. Possibly, they were also concerned that being unable to use chakra wouldn't do a heck of a lot for my self-esteem, but ninja didn't really believe in coddling their children. Most of them were of the belief that 'a few hard knocks and they'll work out what they're doing wrong.'</p><p>I wandered outside to find Shika and Chouji, confused and surprisingly upset. Shika was watching clouds, as usual, and I lay down beside him and curled up into his side.</p><p>"Something wrong?" he asked after a moment.</p><p>I sniffed, and considered not telling him, but couldn't see why not to. He'd probably find out tonight anyway, and he might be able to come up with more arguments to convince our parents.</p><p>"I might not be going to the Academy with you," I said.</p><p>"What?" Chouji exclaimed, dropping his bag of chips. "Why not?"</p><p>"They don't think I can use chakra," I said, wrinkling my nose. "One of the medics at the hospital apparently diagnosed me as hypersensitive when I was a baby."</p><p>Shikamaru rolled the new information around in his head. "But you can," he pointed out, frowning. "I've seen you do that light thing."</p><p>I nodded. After a nightmare I would sometimes creep out of my room and into his. After a few nights of walking into things, I'd managed to learn how to call up chakra to my hands for illumination. I hadn't realised he knew that, though.</p><p>"Did you tell them that?"</p><p>I blinked, then sighed. "No?" I offered. <em> Stupid. </em> Now there was a simple solution. I was so <em> stupid</em> . I had been avoiding showing off my skills for fear of being labelled a 'prodigy', something I most definitely did not want or need, but I could have told them <em> that</em> .</p><p>"Alright," I said, resolved. If it came up, I'd show them. I'd rather be a prodigy than excluded.</p><p>But it didn't come to that. As I predicted, Dad had no argument against me going to the Academy with Shikamaru. That was how we came to be signed up to start the Academy at the end of summer.</p><p><hr /></p><p>formatting has become even worse since I last uploaded. Seriously?

			<h2>Academy Arc: Chapter 2</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Against danger it pays to be prepared ~ Aesop</em></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p><em> .</p><p></em></p><p>The night before we started the Academy I didn't sleep that well. It might be more accurate to say that I had a nightmare, probably brought on by the nervousness and anticipation I felt. Of red chakra and pure terror and the helplessness of being blind and dumb. I woke silently, the gasp never leaving my lips, eyes flaring wide and darting about my room. For a second, I thought there was someone standing in the corner. But no. there was no one there. My chakra sense told me the only people in the house was me, my brother, and my parents.</p><p>The human brain was good at facial recognition. Too good sometimes, because it found faces in other things - shadows as a prime example. It was particularly common during hypnagogia, or waking sleep.</p><p>Funnily enough, that didn't really reassure me.</p><p>I gathered chakra to my hands. If you get a great enough concentration of it, chakra can become visible. Something like the Rasengan, where it was not only visible but almost solid took a huge amount, more than I currently had, but I could manage a kind of ghostly light easily enough.</p><p>I called it up, and held my hands out, reassuring myself that there was no one there. It was bright enough to see by, flickering off the floor and walls. I breathed, shakily, and slid my legs off my bed, flinching at the thought of something shooting out from underneath it to grab me.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p><em> Just a nightmare</em> , I told myself. <em> There is nothing here.</em></p><p>The house was so silent; I could hear wind rustling through trees, the faint call of the deer, creaking of floor boards. I stood and crept forward, my footsteps making no sound at all, lighting my way with my hands held out stretched.</p><p>Shikamaru's room was right next to mine. His door was ajar, and I didn't even have to move it to slink into his room. In the preternatural quiet of the house, his breathing was loud and reassuring. I felt the tension drain out of my back.</p><p>As a Nara, I shouldn't be afraid of the dark. It was where we were strongest. But I didn't like to be alone in it.</p><p>I paused in the middle of his room, until some sense told him he wasn't alone and he stirred, squinting at me with bleary eyes, then shuffled over. That was as much an invitation as I was going to get.</p><p>I doused my light and slid into bed. I didn't fall asleep for a long while, but eventually, between one blink and the next, I fell into slumber.</p><p>"Rise and shine! UP, you two!" Someone shrieked at some ungodly hour of the morning. I reached for a pillow to pull over my head, only to find it had been taken, along with all the blankets. Blearily, I looked up, to find mum holding the aforementioned items. Oh well, it wasn't that cold. I curled up, bumping into Shikamaru who had the same idea.</p><p>"Oh, no you don't," she said firmly. "Get up! It's your first day at the Academy, you are not going to be late!"</p><p>Several moments later, I stumbled into my room and attempted to get dressed, having to repeat the process several times as some items found themselves inside out or back to front. But I managed it, and just in time too.</p><p>"If you two aren't down here in the next three seconds…!" Mum threatened. I stumbled out of my room, nearly crashing into Shikamaru, and we slouched downstairs. She hustled us into the backyard. Wait, we were still going to do our stretches? I'd have rather had an extra half hour of sleep. Judging by his face, Shikamaru felt the same.</p><p>But we were both too wise to voice that thought.</p><p>"I woke up in the morning and saw the mountain there," Mum started, voice ringing out clearly, as she reached straight upwards, back tensing, then pulled her arms down in a wide circle. We copied her, and my voice joined in the song as a hoarse mumble. We'd been doing this sequence for years - it had started short, but grown longer and longer as more verses were added. It took us about half an hour to do, now, which was frankly a crazy amount of time. I could recall many days where I'd done no where near that amount of exercise, let alone, that amount as a warm-up.</p><p>Granted, it did do wonders for waking you up. By the time we got to 'I could have been a solider, or a dancer, or a tree. I could have been a farmer, or a merchant, or a queen', (the moves for which were actually quite fun) I was most definitely awake. After we had finished, we went inside and ate breakfast before getting cleaned up. By this time, it was starting to get to a respectable hour to be awake, and it was nearly time for us to leave for the Academy. It was a fair distance to travel from our house, after all.</p><p>The Ninja Academy, surprisingly enough, was located next to the mountain in the same building as the Hokage's Office, and Mission Assignment Desk. It seemed some what counterintuitive to have so many young and noisy children next to such a serious work environment, until one realised that it was perhaps the most defensible location in the entire village. In fact the only safer places were inside the mountain itself.</p><p>The fact that I even realised that meant that I was far more affected by my new world than I had anticipated.</p><p>When we got to the Academy, they had a small introduction ceremony for us. Both Mum and Dad came to watch and sent us off to sit with the other children with an admonished 'be good'. The Third Hokage was there, and he spoke at length about learning and doing well and forging friendships and holding on to the Will of Fire. It was actually a very inspirational speech, but I spent most of it surreptitiously looking over my classmates trying to spot the rookie 9. Everyone was so <em> small</em> .</p><p>It surprised me a bit at how many children there were here. I'd kinda had the impression that there was only one class per year. That wasn't true. There were more like five or six. I guess that makes sense, when you think that not all individuals would last to graduation, and not all those would pass. There had to be more that three teams refilling the shinobi ranks every year, or the ninja population would decline very, very fast.</p><p>Two teachers called out a class list and led their new classes away before Iruka-sensei took to the stage. He looked so very young and awkward. "Right. With me are: Aburame, Shino…" I listened closely, hoping I was in the same class as Shikamaru. I hadn't even given it a thought that we might be separated - that I wouldn't be with Rookie Nine.</p><p>"… Nara, Shikako, Nara Shikamaru…"</p><p>I gave a slight smile to Shika, happy we were together. He nodded, and got up to slouch over to where the others were waiting. I could pick out Shino, the first one to be called, and Chouji, obviously. Hinata was easy to see, with her shy demenor even if her bloodline didn't give her away. Sakura was also blindingly obvious with her bright pink hair, though she looked to be just as shy as Hinata.</p><p>"… Uzumaki, Naruto," Iruka-sensei's voice hitched, just slightly. "And Yamanaka, Ino. Thankyou. Please follow me."</p><p>He led us away, and I looked over my shoulder, to see Mum and Dad wave us goodbye. Several of the parents around them were shuffling uneasily. I had my suspicions as to why.</p><p>The classroom we were led to was surprisingly large. There were huge windows set into the far wall, to let in natural light and provide an escape route. Even though Konoha had many things in common with Japan - where houses were small and compact - ninja did not like being in confined spaces, leading to buildings that were larger and more spacious than you would expect. The class room had benches arranged in rows, each slightly higher than the last, auditorium style. The front had a large black board and there was a teachers desk slightly to the side. There were several bland educational posters spread over the walls to try and interject a bit of life into the classroom.</p><p>I slouched down next to Shika in one of the back benches. In my old world, sitting at the back of the class was usually a sign of uninterested students, here, it meant that there was no one behind us, which was the mark of a <em> good</em> ninja. It's strange how perspective changes things. It took far longer than it should for the rest of the class to get seated, but that's how working with kids goes, I guess. I watched with half lidded eyes as the other students sized each other up and Iruka vainly tried to keep order.</p><p>Most of the morning was spent with the minute of first day at school, assigning text books, making sure everyone had the appropriate stationary, listing the rules and expectations, and making name badges so we could all get to know each other. All perfectly normal first day things that I had gone through more than a dozen times before. It disillusioned me quite rapidly to the fact that this might be ninja school, but it was still school. Oh, joy.</p><p>It wasn't that I didn't like school… it was just, well, you've got to be slightly reluctant to go.</p><p>Some kids were paying diligent attention to Iruka-sensei - Sakura, Hinata, Shino - while several more had zoned out - Shika was sleeping and Chouji was eating - and I could predict that very soon Kiba and Naruto were going to start causing disruptions.</p><p>Luckily, this was the point where the bell for the lunch rang.</p><p>"Alright, kids!" Iruka-sensei half-yelled over the sudden explosion of noise. "You have one hour! I want you all back here when the bell rings!"</p><p>I poked Shikamaru awake and we both wandered outside, Chouji trailing after Shikamaru, munching on some chips. Only the last year students were allowed to leave the Academy grounds, so we found an empty patch of grass surrounding the main field to eat our lunch.</p><p>"Thoughts?" I asked, idly watching the rest of the children find places to sit and eat. Some alone, some in groups. Some of them appeared to know each other, while others were awkward with new friendships. Lunch was divided into year levels, so all the children who had started today were here. The other classes would have lunch at different times.</p><p>There was Shino, sitting alone by the trees. There was Hinata. And there… there was Naruto.</p><p>There were numerous problems with the Third Hokage's secrecy laws. How everyone had known about it in the first place… Group mentality had shown that the ideals of the group persisted long after any founding members hand left - or the true reasons for the behaviour had been forgotten. It was like the old story with the monkeys pulling each other off the ladder. Not knowing <em> why</em> they were treating Naruto badly wouldn't mean they <em> didn't</em> .</p><p>The Gaara situation only became so bad because people kept trying to assassinate him. His instinctive knowledge of moving sand hadn't helped matters, but he hadn't been homicidal before that.</p><p>Perhaps it wasn't anything to do with the way people treated him, but to keep Naruto himself from finding out. Uzumaki Mito had invented the Kyuubi seal and she had used it on <em> herself.</em> The seal had been created for a willing vessel, unlike the other jinchuriki in which the vessel was as trapped as the bijuu. I knew he could remove the seal himself and release Kyuubi. Did you want a child knowing that? That all it would take to get back at people would be to remove a tiny piece of paper from a cage? The temptation would be huge.</p><p>Did Gaara's seal have that option? I don't know. Clearly his seal worked differently, allowing the use of sand and partial transformations and releases as it did. Naruto didn't have that option. Other than his healing, he gained no tangible powers.</p><p>It was certainly something to think about. But I have to admit, Naruto at this age, wasn't what I had unconsciously been expecting. He was young, and quiet and a little sullen. He was easy to overlook. It was very different from the genin that he was in the show. I guess that was the point.</p><p>"Troublesome," Shikamaru declared after a long silence.</p><p>"I like Iruka-sensei," Chouji offered, in between mouthfuls.</p><p>I nodded in agreement. "He seems nice."</p><p>There was an explosion of noise, as kids began congregating in the middle of the field. They'd finished their lunch and were starting a game of ninja. Chouji perked up.</p><p>"Can we go play?" He asked eagerly.</p><p>I looked at Shika who shrugged. "Sure." Neither of us were particularly enthusiastic at the idea, but hey, if Chouji wanted to. We wandered over there, to find our old 'friend' directing the game.</p><p>"I told you, he can't play anymore!" Youbirin said, annoyed, when we asked to join in.</p><p>Chouji slumped, dejected. Shika and I exchanged glances.</p><p>"So troublesome," Shikamaru said.</p><p>"Never mind, guys," Chouji said. "I'll just… go."</p><p>I shook my head. "We can play our own game," I offered.</p><p>Youbirin sneered, "There's three of you. I'm sure that'll be fun."</p><p>I scowled at him, and he seemed quite taken back. So did Chouji, come to think of it. But then I spied an unmistakable blond head, hovering sadly at the sidelines. Naruto was watching the game. Likely, they hadn't let him play either. I nudged Shikamaru.</p><p>"But four of us will be," he drawled, easily catching on, before strolling past Youbirin. Chouji and I followed easily. It was strange that we had made Shikamaru our leader, given that he would rather cloud-watch than play, but since neither Chouji or I could, he had taken the spot by default.</p><p>There was a gasp from behind us. "You're going to play with <em> him?</em> Our parents told us to stay away from him!" We ignored it.</p><p>Naruto, peering through his bangs, watched us approach with a mixture of sullen hope and distrust.</p><p>"So," Shika said, slouching to a stop. "Did you want to play ninja with us?"</p><p>The look of joy on his face was kind of heartbreaking.</p><p>The rule goes, if you have one person staring at a spot on the pavement, you're a weirdo. If you have two people, there must be something interesting, and others will stop to see what you're looking at. In that vein, as we started playing, more and more people joined in. We had quite a game going by the time the end of lunch bell rang. Both Chouji and Naruto were practically shinning with joy.</p><p>After lunch we had taijutsu class a.k.a. PE, the class I had despised above all others before, and one that seemed highly necessary this time. Being a ninja involved a heck of a lot of running and jumping, even if I never specialised in taijutsu. Which meant I was just going to have to suck it up and try.</p><p>It went worse than I had feared. I was actually a little <em> baffled</em> at how badly it went. Speed and stamina wise, I was only slightly above Shika, who wasn't even trying. He managed a lazy shuffling jog for about three steps before Iruka sensei went to glare at some body else. I wasn't exactly surprised at coming last - I'd developed 'sports day-itis' on many occasions in order to avoid compulsory athletics days at school because I always came in last at everything - but I was a little surprised at how <em> far</em> behind I was.</p><p>It was a little embarrassing to be honest. It certainly put a damper on my wonder and anticipation. It's one thing to <em> know</em> that being a ninja is hard work, its another to have your arms and legs burning on the tenth lap of the grounds when you still have another ten to go. In a world with no cars, <em> this</em> was how ninja got around. Running.</p><p>Oh. Joy.</p><p>And after running, there was stretching, and sit ups and press ups and an obstacle course… There were slalom poles and games of catch. We were too young to be trusted with actual kunai yet, even blunt or wooden ones, but it we were practicing throwing all the same.</p><p>It was incredibly, incredibly tempting to give up. It was <em> hard</em> to motivate myself. Admittedly I had never been particularly hard working before, either. I hadn't been a genius, but I had been smart enough to pick up on things easier than my peers, allowing me to cruise through school with hardly any effort at all. Physical prowess had never mattered before, and I found that I was incredibly unprepared for it to count.</p><p>I admit, I started to have serious doubts about my future as a ninja right about then. It was a little disheartening. Certainly it was very humbling. Maybe, maybe, I had been harbouring a small hope that I could be… brilliant. I could be strong.</p><p>I had died young. Longer than most ninja were want to live, probably, but still less than a third of my life span, according to the measures of the world. I was close with my parents and siblings, proud of my university degree and content with my job but there had been nothing about my life that ten-year-old me would have looked at and said 'that's what I want to be'. Ten-year-old me had wanted glory and fame and greatness. I? I had been no one special.</p><p>Maybe, I wanted that once more.</p><p>It was silly to think that the path of a ninja would give that to me. Too much fan fiction, I guess, not enough attention paid to the cannon fodder characters. I had the sneaking suspicion that that was what I was.</p><p>But, well… it would be pretty pathetic to give up after just one class.</p><p>Thankfully, that was the last class of the day. Iruka-sensei let us go with a half smile and a relieved look, and everyone seemed to gain another burst of energy as they left the classroom. Even Shika looked awake.</p><p>"Man, that was so boring!" Kiba exclaimed, barrelling down the hallway. "Freedom!"</p><p>"Troublesome," Shika sighed, as a teacher poked their head out of a doorway to yell at him for running inside.</p><p>"It wasn't that bad," Chouji offered, pulling out a bag of chips.</p><p>I 'hmmmed'. "We met Naruto."</p><p>Said boy perked up at the sound of his name and looked over at us. Outside the Academy building there was a crowd of parents mingling and waiting to pick kids up from their first day at school. I noticed quite a few <em> look</em> at Naruto, before shuffling their kids away from him. It wasn't quite a glare, but it was definitely not friendly. He noticed it too, and glared at the ground.</p><p>"There's dad," Shika said, bumping my shoulder and slouching off towards him.</p><p>I hesitated, then turned to Naruto. "See you tomorrow," I said lamely.</p><p>His returning smile was brilliant. "Yeah! We can play ninja again, right?"</p><p>I nodded, and ambled off. Dad had most definetly seen our conversation, but I couldn't tell what he was thinking.</p><p>He didn't say anything about it immediately though, swinging me up on his shoulders and Shikamaru on his back. Trying to walk us home would take probably five times longer than carrying us, since I was tired and achy, and Shikamaru's normal speed of movement was approximately a crawl.</p><p>"How was school?" He drawled.</p><p>"Troublesome," Shika answered. I giggled. It was just such a typical answer.</p><p>"It was fine," I said. "Iruka-sensei is nice. And we met some new people."</p><p>"So I saw," Dad said softly. "Like that blond kid you were talking to?" He raised his voice.</p><p>I nodded, even though he couldn't see it. "His name is Naruto. He's okay. Do you know… people treat him weird." I changed my sentence midway through. I didn't want to give away too much.</p><p>He didn't react. He was far, far too good a ninja for that. But I think he was still a little surprised, more that we had brought it up than that we had noticed.</p><p>"You should do what you think is right," Shikaku said. I'd like to have said that I would continue trying, even if he'd forbidden me, but I don't know if I could have. I disliked disappointing people, particularly my parents.</p><p>But they were big on letting us think for ourselves. We made our own choices, and our own mistakes. I pondered. "What does daddy think is the right thing?" I asked.</p><p>It struck me then that people weren't afraid of Naruto per se, but of him letting the Kyuubi out. Some people must have known that Kushina was the vessel. It cant have been an absolute secret, not in a village of ninja. But if the weakened seal during birth was a secret… that meant they had no idea why the Kyuubi had gotten loose. The Third was in a lose-lose situation. Knowledge of the weakened seal would endanger the jinchuriki and cause panic, but if he didn't say, then people could only wonder why?</p><p>She had been too close to Konoha to have been killed in battle. Which left the assumption that she had let it out willingly.</p><p>And if Kushina had, a fully grown, capable Shinobi, then a child… would he do the same?</p><p>Of course, Jinchuriki got a bad rap. Whether it was undeserved or not, caused or not, it was still fact that many of them were homicidal and unstable. Keeping your distance from someone like that was just common sense. And telling your children to, doubly more so.</p><p>"Why do you ask?"</p><p>"Because Daddy knows things I don't," I answered, not missing the fact that he had dodged the question.</p><p>He chuckled. "Daddy knows many things you don't. What do you think of him?"</p><p>I petted his hair absently. The way it stuck up made me assume that it was coarse and harsh, but it was surprisingly soft.</p><p>"He's annoying," I said truthfully. "But so is Kiba and no one tells us to stay away from him."</p><p>He chuckled, maybe recognising the name. I wouldn't be surprised if he did.</p><p>"Do you know who Naruto's parents are?" I asked.</p><p>He didn't tense, he was too good for that, but there was a careful note to his voice that I would have missed if I hadn't been listening for it. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>"Because you're old," I said promptly, well aware that that wasn't what he was asking. "And because everyone says to Shikamaru," I sighed heavily and theatrically. "'You're just like your father,' then they leave him alone, because they know you're awesome." I nodded. "So did Naruto's parents do something bad?"</p><p>I knew Shikamaru was awake, but he opened his eyes for that.</p><p>I probably should have felt bad about putting him on the spot like that, but I didn't.</p><p>"No one knows who his parents are," Shikaku said carefully.</p><p>"But he has a last name," I objected. Some orphans didn't, case in point – Tenten. How hard could it be to go Uzumaki-Uzumaki?</p><p>"It could be an honorary name," Shikaku said. "After someone who died the day he was born."</p><p>Translation – he could have been called Uzumaki because he was the vessel, not the vessel because he was an Uzumaki. Which, actually, was perfectly plausible. If people hadn't known that she was pregnant at the time. I suspect people didn't like to think of it.</p><p>I 'hmm'ed thoughtfully and let the topic drop. It was, after all, a conversational minefield. It had certainly given me things to think about.</p><p>That was really all it took to befriend Naruto, a game and a goodbye. In the morning, as Iruka-sensei tried to bring the class to order, he approached us hesitantly with wary hope in his eyes. I had no idea how many times people had become distant from him after their parents had had a word with him, but as far as I could see, he was canon Naruto. He wasn't <em> dangerous</em> . I kicked out the chair next to me and his face lit up with such joy that it almost hurt to look at.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Academy Arc: Chapter 3</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 3</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><em> Childhood is fleeting.</em></p><p><em> .</p><p></em></p><p><hr /></p><p>In addition to attending the Academy, I was also signed up for special 'kunoichi classes'. These started a week after the Academy did and took place after the regular academy hours so were technically more of a 'club' than a 'class'. They weren't mandatory, but all the girls were strongly encouraged to attend. I think the only one who didn't from our year was Hinata, probably on the basis that it wasn't appropriate for a Hyuuga, or that she had her own, better tutors on the subject. On the surface the classes were reasonably innocuous. We learnt about festivals and holidays of the major lands, we learnt ikebana and basic cooking. We learnt sewing and embroidery. We learnt tea ceremonies and how to apply makeup and wear formal kimono. We learnt instruments. All typical, girlish things. They were all also things that would aid us with infiltration. We were taught how to sing and how to act and how to dance. It was extremely thorough training and none of the other girls even realised it.</p><p>Ikebana taught us which flowers were poisonous and where they were found and how to arrange a bouquet to look beautiful while hiding death inside. It taught us how to pass coded messages to each other, hidden in flower meanings. We could imitate geisha or highborn ladies. We could pretend to be natives to any country of the elemental nations.</p><p>We were taught how to draw, to sketch the face of people we needed to identify, to hide messages within images to get them past scrutiny.</p><p>This was where I met Sakura and Ino.</p><p>The first day was difficult. Shika and Chouji weren't there, and I didn't know any of the other girls. It's probably a little sad to admit that I used a child as a shield, even disregarding that I was a child myself. But Shikamaru was good at it, with his nonchalant, 'I don't care' attitude, where I seemed to take everything too personally. He was my buffer to the world. When Suzume-sensei told us to go and gather some flowers, I stood awkwardly to the side.</p><p>I felt <em> shy</em> . Terrified of trying to introduce myself when, it seemed, everyone had naturally fallen into groups already. I was lost.</p><p>Then I noticed Sakura. Her pink hair should have stood out horribly, but it blended remarkably well. She was alone, diligently picking flowers, as we had been told. I licked my lips nervously and headed towards her.</p><p>But someone got there before me.</p><p>I couldn't see what Ami said, but I definitely saw Ino's throw. A take down with flowers. It was a wonder that Ino didn't specialise in thrown weapons.</p><p>"That was a good throw," I said, approaching Ino and Sakura, hands fiddling with my flowers. Several of them were bringing to look mangled. It shouldn't be so hard to approach two young girls. But it was.</p><p>Ino beamed at the compliment. "Thank you! She deserved it! I'm Ino, and this is Sakura."</p><p>"Shikako," I replied, relieved that she was being so friendly. God, how pathetic could I get? "Umm," I said when the silence stretched. "What flowers do you have? I could only find these."</p><p>Flowers were no where near my best subject, and it wasn't like we had really started learning anyway. I doubted anything important would be covered in the first week or so. Half of what I was holding was probably weeds. But I should have remembered that Ino's parents ran a flower shop, because she picked up the conversation easily, chattering along and helping Sakura and I with our selections.</p><p>And that was pretty much that.</p><p>Ino was an incredibly gregarious girl. She seemed to know everyone. And had absolutely no compunctions about sharing what she knew, either. It was with her that I discovered people watching. Shikamaru could keep his clouds, this, this was <em> interesting.</em></p><p>I wanted to know how people interacted, I wanted to know who got on well with who. I wanted to know who did well in which class and which skill and why. I wanted to know who had shinobi parents and how much of their skills that explained. Apparently, this was something that was <em> normal.</em> I was a girl. I gossiped. It was… something of a revelation.</p><p>I still wasn't particularly sociable, preferring to watch others than interact with them but a small group of friends was better than nothing.</p><p>Ino and Sakura and I still hung out with Shika and Chouji, and Naruto was there constantly. He was exhausting. Not just physically, which he was, always running and playing, but socially exhausting. I wasn't really used to dealing with anyone other than Shika for long periods of time, and Naruto couldn't be more different.</p><p>We ended up 'recruiting' Kiba, as the only other student with near as much energy, just to keep him occupied.</p><p>Naruto was annoying. He wasn't abused or treated badly. People didn't really even glare that much. To them, he was just <em> there</em> , as unimportant as the trees by the side of the road. He was the epitome of 'somebody else's problem'. Most children are, and that 'somebody else' is their parent. Naruto didn't have parents, and the orphanage caregivers were run so ragged with so many children they had no time for individual attention. He just… wasn't important to anyone. Yeah, it might have been emotional neglect, but it wasn't done intentionally or maliciously. There was just no time. But he wanted attention. He craved it. And he would go to extreme lengths to get it. He was a brat and knowing <em> why</em> didn't make it any easier to deal with. He was obnoxious and loud and insulting and for all his desire to be a ninja never sat still to listen to anything he didn't deem 'cool'.</p><p>But it was <em> Naruto</em> . I knew he was going to be great, and kind and a loyal friend. If I could just deal with him, help him, teach him a little, get him to think things through, then things would be better. If I could just be his <em> friend</em> …</p><p>I tried.</p><p>There were other hiccups. Children don't all get along, and those that are different, weird, are identified immediately. It's not always malicious, but it's there. Ami, who I had met an Kunoichi classes, was one that took exception to Sakura and I. We were the quiet ones, the smart ones, the ones who hung out with the boys. We didn't <em> fit</em> .</p><p>I don't want to cast her as the stereotypical bully. She could be kind and polite. Outside of class, I once ran into her serving customers at her mother's tea shop and she was as polite to me as any other. She took her job seriously; a good trait for a ninja.</p><p>Inside of school, however, there were… confrontations.</p><p>"God, Ino, you used to be cool. Now you're picking up all the weirdos," Ami said, one lunchtime, sneering at the three of us. Ino, I knew, would be happily accepted into anyone's social circle, but chose to stay with us.</p><p><em> Chose</em> . Even at six, maybe especially at six, that's a hard choice to make, and an even harder one to stick by. I know I had, in my previous life, drifted away from friends from things much less than out right confrontation.</p><p>I wish I could say I had retorted with something so witty that she ran away crying. Truthfully, as always happens, my throat locked up tightly and I was silent. Humiliation, this is thy name. I know, I <em> know</em> that it wouldn't have been so bad if I had been able to reply with anything, anything at all, but I couldn't, I've never been able too, and my silence just makes things worse.</p><p>But Ino, Ino is brilliant. "The only weirdo here is you," she retorted, not in the least bit cowed. She tossed her head, long blonde strands highlighting the movement. "At least I have friends, all you've got is mindless sycophants."</p><p>I was impressed. As insults go, it was children's level, but I've known adults that couldn't say 'sycophants'. And Ami clearly had no idea what it meant. She turned red and stomped off, and the laughter, the dreaded laughter, followed her.</p><p>"Thanks," I muttered, half ashamed I couldn't even defend myself.</p><p>Ino just smiled, cheerful and confident, like nothing could shake her. "That's what friends are for, right Sakura?"</p><p>Sakura looked as startled and afraid as I felt, eyes wide under her shaggy pink hair. But she nodded timidly. "Right."</p><p>And of course, classes were progressing. I was well ahead of the others in the basics - reading, writing, mathematics, history - and usually ended up bringing my own books to class to read while Iruka-sensei taught. It was a skill that any school child picked up; the ability to simultaneously pay just enough attention to know what the teacher was talking about, while aimlessly gazing out the window. I read, instead. The teachers didn't care as long as you didn't disrupt the class, which was why Shikamaru got away with sleeping through everything short of Taijutsu training, when Naruto and Kiba usually ended up with three or four detentions a week between them.</p><p>Even though I was well ahead in theoretical classes, I worked hard to bring myself up to par in the physical department. Six weeks later, I was nearly on average with the other students - due to far more extra running than I ever thought I'd do - when I realised with blinding clarity that made me feel like an idiot just why I was so far behind.</p><p>They were unconsciously enhancing their muscles with chakra.</p><p>They could no more control it than they could their blood flow, but like blood, exercise increased the amount of it flowing in their muscles. I wasn't doing this. I was <em> aware</em> of my chakra in a way they weren't, consciously aware of it. When I was exercising it was flowing exactly as it always flowed.</p><p>I felt rather stupid. It was obvious in hindsight. If I focused, I could even 'see'? 'feel'? the flows of chakra in them. It wasn't Byakugan standards, but rather like knowing I had my own chakra, like seeing the chakra in the air - it all resonated.</p><p>That became my new project to work on at home. How to enhance my muscles as ninja did so easily. I could, of course, see the benefits of continuing to practise without it, however much I disliked the extra work, but the higher the base, the better my improvement would be once I added chakra.</p><p>Logically, I knew that, and continued as I had been, albeit with little enthusiasm.</p><p>There's not really any way to describe how it feels to channel chakra. It's like breathing. You just do it.</p><p>But when you internalise it, channel it to your muscles, its like being superman. You want to leap tall buildings in a single bound. You want to yell 'I am God! I defy the laws of physics!' No wonder so many ninja are nut cases. It's a pure adrenaline rush. Nothing compares to it.</p><p>It was easy to use chakra like this, to simply enhance things you could have done anyway, because chakra was part physical energy, generated by the body. They fit together naturally.</p><p>On the same note it was no wonder that chakra exhaustion was lethal. Chakra might be thought of as the 'extra' energy that the body (and mind and spirit) produced. Stuff that you didn't need to move or to breathe or to metabolise, so you could use it to do jutsu. Once that reserve was used up, you could either stop, or start taking energy from your muscles. That was chakra debt. First went the skeletal muscles, the arms and the legs. It felt like they were filled with lactic acid, too weak and shaky to contract anymore. Then, if you kept going, you started drawing energy from other muscles, ones that didn't normally fatigue, like your lungs, and heart. Breathing grew difficult, your heart stopped beating. You died.</p><p>We covered that very clearly at the Academy, early on, along with many, many warnings not to try and use chakra unsupervised.</p><p>I had average sized chakra reserves, on the small side for a ninja, but normal for a kunoichi. Nara have never been exceptional in that department, but we make use of what we have cleverly. Mine may have been slightly larger than expected, since I had been practising using it, and that does help build reserves.</p><p>You could build your chakra stores, but they wouldn't keep increasing forever. Just like there was a limit to how fast you could run, or how smart you could get. Training would help push those limits, for you to reach your greatest capacity but there was a limit. The maximum that your body could allow. Most ninja never reached that maximum. There was always a little more training they could squeeze out, a little more their chakra capacity could increase. Of course, the closer you got, the less that 'little bit more' was. Though failing that, their control could improve a little more.</p><p>I had exceptional control over my own chakra but it wasn't just the chakra in my body that I could sense. It was everywhere. It was in the air I breathed, the food I ate, like persistent smoke. It caused me to cough whenever I paid too much attention to it, further cementing my reputation as a sickly child. Whether it was natural chakra or chakra residue from jutsu or emitted from people I didn't know, and resolved not to mess with it until I understood more. The last thing I wanted was to become a stone statue.</p><p>Later on, that overdeveloped chakra sense would come in handy. I could sense the bodies of chakra that were other people, sense residue from leftover jutsu, point out chakra enhance traps and so forth. Anyplace that chakra had been used or anything that chakra had been used on was lit up like a beacon to my senses.</p><p>In our first year at the academy we weren't taught about chakra, other than that it existed. As I had found out for myself, chakra reserves aren't really that large until seven or eight years of age. We wouldn't be taught to use chakra till our third year, and it would be our last year before we were taught anything even remotely resembling a jutsu.</p><p>I had run through dozens of chakra control exercises. I hadn't managed water walking, because drowning was too much a risk as a child, but many other exercises were possible. The wall walking exercise had been only the start. There were chakra strings. There was the leaf sticking, that I remembered from the show. And from leaves, I progressed to ever more brittle and fragile things. At first, my chakra had ripped through paper easily until I managed to adjust the force of it's output. I had been terribly proud when I managed to stick rice paper to my hand and slowly, carefully, without rushing, fold it into a clumsy, lopsided origami crane. I had managed it without a single tear.</p><p>Chakra was difficult to manipulate once it had been expelled. That was why chakra strings - like those used on puppets - took so much concentration. But it wasn't impossible. And I liked working with my chakra. This was something I could do for fun, bend it and twist it and <em> see</em> the outcome.</p><p>One of the things we <em> were</em> drilled mercilessly on was hand seals. How to recognise them, how to form them, what they were most often associated with. The Tiger seal, for example, has the index and middle finger held straight, and is a common end seal for many fire techniques. Useful information, yes, but hand seals were a bitch to do . I had no idea how people managed to do them so fast. My child's fingers were awkward and clumsy as I forced them into positions that were entirely unnatural. The only one I could manage with ease was Snake, the clasping of both hands. Even then, in the time taken to form, hold and disengage, (something just as important as the first two) a skilled shinobi could run through three or more seals.</p><p>But there were more than enough things to keep me occupied researching. There were so many things that I wanted to know, like, what was it about shadows that let us control them, and control people with them? Shadows were only areas where sunlight didn't reach, they were nothing physical. What was it about that lack that made them special? Of course, there was much about shadows in folk law and myth and our clan, unsurprisingly, had a great many books on the subject.</p><p>Shadows have long been a part of folklore. Along with reflections and portraits, they're thought to be the soul, or part of it. The shadow is the negative double of the body, the alter ego of the soul, and sometimes an image of evil.</p><p>The shadow can represent the darkness of the personal unconsciousness, the other, unfathomed side of the personality, the secret sharer. It is everything that the individual refuses to accept or understand about themselves. If not assured and integrated, it may become evil and destructive.</p><p>It is for this reason that the Nara believe in self acceptance. Our clan might be considered lazy and unmotivated to most - and we are, to a large degree - but we know ourselves. We try not to self-destruct. It's not so much as always remaining calm as knowing why you're angry and what you're prepared to do about it. Even if that 'what' is 'anything'.</p><p>It's a little terrifying, looking deep into your heart and asking 'what would I do if someone hurt my brother?'. Not 'what should I do?' or 'what would I be expected to do?' but actually, truthfully, all pretences aside, what would I do?</p><p>We're not always the people we like to think we are.</p><p>Of course, it wasn't all school work. At home, I began to explore the clan grounds. The clan was rather large and sprawling. From the show I think I had assumed that Shikamaru's family was the entirety of the Nara clan. It wasn't. In fact, those that lived within the walls of Konoha weren't the entirety of the clan. The Nara ran many farms in Fire country to supply the ingredients for our medicines. Farming took up a great deal of room, and Konoha proper was a walled village. There simply wasn't space.</p><p>Within Konoha itself, we had a small forested area where we ran a herd of deer, as well as a few workshops that produced our medicine and research.</p><p>Deer are odd creatures. At once supremely intelligent and incredibly skittish. They are very intelligent, they seem to know instinctively which plants will make them better when they are ill. Deer are pretty good at looking after themselves. They don't need a lot of attention or managing. In fact, they're the kind of animals that you can kill with kindness. Too much human attention makes them shocky. I think a lot of the Nara attitude stems from that; acknowledging and accepting the fact that sometimes, if you just leave it alone, it'll come right on its own. Lazy, sure, but pragmatic too. It made me wonder if our clan had started our medical theory not from the deer but from observing them. There are some parts of our research that directly involved the deer though. Because male deer, the stags and the harts, shed and regrow their antlers every year, there was some serious study being done into the ways that they do this, in the hopes of adapting the principles to allow people to regrow limbs and tissues. A lot of it, however was based on herbs and plants and the chemicals found in them, much the same as my old world. There was less synthesising of chemicals, and I don't know that chemistry itself was as advanced, but the results were impressive all the same.</p><p>I spent a lot of time in the workrooms. They smelt strangely, of the medicines that were prepared, of the herbs that were hung up to dry, of deer and of smoke, but it wasn't an unpleasant strangeness. The workers, mostly my aunts and uncles and cousins, though there were a few hirelings who were unrelated to us, were more than happy to indulge my curiosity about what they were doing. I was put to work with a mortar and pedestal more than once to grind herbs to paste.</p><p>The clan was pleased with my interest in medicine, having, as they did, that diagnosis from the hospital.</p><p>I struggled through the 'basic' textbooks on the subject. It wasn't that the concepts were unfamiliar to me, but the change in language meant I had to learn everything all over again. I could have gotten the same information from reading a dictionary, but it was easier to learn in context. I was thankful to note that the principles seemed the same, despite the differences in worlds.</p><p>I was vaguely aware that deer velvet was considered a medicine but in my world it was regarded as something of a herbal remedy, the sort for new age health nuts. However, I remembered with a jolt, here, the Nara were regarded as expert medical specialists. They were the ones that supplied Tsunade with the information that allowed her to reverse Chouji's food pill poisoning. I had to try and stop applying knowledge from my past world; things were too different here.</p><p>The medical sciences were nothing short of amazing - once I got over the fact that the most important and essential medical tools weren't needles and scalpels but paper and ink. Just about everything that we used machines for, they used seals. To stabilise patients, to monitor them, during surgery - all seals. Sealing and medicine went together hand in glove. They had more use, or more easily recognised use, in the stable environment of the hospital than being weirdly adapted in the every changing realm of combat.</p><p>It had never occurred to me before, but Tsunade was probably equal to, if not greater in sealing knowledge than Jiraiya, if her Rebirth seal was any indication. Orochimaru's dabbling in cursed seals was also explained by his scientific leanings.</p><p>Seals were the machines of the elemental nations. Seals are Kanji. That surprised me to discover. I had always thought they would involve a specialised alphabet or complex symbols - esoteric lines and circles - but it wasn't. It was Kanji. Yes, there were specific ways in which they should be combined for best effect, but in that manner it was more like writing a contract or telling a story. That was … interesting to learn.</p><p>Of course, it was limited. It took time and space and ink and paper. Only the very best seal masters could use seals in combat, because they were the only ones that could design or alter and apply a seal with merely a twist of chakra, a hand seal and maybe some blood. Minato Namikaze was lauded as a genius for a reason.</p><p>I noted it as an avenue I definitely wanted to explore. I very much doubted I would ever get to any sort of mastery of it - probably never more than the basics - but there was still a lure to it. If nothing else, storage scrolls would be handy.</p><p>These things filled my time admirably. As the year passed and we entered our second year of the academy, little changed. The lessons became slightly harder, slightly harsher, slightly more geared towards the 'truth' of ninja missions. It was a slow process to familiarise us with what would be expected of us - so slow it was almost unnoticeable. We were being conditioned.</p><p>In our second year, we started learning how to throw kunai and we started to learn taijutsu.</p><p>At the academy we were all taught an adaptation of the basic Konoha-ryu style, called the Shorin-ryu, the 'small forest style'. It was a version of the Konoha based taijutsu style that had been adapted specifically for children and teenagers. It emphasised dodging and deflection with the understanding that any opponents we encountered were likely to be taller, stronger and faster than us. On the surface, it appeared to be a rather simplistic style, with limited numbers of strikes, block and kicks. Of course, given that it was being taught to children, this straightforwardness was probably more an advantage than a disadvantage. There were no flashy moves or complicated locks; things that could easily fall apart in actual combat. It was the basics of the basics, something that we could build on with our family styles, or simply once we left the academy and started gaining personal experience.</p><p>I had studied Karate before, which sounds like it should have given me a bonus in learning taijutsu here. That really wasn't the case. For one, it had been so many years previously that I had forgotten nearly all the technical details. For another, it had been in a separate body. But thirdly, perhaps more importantly, I had never had to actually use Karate in a real life situation. The closest I had come was the single Tournament I had participated in, but I was intelligent enough to know that that wasn't even close. Here, Taijutsu wasn't just a hobby, it was real. It was something that people lived and died by. And what we were taught reflected that.</p><p>On the other hand, there were things that I had learnt that stood me well. Not the techniques, but more important things than that. Our motto had been 'First the body, then the mind, then the spirit'. Meaning that your body tired first. Your muscles ached, and trembled, you panted, you sweated. But you kept going. Then your mind became tired. You acknowledged your fatigue. Your determination wavered. You wanted to give up. But your spirit kept you going. It wasn't quite 'never give up' but more 'persevere. Keep going despite that'. It was a hard lesson to learn, to push yourself so hard and so far. Harder still when you were solo training.</p><p>The second was intent. 'The easiest way to win a fight is to avoid it'. There is no reason to fight if you don't have to. But if there is, if you have to fight, commit to it 100%. Commit to every action as though it will win the fight. You should throw the first punch and throw the last punch and make sure the two of them are the same strike. In the academy they talked about this, they called it 'Ikken Hissatsu'. 'To kill with one strike'. Here they actually meant it.</p><p>When we sparred, the others had the tendency to treat it as a game. I was tempted to. Throwing light punches and kicks, dancing around weak attacks, it's fun and easy. And I had no real desire to hurt any of my classmates. On the other hand, it was easy. A knee to the stomach, an elbow to the temple, a palm strike to the jaw - fast and brutal moves that folded the others to the ground instantly.</p><p>After a few days, the others started calling me 'KO Shikako'. It almost made me laugh. It wouldn't last, not as they got better at blocking and dodging, at overcoming that instinctive flinch at violence, at protecting their vital spots, but I'd improve too.</p><p>We didn't do a lot of freeform sparring, not at first, anyway. It was still mostly stamina exercises, like we had already been doing; running, press-ups, setups, training bag work. There were flexibility exercises, stretches and slalom poles. There were obstacle courses and games like dodge ball. And there were rigidly repeated basics; one hundred of this punch, one hundred of this kick. For those it was hard to keep up the one hundred percent effort that I was determined to put into my taijutsu. Mentally, motivating myself for it was the hardest part. I'd probably never be a taijutsu master, but I didn't want to be crippled by poor fighting skills or stamina.</p><p>Of course, my effort had the surprising side effect of motivating the other girls. I guess it was easy for girls like Sakura and Ino, who had high academic scores, to slack off when the highest placed Kunoichi in physical scores was Hinata at only slightly higher than the class middle. She was better than that technically, but lacked the aggression to truly compete. Added that Jyuuken strikes were generally forbidden, she was at a serious disadvantage. But no one likes being overshadowed or dropped on their ass repeatedly, and they were genuinely motivated to show me up. Or at least, get me to stop kicking their asses.</p><p>On days when Jyuuken was allowed, Hinata was the worst opponent for me to face. Even though she could only use those attacks from her hands at this age, they limited the areas that I could strike. The hands have a large range, and can move very quickly. The only area that was really free from their range was below the knee, and even that was compensated for by some of the lower stances. Fighting Hinata like that, more than any of the others, forced me to think ahead. The only strike I could inflict without danger was a leg sweep, and even that put me in grabbing range. I was forced to feint and circle and dodge every strike. To some degree, I did this with the others, anticipating where and how they would strike, how I could retaliate, how to maneuver them into the best position to me. It was interesting to experiment.</p><p>But it was fighting with Hinata that made me resolve to look up counters to the Jyuuken. Either emitted chakra to serve as a shield, or perhaps harnessing my own shadow to take those strikes. Jyuuken <em> hurt. </em> The intrusion of foreign chakra into my system, forcefully, violently, was excruciating. It was like being stabbed and burnt and frozen and electrocuted all at once. The first time we fought I was incapacitated by a mere glancing blow. I built up very, very little tolerance to it at all.</p><p>Whenever we fought, most of the class would cheer for her. My habit of beating people swiftly made me an unpopular opponent, and everyone was more than willing to encourage her to beat me. I didn't begrudge her that because she was a genuinely nice girl, if very shy, and that was something I could sympathise with. She was always willing to unblock my tenketsu afterwards, shyly apologising, regardless of which of us won.</p><p>It was during my second year that I caught my first, and only, glimpse of Itachi Uchiha. I knew Sasuke quite well, being in his class, but Itachi had slipped my mind. That happened. It was hard to remember the exact details from something that had been only a very small part of my life. Even details as important as this.</p><p>"This is my Itachi-nii," Sasuke said, introducing the older boy who had shown up to pick him up from school. Usually his mother came, but not today. He sounded so proud, so adoring of his brother. My heart twisted in guilt, knowing, knowing, that soon he'd be broken and shattered.</p><p>"Hi," I said, barely loud enough to be heard, staring at my feet. Itachi, already a jounin, already an ANBU. Willing to sacrifice <em> everything</em> for his brother and the village. What would he do if he knew what I knew?</p><p>I couldn't even contemplate it. I was too selfish. I <em> knew</em> I wouldn't interfere. I would let these horrible and despicable things happen, because they didn't touch me. Didn't touch my family and my safe little world.</p><p>As much as I told myself 'there is nothing I can do' I knew that at heart I was just a selfish coward.</p><p>Shortly after that we turned seven and the Uchiha clan lay broken. The whole of Konoha was in a sombre, shaken mood. Whatever claims of oppression and hatred Madara made, they weren't noticeable now. These were people that had lost friends, neighbours, comrades - these were people in mourning.</p><p>Sasuke didn't return to school for several weeks. When he did he was pale and wild eyed, snappy and sullen. He avoided everyone and at lunch chose a spot well away from everyone else. He was sitting, back to a tree at the side of the field. It was as isolated as he could get, considering that only final year students were allowed to leave the grounds at break time. A group of girls (including Ino and Sakura) were sitting close by, casting him looks and chattering. Either they had already been repulsed, or they lacked the courage to approach him.</p><p>I watched him go and tugged on Shika's arm. He was damn good at interpreting what I meant. It should have been scary, but it was just relieving that I didn't have to verbalise it. I wasn't sure what I would have said, in any case.</p><p>"Troublesome," Shikamaru said, but adjusted our course. Chouji, bless him, followed without comment.</p><p>We sat without a word.</p><p>Sasuke tensed and glared, angry and upset and grieving. I had no doubt that he could be fairly viscous. "What do you think you're doing?" He hissed.</p><p>I flinched, but Shikamaru just yawned. "Sitting, eating lunch," he said.</p><p>"Well, sit somewhere else! I'm here!"</p><p>"You can come sit with us, Sasuke-kun!" Ino piped up eagerly from nearby.</p><p>He cast them a <em> look</em> , half anger, half disgust.</p><p>"Are you going to Suzume-sensei's class tonight, Ino?" I asked, thinking it time to intervene. I didn't think we should push too much. There was a very large difference between trying to include Sasuke and bothering him.</p><p>Of course Ino was going, she never missed a class, but she took the comment in the spirit it was given, as a conversation starter, and began to chat happily with me about our lessons. After a brief moment, Sakura joined in, followed by some of the other girls, while Chouji and Shika peacefully ate lunch behind us. Sasuke was alone but not excluded. He was a part of the group without being bothered. Maybe we could head off his loner tendencies.</p><p>I don't know if it helped, but it was something. And if I was doing it to assuage the guilt in my heart… well, that was my own business.</p><p>And, at seven, we were deemed ready to begin training in our family Art. Nara believe in contingency plans. Every person in the clan, be they ninja or civilian knows at least the theory of the Shadow Possession Jutsu. That way, if something happened to the clan, there would be <em> someone</em> to pass that knowledge on. They may not have expected me to learn it, but I was still taught.</p><p>And this was my chance to prove that I could.</p><p>Learning to infuse object with your chakra is reasonably easy, learning to do it without damaging them is harder, and to infuse an object that has no physical mass, a shadow, harder still. Managing that, then manipulating it… that's the true difficulty. Our clan style isn't a bloodline, but we do have an affinity towards shadow that mimics an elemental affinity. Other people could learn it, but it would take double, triple maybe quadruple the amount of time and they would never be as efficient nor as effective at it as us. Given that many of our jutsu are fairly limited, and support types, it's not hard to see why no body bothers.</p><p>Of course, there is far more to the Art that any one ever sees.</p><p>I spent a fair bit of time practicing the Shadow Possession Jutsu after dad had shown it to us, and we had mastered the basic steps. It took us several months to progress onto creating and maintaining a 'chakra infused shadow' and from there we had to begin the tedious process of learning how to manipulate it. It had once been known as the Shadow Paralysis Jutsu, but not so long ago, it had been reinvented to control the victims movements instead of just paralysing them. No one says so, but I'm fairly certain the innovation was dads.</p><p>I wanted to be good at it. I practiced the speed of initiation, my hand seals, speed of capture and release, the length I could stretch my shadow, the number of times I could split it, the shape and direction of movement… There were so many parts to it that needed to be perfected.</p><p>I couldn't hold it for long, however. It was an incredibly intensive technique. Chunin level skill is to be able to hold it for five minutes - at this stage I was lucky to be able to hold it for five seconds. That was something I couldn't really change. I could perfect my control over it to reduce my chakra wastage, and do what I could to improve my reserves, but until I was older, they wouldn't grow very much at all.</p><p>And until we had the Shadow Possession Jutsu mastered, the other family techniques were out of our range. Even the next simplest techniques were many times more difficult and exhausting.</p><p>But apart from my desire to <em> learn</em> and my fascination with all things chakra (which still seemed so magical, no matter how many scientific explanations I read) there was no real pressing need to master it. Most of the time, the impending future slipped my mind, inevitable but ignored like an exam I hadn't studied for. I was trying, and I was training, but single minded dedication had never suited me.</p><p>Indeed, Shikamaru barely bothered to learn it before ceasing practice and returning to cloud watching. He too knew he probably should, but didn't have the motivation when there was no immediacy to it. Unlike me, he <em> didn</em> <em> '</em> <em> t</em> know the specifics of the looping future, and still held hope that he would be an average ninja, do an average amount of missions and face an average amount of danger.</p><p>I pestered him into practising with me as much as I could, but I still feared it wouldn't be enough. Shikamaru, for all his smarts, had been so lucky to survive.</p><p>And he was smart. Insanely so.</p><p>By nine it was incredibly clear that my assumptions about being as smart as Shikamaru had been incredibly, incredibly arrogant. I wasn't even close. Not even with a twenty year head start. It was a little humbling. I don't know if any one else saw it, because I was more motivated, I was constantly reading because I liked learning new things, but I knew, and our parents knew.</p><p>Tactics wise, he beat me at every turn. Oh, I made him work for it, but he beat me all the same. Games of Shogi turned into gruelling hour long contests of wills. It could have very easily lead to things getting nasty between us. I found, much to my chagrin, that I had become decidedly unused to losing. The anger and resentment, once I noticed them, made me distinctly uncomfortable with myself. They were not good emotions to be feeling. It was, after all, just a game. One that I was playing with my <em> brother</em> . It should have been fun.</p><p>I resolved very quickly that it was going to be. I was going to take a step back, I was going to <em> breathe</em> and I was going to calm the hell down. I wasn't going to get angry at loosing. I was going to see what he'd done better than me, and how I could use it. I was going to treat it as a lesson, not as a failure.</p><p>After all, I could still learn. I could still improve. I didn't want to be the kind of person that made everything a life or death issue. There was going to be enough of that soon enough.</p><p>Graduation came far too soon. And brought with it a whole suite of problems that I hadn't anticipated.</p><p>"If we assume that teams will be assigned using the 'one kunoichi' method, you are going to be paired with Ino and Chouji," I said to Shikamaru. He kept staring at the clouds. It was likely that he had already reached that conclusion long before. It was practically a given. That wasn't what I wanted to talk about though, that was just a conversation opener, towards the question I couldn't ask - what will happen to me?</p><p>I didn't think anything would break up the Ino-Shika-Cho grouping, and putting more than one Kunoichi on a team generally lead to a weaker, less stable team (or so was the official line. I wasn't quite sure I believed it.) For the same reason, I was almost sure that Hinata, Shino and Kiba would be teamed together. Their combination of abilities complimented each other nicely, for tracking, search and rescue, or non-lethal capture missions.</p><p>Which left me dreading team assignment. I was friends with Naruto, and friendly with Sasuke, and the top ranked kunoichi but I didn't particularly want to be on Team 7. Not with all the trouble that they would attract.</p><p><em> Shoulda thought of that before scoring 100% on all those tests.</em></p><p>I had never purposefully done less than my best before, so it was hard to think I should have now. On the other hand, I didn't really know many of the others. I was semi-friendly with a few, and sure I could have dragged them to a team pass but none stood out as anything special. Not like the Rookie 9.</p><p><em> What about Sakura?</em> I wondered. If I was placed on Team 7, what would happen to her? The answer was obvious. She wasn't quite the friendless fan girl she had been in the anime, but she still lacked… ambition, drive, realism, even common sense sometimes. She would fail. Guilt gnawed the pit of my stomach.</p><p><em> Shoulda damn well thought ahead. </em></p><p>Something so central to a ninja's life should have occurred to me ahead of time. But even if it had, I wasn't sure what I would have done about it.</p><p><hr /></p><p>AN: while there is a martial art called Shorin-ryu, and it does mean the 'small forest style', I have no idea what it's like and it most definitely isn't as portrayed above. I just liked the name.</p><p>FFNet. Why are you not uploading things properly? Have they changed you <em> again</em> ?</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert</p><p>Author's Notes: One of my reviewers kindly pointed out that I've fallen into the classic 'show; don't tell' trap - in that I'm not doing so. I'm trying my best, but I'm not sure if thats going to change overly very soon.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 4</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The indispensable first step to getting what you want out of life is this; decide what you want ~ Ben Stein</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Graduation day was approaching and it felt like my life was sliding out of control. Which was funny, I probably had more control over what I was doing and where I was going than the last time I was twelve. Then again, I hadn't been expected to make life changing decisions last time.</p><p>It probably came from knowing what was coming, and being unable to stop it. The future is an unstoppable force and having a countdown only makes it worse. War is coming. Madara is coming.</p><p>What the hell was I going to do?</p><p>I could fail the graduation test. It would be hard, but do-able. My test marks were near perfect for the entire time I had been at the Academy, but I could make mistakes, act as though the pressure got to me. I could throw the test without anyone knowing a thing.</p><p>But then I would never be a ninja. No one wanted a ninja who buckled under pressure.</p><p>It's hard to describe what it was like. Ninja were respected, of course, almost revered in some cases. Even the lowest of genin had standing beyond that of a civilian. Ninja, or clans, with skills could become quite wealthy and that was a draw too. But there was more to it than that. It was almost a sense of patriotism. Ninja <em> contributed</em> to Konoha. It was both a duty and a honour, concepts which had been foreign to me, but had quickly rooted themselves in my soul. I didn't know any jobs in my home-world that compared. Maybe a hundred years ago that was what it was like to be a soldier, but I had known nothing like it.</p><p>There was expectation. Children were expected to try to, to <em> want </em> to, become ninja. To have the skills and <em> not</em> was nearly unthinkable.</p><p>That was why Shikamaru was willing to entertain the idea of work. Why Ino, who would rather run the flowershop, and Sakura, who was so self-conscious of her appearance, were training to become killers.</p><p>That, I reflected wryly, was social conditioning at its finest.</p><p>The idea of failing the test was considered and, ultimately, rejected. Regardless of <em> why</em> I felt like that, I did. Konoha, for all my memories, was my home and I loved it as much as any other - social conditioning or not. I couldn't deliberately fail the exam.</p><p>I could however, request transfer to the Medic Corps immediately. Ninja in Konoha were divided into three basic sections. ANBU, Medic Corp, and General Operations. ANBU recruited members from the other two sectors and answered only to the Hokage, I didn't know much about their internal structure, nobody did, but it was assumed they were run in small teams led by a Captain. The Medic Corps were divided into two 'sections', the field medics, and the hospital medics, or rather, those that went on missions, and those that didn't. The former were usually recruited from the General Operations, as they had to have some field abilities, while the later could be anyone with the ability to use healing chakra, civilians, academy students, and there were even several clans that focused solely on their healing skills and never produced a field ready shinobi. General Operations was the largest of the three sections, and contained all active duty shinobi. Of course, shinobi never really retired, but there were those that stopped requesting missions, like my mother. Entry into General Operations happened in two ways, the Jounin Squads, which we would be tested for after graduation, and the Genin Corps. If you failed the Jounin test, you went to the Genin Corps and your chances of rising above genin were very low indeed. The Jounin Squads took the budding geniuses, the politically sensitive, the important and those students with the extra <em> something</em> that made people think they might succeed.</p><p>Aunt Igaku had already promised to sponsor me into the Medic Corps if I wanted to. She was a Chief Surgeon at the hospital so her word held a lot of weight there. So did the name Nara, so I was highly unlikely to be rejected.</p><p>Still, training for the Medic Corps was three years, five if I wanted to be a field medic, and I would never be more than a support. Field medics didn't fight, they just followed closely and picked up the pieces. If you were really good, you might get recruited into ANBU and retrained to fight, but only if you were really good.</p><p>It wasn't that I wanted to <em> fight</em> exactly. But I wanted to be more than a bystander. I didn't want to be helpless to <em> help</em> .</p><p>The Genin Corps were out. As a Nara, more specifically, as daughter of the clan head, I would never be put there.</p><p>Which left… passing the graduation exam, passing the Jounin Test… and, likely, taking Sakura's spot on Team 7.</p><p>I was of two minds about that. On one hand, it was wrong. That was Sakura's spot and I hated to deprive her of it. She deserved the chance to grow into a kick-ass kunoichi. And Team 7 was a trouble magnet. It would be a damn dangerous assignment. I'd certainly have to step up my skills to survive.</p><p>Which, in its own way, was a little thrilling. The closer I was, the more I could influence. The more I could <em> change</em> . Regardless of what team I was placed on, I was sure I wouldn't be with Shikamaru. It would be nice to have team mates I knew and could trust. And, selfishly, maybe I could stop Sasuke. That was a major point, after all.</p><p>Could I do it? Not just mentally, but physically. Did I have the skills?</p><p>I was well ahead of the rest of my class. So far ahead that there had been talk of graduating me early - which had then been rejected on the basis of my confidence or lack there-of. That had nearly scared me into hiding, but I wasn't good enough to <em> not </em> be good. It took far more skill to pretend to be bad while being good than I had.</p><p>But ultimately, measuring myself against Academy students was worthless. I needed to be much, much stronger than that. The target I had set myself was so far ahead as to feel impossible at times.</p><p>Realistically, what was my skill level?</p><p>I could do the three academy jutsu, the shadow possession jutsu and two minor earth jutsu - earth wall and earth spike.</p><p>Konoha was unique in that it had such a mix of elemental affinities. The Uchiha, the original clan of the Land of Fire, took after their namesake, but the Senju had had a mix of earth and water (which together formed the First Hokage's Wood Release), and the clans that they had invited in reflected this. Lighting was uncommon but not rare, while wind type was currently restricted to the Sarutobi family.</p><p>Frankly, earth was the best element combination that I could have had. Fire and lightning would have destroyed the shadows that I needed for the Nara clan style while wind and water would have been useful, but earth was the only one that would <em> cast</em> shadows.</p><p>Mum was a genjutsu type. Or rather, a mixed gen-nin type. She had an earth element affinity and knew quite a few nasty jutsu to take down an enemy while they were distracted with her genjutsu.</p><p>Genjutsu don't cast shadows. That's one of the details that can give away a poorly formed genjutsu. They don't alter the light that flows through them. Even area of effect genjutsu don't actually exist. They're disruptions of the chakra system that make you see them, hear them, feel them, when in reality, there is nothing physically there.</p><p>She had taught me a few set genjutsu, as well as the basic pattern for creating them. I had the chakra control necessary for it, but not the imagination. I could see a definite use for genjutsu in hiding or distracting, but I doubted I would ever be good enough to simply rely on it. I would probably never use it as more than a cover or a feint.</p><p>Other than that, I had decent enough chakra control to tree walk, water walk, form chakra strings, my chakra sense was extremely sensitive and I was accurate with my thrown weapons. I was aggressive with my taijutsu, but wouldn't bet on myself against anyone larger or more experienced than me. Not unless they had deeply underestimated me.</p><p>My trap making skills weren't anything to sneeze at, but that was not often a combat ability. You needed time for traps, and that wasn't something you often had.</p><p>Of course, jutsu weren't the be all and end all of ninja existence. There was a reason that only three jutsu were taught in the Academy and none of them were offensive. Some ninja went their entire careers without ever encountering a single enemy nin in combat. Even the most recently graduated Genin was good enough to take down bandits and hired thugs.</p><p>It was just unlucky that Team 7, Rookie 9, Konoha 12 were about to be caught up in battles far beyond normal.</p><p>And regardless of how much I knew, I had never had call to use any of it in combat. What would my reactions be? Could I keep up?</p><p>I had a sinking feeling that whatever my current strength, it was no where near enough.</p><p>And that thought alone brought a bubble of panic to my chest. It was one thing to think 'in future, in future', it was another to think 'in three years'. Six months till the Chunin exams, three years for the time skip, that was all we had.</p><p>I swallowed. Hard. Three years? Where had all the time gone. That wasn't enough.</p><p><em> That wasn't long enough.</em></p><p>I sat the graduation test, vibrating with nerves. I passed with flying colours, giving Iruka-sensei a tremulous smile when he presented me with a shiny new head band engraved with the Konoha leaf.</p><p>"Congratulations," he said warmly. I think that may have been the proudest moment of my life, snuffing out, for a moment, all my doubts and miss-givings.</p><p>Naruto… didn't pass. I worried before remembering… there was something, wasn't there? A second test he had sat? It had been when he had learnt the Shadow Clone jutsu. I cursed my failing memory. This was important. These little tidbits of knowledge could make all the difference in the world.</p><p>I tried to seek him out after class, but he was gone, and mum and dad were waiting for us, faces proud at our induction to the ninja ranks. Reluctantly, I turned from my search to present my achievement to them. I don't think they ever considered that we could fail. Not at this.</p><p>"Well done, my little shadows," Dad said, tilting his face back into the sunshine as mum hugged us. "Well done."</p><p>That night our peaceful celebration was broken by alarms going off in the centre of Konoha. Dad stood from dinner, grim faced, and left to answer the summons as Jounin Commander. The three of us geared up, but didn't leave the house. The alarm would change if Chunin and Genin were required. So far, it was only calling for ANBU and Jounin.</p><p>Konoha had an intricate system of alarms, some loud, some quiet, some silent. There were signal hawks and personal messenger pigeons. There were always messenger nin running around the village. The alarm system was coded for everything from invasion to disease outbreak to escaped dogs, and I remember being drilled in the different codes as soon as I could talk.</p><p>Tonight, the code said something like <em> High Priority. Jounin, ANBU respond. Hokage Tower. Politically sensitive. All ninja high alert. Prepare for evacuation and rapid deployment.</em></p><p>Mums hands were white knuckled on the table. She still trained. She had been a chunin, I knew that much, and likely a reasonably good one. Though I remembered from Before that she had never returned to service, it was possible that she hadn't made that decision yet, and still intended to resume her role once my brother and I were old enough. There was no reason she shouldn't. We had a wide support base, and plenty of people to look after us if she was away. It was her career after all, and I wondered if she was unhappy in the role of housewife. I never seemed that way, but she was a ninja afterall, as well as a mother, and neither of those liked to admit to unhappiness in front of their children. She hid it well but I think she was terrified we would be called out on our first night as ninja. We might not have passed the Jounin Test yet, but we had our headbands. We were ninja and if something was attacking the village, we would be honour bound to respond.</p><p>We held silent vigil for several hours before the alarms died down to <em> Mission accomplished. All ninja return to normal status.</em></p><p>Mum sighed. "Well, that was too much excitement for one night," she said, ignoring the fact that we had done nothing more than wait. "Your dad probably wont be home for hours yet. You ought to go off to bed."</p><p>We didn't protest, nerves stretched thin and jangled. Village alarms had gone off before, but being expected to respond gave them a new feeling of weight. I wasn't sure I liked it.</p><p>I dreamt of Kyuubi and in his great and fearsome eye was the spinning of the Sharingan. Around him, all the world burnt.</p><p><em> Too much tension</em> , I diagnosed, as I ran through my morning Kata in the backyard. <em> Too much thinking about things I can't change and am not ready to face. I need to break it down. Small steps, that's the key.</em></p><p>We had a week until team placement. That was time to fill out our ninja registration and get our ID photos done, allowing, of course, additional time for the bureaucracy to process it. Other than that, we had no duties as ninja, and my clan duties wouldn't take up much time.</p><p>Therefore it was past time to make a plan.</p><p>I needed to get stronger. Experience would only come with time; there was nothing I could do to change that. But I could improve my knowledge. I could study the clan style, master the Shadow Possession and move on to more difficult techniques. There were <em> many</em> of them. I could find ways to increase the effectiveness of the ones I knew; typically we used flares and explosive tags rigged to give only light but there would be other ways. There were always other ways.</p><p>I could practice my earth jutsu, and get mum to teach me more. Having more options was never a bad thing, as long as I could reliably use them. Speed, being able to do a jutsu quickly, was going to be a good thing.</p><p>I wanted to learn at least a basic healing jutsu. Going on missions would be dangerous and it would make mistakes a little more forgiving. I'd already decided that I didn't want to be a medic-nin, but part of what we worked on in the clan wasn't just healing, it was stimulants, strength boosts. <em> That</em> was something that would come in handy.</p><p>And if we were talking about medics and strength, I certainly wanted to try and reinvent Tsunade's strength technique. It seemed a shortcut to enhancing my own relatively weak frame.</p><p>I certainly wanted to continue learning seals. So far all I could manage were exploding tags of various types and sealing scrolls. Useful but my ultimate goal was much larger. I wanted to created a chakra storage seal to bolster my own meagre capacity.</p><p>I certainly wanted to figure out if the ambient chakra I could sense in the air was sage chakra or merely residual emitted chakra. If I could tap that, it would go a long way towards increasing the length of time I could hold a jutsu. I had no idea how to do that, though. I knew Naruto had become a Sage through the Toad contract, but were they the only ones that knew how? Would other summons know? Or perhaps monks or priests? There was nothing in the clan library at the levels I had access to, but maybe there was more at the Genin or Chunin levels, even the restricted Jounin section. In a few days I'd be able to access the former, and Chunin within a year or two. If that failed, I could always get a summon contract and ask.</p><p>I wound down my Kata and nodded firmly to myself. It was a plan, however shaky. Having a plan always made me feel a little better.</p><p>Of course, a far more short term plan would be to drag Shikamaru to the Hokage Tower, complete our ninja registration and then go and see if Naruto was involved in the commotion last night like I thought he was.</p><p>Shikamaru was eager to escape the house when mum started suggesting he could spend his free time working with the deer - or as eager as Shika could be, which meant he didn't complain when I asked him to come with me.</p><p>We brought dango on the way to the Tower, got our ID photos taken and spent the morning filling out far too many sheets of paperwork.</p><p>"Troublesome," Shikamaru muttered as he slumped over the last, finally, completed form. I tugged it out from under his arm, checked it over, and clipped it neatly to the pile.</p><p>"Done!" I said brightly, standing from the small desk in the registration office that was set aside for paperwork completion. All around me, new genin were busily filling out their own forms.</p><p>"Nara, Shikako," I said to the nin behind the registration desk, handing the forms over. "Zero-One-Two-Six-One-Oh and Nara, Shikamaru, Zero-One-Two-Six-One-One."</p><p>He glanced at the photos, flicked through the pages and looked up at me, then towards Shika who was slouching behind me. "It all looks to be in place. Thank you for filing it promptly."</p><p>We left, glad to leave the stuffy room. It hadn't been difficult to fill out, just tedious.</p><p>"Lunch?" Shika suggested, yawning.</p><p>I 'hmmm'ed in agreement. "Then… do you want to find Naruto?" I asked quietly. I really did want to check that he was okay, though it was usually him that sought us out.</p><p>Shikamaru just nodded, not betraying any indication that it was unusual. I loved that about him, that he never called me out on my whims or looked at me like I was acting oddly.</p><p>Naruto was more difficult to find that expected. He wasn't at his house or Ichiraku Ramen, which were the first places we checked.</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>Although the exact numbers are classified, Konoha has around thirty thousand shinobi. The average shinobi took only around ten missions a year. Even if some missions took weeks, that still left a large amount of down time. Most of that was spent training. As such, Konoha had a large amount of resources dedicated to keeping ninja skills sharp. There were training fields of all types and descriptions. There were dojo's. There were kunai ranges. There were obstacle courses. Then there was the library. There were study room. There were sections of scrolls on nearly every topic. There were librarians well versed in many technical arts all on staff to help ninja puzzle out the nitty gritty of a specific technique or skill.</p><p>Which meant, trying to find a shinobi in Konoha was almost akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack. I didn't have very much range on my chakra sense; enough to tell who was in attacking distance and little more. There were ways to narrow the search down, some places were off limits to Genin, some Naruto was frankly unlikely to go anyway, but that still left a huge amount of space to cover.</p><p>It was well past lunch time by the time we found him in one of the more out of the way training fields. It was little more than a clearing only a short distance from the Hokage Tower, but it was seldom used.</p><p>"Shikako? Shikamaru? What are you guys doing here?" Naruto blinked curiously, bouncing to his feet.</p><p>"Looking for you," I answered quietly, taking him in. He looked happy and cheerful, if a bit dirty. But yes, wrapped around his forehead, where his goggles usually rested, was a slightly battered forehead protector.</p><p>Shikamaru saw it too. "Where did you get that? I thought you failed the graduation test," he drawled.</p><p>"Hehe," Naruto chuckled nervously, scratching the back of his neck. "Well, Mizuki-sensei told me there was a second test, but there wasn't really, and then Iruka-sensei came and he was <em> awesome</em> and then I fought Mizuki and then Iruka-sensei gave me his headband!" His voice rose in volume and pitch as he got more and more excited telling his story.</p><p>I blinked at Shikamaru. That cleared… nothing up.</p><p>"Mizuki-sensei told you there was a second test?" I repeated, trying to get Naruto to clarify. He was always willing to talk, sometime <em> too </em> willing, but getting a story in a logical sequence sometimes involved asking a lot of pointed questions.</p><p>Naruto scowled. "He tricked me!" he claimed. "He said that if I got a scroll from the old mans office, and learnt a jutsu off it, he'd pass me. I did it and everything." He brightened. "Hey! Do you want to see my new awesome jutsu? It's called the Shadow Clone and it's way, waaaay better than that lame clone that we learnt at the Academy."</p><p>He didn't wait for a reply, and with a single cross hand seal (which wasn't even a real hand seal) there was a puff of smoke and three Naruto standing where before there had been only one.</p><p>"And they're real and everything," he claimed. "I used them to beat Mizuki up after he said -" he cut himself off. "Stuff. He said stuff. But then Iruka-sensei was like 'he's my student' and got hurt so I had to fight back and I made like, a thousand clones and Mizuki didn't stand a chance."</p><p>I poked one of the clones, confirming that yes, they were solid. So that was where Naruto had learnt that jutsu. I accepted that I could barely remember any real hard facts from before, but this had been his signature jutsu and was kinda important, plot wise.</p><p>"Cool," Shikamaru said, leaning back to look at the clouds. He looked very disinterested now that he'd solved the problem we came here for, but I could tell his brain was still buzzing.</p><p>Admitedly, an all Jounin and ANBU high priority alert seemed to be a reaction incredibly out of proportion to the situation.</p><p>"And you didn't get into trouble?" I asked tentatively.</p><p>"Nah," Naruto shook his head. "The old man said… I should be able to trust my sensei." He looked down and scuffed his feet. "But that I should try and think about the orders I get given, otherwise I might end up doing something I don't like."</p><p>"Good advice," Shikamaru agreed.</p><p>Naruto snorted. "Hmph, you're just saying that because it means you wouldn't have to do what people told you, you lazy ass."</p><p>I giggled even though it wasn't true. Shikamaru, at this age, was no more suspicious of his teachers than Naruto. Even learning second hand of what had happened, he was a little shaken up. You <em> should</em> be able to trust your teachers, but that didn't mean you <em> could</em> . Of course, we were trained to follow orders without complaint. It was a very thin line to walk.</p><p>"So are you ready for team assignments then?" I asked.</p><p>Naruto grinned. "Oh yeah! I hope I'm on a team with Sakura-chan. That would be awesome!" Honourifics were strange things. We all used them, but I barely even registered them anymore, unless they were emphasised for some reason or another. Naruto's obnoxious crush on Sakura counted. Then again, it wasn't like Sakura's crush on Sasuke was any better. She and Ino had nearly broken their friendship up over it. I had been unamused and refused to split myself between them.</p><p>I hummed. It was too late now to try and influence the team arrangements, even if I had been able to decide what to do. I simply had to wait, just like everyone else. It was an edge of nervousness that carried me through the week until we were seated in the classroom for the last time.</p><p>"Congratulations, graduates," Iruka said formally. He looked a little battered but it clearly wasn't serious any longer. "Starting today, you are all Shinobi of Konoha. But the journey that lies ahead for you has only just begun. As genin, you will all be assigned to a three-man squad, led by a Jounin instructor. In order to successfully complete your missions, you <em> will</em> need to follow your sensei's instructions." He sent a particularly hard look into several areas of the room.</p><p>"Team one will be Yobirin Suzu, Sakura Haruno and Jiro Wantanabe," he began.</p><p>I cast a guilty look at Sakura. Unless they got a medic nin for a sensei (unlikely) that team was doomed to fail unless they got a miracle. It <em> could</em> happen.</p><p>"… seven is Sasuke Uchiha, Naruto Uzumaki and Shikako Nara," Iruka continued, and my attention snapped back to him. Naruto booed at Sasuke, then cheered, looking like he wanted to jump over the test and tackle-hug me. I gave him a weak smile. "Team eight is Hinata Hyuuga…"</p><p>Team eight was what I expected, and Team ten was the reformation of the famous Ino-Shika-Cho.</p><p>"Alright. Your Jounin instructors will meet you here after lunch." He smiled. "Good luck."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 5</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success. ~ Henry Ford</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Iruka-sensei dismissed us for what was, in all actuality, a very long lunch break seeing as how we had only come to the Academy for team assignments anyway. I think it may have been a subtle way of saying 'bow to the whims of your superiors, no matter how nonsensical'. He had said 'get to know your team mates' but we'd all been in the same classes for the past seven years; it wasn't like we didn't know each other. Then again, given the Naruto-Sasuke combination, that didn't necessarily equate to being friends.</p><p>"Umm, did you want to eat lunch together?" I asked softly. "I have extra lunch." Mum had made extra lunch for the sole purpose of sharing with our team mates. Nothing quite breaks the ice like free food.</p><p>Naruto lit up like Christmas had come early. "Awesome! Your mum makes the best bento! Hey, why don't we go find Shikamaru? He's on Chouji's team, right?" He grabbed my arm and started dragging. Given that's how I usually get Shika to move, I acknowledged the irony.</p><p>"Sasuke?" I queried, sticking my feet to the floor against Naruto's tugging. He clearly didn't intend to come with us. "Will you please come?"</p><p>I could see the 'don't get in my way' written on his face. He clearly didn't like being put on a three person team, and certainly not with Naruto. I found it interesting that he didn't seem to have expected the teams.</p><p>Now that I thought about it… it wasn't something that had been covered in the Academy <em> explicitly</em> . It was just… there. Implicit in everything; ninja work in teams. Something you just <em> knew</em> from family, from stories. It wasn't something that you got told.</p><p>Which left a lot of people out in the cold, civilian kids, orphans… they'd have no idea of the 'unspoken rules'. I hadn't even realised there were any.</p><p>Naruto groaned. "Aww, why do you want him to come for? It's bad enough he has to be on <em> our</em> team… hey, do you think Iruka-sensei would let us swap him? Maybe for Sakura-chan, yeah, that'd be great!"</p><p>Sasuke scowled. "Fine," he bit out, probably just out of spite.</p><p>I felt like sighing and let Naruto drag me outside. Trying to keep the peace between these two was going to cause a headache and a half. And that isn't even mentioning trying to get them to work together.</p><p>Lunch was trying. Finding Shika also meant finding Ino, who spent the entire time fussing over Sasuke, who got increasingly irritated and sniped at Naruto. Naruto shouted back. It was hardly a calming, relaxing 'getting to know you'.</p><p>Hmm. It might have been cleverer to <em> reduce</em> the amount of time we spent together to avoid getting on each others nerves. Then, again, I suspected we would have plenty of time after lunch to annoy each other as well.</p><p>We went back to class and the other teams were collected one by one. Asuma Sarutobi collected team ten, looking completely unbothered, and Kurenai Yuhi, looking neatly professional, escorted team eight out of the classroom. A jounin I didn't recognise took Sakura with team one. Then it was just us. Iruka-sensei looked flustered and checked his watch.</p><p>"I've got to be at the mission desk in ten minutes. You'll be alright waiting for your Jounin-sensei?" he asked.</p><p>We assured him we would. Or rather, Sasuke grunted, I nodded and Naruto chattered loudly about how there was nothing that he couldn't do.</p><p>I'd brought a book with me, as I did very nearly every day. It was a thick and heavy text book on Metabolic Biochemistry. Chemistry had never been my forte, but everything was subtly different here, with the inclusion of chakra cycles. Chakra wasn't stored as ATP as the rest of energy in the body was, it was … well, no one actually knew. It manifested mostly as light, so it was hypothesised to be stored as electromagnetic or some other waveform energy, but that was starting to get into physics beyond my understanding.</p><p>Sasuke was, of course, capable of waiting patiently, even if it was with bad grace. Naruto, however, was bored long before Iruka left, and without the commanding glare of his teacher, started investigating the class room. He opened draws and cupboards, peered behind shelves, and leaned so far out the window he nearly fell out. The teachers knew better than to leave anything in the classrooms, and there wasn't really enough there to keep him entertained.</p><p>I thought about suggesting he read a book, but rejected the idea. I certainly didn't have anything that he would be interested in, and it was doubtful he'd brought anything with him.</p><p><em> Then again,</em> I thought watching him prop the blackboard eraser on top of the door, <em> it's not like he's destroying the room</em> .</p><p>Sasuke snorted in disgust. "No half decent Jounin is going to fall for that." It was clear he was bored and itching for a fight.</p><p>I felt a … shiver in the air. The amount of ambient chakra just increased, as though someone had used a jutsu.</p><p><em> What-?</em></p><p>There was someone in the corridor. I ignored Sasuke and Naruto arguing and watched the door as it slid open, the eraser falling to land perfectly on a mop of white hair.</p><p>There was an instant of silence.</p><p>"Bwahahaha," Naruto howled. "You fell for it! I can't believe it! Take that Sasuke. I am the prank master!"</p><p>Kakashi looked… harmless. A bit silly, a bit eccentric, like a harmless old man. I caught myself writing him off as no threat. I was impressed. I <em> knew</em> that he was one of the best ninja in Konoha, that he had the Sharingan and would unlock the Magenkyo. I knew he had made Jounin at thirteen, which is impressive any way you look at it. And I still nearly wrote him off as harmless.</p><p>That was impressive.</p><p>I didn't have much hard data on Kakashi. What I knew was mostly hazy memories from so long ago. Although I definitely had an information network in Ino, our social circles didn't overlap with Jounin at all. Our <em> teachers</em> social circles didn't overlap with Jounin at all. The most I had was some throwaway lines from dad, some unconfirmed rumours of varying quality and a single bingo book page from Cloud.</p><p>Bingo book pages are odd things. Originally, they started as a way to keep track of missing-nin from your own village. Then they expanded to missing-nin of other villages. Then shinobi of extreme skill made their way onto those pages, more as a warning than as a target. Any ninja listed in a bingo book who is still affiliated with their village has <em> at least</em> a rank of 'Caution; extreme danger'. The Yellow Flash is famous for being listed as 'Flee on Sight'. Information on bingo book pages is notoriously spotty. In a way, that had been one of the trickiest things for me to learn, coming as I did from a world where information is only the touch of a button away. But information is gold here, and guarded just as well.</p><p>Dad had encouraged us to read the Konoha issue bingo book, and he certainly had purloined copies from every other major nation that he hadn't forbidden us from reading. If he really didn't want us to touch them, we wouldn't have even known they were there.</p><p>Kakashi - Kakashi-sensei, I suppose - had made Genin at five, Chunin at six and Jounin at thirteen. He was the son of Sakumo Hatake, the White Fang of Konoha, and taught by the Fourth Hokage himself. He had the Sharingan eye and was known as the Copy-Nin for his prowess at using it to copy ninjutsu. He was part of ANBU for anywhere between five and ten years, and Captain rank for probably at least half that. He had a lightning element affinity, though could use all five to great effect (which alone made him extremely dangerous) and invented the Chidori/Raikiri and in his hands it was ranked an S-rank One Hit Kill technique.</p><p>All this, I <em> knew</em> . And looking at the man standing in the doorway, I could see no trace of it. Not in his stance, not in his eye, not in his chakra. It was almost like it was a completely different person.</p><p><em> Oh, he is good.</em></p><p>"My first impression," he said flatly. "I don't like you."</p><p>I flinched. <em> Ouch.</em></p><p>"Meet me on the roof in five minutes," he said, vanishing in a puff of chakra smoke. The Body Flicker, high speed movement that looked to the untrained eye like teleportation. There were two versions of it, a shorter less controlled combat version, and the longer version most ninja used for transport. I could manage a straight line combat Body Flicker, but using it as transport meant avoiding obstacles which was very difficult when you were moving faster than the eye could see.</p><p>As it was, five minutes was more than enough time to get to the roof using more mundane methods like taking the stairs.</p><p>"Great," Kakashi-sensei said, perching on the railing as we sat across from him. "Now we can all introduce ourselves." There was a long awkward silence. "You know, likes, dislikes, hobbies, dreams for the future?"</p><p>Sasuke sighed, apparently resigned to going first. "My name is Sasuke Uchiha. I have a lot of dislikes, but it doesn't matter since there is almost nothing I like. My dream for the future… no, my <em> ambition</em> is to revive my clan, and to kill a certain man."</p><p>There was something horrifying about listening to a twelve year old declare intent to murder in a perfectly emotionless tone. And it seemed like I was the only one affected by it.</p><p>"I'm Naruto Uzumaki! What I like is ramen, especially the kind at the Ichiraku Ramen shop. What I dislike is the three minute wait after you pour in the boiling water. My hobbies are eating ramen. And my dream... is to be the next Hokage!" He jumped up, finger pointing to emphasise the greatness of … either the Hokage or ramen. Probably ramen, knowing Naruto.</p><p>"My name is Shikako Nara. I like my family and the deer. I dislike people yelling. My hobbies are reading and … helping out at the clan workshops. My dream…" I hesitated.</p><p>As I gave the basic introduction, my voice was quiet, and trembled just a little. Public speaking of any kind, even in front of only a few people, had always afflicted me with nerves. It was something that I had no control over, something that defied any sort of reasoning. No matter how much I repeated to myself that nothing would happen, that there was nothing scary about talking to people, still my voice would shake.</p><p>The boys probably didn't notice it, but Kakashi-sensei undoubtable did. I wonder what he thought of it; did he think I had low self-esteem, did he think I was shy, did he think anything of it at all?</p><p><em> My dream is to be special.</em> I almost said it, but I looked up at just the wrong moment. Kakashi-sensei looked bored but patient, but the two boys didn't even appear to be paying attention.</p><p>How stupid did that sound?</p><p>"doesn't matter," I finished, quieter than even before.</p><p>"Great," Kakashi-sensei said, clapping his hands together like we hadn't just revealed what a collection of walking neuroses we were. "My name is Kakashi Hatake, my likes and dislikes don't matter and you're too young to know my hobbies. Now that we all know each other, I get to tell you about what we're going to be doing tomorrow."</p><p>"Yeah!" Naruto bounced to his feet. "Are we going on a mission? Do we get to rescue a princess? Or fight enemy ninja? I'm totally ready for it!"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei chuckled darkly. A creeping whisper of chakra wanted me to believe the sky was darkening. I isolated the genjutsu probe and got rid of it with a shudder. It felt like static electricity on my insides.</p><p>"Oh, it's a mission alright," he said ominously. "A survival mission."</p><p>Naruto stopped bouncing, apparently clueing in on the projected atmosphere. "A… survival mission?"</p><p>"You see," sensei said. "even though you've graduated the Academy, you aren't real ninja just yet. Of the twenty seven students who graduated, only nine will go on to be shinobi. You still have to pass <em> my</em> test. The test which has a <em> sixty six percent</em> failure rate."</p><p>He leaned back, looking pleased at Naruto's spluttering and Sasuke's sudden focused expression.</p><p>"Meet me at Training Ground Three at five o'clock tomorrow morning. Training is going to be harsh, so I'd recommend not eating breakfast unless you want to throw it up." Eating right before exercises could lead to problems, but not eating had it's own traps. Besides, its not like ninja could just <em> not eat</em> on missions, which was where small, bland and regular snacks came in at least half an hour before exercise.</p><p>He vanished in another Body Flicker, leaving leaves to litter the roof top.</p><p>I wandered home. Given that we'd wasted three hours waiting for Kakashi-sensei to show up, Shikamaru was long done. Father had an amused smirk on his face and I knew that he knew <em> exactly</em> who our Jounin-sensei was. I wanted to level a dirty scowl at him but didn't - it was hardly his fault.</p><p>"So how did it go?" Mum wanted to know.</p><p>I shrugged. "Okay. We have a test tomorrow. Sensei said we'd probably be doing heavy exercise." I didn't add his recommendation to not eat, mum and dad were both ninja and they knew how to eat for missions. "I'll probably put together a mission pack later. I don't know what we'll be doing."</p><p>"Alright. Let me know if you need any help, okay?" she said.</p><p>I nodded affirmative.</p><p>"A test?" Shikamaru drawled. "What for?"</p><p>I frowned. "You didn't get one? Sensei said most of the graduates would fail and go back to the Academy."</p><p>"It's a Jounin's choice as to whether or not to give the test," Dad explained. "And as to what test to give. Asuma probably didn't think it necessary."</p><p>I snickered. "Or knew that the likelihood of Shika completing it was inversely proportional to the amount of effort involved."</p><p>"A test would have been too troublesome," Shikamaru declared, flopping backwards to stare at the sky. I'm pretty sure he said it as a joke. If he had been given a test, I have no doubt he would have at least given it a try. Then again, with Team Ten, the bell test would have fallen over before it even began. Chouji would never take something that could help someone else, Shika wouldn't care to compete with anyone and Ino had a good heart under her sometimes abrasive exterior. Not to mention, the only way they would be <em> able</em> to take on Asuma would be together.</p><p>Which begged the question of how I was going to get my hodge-podge team to work together.</p><p>The thought tumbled over in my mind as I packed my mission gear. Intense exercise meant I didn't want to be carrying a lot, which was where sealing scrolls came in. They could still get pretty bulky, but a small scroll still stored more than I could comfortably carry otherwise. I couldn't be entirely certain that Kakashi would stick to the same plot as the show, but I very much doubted the test would last longer than a day, so I could leave behind my camping gear. I'd want combat gear, trap setting tools, water bottles, ration bars, a med-kit and probably a book for however long we had to wait for him to show up. I hesitated, then doubled the number of ration bars - I wasn't sure what Sasuke and Naruto would do, but they might have taken Kakashi-sensei's words seriously.</p><p>The fact that he'd given such bad advice made me frown. <em> Can't trust your teacher. You've got to think about the orders you were given or you might end up doing something you don't like.</em></p><p>Apparently some lessons need reinforcing over and over again.</p><p>In the morning, I was at the training fields well before the allotted time. Given that my sensei is Kakashi, its rather perverse I'm pedantically punctual. I arrive early. If others don't show up on time I start to think that I'm in the wrong place. I get rather nervous and agitated. In this instance, I took a walk around the training field. There was a rather large clearing with three posts and the Memorial Stone, bordered by a river and a forest. The forest was pretty much standard Konoha fare - large, widely spaced trees, plenty of shrublike undergrowth, and meandering paths. I made a quick check to see if there were any preset traps - either by sensei or left from other training sessions - but I found nothing. I didn't want to risk setting any of my own before I knew what was happening.</p><p>By the time I'd made it back to the clearing Naruto and Sasuke were both there and ignoring each other. I did a quick chakra sweep but even if sensei had been there I'm pretty sure he could have hid from me, I might have unusual chakra sensitivity but he was a Jounin for a reason.</p><p>"Good morning," I greeted quietly. Sasuke grunted. Naruto yawned. This was not a team of morning people.</p><p>I sat and pulled out my book to start reading.</p><p>"Sooo hungry," Naruto moaned about an hour later.</p><p>I peered over my book. "Didn't you have breakfast?" I asked curiously, suspecting the answer.</p><p>"Are you crazy?" Naruto answered. "Kakashi-sensei said not to or we'd throw it up!"</p><p>I nodded. "Mmm. Its true that if you eat right before exercises you might get sick or stitch. But some missions can last a few weeks, right? So ninja have to be able to eat on missions."</p><p>He stared at me. "That's right! I totally didn't think of that. So how…?"</p><p>"Well," I said. "You should always leave at least half an hour or longer between eating and heavy exercise. And you should eat things that are high in carbohydrates but low in proteins and fats because they take longer to digest. Things like fruits or cereals."</p><p>I noticed Sasuke was also listening. That was good, I didn't like the idea that my team mates didn't know something like this. I pulled my sealing scroll out and unravelled it, locating the symbol that I had stored the ration bars in. With a quick application of chakra, it released a small pile of bars; it was a good thing I had the foresight to bring extra. They were pretty much standard ration bars that any ninja family brought in bulk.</p><p>"Here," I said quietly, dividing out a few bars for each of them. "It's only for today though," I cautioned Naruto. "Next time you'll have to bring your own."</p><p>Sasuke looked like he wanted to refuse them, maybe out of pride, maybe for some other reason. I pushed them in his direction and resealed the rest of them before going back to my book. Common sense and a hungry stomach won out over pride and stubbornness and after a second, he came closer and picked them up.</p><p>It was a very quiet morning as we waited for sensei to show up. That suited me just fine.</p><p>"Good morning!" a cheery voice called several hours later.</p><p>Naruto leapt to his feet. "YOU'RE LATE!" he hollered.</p><p>I flinched away from the explosion of noise. Naruto certainly had a good pair of lungs. I took that as my cue to seal my book away. It was from the clan library and I didn't really want it getting damaged.</p><p>"Well, a black cat crossed my path so I had to take the long way."</p><p>He… actually used excuses like that. I almost couldn't believe it. If he used excuses like that on everyone else-</p><p>I frowned. If he did then what? When you were an elite Jounin you could get away with a hell of a lot, being late included. It wasn't like there was anyone that could call him on it except maybe the Jounin Commander and the Hokage and even then they'd probably hold off until it was an important issue. I shook the thought off. It was irrelevant.</p><p>"Well, then. Let's get started." He dropped an old fashioned alarm clock on a tree stump and set it. "Here we go. It's set for noon. Your assignment is very simple. You just have to take these bells from me. That's all there is to it. If you can't get a bell, you go without lunch. You'll get tied to those post and watch while I eat my lunch in front of you."</p><p>"So that's why you told us not to eat breakfast!" Naruto shouted, pointing at him. I wondered if he'd made the same connection I had last night to the Mizuki situation. With Naruto, it was a tossup.</p><p>"There are only two bells." Sasuke was the one to point out the obvious 'flaw' in this arrangement.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei smiled. "That way, one of you will ultimately end up tied to the post and disqualified for failing to complete the mission. That one goes back to the Academy." He jingled the bells and added thoughtfully. "Then again, all three of you could flunk out too. You can use any weapons you have. If you aren't prepared to kill me, you wont be able to take the bells."</p><p>Kakashi was more than good enough to defeat us. We'd have to get insanely lucky to even get close to landing a killing blow. That wasn't the point. It was about intention. If your intention was weak, your blows were weak. You would question your purpose. Your actions would falter. You would fail. And if you failed, there was no point.</p><p><em> Do or do not, there is no try.</em></p><p>I swallowed, and then declared, "Troublesome. When we get the bells, you two can have them." Of course, it was more an <em> if</em> than a <em> when</em> , but it was the statement that counted. I could have sworn I saw Kakashi-sensei's eye twitch. I didn't want to have to come up against my team-mates, and if I could pre-empt the competition and get us working together -</p><p>"So, sensei," I continued, trying to keep my voice steady. "Can we have the bells?" It was implied we'd have to fight for them, but there are always other options. I'd rather settle things peacefully.</p><p>He stared. "No."</p><p>I shrugged a little shakily. "Worth a try. What would it take for you to give up the bells?" It wasn't like I had anything worth bribing him with anyway, but I thought I better put in a token effort. Always try and solve a problem diplomatically first. I noticed that Sasuke looked a little… surprised, if not approving.</p><p>"You'll have to take them by force." He smiled. "Now, when I say 'start' we can begin."</p><p>I dropped my voice low. Of course Kakashi could probably still hear me, he wasn't that far away, but that wasn't the point. "Naruto, make thirty clones and try and keep sensei in the clearing. Sasuke, you're best at close combat so I want you to wait for Naruto to make an opening." It wasn't much of a plan. As a Nara, I was probably expected to know, right down to the number of steps, just what moves everyone would make. I didn't. That's me - the Nara without a plan.</p><p>For a second, I thought they wouldn't listen then both boys nodded. It wasn't that either of them liked taking orders, but neither of them had anything planned and couldn't see the harm in it. Hopefully, I had established myself as worth listening to this morning. Maybe not as a leader, but at least as someone who knew <em> something.</em></p><p>"Well, then," Kakashi-sensei said. "Start."</p><p>Sasuke leapt away into the foliage, and Naruto had thirty clones encircling Kakashi-sensei in an instant. Sensei replied by taking out his book. The clones acted just like Naruto would have at someone ignoring them - infuriated. Naruto himself was about to leap in to combat as well, but I grabbed his arm.</p><p>"Make another ten clones and start spreading traps in the trees. Be careful of Sasuke, though," I hissed to him. He nodded, a little disappointed to not be fighting, but he liked setting traps. He was reasonably good at it, too, if you could get him to take it seriously.</p><p>Me, I had started using my Shadow Possession Jutsu almost immediately. I had chosen to stand in an area that was marginally shady. It wasn't really noticeable, particularly because my chakra enhanced shadow stood out blackly on it, but it did give me a little boost. Mostly, I had sent my shadow out to circle around Kakashi-sensei using the clones shadows. I wanted to entrap him and then catch him. Leaping across the shadow was just as good as having it grab you.</p><p>Of course, Kakashi-sensei probably knows more about the Shadow Possession Jutsu than I do. He's just that kind of person. In response to my tactics, he started popping the clones. Mostly he'd just been dodging them, letting them dog pile each other. Now he popped one here, one there, all at critical points where my shadow was already spread thin. It snapped. I drew back, and tried to send it in to catch him.</p><p>He kept dodging, both my shadow and the clones with such ease that he didn't even have to put his book away. Grudgingly, I admired him.</p><p>Then I started pelting him with kunai and shuriken. I threw them precise and angled, so that they wouldn't go stray and hit the clones. I couldn't be one hundred percent sure that Naruto <em> hadn't</em> joined in the fight. I was no Tenten, but Nara were mostly ranged fighters, so we did practice our throwing religiously.</p><p>He used a replacement jutsu, and the knives 'thunked' precisely into a log of wood. Of course, of course, he'd replaced himself just underneath where Sasuke was hiding. It was the perfect moment for him to attack and they both knew it. Sasuke fell for the bait.</p><p>It's hard to say he should have done otherwise, but it was so clearly <em> done on purpose</em> . The whole entire training grounds, and he lands there? Not a chance in hell.</p><p>I had withdrawn my shadow and it pooled around my feet in a nearly normal position. It was nearly noon and the sun was high so it took a lot of chakra to extend it very far. I started a basic Vertigo Genjutsu, but Sensei didn't so much as falter. Sasuke had the Naruto's backing him, but they nearly caused more problems for him than for Kakashi. There were just too many limbs trying to move in too small a space.</p><p>Still, he kept him occupied, and got off a single ninjutsu. The Naruto clones ducked and dived, and a few of them popped, as the huge fireball seemed to surround Kakashi. There was momentary panic as we lost him, but I was sure he wouldn't go far from the fight. This wasn't a tracking exercise.</p><p>Then Sasuke was yanked viciously underground, leaving his head sticking out of the dirt.</p><p>"Second lesson: Ninjutsu," Kakashi-sensei announced, brushing off his hands.</p><p>Then he was standing right in front of me. He'd crossed the clearing so fast I hadn't even seen him move. I didn't see the sucker punch either, and it felt like being hit with a ton of bricks. I gasped, I choked, no air made it into my lungs. According to Welfare measures breathlessness is one of the most distressing and unpleasant experiences a being can suffer. The sheer <em> desire</em> to breathe, backed by the panic at not being able too… yeah, I can see why.</p><p>"You shouldn't just stand there," Kakashi-sensei admonished cheerfully. "It makes you an easy target. Now, I've done Taijutsu and Ninjutsu, so I guess that leaves genjutsu for you." The intrusion of chakra into my system was a nasty feeling, sharp and biting, and I removed it even before it took hold and I saw what he wanted me to see. It was strong, and took a lot of concentration to get rid of but I had the advantage of being able to differentiate between my chakra and his.</p><p>If I had been able to reply I would have said 'Shadow Possession Jutsu complete'. He was standing in my patch of shade. That was all I needed.</p><p>Of course, there are ways out of the Shadow Possession. You cant move, but you can still use chakra. A sealess replacement was well within his capabilities. And Kakashi-sensei was so much stronger than me that he could have simply used the brute force method to get out.</p><p>Still, he did neither, and I awkwardly made him throw the bells back over his shoulder. A Naruto grabbed them immediately. Several more were still trying to dig Sasuke out of the ground.</p><p>Given that I'd practically ruined his test, removing my ability to talk and then letting the boys decide what to do with the bells was probably his next move in testing their commitment to teamwork. I had to admire, grudgingly and with pain, the kind of precision it took to hit someone hard enough to wind them, yet not do any actual damage. A blow like that could have ruptured my spleen, snapped all my ribs or done some serious internal damage, but all I'd get from it was a bruise.</p><p>I collapsed to my knees, the jutsu ending. The panic was the worst bit, the feeling of <em> not being able to breathe</em> . I knew, intellectually that I was just winded, and it would get better soon. Heck, I've even been winded before. But the panic was still there. It isn't a nice feeling.</p><p>"Shikako!" A Naruto came speeding out of the forest. I'm pretty sure this was the real one. It wasn't a big thing in this circumstance, but a wounded team-mate on a battle field could make damn good bait for a trap. "Ah! You killed her! She's dieing!"</p><p>"Idiot," Sasuke scoffed, now free from his hole. "She's just winded. She isn't dieing." He took a firm hold of my arm and hoisted me to my feet. "Hunching over like that isn't going to help."</p><p>Kakashi smiled, eye curving happily. "Now you've got the bells, Naruto, so who's going back to the Academy?"</p><p>Naruto stared down at the bells in his hands, then up at me. I jerked my head at Sasuke. Breathing was still an issue, speaking was out of the question.</p><p>He gave one of the bells to Sasuke like I wanted, then the other one to me. His face was determined but so heartbroken. I was sure that the team would pass as a team, yet they didn't know that. Naruto was serious about giving up his dream so I could pass. I frowned, and stuffed the bell down the collar of his shirt.</p><p>He hollered. "That's cold! What was that for?" He danced around, trying to get it out.</p><p>"Well then," Kakashi-sensei beamed. "I guess I have to say - You all pass!"</p><p>Naruto stopped dancing. "Wait, what?"</p><p>"Well, what do you think the purpose of this test was?" Kakashi-sensei asked patiently.</p><p>"Err, I don't know," Naruto said with a puzzled frown.</p><p>"Think about it," Kakashi suggested. "Three people, two bells. A pass or fail, all or nothing test."</p><p>I almost said 'teamwork', then I paused. It sounded … <em> trite.</em> It might have been true, but there was more to it than that. That was only the barest of explanations. "To put the good of the mission ahead of the good of the individual," I offered quietly.</p><p><em> Konoha is worth more than your life.</em> I shivered. In a real mission 'failure' often meant death. In terms of a real mission the briefing might have gone 'one of you will certainly die. All three of you might. What will you do?'. You couldn't just back out of a mission because it was dangerous. Not without very good reason.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei blinked slowly. "I purposely pitted you against each other. With only two bells, one of you was guaranteed to fail. The test was to see if you could overcome that for the sake of the mission. To see if you would work together or break apart. A Genin should have a natural feel for teamwork. Of course, you need individual skills, but teamwork is the most important element of a shinobi. When individuals put themselves above the squad, this can lead to failure. And death. On every mission, your life is on the line. Have you seen this stone?" He walked towards the memorial stone.</p><p>We exchanged a look and followed him.</p><p>"They are ninja who are honoured as hero in our village." His voice had a distinctly solemn note to it.</p><p>"That's it! I'm going to have my name on there!" Naruto exclaimed.</p><p>I winced and shook my head.</p><p>"What?" he asked, confused.</p><p>"They a special kind of hero," Kakashi continued. "They are the ninja who were killed in action. This is the memorial stone. The names of my closest friends are all engraved here."</p><p>My uncle, dad's younger brother, was on there and more of the clan besides. Kyougi Nara had only been added three months ago - I knew her vaguely but mostly I remember the way her mother cried at the funeral. She had been nineteen and a Chunin.</p><p>Yeah, there is honour to dieing for Konoha. But you're still dead.</p><p>"So," Kakashi said, turning to us, chasing the gloomy atmosphere away. "Now I've explained my part in the test, you get to explain yours."</p><p>"What do you mean?" Naruto asked with a puzzled frown. "You just said. Our part was to work together."</p><p>"Well, you must have had a plan, didn't you? A reason why you attacked the way you did?"</p><p>Naruto chuckled sheepishly. "I just did what Shikako said." He rubbed the back of his head.</p><p>Sasuke glanced at me then back to Kakashi. "Naruto was the distraction. He was supposed to create an opening so I could go for the bells."</p><p>Kakashi nodded. "Rudimentary, but effective." He turned to me. "Now why don't you explain to your team mates the way <em> you</em> decided who would do what."</p><p>"Umm. W-well," I stuttered. "Like Sasuke said Naruto's Shadow Clone Jutsu is good for surrounding people. And they cast shadows… so I can use them for my Jutsu. Sasuke is the best at Taijutsu out of all of us, and the fastest, so he'd have the best chance at grabbing the bells…" I trailed off, not sure what else to say.</p><p>"Why the straight out charge?" Kakashi-sensei prompted. "Most kids would have tried to hide first."</p><p>"Five reasons," I said holding up a finger. "We had to overcome you. There was no way we could get the bells by avoiding you." A second finger. "You knew we were here, so we couldn't attempt to surprise you and take you off guard." A third finger. "Your tracking skills are much greater than our stealth abilities, so even trying to hide would have been pointless." A fourth finger. "The clearing gave us more advantages than disadvantages because it allowed us to keep you in our sight. Naruto had traps spread through the trees in case you went that way." The last finger. "And we were on a time limit. Hiding might have brought us time to plan, but we had no information on your capabilities … so it was best to try something before retreating and trying for a second attempt."</p><p>Naruto looked stunned. "You thought about all that? But you came up with the plan, like, right away!"</p><p>I looked down. "Well, it wasn't a very complex plan," I mumbled.</p><p>"Are you kidding? It was great! I was like 'wazzam' and 'kapow' and then Sasuke was like 'zzzwssshhh' and he nearly got the bells!" His hands fluttered about in mock combat with each other.</p><p>"Right," Kakashi-sensei cut him off. "I think that concludes our debriefing. Team Seven will start their first mission tomorrow. For now, we can all go home."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Graduation Arc: Chapter 6</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert</p><p>Author's note: If you've read the semi-recent manga, you'll know that the oath/earrings is actual canon. We don't see any but the Akimichi oath, but I twisted it a little to fit. Weird custom, but kinda neat.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 6</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The future depends on what we do in the present ~ Mahatma Gandhi</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>It was only barely past lunch time when Kakashi-sensei dismissed us for the day. Since he'd been hours late in showing up, and I didn't think that would change, I foresaw being on this team as having a lot of self directed training time. Which wasn't so bad for me, because I had plenty of different projects already going, but might not have been the best method for Sasuke and Naruto.</p><p>Then again, it might have been sensei's way of saying 'welcome to the real world. No one is going to push you anymore'.</p><p>That had been the really big step about going to University in my old life. It was kinda different here, and the Academy had been much less teacher driven than any primary school I'd been to back in that other life, but there was still a relevant point about taking charge of your own life. I don't know if twelve was really old enough to see that, but since they were expecting us to be child soldiers and make life or death decisions, it was probably necessary.</p><p>I remember being twelve, that first time. Twelve year olds think they can do anything. The twelve year olds around me think that they'll be fine. It's only me that has doubts.</p><p>Now that's irony.</p><p>I went to look for Ino first. Shikamaru had mumbled something about morning training last night, so they were probably finished before we were. Team Ten hadn't been given a Jounin test so there was no reason for Ino to expect that the rest of us would have, unless her father had said anything.</p><p>When I found her, she was in the Yamanaka flower shop. The Yamanaka flower shop is pretty well known in Konoha. Not only do they sell flowers, they have a sideline in distilling poisons and have a specialised greenhouse for growing medicinal plants that they sell to us, the Akimichi and the hospital. A lot of the medicinal herbs they grow don't do so well in the temperate climate of Konoha, and need a lot of looking after. It seems kind of an odd career set for a clan of mind jutsu specialists, but there are rumours that the Yamanaka have a truth serum so powerful that three drops can have you spilling all your innermost secrets.</p><p>I'm not sure that's the truth, but the body and mind are not separate things. What affects one affects the other. I'm sure that there are chemical stimulants that can make people more susceptible to mind jutsu.</p><p>Ino wasn't working, or I'd have been more hesitant to disturb her, she was just puttering around watering pots and arranging bouquets. The three of us had spent a fair amount of time in this shop over the years, and her father had never seemed to mind. He was a very calm man. I hesitate to call him laidback, since that means something extreme coming from a Nara, but he was very centred, like he had long ago decided what was important to him and wasn't going to get worked up about anything less.</p><p>"Good afternoon, Yamanaka-san," I said politely as I entered the shop. He barely had time to acknowledge me before Ino pounced.</p><p>"Shikako! Is it true? Shikamaru said that your sensei was testing you. Asuma-sensei didn't do that to us, but then again, we are the Ino-Shika-Cho. So, tell me! What was it like? Did you pass?"</p><p>Ino was smarter than people gave her credit for. A large part of that was her unfortunate fan girl tendencies but she came from a ninja clan. More than that, she came from a ninja clan that specialised in <em> reading people</em> . You don't put together a team like Team Ten to fail them. Of all the teams this year, theirs is probably the most stable. Individually they're stable with no major quirks, their techniques work together well, and all three of them are born and bred for teamwork.</p><p>"Ah," I said, bobbing a nod. "We passed."</p><p>She squealed, clapping her hands together. "I'm so glad. What was it like? What did you do?"</p><p>I gave a quick run down of the test and how we had acted. Predictably, Ino was far more interested in what Sasuke had done than in how Naruto had acted, though I swear I saw Inoichi raise a brow in surprise.</p><p>"Sasuke-kun helped you? That's so romantic." She practically had stars in her eyes. "You're so lucky to be on a team with him. All I have are Shikamaru and Chouji. One's lazy and the other eats all the time."</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "They'll watch your back," I said instead of protesting. I knew she wasn't <em> that</em> annoyed at their personal habits. It was all surface. Beneath that, they were close friends. Of course, it wasn't like I could protest those surface habits anyway. Shikamaru <em> was</em> lazy and he was smart enough to get away with being lazy. No matter how much I made him train with me, it would take something serious to shake him out of that. I just hoped it wasn't too serious.</p><p>"I know, I know," Ino said, shaking the platitude off. "It's just… Shikamaru and Chouji, you know? Even our sensei is…" she flopped her hand backwards and forwards, not verbalising just what exactly their sensei was. I still got the picture. Team Ten was hardly <em> exciting</em> . Ino had graduated the academy, ready and eager for the new, bright and shinning ninja world, only to be grouped with her childhood friends and a soft spoken chain smoking sensei. Comparatively Team Seven was positively exotic.</p><p>It might not have been a good thing, but I doubted it was going to be boring. Well, besides having to wait for sensei to show up in the morning.</p><p>"So, tell me. What's your sensei like? We didn't see him before we left with Asuma-sensei."</p><p>"He was late," I said dryly. Across the shop, Inoichi's shoulders twitched with a stifled laugh. It looks like he knew exactly who my sensei was too. I wondered if Genin assignments were juicy gossip, or if he'd only paid attention because Ino was graduating this year.</p><p>"Shikaaako," Ino whined. "Stop ogling my dad and talk to me."</p><p>I blinked. Opened my mouth. No words came out. I worked my jaw. "Ino!" There it was. A little squeaky but my voice was working again. Inoichi was definitely laughing now. At least someone was having fun. "You… I…" I spluttered, words having deserted me. The familiar burn of social embarrassment was starting in my chest.</p><p>Her face was so innocent it should have belonged to a kitten. "Joking, joking, I'm only joking," she giggled out after a moment. "But your face…"</p><p>I scowled at her, not very amused by the teasing. Embarrassing me in front of her dad wasn't <em> funny.</em></p><p>"You just had that look on your face. You know, 'some one has done something interesting and I must find out why'!"</p><p>"That's a look?" I asked, bemused. I wasn't aware I had been so obvious, or that it happened often enough that she had categorised it.</p><p>"Right up there with 'this book is interesting' and 'I just had an idea about how to make things explode'," Ino confirmed.</p><p>"I don't explode things!" I protested. "Often." Somehow the clarification took most of the force out of the argument.</p><p>"Exploding tags. That's all I'm going to say," Ino said. And okay, it had taken me a little while to work out how to make my own exploding tags. And yes, there had been a few times when it had not quite worked properly. And yes, I had made a few… adjustments afterwards. But hey, I had tags with a variety of strengths, timers and radius as well as fire based explosions, concussive blasts, light and sound tags and shock tags. Making tags was easy, once you knew how. The real trick of combat seal masters was applying seals without the fuss of paper and ink. They said that the Fourth could lay a seal any place he touched. Meaning, if he got his hands on you, even the barest of touches, you were dead.</p><p>I had no idea how to do it. None of the books and scrolls I had even mentioned it.</p><p>I coughed. "Anyway. Have you heard from Sakura?"</p><p>"No, not yet. Do you think she'll be done by now?" Ino frowned, a hint of worry on her face. I think she also knew that Sakura was the least likely of all of us to pass.</p><p>"Probably." I shrugged. "Do you want to go find her?"</p><p>The Haruno's didn't live far from the Yamanaka's, which was part of the reason that Ino and Sakura had always raced each other to school in the morning. Sakura's parents were both civilians and she had always been really proud of the fact that she was the first kunoichi of her family. She wore the empty circle on her clothes in the place we wore our clan symbols because of it. It was a statement of intent; she was going to have a clan, all she needed was the skill to fill in the mon.</p><p>Ino knocked on the door. Mrs Haruno answered it with a wan smile. "Hello, girls. Sakura… isn't really in the mood for visitors right now."</p><p>The horrid guilt settled in my gut. "She didn't pass." It was the most logical assumption, and to a degree, I had been expecting it. That didn't make it any better.</p><p>Ino snapped around to look at me, then at Mrs Haruno for confirmation. She nodded tiredly.</p><p>"We have to see her!" Ino blurted out. "Please, Haruno-san!"</p><p>She let us in with a sigh and we scuttled upstairs to Sakura's room. Her room was nearly as familiar to me as my own, or as Ino's, we had spent so much time at each other's houses.</p><p>"Sakura?" Ino called, knocking gently on the door before opening it.</p><p>"Go away," Sakura muttered, turning her face away from us. She had blotchy tear marks all down her face. We exchanged looks. How did you comfort someone like this?</p><p>I climbed on the bed beside her and wrapped her in a hug. Ino mirrored me on her other side. "What happened, Sakura?"</p><p>She sniffed. "Takahiro-sensei failed us. He said… he said none of us were mature or prepared enough to be a ninja… and that we didn't have any special skills to make up for the lack."</p><p>I shared a glance with Ino. It was harsh, but true. Ino was equally a fan girl, but she had her clan jutsu. Naruto was equally juvenile at times, but he had his insane stamina and healing (not to mention Kyuubi) to make up for it.</p><p>"He was right, wasn't he?" she said, voice broken like the little girl I'd met picking flowers years ago. "He called me a silly little girl playing kunoichi."</p><p>"Don't say that," Ino cut in, voice firm. "You're not… You're one of the best kunoichi in our year. You always scored better than me, remember?"</p><p>"Book smarts," Sakura sniffed. "The one time it really mattered…" she trailed off.</p><p>"It's not over yet," I said quietly. "You can try again, you know." It was poor consolation but it was the truth. Very few students opted too, but it was an option.</p><p>"I guess," Sakura said. Even if she did pass next year, she would still be a year behind us. When you were twelve, a year was a long time.</p><p>"You know," I offered gently, "you've got good chakra control. You could make a good medic nin."</p><p>"…Really?" Sakura sniffled.</p><p>I nodded. "The program at the hospital does take academy graduates. It's a lot of training, and you'll probably have to do hospital work before you're qualified for field work, but medic nins are in high demand."</p><p>"How do you know that?" Ino asked in surprise.</p><p>I shrugged. "I kinda thought about being a medic nin for a while. Since we do a lot of medicine, quite a few Nara work at the hospital. My aunt offered to sponsor me through the program. I think, if we can show her that you'll be a good medic she'll sponsor you too. If you want that is."</p><p>"I don't know," Sakura said, twisting her fingers in the hem of her dress.</p><p>"You don't have to decide now. I mean, you've got other options, like trying again next year, or the Genin Corps. You should think about it. Talk to Iruka-sensei or something." Most of the years failures ended up in the Genin Corps. I mean, our class didn't have a single repeating student.</p><p>Sakura nodded. "Yeah," she wavered. "I'll think about it."</p><p>That was all she said, but that was all there really was to say. Her parents had never really wanted her to be a ninja, but that was more because they just didn't <em> understand</em> than anything else. They'd never really wanted her to fail. I was pretty sure they'd support her if she wanted to become a med-nin, a doctor, much more than if she wanted to go back to the Academy.</p><p>That depended on Sakura wanting to be a medic though. She would be good at it, but that didn't necessary she <em> wanted</em> to.</p><p>We changed the topic and hung around for a few hours. Sakura was in an undeniably better mood when we left but Ino was frowning slightly. The group dynamic had just changed on her, and she hadn't seen it coming. No matter what Sakura chose, the three of us were no longer the same.</p><p>"I'd better go," I said awkwardly as we paused at the crossroads that would take me back to the clan farm. "Family tradition." I self consciously touched my ears which were currently bare. Ino, I had noticed, was already wearing a pair of studs. Earrings and jewellery weren't common on ninja - too easy to grab and pull - but we wore them for symbolism rather than vanity.</p><p>She smirked and nodded. "We went this morning," she confided. "Have fun."</p><p>It was much closer to twilight by the time dad came home and we were all ready to go, but the fading light suited us as Nara more than the bright afternoon sunlight would have. You needed light to have shadows but there was a legend that the founder of the clan, many hundreds of years ago, could control the very night itself.</p><p>"Congratulations on becoming Genin, kids," Shikaku said, slouching out of the front door. "Lets go to the memorial stone."</p><p>He didn't mean the village memorial stone, but the Akimichi-Nara-Yamanaka one. It was located to the far back of the Nara grounds and I don't know if anyone besides our three clans knew it existed. It was a private monument, one where we swore oaths.</p><p>It didn't take us long to get there.</p><p>"Ready?" Dad asked, voice unusually soft and quiet. Neither he nor Shikamaru were slouching.</p><p>Shikamaru nodded and stepped forward so he was standing in front of the monument. The three clan symbols were directly at eye height for an average Genin.</p><p>"I hereby swear that," he began, voice carrying around the small clearing, "as the sixteenth head of the Nara, I will entrust the oath entrusted to me by the fifteenth to the child that will become the seventeenth! In order to protect both the Yamanaka and the Akimichi clans and to protect Konoha, I, Shikamaru Nara, will become one with the shadows."</p><p>I knew that the Akimichi version of the oath referenced becoming a butterfly and the Yamanaka swore to open their minds. These all alluded to what we considered our supreme techniques - and the most dangerous.</p><p>Shikamaru stepped back and I walked into place. Shikamaru had sworn the oath of the clan heir, but mine was the modified version that the rest of the clan used.</p><p>"I, Shikako Nara, do hereby swear, that to protect my team mates, the clan, those allied with us and Konoha itself, I will become one with the shadows."</p><p>The order of priorities was only subtly important. We had worked with the Akimichi, Yamanaka and Sarutobi clans long before Konoha was founded. The fact that the clan head at the time had modified the oath to include it actually showed just how much the clan <em> believed</em> in the ideals of a peaceful Konoha. After all, we certainly don't go to anymore effort than we absolutely have to.</p><p>Dads face was pensive when I turned around. He nodded. "Your oaths are heard." He reached into the pockets of his jounin vest and withdrew a small container. "These are the earrings that my younger brother and I wore. They will whisper your oaths into your ears so that you never forget them. When you become Chunin, you will gain your own earrings and become an adult in the eyes of the clan." He hesitated, then continued, voice serious. "And remember, the clan will always stand with you."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Graduation Arc: Chapter 7</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert</p><p>Authors note: There are links on my profile page to Fanart for this story if anyone is interested. FFNet won't let me put them here for you. And just a side note regarding the missions, I based the information on Kabuto's nin cards which, if I recall rightly, stated that Team 7 had done 1 A-rank and 7 D-rank missions. It doesn't seem like very many, but I try not to contradict canon overtly. Also, I thought I'd get up to the Wave Mission this chapter, but it wasn't to be.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 7</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done.~ Marie Curie </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>It was easy to fall into a routine with Team Seven. The day after the bell test, after my oath, we met at the Training Grounds ready to go for a mission. Kakashi-sensei had said nine o'clock, but that came and went without a sighting of him.</p><p>I felt strangely pensive. I had known the Oath before, but saying it, having it witnessed by the Clan Head… was strangely final.</p><p><em> I swear, that to protect my team mates, the clan, those allied with us and Konoha itself, I will become one with the shadows.</em></p><p>More so than simply becoming a Genin, there was no turning back now. The Oath meant everything to the Clan.</p><p>I looked over to my team mates. Sasuke was frowning into the distance and Naruto was throwing pebbles into the lake. They were bored. I could have pulled out a book and started reading but I wanted to <em> connect</em> with them.</p><p>"Hey," I started, clearing my throat. It wasn't particularly loud but Sasuke looked up. "Do you two want to spar?"</p><p>He looked intrigued. "Hn. Not sure the dead last has much to add to a fight."</p><p>Naruto was very hard to put down in a fight, but that didn't help if he couldn't contribute much. I wasn't really sure what his fighting was like at this stage anyway but in a free for all, he'd probably be outclassed. That wasn't arrogance but if I threw a genjutsu at him, I doubt he'd be able to break it. I bit my lip.</p><p>"Me and Naruto against you?"</p><p>Sasuke looked intrigued. "Rules?"</p><p>I thought about it. "No injuries. We have to do a mission after, and I don't know what we'll have to do. Stop before exhaustion and we can call a timeout at any time? And we stay in the clearing." No point getting lost before Kakashi-sensei showed up.</p><p>Sasuke stood and brushed off his pants. "Oi, dead last!" He called. Naruto popped up like some demented jack-in-the-box shouting back at him. "We're going to spar. You and Shikako against me!"</p><p>"Prepare to go down, bastard!" Naruto shouted at the challenge. I didn't really engage in trash talk, but I didn't like to lose either. Of course, winning might to terrible things to Naruto's ego. That could be squashed later.</p><p>We squared off across the clearing. I stood slightly behind Naruto. He'd probably start off with a straight charge, shadow clones optional. Sasuke would meet him; he didn't like to run from fights. Probably taijutsu, since he was screeds better at it than Naruto. He was a decent all rounder, but his focus was definitely in the nin-tai area.</p><p>It was early morning, so the shadows were pretty long. That gave me a fair bit to work with. I hadn't used any of my Earth Style techniques fighting Kakashi-sensei and I wasn't sure either of the boys had picked up on my genjutsu so both of those would come as a surprise. My taijutsu was good, and <em> if</em> I could keep my shadow active during it could be positively deadly (I was still working on that, to be honest) but I'd probably try and avoid getting that close to Sasuke - with space to manoeuvre and access to weapons he'd probably be harder to take down than in the Academy sparring ring. Which had never been particularly easy anyway.</p><p>"Ready?" I asked.</p><p>Sasuke nodded.</p><p>Naruto charged forward with a yell, a line of clones popping into existence beside him.</p><p>Game on.</p><p>I ran through the seals for the Vertigo genjutsu. Genjutsu was difficult to use, it required a lot of concentration and attention to detail - particularly if you were going to try and use visual genjutsu - and precise chakra control to form Yin Release chakra. For most techniques, chakra was a mix of spiritual and physical chakra in equal proportion. When you didn't have equal amounts, the excess was just wasted, unless you formed Yin or Yang chakra which was unbalanced chakra. Yin had more spiritual than physical while Yang was the exact opposite. It takes a lot of control to hold unbalanced chakra, and even more to use both concurrently in the Yin-Yang Release <em> while preventing them from mixing back to normal balanced chakra.</em> I couldn't do that yet, but I could form them separately. Yin Release chakra is characterised as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse and passive (and, strangely, feminine which is why there are more female medics and genjutsu users than male) and is the basis for both genjutsu and most medical ninjutsu techniques.</p><p>The Vertigo genjutsu was one of my favourites really; it was simple and effective. It targeted the semi-circular canals in the inner ear and disrupted the fluid inside them, causing the nerve endings to send contradictory signals to the brain about how the body was moving. The end result was dizziness and, if left long enough, nausea and vomiting. The amount of chakra taken to stir the fluid was miniscule and all the symptoms were actual signals by the body, making it difficult to cancel. Since it affected only a very, very small area, if you could isolate your genjutsu probe from the host chakra system, you might even be able to make it <em> impossible</em> to cancel.</p><p>That was basically the holy grail of genjutsu use.</p><p>I was no where near that stage yet but that didn't mean it wasn't useful. It was, as any Nara knew, all about timing.</p><p>"Yin Release: Vestibular Disruption!" I chanted just as Naruto reached Sasuke to attack. Sasuke stumbled, trying desperately to block a multitude of attacks and release the genjutsu at the same time. I launched my shadow forward, bouncing from clone to tree to clone in an attempt to bind him.</p><p>Naruto had got in a few good attacks and knowing he was overwhelmed Sasuke retreated, using a replacement to cross the clearing. The break gave him enough time to muster his chakra for a 'kai', even as I pelted his new location with kunai and shuriken. He was running now and I intended to keep him that way. I preferred my fights to be quick, with a sudden explosion of overwhelming force.</p><p>Sasuke knocked away the kunai and homed in on me. I was, in his eyes, the true threat right now. I abandoned the part of my shadow that was sneaking through the trees, and focused on what was pooling around my feet. We didn't 'use up' our shadows during the jutsu, just stretched them, and it was more than possible to hold multiple opponents with it. He was fast, dodging the lancing attacks of my shadow even as his hands worked through hand signs I had seen once before.</p><p><em> Shit.</em> I quickly ran through my own set of hand signs, grateful that this technique only had four.</p><p>"Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique!"</p><p>"Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall!" The wall barely came up to chest height and I ducked down into the lee behind it.</p><p>The fireball impacted against the wall, blowing smoke up into the air, but Sasuke was leaping through it, up over top of the wall, dropping with a heel kick where I was crouching. I rolled out of the way, coming to my feet beside him.</p><p>"Transformation Technique: Ten Thousand Fists!" When we were learning the basic clone and transformation techniques at the Academy, I had been constantly surprised at how many different ways my classmates could get it wrong. I'd manage both of them the first time and had been a little … scornful, maybe, of how slow everyone else was. Then I noticed how very spectacular some of those 'failures' were. One of the most common ways to spot a poorly formed clone was when it moved; not all the pieces moved together at the same time. There would be a lag blur.</p><p>I had applied that to my transformation technique. I was punching at Sasuke, but my real hand was obscured by illusions of dozens of other fists at different angles, distances and speeds. He had no idea which one to block. I slammed my fists into him, once in the stomach and a follow up to the chin, dropping my transformation to lash out with my shadow. I couldn't hold two techniques concurrently, yet, but I was working on it. Sasuke backflipped out of range, using my Earth Wall as a spring board to get height and distance.</p><p>And landed straight in a group of Naruto's that had been waiting for him on the other side. His expression was priceless.</p><p>"Get him!" Came their rallying cry. Naruto definitely had a brawler style. One on one, he lost to Sasuke every time. Five on one, ten on one… it was a little more even.</p><p>Sasuke weaved and dodged and lashed out, but for every clone he took out there was another to take it's place. Added to that, he had to keep an eye out for my shadow, which was darting from Naruto to Naruto, hemming him in and cutting off his choices of movement.</p><p>He was falling back, away from the Earth Wall towards the trees, where he'd replaced to before, and coincidentally, I had sent my shadow before I'd had to change tactics. It was still there, lying in wait like a long black snake.</p><p>He retreated some more, then jumped, landing safely on a branch above our heads. Naruto was less agile and couldn't follow him up there. But…</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," I said, hands in rat seal. I'd abandoned the shadow 'tail' that had been chasing him and reused the first that circled nearly half the clearing. I bent my neck to let Sasuke see the black trail that squirmed up the tree trunk to his feet. "Surrender?" I asked.</p><p>"Or?" He queried.</p><p>Good question. Shadow Possession didn't automatically end the fight. "I step backwards," I said. A fall from that height wouldn't really hurt much, but being paralysed he wouldn't be able to roll with it, and Naruto was waiting for him below. I wasn't <em> entirely</em> sure that I'd be able to hold the Possession through a change in height like that though. I made a note to investigate later; I obviously needed more work in a 3D environment.</p><p>Sasuke considered, then nodded. "I surrender."</p><p>I let the jutsu go. Naruto cheered. "Good fight," I offered with a small uncertain smile. Now that we had won, I wasn't really sure how Sasuke would take it.</p><p>Sasuke nodded, jumping down from the tree branch and landing lightly on his feet. There was something like satisfaction, or maybe respect, in his eyes.</p><p>"Aren't you going to say anything, bastard?" Naruto crowed. "We won. You lost. We won!"</p><p>I cringed. "Please stop that, Naruto."</p><p>He either didn't hear me or ignored me. "Naruto!" I snapped.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks, blinking at me, startled. "Shikako?" He said uncertainly. "Aren't you happy? We won."</p><p>I took a calming breath. It wasn't news that Naruto was a poorly socialised idiot. I just had to explain, that was all. "It isn't polite to act like that, Naruto. When you win, you have to be gracious about it, otherwise all you do is create enemies. Not just the people you beat, but everyone who sees you acting like that."</p><p>"What? But I won! Everyone has totally got to see how awesome I am now!" Naruto shouted.</p><p>Sasuke's hands were clenching into fists at his side was starting to glare. I needed to diffuse this. Fast.</p><p>Pity I didn't know how. "Do you see the Hokage shouting about how many fights he's won? Or Iruka-sensei?" I asked quickly, naming people I knew Naruto respected. "Iruka-sensei didn't even tell us how he got hurt after graduation. I bet he didn't act like that then."</p><p>Naruto stopped jumping and stared down at the ground. I felt a little guilty about bringing that up since he had actually told me how Iruka-sensei got hurt.</p><p>"That was… different," he said, unconsciously touching his headband. "Iruka-sensei <em> was</em> awesome."</p><p>"Exactly," I agreed. "And when you do something awesome people will know it too. You don't have to tell them. Besides… doesn't it mean something more when other people say it?"</p><p>He looked up, eyes unfocused, like I'd just explained the entire universe to him. "Yeah. Yeah, it does."</p><p>I nodded, and let go of the tension that was building in my shoulders. "So. Good fight." I nodded to him.</p><p>He smiled back, something that was softer and calmer and more <em> grateful</em> than his usual grins. "It was a good fight."</p><p>I tilted my head towards Sasuke, the implication clear.</p><p>Naruto scowled. "And… you too. It was a good fight. Bastard."</p><p>"Hn. You did alright. Dead last."</p><p>Naruto might have scowled harder, but that off hand comment clearly meant to world to him, even if he didn't acknowledge it.</p><p>I sighed, rolled my shoulders and checked my chakra levels. They were astonishingly depleted. Nearly half gone from that little half hour spar. I'd used what, three, four techniques? Not good. We didn't do a lot of sparring at home, even though I worked on the technical details of my jutsu a fair bit. Sparring with Shika was just an exercise in frustration and my older shinobi cousins were too busy for any kind of regular training.</p><p>We collected all our weapons and headed back to the bridge to sit down and wait.</p><p>"Did you want to talk about the match?" I asked, fumbling with the words slightly.</p><p>"What for?" Naruto blinked at me, still in an introspective mood. At least it was quieter.</p><p>"So that next time we can do better," I answered.</p><p>"Hn. You caught me off guard with that genjutsu," Sasuke offered after a pause. "What was it?"</p><p>It sort of went against my nature to explain my techniques, but this was my team. However, if I ever started doing a battle monologue helpfully entitled 'how to beat me' I'd ask someone to stab me.</p><p>"Yin Release: Vestibular Disruption induces vertigo," I explained. "It's a targeted genjutsu - that means you use it on an opponent not on your surroundings -" I clarified for Naruto at his confused expression. "It disrupts balance mostly, but if you leave it long enough it can make you nauseous and vomit."</p><p>"Gross!" Naruto exclaimed looking delighted.</p><p>"I didn't expect you to have anything but your shadow jutsu," Sasuke admitted.</p><p>"Most Nara don't," I agreed with a grimace. "I like to have a little variety though. You need to be really smart to succeed with only one kind of jutsu."</p><p>"What do you mean?" Naruto asked. "Your shadow jutsu is awesome! Not as cool as my Shadow Clones, though."</p><p>I grinned. "But your Shadow Clones can't do everything. They pop easily. And you couldn't get at Sasuke once he was up the tree, could you? Although the tree walking technique will fix that, I guess. But. Each jutsu has limitations."</p><p>Sasuke grunted in agreement. We kept talking about the match until sensei got there. It was nice. Companionable. Sasuke and Naruto weren't exactly getting on but their comments were still <em> mostly</em> constructive.</p><p>"Well good morning, my cute little Genin." Sensei perched on top of the railing and waved at us.</p><p>"You're late!" Naruto shouted, jumping to his feet and pointing.</p><p>"Well you see," Kakashi-sensei began. "There was a spider in my bathroom so I couldn't get dressed until it left."</p><p>There was a beat of stunned silence.</p><p>"Liar!" Naruto hollered. It was hard to tell, but I think Kakashi was amused by our reactions. He'd have to be, to keep using excuses like that.</p><p>"So, today we're going to take a mission. Let's go to the Hokage's Tower."</p><p>Naruto cheered. That boy had way too much energy. I pulled myself to my feet and flushed chakra through my body to dispel any lingering aches and pains. It wasn't quite a healing technique but it was still damned useful. More so than the instantaneous pain of getting hit, I hated the lingering ache of overexertion.</p><p>We ambled to the Hokage's Tower, our pace set by Kakashi-sensei who seemed to be going just slightly faster than the speed of a blind, geriatric cripple. Hmm… that actually sounded like Kakashi-sensei anyway.</p><p>Regardless, the pace seemed to be really irritating my team mates if Sasuke's hunched posture was any indication. You didn't even need to <em> guess</em> to know Naruto was annoyed, since he was very vocally proclaiming it.</p><p>"We're finally going to get a super cool mission and you're being all <em> slow!</em> Hurry up!"</p><p>Really, I think Kakashi-sensei just liked winding Naruto up.</p><p>Of course, given that I <em> knew</em> what D-ranks were Naruto wasn't going to be very happy when we got there, either. D-ranks were chores, or maybe community service type missions. They were funded, or at the least subsidised by the village itself and so were usually for either the clans or other important figures. As far as I was aware, clearing and restructuring the Training Fields after they get demolished is one of the most common D-rank missions in Konoha.</p><p>Although, Naruto's utterly stunned face when the Hokage read out the possible mission assignments was kind of amusing. Sasuke seemed equally unimpressed. Kakashi-sensei gave a very good impression of not paying any attention at all.</p><p>I looked back and forth between them, wondering if any of them were going to answer the Hokage. Surely Kakashi-sensei should?</p><p>He turned a page. The scraping of paper was very loud in the silence of the Mission Assignment room.</p><p>"Uh, babysitting?" I offered uncertainly as the Hokage raised an eyebrow at us.</p><p>"Very well," he said, picking up a scroll off the table and making a mark on his list. "Team Seven accepts the mission to baby sit the Chief Councillors three year old."</p><p>"What kind of mission is that?" Naruto shouted suddenly, arms pin wheeling.</p><p>"A D-rank mission, Naruto!" Iruka-sensei shouted back. "As new Genin, these are the kinds of missions you'll be doing until you gain some experience!"</p><p>Naruto pouted.</p><p>"Ahem," the Hokage cut in. Iruka sunk back into his seat, slightly flustered. "Team Seven. Your mission scroll."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei caught the scroll lazily as it arched through the air. It might have seemed strange to throw important paperwork but properly rolled scrolls were strangely aerodynamic. That was probably the reason people still used them instead of books or files. It certainly can't have been for storage purposes.</p><p>"Alright, ducklings," Sensei said. "Let's mosey."</p><p>Shinji Hideaki was a sweet kid that was entirely too used to having ninja teams baby sit him while his father was off in important meetings. The influx of strange people into his house bothered him not at all. We were rostered on for five hours, which included lunch, and had a whole schedule included. The missions scroll was amazingly well prepared for a D-rank which just emphasised the fact that this must be a commonly reoccurring mission.</p><p>"Read me a story, please?" He asked, grabbing onto my pants and tugging. In one sticky hand he held a very battered and beloved copy of 'The Yellow Flash' which was possibly the most adored children's book in all of Konoha.</p><p>"Sure thing, sweetheart," I said, picking him up and carrying him to the couch where he eagerly squirmed into my lap. It was at least an hour before we had to start cooking lunch - of which we had strict instructions as to what he would and would not eat and how to prepare it - and the others were just standing around awkwardly. Well, four people was probably overkill for a mission like this. If there had been more than one child, maybe, but even then I'm not sure the three of them would have known what to do. I wasn't exactly big on kids, but there were several younger Nara cousins and I had been an older sister once.</p><p>"… And the Yellow Flash went Flash! Flash! Flash!" I finished, performing the required flicking finger movements, the ones that always reminded me of light bulbs or flicking water.</p><p>"Flash! Flash! Flash!" Shinji giggled and clapped. "Again?"</p><p>I looked at the clock. "Maybe not, sweetheart. Do you want to do some drawing?" I asked, spying the crayons and paper on the floor. "We'll get Naruto to sit with you." I wasn't really sure what the others were up to, but tracking chakra signals was easy enough. He was just down the hallway.</p><p>"Naruto? Can you watch Shinji while I make lunch?" I called. I wasn't entirely sure that either of my team mates could cook. I could probably ask, but it was just as easy for me to make lunch.</p><p>"Sure!" he shouted back. I waited for him to make his appearance in the living room before I left.</p><p>The kitchen was ultra organised. I pulled out the instructions for dinner and found that they had included enough food for us which was actually very kind. Many clients seemed to forget that ninja needed to eat which was why we were advised to bring enough food for the mission duration whenever we went on long distance missions. In Konoha it wasn't so bad, since we could have easily sent one of us off to buy lunch, but it was still <em> nice</em> . Thoughtful.</p><p>I wasn't the best cook in the world; I was too easily bored, impatient with waiting for things to simmer or fry or whatever, and not fussy enough about what I ate to fix either of those things. But I <em> had</em> learnt to cook from my mum, who was a great cook, and that almost meant that cooking dinner was 'girl time' and that offset the boredom.</p><p>Of course, cooking for other people meant I at least tried to cook well. I might not be fussy but there was something slightly embarrassing about serving other people charcoal. I hummed as I chopped the vegetables and brought a pot of water to boil on the stove. The rice cooker was already going, since that took longer to cook properly.</p><p>The kitchen was very nice, I mused, as I grabbed spices from one of the upper cupboards. Surprisingly modern, but it made very efficient use of space.</p><p>"What're you making?" A curious voice asked.</p><p>I spun around and nearly froze in horror. Shinji peeked up at the counter grabbing a hold of the bench to see up, his other hand reaching towards the pot on the stove. His hand was balanced on the cutting board that I'd just abandoned and was tilting precariously. I could see it happening. He'd pull, the board would tilt, the knife would fall on him, and likely, the pot of boiling water on the stove would fall on him as well.</p><p><em> Shit.</em></p><p>My shadow lashed out, freezing him in place, but that wouldn't stop events already in motion. Chakra strings uncoiled from my fingers, attaching to board, knife and pot and pulling them back away from the edges. I couldn't do fine manipulation with them, and I couldn't move while holding all these different things.</p><p>Where was Naruto? Who was closest?</p><p>Naruto was down the hall in the bathroom. But Sasuke was only out on the veranda.</p><p>"Sasuke!" My voice may have been slightly panicked, because he appeared with a flicker of boosted speed, one hand already reaching for a kunai. He took the scene in and grabbed Shinji, hoisting him up and retreating out of the kitchen to the hallway.</p><p>It had taken maybe a few seconds, but my heart was pounding worse than at the spar this morning. I shakily set the chopping board and knife in the sink and made sure to turn the handle of the pot towards the back. I should have had it like that to start with, but I hadn't thought about it.</p><p><em> Stupid oversight.</em> I hadn't sensed him come in either, because children that young barely had any chakra at all. I should have at least <em> heard</em> him. The only explanation was that I hadn't been paying enough attention.</p><p>Which was really, really dumb. And it just proved, not all the danger in the world was bandits or missing nin. Everyday life had it's own troubles.</p><p>Of course, Naruto shouldn't have goddamn left the kid alone. Not even for a bathroom break. There were four of us here, ferchrissakes! I stowed that thought. I'd talk to him once the mission was over.</p><p>I threw together lunch and carted it out to the dinning room table before making sure that everything was safely put away in the kitchen. The last thing I wanted was a repeat occurrence.</p><p>"Lunch is ready," I said softly moving into the lounge. Naruto was sulking on the couch and Sasuke was kneeling awkwardly on the ground, obviously being lectured on the intricacies of playing with action figures. He was so obviously out of his comfort zone that it was almost funny.</p><p>Action figures which got quickly abandoned at the call to food. "Lunch!" Shinji echoed looking delighted. Sasuke looked deeply relieved to have escaped.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon went much more smoothly. Councillor Hideaki came home right on time and looked pleased to find his son down for his afternoon nap. He did mutter something about the wisdom of hiring ninja under his breath, which we politely ignored, but it did make me wonder if he'd had problems before.</p><p>We were on the way back to the Hokage's Tower to collect our mission pay when Naruto exploded. I was surprised he'd stayed quiet so long; Sasuke must have said something serious to get him to stay quiet. Sensei was still mostly ignoring us.</p><p>"Alright! Now you have to explain, bastard! Where the hell do you think you get off telling me what to do, huh?"</p><p>Sasuke sneered. "The client was almost injured because of your incompetence!"</p><p>Naruto looked taken back and slightly hurt. "What the hell are you talking about?" He barked. "The kid was fine. I only left him alone for a minute!"</p><p>"Which you shouldn't have!" Sasuke shot back.</p><p>"Naruto, Shinij wandered into the kitchen and nearly tipped a pot of boiling water on himself. He could have been seriously hurt," I explained, trying to stay calm. "It's true that I should have been paying more attention myself, but I thought I could trust you to keep an eye on him. If you needed to leave, you should have called Sasuke."</p><p>Naruto deflated like a popped balloon. I ignored the stab of guilt that that caused in favour of my anger at his carelessness. We didn't speak again; it seemed like all our progress from the morning had been erased.</p><p>When I went home I grabbed my sealing book, found Shika - watching clouds, no surprise - and curled up into his side.</p><p>"What's up?" he asked casually.</p><p>"What makes you think something is up?" I queried.</p><p>"You're only this touchy feely when you're upset," he answered. "And, it's troublesome, but if there's something…"</p><p>I smiled softly. "Just a team argument," I said, going back to my book. The morning had shown me that my chakra reserves, in proportion to what I actually used in a fight, weren't all that great. I knew if <em> was </em> possible to make a chakra storage seal, but of course, possible didn't mean easy. They were almost the very opposite of easy. It would take me years to actually create one. Until then, I'd have to build my reserves the old fashioned way. I sighed.</p><p>So much to do.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Graduation Arc: Chapter 8</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert</p><p>Author's notes: If there's anyone familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist in the audience, you might notice that my explanation for sealing seems similar to the explanation for alchemy. I did in fact base it a little on that. The two seem similar to me, so I hope I explained it in a way that meshes with Naruto-verse.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 8</p><p><hr /></p><p>"<em> Coincidence is the word we use when we can't see the levers and pulleys." ~ Emma Bull</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I sat on the edge of the bank, carefully positioning my feet on the water. The river in the training field was slow moving, almost a pond, and nearly perfect to try to learn to walk on water.</p><p>Water had natural surface tension and would resists the efforts of anything trying to break through. Of course, that only went so far and anything heavier than an insect couldn't really take advantage of it. What the water walking technique was supposed to do was use chakra to enhance that natural surface tension to support human weight. It went deeper than that, though. You needed to keep it solid to balance on and anchored to avoid washing away with the current.</p><p>My chakra control was more than good enough for it but the feeling of standing on something so unstable took some getting used to. It was a reflexive reaction to channel more chakra to make the platform more stable but it really had the opposite reaction and shattered the delicate chakra balance sending you splashing down into the water.</p><p>Channelling chakra through your feet was supposedly one of the most difficult ways of channelling chakra. That was because most people moulded chakra in the Hara, the centre of energies located near the stomach, and then transported it through the body to the point they wanted to emit it. This required them to keep tight control over the moulded energy or risk losing or wasting energy as it travelled. Maybe it was because I was so much more in tune with my chakra pathways but I found it just as easy to mould it at my feet where I needed to use it.</p><p>I stood, wobbling slightly from the feel of the water underfoot. It felt… squishy, like standing on thick jello. I knew intellectually that it was stable, but it didn't feel it. I stepped forward. Disconnect the chakra. Reconnect. Test the weight. Step again. Each step was a little more certain, a little steadier, a little easier. Water Walking, like Cat Foot or Leaping Monkey, was one of the skills that became, <em> needed</em> to become, second nature. When you needed to use it, you couldn't be thinking about it.</p><p>I jumped, a slight bounce, then higher, then higher again. I darted to the side, zigzagged back, using the chakra on my feet to counterbalance the action and pivot neatly. I loosened the anchoring aspect and slid across the water like I was skating. I suppressed a giggle. It was fun.</p><p>"Whoa!" Came an appreciative shout from the bank. "That's so cool! Can you teach me that? Please, Shikako? Please?"</p><p>I skidded back onto the back, where Naruto was standing waving his arms about. He and Sasuke had apparently shown up while I was busy experimenting. I flushed.</p><p>"Ah, sure, I guess," I said. I hadn't intended to teach them but there wasn't any reason not to. "Umm… But we'll have to start with the first stage." I added hastily as it looked like Naruto was about to dive head first into the river. It might have been spring but it was still too cold to spend the day soaking wet.</p><p>I walked towards the trees that edged the clearing. Naruto and, unsurprisingly, Sasuke followed me. Even though he hadn't said anything he was undeniably interested in learning.</p><p>"The first step, before Water Walking, is Tree Walking," I started, looking at Naruto to make sure he was listening. He was. Eagerly. "It requires good chakra control. You use your chakra to grip the tree." I reached out and touched a hand to the tree bark. "Do you see how the bark on the tree is uneven? You fill in the gaps with your chakra to grab onto it. The deeper into the tree you can get it, the more solid your grip. But, if you use too much chakra it can blow the tree apart. If you don't use enough you just wont stick."</p><p>Trees were actually easy to use to learn this technique because they had such a rough surface. Rock would probably work too, but flying stone shrapnel was probably a little more dangerous. The same principle applied with everything else, but at a much more minute level. I walked a few steps up the tree before jumping off, to Naruto's amazement.</p><p>"To actually Tree Walk, you channel chakra out your feet to stick to the tree, but it might be easier if you start with your hands." I demonstrated, moulding chakra in my hand before sticking it to the tree in front of me. "Less chance of falling off, that way."</p><p>"Awesome!" Naruto exclaimed. "I'll totally get this down before sensei gets here!"</p><p>I smiled at his enthusiasm, but doubted it. Not unless he used his Shadow Clone training…</p><p>"Hey Naruto," I asked slowly. How could I bring this up? "What does it feel like when your Shadow Clones pop?"</p><p>Naruto frowned at the weird question. "What do you mean?"</p><p>"Well," I tried to explain. "there are a lot of different types of clones, right? The Clone Jutsu we learnt at the Academy require direct manipulation - you had to keep thinking about what you wanted it to do - while some other types of Clones can carry out a basic plan like Water or Earth Clones. But your Shadow Clones seem to be autonomous - they think for themselves. I was just wondering how… how you controlled them, I guess. How it feels."</p><p>Sasuke was actually listening intently to us, even as he attempted to stick his hand to the tree.</p><p>Naruto frowned again. "I don't know. I never thought about it." He scratched the back of his head. "They do what I'm thinking when I make them but if I come up with a new plan I can sort of tell them it. Not in words but like… the idea."</p><p>"Huh." I hadn't expected that. I guess it made sense though. "And do you get things back from them?"</p><p>"I don't know," he confessed.</p><p>"Well, if you make one now and I tell it something then if you know what I told it…"</p><p>"Yeah! That's a cool idea, Shikako!" Naruto clapped his hands into a Ram Seal and with an explosion of chakra there were two of him standing in front of me.</p><p>"Right. You keep working on the Tree Walking, and we'll go over there," I said pointing back at the bridge. It was far enough away that they shouldn't be able to hear us.</p><p>"Uh, right," I said to the clone. It really was an exact copy of Naruto. Without having seen it made I would never have been able to tell the two apart, not even using my chakra sense. "Lets see… maybe if I just give you some code words?"</p><p>The Naruto grinned. "Hehe, that sounds awesome. Just like Iruka-sensei always talked about in the Academy."</p><p>"He'll be delighted to learn you were actually listening," I said dryly, drawing a blank about any code words I could possibly use. "Okay. Bridge, blue and thirteen." They weren't the most original choices, given where we were standing, but hey. I wasn't trying to fool anyone here.</p><p>"Bridge, blue, thirteen," the Naruto repeated. "Err… what should I do?"</p><p>"I don't know," I said honestly. "Can you try and … send it to him?"</p><p>His face squinched up in heavy concentration.</p><p>I waited. And waited.</p><p>"Maybe we should ask Naruto if he's got it?" I wondered.</p><p>We headed back towards Naruto just in time to see the bark crackle under his hand and send him staggering back a few steps. "Hehe, I'm still working on it," he assured me.</p><p>I winced, but nodded. "Do you know what I told your clone?" I asked.</p><p>Naruto thought about it. "Not a clue."</p><p>I nearly face palmed. "Alright. What if he pops?" With a shrug, the clone did just that, dispersing in a puff of chakra smoke.</p><p>Naruto looked frozen. "Bridge. Blue. Thirteen," he recited. "That's what you told him, right?"</p><p>I smiled. "That's what I told him."</p><p>"That's so cool!" Naruto exclaimed. "How the heck didn't I notice this before? Oh man, I can think of so many things…" he giggled.</p><p>I didn't want to know. "Like helping with your training?" I asked.</p><p>"Helping with my training?" he parroted, showing that that had <em> not</em> been what he was thinking.</p><p>"Just a thought." I shrugged. "But you know what they say. Two heads are better than one and all that."</p><p>I turned away from him. Sasuke had moved on from using his hands to starting climbing. There weren't any great holes in his tree, so I assumed that his chakra control in his hands was fairly decent. It was considerably worse through his feet. Without the momentum of running at the tree, he was only making a few steps before either sliding or being repelled. I considered his progress.</p><p>"Hn?"</p><p>I shrugged. "You've got the gist of it. The only thing left is practice." I considered suggesting that he run at the tree, but the speed didn't really do anyone any favours. It only meant you were higher up when your control faltered. "Unless you have questions?"</p><p>He shook his head and turned back to his tree.</p><p>I went back to the river. Sensei wouldn't be here for ages and I could still use practice.</p><p>"Well, well, well. Aren't you busy little bees?"</p><p>I turned back to the bridge, where sensei was perched on the railings. I glanced at the sun, pushing a hank of slightly sweaty hair out of my face. It was probably close to eleven.</p><p>"You're late!" Came a chorus of voices, all Naruto. They exploded in a huge messy cloud of chakra smoke, leaving only one behind.</p><p>Sasuke flipped gracefully off the tree trunk he had been standing on. Neither of them had made a great deal of progress but they'd only been working for about two hours. I skated towards the bank and we all converged on the bridge around Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>He was peering at us as though we had done something very interesting and unexpected. "Mah, it looks like you've been entertaining yourselves while you waited."</p><p>"Hey!" Naruto squawked. "Did you even hear me? You're late!"</p><p>Predictably, Kakashi-sensei ignored him.</p><p>There was a long moment of silence. Kakashi-sensei seemed to want us to say something, but I was baffled as to what he was asking.</p><p>"Well, lets go get a mission, then!" He said cheerfully, hopping off the railings.</p><p>"It better not be as sucky as yesterday," Naruto complained grumpily.</p><p>I shrugged. I didn't really care about D-ranks. It wasn't as though I'd never gone shopping or weeded a garden or babysat before either. "At least we're getting paid for it," I offered. "And they don't take long."</p><p>"But they're not even actual missions!" Naruto argued.</p><p>"You heard Hokage-sama yesterday," I said. "They'll give us an 'actual' mission once we've done a few D-ranks."</p><p>"Oh, <em> that's</em> what he was saying." Naruto nodded sagely. "We'll just do these stupid missions really fast so we can get to a proper mission."</p><p>If you ignored the wording, it was a good plan.</p><p>Naruto ended up selecting our mission for the day, which was a courier mission because 'it sounded fastest'. He even ended up explaining his whole plan of doing D-ranks really quickly so that the Hokage would give him an important mission. I would have been horribly embarrassed, but the Hokage just looked amused at him. I guess it was a step up from having him complain.</p><p>We went up three levels in the tower and were directed to a stack of papers nearly taller than Naruto was. Even Kakashi-sensei seemed nonplussed.</p><p>"Here's the list of where they need to be delivered. And a map," the Chunin at the desk said, with a quick smile. "The files all have a number corresponding to the delivery location. Any questions?"</p><p>"Alright! Let's go!" Naruto cheered, attempting to pick the entire pile up. I could see it tipping over and going <em> everywhere.</em></p><p>"Wait!" I yelped. "We should take a quarter each… a third each," I amended as I turned to find Kakashi-sensei gone like the wind.</p><p>Sasuke was already examining the map and list. "To the Academy first," he decided. "It's closest."</p><p>We divided the pile up and trundled off.</p><p>"That… was exhausting," Naruto said later as we returned to the Mission Assignment desk to report a 'mission complete'. We had literally gone all over the village, the Academy, the Hospital, the Library, weapons shops… just about everywhere that dealt with shinobi <em> anything</em> .</p><p>"Yeah," I said as Sasuke grunted in agreement. It was only mid afternoon. "Did you guys want to spar? Since we didn't this morning and all…"</p><p>Sasuke hesitated, then shook his head. "I want to work on the Tree Walking some more."</p><p>Naruto watched Sasuke leave and seemed torn. "Umm. I want to spar. But… I want to master that technique. If Sasuke is going to… I can't be left behind."</p><p>I pondered for a second. Actual combat was something I needed to work on. "Could you… get some Shadow Clones to work on it, and train with me at the same time?"</p><p>"Oh! Yeah! I totally forgot about that! Let's go!"</p><p>I smiled and followed him back to the training grounds.</p><p>That was how most of our first week as Genin went with a small variation as to the kind of missions we took. After training I'd go home and continue my own projects. Mostly, that week, I was working on seals.</p><p>Sealing, or the art of Fuinjutsu, is one of the least studied areas of the ninja arts. To be successful at sealing one needs to understand the forces that they are attempting to work with - the properties of your materials, the energy flows, and how chakra will interact with them. In this way it can be considered similar to medical ninjutsu, however, unlike medical ninjutsu there are so many more factors to take into account not just the human body. Even those who are good at one type of sealing may never succeed in another area, simply for lack of information.</p><p>But to succeed in sealing, you must also have a 'natural talent' for manipulating energy. Some seals are powered not just by the individuals chakra, but by ambient chakra in the air. Natural chakra.</p><p>There are many different sealing theories, many which even contradict each other. Some sealers used nothing more than Kanji, others said nothing could be down without complex and estoric signs - including astrological signs, symbolic images or lines of text. Some sealers go by the Five Elements (wind, water, fire, earth and lightning), or the Eight Trigrams (sky, marsh, fire, lightning, wind, water, mountain and earth) while others go by the Three States (solid, gas and liquid) or Three Treasures (Budda, Dharma and Sangha) or Yin-and-Yang and others still invent their own tenets.</p><p>Some sealers claim that circles are the basis of all seals. That the redistibution of energy, be it chakra or otherwise, must be cyclic.</p><p><em> Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, merely changed from one form to another.</em></p><p>In cyclic sealing, the circle itself is the conduit that focuses and dictates the flow of energy and allows it to be manipulated. A subset of cyclic sealing is spiral seals which are much more powerful - and unstable. Unsurprisingly, these were most famously used by Uzushiro.</p><p>A completely different form of sealing is triangular sealing. Triangles are widely regarded as the strongest and most stable shapes, so are a natural resource for powerful seals. Triangles can be combined in many different ways to form other shapes, and a hexagram is commonly used because it forms eight multidirectional triangles.</p><p>There was the arithmetical approach. Runic based sealing. Pictorial seals, which were, I suspected, what Sai used. Geometrical seals. And many, many more.</p><p>Seals usually involve repeating elements. Prime numbers are common, particularly three, five and seven.</p><p>Blood is often used, or blood mixed with ink, because it is an excellent conductor and container for chakra.</p><p>This much, I had been able to discover. Beyond that, beyond the 'hows', the '<em> whys</em> ' were … vague.</p><p>I frowned at my notebook (triple encrypted, with one layer being English which I was almost sure no one spoke) in consternation. I'd already raided the Konoha Library for sealing books at my access level, of which there aren't many. What there were focused more on the forces involved sealing - the combustion potential in exploding tags, for instance - rather than the principles behind the seals themselves. It was perfectly possible to just copy existing seals, as long as you just wanted to duplicate the same effects. Creating your own, now that was another story.</p><p>Maybe if I compared the major branches of sealing, I'd be able to uncover the principles behind the seals? It seemed as good a place to start as any.</p><p>With a sigh, I took out a new notebook and began.</p><p>It was Saturday when our schedule changed. Ninja didn't exactly have a 'working week'. We worked when there was work to do, and took breaks when we were tired, injured or not pressed for money.</p><p>On Saturday, we turned up bright and early at the mission assignment desk for a surprising announcement from the Hokage.</p><p>"Well now. Team Seven has been surprisingly productive," the Hokage said, peering at us. "What do you say, Kakashi? Are they ready for a C-rank mission?"</p><p>Naruto exploded with cheers.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei smiled. "Well, they're certainly enthusiastic for one."</p><p>The Hokage chuckled. "A C-rank mission it is, then. You'll be bodyguards on a journey to the Land of Waves."</p><p>Well. <em> Shit.</em></p><p>That was something I'd been unconsciously trying to avoid. For it to happen anyway felt a little like fate.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert</p><p>Author's notes: I haven't found much information of distances in Naruto, but I do have a picture map.

Sasuke just looked interested.</p><p>"Who? Who? Will we be guarding a princess? Or some councillor?" Naruto asked, bouncing up and down with excitement.</p><p>"Don't be so impatient," the Hokage chuckled. "I will bring him in now." He raised his voice. "Send in our visitor."</p><p>To the side of the missions assignment desk was a small lounge where the prospective clients waited while the missions were handed out or completed. It kept them contained and out of the way, yet close at hand, and was a fairly efficient system. It was staffed at all times by several Chunin, which were, I assumed, who the Hokage was talking to.</p><p>The door slid open, allowing us the first glimpse of our client… and him the first glimpse of us.</p><p>"What the-? A bunch of little snot nosed brats." He drank deeply from his bottle, Adams apple bobbing rapidly.</p><p>Tazuna was… old. Maybe forty, which in ninja terms was ancient. His hair and beard were dark grey but messy and unkempt. His clothes were neat but worn and a little dusty from the road. His glasses were plain, but the fact he even had them at all spoke of at least past wealth and status. The sake bottle in his hand was cheap stuff that was popular with some of the younger shinobi. He looked nervous. Scared. That wasn't unusual. People didn't hire ninja because they felt safe. But it was at a level out of proportion for bandits or wild animals. Even for civilians, that kind of threat is a constant background knowledge - it doesn't inspire terror.</p><p>"And you, the short one with the idiotic look on your face, you expect me to believe you're a ninja?"</p><p>Like most people who met Naruto, I expect he was talking about the orange. Or Orange. It probably deserved a capital letter. Civilians have odd expectations for ninja. They expect us to dress in black, wear masks, and carry lots of weaponry. In short, they expect us to look like ANBU. Which is ironic, because to civilians, ANBU don't exist and they certainly don't take missions.</p><p>To a civilian bright, blinding orange wasn't an appropriate colour for a ninja. Therefore, it was actually a perfect colour for a ninja. Oh, sure, it stood out like hell in a forest, but the fact was, most of our time spent hiding wasn't among trees - it was among <em> other people</em> . The best ninja is the one you can't tell from a civilian.</p><p>It confounded their expectations. A tall guy dressed head to toe in black carrying a small armoury? Ninja. Small, loud blond kid in orange? Are you kidding? Ninja were invisible not because of jutsu (most of the time) but because they looked just like normal people.</p><p>That was the whole point. Even the standard Jounin-Chunin 'uniform' looked like normal civilian clothes. It took someone familiar with ninja to recognise the flack jacket as something other than a vest. And frankly, a fellow ninja was more likely to recognise your chakra than your clothes.</p><p>That was a good thing when dealing with enemies. However, apparently, it made it a little difficult for clients to take you seriously. I winced but Naruto laughed. I knew he was able to shrug off cold looks but taunts usually got to him. Maybe he was growing.</p><p>"Who's he talking about? Who's the short one with - hey! I'll demolish him!"</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei snagged the back of Naruto's jacket. "You can't attack the client. It doesn't work like that."</p><p>I cast a look around. Sasuke looked exasperated. Iruka had his face hidden in his hands. The Hokage, however, just looked amused. Amused and watchful.</p><p>Not exactly a great first impression.</p><p>"I am Tazuna, a master bridge builder and I must return to my country," his voice held a rather stilted quality, as though he'd rehearsed this introduction before. His grip on his sake bottle was tight, and his eyes were bouncing over the three of us nervously. "I'm building a bridge that will change our world and I expect you to get me there safely, even if it costs you your lives."</p><p>Now that was rather presumptuous and a little insulting. He was questioning our loyalty as Konoha ninja, even if he didn't realise it.</p><p>"We are ninja of Konoha," I spoke levelly. "When we accept a mission, we do our best to see that it is fulfilled… provided the mission parameters are a true and accurate rendition of information."</p><p>He gulped. Definitely a sign of nervous behaviour.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei's hand landed lightly on my head. Approval or warning? I couldn't tell. But he must have noticed the reaction that that statement provoked. Maybe he had a plan.</p><p>"Mah, I wouldn't worry, Tazuna," Kakashi-sensei drawled. "Even if my students are only Genin, I am a Jounin, an elite ninja of Konoha."</p><p>And that did calm him down. A bit anyway.</p><p>"Alright, kids," Kakashi-sensei said, turning to us and unrolling the mission scroll I hadn't even seen him receive. "This is going to be a fairly long mission. Wave Country is located to the east of the Land of Fire, and we're going to be travelling at civilian pace, so I'd estimate it will take us about a week to get there. Our mission also includes guarding the bridge and workers as they complete the bridge which will take several more weeks. Remember that when you're packing for the mission." He smiled at us. "Lets meet at the main gate in two hours. That should give you all enough time to get ready."</p><p>"Yes, sensei," we chorused with varying degrees of enthusiasm.</p><p>I headed home, vaguely troubled. What could I remember about the Wave mission? Tazuna had had ninja after him, hired by the crime lord? Shipping company? By someone powerful anyway. There had been an ambush on the road, and Zabuza and Haku later on. I remembered those two. They had had a big impact on Naruto.</p><p>And they had died.</p><p>I shook my head. It would be nice to think I could save them, but I couldn't plan for that. There were too many things I didn't know and couldn't plan for. They had been betrayed, I remembered, but how and why were questions I couldn't answer. And if I couldn't answer them, then I couldn't convince anyone else, even <em> had</em> I been able to get the message to them. Besides, a missing-nin like Zabuza probably spent most of his time <em> expecting</em> to be betrayed.</p><p>Add to that, I didn't know them. If it came down to us verses them, I'd chose us in a heartbeat.</p><p>Shikamaru was still home when I got back. Either his team hadn't started for the day, or they had the day off. Either option was equally likely, frankly.</p><p>"Back already?" He asked, yawning. "They didn't have anything for you to do?"</p><p>I shook my head. "I have to pack. We have a C-rank."</p><p>"You have a C-rank already?" Shikamaru looked at me incredulously.</p><p>Mum popped out of the kitchen, frowning. "What's this I hear about a C-rank?"</p><p>"My team was given a C-rank," I said. "Several weeks long, so I need to pack."</p><p>"It's far too soon!" She fussed. "You've only been a Genin for a week. What are they thinking?"</p><p>A very good question. "I'll be fine," I reassured her, not wanting to admit I had my own doubts. I couldn't back out so I had to press forwards.</p><p>She nodded and sighed. "Yes, I suppose you will. It is only a C-rank. And you have been training hard." She rounded on Shikamaru. "You hear that, young man? Your sister is already taking C-ranks! You better step up your training. If they send you out like you are now -"</p><p>I winced and slipped up the stairs. Shikamaru was probably going to get hell while I was gone. I shuddered to think what mum would be like when she heard about what actually happened on this mission.</p><p>Assuming I made it back to tell her.</p><p><em> Stop it, </em> I thought sternly. <em> There's no need for that. Positive thinking.</em></p><p>If you went on a mission thinking it was going to fail, you had already failed. Mindset was important.</p><p>I breathed in, breathed out, centred myself and started packing. Like all good little ninja, I had most of my mission gear already packed; it just had to be customised for each mission. Most of it, I kept in sealing scrolls, but it wasn't a good idea to keep everything in one scroll. If it got destroyed or lost then I could potentially lose everything. Besides, an empty backpack attracted attention. I filled it with an extra set of clothes, a book to read and ration packs. For a mission like this, we'd probably be able to hunt for food, but I'd rather have too much food than not enough.</p><p>I added a much more comprehensive medical kit than I would usually take, several soldier pills and an excess of weaponry. Then I stopped, because there was a point where caution became paranoia.</p><p>I refilled my kunai pouch, made sure they were sharpened, changed into clean clothes, checked my bindings and tromped back downstairs with backpack on. Mum was waiting at the foot of the stairs. She was the one who had taught me how to pack for missions, but I didn't begrudge her double checking me. I'd rather she pointed it out if I <em> had</em> missed something.</p><p>But she just sighed. "Oh, do take care, wont you?" she asked.</p><p>"I will," I promised. "Tell dad I said bye." I'd have liked to go find him and say goodbye myself, but he was usually busy all day with important Jounin Commander-y things at the Tower. "And you tell Ino where I've gone," I said to Shika, poking him in the shoulder.</p><p>"Troublesome," he groaned. "That'll just make her want a C-rank mission." But he'd do it, if only because Ino would nag him until he told her.</p><p>"Alright," I said. Then again, more firmly. "Alright. I'll see you later!"</p><p>The Main Gate was the main entrance to Konoha. Most civilians thought it was the only gate but that wasn't quite true. It was just that the others were used only by specific people (I.e. ANBU), for secretive missions, and never, ever with civilians. So we were stuck travelling the out the Main Gate, probably all the way to the nearest town before we could branch off east. The forests around Konoha were thick and dangerous and heavily patrolled. By ourselves we'd be able to manage, but not with Tazuna.</p><p>Wave Country was directly off the east coast of the Land of Fire. Konoha was located almost exactly in the middle of the Land of Fire, so we had a fair way to travel to the coast. Still, there was a major Port City slightly north of where the Wave Bridge was being built, so there were plenty of well kept roads towards the coast. We probably wouldn't be travelling cross country, so it should be a fairly smooth trip.</p><p>Naruto was already at the gate when I arrived, practically bouncing with excitement. I quizzed him to make sure he had packed correctly, since I wouldn't put it past him to bring nothing but ramen cups. I know they say you turn into your parents eventually, but I hadn't expected the metamorphosis to be so quick.</p><p>"What's taking that teacher of yours so long?" Tazuna grumbled.</p><p>"Eh, Kakashi-sensei is always late," Naruto said, rolling his eyes. "We'll probably be as old and grey as you by the time he gets here." Apparently, Naruto <em> hadn't</em> forgotten Tazuna's earlier slight against him.</p><p>"What was that, you brat?" Tazuna scowled. "No respect. Pah."</p><p>"Well, it's lovely to see everyone getting on so well," Kakashi-sensei said brightly, as Tazuna and Naruto glared at each other. "If everyone is ready, we can go."</p><p>"We were waiting for <em> you</em> ," Naruto said resentfully, then seemed to forget all about it. His ability to change moods was rather remarkable. "Alright! This is the first time I've ever left the village! I'm a traveller now. A real ninja! This is going to be so great!"</p><p>I had been outside Konoha before on clan business. Dad had taken Shika and I with him to visit some of the outer Nara farms. Outside Konoha was… forests and farmlands with the occasional village. Hardly exciting. But Naruto was so excited and even Sasuke was looking alert. I held my tongue. There was no point in needlessly antagonising anyone, especially not when it looked like we were going to be stuck together for the next month or so.</p><p>We walked. It was a pleasant day with bright sunshine and light wind but our pace was slow to match Tazuna. Frankly, it was rather dull. To alleviate my boredom I asked Tazuna questions, not pointed ones, but generally about Wave Country. How big was it? Were there many towns? What were it's main exports?</p><p>Tazuna was seemingly willing to answer everything. Wave Country consisted of a series of linked islands, and people were fairly spread out amongst them. There were only one or two main towns but because the islands weren't very big most people didn't live very far from one or the other. The main food source for the island was, of course, fishing, though with Gatou Shipping companies controlling the waters many of the fishing boats had been grounded, leading food shortage. The Shipping company also charged high tariffs for food brought over from the mainland so the common people couldn't afford to import food. It was a very dire situation. Which was, Tazuna said, why the bridge he was building was so very important.</p><p>His conviction was obvious. I was a little surprised that he was so willing to tell us all about it. The only thing he seemed to be holding back was that there <em> were</em> ninja after him. Which made me wonder if he knew, or if he only suspected there might be. Had he truly known before the ambush on the road? As I had already noted, civilians weren't exactly adept at spotting ninja. Even claims that Gatou had hired ninja could be bluffs or scare tactics. Ninja weren't cheap to hire. Missing nin might be cheaper but they were harder to find and less trustworthy. A keen business man wouldn't waste money keeping one on retainer when mercenaries would do. It seemed more likely that Gatou would hire ninja in response to <em> Tazuna</em> hiring ninja.</p><p>We stopped to set up camp around an hour before dusk. Even though none of us were tired, Tazuna looked grateful for the break, and it meant that we had light available when we set up camp. We could do it in the dark - theoretically - but it <em> was</em> our first overnight mission and I was sure we'd end up in a hopeless tangle if we tried. Kakashi-sensei talked us through procedure, to make sure we knew what we were doing, and sent us on our way.</p><p>Naruto was to set up a perimeter wire and scout for hazards. Sasuke was to hunt for some dinner. And I was to clear the area and start a fire. He was going to stay with the client.</p><p>I swept the small clearing we had chosen for debris, moving rocks and stones and setting aside twigs and broken branches for the fire. I dug up a square of turf, careful to keep the packed together and the grass attached, and set it to the side. Tomorrow, that would go back down into the fire pit, hopefully erasing all traces that we had been here. Just how we'd been taught at the Academy. A good ninja left no signs of their passing.</p><p>Then I went looking for firewood. There was plenty to be found, with this many trees about. I didn't even bother cutting down branches, just picked up what was broken and abandoned on the ground. Old dry wood would burn better than live, green stuff, anyway.</p><p>By the time I had the fire going, Naruto had returned from trap setting and Sasuke was back with what looked like two rabbits and some kind of pheasant, all skinned, plucked and disembowelled.</p><p>I eyed them for a second. That was another thing we had been taught at the Academy in our survival classes. How to hunt, kill and prepare our own food. The first time, we'd had an overnight camp on one of the forested training fields. The teachers had treated it so cavalierly that the kids hadn't even thought anything of it. They'd just been excited, because we'd been given <em> real</em> kunai to hunt with and were getting to hunt <em> real </em> animals. A few girls had 'eww'ed at having to skin and clean their kills and a few boys had discovered that organs were squishy and <em> great</em> to throw at people but by the end of the night we had all been eating dinner that we had killed, prepared and cooked ourselves. It had been, probably one of the biggest steps in our desensitisation program and it had gone off without a hitch.</p><p>From the perspective of an outsider, it was horrifying. From the perspective of one of the students, I had been glad that I'd caught a rabbit because it was less work than plucking a bird.</p><p>I shook the thought off and handed Sasuke the stakes I had prepared. He took them with a short nod.</p><p>"Not bad for a first effort," Kakashi-sensei said, not looking up from his book. "Took you three a bit long, but that will come with practise."</p><p>"Yes, sensei," I said obediently, unsealing my sleeping bag and positioning it by Naruto. We weren't using tents because the weather was fair and there was no expectation of rain, and because they were bulky and added a lot of weight to a pack. I had one sealed away, of course, but most Genin didn't even carry one.</p><p>Dinner was a quiet affair. We set up a rotating watch and retreated to our sleeping bags. Naruto on first watch, Sasuke with the unenviable middle watch and myself with the dawn watch. I slept lightly in what most ninja called 'mission sleep', deep enough to rest, light enough to spring to attention at need.</p><p>We'd also learnt this on that camping mission. The Chunin instructors had crept about radiating killing intent and gleefully dumped cold water over everyone. Those who hadn't been able to avoid it were given extra laps to run in the morning. It hadn't exactly been pleasant. I hadn't woken at the killing intent, but it had invaded my dreams something awful and the cold water had been more of a relief than anything.</p><p>Morning watch was cold and dark and lonely, but necessary, so I kept staring out into the darkness, stretching out with my chakra, listening for signs of intruders. There was nothing, which was what you want when you're on watch, but boring all the same.</p><p>Breakfast was a much more energetic affair. Sleep had apparently recharged Naruto to such an extent that he really couldn't sit still. Since we had a long way to travel and wanted to break camp quickly, we ate ration bars for breakfast instead of hunting.</p><p>"Ne, ne, Shikako! What's that? Those aren't the kind they sell in the supermarket!" Naruto pointed out, comparing his cheap brand ration bar to what I was holding.</p><p>I glanced down. "Oh. We get these from the Akimichi in exchange for medicines and ingredients. They make their own food packs."</p><p>There was a lot of trade between our three clans. The Ino-Shika-Cho just symbolised the closeness that already existed, it wasn't the limit of it. The Akimichi food pills were actually the result of combined efforts from all three clans - Nara research, Yamanaka herbs and Akimichi technique. I had studied them. A lot.</p><p>For ninja clans our three clans had a lot of seemingly civilian sidelines. The Akimichi owned a dozen restaurants, several produce farms, a few orchards and even an apiary - a bee farm.</p><p>Of the three clans it was the Akimichi who were undeniably the biggest. Before the pact between us, many, many generations ago, the Nara and Yamanaka clans had been vassals to the Akimichi. Their Taijutsu prowess made them capable of standing alone in battle in ways we couldn't. It was only with teamwork between the three of us that our clans were able to blossom into what we are today.</p><p>It would probably surprise a lot of people to know that the Akimichi were highly integrated into the working of Konoha. They were one of the four noble founding clans, along with the Aburame, the Hyuuga and the Uchiha.</p><p>"Akimichi? That's … Chouji's family, isn't it?" Naruto said, puzzled.</p><p>"Yes," I said. "The Akimichi place high value on proper nutrition, so they make a lot of their own food."</p><p>"They taste better too," Kakashi said dryly. I didn't blame him, field rations were famous for being less than tasty. Nutritious but… well.</p><p>"That too," I agreed.</p><p>We broke camp easily, repacking our sleeping bags and filling in the fire pit. It wasn't perfect, and if you looked you could tell we'd been there, but it wasn't immediately obvious.</p><p>Then we started walking. About mid morning I started noticing chakra in the trees. It took me a while to notice it as something out of the ordinary - in Konoha there are always people in the trees. But we were out of Konoha now and there was no one around us.</p><p>"What are you so twitchy about, girl?" Tazuna demanded, sounding mighty nervous himself. I didn't think it was a good idea to say that I thought I was sensing ninja in the trees.</p><p>"Just trying to identify the trees," I said mildly. "I'm not very good at botany. I think that one is a redwood." Not very good at trees anyway. Fruit trees were easy to identify by their fruit, and berries were usually on bushes and shrubs. Herbs and other plants with useful functions were generally a lot smaller.</p><p>"It is," Kakashi-sensei said, smiling. "And that's a cedar and that one is…"</p><p>"Fir," Sasuke half said, half grunted, joining in our impromptu guessing game.</p><p>"It's a lot different to Konoha," Naruto said, squinting at the trees.</p><p>"Mah, the forests in Konoha were planted specifically. Well, grown, anyway. A lot of the trees around Konoha don't belong in any known genus. I guess you could call them Hashirama trees."</p><p>"Hehehe, the First Hokage was so awesome he invented his own trees!" Naruto chortled.</p><p>"He also founded Konoha," Kakashi-sensei said dryly.</p><p>I was on high alert after noticing them. They weren't always following us; they came and they went and I wasn't sure it was always the same people. I paid close attention to where we were travelling and identified prime ambush sites along our route. Kakashi-sensei didn't seem fussed, or even give any idea that he'd noticed them, but watching him I saw that he circled our group, always placing himself in the area of highest danger. It was slow and subtle and appeared almost random but anyone who wanted to attack us would have to attack him first.</p><p>Still, for all my worrying, nothing happened until the sixth day. We'd made good time and we were bound to reach the coast by mid afternoon. So, of course, the ambush happened that morning.</p><p>The point they had chosen for the ambush was odd, considering they had been following us for so long. Maybe they were afraid of reinforcements from Konoha, maybe they were more familiar with the land closer to Wave Country, or maybe they wanted to make a statement to the people of Wave Country. We had passed several sites that would have been much better for an ambush; even several rivers if they required water to hide.</p><p>To be completely fair, I'm not sure I would have been able to spot the puddle as out of the ordinary if it hadn't been radiating so much chakra. I could easily see myself developing a huge reliance on my chakra sensing in future.</p><p>I softened the chakra silencing on my feet and let my steps falter into a statico of taps. At a casual glance, it was like I tripped. In reality, that pattern was code, meant to catch allied attention when they weren't looking at you.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei didn't look up from his book, but the fingers on his free hand flicked slightly in acknowledgement.</p><p><em> Foreign chakra, middle of path, 200 meters. </em> I signed, somewhat clumsily in Konoha standard sign language. <em> Possible jutsu/trap/ambush.</em></p><p>Naruto and Sasuke both sharpened to attention.</p><p><em> Specifics?</em> Kakashi-sensei signed back, hand tapping easily on his thigh.</p><p>I frowned, scanning deeper. If I could sense it, so could Kakashi, which meant this question was a test.</p><p><em> Multiple opponents. Greater than one, less than five. Upper Chunin level. </em> I conveyed. <em> Course of action?</em></p><p><em> Spring the trap,</em> Kakashi-sensei signed, making sure all three of us saw his hand move. <em> Primary mission objective.</em></p><p>The primary mission objective in this case was to protect Tazuna. We gravitated slowly into a triangular Manji formation around him, trying to make it look as though we were still walking casually. The two boys had tensed up noticeably - to a ninja, anyway - but Tazuna seemed unaware that anything had changed.</p><p>I can't say that I was perfectly calm myself. My heart was racing, my palms were sweaty and I had to purposefully control my breathing. Making myself walk into that trap, knowing there were enemies waiting, knowing we were going to be attacked, even knowing they expected us to be off guard, knowing I had backup, knowing there was <em> nothing I could do </em> to change this situation was possibly the hardest, most terrifying thing I'd ever done.</p><p>The puddle was on the ground, and the chakra signatures were within it. There were no other chakra signatures in the trees or surrounding area. At a casual glance, I couldn't see any traps, and there was no residual chakra from pre-cast or delayed jutsu. Given these factors, the enemies would need to explode from the ground to attack us. There were two ways they could do that for maximum advantage. One, when we were directly over them, thus penetrating our defensive structure, causing havoc and taking us off guard, or two, once we had passed over them, attacking us from behind when our backs were turned. Kakashi-sensei had gravitated to the back of the group, several steps behind the rest of us. If they popped up in the middle, he would be facing them, if they popped up behind us, he would be the first to be attacked.</p><p>Which option they chose probably depended upon how well they could observe us while hidden. If they could identify individuals, they'd probably go for option one. If they couldn't, if all they could tell was that the group was here or there then they'd have to go for option two.</p><p>I'd said there were between two and four possible enemies, but the closer we got, the more sure I was that there were only two.</p><p>I readied my shadow. It slid thickly over the ground at my feet as I walked on. The puddle was directly in front of us. It fairly reeked of chakra. One step. Two. Beside us now. I was ready. My third step carried me past it, in line with Tazuna. Four. Five. Six -</p><p>"Ha!" The puddle exploded outwards, launching two figures into the air. They were holding a rope? No. A spiked chain. They whirled it, and it wrapped around Kakashi-sensei. I felt the flair of chakra as he used the replacement jutsu and the secondary spike as he impressed an illusionary clone overtop of the log. Illusionary clones are technically an area of effect genjutsu, and I couldn't dispel it for myself without dispelling it for everyone. I ignored it.</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei!" Naruto cried in distress as it was ripped to pieces.</p><p>I slid in front of Tazuna. With my Shadow Jutsu, I was the one most suited for the role of bodyguard, and anyone who wanted to attack Tazuna had to get in my range.</p><p>"Naruto! Clones!" I snapped, even as Sasuke was already moving, throwing a brace of shuriken towards the two. With a weapon like that - and equally nasty claw gauntlets - distance attacks were the safer option.</p><p>Naruto snapped his hands up into a cross seal immediately, unthinkingly following orders. We'd only been training together for a week, mostly while waiting for Kakashi-sensei to show up, but it was enough to give us a familiarity with each other's style. Sparring like that wasn't a real fight, but it was closer than what we'd done at the Academy and it did mean that Naruto didn't freeze up right now.</p><p>"Stay at range. Have your clones fight in close," I ordered. I didn't want the real Naruto in range of those claws. Something tickled the back of my mind about why, but I didn't question my instincts.</p><p>The rush of clones provided cover for Sasuke, and shadows for me. The chain swept through the clones, but they provided a surprising amount of resistance, entangling it. I split my shadow into two spikes, each one arching slightly to the side of where the two nin where standing.</p><p>"Fire Release: Phoenix Flower Technique!" Sasuke cried, firing off a rapid set of small fireballs. I knew they contained shuriken concealed within them, and that Sasuke could direct them to a certain degree even after he had cast the jutsu.</p><p>The missing nin disengaged their chain and dived to the side, out of the pathway of Sasuke's jutsu… and straight into mine.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," I announced, fingers twisted into the rat seal that was customary for my jutsu. "Naruto? Rope?"</p><p>Even though they were paralysed, they still needed to be tied up or knocked out. I couldn't hold them forever.</p><p>"Not to worry," a cheery voice said, even as hands garbed in Konoha standard fingerless gloves gave precise chops to my captives necks. They sagged in my jutsu, and at sensei's nod, I gratefully released them. "Good teamwork, kids."</p><p>"Sensei!" Naruto yelped, twisting to look at the cut and shattered logs littering the road. The sheer relief on his face made me feel a twinge of guilt, even though there had been no way I could have told him during the fight. He had truly been worried. "You… but… a replacement jutsu!"</p><p>Tazuna seemed in shock. The ambush had been very quick, even for us. I imagine it was a lot worse for someone who hadn't been trained for it and hadn't even been expecting it. "If you were fine the whole time… why did you leave the kids to fight?"</p><p>Sensei's eye trained on him seriously. "Because," he said slowly, "I needed to see who they were trying to attack. Us - ninja attacking ninja - or you… hmm?"</p><p>Tazuna went white. I felt more sympathy for him than I expected. His recounting of what life was like in Wave Country at the moment had given me a fair bit of insight into his situation. The difference in price between a C-rank mission and an A-rank was about two zeros. Hiring ninja isn't exactly cheap.</p><p>Tazuna summarised what I had already pieced together, throwing in a half hearted sob story about his grandson.</p><p>"Well," Sensei said, scratching his chin through his mask. "That certainly exceeds our mission parameters." I was pretty sure I caught a flash of humour in his eye as he glanced at me, but I wasn't good enough at reading Kakashi-sensei's facial expressions to be sure. Possibly he was teasing me about my first reaction to Tazuna.</p><p>"No way!" Naruto yelped, catching on to what sensei was saying. "We can't quit the mission! What kind of ninja would we be then, if we quit just because it got difficult? Besides, we took these guys no problem! Bring it on!"</p><p>Sasuke nodded in agreement, determination writ in the lines of his face.</p><p>Sensei turned to me. "Well?" He asked.</p><p>I folded my hands into a 'thinking seal', all my fingers touching at the tips, and turned away from his probing gaze trying to order my thoughts. My gaze landed on our two unconscious opponents.</p><p>"Gozu and Meizu. The Demon Brothers. Chunin ranked missing nin from Mist," I said clinically, arranging the facts in my mind. Their bingo book page sprung to mind, giving me the information I had been instinctually acting on in combat. "Distinctive weaponry: retractable shuriken chain and gauntlets. Known to use poisons - mostly contact poisons on their weaponry, but they're also known to use gaseous poisons." Which explained why I didn't want the real Naruto getting close to them, and why they were wearing Mist standard breathing masks. "Highly skilled in teamwork manoeuvres they are known to commonly band together with stronger missing nin for protection. Therefore, it is highly likely that the next enemy we face will be much stronger."</p><p>I couldn't out and out state that our next opponent would be Zabuza Momochi. Bingo books didn't update frequently enough to have that kind of information, but he was a known associate of theirs.</p><p>"I ain't afraid," Naruto said. I wished I had his confidence. I <em> was</em> scared. We were going to be walking into a fight well out of our range. That was the thing I despised most of all, being helpless. I would have to rely solely on Kakashi to defend us.</p><p>Naruto and Sasuke had already voted to go on ahead. I was outnumbered anyway. I cast a considering gaze at Kakashi and bit my lip. Did I trust him that much? To protect us?</p><p>"Come on, Shikako," Naruto said impatient. "We took care of these guys no problem. We'll show the next guy not to mess with us too!" He clenched a fist and for a second, his inspirational nature shone through. I felt… like maybe we could do this.</p><p>Ah, hell. You don't get stronger without pushing yourself. We needed to get stronger, both individually and as a team. I would just have to trust Kakashi-sensei to catch us if we stumbled.</p><p>I dropped my hands and nodded. "Fine." No regrets now. After deciding on a course of action, looking back only got you killed.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Waves Arc: Chapter 10</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert</p><p>Author's note: You know, rewatching the Wave Arc is like 'what happened, Sasuke?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 10</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Fear makes the wolf bigger than he is ~ German Proverb. </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Tazuna had a boat waiting at the coast to ferry us across to the islands that made up the Land of Waves. It was an old paddle boat and given what Tazuna had told us about the Shipping Company, I assumed this was an 'illegal' trip out.</p><p>The fact that the point we left from was covered in fog so thick you could barely see a foot in front of your face only highlighted that feeling.</p><p>"The bridge is just ahead. It isn't far now," the boatman murmured, voice barely carrying to where I sat at the front of the boat. We sliced easily through the calm waters.</p><p>"Whoa! It's huge!" Naruto said, as the bridge loomed out of the fog. From this close, it really was impressive.</p><p>I flinched. "Shh!"</p><p>"Ooops, sorry," Naruto whispered, voice hushed.</p><p>We sailed under one of the bridges that connected the smaller islands. They had large archways, clearly designed to let boats pass through. It even had a strip of lights on the ceiling. On the other side, it was almost like a different world. The fog was gone, and the sun was shinning. I blinked a bit at sudden brightness, looking around. We were in a shallow bay, surrounded by houses the edged right out over the water. There were even trees growing in the water (mangroves? There weren't that many species of tree that would tolerate salt water). I assumed we were at high tide, or close to it at the moment.</p><p>The boat parked (docked?) next to one of the houses, allowing us to disembark. There was a walkway that extended from house to house, like a veranda, that was probably used as a dock. There didn't seem to be anyone around, or even any boats moored to the posts. It was a little eerie. Maybe they were all out?</p><p>This wasn't, apparently, the town where Tazuna lived, just the safest one for us to disembark at. We still had a fair distance to walk.</p><p>And I knew it wouldn't be long now. For all that I didn't trust my 'future knowledge', I was pretty damn sure that we'd run into Zabuza. There was no way anything I could have done would have affected that, not if everything else had happened.</p><p>We walked on, the docks giving way to housing giving way to forest. I was twitchy, constantly scanning the forest with both eyes and chakra. They boys were keeping a look out and the fact that Kakashi-sensei wasn't saying anything meant that he was worried too.</p><p>Then, suddenly, they were there. Chakra in the trees that was huge and intimidating and I knew without a doubt that we Genin could not match it. We were outclassed, a thousand times over. How could no one else feel that?</p><p>"Sensei?" I whispered, apprehensively.</p><p>"Get down!"</p><p>Something huge and metal arched out of the trees, whistling through the air. I snagged Tazuna in my shadow and hurled us both to the ground, even as Naruto and Sasuke mirrored me.</p><p>It crashed into the tree, biting deep into the wood. Then, with a blur of movement almost too fast to follow, there was a man standing on it.</p><p><em> Zabuza Momochi</em> .</p><p>He chuckled, the sound echoing menacingly. Intimidation tactics, part of my mind recognised dimly. That didn't stop it from working. It would have been a ridiculous opening if it hadn't been quite so terrifying.</p><p>"Well, well," Kakashi-sensei said casually, sounding neither surprised nor worried. His blasé attitude was strangely calming. "If it isn't Zabuza Momochi, rouge ninja from the Village Hidden in the Mist." The extra dialogue was probably for our benefit, since I didn't expect Naruto or Sasuke to recognise him. They hadn't even recognised <em> Kakashi</em> .</p><p>Sasuke looked like it was beginning to dawn on him just how much trouble we were in. His muscles were tensed and ready to spring into action, and his jaw was clenched shut. Naruto, on the other hand, looked like he was eager to attack. I caught his eye and signed, very slowly, <em> primary mission objective. </em></p><p>Protect Tazuna. It was a reminder he needed. He looked torn, but didn't leap forward. I counted that as a win. Naruto had handled himself well in the first ambush and didn't feel the overpowering urge to prove himself, but he was probably over confident because of it. Overconfident and ignorant.</p><p>Not really a good combination.</p><p>The three of us slid into a triangle formation around Tazuna. I took the side facing the chakra signature that I assumed was Haku. If he decided to attack, I was the only one who knew he was there. Not so happily, that put me with my back to Zabuza. I could still sense him but turning your back on someone like that seemed so dumb I couldn't believe I was doing it.</p><p>"Kakashi of the Sharingan," Zabuza said in turn, voice husky and darkly amused. "Did I get that right? It's a shame, but you'll have to hand over the old man."</p><p>For pre battle banter, everything was remarkably civil. You didn't need to be cruel to get things done.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I can't do that," Sensei replied. "Team, protect Tazuna and don't interfere. This guy is out of your league." His voice was heavy and serious.</p><p>I couldn't see, but by the sharp stillness of the group, I assumed Kakashi had just lifted his headband.</p><p>"The Sharingan. So I get to see it in action," Zabuza said. "This is an honour."</p><p>I couldn't tell if he was being sarcastic or truly meant it. I think he did, in a warped way. Maybe in a 'you're taking me seriously right from the start' way.</p><p>"What the hell?" Naruto shouted. "What's this Sharingan stuff?"</p><p>"Sharingan is a Bloodlimit. It's a dojutsu, a visual jutsu that resides in the eyes," Sasuke explained to him, voice low. "It allows the user to see and comprehend any gen, nin or taijutsu used against it and reflect it back against the attacker."</p><p>It could also predict attacks and cast genjutsu, I knew but didn't say. Now really wasn't the time for lessons on Bloodlimits.</p><p>"There's more to it than that," Zabuza added, "it can analyse an opponents techniques, then copy it to the smallest detail. In the Assassination Unit of the Hidden Mist we had a standing order to destroy you on sight, Kakashi Hatake."</p><p>The closest analogue Konoha had to the Assassination Unit would have been ANBU and that really wasn't the same because they had other functions. Konoha got no where near the volume of assassination missions that Mist did. Probably no where near the volume that other villages did either. Our PR as the 'nice' village probably saw to that.</p><p>"Your profile was in our Bingo Book," Zabuza continued. "It called you the man who copied over a thousand jutsu. Kakashi, the copy-ninja."</p><p>That surprised Sasuke and Naruto, whereas I had <em> seen</em> the page that Zabuza was talking about. It certainly did list some serious skills and assumed missions under Kakashi-sensei's name. Although, I wondered why Zabuza was giving us this impromptu lesson. Maybe he was bored. I can't imagine he'd get much scintillating conversation with Gatou's thugs.</p><p>"Wow," Naruto breathed, sounding highly impressed. "That's so cool."</p><p>"Enough talking," Zabuza decided finally. "I've been hired to get rid of the bridge builder, but I guess I'll have to go through you first, Kakashi."</p><p>"I'm afraid so," Kakashi-sensei said. "It wont be easy for you."</p><p>Zabuza sneered and leapt away, gaining distance. The fog roared in, obscuring both him and Kakashi-sensei from our view.</p><p>"I can't see anything!" Naruto hissed, alarmed.</p><p>"The Land of Waves is surrounded by ocean. These swirling mists are constant," Tazuna explained.</p><p>I shook my head. "This is no natural fog. It's a water release jutsu. The Hiding in the Mist Technique."</p><p>"Who was that guy?" Naruto asked, wonder in his voice.</p><p>"Zabuza Momochi. He's known as the Demon of Hidden Mist," I answered quietly, trying to track Zabuza and Sensei's chakra through the fog. It was difficult. The fog was chakra enhanced, so it was like trying to listen through static. You knew something was there, but you couldn't hear what they were saying. "He was the leader of the Mist Assassination Unit before he tried to kill the Mizukage and became a missing nin. There are rumours that he's been working with the Mist Rebellion."</p><p>"So, he's strong," Sasuke said ponderously.</p><p>"Very strong," I confirmed. "Supposedly, he's the master of the Silent Killing Technique, able to complete assassinations even when his target is under the heaviest of guards." His giant sword, Kubikiri Bocho, didn't exactly seem like it was designed for stealth and he had just challenged Kakashi-sensei to an out and out fight rather than try and work around him. He had had the advantage of secrecy and just given it up.</p><p>It didn't really make sense.</p><p>Then the mantra started.</p><p>"Eight points," Zabuza's voice rasped out of the fog, everywhere at once. The quiet, deliberate menace sent shivers down my spine. "Larynx, spine, lungs, liver, jugular, sub clavian artery, kidneys, heart. Now, which will be my attack point?"</p><p>Intimidation tactics, again.</p><p>It made no sense. Why speak to us, then hide? Why set us on our guard? It was terrifying, but it would have been so much worse if he hadn't introduced himself.</p><p><em> Hello, my name is Zabuza Momochi and I'll be your assassin for this evening.</em></p><p>I squashed the giggle that threatened to burst from my throat. He was getting to me.</p><p>I needed to <em> think.</em> There had to be some tactic, some plan I could use that would make this okay. But I couldn't. My mind, before so reliable at tossing out analysis and ideas, was spinning in circles. The hamster was off his wheel. The train of thought had been derailed. The light bulb had blown.</p><p>I had <em> known</em> we would face Zabuza. I had thought about it. I had <em> planned </em> for it. What had I… what had I…</p><p>Then the Killing Intent hit. It was pressing and heavy, blanketing and smothering; the darkness after a nightmare, the suffocation of being underwater, the vertigo of extreme heights… The eye of the predator was moving, and if you twitched, if you blinked, you would draw his attention and <em> die</em> .</p><p>It was the intent of two Jounin about to attack. For all their banter, they were serious. Deadly serious.</p><p>I wanted to run. To scream. To cry. To <em> attack</em> . Instead I did nothing, counting the frantic beats of my heart, breathing steady and shallow.</p><p><em> One, twothreefour</em> …</p><p>"Sasuke!" Sensei's voice snapped out. I jerked. Shit, I hadn't been paying attention to my surroundings. In trying to keep calm, I'd given myself tunnel vision. "Calm down. I'll protect you with my life. All of you." And with his words he sent a wave of Positive Intent washing over us. The near opposite of Killing Intent, it was so much harder to produce but wiped away our fear as though it had never been. I knew what it was. Dad used it sometimes and in my mind it was so heavily associated with safety that my brain didn't even have a chance to protest as all my muscles relaxed and my heart returned to a steady resting beat. The brain might have thought it was in charge, but often the body belied that. "I will not allow my comrades to die. Trust me."</p><p>"I wouldn't be so sure," Zabuza rasped, right behind me. "It's over."</p><p>My shadow lashed out without thought, grabbing and holding. To get so close to Tazuna, he had had to get close to me. My hands rotated, spinning the sharp edge of the sword until it was towards his body and pulling close. There was no thought, just action.</p><p>"Urk!" He grunted, as it stabbed in, blood gushing out. No. There was too much for it to be blood.</p><p>"A water clone!" I realised.</p><p>"Good work, Shikako," Kakashi-sensei praised. He was right by our little formation. He must have raced for us the instant Zabuza revealed himself. "Let's get rid of this fog, yeah?"</p><p>He pulsed with chakra, whipping the air around him and blowing the fog away. Being able to <em> see</em> again was relieving.</p><p>"A Nara, huh?" Zabuza's voice echoed. "Yeah, I've run into your clan before." He chuckled. "What a joke."</p><p>I scowled. He wasn't just using <em> intimidation</em> tactics, but trying to get me angry as well. Either option would cloud my thinking. The type of ninja who fought with huge swords and massive jutsu often looked down on us, but I knew better. Tactics, subtlety and misdirection nearly <em> always</em> trumped straight force. And that was exactly what Zabuza was trying to do. He was blending to the shadows, making <em> us </em> exhaust ourselves. In a small way, it was an achievement that he even registered me.</p><p>I told myself that. It didn't stop the little bubble of anger. Clan pride was always such an easy target. I could take insults to myself - they hurt but I could shake them off - but calling my <em> family </em> a joke?</p><p><em> Breathe. He's doing it on purpose. Control yourself and you control your environment. Control your environment and you control the battle</em> . It was a pithy saying, but the meaning was true and deep.</p><p>"Stay alert," Sensei murmured. Or sensei's clone? I squinted at it. There were more chakra signals in the area then there were people. "We're only just getting started."</p><p>"No, I think we're finishing up," Zabuza rasped, appearing behind him, sword already swinging.</p><p>I was the only one not surprised when Sensei dissolved into a splash of water.</p><p>"Behind you," Kakashi-sensei announced, kunai pulled tight against Zabuza's throat.</p><p>"Hmp. So you copied my water clone," Zabuza mused. "Good. But not good enough." And then he dissolved into water. Clones behind clones. My head ached trying to see who was truly leading this fight.</p><p>Sensei reacted a fraction of a second before he would have been decapitated. There was a brief flurry of taijutsu, dragging the two of them away from us. Zabuza's fighting style was brutal and his ability to control the massive weight of Kubikiri Bocho was nothing short of astonishing, even when momentum and inertia should have dragged it from his hand. Kakashi-sensei ducked and dodged and weaved around it, but was retreating step by step, away from us and onto the water.</p><p>Against a Mist ninja, that was probably the last place you wanted to be.</p><p>Sensei seemed to be handling it though. He was trying to keep distance between the two of them, relying more on ninjutsu than risking another taijutsu confrontation.</p><p>Then, abruptly, he was sucked under water.</p><p>"Water Release; Water Prison!" Zabuza shouted. A mass of water swirled and rose from the lake, Kakashi-sensei trapped inside it. "Water clones don't have to be formed on the surface, you know, they can wait patiently beneath the water until the unwary walk over them." He smirked.</p><p>Once I might have wondered if Sensei had done it on purpose. Going <em> into</em> the water against a Mist ninja seemed like asking for trouble. Only now, looking at the horror on his face, I knew there was no chance it was part of a plan.</p><p><em> Shit</em> .</p><p>Sensei, in trying to protect us and draw Zabuza away had miscalculated. He hadn't expected the Water Prison. Why should he have? True to it's name the Water Prison didn't actually harm - well, no more than being held underwater for a prolonged period of time - and actually limited the caster. It seemed a bizarre choice of jutsu to use.</p><p><em> Why capture sensei and not hurt him?</em></p><p>A clone was more than enough to deal with three Genin, without even considering Haku in the trees, but still… it seemed so odd. If he knew how much of a threat Kakashi-sensei was, if he was such a well known ninja that his death would increase Zabuza's reputation, why not go for the killing blow to get him out of the way permanently?</p><p>"This prison made of water, but it's stronger than steel. Hard to fight when you can't move." He smirked. "So much for the great Kakashi. I'll finish you off later. But first for your little friends. Water Clone Jutsu!"</p><p>A clone unfolded from the water. It strode forward. My mouth went dry; there was nothing between it and us. No sensei, no safety.</p><p>"You think wearing a headband makes you a ninja. When you've hovered between life and death so many times it doesn't faze you, then you may be called a ninja. When you've become so deadly your profile is entered in my Bingo Book, then you may have earned the title <em> ninja</em> . But to call upstarts like you 'ninja' is a joke."</p><p>Naruto clenched his fists. Zabuza was hitting him where it hurt. He was <em> proud</em> of being a ninja and he'd worked hard to get there. "Ah, shut up!" Naruto shouted. "Iruka-sensei gave me this headband and <em> he </em> decided I was good enough to be a ninja!" He formed a cross seal with his fingers. "Shadow Clone Jutsu!"</p><p>Fifty Naruto's charged forward, dog piling onto the water clone. Their team cohesion was a lot higher than it had been during the bell test and not a single one got in each other's way. It didn't help them, though.</p><p>"Che," Zabuza's clone said, throwing them off to explode into chakra smoke. "Shadow Clones huh? They wont help you. It'd take a thousand of you to even match me!"</p><p>There was a glint in Naruto's eye that seemed to say 'challenge accepted'.</p><p>Sensei <em> growled.</em> "Listen! Get the bridge builder and run. You can't win this fight!"</p><p>Sensei was talking. Underwater. I took a completely inappropriate moment to marvel at it. I knew there was a jutsu that could strip oxygen from the water to allow you to breathe, but that was just…</p><p>"Zabuza can only fight you with his water clone, but the clone can't go far from his real body! If you get away, he can't follow you. Now run!"</p><p>Sensei would probably be fine. Maybe. Zabuza didn't seem to want to kill him. But he had a partner that sensei didn't know about; Haku. Getting away wouldn't stop him.</p><p>And … sensei might <em> not</em> be fine.</p><p>I swallowed, that thought twisting my gut.</p><p>"Not an option," Sasuke said firmly. "That became impossible the instant you got caught. No matter how far we run, he'll track us down and wipe us out. Any defence we have… he can get around it in an instant. If we're on our own…"</p><p>I was thankful to Sasuke for making that decision. He'd assumed the position of mission leader, given us our objective and direction. I didn't <em> have</em> to make that decision now. I only had to follow.</p><p>"Shikako!" Sensei tried again. "Be sensible! Take the team and go!" I stared at him. Why single me out? Did he think I could <em> make</em> them? Did he think I was most likely to run? Did he think I could just… leave him there?</p><p>"We've got to rescue him," Sasuke said, voice low.</p><p>I drew in a breath, then let it out slowly. "Distance is no safety," I agreed. But my mind was blank. I could think of nothing.</p><p>Water, he was using water. Water was strong against fire, but weak to … lightning. And Earth.</p><p>No. Wait. Back up further. We had two objectives. Stop the clone attacking us. And free sensei. Zabuza couldn't move away from the Water Prison, so making him move would force him to release it.</p><p>Make him move.</p><p>Well.</p><p>What was I, a Nara or something?</p><p>Carefully, unobtrusively, I activated my shadow. Behind us were trees. They circled the clearing, right down to the water's edge. I could do this.</p><p>"We <em> are</em> ninja," Naruto shouted fiercely. "We <em> wont</em> run away!"</p><p>"What are you doing?" Kakashi-sensei shouted, frustration in his voice. "This fight was over the moment I got caught. Now take Tazuna and run! Your mission is not to prove how brave you are; it's to save the bridge builder! Stay on mission!"</p><p>Naruto flinched. "Bridge builder?" He asked, voice abnormally tentative.</p><p>Tazuna sighed, shoulders slumping over. "I guess this all happened because of me and my desire to live. But I wont let that stand in your way now. Forget about me and do what you have to do! Go and fight to save your sensei!"</p><p>Tazuna really was courageous. Defying Gatou to build a bridge to save his people and now…</p><p>Accepting the inevitable is a kind of courage too.</p><p>Although, our defeat only <em> appeared</em> inevitable.</p><p>"Alright," Sasuke said. The corner of his mouth lifted into a smirk. "You hear that?"</p><p>Naruto nodded. "Yeah. Let's do this!"</p><p>I straightened. "I'll back you up." I couldn't tell them what I was actually doing, but I hoped they guessed.</p><p>Zabuza's clone just chuckled at our determination. "You really haven't learnt anything, have you? Still playing your little games, pretending to be ninja. When I was your age, this hand had already crushed many opponents."</p><p>"Zabuza, the Demon of the Mist…" Kakashi-sensei said.</p><p>"Heh. So I was in your book too." Zabuza sounded more resigned than proud.</p><p>"Long ago, the Village Hidden in the Mist, was also known as the Village of the Bloody Mist, " Kakashi-sensei started.</p><p>I quirked an eyebrow. Were we really going to have a history lesson in the middle of battle? Well never let it be said that I didn't appreciate proper stalling tactics. I was appreciating them a whole lot right now. I had to move my shadow deep into the forest, where it wouldn't be seen from the clearing, then circle around. The more Kakashi-sensei could stall, the better.</p><p>"Before a student could become a ninja, they had one final test…"</p><p>I shivered. I already knew this story, but his grim tones held my attention. Yes, I was glad I had been reborn in Konoha.</p><p>"You know about the graduation exam?" Zabuza asked, sounding honestly surprised. I suppose he had a right to be. That exam hadn't been held for almost twenty years.</p><p>"What? What's the big deal?" Naruto asked. "We had graduation exams too…"</p><p>"Did you have to kill the other students to pass?" Zabuza asked, seeming amused. "Imagine, young ninja like you, eating together, training together, and then comes the final exam. And then the rules changed. You couldn't stop until you killed your opponent. He was your friend, shared your dreams. Now it's either him … or you."</p><p>"But the exam changed," Kakashi-sensei continued. "One year, a boy, not even a ninja, approached the class and without pause or hesitation… took down over one hundred other students."</p><p>I couldn't help but suck in a breath. One hundred. That was… a huge number to try and wrap your head around. One hundred people.</p><p>"It felt… so good!" Zabuza's clone said, voice edging into a snarl.</p><p>Then he attacked. No warning, just an angry explosion of energy. Sasuke took the brunt of the attack, too shocked to properly react. The clone wasn't using his sword, just brutal taijutsu; kicks, knees, elbows.</p><p>He flattened Sasuke, laying him out on the ground, then stamping down on him. Sasuke gasped for air.</p><p>I abandoned my shadow for a moment, wringing my hands through a rapid set of seals. "Earth Release: Earth Spike!" I yelled, slapping my hands down on the ground. A huge pillar of sharpened earth erupted from the ground, curving around Sasuke, forcing Zabuza's clone to back off.</p><p>"You want a thousand of me?" Naruto growled. He and Sasuke didn't call each other 'friend' but they were team mates. "MASS SHADOW CLONE JUTSU!" He roared.</p><p>I used the distraction that was offered. In the sea of orange, my shadow cut across the ground, slipping out of the trees and seamlessly into the water. The lake was deep, but that changed nothing.</p><p>Half my attention remained on watching Naruto and Sasuke fighting. I sent out a shadow spike toward the clone, half to make him dodge, half to convince Zabuza that I was focused on the fight. I didn't want him questioning what I was doing.</p><p>The rest of my attention was focused on getting my shadow to Zabuza without attracting his attention. As long as he didn't look down… the water was reasonably clear, he would probably be able to see it on the lake bed.</p><p>But Naruto was <em> good</em> at keeping attention focused on him. A thousand Naruto's was a force to be reckoned with, if just for sheer number. The fact that Sasuke was hiding amongst them only made it worse.</p><p><em> Careful. Careful.</em></p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete!" I announced, then yanked both hands in tightly to my chest.</p><p>And Sensei exploded out of the Water Prison like a vengeful god.</p><p>The escalation in violence was as sudden as it was alarming. Before, Kakashi-sensei and Zabuza had been fighting minimally. They had used basic jutsu - clones and mist - mixed with taijutsu and trickery. Now, they were throwing overkill jutsu at each other. I couldn't hear what Kakashi-sensei and Zabuza were saying to each other, out there on the water, but I could see them. Zabuza looked… afraid. Sensei's shoulders were tight with anger, and more than that, worry.</p><p>He looked like someone who had escaped a horrifying mistake by the narrowest of margins and was going to ensure it <em> never</em> happened again.</p><p>By very final and permanent means.</p><p>I didn't really have time to watch, however much I would have wanted to. I held my Shadow Possession Jutsu through Sensei's first attack before it gave out to the stress of distance and power difference. Then I turned my attention back to the water clone that was still throwing Naruto and Sasuke about. It wouldn't do for the clone to kill us before Sensei was finished with the real one.</p><p>"Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall!" I barked, sending a wall up between Sasuke and the sword attempting to kill him. He flicked me a grateful look, before vaulting over the wall and back into the fray. They weren't actually doing too badly. The fact was, when it came to thinking on the fly, Naruto could be pretty damn crafty.</p><p>My chakra was starting to run dry. I could do another earth technique. Maybe two. Jumping into the fight wouldn't help, there were already enough bodies over there. It would leave Tazuna undefended, anyway. I had my shadow and maybe a genjutsu?</p><p>I bit my lip. Did genjutsu work on clones? And if they did what would be the best one to use?</p><p>"Hah!" Naruto shouted, bursting out of the ground behind Zabuza, grabbing him in a lock. Had he? Yes, he'd tunnelled through the earth, starting in the lee behind my Earth Wall where Zabuza couldn't see. Sasuke took immediate advantage, stabbing him with a kunai straight into the ribs.</p><p>"Brats," he growled, dissolving into water.</p><p>"Hah," Naruto panted, clones puffing out of existence. "Take that, you freak."</p><p>Sasuke smirked. "Heh."</p><p>We barely had time to brace ourselves before a wave of water blasted past us, carrying Sensei and Zabuza with it. It was obvious now who was winning.</p><p>"Your future, Zabuza," Kakashi-sensei intoned. "Is death!"</p><p>Chakra spiked behind me, a signal I had almost forgotten about. Haku!</p><p><em> Shit. He better not be attacking.</em></p><p>I didn't see him move. He was fast. Very fast. Senbon whistled through the air with inhuman accuracy and Zabuza collapsed. His enormous chakra vanished so fast it felt like it disappeared. But… no, there was still the smallest, tiniest spark burning steady. If I hadn't been looking for it, I probably wouldn't have noticed it.</p><p>"Thank you," the crouching boy in the Hunter-nin mask said. "I have been tracking him for some time."</p><p>Kakashi looked over him with a lazy eye, crouching to check Zabuza's pulse. "He's dead," he said. It was an odd situation; if Haku had been willing to let him fight Zabuza, then interfering at the moment of the kill seemed suspicious.</p><p>Haku crouched and pulled Zabuza's body over his shoulders. "Farewell." He vanished.</p><p>There was a beat of silence.</p><p>"What the hell?" Naruto exploded. "Who the hell was that guy?"</p><p>"That mask marks him as one of the elite Hunter-nin from Hidden Mist," Kakashi-sensei explained, sliding his headband back down. "It's their job to hunt down missing ninja and kill them, in order to protect their village's secrets."</p><p>Naruto frowned. "That's so…"</p><p>Sensei might have smiled bitterly. I couldn't tell. "That's how life is in the ninja world. Now, we had better get back to our mission …"</p><p>He trailed off, swaying where he was standing.</p><p>Then, without fanfare, collapsed.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Waves Arc: Chapter 11</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: <em> Fear is the mind killer, </em> is a quote from Dune. Its such a good line that I had to use it. I haven't read Dune in years and I still remember it. Also please note that I am in no way any kind of engineer. All bridge info was gained from Wikipedia. XD</p><p>And, also, thank you very much to everyone who leaves such thoughtful reviews. I appreciate it. You're what inspires me to write the next chapter so very quickly.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 11</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Always keep your clothes and weapons where you can find them in the dark ~ Robert Heinlein</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I sprinted for Kakashi-sensei, boosting my legs with chakra to achieve more than twice my usual speed.</p><p>Having your Jounin sensei pass out on you was <em> not</em> a good thing.</p><p>I rolled him onto his back, checking the ABC's of first aid.</p><p><em> Airways. Breathing. Circulation.</em></p><p>For half a second, I panicked over his mask, but it was surprisingly thin material. I could feel his breath puffing out, could measure the slow beat of his carotid pulse. His heart rate was incredibly low, but I didn't worry about that. Ninja were extreme athletes, our hearts were conditioned to have a large stroke volume in order to supply large amounts of oxygen while we were exercising. That meant then, that our resting heart rates were very low due to the much lower oxygen demand. So a slow pulse wasn't automatically something to worry about.</p><p>I sat back on my heels, that first flutter of panic fading. My hands walked slowly through the seals, as I formed the Yin chakra. "Yin Release: Diagnostic Jutsu!"</p><p>My hands glowed green and I lowered them to his chest. A good medic can assimilate all the information that the jutsu gives them in under a second. I definitely couldn't. I had to focus specifically on different areas in order to clarify and understand the readings my chakra was giving me.</p><p>"No water in the lungs," I murmured, frowning with concentration. That was the first thought that had come to mind; that whatever jutsu he was using to breath underwater wasn't as efficient as it appeared. Thankfully, that didn't seem to be the case. "Blood pressure… normal. No internal bleeding. No <em> external</em> bleeding. No broken bones." Obviously broken bones anyway. I wasn't sure I'd pick up finer details like hairline fractures. "Nervous system… clear. Chakra system… hmmm."</p><p>Yup. That was the most likely problem. His chakra system was practically empty. Not only that, but his Sharingan eye, even covered, was eating chakra at an alarming rate. His chakra production rate only exceeded it by a tiny amount, meaning it would take him a loooong time to recover his full reserves. Chakra exhaustion often caused collapse, but more of the 'my arms and legs aren't working' variety than full out unconsciousness. It was like Kakashi-sensei's system had pre-empted him and just shut down.</p><p>But, well, I was hardly a medic-nin. I couldn't tell if there was anything else wrong with him.</p><p>"Chakra exhaustion," I told the boys. "He's not going to be getting up any time soon."</p><p>They sighed in relief.</p><p>"My place isn't far from here," Tazuna offered. He looked remarkably calm, except for the death grip he had on his sake bottle.</p><p>I nodded and assessed my chakra levels. They were nearly gutted out. There was no way I'd be able to walk him there with my Shadow Jutsu. "Naruto? Do you think you have enough chakra for a few clones?"</p><p>Naruto grinned. "Sure thing!" Several Naruto's shimmered into existence around us, one turning into a stretcher shortly afterwards. I started, then shrugged. They were chakra constructs after all, why couldn't they change their shape? The Shadow Clone Jutsu was the parent jutsu of the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu tree and you could use it to create duplicates of just about anything.</p><p>We were greeted with a large measure of relief by Tazuna's daughter - Tsunami - as we arrived, though she looked very worried when she caught sight of Kakashi-sensei limp form.</p><p>"Is there somewhere we can put Sensei?" Sasuke asked, once introductions were done.</p><p>"There's a guest room upstairs," Tazuna said, looking more relaxed now that he was home than he had been the whole journey. "Do you need anything?"</p><p>I cast a worried glance at Sensei. "I don't think so. We'll let you know."</p><p>Navigating a stretcher up a narrow flight of stairs is slightly trickier than it sounds, but we managed easily enough.</p><p>"So… can you fix him?" Naruto asked, looking at me once we had Sensei situated on a futon.</p><p>"Sensei is chakra exhausted. I could do a chakra transfusion but…" I bit my lip nervously. "I… I don't have enough chakra to heal him."</p><p>The two exchanged looks that seemed to say 'well, fuck'. I forged on. "I mean, I know a technique… but I've never really used it before…"</p><p>"Well, what does it do?" Naruto asked impatiently.</p><p>"Umm… It uses other peoples chakra." That was the most simplified version of it. There was more to it than that. You had to purify it and convert it and channel it. If you did it wrong, you could end up with chakra poisoning which was similar to blood poisoning. "I… Naruto has the most chakra out of all of us," I confessed. Sasuke might have been a better match element wise since he'd been lightening element too, but I didn't think Sasuke had enough to heal sensei without sending <em> him</em> into an exhaustion state. No, Sasuke's chakra was more useful in himself.</p><p>Naruto didn't even pause. "Yes! You totally can use my chakra. Come on, we have to fix sensei!" He bounced on his feet, previous worry forgotten.</p><p>"I don't know if it will work," I said, a ball of nervousness writing in my stomach. Especially since Naruto had… other chakra. Which was supposedly poisonous to people. That was the last thing we needed. "I need to practice. Can you channel chakra to your hands?"</p><p>They lit up in a blue glow. Cautiously, I touched it, chakra snaking over it in ribbons. He giggled at the feeling. I have only ever been able to describe how chakra feels like by comparing it to something else. Sensei's chakra is like static electricity, building and buzzing for a moment of attack. Sasuke's is like an ember, smouldering before bursting into flame once more. Shikamaru's is like a lazy black cat winding around your ankles.</p><p>Naruto's… Naruto's is like the sun. Bright and cheerful and playful with the potential for scorching, pitiless force. Any Sand nin will tell you that high summer in the desert is the most dangerous time of all.</p><p>But there wasn't an ounce of Kyuubi in it.</p><p>I puffed out a breath. "I think I can do it." I nodded, as if to convince myself. "Naruto, can you do that <em> and</em> create Shadow Clones?"</p><p>He looked puzzled. "Yeah, of course."</p><p>"Maybe we should set up a perimeter?" I asked, glancing at Sasuke.</p><p>He caught on quickly and nodded. "Hn. Give me four clones and we'll scout out the surroundings and set up a patrol."</p><p>Narutos puffed into existence, though they looked less than enthusiastic about following Sasuke.</p><p>"Right," I said, trying not to tremble. "Let's do this."</p><p>Chakra transfusions weren't used a lot. Long term, they weren't exactly healthy, since the body started actually producing <em> less</em> chakra. Most of the time, Medic-nin just proscribed rest and food in order to rebuild your own reserves. But at the rate that Sensei's chakra reserves were filling even in a weeks time he'd still be at less than half his maximum.</p><p>I knelt beside Sensei, Naruto directly across from me. "Yin Release: Chakra Transfusion Jutsu." My hands glowed green. Naruto placed his, glowing blue, overtop of them.</p><p>I started drawing it in and purifying it, smoothing out the waves and flows, removing as much of the elemental nature of the chakra as I could, then carefully and delicately introducing it to Sensei's coils. It was slow going and took a lot of concentration.</p><p>After ten minutes, my hands started to go numb from the amount of chakra pushing through them. I gritted my teeth and kept going. It <em> was</em> working. Slowly but surely, Kakashi-sensei's chakra system was filling up. It was a little like trying to fill a bucket with a teaspoon, but we'd get there eventually.</p><p>Sensei snapped awake so fast I didn't even register. Once second he was out of it, the next, my wrists were pinned in an unforgiving grip and his grey eye bored mercilessly into me.</p><p>"Sensei?" I said timidly. My wrists ached at the grip, it felt like my bones were grinding together. I wanted to reinforce them with chakra, but I didn't dare. It might have been taken as a threat, and rule one of dealing with injured jounin is to never make a move that might be considered an attack.</p><p>Of course, Naruto clearly hadn't read the same book. "Hey! Hey, Kakashi-sensei, what are you doing?" he exclaimed. Loudly.</p><p>Sensei's eye flickered to him, then his grip relaxed. I let out the breath I wasn't aware I had been holding.</p><p>"Well, good morning, my cute little students," he said, eye curving as he smiled. "What are you two up to?"</p><p>"We're healing you," I answered politely. "Please allow me to finish, sensei."</p><p>Like hell was I going to try without asking for permission, not after that.</p><p>"Maa, that's not really necessary, Shikako," he replied, waving it off. I huffed in frustration. His chakra levels were only about a quarter filled. While chakra transfusions weren't as good as letting them refill naturally, in this situation I was pretty sure an exception should be made.</p><p>"Sensei," I tried. "You really need healing." He looked absolutely unconvinced. I hated arguing. However, I wanted to die even less. "You're the only one with the skill to fight Zabuza if he comes back."</p><p>Naruto interrupted me. "Zabuza is dead, remember? That freaky Hunter-nin guy got him."</p><p>I bit my lip again. I really had to stop doing that. "I could be wrong but… his chakra was still there. It was compressed but… I think he's still alive." The fight had gone differently to canon, but Haku had still come. And I was pretty sure he had still pulled the same trick. That was the only reason I had sensed deep enough to find Zabuza's chakra. If I hadn't been looking, I wouldn't have found it. But I didn't like trying to use future knowledge without present evidence to back it up. Too many things could change and what I did know was vague.</p><p>Sensei looked troubled. "Yes. Hunter nin generally dispose of the body on the spot to prevent people from gaining village secrets. And senbon are not usually killing weapons."</p><p>Things always seemed obvious when someone else pointed them out.</p><p>I could see him torn between his dislike of healing and the new information he was assimilating.</p><p>"Please, Kakashi-sensei?" I added.</p><p>He sighed. "It would be for the best."</p><p>I nodded at Naruto and we resumed. With Kakashi-sensei awake and able to willingly receive chakra it went much faster than before, but Sasuke had returned by the time we were finished.</p><p>"Done," I said, sitting back, exhausted. I pushed by bangs out of my eyes and flexed my fingers. Both my hands were full of pins and needles as they overcompensated for releasing the technique.</p><p>"The house is secure," Sasuke reported. "And there are four Shadow Clone patrolling in a reverse rotation pattern. That doesn't cover the water, though."</p><p>"Very efficient," Kakashi-sensei said approvingly. "I guess that makes up for ignoring my order before." There was a wry tone to his voice.</p><p>Sasuke shrugged and looked away from him. I yawned, then quickly covered it with my hand.</p><p>Naruto snorted and crossed his arms looking completely unimpressed. "Shouldn't give stupid orders, then."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei sighed. "Well, I suppose that's as good as I'm going to get. Let's go talk to Tazuna then."</p><p>Tazuna was surprised to see Kakashi up and about already but grateful to him. We were all exhausted, so dinner was a quiet affair. We set a night watch before conking out. I had dawn watch again, a fact that I was grateful for. I wasn't sure I could have stayed awake for the dusk watch.</p><p>Naruto woke me after what felt like not nearly enough sleep. If I'd been at home, you wouldn't have been able to drag me out of bed for love or money, but… Mission.</p><p>Grudgingly, I stumbled outside, letting the cold air wake me. Naruto had passed on the location of all the perimeter traps and obstacles, information which had felt like it went in one ear and out the other, but apparently did stick in my memory. I checked them all on automatic, my mind slowly revving itself up back to normal capacity.</p><p>Zabuza's encounter had been quite <em> odd</em> . I'd even noted that at the time, but had been too distracted by needing to <em> do</em> things. And by terror. I was able to admit that. Fear had been incredibly distracting.</p><p><em> Fear is the mind killer,</em> went the saying. Far too true. Doubly bad since my mind should have been my most important tactical asset.</p><p>But now, free from that fear, things started grabbing my attention. Haku. Why stay hidden? Zabuza can't have <em> expected </em> he'd need saving, could he? Why attack at all, then? Why the pre-battle conversation? He had to have recognised Kakashi-sensei even before the Sharingan was unveiled. He was pretty distinctive. His chances of success would have been much higher if Kakashi-sensei hadn't known who was attacking. Particularly since Sensei admitted that even his Sharingan couldn't negate Zabuza's skill with the Silent Killing Technique.</p><p>It was counter intuitive.</p><p>We held a team meeting after breakfast, all four of us and Tazuna crowding around the low table. Tsunami was in the kitchens washing the dishes, and there was a smaller chakra presence upstairs. The grandson we hadn't yet met.</p><p>"Alright team," Kakashi-sensei started. "Good news first. You did a good job getting Tazuna to safety and securing the house. Bad news, Zabuza isn't dead. Heavily injured, maybe, but we can count on him coming back for another round. I'd give it a week, at least, which means we have time to get you lot up to scratch."</p><p>Sasuke was the only one of us who hadn't heard this information last night and he expressed no surprise at all. I suspected that Naruto had filled him in while I was asleep. Which was good, passing important information on to your team members was part of team work too. No one should be operating in the dark.</p><p>Tazuna, on the other hand, was very surprised. "Not dead? But you … how could he have survived?"</p><p>Kakashi motioned at me with his hand.</p><p>"Err," I stuttered. He wanted me to explain? Why? "The person that collected him wasn't actually a Hunter-nin. He was likely Zabuza's partner. They arrived together and his chakra remained hidden in the trees during the whole fight. He interfered during the end of the fight to save Zabuza's life by putting him in a near death state with his senbon. By protocol, Hunter-nin are supposed to destroy the body in the location that it is killed, in order to prevent it becoming lost, stolen or activating fail safes. The fact that he took it away is highly suspicious. Added to that, although Kakashi-sensei confirmed that Zabuza wasn't breathing and was without a pulse, his chakra was still present."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei was staring at me very seriously. "What?" I asked nervously, running over the facts I'd just given. Had I got it wrong?</p><p>His eye curved into a smile. "Nothing," he said. <em> Fake</em> , I diagnosed, but let it go.</p><p>"So what does that mean for us?" Sasuke asked, to the point.</p><p>"It means that we're going to run into Zabuza again. He isn't the kind of person to give up. It also means there is another ninja out there with an unknown skill level. He might be more than a match for you."</p><p>"How can he be?" Naruto protested. "He wasn't that much older than us!"</p><p>"You'll eventually learn, that in the ninja world, there can be people that are younger than you… but stronger than me." I didn't, didn't, glance towards Sasuke, even though that reference fit Itachi to a T. At our age, he had been ANBU captain. It was hard to say he had been stronger than Kakashi then… but he definitely was now.</p><p>"Sensei?" I asked tentatively. "That fight… it's bothering me. It was…strange." I didn't know how to word it better than that. "Zabuza's actions…they don't make sense."</p><p>Tazuna snorted. "He wanted to kill me. What doesn't make sense?"</p><p>I glanced at him. "You're alive," I said bluntly. "He could have struck before any of us knew he was there. But he didn't. He gave up an advantage and gained nothing tangible for it. Why…" I trailed off, looking back at Sensei. His expression was unreadable.</p><p>"Why do <em> you</em> think he did it?" Kakashi-sensei asked instead.</p><p>I sighed. <em> If I knew I wouldn't ask</em> , I wanted to retort. I didn't. Instead, I arched my fingers together and stared at them. The 'thinking seal' didn't actually do anything for me, it was just somewhere to direct my attention. It was also a cue to those around me: shut up, I'm thinking about something.</p><p>"It was a warning," I decided. "Zabuza was very forthright about his intentions, even though it would have served him better to sneak up on us, maybe a night time assassination. He had several options where he could have succeed against us, not to mention his partner, the Hunter-nin, who only interfered to remove him from the situation and not to attack us. It's possible he is ideologically opposed to Gatou's plans, given his main argument against the Mizukage involved the extreme oppression in Mist. Therefore, Gatou either has something to use against him, unlikely, something he desperately requires, or he's using Gatou as a cover to accomplish something else."</p><p>I sorted through the information I knew, things I assumed, and made several leaps. "If Zabuza is working with the Mist Rebels as rumoured, it's possible that he's trying to gain the support of the Shipping Company for their cause. Given the island nature of the Land of Water, the rebels either have to stay hidden on a small island, or be capable of transporting themselves back and forth quickly and stealthily, which smuggling with the Shipping Company would provide. If he isn't working with the rebels, the most likely consideration for taking this mission would be money, as it has been noted that Gatou is one of the wealthiest men in the world. I can't really think of any other tasks Zabuza could be trying to accomplish in the area. There really isn't much around Land of Waves. Unless he's trying to lie low but then he probably would have avoided us instead."</p><p>Tazuna's sake bottle missed his mouth and dribbled down his chin as he stared at me.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei hummed. "It's possible," he allowed. "But then Zabuza will feel motivated to complete this mission not just for success of the mission itself, but because it's important to his cause. So he wouldn't deliberately cause complications."</p><p>I frowned, staring back down at my hands, to find a counter argument to his devil's advocate. "Unless Gatou has give him reason to believe that he isn't trustworthy, or if the conditions of the arrangement aren't to his satisfaction. Then he would likely draw the mission out to force Gatou's hand in one direction or another." Gatou certainly didn't sound like a man that would honour his word. At least ninja stuck to a mission once it had been accepted. And a rebellion might not have that much to offer him in return for his assistance. Except for hired ninja, of course, which might explain why someone like Zabuza was here in the first place.</p><p>It was a good theory, but only a theory. And it relied on a crucial piece of information that I was only assuming. Whether Zabuza really was working with the Rebellion.</p><p>"Is it really important?" Sasuke asked. Naruto was wearing a stunned mullet expression.</p><p>"People's motives are important," I said quietly. "Because knowing <em> why</em> someone is doing something will help you discover what they're going to do next. For example, if Zabuza was only trying to discover our capabilities, he would probably come up with a way to draw Kakashi-sensei off to attack Tazuna, or use his assassination skills to get around us."</p><p>Tazuna went pale and started drinking again.</p><p>"But," I continued. "If he's trying to bargain with Gatou, he might stage a huge confrontation or actively sabotage him and blame it on us so that Gatou thinks an alliance with him is in his best interests."</p><p>"Wow," Naruto breathed. "That's… incredible! You're really smart."</p><p>I flushed. "But I don't know which one is right," I admitted. Dad would have been able to pinpoint the day, time, location and method of attack down to the minute, as well as explain every conceivable reason behind it. Heck, even Shika could have probably done better.</p><p>"Well, we'll just have to account for all eventualities, then," Kakashi-sensei said brightly, clapping his hands together, and not offering <em> any</em> opinion on which option he thought was most likely. "So, suggestions?"</p><p>Naruto looked at me. I looked helplessly back at him and Sasuke.</p><p>"One of us should remain with Tazuna at all times," Sasuke stated. "We should maintain a safe perimeter around the house to prevent intruders or hostage takers. We should scout the bridge before he arrives every morning for traps."</p><p>"A textbook answer," Kakashi-sensei said. "Well, you were top of the class, so I guess it's too be expected."</p><p>Was that praise or disappointment? I frowned. Judging by Sasuke's blank face, he picked up on the ambiguity too.</p><p>It was what we were taught was common procedure. Although, granted, it probably wouldn't do much against Zabuza. The only thing to do there would be to let Kakashi-sensei handle it. Still, Gatou apparently had a small army of thugs and mercenaries working for him and they were covered by our mission orders.</p><p>"It doesn't matter what you do," a sour voice interjected. The small chakra presence that had been upstairs was now in the hallway staring at us, giving us our first look at Tazuna's grandson. He was about eight or nine, wearing an oversized bucket hat.</p><p>"Oh, Inari!" Tazuna called. "There you are. Come and say hello to these people. They are the ones who protected Grandpa."</p><p>"Gatou is too strong. You're only going die!" Inari said, ignoring Tazuna's introduction.</p><p>"Sa, kid," I said. "That's the thing about life. No one gets out alive." It was a pithy quote, one I'd remembered for how utterly <em> true</em> it was. Speaking as someone who'd already died once…</p><p>I didn't want to die again. There was too much here, too much still to do. And Shika, Chouji, Ino, Sakura, Naruto… I didn't want to leave them behind. There was a place in my heart that still ached terribly whenever I thought about the life I had left behind. I didn't think I could manage that again.</p><p>"Well on that cheerful note, lets talk about your assignments for the day."</p><p>"Didn't you hear me?" the boy shouted. "Gatou's too strong!"</p><p>"Then we'll just get stronger!" Naruto shouted back. "Giving up like a wuss is no way to do things!"</p><p>And hearing Naruto say it made it so simple. Why was the issue any more complicated than that? I could give thousands of reasons why it was, but Naruto cut straight to the heart of the matter.</p><p>"I'm going to be Hokage one day!" Naruto continued. "Whoever this Gatou guy is, he doesn't stand a chance against me!"</p><p>"Pff, what do you think you are? A hero? There's no such things as heroes." That was a lot of scorn from such a little kid. "If you don't want to die, you should leave." He turned to go back upstairs.</p><p>"If we leave," I said calmly, reasonably, "then it will be your Grandfather that dies."</p><p>He froze and cast a stricken look back at us, then bolted for the stairs, slamming the sliding door shut behind him.</p><p>"Sorry," Tazuna said, lowing his face in shame. "Gatou's oppression of Wave Country has resulted in many terrible things. It's been hard on a lot of people, Inari included."</p><p>"People react in many different ways to traumatic events," I said shrugging. "Trying to pull others down into misery with them is fairly common. Misery loves company and all that."</p><p>"We'll show him," Naruto said fiercely, staring at the now shut door. "There <em> are so</em> such things as heroes."</p><p>In Naruto's personal, private world, everything existed as so much larger than life. There were heroes and there were monsters, there were dragons to be fought and princesses to be rescued, and there was fame and appreciation and crowds roaring with applause for the one who managed it. He was determined to be one of those heroes.</p><p>Sasuke might not have believed in heroes, but Sasuke believed in getting stronger. Inari's 'give up or you'll die' attitude was the antithesis of everything he believed. Sasuke believed 'if you give up, you die'.</p><p>"Right," Kakashi-sensei said, shifting a bit. "Now, how are you boys at Tree Walking?"</p><p>"Awesome!" Naruto said. "I don't fall off anymore at all!"</p><p>Sasuke nodded.</p><p>That was kind of impressive. It'd been less than a week since I showed them, and we'd been doing missions and other training too. Then again, Sasuke was mule-headed stubborn once he got something in his head to do and Naruto had had Shadow Clones training with him.</p><p>"Good, good. That'll help your control." Sensei scratched his chin through his mask. "Given the location, I think it'd help you learn water walking."</p><p>Which made sense. Pretty much any place we fought was going to have large quantities of water in it.</p><p>"Since Shikako can already do that, she can go with Tazuna to the bridge today."</p><p>Naruto spotted a flaw in this arrangement. "And what are you going to be doing? Huh Sensei?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei smiled at him cheerily. "Oh, this and that. More of that than this, I think."</p><p>There was a second of disbelief, which was starting to become the norm when Kakashi-sensei sprouted off nonsensical lines. Sasuke shook his head in disgust.</p><p>Naruto crossed his arms and glowered. "Probably going to laze around reading your stupid book," he huffed.</p><p>Sensei looked affronted. "Icha Icha isn't stupid."</p><p>Okay, <em> that</em> was enough of the comedy act. "Tazuna," I said, turning to the bridge builder. "What time do you normally begin work at the bridge?"</p><p>"As early as I can," Tazuna replied. "A lot of the men get there before me since these old bones don't like the mornings like they used to. They know what to do, in any case. I'm more like the overseer, the manager of the project."</p><p>"Alright." An idea came to me. "Hey, Naruto, how long do your clones last?"</p><p>He blinked away from his glaring at Sensei. "Eh, I don't know. Why?"</p><p>"Can I take one with me? In case I need to call for reinforcements or pass a message, or something?"</p><p>"Oh! Because of the memory thing! Sure."</p><p>Okay, so <em> I</em> was abusing the Shadow Clone Jutsu and I didn't even know it. But it wasn't like it was hurting Naruto or anything. The last thing I wanted was to be stranded alone and facing Zabuza or Haku without any way to call for backup. Even if I suspected that Sensei would be around and keeping an eye on things.</p><p>"And maybe keep one at the house with Tsunami and Inari? In case people try and come after them?"</p><p>Naruto nodded eagerly. I was a little worried he would complain about the extra work, but I think he liked being important. His clones seemed to be indispensable. Well, they were. Coordinating things between team members was one of the big stumbling blocks of ninja teams, particularly when spread over a large area.</p><p>There were ways to do it, summons, messenger birds, radios, certain jutsu and seals, but none of them were readily available to us at the moment.</p><p>This was, so I was going to make the most of it.</p><p>I followed Tazuna to the bridge, leaving him with the clone for a short period of time to dash ahead and check for ambushes or traps. There was nothing, thankfully. The workers seemed highly relieved to see Tazuna; they must have worried ever since he left to hire ninja. They seemed like good people; hard workers and brave enough to go against Gatou by building the bridge. Given the state of the economy, I can't imagine that Tazuna was able to pay them much, if at all for their help.</p><p>The bridge was <em> huge.</em> I had noted that before, when we had sailed past it, but from up here it was even more obvious. The distance between the Land of Waves and the Land of Fire was maybe a kilometre, maybe a bit more. The width of the bridge would have been six lanes, easily. Even in my old world, a bridge that size would have been unique.</p><p>As far as I could understand, the bridge was a simple structure beam bridge, with nearly one hundred pairs of piers dug deep into the ocean floor. Beam bridges tended to be short spans, because they grew weaker with length due to the compression forces on the deck, but using so many piers meant there were many short spans instead of one long one. The piers themselves connected into a support frame called a trestle.</p><p>It all seemed much more complicated than I had thought it would be. I'd never really thought about <em> how</em> bridges were built before.</p><p>Most of this information I gleaned listening to Tazuna talk to the workers and the conversations between the workers themselves. There was also a fair bit of complaining about Gatou. Apparently the situation had become much worse in the time that Tazuna had been gone. Food prices were up because supplies were down again. Someone's warehouse had burnt down under suspicious circumstances. Someone's food stall had been charged extra 'taxes'; <em> that</em> sounded like a standard protection racket charge. A dozen of Gatou's men had gotten drunk at the pub and started a bar brawl that ended with a few locals seriously injured. The local doctor had been called to a port town on the coast and hadn't been able to return.</p><p>Tazuna listened grimly and offered what hope he could. It was grouchy, terse encouragement, but it was hope all the same. These people looked up to him. They trusted that his bridge would make things better. Tazuna wasn't the village mayor or elder or anything of the kind, but he might as well have been.</p><p>I shadowed Tazuna for most of the morning, scouting the bridge for hazards and ambush sites and potential avenues of attack if we were ambushed. I listened to the conversations around me but eventually I retreated to the top of a stack of crates that nobody was using. From there I could see most of the bridge and keep an eye on Tazuna easily.</p><p>It also meant I had a chance to sit down. I felt exhausted. After yesterday, both fights, then healing Kakashi-sensei my chakra was severely depleted. Sleep helped, but it took more than a day to fully replenish your reserves. I'd taken in a bit of Naruto's chakra during the transfusion - not by choice, but simply because it slipped away from me, which was probably the only reason I wasn't <em> actually</em> chakra exhausted. That was probably also the reason that Sensei hadn't given me any training to do while I watched Tazuna.</p><p>"This is boring," the Naruto clone groaned, stretching out on the crates beside me.</p><p>"A little," I agreed. "Did you want to play Shogi?"</p><p>I had a tiny travel set sealed into my scroll. The pieces were all magnetised to stick to the board so you didn't lose them. I could play <em> and</em> keep an eye on Tazuna easily enough.</p><p>"I don't know how," Naruto admitted. Naruto's clone. It was hard to remember that it wasn't the real one.</p><p>"That's okay. I'll teach you," I said, unsealing it and placing it on the crates between us. "It'll make the time go faster."</p><p>Naruto was a pretty awful player. He couldn't remember what pieces did what, or work out how to use them together to create game tactics. That was alright. I didn't really expect him to pick it up immediately.</p><p>When the sun started to creep towards the horizon, I packed the game back up and jumped down to land lightly beside Tazuna.</p><p>He flinched. "Oh, it's just you. Where've you been?"</p><p>"Keeping watch." I shrugged. "No sign of any suspicious activity."</p><p>"Good, good. Let's hope it stays that way." He peered at the groups still working. "We'll be heading off now. Got to stop by the shops to pick up some groceries for Tsunami, though."</p><p>I nodded. "Alright." I turned to Naruto. "Why don't you dispel and let the others know we'll be home soon?"</p><p>"Sure thing!" He dispelled in a puff of smoke.</p><p>Tazuna shook his head. "Still don't know how you can do things like that."</p><p>"Ninja tricks," I said wryly. He wouldn't care for a technical explanation anyway. Civilians barely believed in chakra let alone understood how it worked.</p><p>The town was bustling, but not in a good way. There were beggars holding signs and raggedy children running about with no shoes on. People were just … standing about. And the shops were nearly empty. Only a few, pitiful examples of vegetables at outrageous prices. Tazuna brought the barest of minimum food that would feed seven people… and even then the price was beyond what it would cost to feed that many people in a respectable restaurant in Konoha.</p><p>I thought guiltily of the food packs stashed into my bag. Maybe I should share them? It was to feed us, after all.</p><p>We heard Naruto before we saw him. In order to master water walking, he had created a whole army of clones, running suicidally from dock at the back of the house onto the water. A large number by Naruto's was, by definition, <em> loud</em> . Still they were actually managing to get a fair way out before stumbling and falling in.</p><p>Sasuke looked equally wet and bedraggled, but there was only one of him. Like Naruto, he was also mostly capable of water walking. Once you had mastered the ability to channel out your feet, it was only a matter of adjusting <em> how</em> you were channelling. After learning tree walking, water walking was much easier.</p><p>"Hey," I greeted, standing on the dock to watch them. "How are you guys doing?"</p><p>"I've nearly got it, see?" A Naruto exclaimed, before wobbling and falling in. Three more cried out as his fall disturbed the water underneath them and they failed to compensate for it.</p><p>"It's… difficult," Sasuke said, diplomatically, frowning at the water.</p><p>"It feels very unstable, doesn't it?" I commiserated.</p><p>"Hn. How was the bridge?"</p><p>"No sign of either Zabuza or the Hunter-nin. I caught a bit of the local gossip about Gatou - seems he's really pushing the people lately; taxes, shipping tariffs, out and out extortion basically. He has a whole private army, too, made up of wannabe samurai and such."</p><p>"What a jerk," Naruto commented with a scowl.</p><p>"Yup," I replied. "The town is a mess too. This must have been going on for a while before Tazuna decided to start the bridge. It's horrible."</p><p>"Heh. Well, that's why we're here, right?" Naruto asked. "We're going to make sure it gets better." There was no hesitation in his voice, just sheer confidence. <em> This is how it's going to be. </em></p><p>I smiled brightly at him.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Waves Arc: Chapter 12</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Thank you everyone for the wonderful reviews. If you left questions, I try to reply to them with PM's. Still, there was one anonymous reviewer who made a point that I feel I should clarify - Kakashi's sharp interest in Shikako's post battle analysis wasn't a huge thing, it was just that (if you read it carefully) there was a small tidbit of information that hadn't been mentioned before; that Haku had come with Zabuza and was present for the whole fight. She knew it, we knew it, but it gave Kakashi a pause. Also the fact that she could <em> tell</em> he was there.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 12</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Before anything else, preparation is the key to success. ~Alexander Graham Bell</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The next day was more of the same. Sensei didn't want to teach us any new Jutsu. He thought it would be better if we simply worked on things that would help our chakra control and improve what we could already do.</p><p>I thought that he was maybe a little surprised at how quickly the boys had picked up water walking. They hadn't mastered it in a day, but they were adequate.</p><p>I, on the other hand, thought a week was a perfectly reasonable period of time to learn a new jutsu. Naruto, who learnt Shadow Clones in a matter of hours, and Sasuke, who had devoted himself to the Great Fireball Jutsu until he had mastered it, agreed with me.</p><p>Sensei's eye roved over our serious yet hopeful faces.</p><p>"Please teach us a cool jutsu," Naruto begged.</p><p>"There isn't really anything I can teach you that will enable you to match Zabuza," Kakashi-sensei said seriously. "So it'd be best if you mastered the skill you already have. You've done well to learn water walking and tree walking. There are a few more chakra control techniques you could do."</p><p>There were as many chakra control techniques as you had imagination, in fact.</p><p>"Sensei," I argued softly. "If the next attack comes at the bridge we'll be at a disadvantage. The concrete and steel nature of the deck means my earth jutsu will be limited to the amount of mud I can spit… and that isn't much. Sasuke's fire techniques are, well, useless when there's so much water around." I gave an apologetic shrug in his direction. "Is there anything that you could teach us that might be useful in such a situation? Even if it's just a trick?"</p><p>'Trick' was actually ninja slang for a chakra technique that wasn't well known or developed enough to qualify as a jutsu. Over a lifetime, most ninja invented or refined enough tricks to fill a whole jutsu library. And most of them were lost. They were tiny things; breathing underwater, fire sparks to light cigarettes, condensation to refill a canteen, body temperature adjustment on a hot day… things like that.</p><p>Sensei sighed. "Well, I suppose there's a minor lightning jutsu or two you <em> might</em> be able to pick up." He stressed the 'might'. He was probably assuming that we'd work out on our own that learning jutsu was more difficult than we thought.</p><p>Naruto cheered.</p><p>"Alright. Naruto, you're with Tazuna today. Leave a clone here with your team mates and I'll run you through the jutsu." Sensei looked like the thought of teaching us was more hassle than he wanted to contemplate. Yet there was a hit of something else… was he <em> pleased?</em></p><p>It was official. Kakashi-sensei made <em> no sense.</em></p><p>"Okay," Kakashi-sensei said later on, at the start of our lesson. We listened intently. "This is Lightning Release: Striking Bolt. It's a C-rank, short to mid range elemental jutsu. Be <em> careful</em> with it. Water conducts electricity, so it should work well against Zabuza and the Hunter-nin, but it will be just as easy for you to electrocute yourselves or each other."</p><p>There were four seals; ox for power, rabbit for control, bird for flight and monkey for lightning. Lightning crackled at his fingertips before leaping away, slamming into a nearby tree leaving scorch marks on the barks.</p><p>"You can direct it a little, but mostly it will target the nearest object in the direction you point it. The range is about five meters, give or take. If there's nothing to hit, it will either just ground out… or rebound to hit <em> you</em> ." He smiled cheerily. "So have fun learning. Try not to hit yourselves."</p><p>He vanished.</p><p>I felt like sweat dropping. "Eh… maybe we should spread out a bit. And maybe you," I pointed at the Naruto clone. "Should have more clones doing the jutsu so you don't cancel yourself. It wouldn't be good if Naruto tried to learn this on the bridge surrounded by metal and people…"</p><p>We spread out, close enough for shouting distance, far enough that we wouldn't accidentally attack each other and got to work.</p><p>The interplay between Lightning and Earth, as chakra natures, seemed counter intuitive. Lighting was grounded by Earth, so one would expect Earth to beat Lightning. Instead, it was the other way around.</p><p>That's because, when working with chakra, the physicality of the elements isn't the most important aspect; the chakra itself is. Earth Chakra is highly stable, filled with strong bonds between particles. It is most readily shaped for defence, and an army will <em> break</em> on a wall of Earth. Lightning Chakra, on the other hand, is highly agitated, overcharged, energetic. It overloads and shatters bonds.</p><p>Introducing Lightning Chakra to an Earth Jutsu will, therefore, cause the Earth Jutsu to collapse.</p><p>Which means as a natural Earth type, Lightning was the last thing my chakra wanted to form. It was the complete opposite in both form and ability.</p><p>But I had been the one to <em> ask</em> for a technique to learn, so no way was I going to give up.</p><p>By lunchtime I had achieved… not very much at all. The yelping and assorted curses flowing through the forest told me that Naruto was slightly ahead of me, but still well behind the 'controlling it' part.</p><p>It was a new experience for me, to have to struggle with my chakra like this. Maybe 'struggle' was the wrong word. That implied it was being uncooperative. That wasn't it. I was my chakra and my chakra was me… it was just that I wasn't succeeding as I was used to.</p><p>It used a lot of chakra too. My earth jutsu took a fair chunk, but even unfinished this jutsu took more because it wasn't my natural chakra nature.</p><p>I took a break. Maybe I'd go get some lunch and bring it out for the boys and wait for my reserves to recuperate.</p><p>That sounded like a good idea.</p><p>An hour later, I sat on the dock at the back of the house, swinging my feet and savouring my lunch. I'd given Tsunami a stash of my ration bars and the easing of some of the worry in her face had made it worth it. The boys were still working on the jutsu, barely breaking to scoff down the food that I'd brought them.</p><p>I hummed to myself, using my chakra to scoop up a ball of water. It was an easy trick. All you had to do was create a ball of chakra and hollow out the inside, leaving a thin shell. The water would be restrained inside, as long as you made the shell thick enough that it didn't leak, and didn't lose concentration.</p><p>This kind of thing… didn't use any chakra. What I emitted, I could reabsorb once I was done with it. It was slightly harder to control outside my body, but not by much. I spun the chakra into a hollow tube, like an enclosed straw filled with water. Currently, I could only make it about the width of my finger, but I was planning on eventually making it thin enough to be used as a pen. I could make it thicker, but thinner was harder.</p><p>It was highly mobile. I could use it like a whip or a staff, if I wanted. Water was non-compressible, so when I hit something with it, it would act as a solid. Providing that I didn't lose concentration. I'd never actually used it in a fight before.</p><p>I didn't actually know how to fight with either staves or whips - beyond the obvious 'hit them with it' - but as a chakra construct it negated a lot of the skill required. I hadn't been intending on using it, but having something solid between myself and Zabuza's huge sword sounded like a good idea. Using water against Haku was probably wasted effort, though, with his Ice blood limit.</p><p>I stepped out onto the water, twirling my construct like a staff.</p><p><em> Longer, shorter, rigid staff to flowing whip…</em></p><p>The lightning jutsu was the problem though. I <em> wanted</em> to learn it. I knew enough to know I'd probably never be a ninjutsu fighter, but that didn't mean I didn't want to learn jutsu. They were interesting. Fascinating. Magical. Not for what they did but for what they <em> were</em> .</p><p>And the fact that Sensei taught us it. I couldn't <em> not</em> learn it. What would he think? Would he ever give us anything to learn ever again?</p><p><em> So how to learn something that goes directly against my nature?</em></p><p>It was possible to learn elemental recombination for different elements. It wasn't really necessary for jutsu of this level, and I had no idea how to go about it anyway. Being able to use 'pure' elemental chakra made jutsu stronger, certainly but people could do elemental ninjutsu without being able to convert chakra to different elements.</p><p>That was the problem. Converting elements. My earth affinity didn't go to lightning.</p><p><em> Converting…</em></p><p>Something tickled the back of my mind. Converting. Changing from one form to another. Adapting. Altering. Transferring.</p><p>I frowned.</p><p><em> Transferring? Transfusion?</em></p><p>Part of the chakra transfusion jutsu <em> was</em> purifying chakra of its elemental affinity, yes. But that was other people's chakra… well no. I had used Naruto's because I didn't have much chakra. But you could use your own.</p><p>You'd still have to purify it then. So, there <em> was</em> a way to purify your own chakra of it's elemental affinity. Then you'd have base chakra to work with. I'd still have to convert it to lightning… but I wouldn't be trying to swim against the current, so to speak.</p><p>That was my plan then. I'd work on it this afternoon to see if it was viable.</p><p>Dinner came quickly. I'd made <em> some</em> progress on the Striking Bolt jutsu. Purifying chakra was something I already knew how to do, but using it on my own chakra, then holding that base chakra separate, <em> then</em> trying to use it in a jutsu was taxing. The process had to be repeated each time I tried to use the lightning jutsu, and it was time consuming.</p><p>The boys bolted their food down and raced back outside to keep practicing. Or, in Naruto's case, to finally start practicing, since he'd been complaining about how boring being at the bridge was. I wondered how strange it felt to be in two (or many) different places at once. It didn't seem to be affecting him negatively, so I shrugged it off.</p><p>"Not going to join them?" Kakashi-sensei asked, amused.</p><p>"My chakra supplies are low," I said with a yawn. "It'd be more efficient for me to rest and keep training in the morning."</p><p>That didn't stop me from casting a long look at the door though. More efficient, yes, but I had been <em> close</em> to getting it. I was sure.</p><p>The next day was Sasuke's turn to guard the bridge, while Sensei disappeared off to do whatever scouting Sensei did during the day, leaving me with Naruto. Naruto who had had dawn watch so was wide awake and <em> LOUD</em> while I was still blinking sleep out of my eyes.</p><p>" - was a boy, but he was prettier than Sakura-chan!" Naruto said, waving his chopsticks in the air. "That's so weird. He was looking for some herbs or something and he asked me if I was a ninja -"</p><p>His voice droned on. I blinked at him. Something about that was very familiar.</p><p>"- name was Haku, he was pretty neat, he asked me if I had precious people to protect …" His voice trailed off pensively.</p><p><em> Ah</em> . That was it. I couldn't work up the energy to be worried about it. Haku hadn't attacked him and it wasn't like Tazuna's location was secret or anything. The fact that Naruto <em> had</em> run into him meant that he hadn't got near the house, which was the whole point of the night watch. I couldn't fault Naruto for being friendly about it.</p><p>"Do you?" I asked, picking at my breakfast.</p><p>"Do I what?" Naruto repeated, snapping out of his thoughts.</p><p>"Have precious people to protect?" That was a bit of a tongue twister.</p><p>He looked startled, but grinned. "Of course! There's the old man and Iruka-sensei and the Ichirakus and you and I guess even Sasuke and Kakashi-sensei…"</p><p><em> Me?</em> I blinked, ignoring the warm feeling in my chest. "Well, I guess we better go start training, so we can do that protecting."</p><p>Inari gave a snort, but we both ignored it. I wasn't really in the mood for one of his <em> resistance is futile</em> talks.</p><p>The week passed. Sasuke, unsurprisingly, ended up with the strongest lightning attack which led me to believe that his secondary affinity <em> was</em> lightning, and it probably wasn't much weaker than his fire affinity. Naruto's attack was weaker, comparatively, and less controlled, but since he had so much chakra he could throw more of them. My attack was decent, but the amount of time it took me to mould and convert my chakra to use it was much longer than either of theirs. Long enough to be a risk in battle.</p><p>"Well done, team," Sensei said. "I must admit, I didn't actually expect you all to learn that." He smiled cheerily. We all stared back smugly. Exceeding his expectations felt <em> good</em> . "Alright then. Tomorrow is the most likely time for Zabuza to attack. By now he should have healed from the near death state the Hunter-nin put him in. That said, all of us are going to be accompanying Tazuna to the bridge tomorrow."</p><p>It seemed that Sensei did think that Zabuza was going to stage a confrontation. We exchanged <em> looks</em> , half anticipation, half excitement, half dread. We'd been expecting an attack through the whole week and it had been tiring. It finally have it in sight…</p><p>We prepared carefully in the morning, amped for the coming fight.</p><p>"Maybe Naruto should leave a few clones by the house," I suggested before we were about to leave. "To make sure they don't come after Inari and Tsunami." Hostage situations were tense and unnerving and very rarely had a good outcome.</p><p>"Good thinking," Naruto said, creating a few clones to guard the house. Some of them stayed obvious, others hid themselves in the forest.</p><p>Tazuna eyed us all warily. "You sure about this?"</p><p>"Fairly sure," I tried to smile reassuringly at him. I'm not sure it really worked.</p><p>"… I don't pretend to know about being a ninja, but shouldn't we avoid walking into a trap?" Tazuna asked doubtfully.</p><p>"The trap you know about is less dangerous than the trap you don't," Sasuke recited easily. "Springing an obvious trap is a chance to turn it back against the ambusher."</p><p>"Don't worry, old man! You've got Naruto Uzumaki with you! We're going to win this!" Naruto grinned, fierce and sharp. "Zabuza doesn't stand a chance against us!"</p><p>As we closed in on the bridge, I felt it. There was no need to race ahead to check.</p><p>"They're here."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Waves Arc: Chapter 13</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - thanks for the wonderful review and for pointing out discrepancy. I just realised I forgot to close that plot point properly. Yes they do know, and assume it either got better with age, or she's just working through it on sheer stubbornness. I'll try and address the issue somewhere along the line, though it probably wont be till after the Wave Arc. And to all reviewers, questions are always welcome, because sometimes I don't even realise I've missed things. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 13</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Betrayal is the only truth that sticks. ~ Arthur Miller</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"They're here."</p><p>My heart pounded and my pulse raced. I smiled grimly.</p><p><em> Time to dance. </em></p><p>Kakashi-sensei was the only one who could take Zabuza. One of us needed to guard Tazuna. That left two for Haku and that was assuming they hadn't brought anyone else with them. What combinations would work best?</p><p>My first instinct was to place myself with Tazuna. I'd already noted that Shadow Jutsu were good for body guarding. But I could remember, vaguely, what Naruto and Sasuke had been hit with. It had not gone well.</p><p>Calling senbon hard to kill with was a bit of an exaggeration. In the end, they were 20cm of pointy metal. Aimed with slightly less precision, Sasuke might have actually died.</p><p>But his speed and Sharingan were probably our greatest asset against Haku's speed. I was fairly fast, particularly if I boosted my speed with chakra, but I didn't think I'd be able to match Haku's mirrors. But Naruto had been the one to get through to him, to commiserate with him.</p><p>The bridge loomed eerily out of the fog. Land of Waves had a lot of fog, but even at a distance I could tell this fog was imbued with chakra. It was Zabuza's Hiding in the Mist Technique.</p><p>We walked forward. Trap or no trap, we needed to face them.</p><p>"What the-?" Tazuna gasped seeing his men spread out, lying lifelessly on the bridge. It was a creepy scene, as though we had just walked in on the middle of a massacre. <em> Intimidation tactics again</em> .</p><p>"They're alive," I said quietly, seeking out their chakra. It was weak - civilian level - but pulsing steadily. "Just knocked out." That was another mark in our favour. Killing the bridge workers would stop it being built just as surely as killing Tazuna.</p><p>Whatever Zabuza's true goals were, they weren't as obvious as he proclaimed.</p><p>"Well, well. You just couldn't wait for round two, could you?" Kakashi-sensei said to the open air, a hint of black humour in his voice. The fact was, after merely a week, Zabuza couldn't <em> possibly</em> be on top form, while Kakashi-sensei was completely recovered.</p><p>"Sorry to keep you waiting, Kakashi," Zabuza rasped, voice coming from everywhere at once. It was still hard to sense with the mist covering chakra signatures, but I had experience at it now. He was circling us at a distance, looking for an opening. "I see you've still got those brats with you."</p><p>"Sa…" Kakashi-sensei acknowledged, with a tilt of his head. "They kind of grow on you. Like a fungus." He added helpfully, completely shattering the affection his previous statement had built.</p><p>"Fungus!" Naruto spluttered, indignant. "Who are you calling a fungus?"</p><p>"Gee, sensei," I said dryly. "Love you too."</p><p>Sasuke gave a disapproving 'hn', though whether it was for Sensei's comment, or simply the silly banter I didn't know.</p><p>Zabuza chuckled. "Don't worry, I'm prepared for you this time." His voice came in stereo, as shapes started moving in the fog. Two, then three then six then finally ten identical forms surrounding us at a distance. They were arranged in a circle, covering all directions, with enough room between them to swing their swords - and far enough away that they could see my shadow coming.</p><p>"Water clones," I said under my breath. "All of them. Real ones at one o'clock, one hundred fifty meters off Sensei." Using Sensei as a marker point, Zabuza and Haku were straight ahead and slightly to the right. The rest of us had automatically moved to box Tazuna in and were facing different directions, hence why I had to specify who I was marking off.</p><p>We were all eager to leap into battle but the way that the clones were spread out one person wouldn't be able to take them all. But if all three of us went to fight, the real Zabuza and Haku could take on Sensei and Tazuna.</p><p>"Clones for clones?" Sasuke suggested.</p><p>Sasuke willingly standing back to let Naruto attack? That was surprising. Good strategy, but surprising all the same. On the other hand, I was glad that <em> I</em> didn't have to suggest it.</p><p>I could <em> hear</em> Kakashi-sensei smile. "You heard the man, Naruto. Think you're up for it?"</p><p>"Oh, yeah!" Naruto growled. "I've been waiting for this. Shadow Clone Jutsu!"</p><p>He didn't spam out clones. There were only about twice as many as Zabuza had water clones. They attacked with what was one of the most basic combinations - distract and takedown. One clone would attack to form an opening - either with taijutsu, thrown kunai or Striking Bolt - which the other would then take. The clones that succeeded would then turn to help their neighbours. Some of the initial attacks hit and some of the clones were sacrificed outright but Naruto seemed to be rapidly learning how to dodge giant sword swings.</p><p>All in all, it was a fairly successful blitz attack. Of course, even with the clones destroyed, that still left us encircled by water. That was something to keep an eye on.</p><p>"Even if those clones were merely a tenth of the strength of your original water clone… it is still impressive that he managed to take them all out, Zabuza-sama," a second, perfectly calm voice said. The Hunter-nin. Haku.</p><p>There was a blur of body flicker speed, and both Zabuza and Haku appeared in front of our team. The fog swirled around them, disturbed by the sudden movement. Haku was still wearing the Hunter-nin mask, taunting us with the fact that we believed his lies in our last encounter.</p><p>"So I had it right," Kakashi-sensei said, unsurprised. His ability to remain casually conversational even after being attacked was enviable. "It was all an act."</p><p>"So, all that about being a tracker ninja protecting his village was a lie?" Tazuna asked warily.</p><p>"They look pretty chummy to me," Kakashi-sensei agreed. "I'd say they've been pulling scams like that for a long time. And hiding behind that mask, who does he think he's fooling?" Kakashi-sensei's tone was congenial and completely false. The irony of that comment.</p><p>"Certainly not you, sensei," I agreed. The high tension of battle appeared to bring out my snarky side. I hadn't been aware I had one.</p><p><em> You learn something new everyday…</em></p><p>Still, I was perfectly content to follow Kakashi-sensei's lead on this. If he wanted to do pre-battle banter, we could do pre-battle banter. Another history lesson or exposition dump would have been nice though…</p><p>"Heh, he thinks he's got you all worked out, Haku," Zabuza rasped, looking at his companion. Like Kakashi-sensei he appeared to be completely at ease with the situation. I guess it was something that came with experience.</p><p>"Haku?" Naruto repeated uncertainly. He recognised the name. I wasn't surprised. That one conversation made a big impact on him. <em> Protecting precious people</em> was an idea that resonated deeply within him. He had trained harder than ever after than conversation and repeated those words to Inari with deep conviction.</p><p>The Hunter-nin removed his mask, showing a surprisingly pretty face. "Hello again, Naruto. I told you we would meet again soon."</p><p>"You were there… on purpose?" Naruto asked, off balance. There was a hint of vulnerability in his voice, as if expecting Haku's wisdom and kindness to have been lies.</p><p>Haku smiled softly. "No. I was really just gathering herbs. It was just lucky coincidence that we ran into each other."</p><p>"But… you're such a nice person! Why are you working for that jerk Gatou?" Naruto was distressed, I could tell. But I hoped that this conversation would lead to a revelation… or a resolution.</p><p>Haku flinched and dropped his eyes from Naruto's searching gaze. "It is not pleasant. But in this world of shinobi… we must do things which we do not enjoy in order to further our own dreams. Gatou is… a necessary evil."</p><p>"He's destroying this country!" Naruto shouted back. "The people… the kids… They're all in trouble because of him! Without this bridge, they'll all starve!"</p><p>We'd all seen it, walking around the village. People were <em> already</em> starving and things were only getting worse.</p><p>"Please don't hate me. I, too, want to protect someone precious to me. To work for that person. To fight for that person. To make that person's dreams come true. That is my dream. For that I became a shinobi. For that reason… I will do these things…" His voice trailed off into a murmur, dropping from the strident tones he had begun with.</p><p>"Haku is my tool," Zabuza cut in, leaning on his sword menacingly. "He'll do as he's told."</p><p>That just <em> incensed </em> Naruto. He clenched his fists. "A tool? A tool? What kind of explanation is that? He just said he'd work for your dreams and all you call him is a tool?" He nearly leapt for Zabuza, all his muscles tensed.</p><p>"Naruto," Kakashi-sensei said, voice soothing. "Stay calm. Remember our mission. We have to protect Tazuna, so you can't go getting angry like that."</p><p>"I am happy to be Zabuza-sama's tool," Haku said honestly. "It gives my life meaning. In this world… there is nothing more painful than being an unwanted person…"</p><p>"Unwanted…" Naruto repeated quietly.</p><p>"When I met you in that forest," Haku continued, "I knew we were the same. I knew that you would understand this… If you met someone who acknowledged you so completely… would you not do anything to make them happy?"</p><p>"It's still not right," Naruto argued. "You can find other reasons. And why's Zabuza got to do this anyway?"</p><p>"Care to shed a little light, Zabuza?" Kakashi-sensei commented lightly, but his eye was watchful.</p><p>Zabuza snorted. "For the money. Why else?" He hefted his huge sword onto his shoulder. "All this talking… it's not achieving anything. Give up the bridge builder."</p><p>"We can't do that, I'm afraid," Kakashi-sensei retorted pleasantly. "But we don't have to fight. You could still leave."</p><p>Offer and counter offer. Both refused.</p><p><em> Didn't expect anything else, really</em> ,I thought.</p><p>"Haku." Zabuza didn't add anything else, but it was enough. Haku sprang into action, straight for us.</p><p>I had considered many plans of action when it came to this situation. I had created many tactics and discarded many more.</p><p>But I had overlooked one crucial, tiny factor.</p><p>I hadn't told my team mates.</p><p>"We got this!" Sasuke growled, leaping forward.</p><p>I watched helplessly as the two boys charged Haku. I wanted to grab them, to drag them back and make them listen to me. I couldn't. There was no time anymore.</p><p><em> Shit. Note to self; communication is key.</em></p><p>Naruto and Sasuke worked as a good team, surprisingly. Sasuke was the main force of the attack, engaging Haku's attention while Naruto flittered about, distracting, creating openings, preventing Haku from taking advantage of Sasuke's mistakes.</p><p>The thing is, Taijutsu fights don't go down like in DBZ or anything. There isn't an exchange of blows, perfectly blocked, that lasts five episodes. Usually it's over pretty quickly, as one overpowers or out thinks the other. Then everyone has to step up their game.</p><p>Haku was thrown backwards.</p><p>He flipped back to his feet easily. "I don't want to have to kill you," he said, a frown creasing his brow, "but you wont stand down, will you?"</p><p>Sasuke snorted. "Don't be foolish."</p><p>"You're the one losing," Naruto added.</p><p>"I see. You two make a formidable opponent. However, do not think that you can match my true skills." He drew senbon, holding them between his fingers like Wolverine claws. We'd already seen what Haku could do with those needles.</p><p>"You're not as fast as you think. From this point on, you'll be the one defending from our attacks," Sasuke said, landing on one side of him while Naruto landed on the other. He was trapped between them for now. "Thought you were quicker, huh? Now what else are you wrong about?"</p><p>"You made a bit of a mistake, insulting these ninja and calling them brats," Sensei said casually, giving the impression he was only half paying attention to the fight. "That's just guaranteed to bring out Sasuke's attitude, and he's the best young fighter of the Hidden Leaf."</p><p>Sensei's phrasing was interesting. 'Young fighter'. Not Rookie of the year, not Genin. Just how good did Sensei think Sasuke was? I already knew we weren't average. None of our year was. It was hard to keep it in perspective sometimes, but Rookie 9 was extraordinary.</p><p>"Shikako here is definitely our sharpest mind. And Naruto… our most unpredictable ninja." The praise was nice, even if it wasn't completely truthful. Shika was smarter than I was but I didn't expect Kakashi-sensei to know that.</p><p>"Haku," Zabuza ordered over his shoulder, unimpressed. "Stop playing around."</p><p>"…Of course, Zabuza-sama," Haku acknowledged. He threw the senbon and raced through a set of hand seals. "Ice Release: Ice Foundation!" The water beneath his feet iced over and raced out, covering a circular area around him. Both Naruto and Sasuke moved quickly to avoid having their legs frozen, jumping on top of it but had problems gaining stability on the ice. Either the slippery surface made the chakra formation subtlety different from tree walking, or it's nature as a chakra construct prevented them from doing it at all.</p><p><em> Clever</em> . He'd reduced their speed and manoeuvrability while increasing his own.</p><p>"Ice…?" Sensei said, eye widening. "That's…"</p><p>"A Bloodlimit," Zabuza said in satisfaction. "Your brats… don't stand a chance against Haku."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei made an aborted movement, like he wanted to go towards them. Zabuza's sword cut through his intended path.</p><p>"Hey Kakashi. Your opponent … is me. If you want to go towards them… I'll get by you and kill those two."</p><p>I didn't rate my chances against Zabuza well… but I didn't like his utterly dismissive attitude. I started partitioning off and purifying a portion of my chakra, just enough for one lightning jutsu. Just in case. I wouldn't go down easy.</p><p>"You're underestimating them," Kakashi-sensei said. "They're better than you think. But… if you insist…" he withdrew a kunai from his leg holster, one hand going to raise his headband.</p><p>"The Sharingan again? Is that the only trick you have? A shinobi's supreme technique shouldn't be shown to the enemy over and over again."</p><p>"You should feel lucky," Kakashi-sensei replied. "You're the only one who's seen it twice."</p><p>Zabuza smirked and just when it looked like the two of them were going to clash… faded back. "Hidden in the Mist Jutsu!"</p><p>The fog rushed in, even thicker than before. "I'm starting to hate this technique," I decided. Naruto, Sasuke and Haku were completely out of sight. I could barely see <em> myself</em> .</p><p><em> Irritating.</em></p><p>Sensei chuckled. "Be on guard," he suggested. Like I was going to be anything else.</p><p>"Last time we fought," Zabuza's voiced echoed out of the mist. That really was a neat trick. I needed to learn how to do that. "You used your Sharingan to see right through me. But with this mist… you can't see a thing, can you? This mist is as familiar to me as the training grounds in the Bloody Mist Village… but to you it must be a pathway to hell." He laughed. "Next time you see me, it will be the end."</p><p>"You're awfully confident," Kakashi-sensei mused. Completely healed and with full chakra reserves, he was more willing to draw this confrontation out than he might otherwise have been. I think that he had a fair bit of confidence in us too, as individuals and as a team.</p><p>I closed my eyes, ignoring the white mists swirling in front of me and focusing on my chakra sense. I used the point of my kunai to indicate where Zabuza was moving. I could feel, further off, Naruto and Sasuke fighting Haku. There was a lot of chakra being thrown around, but I couldn't tell who was winning. I couldn't even hear them.</p><p>"You have fast reflexes," Zabuza said, as shuriken clashed. "But it wont save you forever, Kakashi."</p><p>He kept moving soundlessly through the mist. I tracked him, pointing his position for Sensei and trying to keep myself between him and Tazuna.</p><p>Zabuza tried a few attacks. Kunai, shuriken, Water Bullets, counting on the changing directions of attack to make up for their simplicity. They didn't work. Sensei deflected the incoming projectiles with ease, even raising a brief wind blast to destroy the Water Bullets.</p><p>"You have some skill," Zabuza said grudgingly.</p><p>"Sharingan isn't the only thing I know," Kakashi-sensei replied with slight amusement. "You don't last this long with only one skill."</p><p>So Zabuza didn't know I could sense him. I was glad about it and grateful Kakashi-sensei didn't feel like alerting him. If he did know… he'd probably target me too. Not something I was looking forward too. I was happy to stand in the shadows… if that wasn't too cliché.</p><p>And of course, just when you start thinking things are going well… is when they invariably turn to shit.</p><p>"SASUKE!" Naruto <em> screamed.</em></p><p>It wasn't an annoyed 'Sasuke', as in 'you idiot'. It wasn't a frustrated 'Sasuke, why did you do that?'. It wasn't even a warning 'Sasuke, get down'.</p><p>It was worry, and fear. And just a little bit of disbelief.</p><p>"I'LL KILL YOU!"</p><p>Then came the nightmare.</p><p>I froze. That chakra…</p><p>Red and malevolent and angry and <em> evil</em> … yes, I knew that chakra. I had felt it before.</p><p>I needed to… I needed to move…</p><p><em> There was only darkness. I was small and helpless, lost and confused and alone and trapped in a body that would not, could not respond to my helpless panicked thoughts. I could hear a child, a baby, screaming but it wasn't me because I couldn't move, couldn't breathe couldn't do anything but lie still and hope we were hidden and please, please don't notice me…</em></p><p><em> Please, please, please…</em></p><p>I gasped, choking for air, for breath, for anything…</p><p>Later, when it had been explained to me, I would know that Kakashi-sensei had blasted the mist away with a powerful wind jutsu when he had sensed the seal weakening. Naruto had utterly <em> destroyed </em> Haku's Ice attacks, the Kyuubi chakra giving him enhanced speed and healing and the bubbling chakra acting like a shield. He had knocked Haku around, beating him down and nearly killed him. His rage had been short lived, though, in face of Haku's utter despair at being so overmatched.</p><p>Zabuza had been blasted with the wind jutsu and retreated further back down the bridge. He had grabbed Haku and once again the two of them were facing off against us. Only… Naruto was hunched over in the middle of the bridge, frozen in an attack pose, tears leaking down his face.</p><p>Sasuke was… Sasuke was lying limp in the middle of the remains of what looked like a field of mirrors. His chakra was diminished, but there.</p><p>That was the scene I returned to.</p><p>Mechanically, I picked up the kunai that I had dropped, distantly grateful that it hadn't gone through my foot.</p><p>"Naruto," I rasped, then coughed. My jaw ached, my throat felt raw. I swallowed, tasting the bitter acid of fear. "Naruto. Grab Sasuke and bring him here."</p><p>Naruto stared at me blankly for a long moment, before turning and making his way over to Sasuke. No one else moved.</p><p>It was a long journey back to us. Every step weighed down heavily on him. I could almost see him ageing as he walked.</p><p>Then gently, ever so gently, he lay Sasuke on the ground at my feet.</p><p>I swallowed and briefly closed my eyes. Those senbon… they had gone right through his neck. There was another straight through his wrist… and his back… and more besides…</p><p><em> Shit. If I didn't know…</em> If I didn't know he was alive, I'd think he was dead, simply from the sheer amount of metal in him.</p><p>Carefully, I knelt and touched the ones around his neck. Kakashi-sensei loomed above us like an angry presence, eyes scorching into Zabuza and Haku. Having seen Kakashi-sensei swear to protect us… I didn't want to think about what he would do if one of us was truly dead.</p><p><em> Tnk. Tnk. Tnk.</em></p><p>The thin metal needles clattered on the concrete floor. The sound was obscenely loud in the sudden silence.</p><p>Tazuna sucked in a breath. "Is he…" he asked, half afraid of the answer.</p><p>"He… will be fine," I said, trying to inject confidence into my voice. This technique was something I knew nothing about. But his chakra was still there, a tiny burning ember in his heart, strong enough to roar back to life.</p><p>Naruto let out a sobbing cry, reaching for another senbon.</p><p>I stood, letting him continue that work, guiltily glad to turn away from the bloodied wreck of my team mate.</p><p>For a second, I spread my chakra sense wide, trying to see if there was anyone else in the area. I didn't have much range, which was something I knew I needed to work on.</p><p><em> Damn. Gatou came here… didn't he?</em></p><p>The problem with trying to remember… was that it was all so long ago. Memories naturally degrade with age, even those you try and remember.</p><p>I wondered if Gatou had some means of observing us. Scouts or binoculars or something of the kind. If that was the case, we'd have to get into a situation where one side appeared to lose.</p><p><em> Tough call</em> .</p><p>Especially if Sensei didn't want to play anymore.</p><p>Because even with his mask… it was easy to tell that he was angry. It rolled off him in waves, like chakra, like Killing Intent, like heat. If you stood too close, you'd burn.</p><p>"I'm sorry Zabuza-sama," Haku said quietly, bowing his head. "I was unable to become the weapon you sought. I was … unable to defeat that boy. There is no reason for a weak shinobi such as I to exist."</p><p>"You've always been too soft, Haku," Zabuza said, hefting his sword again. "What's the matter, Kakashi? Haku kill one of your brats? Anyway, I'm about to send you all to the same place as him. You can apologise in the next world for not being strong enough to protect them."</p><p>Anger <em> spiked.</em></p><p>Tazuna's bridge had odd sides. There was a raised lip, like a foot path or a bench, on top of which the railings sat. That extra height cast shadows, even now when it was nearly noon. There was a crane, half loaded with steel beams for the days work at the end of the bridge. It was positioned almost perfectly behind me.</p><p>They knew I was a Nara. They should have been watching for it. That they weren't was … disappointing.</p><p>My shadows ghosted down the side of the bridge and circled behind them, latching on silently.</p><p>"Shadow Paralysis Complete." I preferred the older form of the Jutsu, the one that paralysed instead of mimicked. It was simply easier when I didn't have to account for my opponent moving.</p><p>Almost in tandem Sensei and I raced forward. Zabuza swore.</p><p>I tackled Haku to the ground, knees bracketing his sides and pinning his hands down while I had a kunai to his throat. Sensei deprived Zabuza of his weapons, twisted his arms hard up against his back and slammed him face first into the pavement. Hard.</p><p>At this range, with touch, Shadow Paralysis was easy to hold. I don't know what Sensei was using, but he was bound to know a few tricks.</p><p>"Sasuke isn't dead, is he?" I asked Haku, not quite able to keep the urgency out of my voice. "You used the same needle trick you used on Zabuza on him, didn't you?"</p><p>He swallowed; the facial muscles are some of the few that the Shadow Jutsu doesn't paralyse. "If I say no, will you kill me?"</p><p>It was a little heartbreaking, if I'd been a more empathetic person. He would rather die than disappoint Zabuza, even a little bit.</p><p>I considered it. "No. But I'll probably cry." It wouldn't spark rage in me like it did in Naruto. Besides, I <em> knew</em> Sasuke wasn't dead. I could feel his chakra pulsing like a banked ember. I just… needed to know that he'd be okay.</p><p>There was a large difference between alive and alright.</p><p>Then I felt it.</p><p>"Incoming! Chakra signs from the east! At least fifty, civilian level!" The east was out over the water. They were coming by boat.</p><p>Sensei made a sound that might have been a swearword. "Backup, Zabuza?"</p><p>The boat was swift and silent and docked easily. If we hadn't had warning, if the mist had still been up, we could have missed it. The men disembarked. My guess had been close to accurate, and they were all mercenaries, bar for one.</p><p><em> Tap. Tap. Tap.</em></p><p>His cane tapped against the floor. He was short, with wild hair and glasses. He was dressed in a pretentious suit. Immediately, I suspected who it was.</p><p>"Oooh, you're getting your ass kicked, how disappointing," he mocked.</p><p><em> What an idiot.</em> You should at least make sure your ninja opponents are heavily injured before you start insulting them.</p><p>"Gatou. Why are you here?" Zabuza grunted sounding annoyed. "And what's with all these men?"</p><p>"Hehe, the plan has changed," Gatou said. Then he seemed to consider. "Well, actually, I planned to do this from the beginning. Zabuza, I'm going to have you killed here."</p><p><em> No, seriously. An idiot.</em></p><p>"What?" Zabuza barked, straining against Sensei's hold.</p><p>Gatou seemed only too pleased to elaborate, rubbing Zabuza's face in his victory. "I never planned on paying you any money. Hiring normal ninja from a village is expensive, and they may betray me. So I get missing-nin who are easy to take care of afterwards. I have the ninja battle each other, and once they're weakened, I kill them off with numbers." I wondered just how many times he'd done this… and to what calibre ninja. Fifty men after a long battle would do me in… but Sensei would probably survive it. "It doesn't cost me anything. Good plan, don't you think? The only problem with this plan was you, Zabuza. The Devil of the Hidden Mist? What a joke if you ask me. You're just a cute little baby devil."</p><p>Haku's face below me was shocked.</p><p>"Well, in that case," I drawled, shrugging and spinning my kunai to reholster it. I stood, releasing my jutsu and offering him a hand. Numbly, he took it and I hauled him to his feet. It looked like a truce had been declared.</p><p>"We can kill you easy," one of the thugs boasted.</p><p>"Kakashi, this fight is over," Zabuza snarled. "Now that I have no reason to go after Tazuna, I have no reason to fight you."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei considered, logic overriding his rage. "Very well."</p><p>There was a ripple of unease in the crowd as Zabuza stood and picked up Kubikiri Bocho. Yes, he and Haku had some injuries, and yes, there was blood smeared on them… but it wasn't excessive by any means.</p><p>But they weren't clever enough to know that they were getting in over their heads.</p><p>"I didn't like you from the day I set foot here," Zabuza spat. "And I especially dislike those who go back on their word." He levelled his sword at the group. "I think I'll enjoy killing you."</p><p>Gatou's eyes flickered madly, landing on me. "Isn't he your enemy?"</p><p>What, did I look easy to manipulate just because I was a girl? "Nah, not really. Just because we were fighting doesn't mean we're enemies. Besides," I said offhandedly. "You're the one threatening our client, so this works out best for us."</p><p>"Get them!" Gatou ordered. There was a clattering of metal, as swords were drawn.</p><p>Then Naruto stood, raising his chin and glaring at Gatou. "You know… we've got reinforcements too."</p><p>"That's right!" Another, familiar voice shouted. Inari? "If you come any further onto this island, the citizens of this country will stop you with everything we've got!"</p><p>It <em> was</em> Inari. And four Naruto clones, backed by half the population of Wave Country carrying crossbows and pitchforks and shovels and … frying pans?</p><p>I smirked, bemused.</p><p>Then it was on. Melee. Mayhem. Madness. That was the only word for it. I couldn't keep track of what was going happening. My shadow lashed out, freezing fighters where they stood. I blocked a sword with my kunai, threw a brace of shuriken, kicked someone in the groin, clawed someone across the face. There were Naruto's dancing through the combat, hitting and taking hits and popping into smoke. There was ice and water and Sensei flickering in and out of eyesight. The villagers had charged.</p><p>It was chaos. It was terrifying.</p><p>And Zabuza was tearing through the thugs like a demon. There was… a genjutsu? No, it was his chakra solidified and projected into the terrifying shape of a demons head, towering above the bridge. Gatou cowered and tried to run but there was no where to go. He had no escape from the Devil trying to send him to hell.</p><p>Then it stopped. Men lay groaning, lay dieing. The villagers stumbled back, shock and disbelief and <em> hope</em> and <em> pride</em> in their faces. They had fought for their homes. They had <em> won</em> .</p><p>And Sasuke was sitting up.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Waves Arc: Chapter 14</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: It kinda surprised me how many people are looking forward to the Chunin Exam Arc. I guess that <em> is </em> the next Canon Station we have to pass through…</p><p>Merry Christmas everyone!</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 14</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood. ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Sasuke was sitting up.</p><p>I wove my way through the crowds back to him, not quite able to stem the traitorous tears that rose to my eyes. The battle was over, the shock and detachment fading and everything was starting to catch up to me.</p><p>I knelt next to him, relief at seeing him well coursing through me. "Hi," I whispered inanely.</p><p>He blinked at me. "What happened?"</p><p>"We won?" I offered uncertainly. How to explain all this? "Gatou is dead. He betrayed Zabuza and Haku, so they aren't fighting us anymore."</p><p>"Huh," he said. All that had happened while he was out of it, so yeah, he was probably confused.</p><p>"You probably shouldn't be moving," I said, using my diagnosis technique to scan him. He actually didn't seem too badly off, surprisingly. I was wary of the damage to his neck, but other than that it all seemed very minor. Most of the senbon had lodged in his ribs, not penetrating into the lungs or heart. He'd take a few to the arms and legs, but they'd gone through muscle and missed the major arteries that could have made him bleed out.</p><p>"I thought…" Sasuke trailed off.</p><p><em> I thought I was dead.</em></p><p>"So did we," I said softly, activating my Mystical Palm Jutsu and beginning to heal up the most pressing of his injuries. It was slow going but doable, since senbon were very thin and only left small holes. I was grateful that my first excursion into post battle healing didn't involve gaping wounds or mortal injuries.</p><p>When I had done what I could, I looked up. Sensei and Zabuza were walking amongst the fallen forms of Gatou's men. And if they paid particular attention to one or another and then that form stopped moving or groaning in pain… I pretended not to see.</p><p>Naruto was with the villagers and Inari, basking in post fight excitement. I could see a few injuries on the villagers that I'd probably deal with soon.</p><p>But first… "Haku!" My voice didn't carry well, but he heard me all the same. He was standing awkwardly off to the side, just watching. At my call, he made his way over to us.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Could you please tell me about the attack you used?" I asked over Sasuke's scowl and wary look. I didn't know what had gone down between them while I hadn't been able to see and part of me cynically thought I was being overly trusting.</p><p>Haku knelt gracefully and folded his hands in his lap. "The senbon induce a temporary death state, by stopping breathing, pulse and nervous system activity for a short period of time. The first senbon pierces the vertebral column between the 3rd and 4th cervical vertebra, which stops movement and breathing. The next targets the external carotid artery, preventing blood flow to the brain and inducing unconsciousness as well as blocking movement to prevent the pulse from being taken. The third senbon targets the third cervical tenketsu point, shutting down the chakra system but at the same time allowing for reanimation after a short period of time."</p><p>By those directions, the needles in Sasuke's neck had been precisely in place. It was a little horrifying, as part of my brain insisted that such a thing was not possible - piercing the spinal cord, blocking an artery… all that would lead to was death. But chakra… that was the confounding aspect.</p><p>"And side effects?" I asked carefully.</p><p>Haku acknowledged the point. "The second senbon can often cause excessive bleeding, either escaping through the wound or remaining internal, particularly if it isn't removed carefully." There was a carefully blank look and a slight flicker of the eyes towards Zabuza. Likely that observation came through experience. "There is a degree of muscle paralysis or weakness that can persist for about a week, as well as symptoms similar to chakra exhaustion as the chakra system reboots."</p><p>"I see," I said, hands hovering over Sasuke's neck for a second longer. There was no excess bleeding that I could find and I couldn't fix the other factors. I let my hands drop. "Thank you for not killing my team mate."</p><p>Haku looked startled and dropped his gaze. "I… I did not wish to kill them," he admitted. "It is a failing of mine but…"</p><p>I tried to smile but I'm not sure it worked, covered in exhaustion and sadness. "I don't think it's much of a failing."</p><p>"A tool that does not work is useless, as is a shinobi who will not kill," Haku said. He looked as sad as I felt. "My very reason for existing is to be a tool for Zabuza-sama. Without that… I am nothing."</p><p>I couldn't help myself. I reached over and lightly touched his hand. "You don't believe that, Haku," I said earnestly. "And more importantly, Zabuza doesn't believe it either."</p><p>He gaped. "How can you say that?"</p><p>"Because I'm alive," I answered evenly. I wasn't good with heartfelt words, not like Naruto, but I could do facts. "If he truly believed Shinobi were supposed to kill without emotion, he wouldn't have spared us. That fight, with the water clone… the three of us didn't stand a chance, but he never aimed to kill. Beat us down, defeat us, yes, but not kill. Even here on this bridge…"</p><p>"I…" he looked torn between wanting to believe and what he thought he knew. "That is what I have always been taught. Shinobi are simply tools."</p><p>"Maybe he wants to believe it," I offered. "If you were only a tool, then it wouldn't hurt so much if you were used, like what happened here…. Maybe he wanted to spare you that pain."</p><p>He smiled wanly. "Maybe."</p><p>I let the matter drop. "You're bleeding. Do you want me to…?" I offered, activating my Mystical Palm Jutsu again.</p><p>He hesitated a second, just long enough for me to realise how forward I was being, then tilted his head back to let me heal it. "You didn't have to," he said awkwardly. "I've got salve for things like that."</p><p>I shrugged. "Cuts are pretty easy to fix. Don't worry about it. What kind of salve do you use?" I asked purely out of curiosity. It was a semi-safe topic for a conversation anyway.</p><p>We were just settling into a conversation about the properties of salves made out of coastal plants verse stuff made out of inland growing plants - which Sasuke was ignoring - when Naruto came jogging over.</p><p>"Hey!" He greeted cheerfully, but his eyes lingered on Sasuke longer than normal. "Some of the guys that came to help are injured, and they said that there isn't a doctor here anymore…" He trailed off.</p><p>I remembered hearing something like that. "I'll see what I can do," I said, standing and brushing dirt from my pants.</p><p>"I can help," Haku offered. "If it can make up for…"</p><p>"That would be appreciated," I accepted. Anything more serious than cuts and bruises I couldn't really deal with. A second set of hands wouldn't hurt in any case. "Maybe you two should see what Sensei has to say?"</p><p>"Hn," Sasuke said, which might have translated to anything from 'good idea' to 'I can't move'.</p><p>The villagers had actually managed to escape serious injury. There were a few cuts and stab wounds, which were easy to deal with, and a few broken bones, which I could do nothing more than splint. There <em> was</em> a Jutsu that could knit bone together, but I didn't know it and I didn't really want to experiment.</p><p>They left the bridge slowly, in groups of two or three, in high spirits until it was only us ninja left.</p><p>We grouped together, an invisible battle line drawn between our two teams. Yeah, there really wasn't a whole lot of trust going on here. I couldn't really fault anyone for that. An hour ago we'd been doing our best to kill each other.</p><p>Well. Sort of.</p><p>"So what are your plans now?" Kakashi-sensei asked casually.</p><p>Zabuza grunted. "A company as big as that wont disappear just because we killed the guy in charge. It might take a while, but they'll sort out who's next in line to take over eventually. We still… have business with them."</p><p>"You think they're still going to talk with you after you killed their boss?" Naruto asked disbelievingly.</p><p>"Eh, I always find a good assassination makes negotiating <em> much</em> easier," Zabuza said with a grin filled with very, very sharp teeth. Frankly, it was a little unnerving, which was probably the point. I wasn't entirely sure when or why he'd taken off the bandages.</p><p>"Yes well," Sensei said. "If that's the case…"</p><p>Zabuza shrugged. "Your bridge builder is safe," he said with rolled eyes. "We won't come up against you again. I'm done stuffing around with requests and bullshit. Shoulda done it my way to start off with."</p><p>Haku sighed. "We will not trouble you again," he assured us. "If there's anything I can do…"</p><p>For Naruto, that settled the matter. "Hey, hey, can you teach me some of those cool jutsu you used? Please?"</p><p>Haku blinked at him, flabbergasted. Zabuza laughed.</p><p>I figured that was as good an opening as I was going to get. "Umm… are you guys working with the Mist Rebellion?"</p><p>"What makes you ask that?" Zabuza asked warily. It occurred to me that most hidden villages tended to like the status quo staying as it was. A rebellion in one place might lead to others thinking it was a good idea.</p><p>I looked down. "Well, it was really the only reason that I could think of for someone of your rank being somewhere like this," I confessed. I didn't want to get into the whole explanation that I'd come up with. That would just be embarrassing.</p><p>Zabuza eyed us for a second longer then shrugged, apparently deciding he didn't care. "Yeah, we are. It isn't that much of a secret."</p><p>"Cool," I said, pleased to be validated. No one really knew that much about the Mist Rebellion, which was basically how they'd survived.</p><p>"Well, our mission lasts until the bridge is complete," Sensei said, half as an offer of peace, half as a warning.</p><p>Naruto saw something else in it. "Yeah! We're going to stay here too. So you can visit us, right Haku? Since you said you were staying."</p><p>"I… that might not be a good idea. We <em> did</em> attack you, after all," Haku said gently.</p><p>Naruto scoffed. "Who cares about that? You guys were lied to by that jerk Gatou. He's the real bad guy. We can all be friends now."</p><p>"Friends?" Haku smiled tentatively. "I'd like that." He glanced at the rest of us, to see how we'd taken Naruto's statement. Sasuke scowled, but I smiled back.</p><p>"Eh, don't worry about Sasuke," Naruto said, hands behind his head and face squinching into a mischievous grin. "He's just upset that you beat him."</p><p>Sasuke glared. "Idiot. You were the one that got <em> beaten</em> . I saved you."</p><p>"You're lucky Haku is so nice!" Naruto protested. "Otherwise -" He cut himself off; it was too soon to joke about it. "And anyway! You awakened your Sharingan thing, so it's not all bad, right?"</p><p>"Sharingan? You're an Uchiha. Huh. No wonder…" Zabuza murmured.</p><p>Naruto heard it anyway. He rounded on Zabuza with a loud, "Hey! Hey! What do you mean 'no wonder'? Don't go thinking that Sasuke is all that. You better remember <em> my</em> name. It's Naruto Uzumaki, future Hokage!"</p><p>"Easy, kids," Sensei said soothingly. "No need to start <em> another</em> fight now." Sensei was getting pretty good at diffusing situations like that. I had a feeling he was going to get a <em> lot</em> of practice.</p><p>"Future Hokage, you say?" Zabuza smirked. "I'll keep an eye on you. You might even make it into my bingo book."</p><p>Even as they left, Naruto almost <em> glowed.</em> Offhand it might have been, but you couldn't deny it was a compliment.</p><p>"That went… well," Kakashi-sensei said. He was a master of understatement.</p><p>I flopped down on the ground with an exhausted sigh, sitting next to Sasuke. "I guess you could say that."</p><p>"So, boys," Kakashi-sensei added, leaning against the railings. "Care to fill us in on what went on in your fight?"</p><p>I gave half my attention to their explanation and the other half to watching everyone's reactions. Sensei had retreated to his usual nonchalant slouch, but for someone with three quarters of his face completely covered he had a very expressive eye.</p><p>After Haku had iced the ground over, he'd kept out of their reach and simply pelted them with senbon, either real ones or water jutsu ones. They'd tried to get off the ice but he'd simply started cutting off their escape routes with walls of ice that had eventually turned into a kind of maze, separating them. He'd been able to merge with any of the ice, bouncing from one surface to the other faster than the eye could see. The boys had spent most of the time trying to regroup, and eventually managed, thanks to some quick thinking with Shadow Clones and a newly awakened Sharingan. Of course, once they'd begun to effectively retaliate, Haku had simply stepped up his game again, inflicting more and more serious hits on them. Naruto had been down and unable to stand when Haku had tried to get him with the temporary death technique - though they didn't know it at the time.</p><p>"<em> My body just moved on its own.</em> Che. What kind of excuse is that anyway?" Naruto muttered, looking down. Embarrassment, annoyance, gratitude and shame at having to be saved warred within him.</p><p>"Idiot. I don't know why I did it," Sasuke growled back. "I just did, okay?"</p><p>"Sasuke," I said quietly but seriously. "I know you don't like people touching you, but I'm going to hug you now." Fair warning given, I practically wrapped myself around him, tilting my chin down so they couldn't see my watery eyes. "You aren't allowed to die. You hear me? Rule Number One of Team 7: No dying."</p><p>It was stupid and idiotic and impossible.</p><p>"I like that rule," Kakashi-sensei said.</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Small and helpless and it was looming over me and it was like fire on my insides and hatredmaliceevilevilevil living and breathing and ohgod how can something like that exist?</em></p><p>I snapped awake with a shudder, stifling the scream that wanted to break free, the tears the sprung to my eyes. I was no stranger to nightmares, but Shika wasn't here and neither of my team mates would fill in for him. Well, Naruto might, but he was… it was… it was <em> right there</em> .</p><p>I stumbled to my feet, chakra light guiding my way as I fled from the room, from the house. The cold ocean breeze slapped across my face, stealing away remembered heat and leaving salt spray to mask my tears.</p><p>Tazuna's house had a veranda that edged out over the ocean, and there was a nook there, in the far wall, that was just big enough for a small child to squeeze into. I huddled into it, knees pulled to my chest, curled into a tight small ball. It wasn't a pose that lent itself to sudden movement - no balance, no explosive uncoiling - I wasn't defensive, I was hiding, plain and simple. The walls pressed in on me reassuringly, and my hands were thrust out front of me to push the darkness away. The water glimmered eerily in the reflected chakra light.</p><p>My chakra was curled within me, a tight ball of fear that eased with every breath that passed. I was safe. I was hidden. Nothing could get me. There was nothing out there at all.</p><p>Well, nothing except Kakashi-sensei. I frowned as I focused on his chakra signal. He was awake and moving, first to the where the boys were still asleep, then ghosting through the house in and out of each room. What was he doing? Was he looking for something?</p><p><em> Oh</em> , I realised sheepishly, boosting my chakra signal so it was back into normal range. I had pulled my chakra in so tightly that it couldn't be sensed, of course it had woken him. Dad had once mentioned that it worried him, but home was safe and I rarely felt the need to hide there. Here was <em> not</em> safe.</p><p>Sensei homed in on me, confirming my thoughts. I wiped my face on my sleeve and smiled weakly at him as he rounded the corner. To his credit, he didn't even look surprised at the odd position I'd wedged myself into.</p><p>"Mah, it's a bit early for you to be up, isn't it?" He asked cheerily, dropping to sit on the edge of the veranda, legs dangling over the side. That put him a good deal in front of me, but slightly to the side. Close but not too close.</p><p>It was a bit of an understatement. Judging by the stars and my internal body clock, it was probably around midnight. Late, rather than early.</p><p>I considered lying. Or deflecting. But the fact that he'd come looking for me, the amount of space he had given me, the set of his shoulders as he glanced at me out of the corner of his eye… it all spoke of worry. I didn't want to worry anyone.</p><p>"I had a nightmare," I admitted, voice scratchy and slightly wobbly. I coughed and swallowed and tried again. "It's nothing big."</p><p>He hummed non-judgementally. "Is that the first time you've seen someone killed?" He asked, voice soft and smooth and patient. "It can be upsetting."</p><p>I blinked. <em> Oh. </em> Truthfully, that had barely crossed my mind. And I was pretty sure I was responsible for at least a few of those deaths today, either by paralysing them or by kunai; it was hard to know. But Kakashi-sensei was trying to help. For all that he left us to our own devices, he did care. "It's not that," I said, hesitantly, wondering how to have this conversation. There was really no choice but to jump straight in. If I wanted to get information, this was the best time. Probably the only opportunity I was going to have. "That chakra… that Naruto had…" Sensei didn't stiffen, didn't react at all, but his eye flicked to me from where it had been scanning the horizon. "What was it?"</p><p>"I can't tell you that," Kakashi-sensei said after a long thoughtful pause. "That is… Naruto's secret."</p><p>"It's Kyuubi, isn't it?"</p><p>This time, he did turn to look at me. I fidgeted and drew back further into my hidey hole. "I …" I swallowed. "I remember that chakra. When I was really small." I couldn't seem to speak coherently, to explain. I could only hope he understood what I was trying to say. "I was really scared," I whispered. In the night silence it seemed too loud. I buried my face into my knees so I didn't have to look at him.</p><p>"You would only have been a few weeks old," Kakashi-sensei said, a note of shock buried in his voice. I wondered how he could have known - oh, our files. "Most people don't remember anything from that age."</p><p>Lucky them. "Bad things are always easier to remember than good things," I said, voice thick. "I remember… Shikamaru was crying, was screaming, but I couldn't. I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe, the air was so thick with it…" I trembled. That memory sprang to the surface too easily, the feelings of helpless terror flooding back even now. They didn't seem to weaken, not even after all this time.</p><p>Was it always going to be like this?</p><p>"It's alright. I remember too," Kakashi-sensei said, voice distant. He was seeing something that wasn't there. He'd probably been fighting that night, in the thick of it.</p><p>"That chakra was Kyuubi's," I said, when I'd stopped trembling again. "So how does Naruto have it?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei sighed. I could guess he was weighing up his options. It was a gamble asking him this. By rights he shouldn't say anything. But if he didn't then he would be allowing me to form my own conclusions as to <em> why</em> … And who knows what I would come up with? Since I'd already managed to nail the important points, I.e. that Kyuubi was present, there was probably a little leeway in explaining the details. If he left me to guessing chances were very slim that I'd come up with the right answer. And those wrong answers might cause problems.</p><p>"I'm going to get in trouble for this," he muttered, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>And he told me. Starting with the theory of sealing Jinchuriki before moving on to the specifics of Naruto's situation as opposed to the history taught at the Academy. That segued into a debate about the philosophy of just how much 'mind' a chakra construct could have and whether the concept of 'mind' was different from that of the 'mental energy' that composed chakra and how you would go about sealing an abstract concept like that from affecting the host anyway.</p><p>"I don't know," Sensei admitted. "Seals of that level are beyond my understanding. But the Fourth Hokage was a Seal <em> Master</em> . He would have created a seal that did nothing less. Naruto is not influenced by his prisoner." He seemed pretty desperate to get that point across.</p><p>I nodded, swinging my feet. Somewhere along the line of the conversation, I'd crept out of my hidey hole to sit beside Sensei and lean against him. "I believe you. Naruto's chakra is completely different from the Kyuubi's… it's just interesting, that's all…" I trailed off. I knew you could seal physical things, and I knew you could seal chakra, but I hadn't actually considered the metaphysics of how Naruto's Jinchuriki seal might actually work.</p><p>Now that my fear had faded a bit, it was <em> interesting</em> . How much of the mind was in the chakra and how much was in the brain? I had a tendency to think towards the physical, simply due to my previous existence, but Kyuubi had no physical body and it had intelligence enough to <em> talk</em> . In fact, where was the Kyuubi sealed <em> in</em> ? There was a mental connection between Naruto's mind and Kyuubi's prison, but he couldn't be physically <em> inside</em> Naruto. A pocket dimension maybe? Was the possible?</p><p>"Of course it is," Sensei sighed. Was he humouring me, or mocking me? I gave him a narrow eyed stare. He smiled cheerily and ruffled my hair. "Now, back to bed with you. It's late."</p><p>Almost on cue, I yawned.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We still had a week to go on our mission before the bridge was complete but with Gatou dead and Zabuza and Haku confirmed to be not a threat there wasn't really much for us to do.</p><p>We still went to the bridge or helped out in the village a bit. The villagers had taken a rather large shine to Naruto, after he had rounded them up with Inari and convinced them to come and help at the bridge. Already, the stories of his 'speech' were being incredibly exaggerated. He was sounding more and more like a hero of legend every day.</p><p>He'd given them hope, and that was irreplaceable.</p><p>Other than that, we spent most of our time at Tazuna's place. Sasuke was immobile and cranky about it, especially when Kakashi-sensei gave us a second lightning jutsu to practice (Lightning Release: Radiating Shockwave) and he wasn't able to wrangle his chakra enough to learn it.</p><p>I myself oscillated between being clingy to my team mates and scribbling down notes for all the things I wanted to look up when I got home. I'd brought a book with me, but I'd long since finished reading that.</p><p>"Did you want to play Shogi?" I asked Naruto. We'd had a few games since the bridge. Sasuke was a better player, but I'd been trouncing him all morning and he was fed up.</p><p>Naruto made a face. "I don't like Shogi," he whined. "The pieces make no sense!"</p><p>I sighed. Trying to teach Naruto tactics seemed to be like trying to hold water in your hands. Frustrating and ultimately pointless. Still, I was sure that if he could get basic strategy down, then his innate unpredictableness would be that much more deadly.</p><p>I had thought that presenting it as a game would help, but he seemed to lack the patience for it. Or didn't see the applications to real life. Then, I had an idea.</p><p>"Naruto. Make forty clones. We're going to play a game."</p><p>His face lit up. "A fun one? Really? That's so awesome!" He danced about a bit before making the required clones. Sasuke watched with detached interest.</p><p>"Right, you twenty, henge so you're wearing black. You, white." I divided them into half groups and lined them up in the shogi formation across the clearing. "You're Genin," I told the first line who stood in the place of pawns. "You can only move one step forward on any turn. You," I told the two in the next line, who were normally called Bishop and Rook, "are the ANBU captain and ANBU. I want you to henge into… okay, good. The Captain can only move diagonally, but you can go as many steps as you want. The ANBU can move forward, backwards and side to side as many steps as you want. " The next line was made of mixed types. "The two of you on the edge are Chunin. Henge a vest." They didn't just henge a vest, they turned into Iruka-sensei. I stifled a laugh. "You can move straight forward as many steps as you like. The next two in are Special Jounin. Henge a vest and a sword." The sword had no purpose, but to keep them from getting confused with the others. "You can move one step sideways and two steps forward. But! You can jump over any of the others in your way. You're the only ones that can do that," I added hastily. "You next two are Jounin." They turned into Kakashi-sensei, I rolled my eyes. They were the pieces normally called Silver Generals, so I suppose it fit. " You can move one step diagonally in any direction, and one step forward. The next two are the Elite Jounin. You can move one step sideways, backwards and forwards as well as one step forwards diagonally. And finally," I turned to the last Naruto in the middle of the file, "You are the Hokage."</p><p>He looked at me with round eyes. "Really?"</p><p>I laughed and nodded. "Yup. You're the Hokage. You can move one step in any direction." He performed henge with a flourish, turning himself into a black robed Hokage with a huge grin on his face.</p><p>"Right, Naruto," I turned to the original, who was watching with an odd look on his face. "Now you have an army, and I have an army. Lets play!"</p><p>"Finally! Attack!" The clones shuffled, apparently having a better idea of what was going on than the original.</p><p>"Err, boss?" Black Hokage Naruto spoke up. "You can only make one of us move at a time. And only, uh, how Shikako told us too."</p><p>Naruto frowned. "What? Why? That sucks!"</p><p>"Well, ninja are good at different things, right? So if you were ordering them around, you have to make sure you send the right people to do the right job. So you have to know what they can do. And you can only move one a turn, because it might take a while to get a message to ninja on the field," I invented quickly.</p><p>Naruto bought it. "Alright. Umm… what can you guys do again?" He walked down the lines listening to them repeat their moves. The clones had it easier, because they only had to remember one instruction not all of them.</p><p>It took a while to play, he had to repeatedly ask for moves, and sometimes the clones offered suggestions as what they could do. I didn't stop them. They were only thinking of their own moves, and what they could see of the battlefield, but Naruto had to consider the whole field. He'd work that out though, probably.</p><p>The first time I 'caught' a piece, he was outraged. "You can't do that!"</p><p>I laughed. "I, your evil enemy Shiro-Kage, have kidnapped one of your ninja!" I proclaimed. "I am going to brainwash him, so now he will fight for my side!" I nudged him, and he obediently turned his clothes white. I couldn't drop him back onto the field yet, but I would soon, just to prove I could. Shogi pieces weren't normally coloured, so that conversions like this could happen, but it made it easier to keep track of who belonged to who.</p><p>Naruto glowered. "You! Move forward!"</p><p>Of course, once I managed to get one of my pieces into the 'promotion zone' things got more difficult.</p><p>"Well done, Chunin! You've earned yourself a field medal! Now you can move one step sideways, backwards, forwards or forward diagonally! Just like an Elite Jounin!" I made him henge a tacky looking medal on, so we could tell him apart from the others.</p><p>Naruto glowered again. "That's not cool"</p><p>"You have to reward hard work! He made it all the way inside your Hidden Village, you know," I commented.</p><p>Afterwards, we dispelled all the clones. I wonder what it felt like for Naruto to be the general of the game as well as every soldier on both the winning and losing sides. He blinked dizzily for a moment.</p><p>Hmm, maybe the contradictory memories were causing problems…</p><p>"Let's play again!" he said, determined.</p><p>His next game was better by leaps and bounds. That was Shadow Clone learning at work. He still wasn't very <em> good</em> but it was noticeably better. A few weeks of this and he might end up being a half decent player.</p><p>We ran into Haku and Zabuza a few times, too, despite their intentions. Gatou had apparently liked to horde his power, so there was no clear cut inheritor. That just meant that his underlings were fighting it out, mostly via blackmail and politics rather than actual fighting. That left them in a state of limbo, unable to go anywhere.</p><p>Zabuza grumbled but Haku had bonded with Naruto and didn't seem to mind overly much. I got the feeling it made Sensei wary, but he didn't say anything against it. Naruto even managed to get him to teach us the Hidden in the Mist Jutsu amidst Zabuza's protests of village secrets.</p><p>Now that was a Jutsu that interested me. Okay, it was as annoying as <em> hell</em> from the opposite side but incredibly useful for an attacker. I could manage a light mist in a small area about the size of a bedroom but Naruto could practically smother people with his. If there was a way for Sasuke and Naruto to learn to navigate in it…</p><p>It was something to consider.</p><p>By the time Sasuke was back on his feet… I was a <em> little</em> bored.</p><p>A dangerous state of affairs.</p><p>I crept through the branches, suspended above the ground, a predator hunting it's prey. I was the hunting jungle cat, I was the wolf on the prowl. I felt like smirking as I observed Sasuke's turned back. He didn't even know I was here.</p><p><em> Hehehe…</em></p><p>I was a younger sister, too. More importantly, I was a younger sister whose brother sometimes needed to be… motivated to play.</p><p>Cat's Foot technique ensured that my steps made no sound. I slunk across the branch, redistributing my weight so it didn't as much as shudder. No leaves rustled with my passing. Nothing gave me away.</p><p>I pounced.</p><p>There was a surprisingly girlish shriek that didn't come from me as I barrelled squarely into his back, sending us both crashing to the ground. I jumped over his retaliatory leg grab, spinning and running. He was up and chasing me before he registered <em> why</em> .</p><p>I was fleet of foot, like the deer the clan raised. Sasuke's initial reaction was anger, which faded to puzzlement. But he didn't stop chasing.</p><p>"Nyeh!" I teased, darting around trees, always, always staying just that little bit ahead of him. He was fast, but so was I.</p><p>My heart pounded. I felt like giggling.</p><p>Sasuke grabbed for me. I dodged, darting around him for freedom. He looked like he had no idea what he was doing, but he was playing anyway. Even if he didn't know he was playing.</p><p>"Catch me if you can!" I taunted lightly, giggling as I went. We wove through the trees, in and out of the forest, circling around the house. Sensei looked bemused as he watched us darting across the lawn.</p><p>"Hi Haku, hi Zabuza!" I chirped, seeing them standing next to Kakashi-sensei. "Nice to see you!"</p><p>Sasuke growled, as I escaped him again, trying to sound annoyed, instead sounding like a giant playful dog. I laughed, delighted. He lunged. I barely slipped from his grip, darting to what every child knew was the 'safe zone'. "Nyeh!" I stuck my tongue at him from behind Sensei.</p><p>Sasuke's face was a picture of disbelief.</p><p>"Now, now kids…" Sensei said.</p><p>Sasuke grabbed for me. I circled keeping Kakashi-sensei between us. He feinted right, then lunged left. I scrambled backwards, abandoning the Kakashi-sensei to duck behind Zabuza.</p><p>"This wont end well," Sensei muttered under his breath.</p><p>Sasuke's eyes narrowed.</p><p><em> Fast!</em> I giggled, zipping away up onto the veranda around the house, using chakra to slide quickly over the smooth wood.</p><p>"Hey guys! What are you -"</p><p>I could have dodged. Really. But where would be the fun in that? I crashed into Naruto full force, sending him flying into the water as Sasuke rounded the corner, tripped over me and landed beside him.</p><p>They hauled themselves, dripping, from the water as I laughed helplessly.</p><p>They exchanged a look. "Get her."</p><p>I shrieked.</p><p>"What is your brat pack doing around there?" Zabuza's voice drifted to us. "Trying to kill each other?"</p><p>Given that I was trying to force Naruto's head underwater while Sasuke was sending crashing waves over both of us, it might not have been that wild a guess.</p><p>"I don't even know," Sensei sighed, as they rounded on the water. He stared at the three of us, laughing and exhilarated and wet from head to toe. "I'm not sure I want to."</p><p>We exchanged a single look, the idea zipping between us instantly. It was like we were of one mind.</p><p>A sheet of water went <em> flying</em> for the bank.</p><p>"You'll have to do better than that," Kakashi-sensei said, a second before my chakra powered water hose caught him in the face.</p><p>"Oh, you think that's funny, do you?" Sensei growled. Just like that his book was gone and there was a <em> glint</em> in his eye. His hand blurred and then there were three miniature dragons rising from the water and <em> chasing</em> us.</p><p>It was brilliant.</p><p>Possibly the most epic water fight ever.</p><p>In between jumping on Kakashi-sensei and being dragged upside down through the air in the mouth of a water dragon, I caught sight of the pair on the bank.</p><p>Zabuza was shaking his head, possibly at the foolishness of Konoha ninja and <em> how had he lost to that?</em></p><p>Haku looked amused but also a little sad. I quirked my eyebrow at him in a way that said <em> come to the dark side, we have cookies</em> .</p><p>He considered.</p><p>Then there was a yelp and a splash and Haku was the only one standing on the bank.</p><p>I screamed with laughter and was summarily dunked head first into the water.</p><p>An hour later we were drying in the bright sunshine, exhausted and panting. Haku was staying out of easy reach of Zabuza, but kept shaking with giggles.</p><p>"Right," Sensei said, cracking his one eye half open to glare at us. "What I was going to say before was that the bridge is going to be open tomorrow. We'll head back to Konoha after that."</p><p>"I see," Haku said. "This will probably be the last time we will see you then." He looked wistful. "I wish you well."</p><p>"No way!" Naruto exclaimed. "We're totally going to see each other again. You can count on it! So, you don't have to look so sad."</p><p>Even Sasuke had warmed up to Haku after their initial bad start. He was warm and friendly and calm and polite and hadn't <em> really</em> hurt anyone, after all. He was hard to <em> dislike</em> . Haku's talk about protecting precious people and living for your dreams had made Sasuke oddly pensive and considering for a while, especially when Haku had told him that his sacrifice had earnt his respect. I hoped it was a good thing. "Who knows what will happen in the future?" He shrugged. "Regardless, I've learnt a lot here."</p><p>Haku smiled. "I as well."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning dawned clear and fine. We packed our things up, chasing down loose odds and ends and double checking to make sure we hadn't left anything behind.</p><p>We disarmed all the traps we had set around the house and made sure we hadn't left any stray shuriken on the lawn just so that no one got hurt.</p><p>Then we went to the opening of the bridge.</p><p>It wasn't a big ceremony. There was only a thin red ribbon tied between two posts and a placard to be lifted into place, but the whole island was there. Dozens of people packed in to listen to Tazuna's speech.</p><p>"In this land," Tazuna began. The crowd hushed instantly. "We've had a lot of hardship. We've had a lot of struggle. Gatou pushed us down for a long time. But we fought back. We built this bridge to freedom. We built this bridge out of hope. We built this bridge out of courage and determination and with own two hands!"</p><p>There was a cheer.</p><p>"The old man is good speaker," Naruto whispered, surprised.</p><p>"But it wouldn't have been enough. Not on our own. It was the ninja from the Village Hidden in the Leaves that came and changed our hearts. They were the ones who gave us the courage to fight back. They inspired us. They fought with us, beside us and for us… despite having no reason to do so. That is why the perfect name for this bridge is… THE GREAT NARUTO BRIDGE!"</p><p>The cheer, this time, was so much louder. Two men lifted the placard into place alongside the bridge. There, emblazoned in the bronze in huge ornate letters, was the name of the bridge.</p><p>Beside me, Naruto was frozen.</p><p>"I like it," I said. Maybe it overshadowed us, but Naruto was the one the villagers saw, who had inspired them to fight, who had given them courage, who had made them band together and take back what Gatou had stolen. Having the will to fight for something woken like that… meant they were less likely to have it taken from them again.</p><p>That was important too.</p><p>Tazuna cut the ribbon on the posts, the two severed ends fluttering lightly to the ground. He beckoned us up to stand beside himself and Inari.</p><p>"Please, walk with us to be the first people to use our new bridge."</p><p>It was almost like a parade, everyone walking down the bridge with us at the head. Bemusing and strange, but almost right.</p><p><em> This is what it was for.</em> All the fighting, the training, the fear, it had been for these people, so they could have this bridge. Nothing had changed yet, there was no trade in, no relaxing of tariffs… but the people were lighter and happier already. They had <em> hope</em> .</p><p>By the time we reached the soil of the Land of Fire, Naruto had snapped out of his shock and started to sniffle. Just a little bit.</p><p>"Hah," Inari said, wiping his own watery eyes. "Don't be such a crybaby."</p><p>"Idiot," Naruto retorted. "It's okay to cry if you're happy!"</p><p><hr /></p><p>AN: So is everyone okay with the scene breaks? I know all the other chapters were done in one long continuous stretch, but I thought this worked better here.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Waves Arc: Chapter 15</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: More Team Seven bonding and random administrative stuffs. I <em> like</em> imagining this kind of thing.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 15</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> No one realizes how beautiful it is to travel until he comes home and rests his head on his old, familiar pillow. – Lin Yutang</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The trip back to Konoha took three days at ninja speed, compared to the week it had taken us to get there with Tazuna. That still put our total mission time at just under a month, though.</p><p>We'd been gone for a long time and we were all eager to get home.</p><p>So it was with excitement that we clocked in with the gate guards and headed to the Missions Assignment Desk to report 'Mission Accomplished'. For our D-ranks, closing the mission had been a simple affair. We'd shown up, reported our task accomplished and been paid.</p><p>It wasn't quite so easy this time. The client's information had been falsified, we'd been attacked by enemy ninja - upping the rank from C to B then to A - and independently decided to proceed with the upgraded mission. There needed to be a debriefing.</p><p>The Hokage's pipe puffed contemplatively as Kakashi-sensei reported that there had been complications.</p><p>"I'll take this, Iwashi," he said calmly standing from behind the desk and escorting us out of the main room. There were separate debriefing rooms not far away, to keep from holding up the process in the Assignment room. It was a bit of a surprise that the Hokage himself wanted to debrief us, but he did take a heavy interest in the new Genin teams and Naruto in particular.</p><p>Instead of letting us try to muddle our way through explanations like he normally did, Kakashi-sensei took over, explaining concisely and exactly what had happened over the mission. Actually, hearing the summary of how things had gone, it didn't really sound that bad. We'd actually managed to tie things up very neatly what with Gatou being killed, Wave Country respecting us and the friendly semi-alliance we'd built with Haku and Zabuza.</p><p>If you ignored Sensei's chakra exhaustion and Sasuke nearly dying, we hadn't even come out of it with injuries.</p><p>Now that was impressive.</p><p>"I see," the Hokage said, picking up a brush to make on note on some paper. "I will have a representative sent to the Land of Waves to renegotiate mission fees. I'm sure with this outcome, they will be more than willing to pay." Given that there were negotiators on staff with tongues so silver they could convince you to give up a first born, that really wouldn't be a problem. It was actually fairly common for mission contracts to be rewritten in the field so to speak, as new information or circumstances came to light. Konoha negotiators were also fairly lenient when it came to payment, it didn't have to be upfront in cash - trade increases, payments over time, concessions in this or that, these things benefited us too and they had the added bonuses of not making us seem greedy.</p><p>"Given the inclusion of a missing-nin such as Zabuza Momochi, your mission has been upgraded post-completion to that of A-rank. You will be paid as such. Congratulations on your first successful A-rank mission." He smiled.</p><p>Naruto cheered. "Take that! I bet none of the other teams have done an A-rank yet!"</p><p>The Hokage chucked. "Indeed not. It's quite an achievement. But before you go, there is some paper work that needs to be filed to validate your mission upgrade. I'll have it sent in to you."</p><p>Sensei groaned.</p><p>"Aww, man," Naruto complained. "I wanted to go tell Iruka-sensei! Maybe he'd buy me some ramen."</p><p>"Administrative duties are also part of being a ninja," the Hokage explained on his way out of the room. "A distasteful, unpleasant part, but important all the same."</p><p>"Can't get paid without the paperwork," I translated, with a smile. "Maybe you can buy your own ramen then."</p><p>Naruto pouted.</p><p>There wasn't really all that much paperwork to do, anyway. A Chunin brought the file - and some pens - into the briefing room and left us to fill it out. It was pretty simple, in the end. Name, ninja ID, team, number of members, assigned mission, assigned mission rank, rank upgrade to…, because of…, authorised by…, approved by…</p><p>The last one we left blank for the Hokage to sign and we trooped back out to the Mission Assignment desk. The Hokage flicked through the papers, signed them then handed them off to the payment desk.</p><p>Naruto eagerly got his payment in cash, but I requested a transferral slip.</p><p>"What's that?" Naruto asked, puzzled. "Aren't you getting your money?"</p><p>I blinked at him. "It's a type of payment slip. There isn't really any point in me cashing in here, since I have to transfer it through the clan anyway and pay dues. Clan tax," I clarified. "If I use payment slips, then they know the exact amount I was paid, where if I got cash they might say I lied about it."</p><p>"Clan tax?" Naruto repeated. "They take your money?"</p><p>"Well, sort of, I guess," I said. Even though our clan had a fair bit of income from our medicinal produce, it still needed support from active duty members. "We give them a percentage of the money we earn on missions and in return the clan looks after us. Housing, equipment, medical treatment, research grants… that kind of stuff." It wasn't a bad system. Certainly it was better than what some other clans did, or what lengths non-clan ninja had to go to for financial security.</p><p>"How much is it?" Sasuke asked, intrigued, as we walked outside. That was kind of a rude question, but I didn't get offended. Sasuke was probably too young at the time to know what kind of system his own clan had had.</p><p>"Mmm, I'm not sure. Probably around 40% for me, I think. It depends on a lot of factors like your rank and the mission rank and… well stuff like that." Like if you were single or married or had dependents or … well there were thousands of qualifiers. Everyone in the clan had their own tax rate which got recalculated every few months baring significant events. Like loss of limbs.</p><p>We stepped out of the Tower into the sunshine. I breathed in deeply, glad to be home. I couldn't wait to get back to the clan grounds, to see Mum and Dad and Shika. It'd be nice to see them all again after so long.</p><p>I glanced at my team mates and felt a twinge of guilt. None of them really had anyone to go home too. Empty rooms and empty cupboards were all that awaited them.</p><p>I was lucky.</p><p>"Did you guys want to come to my place for dinner?" I offered awkwardly, impulsively. "To celebrate our first successful mission and all…"</p><p>Naruto looked uncharacteristically nervous. "Wouldn't your parents mind?"</p><p>I shook my head. Dad wouldn't and I could talk mum around if she did. We had a pretty lax policy about guests at home anyway. Ino and Sakura often came home with me, and Chouji and Shika were inseparable. "Nah, they'll be cool with it." I cast my gaze from Naruto to Sasuke to Sensei. "Only if you guys want to. You don't have to…"</p><p>"We'd love to!" Naruto said hastily, accepting for all of them. "I bet your mum and dad are awesome."</p><p>I nodded. "They are!" I assured them. "It'll be great."</p><p>"Well, mission accomplished, team." Kakashi-sensei smiled. "You've got tomorrow off, so make the most of it. We'll start training again after that."</p><p>"Yes, sensei," we chorused, looking forward to doing just that. It had been a long mission, even if there had been no excitement after Zabuza left.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei fell into step beside me. "I'll walk you home," he offered. "I need to have a word with your father."</p><p>I nodded. "Of course, sensei." Call it paranoia or hubris, but that 'word' was probably going to be about me.</p><p>"Tadaima!" I called as I entered the foyer and shucked off my shoes. <em> I'm home!</em></p><p>"Okaeri," Mum responded, coming out of the kitchen. She looked incredibly happy to see me.</p><p>"Sensei needs to talk to dad," I explained. "Is he home?"</p><p>"Out playing shogi with your brother." She rolled her eyes. "Can I get you some tea, Hakate-sensei?"</p><p>I left Sensei to mum's mercies and padded over to open the sliding door leading to the veranda. "Hi," I said softly, taking in the game. Shikamaru was losing, of course.</p><p>Dad stood, glancing over my shoulder. "Welcome back. I'll go see what your sensei needs. Why don't you stay here and keep Shikamaru company?"</p><p>I wondered if Sensei had signalled him for a private conversation. It didn't really matter. "Sure," I said, plopping down beside Shika and leaning into him, trying to plot possible tactics on the game. Shika was a better Shogi player than me, so he'd probably already noticed them all.</p><p>Dad slid the shoji door shut behind him. Of course, that wasn't exactly going to stop me listening in. I channelled chakra to my ears to enhance my hearing. It was a trick I was only just starting to manage with any reliability. Hearing was easier than sight and more useful than smell. To me anyway, I doubt the Inuzuka would agree, but my sense of smell has always been rather poor naturally.</p><p>"What about a rising silver?" I asked, point to one of Shika's pieces on the board and naming a common tactic. If I could hear them, they could hear us. Best they heard something mundane.</p><p>He snorted. "Are you kidding? And walk into that trap there?" He motioned at some of dads pieces.</p><p>"Hmm, I see. But if you did it in combination with-" Only half my concentration was on the game, which was why I wasn't coming up with anything brilliant.</p><p>"<em> - nightmares often?"</em> Kakashi-sensei was saying.</p><p>Shikamaru rolled his eyes and took over our conversation because he knew exactly how nosey I was.</p><p>"<em> Fairly frequently. Is it interfering with her missions?"</em> Mum sounded… anxious? Worried, maybe.</p><p>"<em> Not exactly.</em> " He paused. There was a creaking sound. Sensei leaning back in his chair? <em> "There was an incident on this mission. Naruto used… his special chakra. It affected her badly."</em></p><p>I winced. I'd frozen up in the middle of a fight, been completely useless, and had nightmares. Badly was an understatement.</p><p>There was a weighty silence inside. "But your knight…" I said to Shika offhandedly.</p><p>"No. See here…"</p><p>"<em> I see," </em> Dad said. <em> "Shikako is extremely sensitive to chakra. She feels it very strongly. It was unexpected that she learnt to use it at all. Given the nature of … that chakra, it isn't surprising that she was affected."</em></p><p>"<em> Even that day, she was strongly affected by it,"</em> Mum added, sounding distant. I could picture her worried face, see her clenching and unclenching her fists. <em> "We were very worried. A lot of people… never recovered, particularly young kids. They just gave up and died. We thought… we thought she might be one of them. She was very loud before then but afterwards… she didn't make a sound."</em></p><p>"<em> She said she remembered that day,"</em> Sensei said carefully. <em> "And she recognised that chakra for what it was. Named it, even."</em></p><p>"<em> She knows?"</em></p><p>Sensei made an affirmative sound. <em> "She guessed. I felt it better to clarify than allow her to make any further conclusions on her own."</em></p><p>"<em> She always has been very clever,"</em> Mum said, but she sounded shocked.</p><p>"<em> And will that affect her team placement?"</em> Dad asked.</p><p>"<em> Not unless you have objections. She hasn't shown any indication to being affected by the information but you may want to talk with her. Particularly to emphasise the secrecy around the issue."</em></p><p>I sighed, resting my head on Shikamaru's shoulder. Right. S-class secret. Can't tell anyone. Though Shikamaru could probably work it out pretty easily, given the right clues. Not that I'd do that, either, but it wouldn't stay secret forever.</p><p>"<em> Thank you for alerting us,"</em> Mum said and their conversation degraded into pleasant goodbyes. I cut the chakra to my ears when I heard the main door open and shut. Just in time too, as Dad opened the sliding shoji door. There wasn't any physical give away for enhanced senses, but I still suspected that Dad would be able to tell. Maybe because he was a ninja, maybe because he was a parent. Either way, I'd probably be in trouble.</p><p>"Teaming up on me?" He asked, amused.</p><p>"Nah," I said, standing with a stretch. "I invited my team around for dinner, so I better go and tell mum. Besides, the game's nearly over."</p><p>"Traitor," Shikamaru muttered.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"So how did your mission go?" Mum asked as we puttered around in the kitchen.</p><p>I froze, casting a glance through the door. Shika and Dad had migrated into the living room after the end of their Shogi match and, yup, they were listening too.</p><p>My first reaction was to lie. Lie like the world was ending. I squashed that thought. Not only were my parents ninja and would probably notice, Dad was Jounin Commander and could look up mission reports, and I had invited my team mates around for dinner. It would not stay secret with Naruto here.</p><p>In fact, them putting together what had happened by offhand comments would make them react worse than if I straight out told them.</p><p>And they'd be disappointed.</p><p>Very disappointed.</p><p>So that was out.</p><p>I couldn't claim that I couldn't tell them. Yes, it was A-ranked, but secrecy hadn't been one of the requirements. Telling them that would actually be much worse, because things were only classified if they were <em> highly</em> sensitive and Genin had no business being on those missions.</p><p>That didn't mean I wasn't going to tell the truth <em> carefully.</em> If I managed to say it right, it would sound much less dangerous than if I didn't watch my words. Of course, Sensei had already given the game away a little bit. I'd need to be a professional spin doctor to get myself out of this.</p><p>"Well, our C-rank mission was to escort a guy to the Land of Waves," I began before the silence could draw out and make them too suspicious. "He was a bridge builder and…"</p><p>I wove the tale carefully, mentioning the ambush but leaving out that Sensei had left us to fight it. I told them Tazuna had been targeted by the local crime boss, but left out that that boss was <em> Gatou</em> . It was a famous name. I had to mention Zabuza by name, since there was really no way around it.</p><p>"Zabuza Momochi!" Mum yelped. "He's an A-rank missing nin! What was he doing there? You couldn't possibly have fought him! That's not <em> C-rank!</em> "</p><p>"Sensei fought him," I said soothingly, not mentioning the water clone. At all. "He used his Sharingan. Sasuke was really surprised that he had one, but it was pretty awesome. I think he hypnotised Zabuza with it or something, because he really freaked him out. They both used these <em> huge</em> water dragons… it was really impressive." I carried on a bit about the fight I'd only partially seen. Hey, Sensei had been awesome, and Mum was buying the 'if Kakashi-sensei was fighting, we weren't' implication.</p><p>There was a heavy stare on my back. I glanced out into the living room to meet Dad's eyes. Okay, Mum might have been buying it, but I don't think Dad was.</p><p>"Sensei almost got him, but then Zabuza was rescued by his partner, who was pretending to be a Hunter-nin. Since we were more concerned about protecting Tazuna than chasing him down, he got away." <em> because Sensei was out of it</em> , I did not add. No way was I stating, saying, or even implying that we had been left pretty much defenceless against an unknown opponent. I could <em> see</em> the explosion that would cause.</p><p>I chattered on about the bridge, and the people we'd met and how Kakashi-sensei had taught us a few jutsu, trying to draw a picture that said 'it wasn't dangerous at all, honest'. I had a whole two weeks of material to draw on, and Tsunami had shown me how to make a few traditional Wave Country dishes when I'd offered to help her with the cooking.</p><p>Mum was relaxing, just a bit. "Oh? Snapper Yakizakana? That sounds nice."</p><p>"Oh, it was. Tsunami was a very good cook." Particularly with the minimal ingredients that she had to work with at the time. "She let me copy most of her recipe book too."</p><p>The last bit was the really <em> delicate</em> bit to tell.</p><p>"Zabuza and Haku, that was the fake Hunter-nin guys name, tried to attack Tazuna again once more. Kakashi-sensei fought Zabuza again, and Naruto and Sasuke took on Haku. I didn't really see what happened, but Sasuke got knocked out and we thought he was dead. That made Naruto <em> really</em> angry."</p><p>Mum and Dad could read in between the lines there.</p><p>"We won the fight and were about to tie them up," or whatever Kakashi-sensei had intended to do. I didn't really know. "when the crime boss showed up. He must have thought they were dead or injured or something, because he started insulting them and said he wouldn't pay them."</p><p>There was a snort from behind me. My lips quirked into a smirk. "Yeah, they weren't too happy about that either. They said that they didn't have a reason to fight us anymore, so we let them go. Then they killed him." I shrugged. "That pretty much solved all our problems."</p><p>"Neat," Shikamaru said. I think it appealed to him, having all your problems solved without having to do anything.</p><p>"Just like that?" Mum asked.</p><p>I nodded. "Pretty much. We had to stick around for another week till the bridge was finished, but there was no other attacks. The villagers thought we were heroes; they even named their bridge after Naruto."</p><p>"After… Naruto?" Mum blinked. Okay, without the full story, that probably came a little out of left field.</p><p>"He makes an impression on people, you know? The villagers all liked him."</p><p>They didn't know. They'd never <em> really </em> met him. Sure, Shika and I had hung out with him at the Academy, but we hadn't been awfully close and he'd only come around once or twice. That wasn't a lot for them to base judgement on.</p><p>Story time over and with no explosions I let myself relax, just a bit.</p><p>"A little extreme for your first C-rank," Dad commented idly.</p><p>I shrugged. "Luck of the draw, I guess. At least we had Kakashi-sensei." It wasn't like there was anything I could have done about <em> that.</em></p><p>"Too much excitement for me." Shikamaru shuddered.</p><p>I smirked again. "Ino make you take a C-rank?" I asked. If they'd got a shorter one, they could have accomplished it in the time we were gone.</p><p>"Yes," he groaned. "It was troublesome. We were delivering messages to all these outposts… so much running…"</p><p>I laughed, feeling lighter than I had since we'd taken the Wave Mission.</p><p>It was good to be home.</p><p>It was around six o'clock when the doorbell rang, the first of my team mates to show up.</p><p>"I'll get it," Mum said, drying her hands off, as I was elbow deep in peeling vegetables for dinner.</p><p>"It's Naruto," I said. After spending so long with them, their chakra signatures were so familiar to me I could pick them out of a crowd. Telling who was on the other side of the closed door was easy.</p><p>To her credit, Mum only hesitated for a second. "Good evening. Welcome to our home," she said, politely as she opened the door. I leant sideways, just a little, so I could see what was going on.</p><p>"Um, I got told it was polite to bring a gift, so … here! Uh, thank you for inviting me, Nara-san." Well, that was uncharacteristically polite of him. If he'd found Iruka-sensei like he said he was going to, he'd probably been given a lecture on politeness.</p><p>Mum blinked at the potted plan that was thrust at her and Naruto's nervous expression. I could see what she saw in that instant, scruffy and unkempt but with a good heart underneath. Without really trying, he had won her over.</p><p>"That wasn't really necessary, but thank you anyway, Naruto. Please call me Yoshino, there are too many Nara's here for formalities." She gently took the plant from him. We weren't exactly gardeners, but it looked well cared for. "Please, come in. Shikako is in the kitchen at the moment."</p><p>"Hey, Naruto," I said, waving through the doorway. "Shika is in the living room. You can go bother him for a while, if you like."</p><p>"Ah… do you need any help?" he asked.</p><p>"No, we're fine," I smiled. "Don't worry, I'll be done soon. Just have to start everything cooking and all."</p><p>Sasuke arrived shortly after and Mum shooed me out of the kitchen to go talk to them. I tried to keep the conversation light, asking about what they were going to do with their day off and such, but Shika ruined it for me, lazily asking Naruto what our mission had been like.</p><p>When Naruto launched into a spirited retelling, aided by comments from Sasuke, of all the fights I'd left out of my own tale… well.</p><p>I sighed. <em> Should have figured this would happen,</em> I thought, ignoring the fact that I had anticipated it. Regardless, despite Dad's raised eyebrow and Mum's disbelieving reactions, it didn't actually go down that badly. The fact that it didn't <em> contradict</em> anything I'd told them probably helped.</p><p>Naruto seemed gratified that they were listening to him, and Sasuke shot down most of his embellishments, so if you ignored the 'Genin facing off against A-rank nin' aspect, it didn't sound too horrifying. We went, we fought, we won. Simple. Expected.</p><p><em> Yeah, maybe not,</em> I thought, eyeing Mum. She was going to have <em> words</em> at me later.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei hadn't shown up by the time the food was ready, and it didn't look like he was going to anytime soon, so we started eating without him. It was a fun dinner, with plenty of lively conversation. It wasn't that we never talked at the table, it was just we tended to have pointed short conversations about something in particular.</p><p>Naruto just talked.</p><p>And before you knew it, everyone else was talking too. It was a kind of charisma, I guess, one that didn't rely so much on being <em> nice</em> but on being <em> real</em> .</p><p>Dinner was over and I was clearing plates off the table when I felt something that made me grin. It drew out for a long moment and my grin faltered.</p><p>I stared at the door. Kakashi-sensei's chakra hovered on the other side of it. Was he going to knock or just stand there? Maybe he thought coming was a bad idea and was just going to turn around and leave. Should I open the door anyway?</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>"I'll get it!"</p><p>I slammed the door open and chirped, "Hi, sensei!"</p><p>He blinked, hands deep in his pockets. Even though he was in his usual lazy slouch, I thought I could read his awkwardness. "Sorry, I'm late. I had to rearrange my garden gnomes, Timothy and Sir Bedevere aren't getting along so I had to separate them."</p><p>I blinked and then giggled at the image of Kakashi-sensei having a set of garden gnomes that he'd given names and personalities. They would probably have little headbands and Henohenomoheji capes like his summons.</p><p>"It's okay, sensei," I said, leading him into the house. "We just finished eating, but I can heat you up some leftovers."</p><p>"Ahh, that's not really necessary," he said, shrugging uncomfortably.</p><p>"Sure it is," I grinned. "There's lots of leftovers and I helped cook it specially. You can't turn that down."</p><p>"Guess I can't," he said, eye crinkling with a smile.</p><p>I piled a plate high and zapped it in the microwave. "You can bring it out to the living room or eat in here or whatever. Just leave the plate on the counter when you're done," I offered, not sure if Kakashi-sensei really was as pedantic about his mask as everyone made out.</p><p>"Ah, thanks." He scratched his cheek through his mask. "I'll eat in here."</p><p>"Okay." I left him there and went back into the living room</p><p>"Ne, ne, Shikako, come play with us!" Naruto said excitedly. I blinked to see him sitting next to Sasuke and across a Shogi board from Shikamaru. "We'll play Team Seven verses Shikamaru!"</p><p>I grinned. "Sounds awesome," I said, sinking down between the boys. It was a little crowded but not all that bad. "Prepare to be beaten."</p><p>Shikamaru scoffed. "Troublesome girl."</p><p>Sometime through the game, Sensei came into the living room and settled onto the sofa behind us at our urging.</p><p>"I'll get Dad to help me," Shika threatened.</p><p>"What's the matter? Feeling scared?" I taunted.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I could see mum standing with the family camera. Technology was a little strange in this world. It was only the elite that had access to a high level of technology. Something handheld like Mum was using took extreme connections to get, even if I considered bulky and consistent with like the nineteen seventies. Heck, the camera that administration used for ID photos looked like it was from the eighteen hundreds.</p><p>If I thought about it, it was probably more societal than due to any lack of skill. They had fireworks so they clearly had gunpowder. They had radio, they had cameras and TVs. There was at least some people capable of building cameras.</p><p>But instead of saying 'how can this help the public' or even 'how can we sell this' like my world, they hid it. Not just the plans and blueprints, but everything. No one shared anything. Added to the fact that these were things that ninja wouldn't like - concealable cameras, radio and video that can be sent across the entire <em> nation</em> ? No, they wouldn't like that at all. And things that ninja didn't like had a tendency to disappear. Not only that, but everyone that had heard of them mysteriously vanished or forgot they'd ever heard of it. Ninja might be able to adapt, but they'd prefer to shut it down before it got to that stage. The status quo was reasonably good to them.</p><p>And yeah, I'm a little glad, because I never want to think the words 'ninja' and 'atomic bomb' in the same sentence ever again.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei made his escape after the shogi game, leaving the three of us with ruffled hair.</p><p>"Come late and leave early," Naruto muttered. "That's sensei."</p><p>I shrugged. "I'm glad he come at all. I didn't think he was going to." I was actually really delighted that he had, to be truthful.</p><p>We kept talking until Naruto yawned, loudly. "Oops," he muttered, casting a wide eyed glance at Mum and Dad. He didn't seem to know how to act around them.</p><p>"It's okay." I smiled. "It is getting pretty late. I think Shika is sleeping with his eyes open."</p><p>"Hey," said brother objected, proving me wrong.</p><p>Naruto snickered and said his goodbyes, Sasuke following him. I sighed and leant backwards, contemplating going to bed until I noticed that Mum's eyes were trained seriously on me.</p><p><em> Crap.</em></p><p>I looked for Shika for support, only to find him halfway up the stairs. He'd already made his escape.</p><p><em> Double crap.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I sat at the kitchen table, sipping green tea and writing up my mission report.</p><p>Mission reports were a bitch to write. The level of detail you had to include was pretty extreme. The thing was, all mission reports got passed through the Intelligence Division and stashed in the Archive and those little details might play an important role in some <em> other</em> mission. We were all the little pieces that contributed to the big picture they looked at.</p><p>…<em> encountered two missing nin; identified as Momochi, Zabuza and 'Unknown', Haku. Momochi Zabuza: Skin tone, shade two; facial structure, type three, partial coverage from bandages - nose to chin -; eye shape, type five; eye colour, brown; eyebrows, light to none. Outfit consisting of: headband, Mist standard, plate at left temple; pants, grey; leg warmers, black and white camouflage; forearm bands, black and white camouflage…</em></p><p>I yawned. For those of us without drawing skill (that is, most of us) we identified people by a series of standardised facial features. It was rather like an Identikit that the police used to create suspect pictures.</p><p>We'd learnt memorisation techniques in the Academy in order to remember this level of detail. At the time they'd been rather fun, involving cut out cards of various facial parts and contests to see who could make the right face. Actually, a large proportion of time at the Academy had focused on memorisation techniques.</p><p>"Oh, there you are," Mum said in relief as she bustled into the dining room. "I thought you might have already left."</p><p>"Mission report," I explained. "We've got the day off anyway. Did you need something?"</p><p>"Well, I just had the thought that if you were going to be going on missions like <em> that</em> , and honestly," she frowned. I hoped she wasn't going to start ranting again. "What were they thinking? I told your father that he ought to step up your training, for both of you, but he just mumbled at me!" She huffed. "Said you wouldn't be ready for the next step until you were Chunin anyway."</p><p>I made a noncommittal sound. For all Dad had a lackadaisical approach to training, if he said we weren't ready we probably weren't ready.</p><p>"But well, I do have a few skills of my own," she continued. I perked up. Sure, there was more to being a ninja than cool jutsu, but they sure helped. "If you have a few hours to spare to train with your Mum."</p><p>"Of course I do," I assured her. More training was <em> always</em> worth it. Supervised training was even better. "Actually, I've been meaning to ask, do you know the Earth Walking technique?"</p><p>Earth Walking might have sounded like it was the next step after Water Walking, but it wasn't. That might have been Snow Walking or Sand Walking which Konoha didn't exactly have an abundance of. What Earth Walking was was the precursor to Jutsu like Earth Release: Hiding Like A Mole, Double Suicide Decapitation Technique, Underground Fish Projection Technique, Tunnelling Technique… basically anything that required you to move underground.</p><p>It was a pretty basic skill in theory. The ground wasn't just one solid substance. It was a mass of fine particles packed together. And between those dirt particles were air spaces.</p><p>You projected chakra from the surface of your body, pushing the dirt in front of you around like a breaking wave. It was easier in aerated soil, harder in packed ground and near impossible in stone. If you had the skill, you could take some of that air and hold it to your mouth, increasing the amount of time you could remain underground.</p><p>The more advanced levels of techniques involved turning the dirt into substances that were easy to move, such as sand, around the body to enhance your ability to move.</p><p>It was also incredibly useful, particularly since I preferred to stay out of sight and then attack.</p><p>"I do." Mum nodded slowly. "It's fairly chakra intensive, you know."</p><p>"That's okay," I said brightly. "Even if I can only use it for a short period…"</p><p>It would also help in reaching <em> other</em> people that were hiding with it. You can't attack what you can't get at.</p><p>"Alright. We'll start on it this afternoon," Mum said firmly. "And make sure you bring your brother."</p><p>I smirked. Take <em> that,</em> Shika. "Of course."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc: Chapter 16</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: The Worst Three-Legged Race is from the Shippuden Flashback Arc. Thanks to DreamOfStories who reminded me that it took place between the Wave Arc and the Chunin Exams.</p><p>And thanks again to everyone who reviewed!</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 16</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Always remember that the future comes one day at a time. ~ Dean Acheson</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I swung by the Missions Desk to drop off my report. Iruka-sensei was there, and he brightened considerably and waved me over to his desk.</p><p>"Nice and early," he approved. "I'm glad you didn't pick that habit up from your sensei. We probably wont see his mission report for another three weeks." He huffed.</p><p>I nearly giggled. There was nothing Iruka-sensei hated more than late homework, and apparently that extended to mission reports. There wasn't actually an official time limit within which mission reports should be delivered, since there was always the chance of hospitalisation and so forth, so it was just understood that it should be as soon as possible.</p><p>He flicked through the pages slowly. I could see that he was actually reading what I'd written rather than just making sure I'd filled it out correctly.</p><p>"I guess Naruto must have already told you all about it," I said.</p><p>"I'm hoping most of that was exaggeration," he said ruefully. "But I see it really did get upgraded to A-rank."</p><p>"Yup. It wasn't really that bad," I tried to assure him. "I mean, it was scary at the time, but looking back I don't think we were actually in all that much danger."</p><p>He looked at me, a strange expression on his face. "You know, two months ago you were still my student at the Academy. If some one had told me…"</p><p>I waited for him to complete his thought but he just shook his head and smiled. "Graduating has been good for you."</p><p>"Thanks, Iruka-sensei," I said, not quite sure what he meant. He didn't say anything more, just stamped my mission report with the date and signed it, leaving me to wander away.</p><p>Ino was at training with Shika and they wouldn't be finished till later in the afternoon. Chouji was obviously the same. But I should probably visit Sakura.</p><p>I knocked on the door to the Haruno household. Sakura answered the door, a half eaten sandwich held halfway to her mouth. Her hair was tied up for practically the first time I've ever seen, a hasty almost lopsided bun. She brightened. "Shikako! You're back! Come in."</p><p>I followed her inside. There were books scattered all over the kitchen table.</p><p>"Do you want something to eat? Sorry about the mess, I've got my Basic Anatomy class at two and I was revising."</p><p>I declined the offer of food. "Basic Anatomy? You did apply for Medic-nin then." I felt a twinge of guilt. "I'm sorry. I know I said that I'd help you with that, but…"</p><p>She waved it off. "It's okay. I know that you can't control when you get missions. And you really did help, you know? I talked to Iruka-sensei like you said, and pretty much decided that the Medic Corps sounded best. It was pretty easy from there to get the application forms and stuff and then I just went to your Aunt and introduced myself and asked her to sponsor me. I met her once or twice with you before, I think."</p><p>I blinked. "Wow. That's… brave." It was a different kind of bravery to facing Missing-nins head to head, and probably harder for it. Social bravery. Introducing myself to strangers and asking for favours was the kind of thing that had me breaking out into cold sweat. "And she did?"</p><p>Sakura nodded. "Yeah, she looked through my Academy files and made me do some Chakra Control techniques to prove I had good control but she signed it off and the next day I was enrolled in the program." She beamed. "I wanted to go for field medic, but you have to complete the basic training and then do a six month residency before they let you."</p><p>"Something for the future then," I said. "Are you liking it?"</p><p>"It's great," she said sincerely. "We're only really doing theory at the moment, Basic Anatomy, Basic Chemistry, Cellular Biology, Nutrition and Health, that kind of stuff. Our only practical class at the moment is Chakra Control. We haven't even started learning medical jutsu or anything." She looked a little disappointed about that. "Once we finish Basic Anatomy we're supposed to be allowed to start doing dissections, starting with fish and moving on to small birds and mammals." She looked like she didn't know whether to anticipate it or wrinkle her nose.</p><p>That feeling reminded me of doing a science degree at university and making the important discovery that the inside of chickens smells much, much worse than you could ever imagine. Worse than fish, even. "When you start doing practicals, you should take some eucalyptus oil and put a few drops on the collar of your lab coat. That way, when the smell gets to you, you just duck your nose into your shoulder for some relief. You don't want to be known as the girl that had to leave because she couldn't handle it."</p><p>Sakura looked like she was making a mental note and underlining it. "Eucalyptus oil, huh?"</p><p>"Or anything that smells strongly." I shrugged. "Just a suggestion."</p><p>"No, that sounds good." She grimaced faintly. "I'm a lot younger than most of the others, so anything like that helps. There are only one or two Academy graduates. Do you remember Youbirin?"</p><p>"Suzu?" I clarified. "I'm not surprised he's there. His clan is pretty heavily into the medic-nin stuff. He was on your team, right?"</p><p>"Yeah. That didn't … go well. He's still a jerk, most of the time, but it feels great when I show him up." There was a gleam in her eyes that I recognised.</p><p>I snickered. "You do that. You're smart enough to be the top of your class, if you try hard enough. And you can always pester your tutors for extra reading or exercises to make up for not being able to name every bone in the skeleton by the time you were three."</p><p>"At the Academy, the clan kids were always the best… it's the same at the hospital, isn't it?" She looked a little dispirited.</p><p>I winced. That hadn't been my intention. "We have a bit of an advantage, yeah. But it's not as big as you think, and people with advantages tend to slack off a bit…" I admitted. "Just because he's ahead of you <em> now</em> doesn't mean he'll always be ahead of you. He'd probably make a half decent medic nin as he is… but you're not shooting for <em> half decent</em> are you?" I teased.</p><p>"Hmph!" She tossed her chin high. "I'm going to be the best!"</p><p>"You tell 'em, sister." I chuckled.</p><p>"So, uh, do you have any advice?" She asked awkwardly. "I mean, I know you do some medical stuff…"</p><p>Medical ninjutsu was so tricky because it required the user to have an in-depth knowledge of the human body. You couldn't just form the hand seals and let the jutsu do the rest. And the human body is a complex machine. There are thousands of different parts and thousands of different ways in which they can be damaged. A lot of study is simply rote memorisation of facts but there were a lot of facts to be memorised. Added to that was the difficulty of forming and holding Yin natured chakra. All in all, it was no wonder there was a only one in a hundred nin ever even <em> tried</em> to study medical ninjutsu.</p><p>"Memorise, memorise, memorise?" I shrugged. "There's not really much to say. Just, don't only study for the tests, you know? That's not why you're learning. Knowing the contractile process of sarcomeres might seem useless, but when you're healing muscle you don't want to align them wrong or your patient might never walk again."</p><p>"Right," she nodded seriously. "I wasn't really going to. This stuff really is interesting. More than calculating standard kunai pathways anyway."</p><p>"More useful too," I said wryly. "No one thinks about that when they're throwing kunai."</p><p>She snickered. We talked for a bit longer, but I didn't want to drag her away from her revising. She looked happier and more sure of herself than she had at the Academy. Maybe that was what Iruka-sensei had been talking about.</p><p>I went home, did my chores, checked over the deer and immersed myself in my seal work. It was a frustrating process. I'd mostly finished my comparative analysis of the different styles, and could tell you what seals with certain aspects did at a glance, but I was no closer to actually discovering how to put my own seals together. There just didn't seem to be any kind of underlying process.</p><p><em> Must be why people learn seals from Masters and not from books</em> , I mused. There was really no one in the clan that did more than copy medical seals. There was the option of asking Kakashi-sensei and hopefully Naruto would still end up meeting Jiraiya. Then I'd just have to come up with a way to ask him.</p><p>At three, I put away my books and wandered around to Team 10's training grounds to find Shikamaru.</p><p>"Shikako!" I heard Ino cry before she slammed into me, nearly lifting me off my feet. Ino was actually fairly tall, taller than me at any rate. "You're back! How was it? Lazy-bones over there wouldn't tell us anything."</p><p>She set me back down. Shikamaru was slouched opposite a Shogi board to Asuma-sensei and Chouji was sitting nearby eating chips. Team training, huh?</p><p>I waved at him.</p><p>"Sorry for interrupting your team training, Asuma-sensei," I said, bowing politely to him. I hadn't actually met him, apart from seeing him pick up Team 10 at the Academy.</p><p>He waved it off. "We're nearly finished here anyway. It's not like we were particularly busy," he said dryly.</p><p>"I was just going to fetch Shikamaru home for some clan training once you were done with him," I explained.</p><p>Shikamaru looked semi-interested. "Dad's teaching us?" Dad's teaching methods sat well with Shikamaru because they didn't actually force him to do anything.</p><p>"No," I said sweetly, setting up for the wonderful, wonderful realisation. This was going to be good.</p><p>"What?" He frowned. I resisted the urge to cackle.</p><p>"Mum is."</p><p>Shikamaru <em> froze</em> . His fingers twitched. His entire posture screamed 'escape and evade'. "Why don't you tell Ino about your mission?" he said weakly. "She's been wanting to hear about it all day." He cast a pleading glance at Asuma.</p><p>"Well, I don't want to interfere with <em> clan training</em> ," Asuma-sensei said, amusement writ all over his bearded face as he cheerfully threw Shikamaru to his fate. There was possibly a hint of 'ahaha, revenge!' in the idea.</p><p>Ino looked torn between wanting to hear my mission and gleefully throwing Shikamaru into his worst nightmare - <em> work</em> . "We can catch up tomorrow after training," she decided finally.</p><p>Shikamaru groaned, sounding like he was in pain already. He was so melodramatic. His next step would be to be completely uncooperative and refuse to move.</p><p>"Better yet," I said to Ino. "You can walk with us. I'll tell you on the way. You want to come too, Chouji?"</p><p>Game, set, match.</p><p>"Ohh, I've heard all kinds of rumours about it," Ino said, before kicking Shika squarely in the thigh. "Up, lazybones, time to get moving. We're not standing around waiting for you forever!" Her voice started to take on her shrill 'dealing with Shikamaru' tone. He <em> hated</em> it.</p><p>Chouji wandered over and offered me a chip. "That's kind of mean," he commented. "Setting Ino on him like that."</p><p>"I'd never get him home otherwise," I admitted. "We'll not if he knew there was <em> training</em> waiting for him and if I didn't say anything he'd suspect it anyway."</p><p>Chouji chuckled. "Why is your Mum training you anyway? I thought your Dad usually handled that."</p><p>I shrugged. "It's to do with my mission. Mum got worried, you know? So she wanted to make sure we weren't going to get hurt out there."</p><p>"Your mission?" Chouji asked.</p><p>"Well, it went downhill pretty badly," I started. Ino practically dragged Shikamaru over by his hair and the four of us headed towards the Nara Clan grounds.</p><p>I didn't spin the story nearly as much as I had with my parents. There wasn't really a need to. Chouji listened non-judgementally, while Ino oohed and ahhed over what 'her Sasuke-kun' had done. By the time we reached the house, she had stars in her eyes and was probably going to race off to see him.</p><p>I shrugged. <em> Not my problem</em> .</p><p>Training was harsh. It would surprise exactly no one to learn that Mum was a strict taskmaster. She didn't just teach us the Earth Walking skill I'd asked, she drilled us in Taijutsu, throwing skills - not just stationery but running, jumping, twisting throws - and even our Shadow Possession capture speed.</p><p>Even flushing my muscles with chakra to wash away built up lactic acid didn't help that much. Halfway through training I had to switch over to chakra enhancing everything like Shika was doing just to survive.</p><p>"Alright," Mum said, finally satisfied as the light started fading. "That'll do for now.</p><p>"For now?" Shika croaked, falling backwards to lie on the ground. "Never again."</p><p>"If you kept up with your training, you wouldn't be so tired right now," Mum admonished. "Don't think I don't know that you've been skipping your exercises."</p><p>Shika looked faintly guilty. "Troublesome."</p><p>"We've still got a long way to go." I yawned. I hadn't been slacking, but I think I could have been pushing harder as well.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning dawned bright and clear. It was easy to fall back into the routine of going to the training fields and waiting for Sensei to show up.</p><p>"Spar?" Sasuke offered with a smirk.</p><p>"You're on!" Naruto said, immediately.</p><p>I nodded. "Same rules as usual?"</p><p>Sasuke cast a considering gaze at both of us. "Let's have a free for all," he suggested. Teamed up, Naruto and I always beat him, though that was pre-Sharingan.</p><p>Naruto froze and then grinned. "I'm totally going to kick your ass," he said, elated. Because Sasuke had just recognised him as a credible threat in his own right.</p><p>We spread out across the clearing, triangulated to keep an eye on each other. Then, with no signal any observer would notice, the two boys blurred into action.</p><p>Silly, silly them, focusing on each other like that.</p><p><em> That</em> just gave me time to set traps and genjutsu and lure them in.</p><p>Naruto flooded the area with thick mist, which might have been a good way to stop Sasuke's Sharingan <em> if</em> he'd been able to move in it himself. He spammed Shadow Clones and Lightning Release: Radiating Shockwave all over the place in an attempt to box Sasuke in.</p><p>Sasuke, in turn, could dodge the loud and noisy clones, but had no luck at all in locating the real one. Every time he took out a clone, that only alerted the rest of them to where he was.</p><p>I dropped the real Naruto into an genjutsu the second he spread the mist. With no visual cues to alert him, he didn't even notice the change. It was easy, then, to pull him Headhunter style into the ground and put a remote activated knockout tag on his forehead. I needed his clones for now, but when I knocked him out, they'd vanish.</p><p>The clones knew I was there now, but they had even less luck finding me than they did Sasuke. I could avoid them much easier.</p><p>Sasuke was pushed back to the trees, and it was easy then to snag him in a Shadow Possession and smack a knockout tag on him too.</p><p>A single hand seal and I won.</p><p>By the time they came around, the mist had long since gone, and I was sitting calmly on a tree branch reading.</p><p>"That was mean, Shikako," Naruto whined.</p><p>"Hey, I pulled you out of the ground," I pointed out. "And we were sparring. It's not my fault you guys ignored me."</p><p>Sasuke 'hn'ed in acknowledgement. "I couldn't find the real Naruto," he admitted, starting our post fight discussion. "I'd have probably been better off setting up trip wires or neck traps so they didn't know where I was."</p><p>"Yeah, every time you popped one, I just sent more clones to that place," Naruto said. "We got you a few times, too."</p><p>"Yeah," I said. "But you couldn't see through your own mist, could you? That was dumb. You need a way to be able to find people in it if you're going to use it at all. Zabuza used sound and I can sense people in it…" I trailed off. "Can you still feel the chakra you use to make the mist? You could use that to find where people are in the mist."</p><p>"Not really." Naruto scrunched his nose up. "I could try though! That'd be cool!"</p><p>"It'd be a good idea. Scent is really the only other option… It'd be a good idea if you worked on a way too, Sasuke. Especially if we ever use it on missions."</p><p>"Hearing," he voted immediately. "It's more reliable than scent." Scent patterns would change depending on the wind, so wouldn't always be able to point out <em> exactly</em> where a person was. It was better for tracking because it lasted long term but it took more training to learn, as well.</p><p>We discussed the fight a bit more, until Sensei showed up.</p><p>"You're late!" Naruto hollered. By Kakashi standards, he actually wasn't all that late. Only an hour instead of the usual two or three.</p><p>"I was attacked by a raccoon and had to stop by the hospital to make sure it wasn't rabid," Kakashi-sensei said seriously.</p><p>Naruto and Sasuke snorted in disbelief. I ignored them and jumped to my feet, pulling three sealing scrolls out of my jacket.</p><p>"Here!" I chirped, handing a scroll to each of them.</p><p>"What is it?" Naruto asked eagerly, already unrolling it, while Kakashi-sensei looked at his with widened eye.</p><p>"It's a present!" I responded, waiting for them to unseal it. I liked giving presents. I liked seeing people's reactions when they unwrapped them.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei regarded his like it might be a live explosive note.</p><p>Naruto pressed his chakra into the kanji to disgorge a picture frame. It was from our celebratory dinner, of the four of us playing Shogi. It was a good picture. I was gesturing at the board and talking to Sasuke who was almost smiling while leaning on Naruto who was grinning ear to ear, while Kakashi-sensei sat on the sofa, forearms casually braced on his knees looking over our heads. It was much less formal than our team photo.</p><p>"Mum had them printed," I said. "I thought you guys would like a copy."</p><p>The silence started to stretch. I began to wonder if it really was such a good idea.</p><p>"This is really awesome!" Naruto enthused, tackling me with a hug. His eyes were a little misty. "I'll put it on my shelf next to our team photo! Believe it!"</p><p>I giggled.</p><p>"Thanks," Sasuke said, voice soft. He tucked his scroll away into his pouch.</p><p>"You're welcome," I said.</p><p>"Well, it's nice to see you all so happy," Kakashi-sensei said after a pause. "Because it's back to doing D-ranks."</p><p>Naruto groaned.</p><p>We'd done a few more D-rank missions, weeding gardens and walking dogs and shopping for groceries and the utterly infamous catch Tora mission, before the Hokage offered us another C-rank.</p><p>"A small band of thieves have stolen a artefact from one of the ladies of the Daimyo's court. It's apparently made of solid gold, so is worth quite a bit," the Hokage explained. "But more than that, it's a traditional heirloom and an important symbol of the family. Your mission is to retrieve the statue with a secondary objective of capturing the thieves. None of the thieves are noted to have ninja training, but you should be on your guard all the same."</p><p>"You bet, old man!" Naruto exclaimed. "We'll have that statue back before you know it!" He grinned, folding his hands behind his head.</p><p>The Hokage chuckled. "I'm counting on you to do that, Naruto." He threw Kakashi-sensei the mission scroll.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei scanned through the details quickly. "Alright kids. Grab your mission packs and meet me at the gate ASAP. Short term mission gear only. This shouldn't take more than a day."</p><p>"Yes, Sensei," we chorused, scattering to retrieve our packs.</p><p>Mum was a little worried that we were taking another C-rank mission so soon, especially after what happened on the last one, but there was really nothing she could say. She had been a ninja too and for all her worry, she understood missions.</p><p>Sensei wasn't even late meeting us at the gate. "This is a 'find and retrieve' or a 'track and capture' mission. It's a little different from our last C-rank which was a standard 'body guarding' mission. We don't really have time to go over the details now, but I'll brief you when we get closer to the location," he said, perfectly business like.</p><p>We jumped through the trees, pushing hard but not enough to tire ourselves out. We seemed to be heading north, which made sense as the capital was located to the north-east of Konoha.</p><p>We broke for a late lunch, and Sensei spread out a map on the ground. "Now," he started. "We're not exactly a tracking team like Team Eight but that doesn't exactly matter. If you have enough information, you can substitute logical deductions about enemy movement to chase and pursue tactics. In some cases, that's even better, since we can cut them off from ahead instead of trying to run them down."</p><p>"Huh?" Naruto asked. "How are we going to find them?"</p><p>"According to our Intel the thieves who took the statue are headed towards Ikeda Lake. The palace guards pursued them as far as Toge Pass but were overcome. Therefore, they'll be either travelling on land following this forest path or sailing by boat down the Kanagawa river," Kakashi-sensei said, tracing both routes out on the map with his finger.</p><p>"If they were clever, they'd do both," I said, eyeing the map. "One with the real statue, the other with a decoy."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei hummed. "The palace guards reported there were only a small number of thieves, five or six, so it's unlikely they'll split up unless they're very confident in their skills… and trust each other."</p><p>Unlikely. The thing about thieves was that they stole things. Even from each other.</p><p>"We're going to split up into two teams and lie in wait for them. In terms of team balance, I should go alone and you three should stick together."</p><p>I nodded. It made sense. Splitting us up would weaken us, and none of us could offer much to Kakashi-sensei anyway.</p><p>"What do you mean by that?" Naruto asked, tilting his head in confusion. "Are you saying Sasuke needs all the help he can get?" It was said so innocently that I did a double take.</p><p>Sasuke twitched. "You're the one that needs all the help you can get." He turned to Sensei. "I know we're not up to your level yet, but isn't three to one too much? You could take Naruto off our hands. Subtract his skill from yours and we'll be even."</p><p>"You've got to be kidding!" Naruto yelped. "Why would you subtract my skills?"</p><p>"Because you've got nothing to add," Sasuke retorted smugly.</p><p>The words were harsh but their tones were more teasing than insulting.</p><p>"Settle down and pay attention," Kakashi-sensei admonished. "I'll watch the pier and you three watch the forest path. If the thieves appear, notify me immediately. Do not take them lightly. Our mission is to retrieve the golden statue."</p><p>It was a reminder that we shouldn't just willy-nilly attack the thieves. We had to make sure that we could retrieve the statue or it would all be for naught.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei withdrew two hollow bamboo tubes and handed one to me. I regarded it warily. What was this?</p><p>"We must proceed with utmost caution. If the thieves appear on my side, I'll send up a signal with this." He tapped the hollow bamboo tube. "When this Lightning Barrel is activated it will release one thunderbolt. Once you verify it, rush to that location."</p><p>A Lightning Barrel? They were used to send up signals, but they were rarely used because they were bulky and obvious. If you sent it up <em> everyone</em> would know you were there.</p><p>"Now remember," he stressed. "You are not to act alone."</p><p>We nodded and agreed that we wouldn't. It wasn't like we had any reason to go against Sensei's wishes. Not like the Zabuza situation.</p><p>We scouted out several kilometres of the forest track and after seeing no sign of the thieves, settled in the branches to wait. It was boring, but at least we were prepared for that.</p><p>"Incoming," I murmured, an indefinite period of time later. The chakra I was sensing was … strange.</p><p>The two boys sharpened to attention.</p><p>Below us, tramping slowly at civilian pace, came five men leading a horse. They were all wearing jackets with the same symbol on their backs, like some kind of gang mark. I <em> think</em> it was supposed to be a fish, but that wasn't the first thing that popped to mind.</p><p><em> Target?</em> Sasuke signed.</p><p><em> Not sure.</em> I signed back. It was possible, but it wasn't certain. This wasn't a busy path, but that didn't mean there wouldn't be other travellers.</p><p>The guy that was leading the procession was tall, with dark red hair tied back into a ponytail and a pointy goatee. His face was set in a smirk, that I disliked on sight, but more than that, his chakra was distorted. Heavy and thick, almost like slime.</p><p>The horse stumbled on the loose ground. The poor thing, it was probably overworked. They nearly lost it down the bank and into the river when the leader turned around. I couldn't see what hand seals he used, but a rope of chakra, dense enough to be both visible and solid, shot out from his hand and wrapped around the horse, pulling it back to safety.</p><p>"Idiot," he barked. "Careful with the treasure."</p><p>"Sorry, boss Jako!" The underling stuttered.</p><p>So he was the leader.</p><p>I signalled the others to retreat back so we could converse where they couldn't hear us.</p><p>"They've got the treasure!" Naruto hissed. "Let's get it."</p><p>"It could be a decoy, still," I said. "They might have called it the treasure because they knew we were here."</p><p>"There's five guys down there," Sasuke put in. "That's what Sensei said the whole force was. It looks pretty likely that that box is what we're looking for."</p><p>I nodded. "It does. But we're not going to just leap down there, okay?" I glanced at Naruto who might have done just that. "We need to set up a proper ambush. One of us going for the box while the others take down the thieves and call Kakashi-sensei. If we set off the thunderbolt too soon, they'll know we're here… too late and Sensei wont get here in time."</p><p>"We can take care of it ourselves!" Naruto argued.</p><p>"Sensei did say to call him," I reminded him. "Specifically ordered it, in fact."</p><p>Sasuke nodded. "Four hundred meters back. There's a bit where the bank is steep on either side of the path." He scratched a approximate map into the ground. "They'll have to keep together to get through there, so…"</p><p>"If I wait here…" I gestured. "I can get them all with my Shadow Possession. If Naruto sets off the Lightning Barrel and creates clones to tie the thieves up quickly once I've got them, that leaves you free to grab the horse and check the box to make sure it's our target."</p><p>It was a pretty simple plan. Naruto looked a little disappointed that it didn't involve more fighting, but reluctantly nodded.</p><p>"And be careful of the guy with the red hair. His chakra is … strange, and you saw that technique he used to catch the horse. It looked like some kind of Chakra String."</p><p>"Don't worry! None of these guys are even ninja," Naruto said. "They aren't a match for us."</p><p>I wanted to scold him for underestimating them, but didn't bother. He wouldn't listen.</p><p>"Fine, fine. You take the Lightning Barrel and we'll get into place. Maybe set some traps to stop them moving forward or backwards once they're in the ambush zone."</p><p>"Right," Sasuke said and we all sprung into action.</p><p>The pass was long enough for ten men to walk in single file, so the five of them should be in the middle of it before we attacked. It wasn't obvious to an untrained eye that it was a blind corridor either, up until this point the bank to the river had dropped away gently and the forest side had been steep but not impassable. That wasn't the case here. The river bank was a sheer drop and the trees were practically horizontal.</p><p>We strung wires up across the exit end of the path and reverse spring traps at the entrance. They'd pass over them easily coming in, but if they tried to turn around and leave they'd be in trouble.</p><p>"Okay, everyone ready?" I asked. "Sasuke, you mark when."</p><p>I tended to wait too long and be too cautious while Naruto was the exact opposite. Sasuke was the best of us at split second decisions like that.</p><p>We waited, tensed and ready. The thieves came into view. They stumbled and staggered and shouted. They passed underneath us.</p><p>"Now!" Sasuke yelled.</p><p>It all happened at once.</p><p>I dropped straight down, landing right in the middle of the group, shadow arching out and snaring them.</p><p>Sasuke sprang for the horse, using a kunai to pin it's reins to the ground and stop it moving. He used another kunai to slice the ropes holding the box down and lifted it off.</p><p>Naruto slammed the Lightning Barrel into the tree and shot a thunderbolt into the sky.</p><p>Jako reacted fast, too. With one hand, he shot a glob of chakra into the air, snaring the lightning bolt out of the sky, even as my shadow latched onto his and froze him in place. I couldn't stop techniques that didn't take hand seals.</p><p>The other hand shot a glob at Sasuke.</p><p>"Look out!" Naruto shouted, throwing the useless bamboo tube at Jako, and leaping to pull Sasuke out of the way.</p><p>I solidified my hold, spinning my hands until my palms were facing my eyes. If Jako tried again, he'd shoot himself in the face.</p><p>Sasuke twisted out of the way, trying to keep hold of the box and keep his footing on the steep rock. The boys collided, rolling back from the bank, the box wedged safely between them.</p><p>"Hey! What the hell is this?" Naruto shouted as he tried to stand and found the glob of blue chakra sticking his and Sasuke's hands together.</p><p>"Like it? I'm a natural born thief who's rotten to the core. So as you can see, even my chakra is foul." Jako chuckled. "Even a ninja is helpless when his hands are tied. When I get free, I'm going to kill you all."</p><p>"Whatever. Get off me, Naruto." Sasuke appeared very unimpressed at Jako's threat. He used his one free hand to wedge the box open. "This is the treasure," he confirmed.</p><p>"Good," I said, starting to feel the strain of holding so many people in Shadow Possession. "Can you tie these guys up now?"</p><p>We exchanged looks. Could they?</p><p><em> Oh, crap.</em></p><p>"Shadow Clone Jutsu!" Naruto shouted. Nothing happened.</p><p>"Idiot! You can't form hand seals with only one hand," Sasuke shot him down, then looked at me apprehensively.</p><p><em> Shit.</em> What were we going to do? I could try restraining them with the chains they were all carrying, but it would be tricky and not all that stable.</p><p>"I have knockout tags in my pouch," I realised, in relief. "Just stick one on each of them."</p><p>It was a little awkward, but it worked. Once they were out and down, I tied them up securely with ninja wire, taking extra care with Jako, so that he couldn't use his weird chakra again.</p><p>Then I tied a flash-bang tag around a kunai and threw it high in the air. It might not have been the pre-arranged signal, but hopefully Sensei would investigate.</p><p>"Let me see your hands," I said, hoping it wasn't anything serious. I tentatively touched the solid, almost <em> gooey</em> ball of chakra. It was opaque and I couldn't even see their hands inside it. I probed it with my chakra. "Hmm. It's strongly bonded together like Earth Chakra but almost liquid like Water Chakra… the bonds are already starting to decay…"</p><p>"Can you fix it?" Naruto asked hopefully.</p><p>I studied it a bit longer. "I think that it'll crumble apart on its own. Maybe two or three days."</p><p>"Like I can put up with him for that long!" Naruto snapped, though a bit of tension leaked out of his shoulders.</p><p>"That's my line," Sasuke retorted.</p><p>"So what's this mysterious treasure that we were sent to retrieve?" I asked, trying to distract them from arguing.</p><p>Sasuke grimaced and opened the box again.</p><p>It was… a teddy bear eating a fish?</p><p><em> Right.</em></p><p>"I can't believe they stole something stupid like that," Naruto lamented.</p><p>"You know, kids," a voice said from behind us. "When I said 'don't act on your own', funnily enough, I meant 'don't act on your own', as in 'call me <em> before</em> you do anything'"</p><p>We turned. Kakashi-sensei was giving us a 'not impressed' stare.</p><p>"We tried to signal you!" Naruto objected. "But they stopped the stupid tube thing from working!" He huffed and tried to wave his arms, only to fail as Sasuke didn't budge. "So it's not our fault."</p><p>"We achieved both mission objectives," Sasuke added, scowling.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei sighed. "So you did. Good job. Alright, I'll set a maker here so the local patrols can come and collect them. We'll take the statue back to Konoha with us… and what is up with your hands?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Four days later we were on our way back from another D-rank mission when I noticed one of the messenger birds circling overhead. The type and flight pattern was coded for a Jounin response, so I wasn't surprised when Kakashi-sensei spoke up.</p><p>"Well, how about we break here for the day? I have to go and submit a mission report." He smiled, his eye crinkling into a curve.</p><p>That was the beauty about being known for having lame excuses, I guess. He didn't even try and come up with anything believable.</p><p>"Bye, Sensei," I said, as Naruto grumbled.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei vanished with a cheery wave.</p><p>We looked at each other awkwardly for a second. "Want to do some training?" I asked. During the time they'd been stuck together, Kakashi-sensei had decided it was a great chance to do teamwork drills. Today, as celebration for finally being free, they'd spent the morning beating the crap out of each other.</p><p>I'd stayed out of it.</p><p>We were set to head back towards the training fields when Naruto twitched.</p><p>"Is that… supposed to be a rock?" He asked disbelievingly.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder. In such a public setting, I didn't automatically catalogue every chakra signature around us. My lips twitched. It was a very <em> square</em> rock. "Friends of yours?"</p><p>"Hmph!" Naruto marched forward, taking exaggerated steps.</p><p>The box followed.</p><p>I looked at Sasuke. He rolled his eyes, but there was amusement in his face. "What an idiot."</p><p>"A square rock with two eye holes like that doesn't exist!" Naruto finally shouted, turning around and facing it. "It's so obvious!"</p><p>"I should have expected that from my rival!" the box announced before exploding in a cloud of smoke and flying debris. A big cloud of smoke. "Hey! You used too much gunpowder!"</p><p>As the smoke cleared it revealed the hunched over forms of three coughing children. They were about eight years old and looked a little familiar.</p><p>"We are-" they shouted. "Moegi!" "Udon!" "Konohamaru!" "And together the three of us make: the Konohamaru Corps!"</p><p>"Just as I thought, it was the three of you," Naruto said, completely unimpressed. "Why do the three of you have goggles on?"</p><p>"We copied the old you," Konohamaru explained laughing.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Oh? You've been treating us so cold lately," Konohamaru complained.</p><p>"Well, what do you want?" Naruto asked, hands behind his head.</p><p>"You said you'd play ninja with us!" The three chorused with various degrees of hurt.</p><p>Sasuke rolled his eyes. "Ninja playing ninja," he scoffed. "I'm going to the training fields. Meet me there if you're coming." He walked on.</p><p>I was torn between following him and seeing what Naruto was up to.</p><p>"Really? Well…" Naruto stalled. "I have training to do. I don't really have time to play ninja anymore, right Shikako?"</p><p>I blinked at suddenly being drawn into the conversation.</p><p>"Who's this?" Konohamaru asked, as the three of them eyed me distrustfully. "Your girlfriend?"</p><p>Naruto's face was a study in panic.</p><p>"No, I'm his team mate," I corrected easily.</p><p>"Oh. Okay. Hey, are you going to play ninja with us too?" He perked right back up. "You can, if you're Boss's friend."</p><p>I was about to decline when an idea of utter mischievousness sparked alight. "Play ninja, huh?" I smirked. "I think I've got just the idea…"</p><p>Oh it was a delightfully wicked idea. I felt giddy just thinking about it. "Here's what we're going to do…"</p><p>The training fields were quiet when we got there. Sasuke was practicing his kata, alone in the middle of the clearing.</p><p>"See your target?" I asked the three.</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>"Sasuke is going to kill us," Naruto said, awe in his voice.</p><p>"Shush you. Remember the plan?"</p><p>They nodded again.</p><p>"Okay, Konohamaru. On your mark!"</p><p>I crept away, getting myself into position. Hey, even games of ninja had tactics.</p><p>"Now!" Konohamaru leapt out of the bushes, deploying another colourful smoke bomb. Sasuke blinked in bafflement as he was pelted with paper shuriken. He dodged automatically, hands going for his kunai before pausing as he registered what was going on.</p><p>In Sasuke's ninja manual there really wasn't a standard response when dealing with kids attacking you with fake weaponry.</p><p>I leapt and landed lightly behind him, arms going around him like a very poor version of a bear hug. In fact it was more of a, you know, <em> hug</em> . "Got you~" I sing songed.</p><p>The kids cheered.</p><p>"What the-" Sasuke stared, looking at me over his shoulder with wide eyes.</p><p>"Play along," I whispered in his ear as the kids dragged Naruto out of the bushes. He looked even more stunned than Sasuke.</p><p>I gasped and stepped backwards. "Oh no! He got loose! Run!"</p><p>The kids shrieked. Moegi grabbed Naruto's hand. "Oh, no, boss! We've gotta run!" She dragged him along. I winked at Sasuke as I slid around him.</p><p>"Faster, faster!" I urged. "He's gaining on us!"</p><p>They shrieked louder. I glanced over my shoulder and <em> grinned </em> so hard my face hurt. Sasuke was chasing us. And he was chasing us at the same speed we were running, not the speed of a serious ninja trying to catch someone.</p><p>We careenered down the streets back into town, the kids laughing and shrieking the whole way. And by <em> kids</em> I included Naruto. It probably wasn't the wisest of destinations. Of course we were going to hit someone.</p><p>It was just unlucky that that <em> someone</em> was a foreign ninja.</p><p>I skidded to a stop as Konohamaru crashed straight into a black suited ninja with a painted face.</p><p><em> Kankurou?</em></p><p>Yes, there was a blonde girl next to him carrying a giant fan. They were both wearing Sand forehead protectors. I expanded my chakra sense and shivered. There was Gaara, in the trees. And there were three more, over there. Genin level, too.</p><p>"That hurt, brat," Kankurou objected, grabbing Konohamaru by his scarf and lifting.</p><p>"Stop it, we're going to get scolded later," Temari said, casting a nervous look around. She looked mostly bored, but very wired. Like she'd had too much caffeine. Or like she was terrified.</p><p>In that vein, Kankurou's aggressiveness reeked of fear.</p><p>It reminded me, however young they were, however much they'd become our allies later… right now they were enemy shinobi whose mission was to kill us all.</p><p>"Hey! Let him go!" Naruto shouted. I winced. Of course Naruto's first action was to pick a fight.</p><p>"I hate impertinent brats like that," Kankurou said in disgust. "It just makes me want to <em> break</em> them."</p><p>I intervened. "Shinobi-san, you are from the Village Hidden in the Sand, correct? What is your reason for being in Konoha?"</p><p>It was an oddity that I had found amongst the ninja of different villages. We tended to address our home villages in a different manner than foreign ninja did. So to me, the Village Hidden in the Sand was well, that, while they spoke of it as <em> Suna</em> . The same went for Konoha.</p><p>It was Temari that answered. "We're here for the Chunin Exams," she said, showing her passport as she was required to do. I might have been only a Genin but in matters of village security, I still had the right to ask to see them.</p><p>I nodded, not surprised. I hadn't expect the Chunin Exams to be so <em> soon</em> , but that was the only reason they would be here now. "I see," I said. "May I remind you that the streets are regarded as civilian areas and that violence is prohibited in these locations? If you are wishing to train, I'm sure there are several designated training sites allocated for you."</p><p>Kankurou scowled fiercely, expression highlighted by his Kabuki paint. He looked like he was thinking about attacking anyway.</p><p>Behind me, Sasuke shifted into an attack ready position.</p><p>"Kankurou," a voice rasped. "You are a disgrace to our village." I'd sensed Gaara before, but he'd moved quickly, and now he was visible standing easily on a tree branch. His chakra felt… mad and it was like he was constantly radiating Killing Intent.</p><p>Kankurou froze. And then carefully and gingerly returned Konohamaru to his feet. Konohamaru scuttled back, so he was hiding behind Team Seven. "Gaara," Kankurou said, voice wobbling a little bit.</p><p>Temari looked uneasy. More than uneasy. She looked terrified. Oh, she was trying to hide it, but every line of her face, every twitch of her body, every hitch in her breath spoke of terror.</p><p>"Have you forgotten the reason we came here?" His voice didn't rise or waver and it <em> still</em> made all the hairs on my arms stand up.</p><p>"I… I know. They challenged us," Kankurou tried to explain. "See, here's what happened-"</p><p>"Shut up. Or I'll kill you." His eyes narrowed, just a fraction.</p><p>Kankurou backed down. Fast.</p><p>I could feel the astonishment radiating from my team mates. That was an over reaction, from our point of view.</p><p>"R-right. I was out of line. Sorry, Gaara. I was totally out of line," Kankurou babbled. Holding his hands out in a surrender pose. Temari shifted beside him.</p><p>"I'm sorry for any trouble he caused," Gaara said, turning to us. There was no interest in his voice or expression.</p><p>I bowed anyway. "It was just a misunderstanding. It was nice to meet you," I said. Gaara's attention <em> focused</em> the feeling of Killing Intent, but it wasn't particularly strong at the moment. It just had… potential.</p><p>Gaara reappeared on the ground in a swirl of sand, ignoring us once more. "Let's go. We didn't come here to play games."</p><p>"Alright, sure," Kankurou agreed.</p><p>We watched them go.</p><p>"So… what was all that about? Chunin Exams?" Naruto asked, puzzled. I felt like face palming.</p><p>"Err, boss? Those are the exams every Genin has to take in order to become a Chunin," Konohamaru explained.</p><p>"Oh! I am totally there!" Naruto exclaimed. "Chunin, here I come!"</p><p>Sasuke was still watching the direction that the Sand Siblings had gone. "That guy… with the gourd…" he muttered. "His eyes…"</p><p>I bit my lip. "Be careful of him, Sasuke. His team mates… they were terrified of him. Not just scared, full out terrified. I don't know if there's anyone that scares me so much." Not <em> quite</em> true. Kyuubi did. But I could hardly say that. "More than Zabuza scared us, even."</p><p>"I see," he said, but his eyes stayed focused down the street.</p><p>I dreaded the look in his eye, all humour from before gone, leaving nothing but a black void.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc: Chapter 17</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Over 100 reviews! Wow. Thanks, guys. This chapter is for Moka-girl, even if you might not get to read it for a week. XD</p><p>Happy New Years!</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 17</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Keep your wits about you, mage, </em> <em> <strong> true</strong> </em> <em> tests never end. - Pride Demon; Dragon Age Origins</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>After seeing Gaara I wasn't particularly surprised when Kakashi-sensei announced that he'd entered us into the Chunin Examinations.</p><p>I hadn't really expected the Chunin Exams to show up so <em> fast </em> though. We'd only been Genin for two months. There was a reason that Rookies were usually never entered in the Exams. The minimum qualifications to enter were eight completed missions, with at least one at a rank higher than D, and most rookies didn't manage to get that done so quickly. Added to that, with only two months experience we were at a severe disadvantage.</p><p>My initial reaction was to turn it down. Turn it down and get us to take a C-rank that would get us far away from here on the day of the Third Exam.</p><p>But that would solve nothing. Orochimaru wouldn't be stopped by the rules of the Exam. He'd find Sasuke no matter what. Leaving when I knew there was an attack coming… that was the height of cowardice.</p><p><em> To abandon your duty is not courageous. Below the courageous there is nothing.</em> The words of the First Hokage. Konoha ninja lived by them. Could I really abandon them now?</p><p>And, if not Naruto, who would fight Gaara?</p><p>What would happen to Shikamaru? To Ino? To Sakura?</p><p>Like with Zabuza, there was no avoiding this situation. Unlike with Zabuza, Sensei wouldn't be there to save us.</p><p><em> I thought there would be more time!</em></p><p>Unlike my apprehension, my team mates were much more excited.</p><p>"This is all voluntary. If you don't feel ready, you can wait till next year," Kakashi-sensei explained. "Whoever wants to take the exams, sign the application forms and come to room 301 at the Academy. It starts at 3pm, five days from now."</p><p>"Alright! Kakashi-sensei, you rock!" Naruto launched himself at Sensei, catching him in a tackle hug. Kakashi-sensei flailed, just a little bit.</p><p>"Why did I get the team of cuddlers?" Kakashi-sensei muttered, peeling Naruto off himself.</p><p>"Team Cuddler," I repeated, voice serious but I couldn't hide the mirth dancing in my eyes. I was distracting myself by latching onto something so ridiculous and I knew it. "I don't know Sensei, that's not exactly a name that will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies."</p><p>Sasuke snickered.</p><p>"We should totally have an awesome team name!" Naruto agreed, running with the idea as he was dropped back down to the ground. "And then when we introduce ourselves we can go all 'And we are the great Team…' uh." He frowned. "Team…"</p><p>"Team Sharingan," Sasuke suggested.</p><p>"No way!" Naruto yelped.</p><p>"We have more Sharingan than any other team in Konoha," Sasuke pointed out logically.</p><p>"We also have more orange and we're not being called Team that," I said dryly. "Besides we have 5 non to 3 Sharingan eyes so it's not really representative."</p><p>"You suggest something then, Shikako."</p><p>I was useless at naming things. "Team Triple S." They looked confused. I pointed at each of us in turn. "Shadow, Sharingan… Surprise."</p><p>Sensei choked on a laugh.</p><p>Sasuke snickered again. "Nah," he said. "We'd have to keep explaining it. Wouldn't be funny after the first time."</p><p>Naruto harrumphed. "Sounds like a Bingo Book rank," he muttered. Which was kinda the point. Only bingo book ranks didn't go past SS and even those were rare as hens teeth.</p><p><em> Team Destruction </em> and <em> Team Confusion </em> were thrown out for not being meaningful and <em> Team Friendship</em> was rejected for being too pansy.</p><p>"Team World Domination," I suggested offhand, going for the exact opposite of 'pansy'.</p><p>There was a pause. "Something you aren't telling us, Shikako?" Sensei asked dryly.</p><p>"Nah, that'd be too troublesome," I replied, yawning.</p><p>"Team Trouble, more like it," Sensei muttered.</p><p>Naruto laughed.</p><p>"Anyway," Kakashi-sensei cut in before we could start bouncing more ideas off each other. "These are the application forms." He handed us each a slip of paper. They were fairly straightforward.</p><p>I looked at the one in my hand.</p><p><em> Shikako Nara,</em></p><p><em> I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend the above named student for participation in the Chunin Examinations. </em></p><p><em> Jounin, Kakashi Hatake</em></p><p>"Do you think we're ready, Sensei?" I asked, being hit by the reality of the situation again.</p><p>It wasn't really the Chunin Exams that I was scared of, it was everything that was associated with them.</p><p>"I do," Sensei said seriously, eye crinkling with a good humoured smile. "I know we've only been a team for a short time, but I think you three know more about being a ninja than Genin with years more experience. You'll do fine."</p><p>"Yeah!" Naruto cheered. "I'll bet we'll go up against a lot of really wicked ninja. Like those Hidden Sand guys!"</p><p>"We wont be doing any mission from now until whenever you three finish the Exams." That was a polite way of saying 'fail' I think. "So you wont need to meet up here in the mornings."</p><p>I bit my lip. "Will you still train us, Sensei?" I asked hurriedly. "I mean, if we have five days we can still improve, right?"</p><p>If only there was some technique that would enable us to win against Orochimaru. I snorted at the very idea. Ninja fights didn't rely on techniques so much as <em> what you could do with them</em> .</p><p>We were nowhere <em> near</em> his league.</p><p>"Well," Sensei said. "It'd probably be best if you improved what you already know."</p><p>"Ple<em> ase</em> , Sensei?" Naruto begged. "You know tons of awesome jutsu, right?"</p><p>Sasuke also saw the benefits of it. "You must have some idea of the skills that they will be examining," he commented.</p><p>"The content of the Chunin Exams changes every time," Kakashi-sensei said. "And Jounin with students are very much <em> not</em> included in the planning process." He looked at us and sighed, stuffing his hands in his pockets. "Though I suppose it can't hurt to tell you that the Chunin Exams <em> usually</em> have three stages. Some kind of decision making test, a survival exercise, and a one-on-one tournament. Most of the older Genin will have probably done at least one Chunin Exam before, so you'll be at a disadvantage there too."</p><p>Sasuke scoffed. "That just means they failed."</p><p>"<em> If</em> I were going to teach you, what would you want to learn?" Kakashi-sensei asked blandly.</p><p>Naruto shouted 'cool jutsu' almost immediately. That boy had a once track mind.</p><p>"Hiding," I said slowly, mind working speedily, examining possibilities, tossing over ideas at warp speed. "And escape."</p><p>There was definite surprise on their faces.</p><p>"Eh?" Naruto asked. "Why would you want to learn <em> that?</em> We don't need to run away. We'll just kick ass!"</p><p>I shook my head. "We don't know the kind of opponents we're going to be facing, or how strong they are or anything. We already have some good attack and defence skills, but if we get totally out classed then …" I shrugged. There wasn't much likelihood that we'd be able to pick up enough to evade <em> Orochi-freaking-maru</em> but … maybe?</p><p>If we could get to the Tower fast (assuming that the Second Test was what I remembered)… would Orochimaru have a chance to attack? There would be Jounin at the Tower, probably, and surely he'd have better things to do than hang around Konoha looking for Sasuke?</p><p>Okay, that was a bit weak.</p><p>But what else could we do?</p><p>I'd had half a thought to come up with a way to remove the curse seal or transfer it or stop it from being placed but my studies in the sealing arts had ground to a halt <em> looong</em> before they reached a place where that idea was plausible. There were a few containment seals but they were incredibly complex and without knowing more about the curse seal I wasn't even sure that they would work, <em> if</em> I could manage to draw them up correctly.</p><p>We couldn't out fight him. We couldn't out run him. We couldn't call for back up. Unless we managed to uncover something before the Exam, we couldn't alert anyone.</p><p>We were trapped.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei tapped his chin. "Hmm, well I suppose that is a reasonable request."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei started us with a really thorough rundown of escape and evasion tactics. I was a little surprised, though I don't know why. Sensei <em> is</em> good at not being found, and he also has a pack of tracking dogs and tracking is the opposite partner of evasion. It wasn't jutsu, but it was useful skills all the same. How to move through the trees without disturbing them, erasing our tracks behind us, avoiding attracting attention, using chakra to walk over grass without bending it - which I had never even considered before - navigation at speed, hiding our chakra… There was a lot to consider. We'd done <em> some</em> stealth work at the Academy, but not much. And certainly not so thoroughly.</p><p>"Alright, I think that's enough for the day," Kakashi-sensei said clapping his hands together as we dropped out of the branches, panting. "I guess we better meet tomorrow if you want to keep working on it…" he trailed off like he would very much like us to change our minds.</p><p>All three of us nodded. He sighed. "Fine, fine." He puffed away in a cloud of chakra smoke.</p><p>"Hmph. I still think that we'd have been better off learning a cool new jutsu," Naruto muttered.</p><p>I shrugged, unremorseful. "You've still got your Hidden in the Mist jutsu to work on, don't you? And I know Sasuke has been practicing with his Sharingan. Besides, we don't know what kind of jutsu we need so if we do learn something it might end up being useless and we'll have wasted our time…"</p><p>He didn't argue my logic, but he still clearly didn't like it, crossing his arms and pouting.</p><p>"Idiot," Sasuke sighed. "Want to spar again?"</p><p>Naruto jumped at the chance, but I shook my head. "I've got to get home; Mum's expecting me."</p><p>I waved goodbye as I left, the sounds of a fight starting up behind me almost immediately. It <em> was</em> good practice for them to fight each other and not one of us ever fell for the same trick twice.</p><p>"There you are," a lazy voice interrupted me when I was halfway home. "I've been looking for you."</p><p>I paused and turned. The voice was right. The face was right. The lazy slouch was right. The agonizingly slow pace of his walk was right.</p><p>But the chakra was <em> wrong</em> .</p><p>"You got recommended for the Chunin Exams?" 'Shikamaru' asked, tilting his eyes towards me.</p><p>"Mmm," I confirmed, wondering who was playing what game. "So did Team 10."</p><p>He looked surprised. Mistake. "Kakashi-sensei told you?"</p><p>"No," I said and didn't elaborate. Shikamaru and I knew each other's thought processes inside out. There was never any <em> need</em> to elaborate.</p><p>His expectant expression faded after a few seconds and he yawned. "Troublesome."</p><p>It was someone that knew us, at least. They wouldn't be able to do such a close imitation otherwise.</p><p>"I'm not going to enter," he said. "You shouldn't either. These ninja are very advanced and they have no mercy. If you try to fight them, you could lose your life."</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>This was a ninja village. Tests weren't confined to classroom hours. Simply having our names put forward for the Exams looked like it was enough. It made sense. Entering weak shinobi in the Exams could potentially embarrass a village and we <em> were</em> Rookie Genin.</p><p>His chakra was a dark olive green, rough to the touch like canvas over thick padding. Like a flack jacket, a Chunin vest. It was a sight that invoked comfort, familiarity, safety in every child in Konoha.</p><p>There was only one person it could be.</p><p>Now how to pass the test? To show what they wanted to see, or prove I had exceeded their expectations and noticed the test at all? Or both?</p><p>"That's mean, Iruka-sensei," I sighed, wrapping my arms around myself. "Targeting my weak spots like that. I might not be the best shinobi but I can handle myself. Besides, how are we ever supposed to know what we can do if we don't <em> try</em> ?"</p><p>His surprise was palatable. The image of my brother faded and Iruka-sensei stood there instead. "Very good, Shikako," he said, chuckling. "When did you work it out?"</p><p>I could have given a lot of answers. Instead I tilted my head and gave him an approximation of Sensei's cheerful 'not telling you anything' smile. "It's way too much effort for Shika to come <em> looking</em> for me," I said. It was truth, to a degree, but lacking any factual information.</p><p>Okay, maybe I was slightly annoyed at him. It was a <em> mean</em> test. I wondered if he was going to try something different with the others - there wasn't anyone that would shake Naruto's confidence in himself.</p><p>"You know," Iruka-sensei said hesitantly. "You don't have to take the Exams now. There's nothing wrong with waiting a few months for the next round."</p><p>I smiled at him, properly this time. "It's okay, Iruka-sensei. We'll do fine."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"So did anything weird happen to you guys last night?" I asked casually at training the next morning.</p><p>Naruto looked startled. "How'd you know? I was… uh… talking to the Konohamaru Corps when this jerk kidnapped Moegi!"</p><p>Sasuke looked immediately suspicious. "I got attacked too…" he said. "You think?"</p><p>"It was a test," I confirmed.</p><p>"Wait, what?" Naruto waved his hands. "Back up! What test?"</p><p>"To see if we were good enough for the Chunin Exams, I assume," I said. "Someone transformed into Shikamaru and tried to convince me not to participate, but I called them on it."</p><p>"Yeah, that was the gist of what I got too," Sasuke said. I eyed him. There was definitely more to the story there. "I fought the guy off." He shrugged.</p><p>"Naruto?" I asked expectantly.</p><p>"Yeah," he frowned. "This jerk kidnapped Moegi and ran off with her. He tied her up and everything. You're saying that was a test? She was really scared."</p><p>"She probably knew you were going to rescue her," I said. I didn't think Iruka-sensei would do anything that would frighten a child long term, but maybe he hadn't been doing all the tests? "It probably gave her an exciting story to tell at the Academy."</p><p>"I guess," he muttered.</p><p>"So how'd you rescue her?" Sasuke asked, sounding completely indifferent.</p><p>Naruto perked back up. "I was really awesome," he said, tucking his hands behind his head and grinning. "He had her tied to a tree, see? And he made a ransom demand - that I get the scroll of sealing… actually, it's weird that he chose <em> that</em> isn't it?"</p><p>"That's what Mizuki…" I trailed off.</p><p>Naruto nodded. "Yeah. I mean, it must be famous if so many people know about it?"</p><p>"Or it was someone that knew you knew what it was," I finished. Sasuke looked from one of us to the other.</p><p>"Anyway. I distracted him and made a Shadow Clone that snuck up behind them, then I used the Replacement Jutsu to switch Moegi out for a straw doll!" he looked really pleased with himself.</p><p>"Wait, what?" I said, sure I'd misheard.</p><p>"I switched Moegi out for a straw doll," he repeated. "With the Replacement Jutsu, you know?"</p><p>I looked at Sasuke. He looked at me. He shrugged.</p><p>"You switched Moegi with a straw doll," I repeated.</p><p>"That's what I said. Geeze," he said, annoyed.</p><p>"Could you… show me? Like, pretend I'm Moegi… and Sasuke is the bad guy," I said, moving to stand next to Sasuke.</p><p>"Okay," Naruto agreed readily enough, but he still looked puzzled. "So here I am distracting the jerk over there," he said. "And that's my clone in the tree…"</p><p>He was actually pretty good at creating clones without smoke. It just sort of … wavered into existence. Shimmered, maybe.</p><p>"And then it used Replacement…"</p><p>There was a tugging pull, like I was using Replacement but wasn't in control. I nearly fought it, but managed to stop myself. I wasn't sure if that would leave me in tiny pieces across the clearing and I didn't want to find out.</p><p>"And viola!"</p><p>Sasuke stared blankly the straw doll he was holding. I blinked at the clone.</p><p>"Huh," I said. "Where did the straw doll come from?"</p><p>Naruto shrugged. "Where ever Replacement stuff normally comes from."</p><p>Oh. My. God. Words failed me. He didn't… He … Unconsciously my fingertips formed a circle. If I ignored how impossible it was, then it was the most brilliant thing I had ever heard of. How had I not noticed this before?</p><p>I sat down. Hard.</p><p>"Of course," I said. "If you cant make illusionary clones because you don't have the chakra control for it… why did we assume you could do the other two? They aren't that different." There were a lot of theories about Naruto's <em> unique</em> transformation skill. I'd already seen him transform <em> clones</em> into other objects, but I'd passed that off as them being chakra constructs. They didn't have to keep a human shape.</p><p>"What?" Naruto asked baffled and a little worried.</p><p>"Pass me the doll?" I asked Sasuke. He handed it over without complaint. "It's a chakra construct. Like a Shadow Clone… I see." I looked at Naruto's blank face and decided to explain. "A normal Replacement Jutsu switches your body with an object nearby that is of similar size and mass. It's like… a rubber band. If you stretch it out and let it go the recoil pulls the two things in opposite directions. What you're doing is <em> creating</em> an object instead of finding an already existing one. Like a Shadow Clone. That means you can swap other people with it because one half is always you… just the opposite half to what people normally use."</p><p>"Does it matter?" Naruto asked.</p><p>I smiled. "It's a good thing, Naruto. A very good thing. It means that you don't have to look for things to switch with, right? So you can almost teleport. If you need to get behind some guy, you just create something there and bam!"</p><p>He brightened. "That does sound pretty awesome!"</p><p>I nodded. "Okay. So. Replacement training?" I suggested, looking at Sasuke. He looked as baffled as I felt.</p><p>"But we know how to do that…" Naruto whined, scrunching up his nose. "We're doing lame training with Sensei and now you want to do Replacement Jutsu?"</p><p>I was losing him. "Replacement Tag," I suggested slyly. "You can take only three steps, everything else has to be Replacement Jutsu." I switched out with a tree branch and dropped down behind him. "Tag!" I said gleefully, before using another Replacement Jutsu to cross the clearing.</p><p>"H-hey! Get back here!"</p><p>Even now that I knew what he was doing, it took a while to actually see it in action. Now that he was consciously aware of it, it seemed to disrupt his concentration and his Replacement Technique failed more times than not. Still, Sasuke and I had to scout out possible targets to switch with, which didn't happen automatically. Once Naruto got back into the swing of it, he had an advantage over us.</p><p>Then again, Sasuke and I had better control and a much faster switching speed. If he didn't take us by surprise, we could usually get away in the time it took him to tag us.</p><p>Replacement was a remarkably underused jutsu. Getting the hang of using it in combat took skill which was why Jounin tended to use it more than Genin did. That being said, done right it was <em> lethally</em> effective. There was a reason it was considered one of the three basic skills any ninja must know.</p><p>And if I had to turn training into a game of tag so that we could work on it, then so be it. I wasn't exactly complaining.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei showed up and started running us through more evasion drills. Some of them had the feeling of being highly practiced, but since Kakashi-sensei had never taken a Genin team before I wasn't sure.</p><p>It was tricky and exhausting work and afterwards I'd go home and be run into the dirt by Mum. She hadn't exactly been happy to hear that Shika and I had been nominated for the Exams, but she was determined that we were going to <em> survive</em> it if we entered.</p><p>Shikamaru considered the whole thing troublesome beyond words, but there was the understanding that Ino would make things <em> hell</em> for him if he didn't show up.</p><p>The days ticked down. We sparred some more. For the first time I looked at those fights and tried to <em> measure</em> our progress. Naruto had improved by leaps and bounds, that much was easy to see. He still threw around chakra draining attacks like nobodies business, though they were much more targeted now; Shadow Clones deployed for specific actions, combination attacks and simple but effective tactics that could utterly blindside you. You had to put Naruto down hard and stop him completely or he'd just. Keep. Going.</p><p>Sasuke was faster now. He tended to revert to using Fire Ninjutsu when he could, though fighting wave after wave of Naruto clones forced him to match them with either Taijutsu, or more usually, kunai, shuriken and ninja wire to thin the herd. Two kunai, with a long stretch of ninja wire between them, thrown to opposite edges of the clearing was remarkably effective at clearing large numbers of them. It reminded me, vaguely, of a cheese grater. After that, Naruto and his clones tended to duck when faced with projectiles. When his Sharingan was active, attacking him head on was sheer folly, though it still had limitations - mostly speed and grappling. Eyesight doesn't play a huge role when someone is about three inches away from you.</p><p>Myself? Well, I could match the two boys, and they'd never teamed up on me so I didn't know how I'd fair there.</p><p>"Three o'clock this afternoon. Academy Room 301," I said, swinging my feet over the edge of the bridge. "Do you think we should bring mission packs?"</p><p>Sasuke paused, clearly he hadn't considered that. "It's in the Academy."</p><p>I shrugged. "That might just be where we're meeting." And I didn't know what the time period between the First and Second Exams was. Straight away? Next day?</p><p>"Short term mission gear?" Sasuke suggested. We were, after all, taught how to survive in the wilderness with nothing more than a sharp stick and those you could find a dime a dozen; mission gear just made things easier.</p><p>I hummed. "I'll bring an extra sealing scroll just in case."</p><p>"Chunin Exams, Chunin Exams," Naruto chanted. "This is going to be awesome!"</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - First: Chapter 18</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - It's funny that you mention Hammerspace… XD And yeah, pretty much everything with Orochimaru is delaying the inevitable. At this point Orochimaru is a Hero Killer; they don't stand a chance against him.</p><p>There's a little bit in here at my attempt at explaining some of the reactions in the anime fights, since no one ever seems to get actually hurt. You'll know what I'm talking about. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 18</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> A journey is best measured in friends, rather than miles. – Tim Cahill</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The Academy was bustling with ninja from all nations. We'd shown up early as a tactical decision to scout out the place and competition before the Exam began but it was already busy.</p><p>The Academy building was compact and sturdy and highly defensible. It might have been quicker and easier to chakra walk up the walls to the third floor and enter through a window instead of having to push through all the people in the hallways, but that was actually impossible. You couldn't get in through the upper level windows.</p><p>Inside, the hallways were maze-like and the staircases staggered by being in different places on each floor. It was annoying and time consuming, but it was also a good way to slow and confuse invaders and attackers. The three of us were able to navigate with ease, having spent years in this building already, though some of the foreign ninja looked annoyed and confused.</p><p>Honestly, if they couldn't find <em> stairs</em> they weren't very good ninja at all.</p><p>The second floor was even more crowded than the first and it only took the intrusive spike of a genjutsu for me to know why. I grimaced. It was an area-of-effect genjutsu. I did weaken it, shunting it into a corner of my chakra system, so that the illusion wavered and diluted in front of my eyes like I was staring through coloured cellophane, so I could see both what was real and what they wished us to see.</p><p>"You're taking the Chunin Exams and you can't even get past <em> us</em> ?" one of the two 'Genin' guarding the door scoffed as they kicked back a green suited boy. Rock Lee, I suspected, though I had never seen him before. The spandex suit was too distinctive.</p><p>"Let's move on," I murmured quietly to my team mates. Sasuke's eyes flickered to me - he saw the genjutsu too. But Sasuke preferred confrontation to secrecy. I didn't mind underestimation, and Naruto liked tricking people, but he <em> demanded</em> to be taken seriously.</p><p>"Please let us through, we're supposed to go in there," Tenten pleaded to the two door guards, making her own attempt at getting past them. She was knocked back too, landing heavily beside her team mate. It was a decent tactic, making people think you're weak, but not worth taking injuries before an unknown exam. Well, unknown to them.</p><p>"Aww, that's harsh," someone in the crowd muttered in protest. Idly, I wondered how many of the watching Genin believed the scene playing out in front of them, and how many were playing their own 'underestimation' game.</p><p>"Did you say harsh?" One of the two door guards scoffed.</p><p>"Don't kid yourselves," the other picked up. "We're being nice by comparison. The exams will make this look like a picnic. "</p><p>"Some of you will die in the Exams, others will be wrecked for life. Some of you may go crazy. For Chunin it's always life and death," the first said, puffing up and staring at the crowd.</p><p>"You think it's a joke?" the second one continued. "Chunin are qualified to <em> lead</em> missions. The lives of your squad members are in your hands. So you better be tough enough to take the heat. "</p><p>Give away. Giant give away. They were <em> way </em> too proud of what being Chunin meant to be anything but. There was no way that these two were actually Genin.</p><p>"Real nice speech," Sasuke interrupted cuttingly. "Now both of you step aside and let me through. And while you're at it, release the genjutsu, we can see through your illusion anyway. We're going to the third floor."</p><p>"Well aren't you the smart ones," one of the door guards said. "Big deal. So you noticed an illusion. Let's see you deal with <em> this</em> ." He lashed out towards us, one leg arching in a wide swing.</p><p>Sasuke responded smoothly, shifting his weight backwards and kicking out to precisely block and deflect the incoming attack.</p><p>Then, suddenly, Lee was between them.</p><p>"He's fast," Naruto said in awe.</p><p><em> Really fast</em> , I noted.</p><p>Sasuke disengaged easily, sliding backwards and reappraising someone he had just written off as weak.</p><p>"Hey," a smooth, but annoyed voice interrupted. His white eyes marked him as a Hyuuga and his covered forehead as a Branch House member. Neji. "What happened to the plan? I thought you were the one who said to keep a low profile and not to let anyone see our skill level."</p><p>That was… doubtful, but it was a smooth recovery on Neji's part. If you couldn't make it work for your whole squad, make Lee seem like he's the best of you.</p><p>"I know, but-" Lee protested half heartedly.</p><p>"Never mind, it's over, forget it," Tenten said, trying to peace keep between her two team mates. I knew how <em> that</em> felt.</p><p>"It is just that," Lee said, turning to Sasuke with a strange intensity in his eyes. "I wish to challenge you!"</p><p>Tenten sighed. It was an 'I should have expected that' sigh. "But Lee… the Exam…"</p><p>"I challenge you," Lee repeated, ignoring her. "Everyone is always talking about the Uchiha Clan and how great they are. I want to see if it is true. I figure you will be a good test for me."</p><p>Beside me, Naruto scowled. "Uchiha, Uchiha, Uchiha. It's always Sasuke."</p><p>"You've heard of the Uchiha Clan and yet you're challenging me? You must be even more psycho than you look, if that's possible." Sasuke was irritated, yet it didn't seem like he was going to turn the fight down. The Uchiha Clan was a sore spot for him, understandably. Living up to the weight of that name must have been difficult; the dead have no faults.</p><p>This was just what we needed, some idiot stirring up problems when we most needed to stick together. "There will probably be chances to fight during the Exam," I mentioned, trying to divert them. "And we really need to get our applications in before three…"</p><p>"This will not take long," Lee said.</p><p>That <em> riled</em> Sasuke up. It was one thing to be challenged. It was another thing entirely to be dismissed. His eyes narrowed. "You're right, this wont take long. You're going down."</p><p>"Excellent. We will take this to the practice hall." The Academy had a number of large empty rooms that could be used for a variety of purposes, assemblies, physical exercise and so forth. It would be better to find one of them to fight in than to do it here, in the corridor.</p><p>Neji snorted. "I'm not waiting around while you pick fights. Tenten, let's go."</p><p>"R-right, Neji," Tenten said. "Lee, don't take too long, okay?"</p><p>I sighed and followed the boys towards the hall. My chances of talking Sasuke down now were pretty much non-existent.</p><p>I studied the set of his shoulders quietly. Annoyance, yes, but he was still confident that he could best Lee. And maybe he could, but not here. Being inside would limit Sasuke from using his jutsu, and I was hopeful that he wouldn't exhaust himself before the Exam by using ninjutsu anyway.</p><p>Still…</p><p>"If you two aren't finished by half-past, I'll stop this fight," I said quietly as we entered the hall. There was a large open floor, and a balcony for observers. "We are <em> not</em> going to be late."</p><p>Sasuke nodded curtly as they jumped down to the floor below.</p><p>"Why is it always Sasuke?" Naruto muttered as we stood on the balcony looking down. Sasuke and Lee had taken to the floor, staring at each other.</p><p>"There'll be plenty of people to fight during the Exams," I said. "Don't worry about that. Now… watch how Lee fights, so that if we come up against him later we'll know how to beat him."</p><p>"Heh," Naruto smirked. "Bet he's not expecting that."</p><p>Sasuke darted forward, leading with an easy right cross to the head. A testing move. He wasn't moving at his full speed, yet, but it was still fairly fast. Lee made him look like he was moving in slow motion, ducking down easily into a crouch and pivoting, a long leg circling around to knock Sasuke's legs out from beneath him.</p><p>"Leaf Whirlwind!"</p><p>Judging someone else's speed was hard. I could <em> almost</em> match Sasuke normally and if I chakra boosted like everyone else was always doing I doubled my speed. That was <em> maybe</em> about the speed Lee was moving right now, and he was still wearing his weights. I doubted this was even his maximum encumbered speed.</p><p>Sasuke flipped over the leg sweep, hand springing to gain some distance. Lee didn't let him recover, leaping into the air and descending on him with a roundhouse kick.</p><p>"Leaf Hurricane!"</p><p>Sasuke twisted, not quite able to dodge the blow, but enough to take in on his crossed forearms instead in the face. He skidded backwards.</p><p>"You're fast," Sasuke acknowledged. "I think it's time to use <em> this</em> ." His chakra pulsed and his eyes began to spin, black bleeding into red.</p><p>"Your Sharingan will not help you here," Lee declared. "I know your technique. I know that you can see through your opponents Jutsu. That Sharingan gives you the ability to read his chakra and decipher his handsigns and movements. You can guess what he's going to do almost before he knows himself. The problem is… Taijutsu is a little bit different."</p><p>"What's your point?" Sasuke said, annoyed.</p><p>"I do not try to hide or disguise my moves. I do not have to. Even if you can read them, you still cannot stop them. You are too slow. Your eyes may be quick enough to keep up with me, but if your body cannot follow, what good does it do?"</p><p>He blurred forward again, swinging low and kicking upwards, intending to catch Sasuke in the chin. Sasuke tipped sideways, the foot grazing past his cheek. It wasn't much of a dodge, but it worked all the same.</p><p>I knew that speed was one of the weaknesses of the Sharingan, and I'd made sure Sasuke knew it too. It had given me a chance to work on my speed in combat and forced Sasuke to work out how to predict and respond to fast movement.</p><p>Lee retracted his foot, then lashed out again, catching him square in the stomach, throwing him back across the room.</p><p>"Grk!" Sasuke grunted as the air was forced out of his lungs. He forced himself to his hands and knees, then stood, trembling slightly.</p><p>Unfortunately, that was the most common conclusion to ninja fights.</p><p>They didn't end through broken bones or injuries… but through chakra exhaustion and disruption of the chakra enhancing your muscles. If you hadn't practiced moving, fighting, living without chakra boost, like I had, moving without it seemed impossible. It was almost like paralysis. That was why, after a strong hit, most ninja staggered and stumbled on their feet as their chakra system resorted itself.</p><p>Pain disrupted chakra. That was the whole principle of escaping genjutsu. But it could work against you, too.</p><p>"You know what I believe?" Lee said, once more taking his opening stance. "There are two kinds of ninja. Those like you who are born with talent and do not have to work at it. And those like me who have to train every day of our lives! The fact is, your Sharingan is the worst match for my extreme Taijutsu."</p><p>Sasuke had gone from annoyed to angry. He darted forward again, lashing out with all kind of combinations. Lee blocked everyone and retaliated with moves that Sasuke could only move with or lessen but never avoid completely.</p><p>It was interesting though, that Sasuke was sticking completely to Taijutsu too. It wasn't a good idea to use Ninjutsu inside but he hadn't brought out any kunai, or shuriken or used ninja wire to trip or slow his opponent.</p><p>He was playing Lee's game.</p><p>A strike caught Sasuke in the stomach, throwing him up into the air.</p><p>"Here's what I mean!" Lee said, jumping up after him in the pattern of Shadow of the Dancing Leaf. "Now I will prove my point. That hard work beats out natural talent."</p><p>The bandages on his hands started unwrapping, coiling and snapping in an invisible breeze. I didn't see how he could do <em> that</em> without chakra.</p><p>And then they were slammed into the wall, pinned by an incongruous and fragile looking paper pinwheel.</p><p>I blinked, startled.</p><p>"Alright! That's enough!" The deep booming voice of a tortoise admonished. It was a summon. I could see the Konoha headband that it wore around it's neck.</p><p>"What the hell?" Naruto yelped. "It's a turtle!"</p><p>Lee, momentum halted by his trapped bandages, was pulled out of his technique, landing in a crouch on the ground. Sasuke twisted agilely, landing like a cat. The deep set of his mouth betrayed his aggravation.</p><p>"That last technique is forbidden! You know that!" The tortoise growled.</p><p>"I am sorry. I did not mean to… I was not planning to use a forbidden jutsu. I mean, I was just in the middle of a fight… you understand…" Lee flailed about trying to explain himself.</p><p>I ignored him, mostly, jumping down to land lightly beside Sasuke.</p><p>"Alright?" I asked, assessing him. It didn't look like anything more than his pride was hurt.</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>Naruto landed ungracefully beside us, apparently deciding he didn't want to stay up on the balcony alone.</p><p>Lee's telling off continued behind us. "You're a disgrace! You think you'll get away with a bunch of lame excuses like that! A shinobi never reveals his techniques unless it's absolutely necessary. It's such a basic rule you should know it by now."</p><p>"You saw his hands, didn't you? When he took off the tape? I bet old bushy brow has been training until he drops. Day in and day out," Naruto muttered, voice hushed.</p><p>I hummed. "His Taijutsu is very good. But that just means we should avoid matching him in a Taijutsu fight."</p><p>Sasuke smirked at the idea. I was relieved to see the anger drain out of his body. He nodded. "This Exam will be interesting…"</p><p>There was an explosion of chakra smoke, revealing a man standing on the back of the tortoise. Maito Gai.</p><p>Konoha had such an eye-catching history of 'dead lasts' that most people probably assumed that Gai was one of them. Rock Lee's enthusiastic mimicking of his sensei didn't help matters, particularly among our generation.</p><p>The truth was, Gai was one of the lauded prodigy children. The genius kids. He had graduated the academy at seven, fought in the war, made Chunin at eleven and Jounin at fifteen, only slightly behind Kakashi's own record. That was, I suspect, where the 'Eternal Rivalry' developed, between the two that were so far advanced from the rest of their peers.</p><p>Out of all the sensei for the Konoha Twelve, <em> Kurenai</em> was the one that was most ordinary. She had been born to the extended family of a minor ninja clan, become a Genin at nine (the graduating age due to the war) and Chunin at thirteen. She had reached Jounin at twenty six after a long hard struggle to be taken seriously as both a kunoichi and a genjutsu user.</p><p>Regardless, for all his ridiculous posing, Maito Gai <em> deserved </em> to be a Jounin.</p><p>"Hey, what's shaking? How you doing, everybody? Life treating you good? Hi, Lee."</p><p>It was just that everyone's first impression was <em> shock.</em> Maybe a little bit of horror. The fact that he was over the top melodramatic… It was sort of something you had to grow used to.</p><p>The three of us exchanged glances with each other that conveyed large amounts of 'what the hell?' combined with 'who is this guy?' and 'can we get out of here?' as Lee and Gai-sensei had a Moment behind us.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I like Lee and Gai. It's just… this might not have been the best introduction of them.</p><p>"That is…" Sasuke trailed off. "How did I lose to that guy?"</p><p>"Well, it's kinda sweet the way they're all huggy and stuff," Naruto said. That comment was Naruto through and through. Yeah, he might have been shocked and weirded out but he could still appreciate people who acknowledged each other.</p><p>"Tell me, how is Kakashi-sensei?" Gai-sensei asked, turning to us.</p><p>"… Do you know him?" Sasuke asked. He didn't <em> quite</em> sound either surprised or disbelieving but the potential was there.</p><p>"Do I know Kakashi?" Gai chuckled then smiled brightly. His teeth gleamed. "Well people say … he and I are arch rivals for all of eternity."</p><p>"There's just no way!" Naruto blurted out, shocked.</p><p>"How dare you?" Lee asked, outraged. "If Gai-sensei says it is so then-"</p><p>"Let it slide, Lee. A ninja's actions always speak louder than words," he said seriously. Then vanished. "My record is 50 wins and 49 losses." He was freaking behind us. It startled me so badly I nearly lashed out even though this was not a combat situation. "Which is one better than his, by the way. You see, I'm stronger than Kakashi… and faster."</p><p>"You see?" Lee said, vindicated. "Gai-sensei is the best there is."</p><p>Ninja battles weren't just fought on strength and speed, though. And a ninja's prowess didn't always come from fair fights. That didn't make either of them <em> better</em> than the other, just better at different things.</p><p>"Now Lee, you should accompany these fine young ninja to the classroom. Remember, give it your best." He gave us all the thumbs up and vanished.</p><p>We shook ourselves out of our stupor.</p><p>"Right," Sasuke said. "We need to get to room 301."</p><p>We turned to leave, but I hesitated, turning back to Lee. This had bothered me. "Oh, Lee? You said there were two kinds of people, genius' and those who worked hard… but just because someone has natural talent doesn't mean they don't have to train hard, you know. All shinobi walk the same path to grow stronger; even if some start out ahead of the others it doesn't matter because, in the end, we're still all headed for the same place…"</p><p><em> Sasuke works hard too, y'know?</em></p><p>I hesitated, unsure if what I'd said made sense, then shrugged.</p><p>"All shinobi are walking the same path to grow stronger?" Sasuke asked, brow arched as I caught up to him.</p><p>I bumped our shoulders together playfully. "Don't you know some journeys are better with friends?"</p><p>Naruto clenched his fists. "Yeah! You might have started out ahead of me, but I'm catching up! Believe it!"</p><p>"I think you already have," I said.</p><p>We grinned at each other. Or well, Naruto grinned, I smiled and Sasuke smirked.</p><p>"I'm glad you all came," a low, calm voice intruded on the moment.</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei," I chirped and darted forward to hug him. That was a little bolder than I normally was, to be sure, but it was Kakashi-sensei. Safe. Familiar. "I'm glad you're here!"</p><p>"Yeah! You're the best sensei ever!" Naruto echoed. "Even if you <em> are</em> late all the time and read those weird books…"</p><p>I think all three of us shared a joint vision of what <em> could have been</em> . Green spandex. Youth and vigour. We shuddered.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei eyed us warily but didn't ask. He probably knew exactly who we'd run into. "Riiight. Now, you can formally register for the Chunin Exams. Only groups of three are allowed to apply for and take the Exam, so it's good you all came together."</p><p>That hadn't been what he'd told us when handing out the applications - exactly - but I'd known it anyway. There was a faint twitch of surprise from the boys though, so maybe that was one of those 'unspoken rule' things that they'd missed out on.</p><p>"I'm proud of you." He smiled. "Couldn't ask for a better team. Good luck."</p><p>"We wont let you down, sensei," Naruto said, beaming at him like a sunrise in the morning. A few words of praise and his confidence was unshakable.</p><p>I nodded firmly and we opened the doors and stepped inside.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - First: Chapter 19</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: These chapters aren't short, but they still don't seem to cover much, do they?</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 19</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a deadly situation, and they will then live. When people fall into danger, they are then able to strive for victory. ~ Sun Tzu</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Room 301 was one of the larger rooms in the Academy. It was almost an auditorium and could sit almost three hundred people. It looked like it was almost full to capacity, too.</p><p>I cast an assessing glance around. There were Konoha headbands, unsurprisingly, which made up the majority of the candidates. There were Sand ninja, some from Rain, some from Grass and a few from Waterfall. And of course, Sound.</p><p>Some of the teams stood out. There was obviously Gaara's team, who though sitting quietly, had a large clear space around them. There was a team from Rain carrying heavy combat umbrellas. There was a Konoha team whose mean age seemed to be over thirty; they probably had <em> experience</em> but were either lacking in techniques or had come off long term injuries. It'd be a mixed bag whether they'd be difficult opponents or not.</p><p>Of course, most of them would drop out during the First Exam, so it wasn't <em> really</em> worth making a detailed list.</p><p>And there was of course, the rookies.</p><p>"Sasuke, where've you been?" Ino greeted, practically jumping on him.</p><p>Sasuke gave her his annoyed face. I noticed, though, that he didn't throw her off.</p><p>"Boy, you have no idea how much I was hoping you'd show up here. I've missed those broody good looks of yours." Sometimes… sometimes I had to wonder if Ino was just playing us all for fools. It was just something in the choice of words, in the tone of voice…</p><p>Or not. Maybe I was just being too paranoid.</p><p>"Took you guys long enough," Shikamaru drawled, off to the side. "I thought you were going to be late."</p><p>"Of all the habits I could pick up from Sensei, that's the one I want the least," I said, snorting. "We got waylaid on the way in."</p><p>"The genjutsu?" Shika asked with a modicum of surprise. There was no way I should have fallen for that.</p><p>"Nah," I replied. "One of the other teams. Year above us. Rock Lee, Neji Hyuuga and Tenten. Watch out for them."</p><p>He nodded, warning received.</p><p>"Well, well, whaddaya know? It looks like the whole gang's back together again." Kiba's grinning face was feral under the fur lining of his jacket hood. Akamaru barked happily, perched atop his head.</p><p>"You guys too huh? Man, everyone's here for this stupid thing," Shikamaru complained.</p><p>"Yup, here we all are. The Nine Rookies," Kiba laughed. That is how stupid names stick. Someone says something like that and years later you <em> still</em> get called the Rookie Nine. "This is going to be fun. At least… for those of us good enough to make the cut. Right, Sasuke?" His tone was teasing but not <em> really</em> challenging. He and Sasuke actually got on surprisingly well.</p><p>"Kiba. Careful you don't get overconfident." Sasuke smirked.</p><p>"Just you wait," Kiba boasted. "We're going to blow you guys away. We've been training like crazy."</p><p>"What do you think we've been doing?" Naruto retorted, pointing at him. "Sitting around picking daisies? You don't know what training means!"</p><p>"Uh, don't mind Kiba," Hinata tried to say, poking her fingers together. Poor Hinata, she disliked conflict even more than I did. Added to the fact that she lost what remained of her confidence around Naruto… "I'm sure he didn't really mean anything by it."</p><p>"Don't worry about it, Hinata," I smiled at her. "We're all going to do our best."</p><p>"Damn right we are," Ino said enthusiastically. She <em> still</em> hadn't let go of Sasuke. "I didn't come here to let some little test beat me."</p><p>"Sheesh, you guys sound confident," a voice interrupted us. One of the Genin had left the crowd and come over to talk to us. He was average looking, silver hair wasn't that unusual in Konoha, with glasses and a purple uniform. Something about him niggled the back of my mind. I didn't recognise him and he wasn't distinctive enough to ring any bells.</p><p>"I mean, no offence, but you're the nine rookies, right? Fresh out of the Academy. I wouldn't go making a spectacle of yourselves. You might wanna try keeping it down."</p><p>People who said 'no offence' generally meant every offence. There was a note of high handed arrogance in his voice too, under the condescension.</p><p>"Well who asked you?" Ino snapped. "Who are you?"</p><p>"I'm Kabuto Yakushi. But really-"</p><p>The rest of his speech faded out in a blur of white as I realised with a jolt of horror just who was standing there in front of me.</p><p>Kabuto.</p><p>That was Kabuto.</p><p>Orochimaru's spy. Madara's ally. The one responsible for the mass Edo Tensei.</p><p>Of course he was here.</p><p>I wanted to kill him.</p><p><em> I wanted to kill him.</em></p><p>I shuddered at the sheer vehemence of the emotion.</p><p>I'd never met him before, never seen him, never talked to him, but for what he was going to do, I wanted to kill him.</p><p>I wanted to kill him so badly it hurt… and I <em> knew </em> I wasn't going to get the opportunity.</p><p>He might have been playing the failed Genin but he was Jounin level. Able to stand off against Shizune and Tsunade and Jiraiya however weakened they might have been. He had some kind of automatic regeneration ability. Not to mention the level of sheer control that allowed him to use Chakra Scalpels in combat.</p><p>I wasn't that good.</p><p>Added to the fact that he was currently a Konoha shinobi, if I even attempted to attack him with the necessary force it would certainly cast question on <em> me</em> , even under the rules of the exam.</p><p>"Do those cards of yours have any info on the other candidates? Individually?" Sasuke asked, eyes narrowed.</p><p>I tuned back into the conversation, quickly, slightly disturbed at myself.</p><p>"Well, I can't promise my information is complete or perfect," Kabuto answered. "But I've got something on just about everyone. Including you guys, of course. So which one is it? Anything you know about them. A description, where they're from, whatever."</p><p>He wanted to ingrate himself with us, likely he had been told to keep an eye on us or at least Sasuke. That was the only reason I could think of that he was showing us this stuff. That and he was arrogant enough to think we wouldn't spot the irregularities. It was possible, possible that he might have got information on Konoha Genin legitimately, but other villages? Unlikely.</p><p>But we hadn't even known about the Exam till a week ago. Which meant that if Kabuto had info on us he probably had info on all of Konoha's forces. That was a little more terrifying.</p><p>"Rock Lee," Sasuke stated.</p><p>I hesitated. I didn't particularly want to ask Kabuto, but it would be a good way to alert the Rookies. "And the team from Sand with … Gaara." They had said his name, hadn't they? Probably.</p><p>"Aww, you even know their names, that's no fun," Kabuto complained with an easy going smile. "Let's see, Rock Lee first. Looks like he's about a year older than you guys. Mission experience; eleven C-ranks and twenty D-ranks. His squad leader is Maito Gai and in the last twelve months his Taijutsu had radically improved. But his other skills are pretty shaky. Last year, he got a lot of attention as a Genin but for some reason he chose not to participate in the Chunin Exams. This will be his first time as a candidate, same as you guys. His team mates are Tenten and Neji Hyuuga."</p><p>That was actually pretty detailed information. It made me narrow my eyes. Especially the spiel about Lee's skills improving; that implied Kabuto was keeping a close eye on the <em> abilities</em> of Konoha shinobi if he bothered to note that much about a Genin.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>"Okay, now for Gaara of the Desert. Mission experience, eight C-ranks and … get this, one B-rank as a Genin. But there is this… he's survived every mission without getting a scratch on him. There's not a lot more information on this guy. His team mates are Temari and Kankurou, who are also his siblings. All three of them are the children of the Fourth Kazekage. Temari is skilled with Suna Tessen and wind ninjutsu, while Kankurou is a noted member of the Suna Puppet Corps."</p><p>There was a stunned silence.</p><p>"From the looks of it, all the villages have sent exceptionally skilled Genin to the Exams this time around."</p><p>"Piece of cake," Naruto scoffed. "They'll be begging to know <em> our</em> names by the time this Exam is over."</p><p>Kiba laughed. "Damn right they will."</p><p>There was a hint of scorn in Kabuto's eyes as he pushed his glasses back up. Just for a second, but I saw it.</p><p>Yeah well, we'd show him.</p><p>"Well, at least you're confident," he said with a smile. "Maybe that will be enough, yeah? Well, I better get back to my team. The Exam will probably start soon."</p><p>"What a jerk," Ino huffed as he walked away.</p><p>"Hey. He was tryin' to help us," Naruto protested. "With those info cards and everything."</p><p>I shook my head minutely, making sure he was out of hearing range. "She's right, Naruto. Be careful around him," I looked over at the rookie group. "He shouldn't have had that information." There was a name for people that had information they shouldn't. Spies. Traitors.</p><p>In a social structure that demanded village loyalty, spies were abhorred.</p><p>"Perhaps we should inquire to our sensei later, when the Exam is over," Shino suggested, his voice monotone. "If it is suspicious, then our superior officers should be informed."</p><p>"Right," I said. "Who knows? He might be part of the Exam… but he might not." It was only a small thing, and I wasn't sure how much weight the suspicions of a few rookie Genin would have but it was a start.</p><p>There was an explosion of chakra, a huge surge in the air, as the Exam Officials all body flickered in. There was nearly twenty of them, all dressed in the grey Intelligence Division uniform.</p><p>"Alright you baby-faced degenerates, pipe down and listen up!" A voice bellowed. "It's time to begin. I'm Ibiki Morino, your protector and from this moment … your worst enemy."</p><p>There was a sort of stillness in the room for a split moment. Not quite fear but the acknowledgement that there was someone in the room who was far, far more dangerous than you.</p><p>Ibiki just radiated that kind of danger.</p><p>"Now if we're ready, we'll proceed to the first stage of the Chunin Exam. Hand over your paper work. In return you'll be given a number. This number determines where you will sit. We'll start the written test once you're all seated." He held up a pad of tear-off numbers to punctuate his statement.</p><p>"The what? Did he say… written?" Naruto's eyes were wide with horror.</p><p>"You'll do fine," I said reassuringly. "Just stay calm, <em> stay quiet</em> and listen to the instructions. You're a super ninja, remember?" I emphasised 'quiet' in hopes he wouldn't give the game away if I needed to use Shadow Possession on him.</p><p>It took almost half an hour to get everyone registered and seated. The Chunin were <em> good</em> at splitting up team mates. Sasuke was several rows behind Naruto but I was all the way across the classroom from them. Not good. The further the distance, the greater chance my shadow would be noticed.</p><p>"Everyone, eyes front." Ibiki barked, writing on the blackboard. "There are a few rules you need to be aware of. And I wont answer any questions so you better pay attention the first time around! Rule number one is this: The written part of the Exam is judged on a point reduction system. Contrary to what some of you may be used to, you all begin the Exam with a perfect score of ten points. One point will be deducted for each answer you get wrong. So if you miss three, your final score will be seven."</p><p>Ten points, but we were given only nine questions, which meant even if you got all nine wrong, you still had one point. Not that the points mattered, in the end.</p><p>"Rule number two. Teams will pass or fail on the total scores of all three members."</p><p>That was a pretty common Konoha concept. A few of the foreign shinobi looked put out, but teamwork was our guiding principle.</p><p>"Rule number three. The sentinels you see positioned around the room are there to watch you carefully for any signs of cheating. And for every incident they spot, they will subtract two points from the culprits score. Be warned, their eyes are extremely sharp. And if they catch you five times, you'll be dismissed before the tests are even scored. Anyone foolish enough to be caught cheating by the sentinels doesn't deserve to be here."</p><p>And there was the qualifier on the 'to be caught'. His intentions were pretty obvious.</p><p>"I've got my eye on you guys," one of the sentinels said mildly, smirking. I recognised him. He was one of the Chunin that were often on guard duty or working at the Hokage's Tower. So the others were probably Chunin or higher. Meaning, actually slipping things past them would be hard, especially in a constrained environment like this, but they probably had an acceptable level that they allowed to succeed.</p><p>"One more thing. If any candidate should get a zero and fail the test… then the entire team fails. The final question wont be given out until fifteen minutes before the end of the testing period. You'll have one hour total. Begin!"</p><p>I flipped over the test, casting an eye down the questions.</p><p>Code, looked like an intermediate level cipher…</p><p>Physics based mathematics, <em> Line B in the diagram shows the trajectory of a shuriken thrown at enemy C by ninja A, seated atop a tree seven meters tall. Formulate and describe the trajectory required if C were positioned at points D, E and F. Also predict the furthers possible range of the shuriken and explain how you arrived at your answer…</em></p><p>History, <em> In the Second Great Ninja War the battle of Mount Tokachi Pass had five major objectives, identify and describe the ways in which the combined ninja forces went about achieving these objectives and discuss their successes and failures…</em></p><p>Economics based mathematics, <em> The supply train for a minor outpost normally carries twenty five crates of rice and twelve crates of assorted meats for an agreed upon price of 60,000ryo. However, due to a food shortage in nearby towns…</em></p><p>Politics and rules, <em> Name and describe the seventh clause of the Convention of Humane Treatment regarding captured prisoners and the six major addendums and how these apply to both active duty shinobi and civilians…</em></p><p>Physiology<em> , Name and describe the most likely injuries that would result, and grade them according to their Injury Severity Score, if a shinobi were a) crushed using a Doton Jutsu, b) stabbed with a…</em></p><p>Another mathematical calculation, a question on the shinobi rules of conduct, and a calculation to find the blast radius of an explosion that used a mix of explosive tags and nitroglycerin.</p><p><em> Oh, boy</em> . Nope, there was no way in hell Naruto would be able to answer any of these. Sasuke wouldn't be able to answer any of these.</p><p>I glanced sideways surreptitiously. Naruto was tense and stiff but he didn't look like he was freaking out enough to do something stupid yet. Good. It had only been a few minutes.</p><p><em> Just don't panic</em> , I pleaded in my head. <em> Just don't panic, Naruto. </em></p><p>It didn't really matter if you answered the questions at all, as long as you didn't get caught cheating. So as long as Naruto could sit and wait it out…</p><p>I grimaced. He'd probably try something stupid. It was just his way.</p><p>Mentally, I crossed my fingers, and turned back to the test. The code was a piece of cake and the mathematical problems made me want to trade my soul for a calculator but they were doable. The history and rules questions were easy and I was pretty sure I got the physiology one.</p><p>It took me twenty minutes to do, and I doubled checked the answers and sighed in relief. Now to check up on my team mates.</p><p>Sasuke looked like he was writing and I could feel the agitation of his chakra that meant his Sharingan was active. Using his Sharingan to copy the movements of one of the Chunin plants, huh? Clever.</p><p>Naruto was still frozen. It was unlikely that he would work out the need to cheat. He was just too <em> honest</em> for that. Although, if he could produce Shadow Clones already transformed into something else, then he could probably do pretty well on his own here.</p><p>I tucked my hands in close to my chest and activated my shadow. It slunk across the floor, under the benches. There were two aisles that needed to be crossed, and I couldn't exactly <em> see</em> the floor in between them, but judging from the angle of the shadows I could see, I estimated a safe crossing point hidden in someone else's shadow.</p><p>Slowly, but surely, it made it's way to Naruto. It was hard to Possess someone when I couldn't see if my shadow was on them. I was forced to rely on my chakra sense. It was hard with some many people in one place, but Naruto was a burning ball of sunshine. Unmistakable. I just had to make sure I got <em> only</em> him.</p><p><em> Shadow Possession Complete.</em></p><p>I reached out and picked up my pencil. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Naruto doing the same. There was a tugging-pull on my muscles that made it feel like my pencil weighed twice as much as Naruto instinctually fought me.</p><p><em> Don't scream.</em></p><p>'Trust me', I wrote at the top of his page. And things became much easier as he stopped fighting the jutsu.</p><p>Then, carefully, I wrote overtop of the answers that I had already calculated, making sure my pencil followed the exact same lines and that I didn't miss anything. It didn't take all that long. There were only nine questions, and I had already done all the hard work of answering them.</p><p>Test complete, I put down the pencil, released my jutsu, lay my head down on the desk and went to sleep. Not that I actually slept, the atmosphere was too tense, but it was the principle of the thing. I watched the room through the bars of my eyelashes as it slowly emptied with every team caught cheating. Some of them were pretty blatant about it. I mean, five tries was fairly lenient.</p><p>I could hear Akamaru barking quietly, which gave me a pretty good idea on how Kiba was doing. This Exam would be a piece of cake for them, with Hinata's Byakugan and Shino's Kikai. They were more a tracking team, but it looked like they could probably double as a covert intelligence gathering team. Actually, the Exam was probably pretty easy for Team 10, too, since they <em> were</em> basically an intelligence gathering team. I could see Ino's slumped body, like she was taking a nap too, and was quietly glad that the angle was all wrong for her to target me. I'd never been on the receiving end of the Yamanaka Mind-Body Switch Jutsu and I didn't really want to. Tenten was using chakra strings to adjust the flaps on the lights and using them as a reflective surface. That was a pretty clever use of the environment. A Genin I didn't know had some kind of periscope poking out of his sleeve and was doing his best to keep it from the sentinels. There was a large amount of chakra imbued in one of the windows, distorting the reflection. Someone else was tapping fingers on the desk in a rhythm too blatant to be anything but a code.</p><p>The clock ticked on.</p><p>"Listen up! Here's the tenth and final question. But first, there are some things you need to know. These rules are unique to question 10, so listen carefully and try not to let them frighten you."</p><p>I didn't bother to lift my head off the desk. Around me, the room was thrumming with tension already. Ibiki really did know how to lay it on thick.</p><p>"Rule number one," Ibiki said slowly, making sure he had everyone's attention. "Each of you is free to chose <em> not</em> to be given the final question. It's your decision."</p><p>"Whoa, so what's the catch?" Temari nearly shouted. "What's say we decide we don't want to do it, what happens then?"</p><p>"If you chose not to take the tenth question, regardless of your answers to the other nine, you'll get a zero. In other words, you fail. And that means both your team mates fail as well. But… If you accept the question and get it wrong, not only will you fail, you will be bared from taking the Chunin Exam ever again!" He smirked at the gasps of outrage.</p><p>"Hey! That's bull! What kind of bogus rule is that? There's tons of people here who've taken the test before!" Kiba protested, standing up. Given that Kabuto had admitted to taking it <em> seven</em> times, that was a reasonable assumption.</p><p>"I guess you're just… unlucky. I wasn't making the rules before. But I am now," Ibiki said.</p><p>I could hear the sinking realisation of 'oh, shit. He's serious' all around the room. It wasn't <em> quite</em> there yet. He'd need to push just a little bit more.</p><p>"Of course," he added, almost kindly, "if you don't want to take it, you don't have to. If you're not feeling confident, then by all means, skip it. You can come back and try again next year."</p><p>He'd given everyone two clear paths to follow. Even if there <em> had</em> been other options, no one would be thinking of them now. By giving the impression that there was no stigma attached with leaving, it seemed the more attractive of the two choices.</p><p>"Now if you're ready, the tenth and final question. Those who don't want to take it, raise your hand."</p><p>No one wanted to be the first to leave. There was a building silence, almost panic ridden as everyone looked about, thoughts racing, trying to see what their team mates were going to do.</p><p>"That's it, I can't take it anymore, I'm out!" One of the Genin, said, slapping his hands down on his desk. His entire team was called out. I noted they were wearing uniforms and idly wondered if they were the Chunin plants. It was a good way to get the ball rolling because after that, it was like the dam had broken.</p><p>Teams bailed right and left.</p><p>I still didn't lift my head. I was pretty sure Sasuke wouldn't do anything, but Naruto was always a wild card, even to us. I vaguely remembered something about him causing a scene in this test. Of course, Naruto had changed from what he could have been, so even that was no real guide to his actions.</p><p>"The tenth question is the kind of thing that challenges you, mentally, emotionally, even spiritually… are you <em> sure</em> you're ready for it?" Ibiki asked, deceptively mild.</p><p>More teams bailed.</p><p>"This is a decision that could change your life. If you fail, you will never have the chance to become a Chunin."</p><p>It was like the entire room had stopped breathing.</p><p>"Don't underestimate me!" Naruto hollered, standing and pointing at Ibiki. It looked like the stress <em> had</em> got to him, though he attacked it rather than fleeing. "I don't quit and I don't run! You can act tough all you want, you guys aren't going to scare me off! No way. I don't care if I <em> do</em> get stuck as a Genin for the rest of my life. I'll still become Hokage someday!" He was fierce and blazing with conviction.</p><p>And just like that, no one would leave.</p><p>"Well, I admire your determination, if nothing else," Ibiki said wryly. "For those of you remaining there's just one thing left to do. That's for me to tell you… you've passed the First Exam."</p><p>Tension gave way to confusion.</p><p>"Hold on, what just happened?" Someone demanded. "What's going on? Where's the tenth question?"</p><p>"There never was one. Not a written one at least." Ibiki was grinning. Not a 'I'll eat you' grin, but … happily. It looked disturbing all the same, but it wasn't cruel. "Actually, you could say that your decision to stay was the answer to the tenth question."</p><p>"Wait a second, so the other nine questions you gave us were just a waste of time? Is that what you're saying?" Temari demanded, sounding pissed off.</p><p>"No. Not at all. Quite the opposite," Ibiki explained. "The first nine questions had an important overriding purpose. To test your abilities to surreptitiously gather strategic intelligence under the most adverse circumstances."</p><p>That was a long, fancy way to say 'cheat while being watched'.</p><p>"Let me explain," he continued. "You see, my objective was to test you not only as individuals but as a team, and as how well you function as a part of that team. That's why the test was scored on a team basis, so that you knew everything you did or failed to do would directly affect your team mates. I wanted to see how well you would handle the pressure."</p><p>That was probably why Temari was so pissed, actually. At this point I wouldn't want to be the one responsible for making <em> Gaara</em> fail, either. That would be a one way ticket to a shallow grave, if there was even enough of you left to bury.</p><p>Ibiki continued to explain the test. It was difficult in order to encourage cheating. Those who cheated badly failed. It was pretty straightforward.</p><p>"Information, it can be the most valuable weapon in battle. How well you gather information can determine whether a mission is a failure or a success. There'll be times you have to risk your life to get it."</p><p>He raised his hands and took of his bandanna. I straightened a bit, propping my chin in my hand. His skull was a mess but under the visceral horror it did make me wonder what the <em> purpose</em> of those marks had been. Burn marks, puncture wounds, cuts and slices… they told a horrible story but why the skull? It's not exactly the first thing you think of. Hands, eyes, even feet… they'd be more permanently damaging and therefore more terrifying as well as being incredibly sensitive.</p><p>He was wearing full gloves though, not the fingerless ones most shinobi wore. It was possible his scars weren't <em> just</em> limited to his head...</p><p>"Of course, you must always consider the source of your information. Intelligence gathered from an enemy is not necessarily accurate. Always bear this in mind. Disinformation can be worse than no information at all. It can lead to the death of comrades or the loss of a village. That's why I put you in the position where you had to gather accurate intelligence. Cheat, in order to survive. Those who weren't good enough at it were weeded out. Leaving the rest of you."</p><p>He put his bandanna back on and scanned the room.</p><p>"The tenth question was the main point of the whole exam. The final question gave you two choices, both difficult. You could play it safe and chose to skip the question, though it meant that both you and your team mates would be failed. Or you could take the question, knowing if you got it wrong, you would lose your chance of ever being Chunin. It was a no-win situation. But just the sort Chunin have to face everyday. For example, let me give you a hypothetical mission. To steal a document from an enemy stronghold. You have no idea how many ninja the enemy has. Or how heavily armed they are. Further more, you have reason to believe that the enemy expects you. You might very well be walking blindly into a trap. Now do you have an option of taking a pass on this insane mission, of saying 'my comrades would rather live to fight another day'? Can you chose to avoid danger? No. There will be many missions that seem almost suicidal if you think about it. But you do not think about it. You think only of the goal achieving it through courage and discipline. These are the qualities required of a Chunin squad leader."</p><p><em> There will be many missions that seem almost suicidal if you think about it. But you do not think about it. You think only of the goal …</em></p><p>Almost suicidal? Like trying to save your team mate from an S-ranked missing nin?</p><p>It wasn't a mission, but it might as well have been. There was<em> no</em> option of avoiding it. It was something that would happen and something that would have to be dealt with. Just like Kabuto. Like Madara. Eventually.</p><p><em> So don't think about how impossible it is. Only think about </em> how<em> it can be done.</em></p><p>I breathed in. Breathed out.</p><p>It wasn't quite an epiphany. I'd already <em> known</em> this. But there was something about having someone else voice it… to have it put into words…</p><p>"You have earned the right to continue on to the next step. You have passed through the first gate. I hereby declare this stage of the Chunin Selection Examination completed. There's nothing left but to wish you all good luck."</p><p>There was a slow relaxation of tension as it sunk in that we had <em> passed</em> . A low mutter started as people shifted and shuffled and celebrated. Of course, Naruto didn't celebrate <em> quietly</em> .</p><p>My chakra sense pinged, and my hand dropped to my kunai holster even before the window shattered. Canvas fluttered, then unfurled as kunai unerringly pinned the corners to the roof and floor.</p><p>"Head's up, boys and girls, this is no time to be celebrating! I'll be your next proctor, Anko Mitarashi. You ready for the next test? Good! Then lets go, follow me!"</p><p>I relaxed, hand dropping away from my weapons as I saw who it was. Anko Mitarashi. Special Jounin. Once apprentice to Orochimaru. And, apparently, proctor for the Second Exam.</p><p>"How many are there, Ibiki?" Anko asked. "You let all these guys pass? Your test was too easy; you must be getting soft. Before I'm done with them, more than half will be eliminated," she said confidently before turning back to us.</p><p>By the very nature of the second test, only half the teams <em> could </em> pass, and even that wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>"Alright, you maggots have had it easy, but things will be different starting first thing in the morning. Meet me at Training Ground 44. Dismissed!"</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Second: Chapter 20</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: A few people have asked this so I might as well put it here; there probably wont be any romance until much later on. They are twelve, after all.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 20</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Expect the best, plan for the worst, and prepare to be surprised.~ Denis Waitley</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning dawned bright and clear as most Konoha mornings do. That was good; taking the test in the rain would have added an unneeded misery bonus that might have just pushed me off the edge.</p><p>I was twitchy in a way that was completely clear headed and focused. Because when it came down to it, us surviving Orochimaru was up to him. Him and luck.</p><p>There was no way I could stand against him. Hell, the three of us couldn't even touch Kakashi, and when those two had met, Kakashi with chidori already going <em> hadn't even registered as a threat.</em> That was how outclassed we were. There was no way I could stop him marking Sasuke if he was determined to do that.</p><p>And if there was nothing we could do, then the only thing to do would be to complete the test as fast and painlessly as possible.</p><p>"What the hell is this place?" Naruto muttered, as we gathered in the clearing outside the Training Field. There was a little booth to the side where several of yesterdays sentinels were sitting, and a sunlit clearing big enough for us all to gather. The Training Field itself was surrounded by a wire fence, plastered with all kinds of warning notices. Inside, it was like a different world. The very sun we were basking in, simply didn't reach it. The trees were overgrown and twisted and it even <em> looked</em> dank.</p><p>"This is the location for the second phase of the exam. It's Training Ground 44, but we call it… the Forest of Death.," Anko said, smiling.</p><p>Anko Mitarashi was one of those people who, I suspected, had a reputation that was completely blown out of proportion. She had a … bombastic personality, that much we'd already seen with her entrance yesterday.</p><p>Actually, I was surprised she and Naruto didn't get on better, considering that. <em> And </em> she was wearing an orange skirt.</p><p>Regardless, she had a reputation for 'crazy'.</p><p>"Forest of Death. Pff. Do your worst!" Naruto shouted. "You're not going to scare me away! I can handle anything!"</p><p>"So… looks like we've got ourselves a tough guy." She twisted, palming a kunai and launching it towards Naruto. It scrapped past his cheek, impaling itself in the ground. She vanished in a burst of Body Flicker speed.</p><p>"Are you tough enough to handle this? You're not afraid are you?" her voice was only a whisper, as she reappeared behind him. "Tough guys like you usually leave their blood all over this forest." She touched the leaking cut on his cheek. It was a thin slice, nothing worse than a cat scratch.</p><p>Naruto looked a little freaked out, but mostly just surprised.</p><p>One of the Grass ninja moved behind her. I wasn't at the right angle to see, but it looked like she had palmed another kunai to defend with.</p><p>"I was… just returning your knife," the Hidden Grass ninja said, extending an obscenely long purple tongue. I narrowed my eyes. Was that…</p><p>Had he disguised himself as a Genin? Or was it coincidence? Stretching limbs <em> had</em> been one of his techniques, hadn't it?</p><p>Yes. It was listed in the Bingo Book. The Soft Physique Modification Technique. It wasn't an <em> unknown</em> technique. There were probably many people that could use it.</p><p>His, her?, chakra was strangely subdued. Hidden. I made a note of it just in case.</p><p>"Why, thank you Grass-nin." Anko said tightly, taking the kunai back. "You know, I only recommend you stand this close behind me if you wish to reach a premature end."</p><p>She was still smiling, like the threat meant nothing to her, but there was tension in the set of her shoulders. With Naruto in front of her, and the Grass-nin behind, she was almost trapped, if poorly.</p><p>But the fact that her first instinct had been to defend, rather than to move and abandon Naruto… that won her points with me.</p><p>"My pardon. With the sight of blood on your blade slicing through my hair, I'm afraid I became a little excited. I meant you no harm," the Grass ninja said, voice syrupy. The implication that a <em> Genin</em> could have hurt her was ludicrous.</p><p>But Anko was losing the respect of the crowd, and she probably knew it. The whole point of attacking Naruto would have been to gain fear, since he'd been the one expressing confidence.</p><p>"Seems like everyone here today is quick tempered. There must be something in the air," she said blandly, moving back to the front of the group where we could all see her. It looked like she was changing tactics.</p><p>"Now before we begin this test, I have something to hand out to you all. It's just a standard consent form. Before the test, all of you are going to have to read over this form and then sign it," she said, holding up a thick stack of papers.</p><p>"What for?" Naruto asked, puzzled.</p><p>"Some of you may not come back from this test. And I have to get your consent for that risk. Otherwise it would be my responsibility." She chuckled like the concept was ridiculous.</p><p>It was all mental games. The Chunin Exams was like a mission. Once you accepted it, it was up to you to make sure you survived. There were no such things as 'consent forms'. She was just working us up, reminding us of the dangers, the same way Ibiki had. That, and probably using them to create a list of who was participating.</p><p>"Now, I'll explain what you'll be doing on this test. The first thing you need to know is that this test will tax every one of your survival skills. First, I'll give you all a description of the terrain on the practice field."</p><p>She unrolled a map. From this distance, I could barely make out the large features of the arena. I nudged Sasuke. "Eyes!" I hissed, hoping he'd get the hint and activate his Sharingan to memorise it. Having a copy of a map could <em> never</em> hurt.</p><p>"The 44th Training Ground has 44 locked entrance gates. There are rivers and a forest inside. In the centre is a locked tower, located 10km from each gate."</p><p>Shit, It was 20 kilometres across? That meant that the Training Ground covered over 300 square kilometres. That was ridiculously huge. The chances of <em> randomly</em> stumbling across other teams was pretty much nil. I'd known it was a <em> big</em> area, just not how big.</p><p>"You'll be fighting to get both a Heaven Scroll and an Earth Scroll," Anko said, holding up both as an example. They weren't large scrolls, about a hands length and about the width of a circled finger and thumb. They'd be easy to hide. "Altogether 26 teams will be taking part in this test, so half of those teams will be going after the Heaven Scroll and the other half will be trying to get the Earth Scroll. I'll hand over one kind of scroll to each team and that's what you'll be fighting for."</p><p>"Okay," Sasuke asked. "So how do we pass the test?"</p><p>"Your entire squad must bring both a Heaven and Earth Scroll to the central tower within five days."</p><p>"Completely surrounded by enemies, we wont have time to rest. We'll have to keep a constant watch," Sasuke said, eyes narrowed as he considered what this was going to be like.</p><p>"Right," Anko nodded, looking happy at the observation. "This test also measures endurance behind enemy lines. This is designed to be a gruelling test, and I'm sure some of you wont be up to the challenge."</p><p>"So… lets say, mid exam, can we just quit?" Shikamaru asked hopefully. It sounded cowardly, but knowing escape routes or rescue points was one of the first things we were taught to consider before entering unknown territory.</p><p>"Of course not. In the middle of a battle you can't just <em> quit</em> . Well, I guess you could but it's probably going to get you killed." She shrugged. "There are also some ways you can get disqualified. First, if all three members cant make it to the tower with both scrolls. Second, if a team loses a member or a member become incapacitated and cannot continue. But most importantly, none of you, absolutely <em> none of you</em> , may look at the contents of the scroll until you reach the tower."</p><p>"What if it just happens to flap open and you read it?" Naruto asked. Already, I could feel him itching to have a look at the scroll. Nothing was more tempting than being forbidden.</p><p>Given that the purpose of the last test had been for us to cheat, I half contemplated if this was the same kind of order. Except this was expressive denial where that had just punished you for getting caught.</p><p>So no, disobeying orders in this situation would not be a good thing.</p><p>"Let me put it this way, young man. You. Don't. Want. To. Know." Anko smiled. "There are times when a ninja will be asked to carry secret documents. The scroll rule is to test your integrity. Okay, we're done. Each team, take your consent forms and exchange them over there for your scrolls." She pointed at the booth. "After that, you'll be taken to a gate and the Exam can start."</p><p>The candidates all dispersed out across the clearing so that we could fill out our forms and discuss things with our team mates in peace. For a second, it looked like Naruto was going to wander off on his own, so I grabbed both the boys and dragged them to the side so that we were in the trees around the clearing.</p><p>It wasn't thick cover, but it would have to do.</p><p>I quickly read over the form and scribbled my name on it before turning to the boys.</p><p>"They're putting a curtain up over the booth," I murmured. There was no one close by, but it was best not to take chances.</p><p>"I see how it is," Sasuke said. "We wont know which team has which scroll, and we wont know which member is carrying the scroll. It's just like Ibiki said, stealing information is really a matter of life or death…"</p><p>He looked down at his form, lost in thought.</p><p>"What are you guys talking about?" Naruto asked, looking from one of us to the other.</p><p>"We have to come up with a plan," I explained. "We need to find a way to know which team has what scroll and where they are in the Training Field. Otherwise, we could be wandering around for the whole five days and not find anything…" Well, other than whoever found us, and I would really rather be the ambusher than ambushee.</p><p>"Well… we could just watch them get the scrolls?" Naruto suggested.</p><p>Sasuke shook his head. "The Chunin wont let us. Look at them, the booth is set up so that no one can peek inside it."</p><p>"… unless…" I said slowly, my hands forming a circle. "Naruto… can your clones Transform into say… spiders? Little ones?"</p><p>Naruto scratched the back of his head. "Uh, sure, I guess. Why?"</p><p>I was silent a second longer, plotting it all out. "Okay, here's what you're going to do. You're going to create 26 clones here, without anyone noticing, either as spiders or then have them use the Transformation Jutsu to become spiders, or some other small insect. Then those spiders are going to go and <em> carefully</em> climb on one member of each team without them noticing. They're going to see what scroll each team gets, where they hide it and what gate they go to. Then, once they're at the gates, they are going to <em> secretly</em> create a clone that can dispel to give you that information. Once we've decided what team we're going to go after, we can use the clones to get updated information. You should try your hardest to not get noticed, okay?"</p><p>Naruto stared at me for a second, then tucked his hands behind his head grinning like mad. "This is going to be so awesome! They'll never know what hit them!"</p><p>Sasuke smirked. "We're going to <em> ace</em> this test."</p><p>I half smiled back at them. I could feel Naruto's chakra fluctuating and splitting, but there were no telltale puffs of chakra and I barely caught glimpses of orange from the corners of my eyes before they were gone. It looked like he was putting the plan into action already and that Sensei's stealth training might have more use than I thought.</p><p>"Did you see the map she showed us?" I asked Sasuke. "Do you think you could redraw it?" I got a pencil and empty scroll out of my missions bag. It looked like our team was one of the few who had thought to bring them.</p><p>He nodded, taking the items. "It was a pretty basic map," he said. "I don't think it will help us much."</p><p>I shrugged philosophically. "Anything is better than nothing."</p><p>"Alright, everyone, we're going to start handing out scrolls now," the Chunin announced from the booth. They'd given us a suspiciously long time to fill out a basic form, so I figured we were expected to be plotting and otherwise getting ready.</p><p>We weren't in a hurry to get our scroll, waiting till almost everyone else had gone. I'd seen a few unknown passengers on people's clothes and hoped that Naruto was getting some decent information.</p><p>The Chunin looked pretty bored as they flicked through our paperwork. We were nearly the last team in.</p><p>"Okay, here's your scroll," he said, handing us a white wrapped scroll. Heaven, then, and we needed Earth.</p><p>Sasuke took it and weighed it in his hand for a second, before handing it to me. I blinked at him in surprise and he nodded.</p><p><em> Well, then.</em> I opened my jacket and tucked it into the inside pocket before zipping it back up. I was less likely to lose my jacket than my backpack, so it should be safer there. And it would be pretty much impossible to steal without me noticing.</p><p>"Listen up!" Anko shouted once the team behind us was done. "All the teams have received their scrolls, so everybody go to your gate and wait there. When the gates open, the test is on!"</p><p>It was half past two by the time the gates were open. That gave us maybe five hours of sunlight left, maybe less, given how dark the forest already seemed.</p><p>"What are the nearest Genin teams?" I asked Naruto.</p><p>He scratched the back of his head. "Well… there was an older Konoha team right next to us, I don't know them but they have Heaven as well."</p><p>"Just focus on the ones with Earth, for now," Sasuke cut in.</p><p>Naruto nodded. "Uh, well, there's the Rain team with the, y'know, white jumpsuits. They've got Earth. There's a team from Sound and that team from Grass with the crazy tongue lady as well. They've both got Earth, I think, but it sounded like they were looking for someone already."</p><p>What to do, attack or run? Attack or run?</p><p>We could take on the Sound team, which would mean they couldn't fight us later when we were weakened… but they'd be tricky opponents and could leave us injured. Now was a bad time to be vulnerable.</p><p>We could attack the Grass team…</p><p>Everything in me balked at the very idea.</p><p>If it was Orochimaru… if it was…</p><p>We might not be able to escape, but that didn't mean we had to willingly throw ourselves into the snake pit.</p><p>If we went for the Rain team, got ourselves a scroll and hightailed it for the tower…</p><p>"The Rain team," I said. "If we stick to the trees and use Sensei's lessons, we could probably set up an ambush. Naruto can get an update from his clone when we're closer, and if we scout out the location a bit…"</p><p>Sasuke considered it, then nodded. "Alright. Naruto, lead the way."</p><p>"Leave it to me!" Naruto assured, jumping up into the twisted branches of the trees.</p><p>We followed. "Don't forget to keep an eye out for traps and natural hazards," I reminded. This place was literally crawling with dangerous wildlife.</p><p>The Rain team had been two gates away from us, so it didn't take us long to get there at all. We halted in the trees at their last known location, scanning our surroundings.</p><p>"Okay, Naruto," Sasuke said. "Get us an update."</p><p>"Right!" Naruto formed a cross seal and a Shadow Clone popped briefly into existence. There was a seconds pause as he waited for his other clone to respond back. "Uh, they've split up at the moment to find other teams. My clone isn't on the one with the scroll, so I don't know where it is…"</p><p>He looked disheartened at that.</p><p>"Where are they planning on meeting?" I asked. If they'd split up, they had to have a meeting point planned.</p><p>"Further up ahead," Naruto answered. "They marked it, so it should be pretty easy to find."</p><p>"Good," Sasuke said, satisfied. "We find it, and we ambush them when they come back."</p><p>"Did you see or hear any of their plans or attacks?" I asked. "Anything about how they might fight?"</p><p>"They <em> did</em> say they were going to head closer to the tower if they couldn't find anyone here…" Naruto said slowly. "I don't know if that helps."</p><p>I nodded. "Everyone is going to have to head to the tower at some point. So, if you didn't have a scroll, you could trap a team that had either one or both. But it would require a lot of patience, and most people probably wont start heading that way till day three unless they've already got both scrolls."</p><p>"And if you get both scrolls before then," Sasuke finished. "You're probably strong enough to defeat an ambush."</p><p>"Right," I confirmed. "But if they're planning on setting traps, they'll probably be able to spot anything we do. Keep it basic?"</p><p>"Drop and grab?" Sasuke suggested. "They'll probably stick to the ground, so if we drop out of the trees and take them by surprise… You can grab them with your Shadow Possession and Naruto and I will knock them out."</p><p>I nodded. "Sounds good to me. I'll give you guys some knockout tags this time." I really did love knockout tags. They were so handy. The only downside was that you had to physically apply them to the enemy before you could activate them; they didn't have a radius like explosive notes.</p><p>Naruto scowled. "That wasn't our fault! Stupid sticky web chakra thing!"</p><p>We took up position high in the trees above the designated meeting spot. The three of us triangulated the area, able to see each other and hopefully cover the entire space. It was the same as any other watch duty we'd ever done, but more difficult because there were far more dangers to watch out for. At one point, three tigers prowled beneath us for a while, which was strange since tigers are generally solitary animals. They were huge animals, easily taller at the shoulder than a full grown human.</p><p>There were other animals, too, that we had to keep an eye out for. A flock of birds burst through the leaves at one point and I caught a glimpse of vicious looking beaks and talons. There were all manner of giant insects, and I had to move branches at one point because an oversize tarantula decided it wanted my spot. I squashed the desire to kill it as a potential give away but I had no idea if it was poisonous and I wasn't about to find out.</p><p>Also, giant spider.</p><p>I was a girl. I was allowed to freak out.</p><p>At three hours into the Second Exam, the rasping of rebreathers below us alerted us to the return of the Rain Genin. They were all fairly identical looking, with white suits, wild brown hair, rebreathers and bandages around their eyes. The only differentiation was how many eyes they had visible. Zero, One or Two.</p><p><em> Potential sensor type,</em> I signed carefully to my team mates. They nodded in comprehension. A shinobi working blind had to have some sort of powerful offset ability, usually either hearing or chakra sense. <em> Trap potentially identified.</em></p><p>"No luck," One said. "The rookies are long gone."</p><p>"Such a shame," Two said. "They were bound to be the easiest targets. Now we'll have to work for it."</p><p>"I wouldn't be so sure of that," Zero commented, chuckling. "It seems we've got company. Why don't you come down here, kiddies?"</p><p>Yeah, they noticed us. We communicated with a quick look, then dropped down to the ground. We didn't regroup, maintaining our triangular formation to surround them.</p><p>"Who are you calling 'easy targets'?" Naruto demanded. "We're here to kick your ass and take your scroll!"</p><p>Naruto was good at attracting attention, which gave me plenty of opportunity to catch them out in my shadow. Or it would have, normally.</p><p>"Mubi! Oboro! Look out!" Zero shouted, darting backwards up a tree trunk as my shadow tried to snare him. Seemed he'd noticed me. Right. Sensor type.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete!" I said, catching the other two who hadn't been quite as fast. "Pin them, quick!"</p><p>Sasuke darted forward, slapping a knockout tag on each of them. They sagged in my jutsu and I released it to let them fall to the floor. It would be best to tie them up as well, but even if the tag was removed they wouldn't wake for ten minutes.</p><p>"He's the one with the scroll!" Naruto shouted, darting after the fleeing Zero.</p><p><em> Typical.</em></p><p>Sasuke darted up a separated tree trunk, trying to cut him off. I hurled a brace of shuriken and a kunai with explosive note attached in order to direct him back towards my team mates.</p><p>He was fast, I'd give him that. But so were we.</p><p>I cut left, throwing another brace of kunai. Zero dodged away, circling to keep a tree trunk between him and me.</p><p>And then Sasuke was there, opening with a flying kick straight to his face. Zero catapulted backwards, Sasuke following him like glue, raining down brutal punches. It was damn easy to see how overpowered Zero was. Taijutsu was obviously not his forte.</p><p>He desperately tried to pull back and disengage but didn't get a chance until Sasuke's roundhouse kick sent him flying back down to the ground. His chakra fuzzed, but he recovered, even as we leapt down to the ground after him.</p><p>"Haze Clone Jutsu!"</p><p>Wispy projections started to rise out of the earth. I barely felt it as Zero slipped underground, but I did feel it. Some variation of the Earth Walking Technique, then. I concentrated on keeping track of him and preparing my jutsu, trusting my team mates to keep watch.</p><p>"Clones?" Naruto said. "I got this! Shadow Clone Jutsu."</p><p>The clearing was suddenly full of <em> orange</em> .</p><p>Then a dozen shouts of 'Huh?' and 'What the hell?' and 'I just went straight through him!'</p><p>"Illusions," Sasuke said, eyes flicking back and forth.</p><p>But I was finally ready.</p><p>"Earth Release: Earth Walking Jutsu!" I sank both arms into the ground, grabbed and <em> pulled.</em> He fought, twisting and kicking. I had grabbed an ankle, apparently, which wasn't the most secure hold. His jutsu was more advanced then mine, giving him a much greater force and range of motion underground.</p><p>Regardless, I stuck my feet to the ground and heaved, and he slid out of the dirt, kunai poised to stab me. I couldn't block unless I let go. He was using double sided Rain issue kunai that had a second blade instead of a ring attached to the handle. The blades were slightly smaller than Konoha standard kunai but still enough to do me some serious damage.</p><p>I didn't let go.</p><p>Sasuke had his Sharingan active. There were a dozen Naruto's in the clearing. He was disarmed and pinned down before I even fully had him out of the ground.</p><p>"Got him," Sasuke said, sticking the knockout tag on him.</p><p>I panted. "Scroll?"</p><p>"Got <em> it!</em> " Naruto sing songed, holding up the item in question.</p><p>I smiled in relief.</p><p>"Now what do we do with them?" Sasuke asked, staring at the unconscious body in front of him. I could tell he was thinking the same things I was.</p><p>"Tie them up. We don't want them coming back after us," I said, absently wiping my now very dirty hands on my pants. "We could even net them, which will at least protect them from most of the animals…"</p><p>Because even if they were the enemy, I didn't particularly want to leave them tied up and helpless in such a dangerous place.</p><p>"If we were closer to the fence I'd suggest throwing them over it," I said.</p><p>Sasuke considered and shook his head. "Too far. Let's get back to the others before they wake." He used ninja wire to tie Zero's hands and feet together, taking care to bind the fingers in a professional manner to prevent hand seals.</p><p>The other two hadn't woken yet, which was good, since I didn't really want to go to the effort of fighting them. We tied them up the same, and then bundled them in a net trap and hung if from a tree branch like some weird piñata.</p><p>It was the best we could do for them.</p><p>"Who's taking the scroll?" Naruto asked, when we were done. He was fidgeting it between his hands.</p><p>Sasuke and I looked at each other. It wouldn't be a good idea to give it to me, since I already had one, so the choice was between Naruto and Sasuke.</p><p>"Does your jacket have an inside pocket?" I asked.</p><p>"Huh? Uh… I think so." He unzipped his jacket to check. Most ninja clothing had an excess of pockets. We liked pockets. They were handy. "Yeah, right here!"</p><p>"Okay. Put it in there," Sasuke ordered. "And don't take your jacket off for anything."</p><p>Naruto blinked.</p><p>"And don't hand the scroll over to anyone. Not even me or Sasuke," I added, aware that people would probably try to impersonate us.</p><p>"You… want me to keep it?" he asked slowly. A little disbelieving.</p><p>"What? You don't think you can handle it?" Sasuke asked, tauntingly.</p><p>"You just watch, Sasuke! This will be the safest scroll in the entire forest! Believe it!" Naruto shouted, pointing his finger at Sasuke.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "Just … try not to announce that you have it, or anything," I suggested. "Or people will target you."</p><p>"Oh, right," he said sheepishly.</p><p>"Right. Scroll sorted. Now do we head for the tower or find a place to hunker down for the night?" I asked. Personally, I wanted to head for the tower and it's assumed safety, but I wasn't sure we'd make it. Being caught out at night would be much worse.</p><p>It'd probably take us two hours to cover the ground between here and the tower, and that was at top speed without running into <em> anything</em> . Pushing that fast would leave us weakened if we were attacked and so would be dangerous. On the other hand, moving any slower wouldn't get us there before night fell.</p><p>"Find a place to make camp," Sasuke said. "It'd be too dangerous to keep moving once the light fades."</p><p>It was the right decision to make.</p><p>Yet at the same time…</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

You must do the thing which you think you cannot do. ~Eleanor Roosevelt</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"The river is to the right of here," Sasuke said, spreading the map out and tracing it with his finger. "We should try and avoid getting too close to it. Everyone is going to go there, both for a landmark and for water."</p><p>"Not just every <em> one</em> ," I murmured. "Animals need water too."</p><p>"Right. We should stay clear of it for now. We need to look for something with cover, something we can put our backs too. And preferably something that isn't already inhabited." His lips twisted grimly.</p><p>Yeah, I didn't want to fight a bear for a cave either.</p><p>"We should -" I froze, cutting off what I was saying, my head up and scanning like a startled deer.</p><p>"What? Do you see something?" Sasuke asked, uneasily.</p><p>A splinter of flying wood caught Naruto across the cheek. He touched his cheek, startled. "Huh? What was that?" He looked in the direction it came from. There was nothing there.</p><p>But there was a huge <em> surge</em> of incoming chakra.</p><p>"Move!" I screamed, leaping to the side.</p><p>We scattered.</p><p>Gale force winds ripped through the trees where we had just been standing. They were fairly tightly controlled, like a cone of wind blasting from a single point.</p><p><em> Jutsu,</em> my mind categorised.<em> Wind Release, A-rank or above.</em> The amount of destruction it caused meant it could be ranked no less.</p><p><em> This is it. This is how it starts</em> .</p><p>When the wind and the dust and the debris cleared, a woman's voice spoke up.</p><p>"Alright, you two fan out into the woods and keep your eyes open. I'll handle this alone."</p><p><em> Blocking our escape routes</em> . But whoever they were, whatever rank they were, they would be less dangerous than what was waiting for us here.</p><p>I swallowed.</p><p>We had to regroup.</p><p>Sasuke was on the other side of the newly created trench. Naruto was much further away. He must have been caught in the blast as we jumped. I hoped he wasn't hurt. But Naruto could take care of himself. Right now, it was <em> us</em> I was worried about.</p><p>I scampered up a tree trunk, twisting around it yet trying to keep an eye on the woman standing unconcerned in the clearing. It was the Grass-nin. The one that I had thought could be Orochimaru.</p><p><em> She must be.</em></p><p>No true Genin could harness that level of destruction.</p><p>I moved, circling round, up over the bare destroyed ground, to meet up with Sasuke.</p><p>"Sasuke?" I asked, landing lightly behind him.</p><p>"What <em> was</em> that?" he breathed, eyes wide.</p><p>"Danger," I said, sombrely, barely keeping the tremors out of my voice. "We need to move."</p><p>He stared at me, then nodded. "We need to find Naruto. I think he got caught in it."</p><p>"Hey, what's up, are you guys okay?" A familiar voice called as an orange suited body ran up to us, panting. That chakra… that hidden, muted chakra…</p><p>"Wait," I said, holding up my hand. "ID check." I could sense chakra and my team mates knew it. So the fact that I was even asking sent warning bells ringing through Sasuke's mind. "Those who abandon the rules are…" I gestured at Sasuke.</p><p>He caught on in a flash. "Trash but those who abandon…"</p><p>'Naruto' looked at us cluelessly. "Huh? What are you guys talking about? We didn't agree to any passwords or anything."</p><p>Sasuke's kunai sailed towards him, just as my shadow lashed across the ground underneath it.</p><p>'Naruto' dodged nimbly, in a way the real Naruto couldn't have.</p><p>"Come out, whoever you are," Sasuke ordered. "Party's over."</p><p>'Naruto's face curled into a smirk that didn't sit right. It looked wrong. Naruto's face was made for grinning not sly, smug smirks. "Aren't we the clever one." The Transformation Jutsu dispelled violently with a huge cloud of chakra smoke. It was that same Grass-nin, who, I was now sure, was also Orochimaru. "This promises to be <em> very</em> entertaining."</p><p>"You've made a mistake, attacking us," Sasuke said coolly.</p><p>"Oh, I don't think so, Sasuke Uchiha." The name was drawn out, each syllable pronounced separately. "I've heard so much about you that I just <em> had</em> to see it for myself."</p><p>"Now you've seen me," Sasuke said impassively. "You can be on your way."</p><p>Orochimaru <em> chuckled</em> . It wasn't loud but the sound carried in a way that wasn't natural at all. "So tense. Don't you want to get your hands on our Earth Scroll? It would go so nicely with your Heaven Scroll." The darkly covered scroll dangled from his fingers before a long tongue snaked out and he <em> swallowed</em> it.</p><p>"We don't require an Earth Scroll," Sasuke said flatly. "So you can just be on your way."</p><p>After the massive wind jutsu, I think he knew this was a fight we didn't want to be getting into.</p><p>"Ah, you have been busy. Already gaining yourself an Earth Scroll. That is impressive. Well, it doesn't matter. When this is over, one of us will have the scrolls, and the other will be <em> dead</em> ."</p><p>There is no way to describe how that Killing Intent felt. Zabuza had been bad, but we had had Kakashi-sensei with us. And we had <em> trusted</em> him to keep us safe. This was… this was so far beyond that. It was knowing you were outclassed beyond your wildest dreams. It was facing an opponent who regarded you as little more than a bug. It was killing intent you would commit suicide to escape.</p><p>It was so thick and potent in the air it felt physical. It was like cement blocks around my feet. Like weights tied to my neck. It choked in my throat like rotting meat every time I tried to breathe. It burned my skin, rough and angry chakra that <em> hated</em> so badly.</p><p>It was painful. It was ugly. My heart thudded an erratic beat. I could see my death second by second, painted on the underside of my eyelids, etched into my brain as it approached and I. could. not. escape.</p><p><em> But,</em> a tiny, cynical portion of my brain whispered, <em> it's not as bad as Kyuubi</em> .</p><p>Sasuke retched. He was shaking, shivering just as badly as I. Maybe worse, maybe better, I couldn't tell, my attention was too focused forward. Tunnel vision.</p><p>Orochimaru laughed, mockingly. "You're paralysed with fear. Prey in the gaze of a predator. How amusing."</p><p>Sasuke staggered to his feet, clutching a kunai shakily in his hand.</p><p>"Very good," Orochimaru said approvingly, voice aggravatingly calm. How could he project such bloodlust and still act so indifferent? "Now what happens?"</p><p>The Killing Intent doubled.</p><p>The air pulsed, like we were inside a beating heart.</p><p>I was drowning… I couldn't <em> breathe…</em></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll make it quick. But I don't have to tell you that, do I?" There were footsteps. The sound of kunai scraping against the side of a holster. "You've seen it with your own eyes."</p><p>It was impossible… there was nothing I could do…</p><p>We were going to die.</p><p>… <em> might seem suicidal…</em></p><p>…<em> focus on the goal</em> …</p><p>The goal. To survive.</p><p>The barest of dreams, of ambitions. <em> Survive.</em></p><p>I needed to act. Somehow… anyhow. Right now, anything would be better than nothing.</p><p>I glanced at Sasuke. Sometimes I forgot, because my body was young but my mind was older.</p><p>Sasuke was a twelve year old boy.</p><p>However mature he was, however traumatised, however much a child soldier… underneath it all he was a twelve year old boy.</p><p>And he was frightened out of his mind.</p><p>"I expected you to be more of a challenge. How disappointing."</p><p><em> No.</em></p><p>Then. Again.</p><p><em> No. This is not the way things are going to be.</em></p><p>That thought gave me strength. Twisted, desperate strength. I was a cornered animal. Frightened and feral. And defending my team mate.</p><p>I <em> snarled.</em></p><p>I pumped myself up on chakra, gaining courage from the familiar rush of energy, and flew forward, full speed, full strength.</p><p>Not the smartest course of action. Not the best course of action. But it was something and <em> determination</em> helped squash the fear down deep where it belonged.</p><p>I threw a pair of kunai, deflecting those that had been aimed at us, and lunged forward underneath them, sweeping around in a roundhouse kick. He bent, <em> bent</em> , out of the way and swatted me, casually, like a fly to the side. It wasn't even a proper strike, just a careless backhand wave that caught me square in the ribs.</p><p>My chakra spiked, absorbing the force of the blow, but breaking my enhancement. I flipped, as gracefully as I could through the air and landed, panting. The pain, sharp and brief, had cleared my head.</p><p>Attacking like this would do nothing.</p><p>"Sasuke! Move!" I barked putting as much force into my voice as I could.</p><p>No 'it's going to be alright'. No 'please, please, move'. No 'you <em> have</em> to'. Because it wasn't going to be alright. Because we didn't have <em> time</em> to plead and beg and come to terms with it.</p><p>There was only time to <em> move.</em> And he would only respond to an order.</p><p>I hurled shuriken and kunai, trying to distract Orochimaru, to provide respite for the one crucial second that it would take Sasuke to <em> move</em> . He flowed around my attacks, like they didn't matter, like I didn't even <em> exist</em> .</p><p>And still he walked forward. Inexorable.</p><p>I saw, out the corner of my eye as Sasuke stabbed his kunai into his leg, breaking the fear with pain. I caught his eye, and as one we flickered away.</p><p>"An interesting move," Orochimaru commented. "Run, little mouse. Run all you want… there is no escape."</p><p>"We need to get out of here," Sasuke panted, as we crouched in the bend of a tree branch.</p><p>I nodded reverently, cold sweat covering all my skin. "We run - Sasuke! Look out!" I shoved him in one direction, leaping in the other as a snake - a giant freaking snake! - crashed a head the size of a car through the place we had been standing.</p><p>"Unbelievable. I didn't even notice. I'm losing it," he muttered, eyes wide as he landed awkwardly, swinging around a thin tree limb.</p><p>It wound around the branches, limber and at ease for such a large creature. It lunged for Sasuke again, mouth open wide, fangs gleaming. I cursed myself for being out of position - for being unable to <em> help</em> .</p><p>"No! Stay away!" His voice was rich with panic, even as he threw shuriken; some of them must have hit for it reeled backwards collapsing and bleeding on a branch.</p><p>And then it's skin began to ripple and crack. Horrifyingly, sickeningly, a pale body began to climb from the corpse.</p><p>"I sense your fear and desperation. It's only natural. The prey must never let down its guard, not even for a moment, in the presence of its predator!" He chuckled and lunged forward, body coiling and stretching like he was a snake himself.</p><p>Sasuke screamed.</p><p>And a hail of kunai impacted on the wood.</p><p>"Looks like I came just in time."</p><p><em> Naruto!</em></p><p>Our chances weren't really any better now, but I still felt lighter.</p><p>"What took you so long?" I shouted up at him. "You better not have some lame excuse about getting lost on the road of life!"</p><p>"I got eaten by a giant snake!" He shouted back. "And let me tell you, the inside smells worse than the outside!"</p><p>That was another lesson I'd learnt from Sensei - banter helps calm you down, keep you focused. Or something. Maybe it was just gallows humour.</p><p>Orochimaru was just reclining on the branch, for all the world at ease. "So, Naruto, you managed to escape from my friend. Well done."</p><p>"Okay, okay, I don't know what's going on here, but you've been picking on my friends and I don't like that. So you just better slither back into your hole before I make a pair of shoes out of you!" Naruto shouted back.</p><p>Could he not feel the Killing Intent in the air? I wondered hazily. Or did he just not care either way?</p><p>"Clones!" I shouted suddenly. "As many as you can!"</p><p>"On it!" Chorused back to me a dozen, a hundred, maybe even a thousand times over, more shimmering into existence wherever there was space.</p><p>I grabbed the one nearest me. "Transform into Sasuke and me. Then use Replacement to get us out of here. We're running." My voice was terse and concise.</p><p>It nodded and dispelled. The reaction was immediate. I felt the tugging pull of a Replacement Jutsu even as orange faded to blue and green in front of me.</p><p>There was a Sasuke and Naruto in front of me. I assumed they were the real ones. "Quickly!" I hissed, darting forwards.</p><p>"What's going on?" Naruto hissed back. "Why are we running?"</p><p>"You don't know what you're up against," Sasuke shot back, fear making his voice hoarse. "If we stay here, we'll die…"</p><p>"There's no way that person is a Genin," I finished.</p><p>Almost immediately, as if to punctuate my words, a tornado <em> ripped</em> through the air. This was ten times as violent as the first one he had thrown at us, shooting straight up into the air. The tree <em> creaked</em> and groaned, wobbling violently as it was uprooted.</p><p>"Shit," Naruto hissed. "My clones are all dispelled."</p><p>Sasuke trembled. "We have to… we have to…"</p><p>"We'll fight, if we have to fight!" Naruto barked. "Stop cowering like a frightened rabbit! This isn't you, Sasuke!" He looked like he wanted to shake him.</p><p>"We could give her the scroll," Sasuke muttered, wildly.</p><p>"I don't think he wants the scrolls, Sasuke," I said, shakily.</p><p>"Very true," a smooth voice said. "A sensible offering though. Sometimes, the helpless prey, if they are to save their own skins, must distract the predator with something even more precious." He slid around the tree, already ahead of us. "But it doesn't matter. As far as the scroll goes, I could simply kill you and take it."</p><p>He sounded like he liked that idea best, biting his thumb and smearing blood over the strange tattoos wrapped around his wrist. "Summoning Jutsu."</p><p>A huge snake, as big as the one before, if not bigger, burst into existence.</p><p>"What a tasty little meal you'll make for him. Careful, he likes to play with his food." He chuckled again, as the snake lunged forward.</p><p>Again, we scattered, helplessly caught in his game. We had no choice but to play.</p><p>I twisted, bouncing horizontally off a tree trunk, back towards the snake. I slammed an explosive tag onto it's side, adhering it with chakra and rolled off the branch, letting gravity take me down out of the explosion zone.</p><p>That was my biggest, most dangerous, tag.</p><p>I felt the heat licking my back, heard the muffled 'whump' as it went up and rolled to my feet, to see the smoke clearing.</p><p>It wasn't damaged at all.</p><p>Sick fear pooled in my stomach.</p><p>"Shadow Clone Jutsu!" Naruto called out, leaping down onto the snake, a dozen of him, all at once.</p><p>Orochimaru lashed out, a single kick that took him skywards, slamming through several branches before stopping.</p><p>Naruto <em> growled</em> .</p><p><em> Oh, god, not now,</em> I pleaded, feeling the Kyuubi's chakra rising. Torn between two fears I was stretched and going to <em> break</em> …</p><p>It wasn't much, not even as much as he'd used on the bridge, and I could still taste it on the back of my tongue, acid burning and always <em> reminding me-</em></p><p><em> Not now. Notnownotnownot…</em></p><p><em> Small and </em> helpless<em> and ohgodI'mgoingtodie…</em></p><p>"I see." I heard, as though from a great distance. I blinked, muzzily, trying to bring the world back into focus. "When your anger is roused, some of the Nine Tailed Fox's chakra is released. What an interesting childhood you must have had."</p><p>His fingertips lit up with burning purple chakra and he slammed it into Naruto's stomach. Right overtop of the seal. Not good.</p><p>Naruto's chakra went haywire, the lingering taint of Kyuubi vanishing, and he collapsed. His body draped over the branch, limp and lifeless. Was he-?</p><p>Still alive, at least. He still had chakra. But for how long?</p><p>"Who are you?" I demanded shakily. I knew, oh I knew, but he had to say it. "What do you want?"</p><p>He half turned, as though I wasn't worthy of his full attention. "My name is Orochimaru. But as for what I want…" his lips curved into a cruel smirk and his attention refocused on Sasuke. "That is for later." He chuckled.</p><p>Sasuke was still staring at him in abject terror.</p><p>"Now then, lets see how well <em> you</em> do, Sasuke."</p><p>Casually, like it took no effort at all, he blew across his fingers. Fire gusted out, racing towards Sasuke. It was four, five, maybe ten times as big as any Sasuke had ever created.</p><p><em> Shit. Fire Jutsu. No seals.</em></p><p>And Sasuke wasn't moving.</p><p>I took a page out of Naruto's book and used the Replacement Jutsu on Sasuke. It took a huge chunk of chakra, more than I expected, and I stumbled on landing, barely having time to leap high into the air. I could feel the heat of the fireball beneath me, as I twisted to throw kunai at it's creator.</p><p>"Lightning Release: Striking Bolt!" The Jutsu tore from me, lighting up the air between us. It was the strongest attack Jutsu I had ever created.</p><p>And he deflected it aside with his naked hand.</p><p>"You… are beginning to become annoying," he spoke, for once looking at me and not Sasuke. "You're coming at me with the intent to kill. I can feel it in your chakra, little girl. That focus… is surprising. But you have a long way to go before you can land a hit on me."</p><p>And then, between one blink and the next he was gone.</p><p>Something slammed into the back of my neck, sending me toppling forward. I had enough time to come to the panicked, horrified realisation, <em> Shit, the ground is too far awa-</em></p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Second: Chapter 22</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: General consensus is that last chapters cliffhanger makes me an evil, evil person. XD So I thought I'd better get this out quick so you don't all lynch me. :P</p><p>Everyone seems to be looking forward to the rest of the fight… maybe I should do a side story of it from Sasuke's point of view?</p><p>Anyway, thanks for all the reviews, and sorry for not replying to them this time. I usually try to because if you guys take the time to review I should at least say thanks. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 22</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The greatest test of courage on earth is to bear defeat without losing heart. ~ Robert Green Ingersoll </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I woke in pain. Throbbing, aching, blinding pain. I was still lying where I'd fallen, facedown spread eagled on the dirt.</p><p><em> Naruto! Sasuke! </em></p><p>Their chakra was high above me, fluctuating in the treetops but alone. They were alive, then, but in what state?</p><p>I staggered to my feet, the entire forest blurring before my eyes. My face was on fire, my breath coming in painful whistles. Tenderly, I touched my nose, sending waves of pain radiating out. Broken, badly.</p><p>I needed to fix it. I needed to be able to breathe. Anything that impeded that…</p><p>I aligned my chakra grimly, used my good hand to grasp it and snapped it back into place.</p><p>And nearly ended up back in the dirt.</p><p>"… fuck," I hissed, as I worked on it with my chakra. I couldn't heal the cartilage, but I could fix the torn tissue that held it in place. "Fuckity fuck."</p><p>I took stock of my injuries. My thought process was broken, trailing off oddly and leaving me feeling like I was grasping at straws. Concussion, then. Not the best state of mind to be making decisions in. My left forearm ached, and I knew that one of my bones was fractured or broken. The pain of a broken bone was unmistakable to anyone who had felt it before, deep and throbbing. My hand was still usable though, as long as I didn't put weight on it, or twist too harshly. My ribs twinged; sprained, strained, fractured or broken, I didn't know. There was what felt like a gravel rash up the entire right side of my face, caked with a thick mix of dried mud and blood. Either I'd scraped it against the trees falling, or done it on the landing.</p><p>But I was alive.</p><p><em> Up, I need to go up</em> , I thought. Even tilting my head back to stare at the tree caused the world to swim, and I barely caught sight of a dark sky beyond the canopy. <em> Night-time?</em></p><p>Of course it was. It had already been late when Orochimaru attacked us. I didn't know how long I'd been out. My internal body clock had given up the ghost, curled away under the concussion. There wasn't enough sky to see the patterns of the stars but it was fairly bright still, implying that the moon was out. I could only hope it hadn't been too long.</p><p>I wobbled towards the tree trunk, nausea rising with every step. Thankfully, thankfully, my chakra responded even though it was advised not to use it with a concussion. I didn't have many options here.</p><p>I crawled more than walked up to where the boys were, having to break to press myself flat against the trunk and pant through the nausea and pain more than once. It took too long to get up there, and I knew that I damn well couldn't climb it again.</p><p><em> Right</em> , I thought, closing my eyes for a second. Just a second…</p><p><em> No!</em> My head jerked back up, eyes snapping open. <em> Focus. You can't sleep yet.</em></p><p>It took a while for my brain to compute what my eyes were telling it. The lingering chakra from battle was apparent to my senses, but muddled by the time it reached my brain.</p><p>I felt like a clockwork toy that needed rewinding, slowly fizzling out of energy before juddering to a halt.</p><p><em> It looks like someone took a chainsaw and a flamethrower to the trees</em> …</p><p>Smeared scorch marks, broken branches, and something had punched a hole right through the middle of a trunk. There were kunai and shuriken littered everywhere. There were snapped strands of ninja wire dangling in the breeze… This was no small amount of destruction.</p><p>I shook off my musing and crawled forwards, carefully placing every hand and knee, distrusting my own innate sense of balance.</p><p>"Sasuke?" my voice wobbled as I shook his shoulder. He was remarkably uninjured, only minor scratches and bruises. But he was pale and sweating and <em> gasping</em> for air like a dying man.</p><p>And his neck…</p><p>I closed my eyes in despair.</p><p><em> The curse mark…</em></p><p>This close, I could feel it. The dank, dark, vile chakra intruding on his system.</p><p>"Damn it. Goddamn it," I swore with feeling.</p><p>I wished there was something I could do. I wished I wasn't so small and helpless and <em> stupid</em> . If I was smarter we could have avoided this. If I was better, I could help him…</p><p>Tears pricked my eyes.</p><p>"Okay," I said shakily, talking out loud like they could hear me. "Okay. We can't stay up here. One of us is going to fall… I can't… I can't carry you down." I'd barely made it up. There was no way I'd make it down and then be able to repeat the trip with the other. "I … I have rope? Yes…"</p><p>I fumbled with my backpack, careful, careful not to drop it. If I lost it now, I'd never be able to get it back. Inside was my sealing scroll, and I unfurled it, looking for the mark I needed. In the dark it was hard, and the kanji all blurred in front of my concussed, watery eyes. Finally, I located the seal and with a press of chakra, had a long coil of rope at hand. I rolled the scroll and secured it back in my bag, swinging it back up on my back trying not to jar either my arm or ribs.</p><p>Tying a loop of rope around the tree branch was a slow, agonising process. I had to get the end of the rope around the tree branch larger than the reach of my arms. In the end, I tied it to the end of a kunai, and used the weight of it to swing around. I nearly sliced my hand off when I fumbled the catch.</p><p>Then, I didn't trust the kunai wedged into the wood to hold the weight of a person, so I had to untie the knot and go through the complicated process of retying it mostly one handed, with limited coordination, but securely enough that it wouldn't come undone.</p><p>"Right." I exhaled. "Now to tie the other end to Sasuke."</p><p>I grimaced and wiggled forwards, clumsily working the rope around him in a crude harness. I tied it off, and tested the knot, making as sure as I could that it wouldn't come undone.</p><p>"Okay. Here goes nothing," I said, looping the rope around a sideways branch and using my chakra help gain purchase on both the tree and rope. Slowly, ever so slowly, I began to lower him down to the ground. He flopped in the harness, hanging awkwardly limp in a way that made it clear he wasn't well.</p><p>Even through my gloves, I could feel the heat of friction as I let the rope out. My left arm throbbed and ached, even as I tried to take most of the weight with my other arm. Then suddenly, the tension of the rope relaxed. I peered over the side of the branch, sagging with relief to see Sasuke lying on the ground, not caught on something on the way. I wasn't sure how I'd fix something like that.</p><p>"Now to do it all over again," I said, sighing. Then I paused, and eyed Naruto in trepidation. He was limp, lying on a branch exactly where Orochimaru had left him, yes, but it was a branch on a whole 'nother tree entirely.</p><p>In normal conditions, the gap would have meant nothing to me. I could have covered it just as easily as crossing open ground.</p><p>Now, I looked at the distance and didn't know if I'd make it.</p><p><em> Can't stay here</em> , I repeated, and jumped.</p><p>The wood smacked into my feet harshly, sooner than I expected. I stumbled, and would have gone straight on over without the judicious use of chakra to keep me steady.</p><p>I breathed out, shakily, feeling my ribs complain at the sudden landing.</p><p>Naruto, like Sasuke, didn't look all that injured on the outside. But his chakra was strangely disrupted, almost as if something had shut it down and rebooted it. I couldn't wake him, not verbally, not physically, not even with a chakra spike.</p><p>"Damn," I muttered, having half had the hope that Naruto would wake and help.</p><p><em> I was on my own</em> . I felt the yawning chasm of fear and squashed it. I needed to get us away from here and somewhere safe. Everything else could wait.</p><p>I got out more rope, glad that my sealing scroll contained almost ridiculous amounts of everything. I was almost numb with cold and exhaustion and pain by the time Naruto hit the ground, his landing less than gentle. I grabbed the rope, and slid down it, barely able to control my own descent. My ribs screamed, by arm ached, my face throbbed.</p><p>I didn't bother to untie the rope, just slashed through it with my kunai, leaving the harness still tied to Naruto.</p><p>"Sorry, Naruto," I said, attaching my shadow to him, forcing him to mimic my movements like a sleepwalker. "There's no way I can carry Sasuke like this."</p><p>Walking was bad enough. Crouching so I could get Naruto to pick Sasuke up… no, I couldn't have carried him.</p><p>I wanted to get distance from the scene of the fight, but I knew we couldn't go far. I was running low on chakra and couldn't hold my Shadow Possession for long, even if Naruto wasn't fighting it.</p><p>I cast my mind back through the hazy, hastily catalogued glances at the forest that I'd taken before and during the fight.</p><p><em> Back this way,</em> I decided, remembering a glimpse out of the corner of my eye. A small clearing. A large tree whose roots poked out of the ground to reveal a small cavern beneath. At the time I'd noticed it more for the clearing - larger distance between safe footholds in the canopy - but for now it would have to do. It was too close for my liking, anyone attracted to the fight would find us, but it was out of the immediate area of destruction.</p><p>It would have to do.</p><p>I shoved the boys in the cavern and set to work guarding it. It was an adequate hiding place with only one side open which made it easier to set traps. I dropped a False Surroundings genjutsu over the camp. It wasn't a particularly high level genjutsu, nor difficult to break - in fact it was the same one they'd used at the First Exam on the second floor - but it was very adaptable. I used it to cover our presence, leaving only an empty clearing behind.</p><p>Then I set up a few basic tripwires, kunai launchers and explosive note traps. There had to be a balance between setting up traps and taking care of my team mates.</p><p>I shoved an antibiotic pill and a generalised antivenom into them both and took some for myself. With the generally unclean nature of the forest, and the giant snakes that had been flying around everywhere we probably needed them. Even if they didn't help they were designed to be used in situations where you could only guess at afflictions and wouldn't make things worse.</p><p>And if they helped Sasuke then that was only a bonus.</p><p>Then I set to tending to <em> myself</em> . There wasn't much I could do for my ribs, but I covered the ends of two senbon and wrapped them to my forearm as a basic split. I folded some bandages into a sling for when I wasn't using it. Then, gingerly, with much cringing and flinching, I got to work cleaning up my face. It took me two and a half flasks of water and several cloths to even remotely remove most of the dirt, and even then I was sure that it wasn't as clean as it could be. Given that my last life was pretty paranoid about infections and the hazards that came from dirty cuts I didn't feel right leaving it, even though it wasn't impeding my combat performance.</p><p>I smeared antiseptic cream liberally over my face and every scratch I could see on both myself and the boys. Sasuke was running a fever, and his breathing was harsh. His heartbeat was erratic, but this wasn't an injury I could heal. I dampened a cloth for him, to try and reduce the fever, but eventually left to return to fortifying our hideout.</p><p>I yawned, feeling achingly tired and half asleep already. Sleep was one of the easiest and most important ways to recoup chakra. So naturally, the opposite could also be true - chakra could be used to substitute for sleep. Not for long, and it wasn't healthy, but most ninja used it when on missions. Like now, when you were deep in enemy territory, sleep could equal death.</p><p>I coaxed my chakra intro running sluggishly through my system. There wasn't much of it left, not if I had to keep holding onto my genjutsu. But dropping it wasn't really an option. I ate, even though I felt nauseous, because I knew I'd need the energy especially if I wasn't going to be sleeping, and went back to rigging the clearing into a field of death.</p><p>If we were going to be attacked, then we needed a hell of a defence.</p><p>By the time I was done, it was maybe three, maybe four o'clock in the morning. I didn't have Naruto's instinctive flair for traps, but we'd learnt enough at the Academy, and anything that saved me from potential danger was something I had paid great attention to.</p><p>I sat back in the cavern, propping myself up against the side and settled into watch, slowly sipping water and nibbling on ration bars. I watched the clearing through half lidded eyes and focused desperately on not falling asleep.</p><p>It would be so easy, too, despite the aches and pains, the nausea, the way the world spun and swum if I moved my head too fast… it would just be so <em> easy</em> to slip off to sleep…</p><p>The birdsong started long before I saw any change in the light levels, but it heralded dawn all the same.</p><p>The light was just beginning to bathe the clearing when I felt the three incoming chakra signals. I didn't move, breathing softly and quietly, hoping they'd be fooled by the genjutsu and keep going.</p><p>They didn't.</p><p>"Some lookout," a voice drawled. It was the Sound Team, as I'd half expected. "You're half asleep. At least you wont have to keep watch anymore. What's the point? We've already found you. Now, wake Sasuke up, we want to fight him." I didn't protest the accusation. If they thought I was half asleep, maybe they'd be less on guard.</p><p>"Sasuke?" I asked mildly, standing up. "I don't know who you're talking about."</p><p>The hunchbacked one snorted. Dosu? Was that his name. "Don't play us for fools, girl. We were told exactly who your team is."</p><p>"Told?" my heart started beating faster, even as I kept my voice level. "By who?… Orochimaru?"</p><p>"That doesn't matter to you," Zaku said, shaking his head and smirking. "What matters to you is that I'm going to kill you, then I'm going to kill Sasuke."</p><p>"So, you intend to kill us?" I asked, voice starting to tremble. This was real. This was real.</p><p>The Sound three grinned. "That's right."</p><p>I nodded. I had expected this. My memories were fuzzy, but Orochimaru had wanted Sasuke tested and he had sent these three to do it. I hoped that the fight wasn't integral to his survival, because I had no intention of letting him use the power of the cursed seal.</p><p>"I can't let you do that," I said. I hoped that the traps I had set were enough. Naruto and Sasuke were out of it. I was on my own.</p><p>And I was heavily injured.</p><p>"Get out of the way, girl," Kin said, pulling out her senbon with bells. "You're nothing to us."</p><p>I didn't wait for her to throw them, hands clumsily forming the Rat seal.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Jutsu!"</p><p>I whirled, forcing her to turn with me and threw half the senbon into Zaku. He was caught off guard, taking two in the shoulder. Senbon weren't good for causing a lot of damage, though, so I didn't expect them to slow him down much. The second handful, I reversed grip on, and punched towards my own temple.</p><p>Zaku and Dosu watched in surprise as Kin stabbed her own senbon through her brain.</p><p>I panted, the sudden expenditure of effort making me sway.</p><p>"You bitch!" Zaku yelled.</p><p>I was vaguely surprised that my Shadow Possession hadn't cut with her death. It was a question I had never asked - could it be used on inanimate or dead objects? I didn't have time to ponder. I drew a kunai from my pouch and Kin mirrored the movement. She was facing towards me, so every action I took had to be in reverse.</p><p>Additionally, I couldn't let myself be drawn too far from my position. Some of the traps had trip wires, but most of them had manual release with the handles close to where I was standing.</p><p>I slashed at them both. They chose to jump backwards out of range. I released the Shadow Possession on Kin, allowing her to slump to the ground. She wasn't any use to me anymore.</p><p>The kunai in my hand, I threw towards them. It missed, thunking harmlessly into a tree trunk.</p><p>Or not so harmlessly.</p><p>It had cut a trip wire that unleashed a barrage of kunai towards them. Then the exploding tags went off.</p><p>That wouldn't have been enough to do more than inconvenience them, if they had been paying attention to the ground they had been standing on. Or perhaps it just didn't strike them as odd that that one patch was so muddy. This was the Forest of Death, and it was fairly wet and damp. Only, that single patch of mud wasn't caused by water, but by kerosene. It went up with a 'whump'. The clearing was large enough that I felt reasonably safe setting a fire here. There wasn't that much fuel, and unless it got blown into a tree, it should gutter soon. Of course, one of my opponents had a technique that utilised pressurized air blasts, so perhaps it wasn't the smartest idea.</p><p>"Crazy bitch!" Dosu cursed. "Vibrating Sound Drill!" His Melody Arm wailed, and the world spun. The distance should have weakened the attack, but I was already concussed. It didn't take much to affect me.</p><p>I crashed to my knees, wretching, using one arm to hold my body up while the other groped about on the ground for my triggers. I didn't care which one I pulled, as long as it kept them occupied for a moment. It seemed to work, because I managed to stagger back to my feet alive.</p><p>I ran through several hand seals, finishing and holding the Rat seal. It wasn't part of the technique, but it was the one I used for Shadow Possession, so it was familiar to my enemies.</p><p>"Nara Art; The Shadow Devours!"</p><p>It was a genjutsu. It had no substance, no shadow. But my opponents had seen me use shadows, knew what I could do with them, so the towering mass of darkness emerging from the forest seeking to envelop them worried them. A lot.</p><p>They jumped back from it, dodged the second rain of kunai I released on them. Zaku sent a Decapitating Airwaves attack directly into the shadows. I made them swirl and then reform around the attack, hoping he wouldn't think to turn it onto the fire.</p><p>I kept up the projectile attacks, releasing wave after wave of kunai and shuriken forcing them to duck and dive out of the way. The only path left for them to take was a narrow gap between the forest and the fire. They leapt for it.</p><p>Only to crash straight into the ninja wire that I had strung up at neck height. In the early morning light, with the fire, with the genjutsu, they couldn't have seen it.</p><p>There was a series of muffled thumps, two heavy, two light as their bodies and heads fell separately to the ground.</p><p>I let the genjutsu fade and collapsed to my knees.</p><p>It seemed… almost too easy.</p><p>Nothing like the heart stopping fear of the fight with Orochimaru. Not even the desperation of facing off against Zabuza. Or the quiet terror that Haku had managed to instil.</p><p>I laughed breathlessly and bitterly. The difference a day makes. A day ago, we were worried about leaving Rain Genin tied up and helpless because they'd be easy prey in this place. Today, I killed three <em> teenagers</em> because it was the easiest option.</p><p>It's easy to be merciful when you're winning.</p><p>I had just <em> killed</em> three teenagers, because it was the <em> easiest option</em> .</p><p>Not because I had to. Not because I had no other choice.</p><p>But because it was easiest.</p><p>There were other options I could have taken. I still had plenty of knockout tags. But incapacitating them without killing them was harder, would have taken longer and left a much greater chance for them to hurt my team mates.</p><p>I've never felt so old before.</p><p>I didn't stay that way long, even though I wanted to… wanted to just curl up and wait for this to be over.</p><p>I couldn't, because there was someone in the trees.</p><p>"I know you're there," I said. "Come down." I trembled, hoping like hell it wasn't some one else to fight. Most of my traps were used up. My chakra was heavily depleted.</p><p><em> Please not Kabuto…</em></p><p>Green blurred. Lee landed in front of me, face solemn.</p><p><em> Shit.</em></p><p>I wasn't Sakura. There was no reason for Lee to be anything other than my enemy here and now.</p><p>He was half a clearing away, in one of the few spots clear of traps. I re-evaluated his threat level upwards. He'd avoid the traps. It might have been luck but I couldn't count on it. He was too fast for them, anyway, too fast for Taijutsu and too fast for my shadow. Genjutsu then. It would be my only option. I put my kunai away.</p><p>"Are you here for the scroll?" I asked. At this point… I would trade all our scrolls for safety. Lee I might be able to take if I was at full strength. Might. But Neji and Tenten couldn't be far away and I was far from being at full strength.</p><p>"I…" He swallowed, then nodded, looking as though he regretted it. I understood, I truly did. It was underhanded but he couldn't pass it up.</p><p>I jerked my head towards the bodies, not breaking eye contact. "Then take it and go," I rasped.</p><p>For a second… he looked awkward, like a thirteen year old confronted with three dead bodies, then with a twitch, a shiver, it was gone leaving behind a primed killing machine, who frisked the bodies expertly.</p><p>"Heaven," he said, pulling it from the second body. "We already have this one." I watched him passively as he held it loosely. He considered it with a furrowed brown then tossed it so it landed halfway between us, and turned to go. He paused and opened his mouth but said nothing.</p><p>I was too tired to think about what he might have said.</p><p>He leapt into the trees, vanishing from my sight. There were two other chakra signals in that direction, probably Neji and Tenten.</p><p>There were three more incoming at speed from my right, but these three were as familiar to me as my own.</p><p>Team 10 burst into the clearing, then stopped in shock.</p><p>"Holy hell!" Ino exclaimed. "What happened to your face?"</p><p>I grimaced and touched the heavy white paste I'd smeared over the gravel rash. "We got our asses kicked."</p><p>Shikamaru was looking around the clearing with an odd expression. "We saw you fighting these guys. Thought you might need a hand. Guess I was wrong."</p><p>I closed my eyes. I didn't want to see their disapproval. "I would have… if I hadn't aimed to kill."</p><p>"Where…" Ino's voice faltered. "Where's your team? Sasuke?"</p><p>"They're… in there," I motioned at the cavern. "They're in bad shape."</p><p>My shoulders slumped.</p><p>"Ino… take 'Kako in there. See what you can do for Sasuke and Naruto," Shikamaru ordered. My brother, giving orders?</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>"We'll take care of this," he finished, turning away.</p><p>I looked wearily at the bodies, suspecting I knew what he meant. "No, no. I've got to show you where the traps are," I protested weakly, staggering to my feet with a wince. My eyes fell on the scroll lying innocently in the middle of the clearing. "What scroll do you guys need?"</p><p>"We aren't taking your scroll!" Ino said, sounding horrified. "Don't even think that! Just because we're in this stupid Exam-"</p><p>I shook my head and then swayed. Right. Don't do that. "No. See. The thing is… the thing is, we have an extra Heaven Scroll." I patted my jacket, checking that I actually still had my one before giving the other one away. "You can have it, if you help us."</p><p>"So you need an Earth Scroll? Man that sucks," Chouji said. He wasn't eating, which was strange.</p><p>"Noooo. We got one of them too," I mumbled. Hopefully Naruto hadn't lost it.</p><p>I could feel them exchanging meaningful glances.</p><p>"Okay," Shika said. "Here's what we're going to do. You're going to show me where the traps are, then you're going to get some rest. We'll take it from here."</p><p>Shikamaru didn't argue, he just worked around your objections to get to his desired outcome.</p><p>I nodded, head bobbling back and forwards on a neck that didn't want to support it. The sheer relief at having them here… it made me want to cry.</p><p><em> Things will be okay, now.</em></p><p>Of course, it couldn't be that easy.</p><p>I was pointing out the traps to Shika and Chouji, my thoughts slip-sliding out of my grasp. I was missing things, I knew it, but Shikamaru was smart enough to spot the ones I was missing. He was mostly just humouring me, anyway.</p><p>Then the black chakra surged inside the cavern.</p><p>My head snapped around.</p><p>"Sasuke!" Even to myself, I sounded frightened.</p><p>I headed back towards the tree hollow, stumbling slightly as the ground seemed to tilt. Concussion, exhaustion and inner ear disruption combining to make me incredibly unstable.</p><p>I paused at the tree roots, eyes adjusting to the darker interior of the cavern.</p><p>Sasuke was giving off waves of corrupted chakra. His body was wreathed in black, the marking burning a livid red, like molten lava. That rancid chakra was spinning about his body, orbiting it like a double helix. It made me nauseous and terrified at the same time.</p><p>Ino was looking at him in worry, not quite able to understand what was going on. "Sasuke, you're awake! Are you hurt? Do you need-"</p><p>"Get out of my way," Sasuke growled at her. His voice was distorted but his face was <em> blank</em> . The markings were creeping their way across his skin.</p><p>"Maybe you should sit down; you were hurt, weren't you?" Ino chattered, ignoring his gruff demand. There was some unease in her expression, though, because she knew this wasn't right.</p><p>His face contorted into anger and his hand raised, curled into a fist, more to shove her out of the way than hit, I think.</p><p>"Ne, Sasuke, are you okay?" Ino asked, leaning forward.</p><p>I saw him twitch.</p><p>I <em> moved</em> .</p><p>My ribs audibly cracked under his fist. I couldn't stop the surprised wail of pain that escaped my mouth, or the little gasping sobs that followed it.</p><p>Sasuke stiffened, the anger on his face fading into a non comprehending puzzlement.</p><p>"Shikako? Who hurt… I hit you?" He stared at his hand, flexing it as though he couldn't believe it had done such a thing.</p><p>I sank to my knees, choking and gasping.</p><p><em> Gods, that hurt…</em></p><p>"Sasuke," I choked out. "You… your chakra was poisoned… you need to stop using chakra…"</p><p>Ino fluttered to my side, her eyes impossibly wide. I ignored her, focusing on Sasuke. I didn't know what would happen if he kept using that. I had to convince him to stop…</p><p>"I feel… I've never felt better…" Sasuke muttered, clenching and unclenching his fist. "I feel so powerful…"</p><p>"It's poison," I wheezed again. "…in your chakra… please stop…"</p><p>His face was conflicted but the marks started to fade away.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Second: Chapter 23</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - now those are some interesting ideas. XD Unfortunately I'm pretty sure Orochimaru (or Oreo, as you call him XD) has countless expendable mooks to use if he really wants.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 23</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> When autumn winds blow </em></p><p><em> not one leaf remains </em></p><p><em> the way it was. </em></p><p><em> ~Togyu</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>After the curse mark induced anger faded Sasuke looked the most disturbed of all of us at his actions. I had no idea what had happened in the fight after I'd been knocked out, but knowing Orochimaru… it couldn't have been kind.</p><p>He'd wandered away from the group, sitting at the edges of the clearing, alone.</p><p>"What kind of monster am I?" Sasuke muttered, staring at his hand. He looked so <em> lost</em> . Young and old and tired at the same time.</p><p>I was tired too. I didn't want to have to play therapist right now. I just wanted to sleep. But it looked like I'd have to.</p><p>"You're not a monster, Sasuke," I said, sitting down next to him. I covered his hand with my own. "Orochimaru poisoned you. Some kind of snake venom, I guess… I'm not an expert on poisons, but they can have all kinds of effects. Hallucinations, emotional imbalance, paranoia, panic, fear, anger…"</p><p>It was a lie, but a reasonable one. I could recognise the curse mark as a seal, but no one would expect me to know more than that.</p><p>I pulled the small pill bottle out of my med kit and handed it to him. "Antivenom," I explained. "I gave one to you before… but until we see a medic I think you should take one each day."</p><p>They might not affect the curse mark, but they would remind him that he was <em> sick. </em> That Orochimaru had done something to him. There might be a placebo effect, as well, and those couldn't be discounted.</p><p>He took the bottle numbly. "I didn't feel weak. I felt strong. So powerful… He said it was a gift. I thought… That I'm an Avenger. To follow my path, I must have power, at any price even if it means being consumed by evil…" he glanced up at me through the veil of his hair. "If I was stronger… If I was more powerful… this wouldn't have happened."</p><p><em> Shit. This needs to be nipped in the bud. Now.</em></p><p>"It isn't power that's your problem, Sasuke. Power comes easy… it's knowing <em> when</em> and <em> how</em> to use it. You've already seen that, haven't you?" I squeezed his hand reassuringly. "If you don't use it, it's useless. But if <em> it</em> uses you… that's even worse."</p><p>I hoped I got through to him. I wasn't at my best. I couldn't dream up compelling arguments. I wished Naruto was awake…</p><p>"I'm sorry," he blurted out.</p><p>"It's okay."</p><p>"No, its not. It's really not. I hurt you. I would have hurt Ino. And… and… before… You fought and I did nothing…" His hands clenched in shame. "I was weak. I was <em> scared. </em> I… All I could think about was <em> that man</em> and how, if I died there I'd never get to fight him…"</p><p>"I was scared too," I admitted, my voice sounding distant even to me. "I knew we didn't stand a chance, right from the moment he attacked us… from the moment I felt his chakra…"</p><p>"Then how could you do it?" Sasuke asked, voice sounding anguished. "How could you just <em> attack</em> ?"</p><p>"I couldn't, at first. I was scared stiff. Then … he was going to kill us. If it had just been me, by myself…" Well. He probably wouldn't have attacked me. But that wasn't what Sasuke needed to hear. "I probably couldn't have done it. But he was going to hurt you, and then Naruto… and there wasn't even a <em> choice</em> anymore." I smirked, half heartedly. "It's like Haku said, 'when you're protecting something precious-'"</p><p>"That's when you become truly strong," Sasuke finished. "There wasn't even a choice," he repeated. "Like… your body just moves on its own."</p><p>That was how he had explained saving Naruto, way back there on the bridge. <em> My body just moved on it's own.</em></p><p>"We're a team," I said. "That's what it means. You fight when I can't and I fight when you can't. And when we can… when all three of us can fight together… no one will stand a chance."</p><p>He smirked half heartedly back at me, recognising my attempt to … lighten the mood? cheer him up? motivate him? …Whatever I was trying to do.</p><p>I sighed, leaning into him. "If the poison is in your chakra system, you should probably avoid using chakra," I mumbled, eyelids sliding shut against my will. They were just so <em> heavy</em> …"Stop it spreading…"</p><p>There was more I wanted to say…</p><p>"Is she asleep?" I heard Shika ask distantly. I tried to fight my eyelids, to see what he wanted, but they were too heavy, and the sunlight was so warm… he could wait, couldn't he?</p><p>"Yeah, I think so," Sasuke replied, sounding just as far away. I struggled to come back to awareness.</p><p>"Good, because I have some things to say to you." Shikamaru's voice sounded funny, more like Dad when he was truly serious. Flat and a little grim… It was a tone of voice that always made me remember that he was a shinobi, a good one, and not just my lazy, slightly goofy father.</p><p>For a second, just a second, I had a flash of an older Shikamaru, cigarette dangling from his fingers and world weary eyes.</p><p>I gave up the fight and drifted off to sleep.</p><p>When I blinked awake, I felt even worse than before. I felt stiff and gummy to add to all my other aches and pains. My mouth was dry and tasted of ash and my eyes ached at the brightness of the light.</p><p>It was about noon, so I hadn't been sleeping long, but it looked like Team 10 had been busy. The giant bonfire had been put out and my field of death had been mostly dismantled. The bodies were stacked off to the side, and probably stripped of all useful equipment.</p><p>Looking at them made me feel strange, weirdly empty, like I should be feeling guilty but wasn't, so I glanced away.</p><p>"'Bout time you woke up," Ino said playfully, hands on hips. "Leaving us to do all the hard work. Hmph!" Her cheerfulness sounded a little forced, and she was so pointedly ignoring the bodies that it was obvious.</p><p>I cracked a smile, then winced as it pulled at my raw cheek. "Well, I figured you guys didn't have anything else to do…"</p><p>She examined me critically. "You are such a mess right now. I don't even know where to start."</p><p>"Help me bind my ribs?" I asked. Every time I bent or twisted, they complained, so if we were going to be moving they needed to be dealt with.</p><p>Ino's eyes flickered over my shoulder, just briefly. "Sure! You've got bandages?"</p><p>I nodded. "In my backpack."</p><p>"I'll grab it," she said decisively. "You just stay here."</p><p>I watched her go, then turned slightly to see what she had looked at. Shikamaru and Sasuke were in the process of dismantling another trap, winding ninja wire and sorting through a ridiculously large pile of kunai. Hmm, I might have overdone it a bit, there.</p><p>Shika must have sensed I was looking, because he looked up and casually waved his hand in a lazy greeting. Sasuke peered around, caught my eye and then… flinched?</p><p><em> Interesting.</em></p><p>There was relief in his body language, but the set of his shoulders spoke of wariness. Not quite fear but certainly apprehension. And he didn't turn away from Shikamaru.</p><p><em> What, exactly, did you say to him, brother dear?</em> I wondered. I was sure I remembered the beginning of a conversation, though it was blurred enough that it could have been a dream. It took a lot to get Shikamaru to <em> initiate</em> a conversation.</p><p>"I've got your stuff," Ino announced brightly, flouncing back across the clearing, backpack in hand. "Come on!"</p><p>She dragged me off into the trees, far enough away that we had some privacy, but still within shouting distance. With her help, I managed to get bandages wrapped tightly around my torso, the pressure counteracting the weird shifting, unstable feeling. I had delightful purple bruises practically <em> everywhere</em> it seemed.</p><p>"I feel like a grape," I muttered in disgust.</p><p>Ino snorted. "Well, you look more like a panda," she joked. "You've got such a lovely pair of black eyes."</p><p>"Broke my nose," I explained. Which had probably burst the blood vessels around the bridge of my nose, explaining the bruising.</p><p>"Seriously, what the hell <em> happened</em> to you guys? You're a mess and Sasuke and Naruto were both out of it…" She trailed off at the mention of just how 'out of it' Sasuke had been.</p><p>"I'll explain later," I brushed her off. "I don't want to have to go over it more than once…"</p><p>"You better," she said meanly, dabbing a wet cloth at my face. I hissed as it stung. "We haven't been able to wake Naruto up at all and Sasuke hasn't said two words since you fell asleep on him. Lucky girl," she added enviously. That was forced, too. Ino, I realised, was really scared.</p><p><em> That makes two of us.</em></p><p>"You won't believe it," I muttered, then forced my mind away from the issue. "So you never said what scroll you guys started with."</p><p>Ino hesitated for a second. "Earth. We haven't had any luck finding a second scroll, but it's only the second day!"</p><p>I blinked. "I'm pretty sure that Sound team had a Heaven Scroll. And we've already got our two."</p><p>"You said that before." Ino shrugged. "We just weren't sure if you were, y'know, with it. You seemed pretty dazed."</p><p>I couldn't help but smirk. "I probably wasn't," I acknowledged. "But our chances of getting to the tower like this …"</p><p>"I for one, totally can't wait to get out of this forest," Ino agreed. "But you best make a team decision on that one, yeah?"</p><p>I shrugged. I couldn't really foresee any arguing on this one.</p><p>"Okay, that's as best as I can clean you up." She winced in sympathy. "That's probably going to scar really badly."</p><p>Without a mirror, I couldn't tell how bad it was but it <em> was</em> pretty painful. My fingers flowed through the hand seals.</p><p>"Mystical Palm Jutsu." Green light gathered in my hands and I held it to my face, coaxing the tissue to heal. I didn't manage to completely heal it before the jutsu started fading and I pulled it away to quickly flush the worst of my other injuries. Okay, so focusing on my face first was kinda vain.</p><p>Ino nodded approvingly. "You look less like an extra from a horror movie now," she commented.</p><p>I snorted. "Come on. Let's get back to the boys before they burn the forest down, or something."</p><p>"Who was the one that started the bonfire?" Ino shot back at me, helping pack up the stuff we'd used.</p><p>"Pshaw. I had that perfectly under control."</p><p>"Uhuh. Right. I believe you." The tone of her voice said she clearly didn't.</p><p>I couldn't help but smile at the easy banter. Ino was Ino, scared, horrified or whatever. I was really, truly grateful.</p><p>"So what's the plan?" I asked, coming back into the clearing.</p><p>"That depends," Shikamaru drawled. His eyes were assessing, nothing like his normal blank, indifferent gaze. "On whether you're capable of moving."</p><p>"Not fast," I admitted. "And if Naruto doesn't wake…"</p><p>"Yeah." Shika sighed, hands clasping together. "This is such a drag."</p><p>"I think we should call a truce and stick together," I volunteered. "If we move soon, we should be able to get to the tower before nightfall. Then we'd be safe to recover instead of wasting time here."</p><p>Sasuke frowned, but didn't object. I was injured, he was potentially chakra deprived and Naruto was unconscious still.</p><p>"Sasuke! Shikako!" A voice yelped, and Naruto came tumbling out of the cavern, then stood blinking stupidly in the sunlight. "Ehehehe, whoops?"</p><p>Or maybe not so unconscious. I grinned.</p><p>"Oh, man! What happened here? Did that crazy snake lady do this?" Naruto blinked at the clearing.</p><p><em> Something like that</em> , I bit back my automatic response. In the spirit of team trust and unity, I'd probably have to tell them. I just wasn't looking forward to it.</p><p>"Eh, these guys attacked us while you and Sasuke were having your beauty sleep," I teased.</p><p>"It's lucky your brother's team was here then," Sasuke observed quietly. "Otherwise we could have been in trouble."</p><p>I blinked. Oh. Team Ten had been here when he had woken up, hadn't they? So, Sasuke thought…</p><p>"They didn't get here till after," I said casually, glancing away from him.</p><p>Sasuke's eyes widened. That was the only hint of shock that he allowed to show on his face.</p><p>"Huh? Then what happened here?" Naruto asked cluelessly. "If we were out of it and they weren't here…" he trailed off.</p><p>I nodded. "I killed them," I admitted. We'd fought on the bridge, even possibly killed people, but it had been too rushed to know which hits were fatal and which weren't. I suspected Sensei and Zabuza had done most of the actual killing then. That meant that this was the first time we had been faced with bodies we <em> knew</em> one of us had killed.</p><p>"They said they were sent by Orochimaru," I continued as the silence stretched out. I didn't look at either of them. I didn't want to see their expressions. It was hard enough to know that they <em> knew.</em> "To kill Sasuke."</p><p>"What?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"Whoa, wait. Hold up," Ino cut in, waving her arms. "Orochimaru? Where does he come in?"</p><p>It was clear that she recognised the name. That was to be expected. Ino <em> was</em> the daughter of the previous head of the Intelligence Division.</p><p>"That was the name of the guy who attacked us," Sasuke said. I wasn't sure whether <em> he </em> recognised the name or not.</p><p>Shikamaru was staring at us in horror. "Was it? Really?"</p><p>I nodded. "Yeah. He was throwing A-rank jutsu around like candy. <em> Without</em> seals." I couldn't even do the Replacement Technique without seals.</p><p>"Why would he be here in the Chunin Exams?" Ino demanded. "This isn't… he…"</p><p>"I don't get it," Naruto complained. "Who's Orochimaru?"</p><p>"An S-ranked missing nin from Konoha," Shika replied quietly. "A really dangerous enemy of the village. You three…are lucky to be alive."</p><p>"I think he was after Sasuke. The fact that we <em> survived</em> seems to say that he has some kind of plan," I said. "Sasuke? Did he say anything to you?"</p><p>"Just… about my Sharingan," Sasuke said slowly. "I wasn't… I wasn't really <em> listening</em> to him."</p><p>Apparently Sasuke's will to fight had come back with a vengeance after the two of us had been knocked out. I'd sort of seen the results of that, when I'd been trying to get the two of them to safety but I'd had more pressing things to worry about at the time.</p><p>Team Ten listened to the story in a kind of disbelieving horror, as the three of us filled in our own parts of the story. Apparently Naruto really <em> had</em> been eaten by a giant snake. Go figure.</p><p>"Oh, man," Shika groaned. "And I thought the hardest part of this Exam was supposed to be the other <em> Genin</em> ."</p><p>Chouji was frozen, a handful of chips halfway to his mouth. "He's gone, though, right? He's not coming back or anything?"</p><p>I felt a flash of sheer terror at the idea, and I'm sure that Sasuke wasn't any better off.</p><p>I swallowed. "Probably?" I offered weakly. We had no proof either way, and no reason to believe we were safe.</p><p>"Lets get to the tower," Naruto said, looking nervous. He hadn't been around for much of the fight, but enough to know we didn't want to go through that again.</p><p>Ino smiled weakly. "I never thought I'd agree with Naruto but… that sounds like a plan to me."</p><p>"Okay." Sasuke nodded. "Let's pack up and move out."</p><p>We burst into a flurry of activity, gathering scattered items and shoving them hastily in our bags. We all double checked that we had our scrolls and exchanged nervous glances. All of a sudden it felt like we had a much greater reason to get to the tower as fast as possible.</p><p>"Here, I'll help you," Sasuke said quietly, sliding up beside me. His eyes were dark and shadowed.</p><p>It probably wouldn't make us move any faster, and my ribs twinged at the movement but I slung an arm over his shoulder. It wasn't about that.</p><p>"We'll help each other hobble there," I said.</p><p><em> I'm sorry.</em></p><p><em> I forgive you.</em></p><p>The path to the tower was pretty long. We had to stick to the ground; tree jumping was out of the question for Sasuke and I. Ino and I were on sensory duty, keeping lookout for traps and ambushes. Chakra sensing was one of the skills of the Yamanaka clan, though I'd never tested myself against Ino to see how we compared. Added to that, she was naturally sharp and good at picking out details that didn't belong.</p><p>We had to detour several times to avoid running into other teams, but the increased travel time was regarded as being worth not fighting. Granted, there were twice as many of us as them, but two of us wouldn't be much help and Team Ten wasn't exactly the strongest team combat wise.</p><p>At one point, we came across the body of a girl, laid out in a small clearing, that looked like she had been mauled by a wild animal.</p><p>"Trap?" Sasuke suggested quietly.</p><p>I shook my head. "I can't sense any chakra. If it's a trap, it's a good one."</p><p>"Stay alert," Shikamaru said.</p><p>We crept forward, an ungainly procession.</p><p>She didn't look any older than us, with red hair and dirt encrusted clothing. "Grass," I said, spotting her headband. After Orochimaru that symbol left a foul taste in my mouth. Were they working with him, or merely more victims?</p><p>Chouji sighed. "This Exam is really…"</p><p>"Yeah," Ino said sombrely.</p><p>"Nothing we can do," Shikamaru said, running a hand over his hair. "Let's keep going."</p><p>There were other bodies too. A team of Konoha Genin peppered with kunai near some abandoned - but still loaded - spring launcher traps. The remains of an arm that looked like it had been <em> torn</em> off its body. A team floating face down in the river.</p><p>"Glad we didn't drink from that," I muttered. Sure, it was a bit of a tasteless comment, but the grim atmosphere was grating on my nerves.</p><p>"Blech," Naruto replied, screwing his face up. "That's so gross."</p><p>"Ugk, you're right," Ino said. "Please tell me we don't have to swim through that." She glanced at Shikamaru like she was <em> daring</em> him to say otherwise.</p><p>He shrugged. "There isn't really much of an option. We've been circling around to find a spot we can pass through for the last kilometre. I had hoped we could go straight up the river but it looks like someone has already thought of that. Still… the other side of the river might not be any better."</p><p>I considered too. "Hey Naruto. Do you think you have enough chakra for a Hidden in the Mist Jutsu? A really big one?"</p><p>"Sure! No problem. How big do you want it?" He asked eagerly.</p><p>"Do you remember where those two trees that formed that kind of archway were? Think you can make it all the way to there?" If we could block sight for that distance, then sneaking through the gaps between two of the ambushes would be much easier.</p><p>"Yeah, I think so. But … I never managed to get that sensing thing done…" He shuffled.</p><p>"That's okay. If we all stick close together, I can guide us through," I reassured him.</p><p>"Hidden in the Mist Jutsu?" Shikamaru asked, shoving his hands in his pockets and slouching.</p><p>"Just watch," I said.</p><p>Naruto's chakra spiked and grew. And grew and grew. The water started rising off the river, almost like it was steaming. It condensed and then started spreading out, engulfing us, then the trees and then further and further. I could feel the wave of his chakra carrying the mist away.</p><p>He stopped, panting and opened his eyes. "Oh," he said, disappointed. "I was trying to make it thicker than that." He flexed his fingers, uncertainly. "My chakra is all weird."</p><p>I cursed myself for an idiot and exchanged alarmed glances with Sasuke. "Damn. Orochimaru did something to your chakra system. That's what knocked you out. It must have done other things, too…"</p><p><em> How could I have overlooked that?</em></p><p>Naruto smiled widely, but it looked a bit forced. "Hey, don't worry! I'm an awesome ninja, I can handle it!"</p><p>"We'll get someone to look at you when we get to the tower, too," I promised.</p><p>"We better move quickly," Sasuke said. "Before the mist fades."</p><p>"Right," I said, nodding. "Everyone, stick close."</p><p>I moved forwards, trusting my memory and sensory abilities to help navigate a safe path. If we'd been moving faster, it would have been more difficult, but circumstances were forcing us to move slowly, anyway.</p><p>I gave one spot a particularly wide berth, because I felt the sharp metallic tang of chakra - like the glint of a knife, like the iron in blood - that I was positive was Kabuto. No need for more trouble.</p><p>The mist was plenty thick, even this far out from the river, that we had no trouble. Given the nature of the Forest of Death, no one could be quite sure it <em> wasn't</em> natural, but everyone was primed for an attack as it covered them, letting us slip past uncontested.</p><p>There were a few close calls, and Naruto once sent a pair of Shadow Clones off to create a diversion, but we got through.</p><p>"Almost exactly twenty four hours," Shikamaru said, cracking his neck. "Not bad."</p><p>"Hardly breaking any records," I replied. "But considering the circumstances…"</p><p>Hesitantly, Naruto and Chouji taking point, we entered one of the rooms. They were huge… and empty.</p><p>"Alright, now what?" Naruto asked expectantly.</p><p>The only thing that really stood out in the room was the huge scroll on the back wall.</p><p>"If qualities of Heaven are your desire, acquire wisdom to take your mind higher," I read out. "If qualities of Earth are what you lack, train your body and prepare to attack. When Heaven and Earth are open together, the peerless path will be righteous forever. This…. Is the secret way that guides us from this place today."</p><p>"What on earth does that even <em> mean?</em> " Naruto asked, flailing his arms around.</p><p>"The scrolls," Shika answered with a yawn. "Heaven and Earth representing mental and physical energy. Together they make chakra, so, if we put the scrolls together, we get something."</p><p>"Didn't they tell us not to open them?" Ino asked hesitantly.</p><p>I closed my eyes and recited from memory. "But most importantly, none of you, absolutely none of you, may look at the contents of the scroll until you reach the tower."</p><p>"Which implies that once we're <em> at</em> the tower, they're fair game," Shikamaru finished.</p><p>"If Shikamaru says so," Chouji said, shrugging and opening a new bag of potato chips. Chouji's faith was simple and absolute. If Shikamaru said it was true, it must be true.</p><p>Ino sighed. "Alright, alright. You better not be getting us disqualified," she threatened.</p><p>I squirmed an arm around to retrieve the scroll from my inner jacket pocket. "Open them at the same time?" I suggested.</p><p>Sasuke took it from me, since I didn't have two hands to open it with, but without actually letting me go. I wondered if he realised that it wasn't my <em> legs</em> that were injured. I could stand perfectly fine on my own.</p><p>"Naruto?" Sasuke asked, grasping the edges of the scroll.</p><p>Naruto nodded firmly. "Ready!"</p><p>They pulled them open. The contents were simple. The Kanji for person - 'hito' - was scrawled in the middle of a sealing circle.</p><p><em> Interesting.</em></p><p>"This is a summoning jutsu," Sasuke shouted. "Quick, get rid of the scrolls!" Unerringly, he threw the scroll away, Naruto's following in it's path a second later. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Chouji and Ino doing the same.</p><p>Summoning people wasn't done very often. The person being summoned would need to have a complimentary seal that would activate and drag them to the scrolls. Added to that, they were complicated, took a fair amount of chakra and didn't have that much of a range. It was flashy, but not very practical.</p><p>Chakra smoke exploded from the two sets of scrolls, nearly simultaneously. I felt the surge in chakra as two new signals appeared in the room.</p><p>"Hey. Long time, no see," Iruka-sensei said.</p><p>"Two at once, huh?" The other Chunin said. Kotetsu, I think his name was. "Well, it's not against the rules, but you aren't making things easy for yourselves, you know."</p><p>Iruka-sensei's gaze drifted over all of us, lingering the longest on me. I guess that was fair, since I was the most beat up looking. "Looks like you've gone through a lot in this test," he said.</p><p>"Hey, wait!" Naruto exclaimed. "What's the deal with the surprise entrance? Why did you appear with the summoning?"</p><p>"Well, at the end of the second test, we Chunin are given the important task of welcoming the test takers back. My being here? That's just luck."</p><p>"Luck," the other Chunin coughed. "Not like you've been greeting <em> every</em> incoming team on the off chance…"</p><p>Iruka-sensei glared at him, rubbing the scar across his nose. "You didn't <em> have</em> to say that, you know," he complained.</p><p>"Every team?" Shikamaru drawled. "So others have completed the test already."</p><p>"That's right," Kotetsu confirmed. "There are two teams already here." He flicked a glance at Iruka. "Do you wanna give the speech to both of them? There's not really any point in me repeating it all."</p><p>"Sure," Iruka-sensei agreed. "You can go back to slacking off and doing nothing." There was a twist of annoyance to his words.</p><p>Kotetsu vanished with a jaunty wave and a burst of Body Flicker speed.</p><p>"That's my kinda job," I heard Shika mumble under his breath.</p><p>"Congratulations," Iruka-sensei said, smiling at us all. "You've passed the Second Exam."</p><p>"We passed?" Naruto asked, disbelief colouring his voice. "We passed! That's so cool!" He leapt forward, glomping onto Iruka-sensei.</p><p>"Hey, wait! I'm not done!" Iruka-sensei protested, trying to get him off.</p><p>I snickered. Sasuke smirked.</p><p>"Idiot!" Ino scolded. "Get off him! What if there's something important we need to hear?"</p><p>Naruto dropped back to the ground, and rubbed the back of his head. "Hehe, sorry Ino. I'm just so excited, you know?"</p><p>Iruka-sensei smiled. "Well, I can see you're just as hyperactive as ever, Naruto."</p><p>"Hmph! No weird test or crazy snake guys are going to keep me down!" Naruto said, thumb pointing to himself.</p><p>"Ahem. Right, where was I?" Iruka-sensei said. "Just like the First Exam, the second stage of the Chunin Exams was supposed to test many different factors - your survival skills, your combat skills, your ability to find and retrieve specific items, but also to see if you could stick it out to complete a difficult mission. That's where the scrolls come in. Simply put, you knew that opening the scrolls was against the rules, and if you'd tried to open one… if a scroll was opened, we were ordered to knock out whoever opened it. Some ninja found that out the hard way." There was a flash of grim amusement in his tone.</p><p>Actually, I'd been much happier believing there was a paralysing seal written on the scrolls, considering who some of the <em> Genin</em> in this test were. Then again, those capable of defeating an unexpected attack from a Chunin probably wouldn't have opened the scrolls in the first place.</p><p>"So if we'd opened the scroll in the forest, you would have knocked us out?" Naruto clarified.</p><p>"You'd have had to be pretty stupid to try that," Ino said with a huff. "After all the fuss Anko made about it." She paused. "You didn't try, did you?"</p><p>"What?" Naruto yelped. "No way! That was the safest scroll in the whole forest, even from people peeking at it! Believe it!"</p><p>"We believe you," I assured him. With Naruto, a little trust went a long way.</p><p>Iruka-sensei was really smiling now. "So did you six read the scroll on the wall there? These are instructions that the First Hokage recorded as principles that Chunin should follow."</p><p>"Yeah, but did he have to do it in rhyme?" Shika complained. "That just makes it even more troublesome."</p><p>"Heaven and Earth representing mental and physical energy, like in chakra," Naruto paraphrased, nodding his head sagely.</p><p>Iruka-sensei blinked in surprise. "That's… exactly right, Naruto. I'm surprised. Heaven stands for your mind, and Earth for your body. I'll explain. If your weakness lies in your intellect, <em> Naruto</em> , you need to make doubly sure you work hard to remember all the important information and skills that you need to prepare for your missions."</p><p>"Ugh. Okay, I get your point." Naruto crossed his arms and pouted.</p><p>"So if your weakness lies in your physical strength<em> , Shikamaru</em> , then you have to make sure you work on your physical conditioning every single day so it improves all the time."</p><p>"You sound like my mother," Shika complained, tucking his hands behind his head and staring at the ceiling.</p><p>Iruka-sensei sighed theatrically. "Well, I tried. So if your mind and body are working together as one then even a very dangerous mission can become an easy one. The missing character is the one on the scrolls. It stands for person. It's meant to represent you Genin. This Exam was supposed to test your abilities as Chunin and to see if you'd be any good at it. And, I have to say, you guys really did magnificently. A Chunin is a leader, a guide. It's a Chunin's responsibility to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of those serving under them and to know what skills and training those ninja are going to need to succeed on a mission. You did an excellent job on your mission and I want you to remember these instructions on your next one. Well, that's it. That's everything I was supposed to say to you."</p><p>He paused, and looked at us all for a long moment, indecision crossing his face. "One more thing… for the third exam… don't push it too far. Especially you, Naruto. I worry-"</p><p>Naruto cut him off. "Iruka-sensei. When I got this headband, I stopped being a student. So you don't need to worry about me anymore. I mean, this headband is proof that I'm a full fledged ninja, right? You gave it to me. I may still be hyper, but I'm not a kid. Like you said, I got through the Second Exam and you just watch… I'm going to pass the Third one for sure! I'm a ninja too!"</p><p>It seemed like everyone was standing a little straight, looking a little more focused. Ino had an odd, indecipherable look on her face as she watched him. Even Shika seemed a little more awake.</p><p>"Naruto. You're right. I'm sorry about that. I'm sure you'll do brilliantly," Iruka-sensei said. "Now. The Exam doesn't officially end until the five days are up, so you'll be staying in the tower until then. Unfortunately…" his eyes flickered over me, and, interestingly, Sasuke. "Until the test is officially over, you can't be seen to by a medic. If you do chose to, it may affect your ability to participate in the Third Exam, depending on what happens between now and the end of the Exam."</p><p>So they did know about Sasuke's curse mark.</p><p>"Shikako?" Sasuke asked, hesitance in his voice.</p><p>I knew what he was asking. "My injuries are all superficial," I said. Well. To a certain extent. Maybe 'non-life threatening' would be a better way of putting it. "How are <em> you</em> feeling?" Sasuke was the one 'poisoned' after all. That was more serious.</p><p>He blinked. "Fine for now. Naruto?"</p><p>"Don't worry about me!" Naruto exclaimed. "I didn't even notice until I tried to use that jutsu." He grinned foxily.</p><p>"Alright. I'll show you the way to where the rest of the Genin are staying," Iruka-sensei said. "Follow me."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Second: Chapter 24</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Everyone sounds like they <em> really</em> want to know what Shikamaru said to Sasuke. XD I actually deliberately left it out; it's much more behind-the-scenes scary that way. Which, frankly, I think suits Shikamaru more. You know he said something, but the details are fuzzy. Sasuke knows, and it freaks him out. What does it take to freak out Sasuke, huh?</p><p>Also, 200 reviews! W00t!</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 24</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Letting go doesn't mean giving up, but rather accepting that there are things that cannot be. - Anon</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Well, well, well, look who's here," Kiba greeted as Iruka-sensei let us loose in the tower with the admonishment that the top three levels were out of bounds. "All nine rookies made it through. That has to be a record. Man, you guys look beat." His gaze lingered over me.</p><p>"We ran into some trouble," I said lightly.</p><p>"So Team 8 is already here," Sasuke commented.</p><p>"We were the second team here," Kiba boasted.</p><p>This kind of set up was pretty much the perfect mission for Team 8, track and retrieve. The real eyebrow raiser was that someone had beaten them here.</p><p>"Yeah?" Shika asked lazily. "When'd you guys get in?"</p><p>"Late last night. It's just been us and that creepy Sand team all day." He looked nervous. "Stay away from them. That guy is bad news. You don't <em> want</em> to know what we saw him do in the forest."</p><p>"Gaara?" Naruto asked, frowning. "Yeah. We ran into him before the Exams even started." He shivered.</p><p>"So what's the deal with this place?" Ino cut in. "Please tell me there's a shower."</p><p>"And food!" Chouji chimed in.</p><p>Kiba snorted. "Yeah, yeah. What am I, a tour guide? Come on, I'll show you where we're staying." He turned and started walking, expecting us to follow. We didn't really have any better options.</p><p>"I get the feeling this place doesn't get used a lot," he continued. "It's pretty empty, y'know? Most of it is barracks and storage rooms and things like that. I'm pretty sure the upper levels are where the Chunin are working since we're not allowed up there. We haven't seen them since we got in either, except the guy that brings the food down."</p><p>He knocked on one of the doors before opening it. "Hey guys. You'll never guess what I found."</p><p>'Barracks' was the right description for the place. Bunk room, as well. There were bunk beds covering three of the walls, at least sixteen beds total, with a second door to the side that I suspected led to the bathroom. Three of the lower bunks - more easily defendable - looked in use so I suspected that was where Team 8 was sleeping.</p><p>"N-Naruto!" Hinata said, surprised. "A-and everyone else, of course!" She bowed politely.</p><p>"Hey Hinata. Shino." I waved. "You guys don't mind if we crash in your room, do you?"</p><p>Shino adjusted his glasses. "Is that wise? We are still rival competitors for this Examination."</p><p>"Second Exam is over," Shika pointed out, still looking like he didn't care one way or the other. "For us, anyway. And the Third Exam doesn't start till later anyway."</p><p>"Y-yes!" Hinata shrunk back as her voice came out slightly too loud. "I mean, i-if you want to stay here… there's plenty of space, isn't there? We don't mind."</p><p>"Thanks, Hinata!" Naruto exclaimed, hands tucking behind his head. "You're alright, you know that?"</p><p>Her cheeks went pink so fast.</p><p>Ino gave her a knowing look. "Sounds good to me. It'll give us a chance to catch up. Everyone's been so busy since graduation!"</p><p>"Yeah, tell me about it," Kiba grumbled good naturedly. "If it isn't my mum, it's Kurenai-sensei and if it isn't her it's Hana. All 'do some training, Kiba', 'you're a real ninja now, Kiba, you can't just slack off anymore'." He rolled his eyes. "Hopefully this'll show them, right?"</p><p>Shikamaru flopped down on one of the bunks. "It's just so troublesome," he complained.</p><p>I snickered. "Just think," I teased. "If you don't make Chunin this time… you'll have to do it all over again."</p><p>Ino snickered too. "Hey! You'll probably end up like that Kabuto guy. How many was it? Eight times?"</p><p>"Don't even joke about that," Shika muttered. "I'll have nightmares about it."</p><p>"Same old Shikamaru," Naruto said. "You're as lazy as ever."</p><p>Sasuke, on the other hand, said nothing. He was <em> still</em> giving my brother a wary look.</p><p>We settled in, joking and laughing, sharing anecdotes about what had happened since graduation. Team 8 hadn't heard about our C turned A-rank, so Naruto got to retell the story, complete with arm gestures, much to Hinata's delight.</p><p>It was loud and companionable and <em> nice</em> .</p><p>"Man, I'm getting hungry," Chouji said. "You said they had food here, right?"</p><p>Kiba rolled his eyes. "Yeah. There's a kitchen upstairs that the Chunin keep stocked with food. Bring some down for us, would you? Since we're playing gracious hosts and all."</p><p>Chouji was practically out the door already.</p><p>Ino scampered after him. "Oh no you don't. I know you, Chouji, you'll just get fattening food! I'm coming too!"</p><p>"Yes! Food! No more ration bars!" Naruto exclaimed. "Oooh, maybe they have <em> ramen</em> !"</p><p>"I hope that's not all he brings back," I said to Sasuke.</p><p>He winced. "Wait up, idiot!" he barked. Sasuke was still moving stiffly, fist clenching every now and then as spasms of pain radiated from the curse mark. I watched him go in worry.</p><p>I waited for my team to be out of earshot before I turned and pinned Shikamaru with a serious look.</p><p>"Shikamaru," I asked lightly. "What exactly did you say to Sasuke?"</p><p>He rolled his head to look at me out of the corner of his eyes and sighed. "It'd be troublesome… but you are my little sister. So… there are some things that aren't allowed to happen."</p><p>I studied him for a while. It took a lot to rouse Shikamaru to action… but you <em> never</em> wanted to be his enemy when it did.</p><p>"You threatened him, didn't you?"</p><p>He shrugged and wouldn't answer any more questions.</p><p>"Shikamaru? He's about as threatening as Hinata!" Kiba scoffed.</p><p>"Kiba," Hinata protested quietly, tapping her fingers together. "I-I'm sure Shikamaru…" she trailed off indecisively.</p><p>"Haven't you heard the saying?" I grinned. "The three things any Konoha nin fears: An angry Aburame, a focused Inuzuka… and a motivated Nara."</p><p>Kiba barked a laugh. "Yeah, I've heard that. But you're a Nara and you seem plenty motivated to me."</p><p>…<em> muffled thumps, two heavy, two light as the bodies and heads fell separately to the ground…</em></p><p>If my grin was a tad sharper, wilder, I couldn't help it. "Best be scared, then, ne?"</p><p>"As if," Kiba dismissed, but Shino was watching me closely. Shino, I knew, was very observant. <em> What</em> he was observing was up for debate. "Why would he be threatening Sasuke anyway? I mean, I know the guys a bit of a jerk but it's not like that ever bothered you before."</p><p>Shikamaru looked up. "He broke her ribs," he said, clearly and carefully.</p><p>Akamaru yipped. Kiba looked horrified. Inuzuka were loyal. Attacking a team mate was seriously against their beliefs.</p><p>I winced. "I'm pretty sure they were already broken before that," I said weakly. Yeah, it didn't sound like much of a defence to me either.</p><p>There was a pause, and I was damn sure the Team 8 was reassessing my injuries.</p><p>I sighed. "Okay. Here's what happened." I wasn't sure whether telling them was the right thing to do, but on the other hand, there wasn't really a good reason to <em> not</em> tell them. Particularly if it would help warn them about what was to come. I told them about the Orochimaru fight, but skimmed very quickly over the Sound team except for mentioning that he's sent them. Then I told them about the curse mark though I didn't use those words.</p><p>"You're serious?" Kiba asked, breaking the silence when I'd finished. "You're not just …pulling our legs or something?"</p><p>I shook my head. "Completely serious. I wouldn't joke about something like this."</p><p>Shino adjusted his glasses again, the only sign of discomfort he allowed himself. "That is… disturbing news. One would think that the ANBU would move to prevent such a thing happening, or cease the Chunin Exams while he was here."</p><p>"How can they?" I replied. "Doing something like that would just make Konoha seem weak to the other villages that are here… if we can't even defend ourselves from missing nin…" I trailed off leaving the thought open. "I don't exactly agree with it, especially since he seems to be targeting my team mate, but stopping the Chunin Exams would cause more problems than it would solve."</p><p><em> Besides, we're only Genin. They haven't invested </em> that<em> much into us.</em></p><p>"Damn," Kiba whistled. "I know we're enemies for this Exam and all… but if he pops up again just say the word and we have your back."</p><p>"I - Thanks, Kiba," I said, caught off guard. Hinata nodded, as firm as I've ever seen her.</p><p>"Well, we can't let you hog all the good fights," he said. "Me and Akamaru will show you how it's done, right boy?"</p><p>Akamaru barked.</p><p>"Tada!" Naruto hollered, door banging open. "We come bearing food!"</p><p>A lot of it, by the looks of things. Of course, with nine people including Naruto, Kiba and Chouji we needed <em> a lot </em> of food.</p><p>"What's with the atmosphere?" Sasuke asked, picking up on the heavy silence in the room. His dark eyes glanced over us all.</p><p>"I just told them about Orochimaru," I said as we set the food up to have a picnic in the middle of the floor.</p><p>"Is it true, Naruto?" Hinata asked timidly. "Did you really get attacked by him?"</p><p>"Ah, well, I wasn't there for most of it," he admitted. "But that's who they say he was." He waved his chopsticks vaguely in our direction. "But I ain't scared of no weird snake guy, that's for sure! Next time he shows his ugly face, I'll kick his ass!"</p><p>She pinked again and looked down. I could practically hear her thinking 'he's so brave'. Hinata really was a cute kid.</p><p>"Ne, Hinata," I asked carefully. "Do you think you could look at Sasuke's chakra for me later? I don't really know what Orochimaru did to poison him… but…"</p><p>She twisted her fingers in the hem of her jacket. "O-of course, but I don't know how much help I could be," she agreed quietly. "May-maybe Shino could help too?"</p><p>The Aburame <em> did</em> work closely with chakra, though most people didn't expect it, since they fed their own to their kikai instead of using it. But the mere fact that kikai ate chakra forced them to know more about it than the average ninja, particularly how things could affect chakra, and how that could affect their bugs.</p><p>"If you don't mind, Shino," I agreed.</p><p>Shino didn't have any objections, and after dinner had been cleared away we gathered around Sasuke to look at the curse mark.</p><p>"This is where he was bitten," I said, tracing my finger over the two puncture wounds in the curve of his neck. "And this mark must have formed shortly afterwards. I think it might be some sort of seal."</p><p>Hinata folded her hands into a seal and activated her Byakugan. She stared intently at his neck for a moment before speaking. "I… I can see it," she said softly. "There's a large mass underneath the mark itself and it's spreading further. Like… vines, or tendrils…" She trembled slightly. "The chakra is very … dark. Almost corrupted."</p><p>I blew out a sigh. "Okay. Can you tell how far it's gone?"</p><p>"Umm… It's definitely in the primary superficial subclavian chakra coil… maybe even the secondary subclavian coil. T-there are bits branching up the cervical coils… and towards the shoulder…"</p><p>So it was spreading pretty far, even without using it.</p><p>I bit my lip. "Maybe I can try and push it back, with my own chakra? Then we can see if we can block it off, stop it from spreading…"</p><p>Sasuke shifted. "Why do I get the feeling I'm about to be used as an experiment?" he asked.</p><p>"Hey, don't you trust us?" I asked weakly. "It's your choice, but… I really don't like this stuff… it can't be good for you."</p><p>"I know," he admitted quietly. "I don't like it either."</p><p>I straightened my shoulders and gathered my chakra, sliding it into his coils like I was doing medical jutsu.</p><p>Then jerked back and clamped a hand over my mouth and nose. "Grk!" I swallowed, convulsively, as my stomach tried to escape, an instinctive reaction to something so repulsive.</p><p>"Shikako?" Shikamaru asked warily, propping himself up on his shoulder from where he was lying on his bunk.</p><p>I waved my hand at him. "'m okay," I mumbled, breathing in deeply. "It just feels… really, really nasty."</p><p>"A rather extreme reaction," Shino noted.</p><p>"Hey, I'm a sensitive soul," I said, gathering myself to try again. This time, I resisted the instinctive urge to flinch away, battling through the nausea. It was easy, though, to tell which chakra was Sasuke's and which wasn't.</p><p>"It's moving back," Hinata confirmed quietly. Her hand reached out to trace a path against Sasuke's chest. "There's a branch of it down this way, towards the heart…"</p><p>The heart was pretty important in chakra production, containing the eighth chakra gate. Sasori had, after all, been able to function as a puppet with only his heart remaining.</p><p>"Ah, sorry! Sasuke-san!" Hinata jerked her hand back, flushing red and using an overly formal honorific to apologise.</p><p>"Don't worry about it," Sasuke said, uncomfortably.</p><p>I mostly ignored them as I focused on shunting the corrupted chakra back to one spot. It didn't <em> want</em> to be returned, and it kept trying to escape my grasp. It's purpose was to try and spread through the body, and that was what it kept trying to do. It wasn't <em> alive</em> exactly, but all chakra has a mental component to it.</p><p>"Shino?" I asked absently. "Do you think your kikai could target one kind of chakra and not another?"</p><p>Shino considered. I could hear his hive buzzing. "If the difference is as great as you implied, then yes, I suspect so," he said at length. "Do you wish for me to attempt to remove the … poisoned chakra?"</p><p>"I don't know," I confessed, frowning as I tried to contain it. "In a normal wound you would definitely attempt to draw out the poison before doing anything, so removing the excess chakra might make it weaker… but it might also stimulate it to produce more… I don't know enough to say."</p><p>"If there's a chance," Sasuke said. "You should try it."</p><p>Shino nodded. "A few at first, then. Hinata, if you will watch to see how it responds…"</p><p>"O-of course." She nodded.</p><p>A few kikai buzzed around the curse seal on Sasuke's neck. He flinched a little, but didn't react. Slowly, I felt the corrupted chakra drain, and I hastily tightened the net of my chakra holding it back.</p><p>"It seems to be weakening," I said. Hinata nodded in agreement. "It also seems that Sasuke's chakra is pushing it back a bit, too… it's just that after fighting so much…"</p><p>"My own chakra is depleted," he finished. "So if I keep using chakra… it will grow stronger." He didn't look happy with the thought. Well, if it was a permanent state, that was akin to being crippled or worse.</p><p>"Once the Exam is over we can get the medics to look at it or something," I said. "They'll probably know what to do better than we do…"</p><p>"Sorry," Hinata said timidly. "I wish I could do more…"</p><p>"It's… not your fault," Sasuke said. "I shouldn't have let myself get bitten in the first place."</p><p>I winced. There wasn't really much Sasuke could have done to stop <em> that</em> either.</p><p>"Ah, Hinata? Do you think it would be possible to put Jyuuken blocks in? The second I let go my chakra is just going to disperse."</p><p>She considered the question seriously. "Yes…. I can put chakra blocks in here and here… the chakra going to your arm will be weaker, but not completely stopped."</p><p>The chakra system was highly complex, with a lot of redundancies and double layers. There were about three or four different branches that lead into the arm, so blocking one wasn't going to immediately shut it down.</p><p>"Do it," Sasuke ordered firmly.</p><p>Hinata fingers stabbed into his shoulder sharply. I memorised the <em> solidity</em> of her chakra as it blocked off the pathways. The only other times I'd felt Jyuuken strikes, there had been too much <em> pain</em> associated with it to care about how it was done.</p><p>Sasuke hissed.</p><p>I copied the feel of her chakra as much I could, disengaging and drawing back. Most of it dissolved almost immediately. The Hyuuga probably underwent <em> a lot</em> of training to form their chakra like that in order to create plugs that wouldn't dissolve when contact was lost. Of course, even then they would be broken down naturally by the body in a matter of days.</p><p>I sighed. "That wont last forever," I said, flopping backwards. "How do you feel?"</p><p>Sasuke frowned and rotated his shoulder around. "Weird. Like there's something heavy attached to my neck." He paused. "Cleaner. I didn't realise… until it was gone…"</p><p>"It is unusual," Shino offered. "I have never heard of anything like this before." He was really disquieted by all of this. I guess they all were. It was hard to consider that while I had been terrified of it happening, they had all been blindsided by it. While I was just feeling relief that it was over, they were all still trying to come to terms with it happening at all.</p><p>"You guys are really kind of amazing," Naruto said. He'd been watching us all crowd around Sasuke with an odd look in his eyes. Naruto hadn't even seen Sasuke under the influence of the mark. Like Team 8, he only had second hand stories to go on.</p><p>"Thanks, Naruto," I said lethargically. Hinata practically <em> glowed</em> at the compliment. Even Shino looked pleased, if you looked closely enough. "How are you feeling? I think we should leave yours until we can get someone to look at it. Unless it gets worse," I amended.</p><p>He nodded vigorously. "No, I'm fine! Believe it!" He grinned a little too widely. Considering Orochimaru had hit him right over the Kyuubi seal, he probably didn't want anyone looking too closely.</p><p>Which coincidentally, was why I wasn't demanding to investigate it.</p><p>"Man, what a day," Shikamaru drawled.</p><p>I couldn't bring myself to disagree.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The end of the Exam took it's time in arriving. At first we were glad for the chance to rest after the hectic rush of the Forest, but boredom started to creep in. There wasn't much to do around the tower, and we tried to stay out of the way of the Sand team as much as possible.</p><p>Team Gai arrived late on the third day, but chose to bunk in one of the many other empty rooms. I was quietly glad about it, because every time he saw me Lee got twitchy and Neji was giving me considering looks that made me vaguely uncomfortable.</p><p>Team Kabuto squeaked in just before the test ended and there was a flash of surprise and anger across his face when he caught sight of us already at the tower.</p><p><em> Were you looking for us?</em> I wondered silently.</p><p>They called us to assemble on the afternoon of the fifth day. The room we assembled in was very large, with a small stage and a statue to one side of two hands in a seal, and two balconies running along the walls. The Hokage stood front and centre while the Exam proctors were arrayed beside him and our sensei aligned behind him.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei was there, with Gai and Kurenai and Asuma. Baki, the Sand Jounin, was there. And another. The Jounin was unfamiliar to me, a tall man with light brown hair, blue spandex drawn up around the sides of his face and square glasses. But his chakra… oh, his chakra…</p><p><em> Seems like someone wanted a front row seat…</em></p><p>Just having him there made me break out into a cold sweat. Not giving away that I knew… Not letting on … it took all my control.</p><p>"First of all," Anko said boldly. "Congratulations on finishing the Second Exam. Now pay attention. Hokage-sama is going to explain the Third Exam to you. You better listen carefully, maggots." She added the last bit as almost an afterthought, like she couldn't bear to let us go without insulting us one more time.</p><p>"First, before I tell you what the Third Exam entails, I want to explain about the test itself. Why do you suppose our country holds these exams in conjunction with our allies?" The Hokage asked rhetorically, puffing on his pipe.</p><p><em> Because our enemies wouldn't show up? </em> My snarky side wanted to interject. I squashed it. Firmly.</p><p>"To raise the ability levels of the shinobi and increase friendship between allied nations to be sure, but it's important that you understand it's true meaning. The exams are, so to speak, a representation of the battle between allied nations. If we look at our history, all the countries that we're currently allied with were once neighbouring nations that continuously fought with each other for power. In order to avoid destroying each others military strength meaninglessly those nations picked champions to do battle on behalf of their countries at a mutually selected location. That was how the Chunin Selection Examinations originally began. There is no doubt that part of these Exams is to select shinobi worthy of becoming Chunin, that's just not the whole story. These Exams also allow for a place where shinobi can carry the pride of their nation on their and fight against other ninja for their very lives."</p><p>He made it sound so…elegant. I resisted the urge to curl my lip in disgust. Like we were thinking about national <em> pride</em> when we were trying not to die.</p><p><em> Line up all your little soldiers, just to knock them down…</em></p><p>"Many leaders and people of prominence are invited from various countries to attend this exam as guests and also possibly to seek shinobi to work for them. This exam could determine the course of your ninja work from here on out. And more importantly, those rulers will watch your battles and take note of the skills that each ninja and each nation is developing. If there is a gap in power between countries, the strong nations are inundated with job requests for their ninja and conversely, requests to those deemed weak decline. Therefore, the stronger our nation is, the better our position when negotiating with neighbouring countries. So it's important to show how much military strength our village has."</p><p>That at least, I understood. We were advertising. We were promoting our nation as better than our competitors. It was a cruel heartless way of doing it, and I wondered if the benefit was worth the loss of life that resulted from it. I knew at least one Konoha team had died in the forest, probably more.</p><p>"This Exam is a chance for each nation to display the strength of its shinobi and thus the strength of the nation itself and it's because its an Exam where your life is on the line that it has meaning. And it's for this very reason and for the strength of the nation that your forerunners fought in this Exam. It's truly a dream worth striving for."</p><p>Ah, the 'it's traditional' excuse. It was better than outright war, yes, but 'better' didn't mean 'the best option'. And I didn't consider <em> that</em> a 'dream worth striving for'.</p><p>"Why did you say it was about 'international friendship' before, then?" Tenten demanded.</p><p>"This is a custom where balance is preserved by fighting and dying," the Hokage replied. "In the world of the shinobi, that <em> is</em> friendship."</p><p>Sometimes it was easy to forget that the Third Hokage was a war leader. This wasn't one of them. For all the complaints about Konoha being soft and the Third Hokage being peace-loving, this was still a brutal, militaristic, war torn place.</p><p>"The Third Exam is a fight for life, with the pride of your village and your own dreams at stake."</p><p>"The test is fine. Just tell me what the details of the Exam are, already. I can handle anything you throw at me," Gaara said, voice barely louder than a whisper. He was clearly getting impatient with all the speeches. I was and I had a fairly high tolerance for bullshit.</p><p>A ninja landed, kneeling, in front of the Hokage with a burst of Body Flicker speed. "Hokage-sama, before you do please allow me, Hayate Gekko, proctor of the Third Exam to speak first."</p><p>"So be it," the Hokage granted.</p><p>"It's nice to meet you all." Hayate coughed. "There's something I would like all of you to do before the Third Exam."</p><p>He looked <em> tired</em> , with dark bags etched deeply beneath his eyes.I wondered if his cough was a temporary condition or a pre-existing one. It was short and light, not the deep, phlegmmy cough of pneumonia or bronchitis. I couldn't see anyone being on active duty if they had that kind of illness, anyway.</p><p>"We have to have a preliminary exam before we can move on to the real one. This is the first time in five years that there have been enough candidates finishing the Second Exam to require one." He coughed again. That was going to get annoying.</p><p>"Preliminaries?" Shikamaru asked, sounding annoyed. "Just what do you mean by that?"</p><p>"The First and Second Exams might have been too easy," the proctor explained. "The fact is, we never expected so many of you to still be here. According to the rules of the Chunin Exams, a preliminary exam can be held at any stage in order to reduce the number of candidates remaining. It's just that, as Hokage-sama said, a lot of important guests will be watching; we can't afford to waste their time. They've come to see only the best. So if there are any of you that feel you are not in top physical condition, now's your chance to bow out. The preliminaries will be determined by one-on-one combat and they will be starting immediately."</p><p>Sasuke twitched. I could feel the sudden pulse of chakra radiating from his curse mark, trying to break down the blocks Hinata and I had installed. His hand clenched shut against the pain.</p><p>Against my will, my eyes darted towards the row of Jounin.</p><p><em> Orochimaru.</em></p><p>I reached forward, wrapping my fingers around Sasuke's wrist and channelling chakra up his arm, helping him fight the curse seal back down. Screw conserving energy for the Exam. This was more important. There would be no luck in convincing Sasuke to quit, so all I could do was help him on forwards.</p><p>"Okay, you got me. I'm out," Kabuto said, raising his hand, sheepishly. I didn't buy it for a second.</p><p>"Kabuto?" Naruto exclaimed. "What are you doing? You can't quit now!"</p><p>"I'm sorry, but my body is just too beat up," Kabuto said apologetically. "I just can't hack it."</p><p>Yeah, I didn't buy <em> that</em> either.</p><p>The proctor waited to see if anyone else was going to quit, then shrugged.</p><p>"Alright then. We will now begin the preliminary round. There are 17 of you remaining, so we will need eight matches and one of you will gain a pass. The surviving candidates from these matches will move on to the Third Exam. As for the rules, there are none. You will fight until one of you dies or concedes defeat or is rendered physically incapable of continuing. Naturally, those who are losing are encouraged to concede defeat to avoid a fatal outcome. Furthermore, as proctor, I'm given a certain amount of leeway in judging the matches. I might occasionally intervene if a match seems hopeless to save as many lives as possible."</p><p>Everyone was starting to look eager now that the Exam had been explained. Whether they <em> liked</em> it or not, we were about to fight, so everyone was slowly switching over into fight mode.</p><p>"The names of each pair of opponents are chosen completely at random," Hayate continued his spiel. "Before each match, these names will appear on the display behind me. In a moment, the names of the first two opponents will appear."</p><p>I didn't buy the 'random matchups' explanation. If I was in charge, I'd want only the strongest competitors to get through. That would mean making a list of presumed strength and pairing people off strongest to weakest. That way, the strongest half would win and the weakest half would be removed from the Exam.</p><p>It wasn't exactly fair, but what was?</p><p>The strongest - apparent - Genin in the room would be Gaara, based on basic information. He was the son of the 4th Kazekage and holder of the Ichibi. And, crucially, able to use it's power.</p><p>The weakest, again at first glance, would be Lee. A non-clan shinobi. Malformed chakra coils and unable to use ninjutsu or genjutsu? On paper he made the weakest shinobi in the group.</p><p>That he wasn't was a tribute to his hard work.</p><p>And since that was one of the matchups that I remembered clearly…</p><p>The board flashed and blinked before settling onto two names.</p><p><em> Sasuke Uchiha vs. Yoroi Akado</em></p><p>"They didn't waste any time," Sasuke muttered.</p><p>I drew in a deep breath and leaned closer. "Be careful. Stick to Taijutsu and weaponry. And, watch out… his chakra feels… hungry." I gave him a troubled look.</p><p>"I got it," he assured me, jaw clenching. "This is my fight now."</p><p>"Everyone other than the two opposing candidates will now clear the area and move to the upper level," the proctor ordered.</p><p>I pulsed my chakra one last time, helping Sasuke fight off the curse mark, before disengaging. Almost immediately, he clenched his fist shut in pain. He nodded at me, and I stepped away, heading for the stairs.</p><p>There was no more that I could do.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei meandered over to us, stopping briefly behind Sasuke. I enhanced my hearing so I could listen in on what he was saying.</p><p>"Sasuke," he greeted. "Don't use your Sharingan."</p><p>"So you know about it?" Sasuke said, not sounding at all surprised. Whether because he thought they <em> had</em> to have noticed Orochimaru, or because of the slightly irrational belief that Sensei would <em> always</em> know, I couldn't tell.</p><p>"If that mark on your neck gets out of control, your life could be in danger," Sensei warned.</p><p>"I'm aware of that."</p><p>"Just to let you know, if it gets to that point, I'll have to step in and stop the fight. Good luck." Kakashi-sensei's parting comment was slightly sardonic.</p><p>It was interesting how the groups had divided. Neither of the two platforms were any better than the other, running an equal distance along the walls on opposite sides of the room. And yet, one side held the Rookie Nine as well as Team Gai and the other held the Sand Team and the other member of Kabuto's team. It was like the battle lines were already drawn.</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei," I greeted as he leant on the railings beside me.</p><p>"You wont believe what the Forest was like," Naruto said, folding his arms.</p><p>Sensei chuckled. "I've heard a few stories," he said. "And it looks like you've had it rough."</p><p>I grimaced. "Yeah. We got a little banged up." I couldn't help but touch fingertips to the still roughed up surface of my cheek.</p><p>"It looks like it's healing fine," Kakashi-sensei assured me.</p><p>"That's good," I agreed, leaning forward and resting my forehead against his bicep. My hand curled around his wrist, fingers touching the inside pulse point, out of sight. "Otherwise I'd have to wear a mask like you, and then everyone will laugh at me."</p><p><em> Jounin. 30 degrees, 20 meters. Chakra is O-R-O-C-H-I-M-A-R-U. </em> I tapped out, my fingers moving the barest minimum distance to convey the message.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei gave a huffing laugh, even as his arm muscles tightened beneath my grip like steel cable. "Hey! I'm cool." He disengaged from me, hand going to my back to guide me away. "Asuma, tell her I'm cool."</p><p>Asuma-sensei was almost choking on his cigarette with laughter, and just casually glanced at Kakashi. I caught the fractional widening of his eyes when they fell on us. Whatever sign Sensei's hand was making on my back meant something.</p><p>"Well, I don't know," he stalled. "What do you think Kurenai?"</p><p>Kurenai chuckled. "I think Gai is the expert there, don't you?"</p><p>It was very neat, how they were managing to pass the signal along, hidden behind mockery, bringing everyone's attention to Kakashi-sensei without alerting the others. Very neat indeed.</p><p>"My Eternal Rival is indeed most hip and cool!" Gai enthused, even as he appeared behind us without a sound. "Though perhaps it would not be quite so appropriate for you to emulate him in such a fashion."</p><p>Naruto snickered. "Yeah that would just be too <em> weird.</em> "</p><p>I hummed in agreement, turning my attention back to the floor as Hayate called for the fight to begin. It opened with a few traditional volleys of kunai and shuriken with Sasuke definitely acting more wary than he normally would.</p><p>I could feel the pulsing of cursed chakra and knew that he was fighting a battle on two fronts. My hands clenched, white knuckled around the railing. Orochimaru was just <em> toying</em> with him.</p><p>But it wasn't until Yoroi started his chakra draining that I realised, with cold clarity, just how badly this fight could go.</p><p><em> He's draining your chakra… weakening your resistance against the curse seal… forcing you to draw on its power…</em></p><p>"Err…maybe you should let that go," Naruto said nervously, eyeing my hands as the torturous groan of metal filled the air.</p><p>I blinked and looked down. Then, finger by finger, forced my hands to let go of the railing. It was a little warped.</p><p>"Oops," I said sheepishly, calming my agitated chakra. It had snuck into my hands without me realising it, working off an unconscious desire to pummel someone.</p><p>"Sasuke will be fine," Naruto said. "He's too strong to let a guy like <em> that</em> beat him."</p><p>I think Kakashi-sensei was more surprised than I was. Naruto, admitting Sasuke was strong?</p><p>"Of course he will be," I agreed, just as, down below, Sasuke imitated the move that had led to Lee handing him his ass.</p><p>After that, it was game over.</p><p>"Winner; Sasuke Uchiha," Hayate announced.</p><p>"I'll be right back, kids. Asuma, could you…?" Sensei murmured.</p><p>"Yeah, I'll watch out for them," Asuma-sensei agreed. "You best get down there."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei hummed before Body Flickering down to stand behind Sasuke. They had a short conversation, as the medics came to take Yoroi away.</p><p>Sasuke glanced up at us. I smiled.</p><p>"Man, I hope Sensei knows how to get rid of that thing," Naruto said, as the two of them left. Yoroi's Jounin Sensei, the one I <em> knew</em> was Orochimaru in disguise, followed them out, presumably to check on his student but…</p><p>"Me too," I agreed.</p><p>"Let's move on to the second match," the proctor said quietly. The board flickered and eventually chose two more names.</p><p><em> Kankurou vs. Misumi Tsurugi</em></p><p>That was the other member of Kabuto's team. There was no Tsurugi clan in Konoha, nor an Akado one. They were both either orphans or from civilian families. That put their strength definitely at the bottom of the list.</p><p>Kankurou was definitely at the top. It was easy to see who would win this match. My brow furrowed as I tried to construct a list of who would be fighting who. It wasn't quite as straightforward as it seemed. There had been exceptions to the strongest vs. weakest rule, hadn't there?</p><p>The kunoichi had been mostly paired off against each other. Sakura vs. Ino and… Temari vs. Tenten? Yes. Because she had lost terribly.</p><p>Who had Hinata fought then?</p><p>My eyes cast around the room.</p><p><em> Neji.</em></p><p>That was right. Because she had lost terribly too.</p><p>After that it was easy to see who would be fighting who. Naruto was the trickiest. I didn't know where he should fall on the list. By rights, he should be at the top with Gaara, for much the same reasons, but those reasons were secret, and Naruto didn't have nearly the 'control' over his prisoner that Gaara did. If 'control' was the right word.</p><p>"Naruto," I said, voice low, so as not to let everyone overhear, "you'll probably be up against either Chouji or Kiba. Start planning."</p><p>He looked at me, wide eyed. He didn't question how I knew which was both good and bad. Good because it meant he trusted me, bad because it meant he wasn't trying to work it out himself.</p><p>"What should I do?" He asked voice hushed.</p><p>"How's your chakra?"</p><p>"It's a little weird," he confessed.</p><p>I bit my lip. "In normal circumstances I'd say 'turn it into a battle of attrition. A match of stamina. Just have them fighting clones until you exhaust them'. But if your chakra isn't working right… you might not be able to do that. Their fighting styles both rely on being able to move - momentum and spinning. Bog them down, tie them up… how's your supply of ninja wire?" Naruto didn't use ninja wire as much as Sasuke or I did, but being on our team meant he got a crash course in how great it could be.</p><p>Naruto started grinning madly. Life was about to get very unpleasant for somebody. "I know exactly what to do," he said.</p><p>"Because his opponent is unable to continue, the winner is Kankurou," Hayate said, calling the second match over.</p><p>I nodded thoughtfully. It hadn't taken long at all. A simple replacement technique to switch with his puppet, and Misumi had been trapped before he'd even noticed. It <em> was</em> impressive that Kankurou could control his puppet without being able to see what was going on. That was something to watch out for.</p><p>"The third match: Temari vs. Tenten!"</p><p>Tenten walked down the balcony behind us. I paused a second, considering. She hadn't been at the impromptu information gathering session before the first exam. And well… Konoha ninja should stick together.</p><p>"Be careful," I muttered loud enough for her to hear. "She's a wind type."</p><p>It was a bad, bad match up for her. But if she knew ahead of time… well, she might not lose so badly.</p><p>Her footsteps faltered briefly, and I knew she had heard me. I could only hope it helped.</p><p>The match started badly. Tenten opened with a frankly uninspired barrage of shuriken and was shaken when they missed. That was her first mistake, letting her opponent get to her. It was easy to see that Tenten didn't have the ability to analyse an opponents skills and then change her tactics on the fly. There was probably a reason she stuck to long range and let her team mates dictate strategy. But with prior warning, she did notice that her thrown weapons weren't getting through the shifting wind currents that Temari controlled and switched to Taijutsu, proving that Maito Gai trained no slackers.</p><p>Her Taijutsu skills were actually pretty good but Temari wasn't lacking there, either. She could use her fan as a bludgeon and easily use a wind blast to push her opponent back and escape. Temari wasn't exactly <em> pushed</em> but it wasn't the complete walkover it might have been.</p><p>"Winner; Temari!" Hayate called out, then coughed. Temari was smirking, leaning on her fan.</p><p>Chakra surged behind us, but a familiar pattern. He was back quickly.</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei!" Naruto exclaimed.</p><p>"Where's Sasuke?" I asked, tilting my head back to look at him. It was hard to tell, but Sensei looked a little disturbed.</p><p>"Oh, he's fine. Sleeping soundly in the infirmary. But he's been put under guard by the ANBU." That was actually a good thing, in my books. As long as the ANBU were there to keep Orochimaru away and not to make him a prisoner or anything. "Although…" Sensei hesitated. "When you were in the Forest… did Sasuke… did he… you were attacked by a team of Sound ninja, weren't you?"</p><p>How did he know about that? Sasuke could have told him, but if Sensei wanted to <em> ask</em> something about him, it was unlikely. The only other person would have been the one who sent them…</p><p>Orochimaru…</p><p>… who had left the examination room shortly after Kakashi-sensei and Sasuke.</p><p>"Yeah, we were," I confirmed.</p><p>Sensei looked at me directly. "Did Sasuke kill them?"</p><p>"No," I said honestly, flatly. Some of the tension drained out of his frame and I turned away. "I did."</p><p>Orochimaru, who had sent them. Who had apparently discovered that they had been killed. Had he made the assumption that Sasuke had done it? That the curse mark was doing its job? Was that a good thing or a bad thing?</p><p>There was a careful silence on the balcony. I didn't kid myself into thinking that the other Jounin hadn't heard our conversation.</p><p>"Man, this test is such a drag," Shikamaru droned. Whether he'd done it on purpose or not, I was grateful all the same.</p><p>"Next match," Hayate called. "Inuzuka Kiba verses Naruto Uzumaki!"</p><p>"Finally! A chance to show what I've got!" Naruto shouted excitedly.</p><p>"Yeah! Hey Akamaru, I think you and I won the lottery! This is going to be cake." Kiba grinned, making his way towards the stairs.</p><p>Akamaru barked in agreement.</p><p>"Heh. He's going to be surprised," Naruto boasted, before holding up a familiar canteen. "Mind if I borrow this?" he asked.</p><p>I blinked, and glanced towards my backpack where it was leaning against the wall. "Sure," I agreed readily enough, not <em> quite</em> sure what he wanted with it. He already had his own attached to belt. "Help yourself."</p><p>"Sorry Kiba," Naruto said as they squared off on the floor. "Don't take it personally if I blow you away."</p><p>"That's just what I was going to say! Only not so politely," Kiba growled back. "Right Akamaru?"</p><p>"When you're ready," Hayate said, moving back out of the way. "Begin!"</p><p>"Beast Mimicry: Four Legs Jutsu." Kiba's chakra <em> spiked</em> and he crouched down onto hands and feet. It was hard to see from such a distance, but he looked far more feral than before. "Here I come!"</p><p>His speed was now comparable to Sasuke's or maybe mine when enhanced, I suspected, though it was hard to measure for sure. This was the Inuzuka Taijutsu. Feral and wild and very different from how humans normally fought. It was difficult to predict simply for that reason.</p><p>It also used chakra to a large degree, meaning that it was pretty draining and I suspected Kiba would only be able to use it for short bursts. Though, if he got some good hits in, that might be all he needed.</p><p>"Who do you think will be victorious?" Shino asked, glancing side on at me. Hinata clutched the railings and peered down anxiously at the two fighters.</p><p>I hmmed. "How likely is Kiba to take Naruto seriously?" It looked like he wasn't really messing around that much, going straight into his family techniques.</p><p>"More so than before the Forest, that's for sure," Shika said, leaning on the railings. "Man, I wouldn't even want to face him now."</p><p>"The more seriously Kiba takes him, the better chance he has," I said. "But…" I shrugged. "I'd be a poor team mate if I didn't back Naruto, ne?"</p><p>"As would I," Shino acknowledged quietly. "Kiba is not a push over."</p><p>"Neither is Naruto. Not anymore." I shivered, just a little. "But neither of them will be using life or death techniques. It isn't that sort of fight."</p><p>Naruto wouldn't be pushed to using Kyuubi chakra. If he could even use it now… Of course, he could still do plenty of damage without it.</p><p>I watched idly as Kiba threw down some smoke bombs and attacked while sight was screened. I followed the fight with my chakra sense as Naruto started moving to try avoid Kiba's attacks. It wasn't completely successful, but it was a good effort, and he nearly cleared the smoke before Akamaru tackled him back into it.</p><p>There was silence, then Kiba leapt clear of the smoke, eyeing it warily. It started to clear, slowly, revealing an orange body huddled on the ground.</p><p>'Akamaru' sprinted out of the smoke cloud, back towards his partner.</p><p>"Yeah! Way to go Akamaru," Kiba cheered, crouching down to pick him up. "This fight is over!"</p><p>Then 'Akamaru' bit him.</p><p>It was hard to say who was more shocked, the crowd, or Kiba.</p><p>"Idiot," I mumbled. "If you were going to bite him, you should have bitten him somewhere it would matter." It was only on the arm, and his thick jacket pretty much negated the whole effect of it.</p><p>"Surprise!" Naruto said, releasing the Transformation Jutsu with a cloud of smoke. Kiba shook him off and he backed up spitting.</p><p>"What? Where's Akamaru?" Kiba asked. There was real worry in his voice.</p><p>The Naruto that had been lying on the ground, stood, holding Akamaru by his front paws. Akamaru whined in shame.</p><p>"Wow," Ino said. "Is that really Naruto? Who would have thought that Naruto would be a match for Kiba?"</p><p>"To balance a Transformation Jutsu and a Clone Jutsu at the same time?" Shika commented. "That's kinda impressive. There's no way he should be able to do that."</p><p>I blinked. Actually, it was. Now that I thought about it… I was still working on being able to do two jutsu at the same time. But Naruto played Shadow Clone Shogi with me… huh. I'd never even recognised that …</p><p>"Whaddaya know?" Kiba said, grinning in feral relief. "Got a little stronger, I see. But not nearly strong enough because now I'm going to get serious."</p><p>"Good, I was hoping you would because I want to <em> seriously</em> knock you out," Naruto shot back.</p><p>I really wanted to tell him to stop playing around.</p><p>"Naruto, if I were you, I'd let Akamaru go." Kiba reached into his kunai pouch and pulled out something tiny. He flicked it towards Akamaru who swallowed it.</p><p>Akamaru's chakra blossomed and he began to grow. Larger and heavier, fur turning a dark red as he started to <em> growl. </em> He broke free of Naruto's grasp easily, dispersing the clone.</p><p>"What the heck happened? What was that thing you just fed him? Why did all his fur just turn red?" Naruto asked, puzzled.</p><p>"Are you sure you want to stick around to find out?" Kiba taunted, swallowing something himself. His chakra almost doubled. Soldier pills. No doubt about it.</p><p>"Beast Mimicry: Beast Human Clone!"</p><p>The two of them changed, Kiba becoming even more feral than before. Akamaru was his matching double.</p><p>"We'll take you down in one hit!" Kiba said. The two of them leapt forward and then began to spin. "Fang Over Fang!"</p><p>The two of them rotated until it was like they were inside a drill - or a tornado.</p><p><em> Interesting. They really are taking Naruto seriously to be using that already.</em></p><p>Naruto seemed to recognise that he didn't want to hit by that. I felt the surge in chakra of a Replacement Technique just before Kiba hit, leaving behind a chakra construct shaped like a scarecrow (complete with X's for eyes and a sticking out tongue) behind.</p><p>"Okay, so is it my turn now?" Naruto asked, mockingly, from the other side of the room. Kiba and Akamaru spun around in shock to face him.</p><p>Naruto was weighing the two water canteens in his hands, and with a casual flick he popped off the lids and threw them halfway across the room.</p><p>"Hidden in the Mist Jutsu!" He called, hands flying through the seals. His chakra spiked and <em> poured </em> out. That was much, much more chakra than he normally used for that jutsu, but the mist came out thick. It covered almost the whole room, with only the barest amount of clear space around the walls. I remembered that he had had problems in the Forest…</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei," I muttered. "Orochimaru did something to Naruto's chakra system." I described the jutsu that he had used, as much as I had seen of it, and exactly <em> where</em> he had been hit. "It's been causing problems with his chakra control since…"</p><p>Sensei's eye was slightly wider than normal. "I'll get someone to look at it, after the preliminaries."</p><p>"Urg!" Naruto's voice came echoing from inside the mist. "Smells like wet dog."</p><p>"Why you-!" There was an incoherent sound of pure rage. "You think this is going to stop me? I can still smell you, you know!"</p><p>A Naruto landed on the wall, then another, and another. There were dozens of them, up the walls, over the ceiling, crouched on the balcony and rails. And all of them appeared to be holding … wire.</p><p>Inside the mist it must have been like a cats cradle.</p><p>"Fang Over Fang!" Kiba shouted again.</p><p>Several of the Naruto's were yanked forwards, then a few more, then others grunted and pulled backwards. Rather like they were fishermen reeling in a large one.</p><p>"Hey! What the-!"</p><p>One Naruto jumped backwards out of the mist, standing in the tiny space clear of the mist. His face was very focused as he worked though a set of hand seals. "Alright! Eat this, Kiba! Lightning Release: Radiating Shockwave!"</p><p>It blasted out of him, scorching his hands from jutsu overload, but dancing through the mist. There were points where it sparked up impossibly bright - probably from the metal of ninja wire - and the clones all began to explode as the lightning was channelled down the wire into them.</p><p>Radiating Shockwave wasn't a huge jutsu, or a particularly long range one. As the name suggested, it produced a wide wave of lightning that arced around the user. Using the mist and ninja wire to increase it's range into an area of effect jutsu was a pretty clever combination.</p><p>"Kiba is down," I said, feeling his chakra stutter. Lightning jutsu often had the 'side effect' of paralysing the victim, and Kiba and Akamaru had basically taken that one full force.</p><p>Naruto was panting, but didn't look particularly wounded or tired. The mist started to fade, creating puddles of water on the floor. That would be something to watch out for in later fights. Wet floors were often slippery.</p><p>Kiba was tangled in lengths of ninja wire, twitching sporadically. Akamaru had dropped out of the clone jutsu and was back to being a small white puppy. But he was out of it too.</p><p>"Kiba Inuzuka is unable to continue. Winner is Naruto Uzumaki."</p><p>I cheered.</p><p>"That was surprising," Chouji said. "It's hard to think that that's the same Naruto…"</p><p>"Not that surprising," I said. "It's been a hard couple of months."</p><p>I bumped shoulders with Naruto as he rejoined us. "Did you see that?" he exclaimed. "Was I awesome or what?"</p><p>"Way to go," I congratulated. "Kiba was a tough opponent, you know."</p><p>"We're all really surprised," Ino said. "You're not the same kid from the Academy, anymore."</p><p>"No way! And you better believe it!" He grinned at her.</p><p>"Next match," Hayate called, catching our attention again. "Shino Aburame vs. Chouji Akimichi."</p><p>"Good luck, Chouji, Shino," I said as they both made their way downstairs. They both nodded at each other, perfectly polite.</p><p>Without name calling to enrage him, Chouji wasn't an aggressive soul - even though Asuma-sensei had bribed him with barbeque. And while Shino was perfectly willing to indulge in battle based trash talk, commenting on someone's appearance was beneath him. He much preferred to state why his opponents skill set was below his and why that meant they were going to lose.</p><p>It was actually an interesting match up. Akimichi naturally had large chakra reserves, quite apart from their stored 'excess', in order to use their Expansion Techniques. That meant that Shino's kikai had a long way to go in order to drain Chouji's chakra. Added to that, the spin of the Human Bullet Tank prevented them from gaining much of a foothold. But Shino wasn't ruffled at all and was easily able to dodge the not-very-accurate rolling sphere. Without someone to slow his target for him, Chouji simply couldn't hit it.</p><p>In the end, Shino's slow and persistent method of increasing the number of kikai on Chouji depleted his chakra until he could no longer use jutsu.</p><p>It was an almost anticlimactic fight, even though both of them gave it their best efforts.</p><p>"Winner; Shino Aburame," the proctor announced.</p><p>"Well, it was a good effort, Chouji," Asuma-sensei said, laying a hand on his shoulder. "Maybe next time."</p><p>"The next match will be," Hayate announced. "Shikamaru Nara vs. Shikako Nara."</p><p>I'd almost expected that, but it was still a punch in the gut.</p><p>If the Finals were to promote the village, they would want to show variety. Having two members from the same family would just be boring, particularly when Nara weren't known for our exciting combat styles.</p><p>I glanced at Shikamaru.</p><p>His grip was white knuckled on the railing.</p><p><em> Are you… afraid of me, Shikamaru?</em></p><p>The thought made me unbearably sad. It sat in the pit of my stomach like a heavy stone, closed my throat off, ached behind my eyes.</p><p>"Troublesome," he muttered.</p><p>My thoughts raced. We could fight. Given how unmotivated Shikamaru was, I might even win. Of course, given how good Shika was at out manoeuvring people, the match might go in his favour. It was tough to say.</p><p>"I forfeit," I said, voice barely loud enough to be heard by the proctor.</p><p>Shikamaru looked over at me and sighed. "You really want to do that?" he asked.</p><p>I nodded. "I forfeit," I repeated louder, voice surer.</p><p>"What's the point in that?" Temari scoffed from across the room, leaning on the rail, all casual arrogance. "Hanging in here to forfeit now?"</p><p>I shrugged. "There are two people in this room that I would forfeit rather than fight. My brother just happens to be one of them."</p><p><em> Your brother is the other,</em> went unsaid.</p><p>Naruto looked scandalised. "You cant do that!" he protested. "Why are you just giving up? You used to kick his ass all the time at the academy!"</p><p>"Think about it," I said lowly to him, as the Proctor announced Shikamaru as the winner. It wasn't quiet enough to prevent those around me from hearing, but since it was only my team and team ten, I didn't think that was an issue. "Everyone here is watching. When it comes to the finals, they're going to have no idea how Shikamaru fights. That'll give him the advantage."</p><p>"You still could have won," Naruto argued stubbornly.</p><p>"Maybe," I said. "Maybe not. But he's my brother. A promotion… that's not a good enough reason to fight him." There might have been something approving about the glint in Kakashi's eye, but I could have been imagining it.</p><p>That made him pause. Naruto didn't have family, but he regarded his friends highly. Of course, to him, not fighting them would have been more insulting, but he did understand in a way. "I guess."</p><p>"Besides," I continued. "If I forfeited, that just means the Shika <em> has</em> to become Chunin."</p><p>"Troublesome," my brother muttered. "You had a better chance of getting through the Finals than me."</p><p>"If you're really torn up about it, you can do my chores for me," I suggested.</p><p>"Not a chance," Shikamaru snorted.</p><p>The next fight was where things started to get miserable. I wasn't pleased with having to forfeit, but it wasn't the end of the world. Not for me.</p><p><em> Hinata Hyuuga vs. Neji Hyuuga</em></p><p>Watching Hinata and Neji fight was painful. Not just with the explosive discharges of chakra as their Jyuuken strikes clashed, but emotionally as well. I wanted to tell Hinata to forfeit, but at the same time I wanted to encourage her to stand up for herself. I wanted to tell her she was strong and didn't have to listen to him discourage her.</p><p>I wanted to stop him hurting her.</p><p>But…</p><p>But Hinata kept standing up.</p><p>"You're wrong, Neji-nii-san," she said, her voice carrying quiet conviction. "Because these eyes… can see that the one suffering here is you."</p><p>Because <em> Hinata</em> thought it was worth it.</p><p>It wasn't about the match. It wasn't about the Exam anymore. It was about standing up to prove she could.</p><p>I swallowed, my throat thick and bitter.</p><p>"Hinata," Naruto said, when she had to be carried off the floor on a stretcher, a growl in his voice. "I promise, I will <em> prove</em> that people can change. I will <em> beat </em> Neji in your name."</p><p>"Hmph." Neji snorted, unimpressed. "A failure will always be a failure."</p><p>But if watching Neji and Hinata was hard then watching Lee and Gaara was worse. Because, like Sasuke, Lee would never quit. And Gaara would never be pacified.</p><p>I didn't want to watch. But I had to. If Gaara gave away anything that could help beat him… I had to see it.</p><p>Lee was <em> impressive</em> once the weights came off. But it wasn't enough. Then he started opening the gates.</p><p>The explosion of chakra as the limiters released made my breath catch in my throat. There was so much chakra it was visible. And yet, watching what it was doing to him made me glad that I had never pushed myself that far.</p><p>And it <em> still</em> wasn't enough. He gave too much, too fast and his body couldn't handle the strain.</p><p>Like Hinata, Lee had to be carried out on a stretcher too. But Gaara walked off the floor under his own power.</p><p>"And with that match, the Third Exam preliminaries are now finished." The proctor coughed once more before calling all the winners - and Ino, who hadn't fought - down to the floor.</p><p>The Hokage stepped forward. "In the Third Exam you will all put your battle skills on display. You will demonstrate the power and control you have achieved in your respective disciplines. Accordingly, the Third Exam will be held one month from now in order to provide a suitable period of preparation. So now, all that remains to be done is to find out who your opponents will be."</p><p>"Everyone," Anko said, holding up a box and moving down the line. "Take one piece of paper and tell us the number written on it. Ibiki will draw up a sheet of matches."</p><p><em> Naruto vs. Neji</em></p><p><em> Sasuke vs. Gaara</em></p><p><em> Ino vs. Temari</em></p><p><em> Shino vs. Shikamaru</em></p><p><em> Kankurou </em></p><p>I stared at the matchups. That was … familiar.</p><p>Well. If they rigged the prelims, why wouldn't they rig the actual matches? There were bound to be ways to ensure Genin picked the right numbers. Naruto had already declared a grudge match against Neji - which was bound to provide interesting motivation - and everyone wanted to see Sasuke fight Gaara. Ino and Temari fought it off as the two Kunoichi to make it through. Shino, Shikamaru and Kankurou were all the more long distance, strategic fighters. Pitting them all against each other made sense.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Urgh. This just kept getting longer and longer. Not really that happy with this chapter.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Break: Chapter 25</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: So we begin the training month. This is probably going to take a few chapters, so don't get all upset now. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 25</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster. ~ Sun Tzu</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The hospital was dark and mostly silent, but I awoke easily, sliding into wakefulness between one breath and the next. There was a dark shadow looming over me.</p><p>"Been working overtime?" I asked, levering myself to sit up. The medics had knit my bones back together, but they were still soft and would easily rebreak. It would be at least a week before I'd be combat ready, though admittedly that was much sooner than the <em> normal</em> time frame for a broken bone to heal.</p><p>Dad jerked. In the low light, I could barely see him, but he looked tired. "Sorry, pet. Didn't mean to wake you." There was something in his hands and I squinted, making out the shape of a clipboard.</p><p>"It's just a broken arm and fractured ribs," I said, guessing what he was looking at. My medical report was missing from the slot on the foot of the bed.</p><p>"And this?" he asked, tapping the bandages taped to the side of my face.</p><p>"Just a scrape," I said. "The medics feel like they have to bandage <em> everything</em> . I wont even end up with cool scars like yours."</p><p>He snorted. "You're far too young and pretty for that."</p><p>Mum had fussed much more when she had been here earlier but Shika had told me about the look on her face when he'd shown up at home alone, so I hadn't protested.</p><p>"Do you know what happened?" I asked. "In the Forest?"</p><p>He hummed. "I've been working on it," he acknowledged. Which was probably as much information I was going to get about how much they knew about Orochimaru and what they were doing about it. "I was going to get you to give a report tomorrow."</p><p>"I can give it to you now," I offered. "Verbally, anyway. I haven't got anything written up yet."</p><p>"That's fine," he said, dragging a chair over to the side of the bed. "When you're ready."</p><p>I took a moment to organise my thoughts. Then I began to speak. I recounted our movements in the Forest of Death and gave our approximate position when we had been confronted by Orochimaru posing as a Grass ninja. I listed the attacks that had been made, what I could remember of what he said to us, and how we had responded. I mentioned that Naruto and I had been knocked out and continued with the second hand information we had been given by Sasuke. I wanted to skim over the fight with the Sound team, but didn't because they had <em> admitted</em> to being sent by Orochimaru and anything that tied him to the Village Hidden in the Sound was important. I told him about the power of the curse mark and what we'd done at the tower to try and mitigate it. That got a raised eyebrow. I even mentioned sensing Orochimaru posing as one of the Jounin at the preliminaries, how he had left after Sasuke had fought and what Kakashi-sensei had asked and my theory about how he had known to ask.</p><p>"I have Jounin that can't give reports that detailed," Dad said with a wry quirk to his lips when I'd finished.</p><p>I shrugged. "Can you tell me anything?"</p><p>"Not really," he replied. "We don't really <em> have</em> much information. We know he was here, and that he was after the Uchiha but the ANBU sent after him haven't returned."</p><p>Dead, hovered unsaid. ANBU didn't <em> skip</em> reporting in.</p><p>"Does mum know? That we got attacked, I mean," I asked, picking at my blankets. It hadn't seemed like she had and I hadn't wanted to bring it up…</p><p>"No, she doesn't," Dad said levelly. "We've been keeping his presence here quiet. It's the kind of thing that causes panic… or sets people out looking for revenge. The fewer people who know…"</p><p>There would be quite a few people in Konoha that had something against Orochimaru. More who despised traitors on principle.</p><p>"I see," I said. "Team 10 and Team 8 know. We told them." I shrugged. "I don't know who they've told."</p><p>Dad sighed. "It can't be helped. But for now… try not to bring it up, alright?"</p><p>I nodded. Well, if Mum asked I could always just say Dad told me not to tell. Then he could deal with her.</p><p>"Wicked imp," he muttered, a knowing glint in his eye.</p><p>I gave him my best innocent face.</p><p>He snorted, clearly not buying it. Then his face shifted into seriousness again. "How have you been holding up?"</p><p>"I don't know," I said quietly, looking away. A lifetimes worth of 'thou shalt not kill' warring with a decade of life as the daughter of a ninja clan… logical 'they threatened to kill us' against 'did I really <em> have</em> to?'… "Everyone keeps <em> looking </em> at me…"</p><p>"You're probably the first of your friends to take this step," Dad said. "They don't understand yet and they're looking to you to see how you handle it."</p><p>"I know. It's just…" I struggled to put words to it. "How am I supposed to feel about it? With everything else that happened… its such a small thing…"</p><p>"You feel about it however you feel about it," he said gently. "No one can tell you that you're right or wrong to feel that way. But you can't change what happened either; its too late for that now."</p><p>I nodded. "Was it the right choice?" I asked.</p><p>He considered it. "I can't tell you that. The life of a ninja is a hard one, with hard decisions that have to be made. We might not always make the right choices, but we learn from them regardless. And sometimes, the choice we <em> must</em> make isn't one we like, or sometimes none of the options are happy ones. Only you can tell if the decision you made was the right one."</p><p>I fidgeted with the sheets, my fingers twisting around and around. "I wish they hadn't attacked us," I confessed. "But… I don't feel guilty. I don't… <em> regret</em> it."</p><p>They were going to kill us. I <em> couldn't</em> regret it. And if that made me a bad person then so be it. It frightened me, just a little, that I could be so callous.</p><p>"It's something that every ninja has to face at one point or another," Dad said, and there was no <em> judgement</em> in his voice.</p><p>I leant backwards and sighed. It might not have been the most conventionally reassuring conversation but… it helped. The silence reigned for a moment before I spoke again. "You better go home or Mum will start to worry about you too."</p><p>He quirked a smile and pressed a kiss to my forehead. "We can't be having that," he agreed. "Sleep tight."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Kakashi-sensei showed up the next morning while I was gathering my things to sign out. He didn't even say anything, just lounged about reading his book, like it was a perfect coincidence we were even in the same place. I might have even bought it too, if, y'know, we hadn't been in my hospital room.</p><p>"Sensei?" I asked uncertainly.</p><p>"Hmm?" He looked at me over the top of his book. "Did you want something?"</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "Did you come here for a reason?"</p><p>"Ma, two of my cute little students are in the hospital. I had to come and see how they were doing." He smiled, eye crinkling happily.</p><p>"You've been to see Sasuke? How is he?" I asked eagerly, picking up on the implication.</p><p>"Ah, well. They're not letting visitors in to see him," he explained. That didn't, necessarily, mean he hadn't been there. There wasn't <em> that</em> much hospital security could do to keep a Jounin out as evidenced by Dad seeing me outside of normal visiting hours.</p><p>I looked at him expectantly.</p><p>"He's fine," Sensei said, caving. "We were just planning a little training trip for the next month."</p><p>"Trip?" I repeated, suddenly feeling a lot less enthusiastic. Wait, wasn't this when Sasuke had been taught Chidori? "To where?"</p><p>"Oh, not far. Just past the outskirts, probably. This isn't really training you want to be doing in the middle of the village."</p><p>And it'd keep Sasuke isolated. Just in case.</p><p>I bit my lip. Somehow, removing Sasuke from all social contact except Kakashi-sensei for a whole month <em> didn't</em> seem like a good idea to me. "Where abouts?"</p><p>His one eye narrowed. "Why all the questions?"</p><p>"So I can find you," I admitted. It looked like he was about to deny me, so I rushed onwards. "I can bring food. Supplies. And if Sasuke needs a sparring partner I'm plenty fast when I want to be!"</p><p>He blinked. "Fast…? How did you-" He cut himself off.</p><p>"Err," I stammered. "Since Lee exposed the weakness of Gaara's Sand Defence in regards to speed then I figured you were going to train Sasuke to take advantage of that… or ways to slow it down more, I guess. Was I wrong?"</p><p>"No. No, you weren't wrong." He sighed. "I'll let you know before we leave."</p><p>I nodded, satisfied. Even if he didn't there were only so many places they could go; I'd find them eventually. Close to Konoha, large enough to camp and train, away from the main routes of travel… I was already crossing out large sections of the map in my head.</p><p>"Cool," I said, picking up the vase of flowers from the table beside the bed. Honeysuckle, baby's breath and gladiolus, probably picked from our front garden as Mum ran out the door. Sweetness, happiness and strength of character. And there was a sprig of snapdragon nestled snugly in the middle because it was my favourite flower even though - or maybe because - it meant deception.</p><p>Come on, it was called <em> snapdragon. </em> How cool was that?</p><p>Sensei followed me out to the reception desk, looking for all the world like we just <em> happened</em> to be walking in the same direction.</p><p>We heard Naruto before we saw him.</p><p>"Sorry, no visitors."</p><p>"Ah! Are you kidding me?" Naruto shouted. I cringed. Jeeze, he was loud.</p><p>"Those are the rules," the receptionist chirped, not sounding very sorry at all.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei sighed. "Naruto, this is a hospital, keep it down."</p><p>Naruto spun around to face us. "Kakashi-sensei! Shikako! You're okay!"</p><p>The exclamation marks practically bounced off the tiled floor.</p><p>"Yup," I said, slipping past him to hand my release forms to the receptionist. Good thing I'd already filled them out. "As of now, I'm officially out of hospital."</p><p>"That's great! I was coming to visit you guys but they wouldn't let me in." He scowled at the receptionist who just smiled pleasantly back.</p><p>"Sasuke's in the part of the hospital where they don't let visitors," I explained, bumping shoulders with him lightly. "Can you just imagine how many of his fan girls would have shown up?"</p><p>Naruto sniggered, probably thinking about how annoyed Sasuke would be at being unable to escape them. "Anyway, Kakashi-sensei, I have a favour to ask you."</p><p>"Stop right there," Sensei said holding up his hands. "I already know what you're going to ask. So I've been looking for someone that can oversee your training for the final rounds."</p><p>"Hold on!" Naruto protested immediately. "Why can't you train me, Sensei?"</p><p>"I have other matters to handle. I don't have time to deal with you Naruto." I felt like slapping my face. Seriously, Sensei? Did you <em> really</em> think that was a good thing to say?</p><p>"Hey! You're going to train Sasuke, aren't you Kakashi-sensei?" There wasn't just annoyance in his voice now, there was the barest traces of hurt.</p><p>"Now, now, don't complain. Listen, I found you an even better teacher than me." Sensei smiled cheerfully.</p><p>"Well, who is it?" Naruto pouted, crossing his arms.</p><p>"It is I."</p><p>Ebisu. A clanless ninja who made Special Jounin at twenty two years of age solely on his mastery of basic and generalised ninja skills. Without a defining and powerful technique or jutsu set he'd probably never make the jump to full Jounin, but he was a crafty and tricky ninja who used high levels of strategy to employ his abilities to their fullest level.</p><p>I wondered why he and Kakashi-sensei had chosen to meet at the hospital, then I realised that by the time you made Special Jounin you probably realised that letting Sensei set a meeting place was a bad idea. Because a meeting place implied a meeting <em> time</em> and Sensei wasn't very good at those. Easier just to hunt him down.</p><p>"You!" Naruto shouted, pointing at him.</p><p>They knew each other? Wait. Ebisu was currently teaching Konohamaru. Naruto and Konohamaru <em> did</em> know each other, so it was likely that the two of them had run into each other before. And Naruto didn't always make great first impressions.</p><p>"Such insolence." Ebisu sniffed.</p><p>"You're kidding me! Of all the guys you could have picked you picked this guy to train me! He's weaker than I am!"</p><p>Okay, I think I needed to step in. I'd never really considered myself much of a peacemaker, but around Naruto I sometimes felt the urge. Just to stop him from <em> yelling</em> so much.</p><p>"Ne, Naruto," I began. "Ebisu-sensei was promoted to Special Jounin on the merits of his teaching skills and strategising ability alone."</p><p>"That's right," Kakashi-sensei echoed. "He's a private tutor who only trains the elite. Frankly, he's a better teacher than I am."</p><p>"So he's pretty smart," I continued, sort of ignoring Sensei's interjection. "He'd be able to help you come up with a plan for fighting Neji."</p><p>Naruto's surly look faded, just a little. "Why can't you help me?" he argued.</p><p>"I can, of course," I said, soothingly. "But if one plan is good, then two plans are better, right? And I'm going to be helping Shikamaru and Ino and Sasuke, too. So you want some one who can help you more often, right?"</p><p>He nodded, barely.</p><p>"Right." So he was almost convinced. Now to set him a task to do so he'd forget he wanted to argue more. "Maybe you should talk to Hinata about how Neji fights, if you're going to be trying to avenge her. I'm sure she'd be willing to talk to you. Even if she lost, they have the same fighting style, the Hyuuga Jyuuken. She might have some advice and I'm sure Ebisu-sensei can help you decide what questions you need to ask her."</p><p>Ebisu pushed his glasses up his nose. "A very intelligent plan, young Nara," he said. "Knowing one's enemy is paramount for success."</p><p>Naruto mostly ignored him. "Yeah," he said quietly. "I should talk to her." His fist clenched. "She didn't deserve that."</p><p>I plucked the snapdragon from my bouquet and held them out to him. "Here. You should give her these. She's probably going to be in the hospital for a while, so it'd be nice if she had some flowers."</p><p>He took them gingerly, very much a pre-teen boy faced with flowers. "Umm, right. Lets go!" He marched off into the corridors, flowers held out at arms length in front of him.</p><p>I stared after him, bemused. "Do you even know what room she's in?"</p><p>Ebisu groaned. Naruto froze, then turned around with a sheepish look on his face.</p><p>I sighed. "Ask the receptionist. Now, don't forget to use your Shadow Clones during training and I'll see you for lunch tomorrow?"</p><p>"At Ichiraku!" Naruto nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>I waved goodbye, noting vaguely that Sensei had already vanished, and stepped out of the hospital, basking in the fresh air and sunshine. I twirled my snapdragon through my fingers before tucking in neatly into the loops of my braid.</p><p>It was a lovely day.</p><p>I meandered slowly back home. Even though I hadn't made the Finals, that didn't mean I was going to slack off on my training, because the day of the Third Exam was also the day of the invasion. Knowing that, I probably had more motivation to train than my peers.</p><p>Physical training would have to wait until my ribs were well and truly healed, but there were other things I could do.</p><p>There was no one home when I got there, and I spent most of the morning cleaning my ninja gear and restocking my mission pack anyway. It was unlikely that I'd get a mission before the Finals, but I technically wasn't involved in them, so it was possible. It made me feel better to have it ready, anyway.</p><p>At lunchtime, I cast an uninspired eye around the kitchen and decided to go out for lunch. Maybe I'd go see Sakura and hope I caught her on her lunch break.</p><p>I headed towards the Haruno household, but as I was passing the Yamanaka Flower Shop I was nearly tackled and dragged inside.</p><p>"You've got to help me!" Ino said, grabbing me by the shoulders. "I'm going to get crushed out there!"</p><p>My head wobbled back and forth as she shook me. I clamped my hands down on her wrists to stop her.</p><p>"Ino!"</p><p>"Did you see Temari? I can't fight like that! What am I going to do?" She babbled. I took a moment to look at her. Ino looked terrible. Drawn and frazzled. "I'm going to get <em> killed.</em> "</p><p>I didn't bother asking why she was at the Flower Shop instead of training, if she was so worried. The Yamanaka Flower Shop was practically Ino's second home and it had a very calming atmosphere inside with the numerous flowers everywhere. It was a good place to think and there was always more work to be done inside.</p><p>"Ino!" I repeated. This time she listened. "Calm down. You've got a month to work things out. Have you talked to your dad?"</p><p>She blinked and breathed in deeply. "No, not yet. What could I <em> say?</em> 'Sorry, I'm going to embarrass us all'?"</p><p>"How about 'Dad, I made it to the Third Exam, could you please help me train'?" I suggested wryly.</p><p>She flushed.</p><p>It was a logical first step. Inoichi was still the master of their family style, even if he didn't teach her any new techniques, which I doubted he would, frankly. Like our family style, there was only so fast you could progress. I wasn't sure of the details - clan secrets - but some techniques took their toll on the user. I could imagine that throwing your spirit around was one of them.</p><p>"Is he here?" I asked.</p><p>"Uh, yeah. Out in the greenhouses," Ino replied, twisting her hands together.</p><p>"Go and talk to him. I'll watch the counter," I said, making shooing motions at her. It wouldn't be the first time I'd worked here as the cashier. "Then we'll get together and write up a profile for Temari and see what we know about her."</p><p>"Right," she breathed deeply. "Good plan. See, I knew you could help me!"</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "Whatever, Ino."</p><p>I fluttered about the shop, taking care of the flowers, chatting to customers and cheerfully ringing up purchases for about half an hour before Ino came back out, her dad following behind her. I wasn't really surprised by the long wait, since Inoichi was the <em> master</em> at getting you to spill. Ino probably would have cracked and talked to him before too long even without my prompting.</p><p>"Shikako," he greeted. "I'm sorry to hear you didn't make it to the Finals."</p><p>I shrugged, philosophically. "Luck of the draw. If I'd come up against nearly anyone but Shikamaru, I probably would have."</p><p>Nearly anyone, because I would have forfeited twice as fast if I'd drawn Gaara.</p><p>"That's the spirit," he said. "Now, you two girls go and get some lunch. I'll take over here."</p><p>Ino was much more cheerful, nearly approaching her usual buoyant attitude, as we swung by to pick up Sakura who was predictably ecstatic to hear that Ino had made the Finals.</p><p>"Wow, Ino," Sakura said admiringly as we found a restaurant and ordered lunch. "Rookies so rarely get nominated for the Exams. For you to make it to the Finals is statistically… well."</p><p>Ino laughed uneasily, flicking her hair out of her face with a graceful wrist. "Yes, well. I got lucky in the prelims and didn't have to fight. That just means I really have to show what I can do in the Finals."</p><p>"Exactly," I agreed, pulling out a sheet of paper and a pen.</p><p><em> Temari of the desert</em> , I wrote at the top. Ino and I started by filling in everything we knew or had observed about her and how she fought. Sakura might not have been present for those fights, but she was a well of knowledge about chakra and ninjutsu types and was able to draw conclusions from the information we had gathered.</p><p>"Alright," I said, taking a break from writing to eat. "So she's a long range fighter and pretty well covered against projectiles. She's no slouch up close, either, and getting in close is a challenge in and of itself. We didn't really get to see much, but she fought smart so I wouldn't count on her being easy to fool."</p><p>"So I'm pretty much screwed," Ino concluded.</p><p>Sakura 'donk'ed her over the head. "Don't be like that."</p><p>"Sakura's right," I chided. "You can't give up before you begin. Now, Temari mostly used her fan - a Suna Tessen - to whip up her wind jutsu. So her attack would probably be weaker without it, though she probably wouldn't be helpless. Her defence was based on deflecting wind currents… so I wonder how it would handle explosive notes? Hmm…"</p><p>"Explosions aren't the answer to everything," Ino and Sakura chorused, giggling.</p><p>I poked my tongue at them. "You guys make me out to be so much worse than I really am."</p><p>"Wind jutsu are usually divided into either cutting and slicing attacks or brute force shoving attacks," Sakura said, voice taking a lecturing quality. "They can range from incredibly precise to wide range devastating attacks. It's strong against lightning based attacks, but weak towards fire - which it tends to enhance."</p><p>"Thank you, Sakura-sensei," I said.</p><p>She flushed and slapped me lightly on the shoulder.</p><p>"The attacks we saw her use were quite large and Tessen lean more towards wide ranging than incredibly precise, so dodging them is going to be an issue," I mused. "There's also the fact that she was able to <em> fly</em> on it… so pinning her down is going to be difficult."</p><p>Ino sighed, then examined her hands. "Does anyone know what the arena for the Finals is going to be like? Inside, outside… What have I got to work with?"</p><p>I tapped the pen against my lips. "It's in the stadium, isn't it? We could go and have a look but they might change it between now and then."</p><p>"That's better than nothing," Ino said. "After lunch?"</p><p>"Sorry," Sakura said, looking down. "I've got class this afternoon."</p><p>"Yeah?" I asked. "How's that going?"</p><p>We chattered away until she had to leave, then picked up our stuff and headed towards the stadium. The offices were locked, but it was easy enough to get into the arena itself. It'd probably be more securely guarded closer to the date, but for now we got in just fine.</p><p>"Well," Ino said, looking around.</p><p>From inside, the stadium looked <em> huge.</em> The stark concrete walls were intimidating and tall, almost seeming to make the place claustrophobic. The ground was scuffed, dry dirt and grass, packed down hard, and there were scraggly bushes and trees around the circumference.</p><p>"Not very much cover," I said, inspecting the trees. They might do for a bit, but it wouldn't be a viable long term strategy.</p><p>"Mm," Ino said vaguely. I wondered if she was already starting to plan. Apart from her initial panic, Ino was nothing to sneeze at in an opponent. In any other year, she would have been the top kunoichi, if not the rookie of the year. Well, maybe not against Neji, but the point still stood.</p><p>On our way back to the Flower Shop we ran into Asuma-sensei.</p><p>"Oh, Ino! There you are. I've been looking for you," he said.</p><p>"Asuma-sensei?" She blinked. "Oh, right. We've been brainstorming." She fluttered the paper with Temari's details on it at him.</p><p>"Good girl. I was going to ask you what training you needed for the Finals." He puffed on his cigarette, eyes flickering to me.</p><p>"That's my cue to leave," I said wryly. By rights, with my team mates and brother in the Finals, I probably shouldn't stick around to hear her training plans. "I'll catch you around, Ino."</p><p>"Thanks for your help," she said sincerely. "I think I was a little freaked out this morning."</p><p>I laughed. "Something like that."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Break: Chapter 26</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: So I was browsing through the Narutopedia and I saw that the Nara family techniques were listed as Hiden. Secret Techniques that aren't a bloodline but can't be copied <em> even with the Sharingan</em> . So that said to me that there was more to the techniques than hand seals and chakra. Added to the fact that Shikamaru, resident genius, knows one technique by the Chunin Exams and only the very basics of a second by the Sasuke Retrieval Arc… something's going on here, right?</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 26</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> A winning effort begins with preparation. ~Joe Gibbs</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>It was at the dinner table that Dad announced a change in plans. He did it in his usual laid back manner that belied the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>"After dinner, we're going to start training," Dad said. "I didn't want to start teaching you this until you made Chunin but given the circumstances… it might be for the best."</p><p>Given that he'd spent most of our lives telling us that learning the Clan techniques was a delicate process best done in carefully calculated stages… it was a bit of a surprise. Mum looked pleased with the announcement, but I was never quite sure she understood <em> why</em> Dad was so set on the stages. Intellectually, she knew, but she didn't use Shadow Jutsu and that made a difference.</p><p><em> Circumstances…? Does he mean Orochimaru?</em></p><p>If Orochimaru had targeted my team once, he might do it again. I suppose I could see that as something that would change his mind. Maybe.</p><p>"Teaching us what, exactly?" Shikamaru asked, looking like he was having the same thoughts as me.</p><p>"You'll just have to wait and see," Dad deflected.</p><p>Shikamaru slumped back into his chair. "Troublesome," he muttered.</p><p>"Good," Mum said firmly. "I'll work with you in the morning and your father has you at night. That gives you the afternoon to train with your sensei." Her look clearly said Shikamaru <em> would</em> spend that time training and not cloud watching.</p><p>I smirked at him. "I hope you're planning, Shikamaru. Shadow Possession isn't going to do much against a thousand bugs."</p><p>He glared at me balefully. Shino was a pretty horrific opponent for him to face. Not only did free moving bugs negate the effectiveness of Shadow Possession, Shino was pretty clever himself.</p><p>I'd spent the afternoon writing up more profiles of the competitors for the Finals. I'd copied Temari's profile out from memory, intending on plotting it out further when I'd decided I might as well draw up some for her brothers… and then Neji and Shino as well. That way I could just hand the whole thing out to everyone and not feel bad about helping some more than others. They weren't complete, and I'd have to look up Jyuuken and find out more specifics about what Shino could do but I already knew enough to know that Shikamaru was at a disadvantage.</p><p>"There's a way around every obstacle," Dad said mildly. I wasn't sure if he was chiding me or reassuring Shikamaru. Probably both for the effort of one response. That was the Nara way.</p><p>The days were long so there was still plenty of sunlight after dinner. We traipsed out into the forest and were directed to gather firewood. Shikamaru and I exchanged looks and shrugged; presumably there was a method to this madness.</p><p>Dad led us to a small clearing in a hollow and we set up a fire on top of what looked like the remains of a hundred other fires. There was ash and charcoal and a circular dead space amongst the grass.</p><p>"Wish I brought marshmallows," I said wistfully, looking at the dancing flames. It built slowly, first consuming the tinder then the twigs before catching the larger pieces alight. Shikamaru slumped backwards, lying down and staring up at the sky.</p><p>Dad didn't say anything. Sometimes, clan training was like being given the pieces of a puzzle and having to put them together yourself. I wondered what pieces he was handing us now?</p><p>The dancing flame caused the shadows to waver, overlap and change. But none of that was really new.</p><p>When the fire was burning well, nearly roaring, Dad threw something in the flames that made the smoke spew out thick and heavy, hanging around the ground instead of rising into the sky.</p><p>Shika and I both looked dubiously at the smoke.</p><p>"I hope there's not going to be any singing and dancing involved," Shikamaru sighed. "That'd be such a <em> drag</em> ."</p><p>"Idiots. It's not <em> that</em> kind of smoke," Dad drawled, though there was a smirk on his face.</p><p>"So what's it for, then?" Shikamaru asked. "It's not like you'd drag us out here for nothing."</p><p>"Look at your shadows and you tell me," he said cryptically, leaning back against a tree trunk and stretching his long legs out. It seemed like he was preparing to be here a while.</p><p>We looked. And looked. It wasn't until I was stretching my arm out, wiggling my fingers in the smoke and watching my shadow do the same that I saw it.</p><p>"Fog shadow," I murmured, naming the phenomena. "Shadows are three dimensional; they occupy all the space behind an object that blocks the light. Usually, we only see two dimensions, when they hit the ground… but the smoke is heavy enough that it shows up."</p><p>It was like watching dust motes dance in a sun beam. Sort of. The opposite, really.</p><p>"That's exactly right," Dad drawled. "So far, you've only been using your shadows to connect to the shadow of someone else and Possess them. But the higher level clan techniques use shadows manifested as something solid."</p><p>He demonstrated, creating a thin tendril with the Shadow Stitching Jutsu and sending it punching through the trunk of a tree. Splinters went flying.</p><p>"I see," Shikamaru said thoughtfully. "So instead of pushing our chakra into the shadow on the ground, it has to go into all of it…."</p><p>I could see an immediate problem. "But the increase in chakra drain would be proportional to the increase in volume… it'd be too much." Even the Shadow Possession Jutsu wasn't <em> chakra light. </em> "Even if you only did it by surface area, it'd still…"</p><p>"And now you see where our family's <em> unique</em> affinity with shadows comes into play." He leant backwards against tree again. "Shadows are considered the negative double of the body, the alter ego of the soul… associated with the unconscious mind. So, it might be said that we have a <em> spiritual</em> affinity."</p><p>There were numerous, slight differences between mental and spiritual energy. Both combined, formed half of chakra but 'originated' from different sources. Mental energy came from learning and experiences, while spiritual energy was your 'willpower', or personality. Once, I might have scoffed at the notion of 'spiritual' anything, but I of all people could hardly deny that souls existed. How else could I be here?</p><p>"Oh, I see," I said, realisation dawning. "That's how we can force people to mimic us with the Shadow Possession Jutsu. Because there's such a large mental component to it… we're not physically <em> forcing</em> them to move like a puppet jutsu would, we're using a sympathetic connection to convince their chakra that we're the same thing, and then when one moves so does the other…"</p><p>Sneaky. Insidious.</p><p>"But how does that help us here?" Shikamaru drawled. "It's not like you can change your spiritual energy, right?" he asked, uneasily. That's what we'd been taught. Because chakra and the energies that compromised them were a catch-22 situation; if something affected your body then it would affect your physical energy… and if it affected your physical energy it would affect the body. The same was true with the soul, and really, did you <em> want</em> to mess with that?</p><p>"Change?" Dad echoed. "No, not exactly. You don't need to <em> change</em> . You already are what you need to be. You just need to … synchronise properly."</p><p>I wasn't exactly sure I understood. Or that I liked where this was going.</p><p>"The Shadow Possession is the first Jutsu you learn for a reason. It's a gateway jutsu to the more complex clan techniques. However, it's very chakra inefficient. You can hold it for a minute, tops. But in order to make it more effective, you need to become more <em> in tune</em> with your affinity to shadow. Which is what leads us on to the next level techniques. Understand?"</p><p>I nodded, a little reluctantly.</p><p>"Hiden," Shikamaru murmured. "Secret techniques. No wonder…"</p><p>"Yes," Dad said simply. "And most of the upper level jutsus are Forbidden Techniques." Not 'forbidden' in the common sense - as in 'don't touch' - but in the sense of ninja rankings. More 'caution, extreme danger; use at your own risk'. "Which is why you <em> will not</em> even <em> attempt</em> this training without proper supervision."</p><p>We gave our word easily. Neither of us were particularly willing to run the risk of causing ourselves damage by messing around with our own energy unsupervised.</p><p>There wasn't any neat tricks or special procedure to doing it, which was good, because having to fight a manifestation of your inner self or something would have been far too cliché for me to handle. It was basically a kind of meditation exercise - activate our shadows, isolate the way the chakra felt where/when it was strongest, and attempt to increase that feeling. Simple in theory but with many problems in execution. Like, how exactly do you tell where it's strongest? How do you measure and replicate that? Was I the ratio of energies in the chakra? Presumably the affinities, since that was what we were talking about…</p><p>I was pretty sure I achieved nothing by the time Dad called a halt. "That's enough," he drawled. "You wont learn this quickly. Certainly not by the Chunin Exams."</p><p>Shikamaru groaned. "Troublesome."</p><p>"There's no point in rushing ahead and losing sight of where you're going," he said philosophically. "That doesn't do anyone any good."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning, Mum made good on her promise to train us. She'd been doing so on and off ever since I came back from the Land of Waves, but Shika's inclusion in the Finals seemed to have driven her to step it up a notch.</p><p>The fact that Shikamaru didn't moan about it - much - let me know he was really kind of worried about his up coming fight.</p><p>After training I slipped off to drop into the hospital to visit Hinata - and to check that Sasuke was still here. He was, but not allowed visitors and the receptionist was fairly certain he was going to be released this afternoon. Good, he and Sensei hadn't left yet.</p><p>Hinata looked far too surprised that someone was visiting her and I made a mental note to stop by more often.</p><p>"Er, hi, Hinata," I said. Her room was pretty bland, but I spied a familiar set of flowers in pride of place on her bedside table. "How are you doing?"</p><p>"Ah! Shikako," she said, blinking at me. "I - I'm fine."</p><p>Given that she looked pretty awful and was in one of the more heavily monitored sections of the hospital 'fine' was probably an overstatement.</p><p>"That's good to hear," I said, not pushing the issue. "We were all really worried about you after the prelims."</p><p>Her fingers twisted together and she ducked her head. "Yes. Kiba and Shino have already been to visit me. And Naruto…" A light blush dusted across her cheeks. "Is it true? Is he facing Neji-nii-san in the Finals?"</p><p>I nodded. "Yeah. The first match of the day. After what Neji did to you, Naruto isn't going to let him get away unscathed. Or at all. Neji might be good, but Naruto is… surprising." I quirked a smile at her.</p><p>She smiled back tentatively. "He is very strong," she acknowledged.</p><p>"You've got good eyes, Hinata. I think… you were the first person to ever see that." Even for me it had been difficult to see what Naruto <em> could</em> be, and I had known what he would turn into. But Hinata had seen what he <em> was</em> .</p><p>She flushed, though whether at the compliment or the topic, I wasn't sure. "I'm not… I'm not very strong…"</p><p>I squeezed her hand. "Yeah you are, Hinata. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. We got our asses kicked too, remember? But we got back up and kept fighting, and so did you. For now, you just need to heal so that when the next fight comes along, you can show them how much you've grown."</p><p>She looked at me, expression indecipherable, the nodded. "Y-yeah. That's right. I have changed…"</p><p>I smiled. "Exactly. So, anyway. Uh, I know it's pretty boring in here so I brought you a few of my books… I don't know if you'll like them but…" I shrugged awkwardly. "You can borrow them for now."</p><p>There was a few fiction books and an encyclopaedia on the medical uses of plants. It wasn't exactly exciting reading, but I knew Hinata made her own medical salve, so she might have liked it.</p><p>"Umm, I can bring others if you've already read these… just let me know."</p><p>"Thank you," Hinata said quietly. "I haven't. Read these, I mean. It's not considered… appropriate material…" 'for a Hyuuga' went unsaid.</p><p>I blinked. "Seriously?" I double checked the books in my hands. Nope, young adult adventure books. Nothing inappropriate here. "Wow. They're not exactly <em> high class literature</em> but they're not that bad. Let me know if you like them, I've practically got a whole bookshelf full in my room."</p><p>I stacked the books on the table and waved goodbye. It had been a short visit, but I had a boy to meet about some ramen.</p><p>Naruto was already at Ichiraku when I ducked under the banner.</p><p>"Hey, Shikako!" He greeted, boundlessly cheerful. "You'll never guess what happened yesterday!"</p><p>"What happened?" I echoed, ordering a miso ramen. "Weren't you supposed to be training with Ebisu-sensei?"</p><p>"Yeah," he said sheepishly. "I was!" he defended at my sharp look. "We went and talked to Hinata and everything. Then he said he needed to 'judge my skill level' or whatever, so we went to one of the training grounds to spar. He's actually pretty good," he added grudgingly.</p><p>"Kicked your ass, did he?" I said knowingly.</p><p>"No! Well, maybe a little bit. But it's not like he used any jutsus or anything, so he's still lame." He scowled. "And he said my chakra control was really bad and my taijutsu was sloppy. He was going to teach me Water Walking, but I already know that!" He looked pleased at having exceeded expectations.</p><p>"Chakra control, huh?" I mused. "Did you get that seal removed?"</p><p>"What? Oh, yeah. Kakashi-sensei took me to the Old Man after the prelims. He knew what it was, right away. No problem!" He grinned.</p><p>"Well, he is the Hokage," I said. "So what'd you do instead?"</p><p>"Uh, well. He asked me if I'd ever fought while Water Walking." He twirled ramen around his chopsticks, almost pensively. "I said no, so we went to this hot springs place to practice. The hot water kept busting up my clones whenever they fell in." He grimaced. "It was <em> really</em> hot. And it's really hard to keep your balance when someone is trying to knock you around like that."</p><p>"I know," I said soothingly. Not that I'd ever fought on water, either. Though I'd probably do better than Naruto who tended to learn something once and then call it done. He was getting better at that, but I doubted he had done much Water Walking since Wave Country.</p><p>"Yeah, so we were fighting and then there was this old guy peeping on the ladies bath." He froze and cast a nervous look at me. "And then the closet pervert - Ebisu, I mean - tried to tell him off but he just got knocked out. Then the old guy said he was, like, some kind of toad sage or something… so I figured, he must be a ninja, right?"</p><p><em> Toad sage? That sounds like…</em></p><p>"Yeah, so I left some clones to keep training and watch out for Ebisu and then I went to convince the pervy sage to train me. I figured, he had to know at least one decent technique." He scowled again, waving his arms about. "He didn't want to but I got him in the end. Heh. Another one falls to the Sexy Jutsu."</p><p><em> Definitely sounds like…</em></p><p>"So you're training with both of them?" I asked, amused. It was actually a really good idea.</p><p>"Yeah," Naruto said, sounding slightly less than enthused. He looked… troubled. "It's weird… maybe you can help me…"</p><p>"Shoot," I agreed easily, wondering what was up.</p><p>"Well, it's like this, see," he said. "The pervy sage… he keeps talking about how I have a lot of chakra, right? So he said I should learn how to… err… learn how to increase the amount of chakra I can use."</p><p><em> Or learn how to draw on Kyuubi's chakra, right?</em></p><p>"Mmm, I guess," I said.</p><p>"But the closet pervert - Ebisu-sensei, I mean - he says that I should increase my chakra control so I don't waste so much chakra doing techniques. But when I tell <em> him</em> that I have a lot of chakra, he says it doesn't matter and that I'm still weaker…" he trailed off quietly.</p><p>"So which one is right?" I guessed at his dilemma. On the surface, they seemed like two contradictory approaches. "Well, it's like this. You have a lot of chakra, right? But because your control isn't so good, you waste a heap of it instead of being able to use it in Jutsu. So effectively, you really only have <em> half</em> the amount of chakra you seem to have." He nodded, showing that he was following. "Now if you increased the total amount of chakra you have, then that <em> half</em> would increase too. But if you increased your control, you'd be using maybe three quarters or even all of it instead. So by both approaches, you'd still end up with more chakra to use."</p><p>"And if I did both, I'd end up with twice as much!" He grinned, making an intuitive leap ahead. That was Naruto. You couldn't be sure he understood and then he went and surprised you.</p><p>I blinked. "Yeah, that's right. Increasing your chakra control has other benefits too; for starters it makes using Jutsu easier."</p><p>"It does?" Naruto practically shouted. "Why didn't anyone tell me that?"</p><p>I nearly sweat dropped. "It's in the name. Chakra control - the ability to guide and direct… oh, never mind. You never noticed how Sasuke and I spent less time gathering our chakra when we're using Jutsu?"</p><p>"Well, yeah." Naruto shifted uncomfortably. "But… I just thought… so that's what it is, huh? Chakra control."</p><p><em> Just thought we were </em> better<em> than you.</em> I could read the unfinished sentence easily enough. For all his bravado, Naruto was surprisingly aware that he wasn't, really, all that good. He just never really admitted it and hated it when other people brought it up.</p><p>"Well," I said, picking up the napkin that was next to my bowl. "This is a chakra control exercise." I emitted chakra gently to float it about five centimetres off my palm. It came easily, without even thinking about it. Behind the counter, Ayame gasped. I guess civilians didn't really get to see chakra being used a lot. "Iruka-sensei showed us how to do this with leaves, remember?"</p><p>"Uh, not really. I think I skipped that day," Naruto admitted, squinting at it.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "Right. It's like Tree Climbing. You constantly emit chakra, only instead of trying to stick to something, you use it to push it away and hold it steady. If you use too much, it'll just be thrown away."</p><p>"Like being pushed off the tree," Naruto said.</p><p>"Right. You should probably ask Ebisu-sensei for more control techniques. I bet he knows heaps of them," I suggested. No doubt Ebisu would be incredibly surprised at the request.</p><p>Naruto's napkin fluttered through the air, landing solidly in his ramen bowl. "Ah no! Not in the ramen!"</p><p>I giggled. "So what <em> have</em> you been learning?"</p><p>"Well, the closet pervert has been working on my taijutsu. I don't know <em> why</em> , since he said that I wouldn't want to get in close to Neji." He looked at me expectantly.</p><p>"Eh, your clones use the same taijutsu you do," I said, taking a stab at the reasoning. "So if <em> your</em> taijutsu is better, their taijutsu is better and they'll be more effective. If you get in close Neji can shut your chakra down like he did to Hinata and you wont be able to use any techniques at all. But your clones will disperse with a hit anyway, so…"</p><p>"So it doesn't matter if he shuts their chakra down," Naruto finished. "Hinata was saying stuff about that. How they, like, shoot chakra out of their hands and it messes you up really badly inside. You can't even see it until they hit you. And then, like, their eyes can see through everything so you can't even hide. Creepy."</p><p>"They can also use it defensively," I said. "To deflect things. I bet Neji practices with Tenten a lot, so he's probably pretty good at that too."</p><p>"Well I'm going to be better!" Naruto proclaimed. "The pervy sage is teaching me this really cool technique."</p><p>"Really?" I asked. "What is it?"</p><p>"Summoning Jutsu! It's like this contract thing and then you can summon toads!" Naruto said.</p><p>I hid a smile. "I've heard of them. Orochimaru summoned snakes, remember? You said you got eaten by one of them."</p><p>"Wait, that was a summon? That thing was huge! Sheesh, no wonder the pervy sage says it takes a lot of chakra. I can't even summon anything good yet! I keep getting tadpoles."</p><p>"Maybe more chakra control will help?" I suggested. "Hey, do you think that I could meet your 'pervy sage'?"</p><p>He blinked at me. "Sure, but why would you want to do that? The old guy is an awful letch."</p><p>"I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all," I said. "Maybe tomorrow? That way I can bring all my seal workbooks…"</p><p>How much I'd be able to get out of him would be another story all together. Worst came to, Naruto would probably pester him into answering at least one question.</p><p>"Sure, we were out by training ground 31 today, so… we'll probably be there tomorrow too." He shrugged.</p><p>"Sweet. Thanks." That would give me a chance to get over the huge roadblock I'd run into on my sealing. Hopefully. Superstitiously, I crossed my fingers. "Are you still working on your Hidden in the Mist Jutsu?" I asked. "It wont help you much against Neji, since he'd be able to see through it, but it might help against some of the others…"</p><p>Like Gaara. Wet sand was heavier than dry. Probably more difficult to control, too. Of course, he'd have to have a decent water supply to use…</p><p>He pursed his lips. "You're right. Once I beat Neji, I'll have to fight Sasuke. The mist is good against him. Maybe if I get some clones to work on it while I'm with …"</p><p>"It'd be a good idea," I acknowledged. "Your Shadow Clones are really handy, you know?"</p><p>He grinned, hand going behind his head. "Yup. It's the most awesome technique ever!"</p><p>After lunch I waved goodbye to him and headed off to the library for research. There'd be nothing there directly on the Hyuuga and Aburame - I'd have better luck in our clan archives - but I'd already discovered that historical records could be a treasure trove of information. Added to that, Kikai might not have been listed anywhere, but they were beetles and I could extrapolate from general information.</p><p>For example, like most insects, Kikai had waterproof exoskeletons. However, insects didn't have lungs. They breathed through a tracheal system, that opened into the atmosphere through a series of holes all over their bodies called spiracles. If these spiracles were covered in water, an insect would drown just as surely as a mammal.</p><p>Kikai were also susceptible to poisons and insecticides, though if a hive contained even a single beetle with a resistant mutation then a skilled Aburame could quickly breed a resistant strain. Evolution on a reduced time frame.</p><p>Smoke could sometimes affect the ability of the hive to communicate with each other by masking pheromones, which was why beekeepers used smoke. That had limited effectiveness here though, because, the Aburame controlled their hive via chakra. Or something.</p><p>"Taking up entomology?" Kakashi-sensei asked, lifting the cover of a book with a single finger. <em> Handbook; Coleoptera.</em></p><p>I jerked, pen scratching across my notepaper. I hadn't even noticed him arrive. "Kakashi-sensei!"</p><p>His eye crinkled in good humour. "Yare, yare; inside voice. This is a library, you know."</p><p>"No, really?" I asked dryly. "I hadn't noticed."</p><p>"And you say I never teach you anything," Sensei said, looking mighty pleased with himself.</p><p>I groaned. "Sensei…"</p><p>He chuckled and pulled out a very battered looking map. "This is where we're going." I was slightly surprised that he had actually come to tell me, but glad for it.</p><p>I eyed the spot he was pointing at. The map was very basic, but I was sure that on my more detailed map that location had altitude lines. "There's a plateau there, right? And a cave system…" My fingers touched the spot, then 'walked' back to Konoha, measuring the distance. "It's about two hours out…"</p><p>Easily able to be covered in a day, there and back. I'd worried that it would be further out.</p><p>"I'd tell you not to visit…" Kakashi-sensei drawled. "If I thought you'd listen. Instead, I'll tell you to keep the trips down to every three days."</p><p>I was glad he didn't forbid it. I didn't <em> like</em> going against rulings and I especially didn't want to find out how far I could push Kakashi-sensei before he started retaliating. I had a feeling you only went that far <em> once</em> .</p><p>"When are you leaving?" I asked.</p><p>"Mmm, I'm supposed to pick Sasuke up from the hospital at two," he replied.</p><p>I glanced at the clock reflexively. "It's half past four."</p><p>"Why so it is." He smiled.</p><p>Yeah, Sasuke was going to try and kill him within a week.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Break: Chapter 27</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: I have the slight suspicion that the Byakugan <em> can</em> see through Transformation Jutsu, but I can't find any episode that has that info in it. If any one knows, drop me a line and I'll see if it matches up with what I intend to do…</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 27</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Speed is a great asset; but it's greater when it's combined with quickness - and there's a big difference.~ Ty Cobb</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I made good on my promise to interrupt Naruto's training the next day, picking up my seal notebooks and scurrying out to the training fields. Truth be told, I was a little nervous. I'd never had to actually go and bother a complete, uninterested stranger for help before.</p><p>Still, it wasn't like I was going to get a better chance.</p><p>"Shikako! Look! Look!" Naruto shouted, shoving something bright green in my face. My eyes crossed trying to focus on it. "I did it! I summoned a toad!"</p><p>It was, well, a pretty small toad. Barely the size of one of his hands. But considering he'd only started learning how to summon creatures yesterday it wasn't bad. Especially when you considered Naruto had several dozen Shadow Clones running around at the moment. In fact, I didn't even know if this was the <em> real</em> one.</p><p>"That's great, Naruto," I said smiling.</p><p>Someone snorted. "I wouldn't get so excited about it, kid. That's a pretty pathetic attempt!"</p><p>"Shut up! I'm trying, alright?" Naruto hollered back.</p><p>I perked up, looking for the voice. There. A white haired man crouching behind a screen of bushes, giggling every now and then.</p><p>"Is that…?" I asked.</p><p>Naruto scowled. "Yeah, that's the pervy sage. Are you <em> really </em> sure you wanna meet him?" The way he said it implied he couldn't imagine why anyone would.</p><p>"What's this?" Jiraiya cried, suddenly there in the same way Sensei sometimes was - exactly where you didn't expect him. "Someone wants to meet with the great Jiraiya? Is it a pretty woman? Oh, brat, you make me so proud!"</p><p>"It's not like that, you - you pervert!" Naruto exploded, waving his hands about and shouting at the top of his lungs. "Why can't you be serious at all?"</p><p>"Well, you're <em> starting</em> to get the right idea," Jiraiya leered at me, clapping Naruto firmly on the shoulder. "This one is a little young for me though." He laughed, a tad too long and a tad too loud to sound natural.</p><p>I waited for the feeling of embarrassment or outrage to start up. There was some but…</p><p>A lifetime ago something like that would have had me flushing and stammering. Now? I wanted to check over my shoulder to see who he was talking to.</p><p>There was a feeling of disconnection, like the seconds pause when I looked in the mirror and didn't recognise the face looking back. Sometimes I still looked for a rounder face, a curvier body, lighter hair, paler skin… sometimes. Just enough to make me feel like this skin wasn't <em> quite</em> mine.</p><p>So Jiraiya leering at it…</p><p>It didn't <em> feel</em> like he was looking at <em> me</em> .</p><p>It probably wasn't a very healthy way to feel, but it worked for now.</p><p>"Jiraiya-sama," I said, bowing low. "Please-"</p><p>He cut me off before I even had a chance to ask. "Oh, no. Just because I got suckered in to teaching this brat doesn't mean I'm about to go around giving lessons to every kid he drags along. So you can just toddle off back home and do whatever it is young girls do." He giggled, thoughts drifting off on an obvious and obnoxious tangent.</p><p>"I-"</p><p>"Nope. Not a chance. Sorry." He waved half-heartedly over his shoulder and turned to go back to his previous spot watching whatever he was watching.</p><p>He obviously wasn't going to listen. Not without something to catch his attention. My thoughts raced. It was a gamble, because he <em> was </em> a ninja and a Sannin at that but he was obviously fairly laidback and I was mostly sure I could get away with it.</p><p>Shadow Possession wasn't strictly an <em> attack</em> jutsu. And there was no way he'd regard me as an actual threat.</p><p>My shadow lashed out.</p><p>"Jiraiya-sama," I said hurriedly, knowing it wouldn't pause him for long. Not if he didn't want it to. "I've been studying seal work but there is only so far I can get studying books without someone to ask for clarification. Please, could you answer a few questions?"</p><p>I dropped the Shadow Possession, knowing it would be better to let him go than have him break it. I definitely didn't want him to see me as any kind of enemy. He turned back around, and this time there was <em> weight</em> in his gaze. I raised my chin. I hadn't faltered before, under Orochimaru, and I wouldn't falter here.</p><p>"A Nara, huh?" he muttered. "Sorry, little girl, regardless of whatever clan tricks you've got up your sleeves, you just <em> don't impress me.</em> " There was a shiver in the air. Not quite Killing Intent but … Intent all the same. It made me highly aware that if he wanted, he could crush me and <em> I couldn't do a thing</em> . "I'm a busy man, I don't have time to hold your hand and teach you how to make your own explosive tags or whatever kids want to do with seals these days."</p><p>It was utterly dismissive.</p><p>I couldn't stop the flash of anger in my eyes. "I already know how to make my own explosive tags," I said, pulling my notebook out of my pouch. This one held all the different templates for the tags I used. There were about twenty different variations of explosive tags alone. "What I want - what I <em> need</em> - to know is how to create my own seals. And how to apply them with a touch for use in combat. <em> Nothing</em> I have read even hints at it." I frowned just a little put out about it. Oh, I understood <em> why</em> ninja were so stingy with information, but it didn't stop being irritating.</p><p>Jiraiya's look was reconsidering, and he snatched my notebook out of my hands with a lightning fast movement. "Hmmm," he said, flicking through the pages. "You'll never be able to seal like that using mass production seals like these," Jiraiya shook his head. "You have to <em> own</em> your seals. Mind and soul. Look, the reason no one else can do the Fourth Hokage's Flying Thunder God Technique isn't do to any safety seals or secrecy seals, no matter what anyone else says. It's because he invented his own damn branch of sealing to make it work."</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>"Look. Seals are all about influencing the world with your chakra. The ink, the symbols… its all trapping. Important, yeah, but …" he flicked his fingers back and forth.</p><p>"But… then why are there so many distinct branches of sealing?" I asked, bewildered.</p><p>He laughed. "People only think in so many different ways, kid. You live long enough, you'll work <em> that</em> one out."</p><p>"Oh." I blinked. That made… so much damn sense. "So I guess this is useless then." I looked down at the second notebook I'd pulled out. Jiraiya quirked a brow. "I was comparing the twelve most used branches of sealing arts. Method, theory, range of uses, results, points of conflicts…" I trailed off. Sealing was a matter of putting your own thoughts, own ideas, to paper, and then making them <em> real</em> . No wonder nobody used the same process. Oh, there were bits cut from here and there, bastardisations of this technique or that, overlaps, crossovers, wild leaps of imagination.</p><p>Every seal master created their own <em> language</em> . Not out of arrogance, not to mess with everyone else, or to keep their seals secret… but because they had to.</p><p>"Let's see it," Jiraiya said. I handed it over, mind still whirling. That new perspective… changed everything. Sealing was so unpredictable, so arbitrary, because <em> people</em> were. In computer terms…The seals weren't the hardware… they were the <em> interface.</em></p><p>"Well, you completely missed the <em> point</em> ," Jiraiya said slowly. I nodded along. "But… do you mind if I read through this? A large part of being a seal master is working out what <em> other</em> people have done. I'll correct any mistakes you've made."</p><p>"Yes, of course, Jiraiya-sama," I said automatically. I wasn't quite sure what the look he gave me meant, it was long and judging and lacked any of the lechery he usually emitted. Probably wondering how I'd missed the point so badly.</p><p><em> Damn.</em></p><p>"Eh, I don't get what you're talking about!" Naruto complained, crossing his arms.</p><p>I jolted. I'd mostly forgotten he was there. You knew you were preoccupied when you forgot about <em> Naruto.</em> "Uh, I just did something dumb, that's all." I smiled at him sheepishly. "But that just means I have more training to do now. Sorry for interrupting your training and all."</p><p>Naruto shrugged the apology off. "Nah, don't worry about it. It's not like the pervy sage does anything but watch those girls, anyway. Hey! Maybe you can help me with this jutsu!"</p><p>I blinked. "Of course, Naruto. You know I'll always help you. What are you having problems with?"</p><p>"I'm doing this summoning jutsu, right? But all I keep getting are these tadpoles and tiny frogs! I want to summon a really big one, like the pervy sage did!" Naruto exclaimed.</p><p>"Okay," I said slowly. "So how does this jutsu work?"</p><p>Naruto demonstrated. "I build up the chakra, and do the hand seals and… <em> Summoning Jutsu!</em> " he slammed his hand down onto the ground, chakra smoke billowing out.</p><p><em> Ribbit!</em></p><p>"Aww, man. That's another tiny one!" The frog was slightly larger than the one he'd shoved into my face at first, but not by much.</p><p>"Hmmm," I said. I'd felt the build up, and I'd felt the chakra that he'd actually <em> used</em> in the jutsu. The difference was pretty damn big. "Let me try something. I'm going to use my diagnostic jutsu on you while you do the summoning jutsu, okay?" I summoned medical chakra to my hands and placed them on his shoulders. It took me a few seconds to zone in on his chakra system. "Okay, do it again now."</p><p>Using my chakra sense, I could get a fairly decent picture of his chakra usage, but this jutsu was <em> designed</em> for close up investigation of the body. Naruto's chakra built up and up and up, so much it must have been almost painful, then just … fizzled, as he tried to do the jutsu, only small amounts drizzling down his arm and into the summon.</p><p>I drew back and considered.</p><p>"Well?" He asked.</p><p>"Give me a second," I said, biting my lip. What on earth was going on here? It was bad chakra control, sure… but…</p><p>"Let me see you do a Shadow Clone," I said, creating more medical chakra.</p><p>Naruto didn't even question why. He built up his chakra again, faster and easier this time with a more familiar jutsu… and then it was snatched away, twisted into the air to form a new body.</p><p>I had a sneaky suspicion. "A Transformation?"</p><p>Again, his chakra built… and again it twisted outwards reforming his body. He didn't <em> channel</em> it.</p><p>There was more than one part to chakra control. You had to mould it, creating a balance of physical and mental energy. Then you had to manipulate it into doing whatever you wanted.</p><p>Naruto wasn't <em> great</em> at moulding chakra, being inefficient, but seemed to be much worse at <em> manipulating</em> it. His best techniques were ones that seemed to just <em> take</em> the energy given to him and manipulate it themselves.</p><p>"Hmm." I drew back again.</p><p>He looked at me expectantly.</p><p>"Okay. Let's try this," I said, deciding. "Build up your chakra." He did, closing his eyes to concentrate. His chakra built until it was nearly visible radiating from his skin. I winced. Gods, it was just <em> steaming</em> off him; what a waste. "Now do the hand seals <em> but</em> don't do the summoning yet." Slowly his hands moved through the seals, his face scowling in concentration. "<em> Now</em> move the chakra in your Hara down your arm."</p><p>Naruto blinked his eyes open. "Huh?"</p><p>I touched his stomach where the bulk of the chakra was. "This is where you're building your chakra, right? Now, you need to move it up your shoulder and down your arm." I traced my hand down the path it should have followed.</p><p>Naruto grimaced as he tried to follow. He was just bleeding chakra at an amazing rate.</p><p>"Now do the summoning bit," I said, as it reached his hand.</p><p>"Summoning Jutsu!" Naruto said, biting his thumb and slamming his hand down on the ground.</p><p>Chakra dispersed.</p><p>"Yo!" A small orange toad said. It still wasn't very big, maybe the size of Akamaru, but it was an improvement.</p><p>"Hah! I did it!" Naruto exclaimed. "That's super cool! But… I don't get why it worked now but not before…" he looked at me hesitantly.</p><p>"Well," I said. "When you're Tree Walking or Water Walking, you build the chakra in your feet, right?"</p><p>Naruto nodded. "Right. Kakashi-sensei said that was the hardest part of the body to gather chakra." He looked pleased with himself for remembering.</p><p>"Exactly," I beamed. "So if you use your feet for those techniques, what are you using for this one?"</p><p>Naruto blinked. Then stared at his hand that still had blood smeared across the fingertips. "My hand. So I… should have been moulding chakra in my hand all along? OH MAN! Why didn't I think of that?" He smacked himself in the forehead.</p><p>"Ebisu-sensei probably talked to you about chakra control right? And manipulating it?" I asked.</p><p>"He said I wasn't any good at it," Naruto confirmed mulishly.</p><p>"You lose a lot of chakra between moulding it and using it in the jutsu. So you need to focus on moving it where you want to go, right?" I asked. "That's probably what more chakra control will help you with the most."</p><p>"Right! I'm going to get this jutsu down. Believe it!" Naruto said firmly. "Here I come! <em> Summoning Jutsu!</em> "</p><p>I smiled. "I'll leave you to it, then."</p><p>I headed back to the clan grounds, head buzzing with new information. I wanted to get started on sealing right away, but I also wanted to finish drawing up my analysis sheets on the other Genin. That way, I could pass them out to my friends tomorrow.</p><p>So instead of heading back to my room, I set course for the clan archives.</p><p>The Nara Clan collected information.</p><p>There were four buildings on the clan property that had secret basements converted into libraries. One was open to anyone in the clan, one to Genin, one to Chunin and the last only to those who had achieved Jounin rank. I suspected there was more that were too secret for me to even <em> know</em> of. That wasn't even counting the secret cache of information that each ninja would likely compile, to be added to the clan archives after their death (provided the clan head agreed, of course).</p><p>We collected information like Uchiha collected techniques. Some of it bizarrely specific, like my great uncle who had gone to lengths to classify precisely the kind of parasites that our deer collected. (Of course, that then led to medical treatments to remove them, so it wasn't <em> useless</em> ). Other information was very broad. Other information still was likely stuff other people would like to keep secret.</p><p>Like, for example, fighting styles of other clans.</p><p>At Genin level, I didn't have access to <em> that much</em> about the Aburame or Hyuuga, but it was enough. Some of it, I had already puzzled out yesterday at the Konoha Library. Some of it sparked more ideas, and I wanted to go and visit Hinata again.</p><p>I didn't know if she'd talk to me like she would to Naruto, but it was worth a shot, particularly if she knew I was asking on his behalf.</p><p>I took flowers this time, and even grabbed an extra one to give to Lee. We weren't exactly friends, but we had made it to the same stage of the Chunin Exams. He was an orphan, so I didn't think he'd have many people visiting him, and there were rumours going around that he was badly injured enough to end his ninja career.</p><p>I doubted that Rock Lee had the common sense to let something like <em> injuries</em> stop him from doing what he wanted.</p><p>I signed in at the reception desk, indicating who I wanted to visit.</p><p>"Rock Lee?" the nurse asked before sighing. "Please, if he's not in his room, let someone know. We've already had to drag him back inside twice today."</p><p>I blinked. "He tries to escape?"</p><p>"Worse. He keeps trying to <em> train</em> ." She sighed again. "It's only aggravating his injuries, but he just wont listen to sense."</p><p>"That… sounds like Lee," I admitted.</p><p>It was a very awkward visit. Lee was very polite, I wasn't sure that he knew how to be anything else, but we didn't have much to talk about once I'd wished him well. The only thing I could think to talk about was the Chunin Exams, and that was just a bit too insensitive for me.</p><p>So I put the vase of flowers on the - previously empty - beside table and fled the room at the first opportunity.</p><p>"Hey, Hinata," I said, knocking gently on the door to her room. "How are you?"</p><p>She blinked, looking up from the book she was reading. I recognised it as one of the ones I'd left here yesterday. "I-I'm well," she said softly. "It's nice to see you again."</p><p>I smiled. "I feel like I have a lot of time on my hands right now," I admitted. "Being that I'm still healing too."</p><p>Because I was still healing, I was only supposed to be doing light exercises. Though, I'm pretty sure that what I was considering 'light' exercise and what the medics actually meant by 'light exercise' were very different things. Eh, I was keeping everything chakra enhanced during training, so chances of rebreaking anything were very slim.</p><p>Hey, I was keeping a careful eye on it. It's not like I <em> liked</em> having broken ribs.</p><p>"Oh, I see," Hinata said. "Have you been doing much?"</p><p>I shrugged, sinking into the visitors chair. "Mostly visiting everyone else," I admitted. "Seeing how everyone is getting on and all. I saw Naruto this morning," I teased, dangling the information in front of her.</p><p>She brightened. "You did? How is he… how is he doing?"</p><p>I hummed. "Not bad, actually. It's really too soon to say how much he'll have improved by the Exams, but its bound to shock a lot of people."</p><p>She smiled, a little bit bashful and a little bit proud. "That's Naruto."</p><p>I grinned. "Sure is. Hey, Hinata? Do you think you could answer some questions for me?" I asked. "I understand if you can't… with clan secrets and all…"</p><p>"Umm," she twisted her fingers together. "I can try."</p><p>I smiled. "Thanks. Really. Umm… I know that the Byakugan can see through things… so my question is; can you see underground?"</p><p>Hinata blinked. "Yes, but… um… it's very difficult to walk when you can't see the ground…"</p><p>"Oh. That actually makes a lot of sense. So you don't tend to look down with the Byakugan unless you already suspect an attack?"</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>So while you probably could surprise a Hyuuga with an attack from below… you'd only get away with it once. It might slow them down a bit to have to constantly check where the ground was, but not that much.</p><p>"Second question… can you see through the Transformation Jutsu?"</p><p>She frowned, as though thinking about it. "Umm… we can tell that there's chakra but… it depends…"</p><p>"So if someone Transformed into, say, a kunai or something…"</p><p>"I-It would have a chakra system, so I'd know that it was a person," Hinata confirmed.</p><p>Hmm… there was a jutsu that created copies of kunai, but I had no idea how it went. But if Naruto created cloned kunai before battle, then they would <em> all </em> have chakra…</p><p>Besides, Naruto's clones were chakra constructs and his Transformation Jutsu changed their shape completely instead of just projecting an image overtop of the real thing.</p><p>"Thanks, Hinata," I murmured. "I know it's kind of awkward for me to ask, but I really think this will help Naruto."</p><p>"I-I'm glad to help Naruto," she said softly, looking down.</p><p>"You're a good person, Hinata," I reassured her before changing the topic. "So how are you liking those books?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next day I packed a cooler bag of food and headed out for Sensei's training camp. It was two hours run at a fast lope, a ground eating, efficient pace. If I was willing to spend chakra I could probably cover it faster, but I didn't know if Sensei expected me to join in on the training so I wanted to conserve energy.</p><p>Sasuke was running through some Taijutsu drills when I arrived, with Sensei standing lazily to the side. I guess that was one benefit of camping in the same place - it didn't give Sensei a chance to be late.</p><p>"Just in time for lunch!" Kakashi-sensei said, clapping his hands together.</p><p>Sasuke blinked, baffled. "Shikako. What are you doing here?"</p><p>I giggled at the look on his face. "You didn't think I was going to let you go for a month with no one but Kakashi-sensei for company, did you? Who knows what that would do to you."</p><p>"Hey!" Sensei objected good naturedly.</p><p>Sasuke smirked. "I can only imagine."</p><p>"Right." I nodded, sharing the amusement. "I brought food," I said, unpacking bentos and thermoses. "There's some extras for dinner, too."</p><p>"Thanks," Sasuke said quietly, taking the box. "I think I'm sick of ration packs and protein bars already."</p><p>I smirked. "One day down, twenty eight to go," I teased.</p><p>He shuddered.</p><p>It was a quiet lunch, but amiable. None of us were exactly talkative people but we were definitely comrades.</p><p>"Are you sticking around?" Sasuke asked me.</p><p>I shrugged and looked at Sensei. "Kakashi-sensei?"</p><p>There was a glint in his eye. "Why, I have the perfect idea! How about a race? I'll time you two."</p><p>"Where to?" Sasuke asked interested.</p><p>"Hmm, oh, I think to the edge of the plateau, down the gully to the last spire and back will be plenty far enough, don't you think?" Sensei said innocently.</p><p>I squinted. "I can't even see the last spire."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei just chuckled.</p><p>Sasuke shrugged and looked at me. "You up for it?"</p><p>I nodded. "Sure. I should be fine to run."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei drew a line in the dirt and we both dropped into runner's crouches behind it. "Ready, steady… GO!"</p><p>We both exploded off the starting line. Chakra flared in my limbs as I ran, boosting my speed. I used it to increase the amount of friction I could grab on the ground, instantaneous grip and release helping me eek out just that bit more speed. The ground flashed past underneath my feet, almost as if I wasn't touching it at all.</p><p>It was… exhilarating.</p><p>I didn't look for Sasuke, content to know that for now he was behind me.</p><p>There were a lot of spires, looming out of the ground as we passed through the canyon. It meant we had to weave around them, which would have been easier if we were going slower. And then they ended. The stretch of sandstone and open space was quite the sight, if I'd taken the time to observe it. I didn't really, sticking one foot to the ground and crouching to pivot around it using my forward momentum to swing around to face the direction that I'd just come from. I was suddenly quite glad for my chakra enhancements as I'd underestimated the G-Forces that would result from the action.</p><p>But it did give me a very tight spin, and a straight shot past Sasuke back to the starting line.</p><p>"Ten minutes and twenty seven seconds," Kakashi-sensei said idly as I cruised over the starting line. I started to bleed off speed, sliding over the ground.</p><p>"And eleven minutes fifteen seconds for you, Sasuke," he added, snapping his stopwatch closed.</p><p>I considered the difference between adult and child, Genin and Jounin. "So it'd take you, what, three or four minutes, Sensei?" I panted.</p><p>"Slightly less, probably," Sensei agreed.</p><p>Sasuke groaned, flopping down onto the ground. "I'm never going to get fast enough."</p><p>"Now, now, Sasuke. It's not time to give up yet," Kakashi-sensei admonished.</p><p>I caught sight of something I hadn't noticed before. "Are you wearing weights, Sasuke?"</p><p>He 'hn'ed in acknowledgement.</p><p>"We probably wont get far with the weights method," Kakashi-sensei said. "It relies on time to adjust to them, which we don't have. Mostly we'll be working on using chakra to enhance your speed. We should be able to get you up to Lee's speed, at least, by the end of the month."</p><p>I wondered if I should invest in weights. Maybe not, they only affected a certain part of the body, and only along with gravity. Maybe, hmm, maybe if I looked into making a resistance seal? To increase the effort needed by <em> all</em> parts of the body, like trying to move in water only without the buoyancy?</p><p>I could already tell that I hadn't been as chakra efficient during the race as I could have been. Not using chakra like that meant I wasn't exactly used to it. It had it's benefits, but I'd have to work on using it <em> sometimes</em> or I'd lose that advantage.</p><p>"Straight line running isn't going to cut it though," I said, thinking out loud. Fighting probably involved very short distance sprints and rapid changes of direction more than long distance races.</p><p>Sensei's eye glinted again. I was starting to think it signified sadistic amusement. "That's right. Next up; agility drills. Or, I guess we could call it… dodge training."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Break: Chapter 28</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - Right, about the ciphers… I meant to clarify about the second book not having them, believe it or not. .' My bad. The first one did, but Jiraiya could recognise the seals because they were basic explosive notes seals and so forth, so he got the gist without having to have the words. I'll bring it up in story later, and we'll say it slipped her mind to mention due to the face palm moment. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 28</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky</em> . <em> ~ Pink Floyd</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I sat, drawing up explosive notes as I thought. They were standard Konoha design, not the most efficient, not the biggest or the most intense, but I was giving these away and no ninja wanted to use an explosive note they didn't trust. So standard Konoha design it was.</p><p>I'd made these so many times that the motions were as familiar as breathing, the calligraphy brush steady between my fingers. There was something infinitely graceful about the slide of the ink over paper and I wondered if this was why some people spent years mastering the art in order to write that one <em> perfect</em> Kanji.</p><p>But mostly, I wondered about seals.</p><p>How to transcribe my thoughts without first converting them to words. How to convey impressions and feelings and intent and <em> will.</em></p><p>Seals could do anything, conventional wisdom said. The trouble was in getting them to do it.</p><p><em> People only think in so many different ways, kid.</em></p><p>Except… thoughts were shaped by society and beliefs and values and all kinds of things. My complete and utter failure to see the point had just highlighted the fact that, while I was integrated in this land, sometimes I was still <em> other</em> .</p><p>Not just that, but sometimes… more often now, after starting to meddle with our spirit energy, sometimes I had the disquieting feeling that all my thoughts had a shadow. An intangible mirror copy just out of reach.</p><p>None of the sealing styles had ever really made intuitive sense to me. That's the whole reason I had tried to puzzle them out by decoding them. I was starting to see why.</p><p>But… it was one thing to <em> say</em> 'create your own seal array' it was another to actually try and do it. How could I possibly <em> create</em> something like that? Everything else I had ever learnt had been learnt by rote. This technique does this. Do this and that will happen.</p><p>It was kinda intimidating.</p><p>I started by pulling out all of the pieces I had used before and seeing which ones made intuitive sense to me. Which techniques worked the best. There was a lot of crossover in the sealing arts, a lot of 'generally accepted' ways of doing things.</p><p>I didn't have to reinvent the wheel, after all. I just had to find the bits that worked for <em> me</em> .</p><p>Actually, now that I thought about it, sealing reminded me a little of studying electricity in physics class. You had to draw a complete circuit, regardless of what you included in it - input, output, measurement, resistors, capacitors… the concepts were remarkably similar.</p><p>It had been a loooong time since I'd done physics.</p><p>Alright, maybe I should start with something simple. My own explosive tag seals - I already knew the theory behind the combustion and I'd studied every variation on them that I could find. And being able to set explosives with a touch would be beyond handy.</p><p>I nodded to myself and finished the tag I was drawing. Then stared at the huge pile that had materialised while I had been thinking.</p><p>"Got a little carried away?" Shikamaru asked dryly.</p><p>"Don't be silly," I said airily. "There's no such thing as too much explosives." Granted, explosive tags were usually fairly expensive and most ninja never used more than one or two per fight. But since I made my own, that didn't matter to me.</p><p>"Just <em> what</em> are you planning to blow up?" he asked. "Because I need to know when to make sure I have an alibi."</p><p>I scoffed and picked a fifth of them off top the pile. "Here," I said, handing them to him. "I'm making sure everyone is restocked. You need any specific tags?"</p><p>Shikamaru 'hmm'ed thoughtfully. "I'll let you know."</p><p>I shrugged. "I think I'm going to make some water storage scrolls, later. You want some?"</p><p>"Could come in handy," Shikamaru agreed.</p><p>"That's what I thought." Against Gaara, against Shino… Naruto could use them for his Hidden in the Mist and in combination with his lightning jutsu. I couldn't help my friends fight, but that didn't mean I couldn't give them the tools they needed.</p><p>Storage scrolls, a personalised explosive seal, some kind of training resistance seal… I was building myself quite a list of things that needed to be done.</p><p>I sighed, and pulled out a new notebook. I sorted them according to what they contained, which meant I had a fair few half finished notebooks floating around, but it was a better system than putting everything in one book which would mean having notes of medical jutsu next to an analysis of chakra recomposition next to a seal array.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Hey, Naruto!" I called, sliding into Ichiraku when I caught sight of the familiar orange jacket. I hadn't intended to come here, but, hey, whatever. "How's training?"</p><p>He jerked. "Ehehe, Shikako! I didn't see you there." He shrugged. "Its going okay. I mean, the toads are cool and all but the pervy sage just keeps wanting me to draw on - I mean, use more chakra and stuff. And Ebisu-sensei is boring, but I can kinda tell I'm improving." He grinned foxily. "And boy was he surprised when I asked for more chakra control techniques."I laughed. "I bet he was. So this is the real you? Not a clone?"</p><p>"Of course! Clones don't need to eat," he said.</p><p>"I know," I teased, smirking. "But I wouldn't put it past some of <em> your</em> clones to sneak off to eat ramen."</p><p>The way he flushed said I probably wasn't too far off the mark.</p><p>"Here," I said handing over an envelope with his share of the explosive notes in it and a copy of my analysis. "These are for your fight. You should probably go over the information with Ebisu-sensei. Just be careful not to lose it. There's stuff on there that you don't want just <em> anybody</em> getting their hands on."</p><p>Naruto glanced at it. "Hey, these are like Kabuto's Nin Info Cards!"</p><p>I twitched. "It is not! It's a detailed report on your opponents skills, strengths and weaknesses with potential strategies to take advantage of them. It's nothing like-"</p><p>"Okay, okay, sorry!" Naruto said, waving his hands back and forth. "It's great. Thanks!"</p><p>I sat back, huffing. "And here I was going to tell you about this awesome new idea that I had about your Shadow Clones… I guess you don't want to hear it."</p><p>"No, wait! Yes I do! Please tell me!" Naruto begged.</p><p>Well. I guess he hadn't <em> meant</em> anything by it. "Oh, alright. Are you free for a bit? Or send a clone with me."</p><p>"I'll come. What is it?" He asked eagerly. "Is it a super cool move that'll help me defeat Neji?"</p><p>"It might be," I said. "It's just an idea. We'll have to see how it works."</p><p>Naruto was very eager to see what I was talking about. I guess describing something as a 'cool idea' was only just slightly below 'cool jutsu' especially since it seemed to use his favourite technique. We headed to one of the simpler training fields which was just basically a kunai range with posts.</p><p>"So," I said. "Why your clones are transformed into things, can they still see and hear?"</p><p>"Yeah. That's how we used the spiders, right?" Naruto said, frowning a little in confusion.</p><p>I hummed. "Yeah, but what if it was something that didn't have eyes and ears? Like, say, a kunai?"</p><p>"Well, I don't know," he confessed.</p><p>"Let's try it," I suggested. He made some clones, with dutifully turned themselves into kunai and then dispersed.</p><p>"Its like…" Naruto wavered. "Kinda like seeing and hearing but not really."</p><p>It wasn't a very clear explanation but I thought I got the point. "But you can tell what's going on, right?"</p><p>He nodded firmly.</p><p>"Good. They are chakra constructs, so I expected something like that. Even when they <em> look</em> like they have eyes and ears they don't really. Okay, so next question. If a clone is transformed into a kunai and then clones <em> himself</em> , do they come out as kunai?"</p><p>"That one is easy," Naruto said confidently. "Yup."</p><p>"I thought so," I said. "Now its demonstration time. Give me a clone transformed into a kunai and be prepared to duplicate ten times when I yell 'now'."</p><p>Naruto frowned, but did as I asked. "I don't really get it," he said. "Where's the cool bit?"</p><p>"Watch this," I directed. I threw the kunai straight for the posts and waited. "NOW!" I yelled, a split second before it hit.</p><p>Ten kunai thunked into the wood. They held for a second, then dispersed, leaving behind ten holes. Strange that Shadow Clones could be solid enough to do damage but not take it. I suspected it had something to do with the fact that pain disrupted chakra. Which might explain why a focused and expectant clone could take hits better than a surprised one.</p><p>"Now imagine if that was a person, expecting one kunai and getting say… ten. Or twenty. Or a hundred," I said. "And then say, even if you missed… your clone kunai could just wait around until Neji - or whoever - stepped near them and turn back and knock them out. Or…"</p><p>I glanced at Naruto. His eyes were very round. "But can't the Byakugan see through the Transformation Jutsu?" he asked slowly.</p><p>"Maybe," I admitted. "So maybe he'll know there's something off about your kunai. But if you make them before you go into the arena he wont know <em> what.</em> And it's like Lee said to Sasuke, isn't it? It doesn't matter if you can <em> see</em> it if you can't do anything about it."</p><p>Oh, Neji would probably be able to deflect hundreds of weapons… but this didn't give him the warning of a flight path when one suddenly doubled into hundreds. He might have Kaiten - the Heavenly Rotation - but that was chakra intensive and I doubted he could use it often.</p><p>"You've got to work on the timing, though," I cautioned. "The closer you can get before they replicate, the less time Neji has to react."</p><p>"You can count on it!" Naruto said, determination beginning to shine. "I wont rest until I've got this down!"</p><p>He summoned another clone and it transformed even as he reached for it. I stepped back to watch.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The days drifted away, slowly at first, then faster and faster often with little to show for their passing. I studied. I trained. I spoke to the others. And every three days I packed up lunch and went to make sure Sasuke was still alive.</p><p>I struggled with the seals. Oh, I could make explosive seals by the dozens, functional seals, efficient ones, but they still weren't <em> right.</em> Then, one afternoon, I stared down at the paper in my notebook and wondered why it suddenly seemed so <em> obvious.</em></p><p>It was simple. A triskelion - three spirals that joined to form the sides of a triangle - with the kanji for blast in the centre and the details - radius, intensity, timer - scribed out in English with adjustable numerical attributes. It was remarkably simple, yet highly adaptable. Bigger explosions, smaller ones, extreme heat, delayed activation… I could change it all, something that sometimes annoyed me with standard tags.</p><p>"Now to make sure it works," I said thoughtfully. It didn't look like any other explosive seal I'd ever seen, apparent from the single central kanji, but that was kinda the point. I drew out a few seals, took them down to the training fields and watch in elation as they blew up.</p><p>I wanted to cackle madly. I wanted to run around and show people what I'd done. Naruto! I could show Naruto.</p><p>"No, no, wait," I murmured to myself. "First…"</p><p>First, I wanted to learn how to apply it. Learn how to use it without having to draw up the ink first.</p><p><em> It's just trappings,</em> Jiraiya's voice echoed. <em> You have to own your seals, mind and soul.</em></p><p>I remembered Naruto, slamming his hand down into the ground, the delicate webbing of black ink spreading from his fingers.</p><p><em> What's the correlation?</em></p><p>I closed my eyes and focused on the pattern of the seal, filling in the numbers I wanted. I slammed my hand down onto the ground, a surge of chakra and a twist of <em> my will be done!</em></p><p>Beneath my hand bloomed the ink of my explosive seal, perfect and lethal.</p><p>"Bugger," I said.</p><p>I dove to the side.</p><p>The explosion sent me tumbling and I rolled across the grass, laughing breathlessly and unharmed. "Didn't <em> quite</em> think that one through. Note to self…"</p><p>I was giddy with success. For all that it was such a small thing, almost unnecessary even, it was still progress beyond what I'd hoped for.</p><p>"Naruto!" I called excitedly, searching the training field that he'd last occupied with Jiraiya.</p><p>Naruto was standing on the head of a giant frog, easily one the size of a small cow. He perked up when he saw me.</p><p>"Oh, hey, Shikako! Have you come to talk to the pervy sage again?"</p><p>I beamed at him. "No! I wanted to show you something."</p><p>"Really?" He jumped down to land beside me, the toad dismissing itself in a puff of smoke. I wondered if they were getting annoyed with him. "Is it another cool technique?"</p><p>"It's something I learnt to do," I said. "Oh, just watch!" I stooped down and grabbed a small rock, one just the size of my fist, off the ground. The twist of chakra and will power came easily, again, as if something had just clicked. And because I was showing off, I upped the intensity of the explosion.</p><p>Ink webbed across the rock.</p><p>I cocked my arm back and threw it high into the air. When it reached the peak of it's flight, it exploded, a muffled 'whump' of fire, burning almost white hot at the centre.</p><p>I beamed at Naruto, proud as anything.</p><p>"That. Was. Amazing!" Naruto shouted, grabbing me and spinning me around. "It was - you just - then it exploded!"</p><p>I laughed. I wasn't entirely sure Naruto understood what I'd just done, but that was the nice thing about Naruto. He'd be excited with you anyway.</p><p>"Oi, brat! Quit messing around with explosives! You scared all the ladies off," Jiraiya popped up, aggrieved. "Oh, it's your <em> lady friend.</em> Come to see Jiraiya again, hehehe?" He leered.</p><p>"Don't say it like that!" Naruto shouted.</p><p>"Jiraiya-sama," I said, bowing a little. "Sorry for disturbing you. I was just showing Naruto what I'd managed to do."</p><p>"And here I thought you said you already knew how to make explosive tags," Jiraiya said shrewdly.</p><p>"Uh, yes, I do. I mean, that's why I started with them because I already know how…" Hrm, that line of logic seemed better in my head.</p><p>"Do it again!" Naruto instructed, shoving a rock into my hand. "Watch this, pervy sage, it's awesome!"</p><p>I did so. Naruto's eyes followed the explosion, but Jiraiya's rested on me, heavy and inscrutable.</p><p>"Well, it's a good thing you showed up, anyway," Jiraiya said, pulling out a familiar looking notebook. "How long have you been working on this?"</p><p>"Uh, since just after graduation." He gave me an incredulous look. "What? We had a mission to do as well," I added defensively. I hadn't had <em> that</em> long to work on it.</p><p>"That's not what I… oh, never mind. How many more of these notebooks do you have?" He asked.</p><p>"A few. I work on stuff other than sealing as well, you know. The rest are mostly encrypted though."</p><p>"I noticed that," Jiraiya said. The look he gave the book said he would very dearly like to work out that code. Whether because he wanted to read what it said, or simply as a professional code breaker I didn't know. "Why isn't this one?"</p><p>"I …uh… didn't encrypt that book because its an analysis. I wanted… I wanted to have it put in the clan library later." I looked down. It was pretty arrogant to think I deserved to have anything entered into the clan library, but it wasn't like it was a <em> creation</em> of mine. It was just collating and analysing the work of others. Anyone could have done it. "The rest are in code. And I don't really want to give you a chance to break it."</p><p>Some ninja were scary smart. There were people who probably <em> could</em> rediscover an entire language based on whatever clues they could find in my notebooks. And there would be some - seal patterns, diagrams, graphs… there was always something.</p><p>And I wasn't even <em> entirely</em> sure no one spoke English anywhere. Certainly, it wasn't a major language of any of the Elemental Nations, but all it took was a small regional town to have their own dialect (or even worse, outside the Elemental Nations) and all of a sudden there would be massive attention focused on me.</p><p>"Fair enough, fair enough," Jiraiya said, scratching his chin. "Well, we might as well go over this now. Brat! Get back to work!" He flicked the notebook over, revealing that he'd stuck post-it-notes all throughout the book, covered with cramped handwriting. "Now see here…"</p><p>There was a reason that Jiraiya was considered a Seal Master. Possibly <em> The</em> Seal Master, depending on who you asked. I was getting just a very small glimpse of that, with his additions and corrections and embellishments to my analysis. I had thought that I had gone into detail, but there was so much <em> more</em> …</p><p>The fact that he was teaching it to me, sharing this knowledge, was so much more than I could have hoped for. I'd basically accepted that tipping my entire perspective upside down was the most that I was going to get out of him. Maybe get him to answer a few more questions.</p><p>This was a treasure trove.</p><p>It was a good day.</p><p>So of course, it couldn't last. Pride comes before the fall and all that. I was still giddy with success when we settled in for our nightly training/meditation. Two weeks of this and nothing to show for it. But Dad cautioned us to expect nothing else and not to get anxious about it.</p><p>I don't know what it was. Maybe because I wasn't as calm and bored as usual. Maybe my shift in perspective. Maybe a lot of things.</p><p>Because when we settled in, when I started <em> looking</em> into my shadow… I saw it.</p><p>Just a tiny spot. A spark of darkness where the shadow was so much greater and <em> deeper</em> than that around it. The shadow was so dark it seemed solid, a grasping, living entity so deep that not even light could escape.</p><p>I reached for it.</p><p>Then - suddenly - something was pulling me back, dragging me away from the dark emptiness of that deep black.</p><p>"Come on, sweetheart," Dad was murmuring, crouched in front of me, hands on my shoulders. I could feel the chakra flowing through them, but it seemed… muted, somehow. "Back up, that's a good girl. Best not to go so fast, eh?"</p><p>I blinked slowly. Once, twice, and again. The world seemed … far less bright, less sharp than usual, as though I was looking through fog. It seemed almost… distant, like everything was a long way away. Like I was looking through a tunnel or a telescope.</p><p>"Shikako?" Shikamaru asked, voice sharp. I heard it clearly and yet…</p><p>"Don't fuss, brother-mine," I said, though my voice sounded bland and lacking inflection, even to me. Vaguely, I was aware that that should have worried me. It didn't.</p><p>That should have worried me too.</p><p>"What's wrong with her?" Shikamaru demanded.</p><p>Dad cast him a look. "She went too far. Now do you see why this is so dangerous?"</p><p>Shikamaru swallowed. "But she'll be okay, right?" He looked worried. I felt a small spark of regret, deep inside, at causing him worry.</p><p>"I feel very cold," I observed, but it was a distant concern, as though everything was so very far away.</p><p>"I think that's enough for tonight," Dad said. "It'll probably take you a few days to … unwind a bit."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Break: Chapter 29</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: After mentioning that messing with your spirit energy was dangerous, I wanted to highlight that by it <em> actually being dangerous.</em> Unfortunately for her, Shikako doesn't have a 'main character exception' card, like most of them do when using dangerous techniques. Get careless with it, you'll get messed up.</p><p>Also Moka-girl made the point that there <em> are</em> romanji letters around Konoha. Which sort of implies that there might be other, non Japanese languages out there. Hmm. Then again, Japanese in the Naruto-verse might just have evolved with another set of characters because, hey, hiragana, katakana and kanji sometimes aren't enough. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 29</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The sea has neither meaning nor pity. ~Anton Chekhov</em></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I blinked awake slowly. Sunlight was streaming in through the window, creeping warm fingers over my bed. Usually I was up and gone before the angle of light got that far.</p><p>I didn't move.</p><p>The warmth was distant. I knew it was there, could feel it on my skin and yet… inside I still felt cold. It didn't touch me.</p><p>"Shikako! Wake up! You're missing breakfast." My door banged open, Mum standing poised in the doorway. I turned my neck to look at her. "Oh, you are awake." She sounded unnerved. There was an awkward pause before she drew herself back together. "Well, what are you waiting for? Hurry up."</p><p>I stood and dressed and pulled my hair back into it's usual plait. The movements felt mechanical and awkward.</p><p><em> Is this what it means…</em></p><p>The consequences of mistakes when using the shadow jutsu had been highlighted, but no one had ever described how it <em> felt</em> . This empty, distant feeling. Quietude. Listlessness.</p><p><em> Like standing in shadow…</em></p><p>I drifted downstairs.</p><p>"Finally," Shikamaru said, glancing up at me. "Why'd you get to sleep in? I've already been up to feed the deer."</p><p>I took my seat at the table. I didn't feel hungry but this was routine and I could see no reason to change it. "You should have woken me. I would have helped," I replied. There was no difference at the thought of waking earlier or later, doing work or doing nothing. It just… barely mattered.</p><p>Shikamaru's face faded into an uneasy look. I tried to smile at him, but my facial muscles felt stiff and uncooperative.</p><p>"Best if you don't do anything until you're back to normal," Dad said gently. "No training, no ninja techniques, no wandering off on your own. At least for today."</p><p>I tilted my head to the side. "I was intending to visit Sasuke today," I said. It had been three days since my last visit.</p><p>"That's not really a good idea," Mum said. "I'm sure it wont matter if you miss a visit or two."</p><p>I shrugged one shoulder. It wouldn't, not exactly. I was aware, though, that Kakashi-sensei and Sasuke would probably be concerned, as they would be expecting me.</p><p>"Why don't you go with Shikamaru?" Mum suggested to fill the silence. "And go and see Chouji or Ino or something?"</p><p>I blinked. "Aren't you training this morning?" I asked.</p><p>"Dad did just say you couldn't," Shikamaru replied.</p><p>"That doesn't mean you can't," I responded. "And you are the one with a match coming up."</p><p>I could think, perfectly well, and reason things out logically. I could act and react. I could move. I wasn't any <em> different</em> .</p><p>Except… everything seemed so distant, so muted, so … unimportant.</p><p>Smothered, maybe. Suffocated.</p><p>"You wont get bored?" Shikamaru asked dubiously. "Just watching?"</p><p>"No," I said. Boredom? That implied the desire for other actions. And while I was aware that that should have been a reaction to being forbidden to pursue my normal activities, it wasn't an issue right now.</p><p>"If you say so," Shikamaru muttered.</p><p>"Oh for gods sake!" Mum shouted suddenly, banging her fist on the table and half standing. "How can you just act like this is <em> normal?</em> "</p><p>Shikamaru jerked, eyes flaring wide open with shock and panic. He sat very still, so as not to attract her attention.</p><p>"Yoshino," Dad said. "Don't get so upset."</p><p>"Don't get so upset? Don't get so <em> upset?</em> Your daughter is acting like… like-" her hand cut through the air sharply. "Like a machine! Why are you not <em> upset?</em> "</p><p>"You know there are dangers to using our clan techniques," he said. "This is one of them. Manipulating your own spiritual energy is not done lightly, or easily. There are <em> risks</em> involved. You're very wrong if you think I'm taking this casually. But there was no harm done. Yes, you can irreparably damage yourself like that but this is just a temporary state, like a fever, while her spiritual energy sorts itself back out. I was watching them, Yoshino, I wouldn't-" his voice faltered, just very briefly. "I wouldn't let anything happen to them."</p><p>Mum deflated like he'd taken the wind out of her sails. In a way, he had. For all her temper, Dad was very good at diffusing her.</p><p>"I worry about them enough when they're on missions," she sighed. "I don't want to have to worry about them when they're sitting right in front of me."</p><p>"They're good kids, Yoshi," Dad said gently. "They can take care of themselves."</p><p>She slumped forwards, just a little, then marshalled herself. "Not with that Taijutsu, they can't," she decreed, waving a spoon in Shikamaru's direction.</p><p>"Aww, not Taijutsu," Shikamaru whined. Taijutsu was his least favourite of all the shinobi arts and he preferred to avoid it as much as possible. I suspected that was because it demanded a large amount of movement.</p><p>Dad leaned back in his chair, watching the argument with a fond smile gracing his lips. He caught my eye and it turned a little sad, but remained all the same.</p><p>I nodded. Then got up and followed Mum and Shikamaru out the door, seating myself on the veranda to watch them train.</p><p>I suppose, another word for how I felt might be 'peaceful'.</p><p>"Come on," Shikamaru said when they were done, yawning and slouching. He wasn't <em> quite</em> looking at me. "I'm meeting Asuma-sensei and Chouji at the barbeque place."</p><p>I nodded and stood.</p><p>Shikamaru reached out and grabbed my hand, lacing our fingers together. It wasn't uncommon, but usually I was the one to do it so I could better tug him along. He didn't look at me, didn't give any indication that it was out of the ordinary for him to do, just started walking.</p><p>I followed.</p><p>'The barbeque place' had a name, but since it was one of Chouji's favourite eateries and pretty much the most common place for Team 10 to meet, it was just 'the barbeque place'. They all knew where they were talking about.</p><p>"Hey, Shikamaru!" Chouji's cheerful voice called as we entered the building. "You're late. Even Ino is here, already!"</p><p>"Sorry, sorry," Shikamaru drawled, heading for the booth where his team was. "Something came up. Hope you guys don't mind that I brought my sister with me."</p><p>Ino's head popped up over the edge of the booth. "Shikako! Boy am I glad to see you. Maybe between the two of us we can convince Chouji to switch out some of the pork for salad, ne?"</p><p>"Ino," I said, nodding my head in greeting. "Chouji."</p><p>Even with such a small greeting, they were looking at me oddly as Shikamaru nudged me into the booth. Asuma-sensei's eyes were alert. As a ninja, we were <em> always</em> cautious of people who had suddenly changed. Impostors, breakdowns… there were a whole host of reasons why it might be a bad sign. Asuma-sensei didn't know me, but Ino and Chouji did, and he was observing their reactions.</p><p>"Alright there?" Asuma-sensei asked casually, but his eyes were watching us sharply.</p><p>"I had an accident in training," I said placidly. It was the truth, more or less.</p><p>"Yeah," Shikamaru drawled uneasily. I was sorry that my actions, my words, were causing him discomfort. "Dad says she's on lockdown for a while. No training. So…" he shrugged.</p><p>"A training accident?" Ino asked speculatively. "That sucks. Those can really mess up your whole day."</p><p>I'd considered that the Yamanaka and Nara jutsu were more closely related than previously thought, but I still wasn't sure I wanted to know what kind of 'training accident' could result from the Mind-Body Switch Jutsu.</p><p>"Yeah, that sucks," Chouji empathised. "Want some barbeque?" In Chouji's world, things improved with food. It wasn't so much a change of topic as an offer to help.</p><p>Breakfast had been hours ago and I could smell the cooking meat on the hot plate, but I didn't feel particularly hungry.</p><p>"You should eat," Shikamaru said, nudging the chopsticks by my hand.</p><p>Obediently, I picked them up. The movements were soothing and repetitive. Reach, grab, move, chew. Reach, grab, move, chew. The motions were identical each time. Exact and efficient.</p><p>"She's not going to <em> stay</em> like this, is she?" I heard Chouji asking quietly.</p><p>"I hope not," Shikamaru replied.</p><p>Ino did what she does best and started chattering, about the new flowers they'd got in, about the people that had stopped by the Flower Shop recently, about juicy pieces of gossip she'd picked up.</p><p>"… and Lee, you remember him? They're saying that his career as a shinobi is over. That he did himself so much damage with the gates that he'll never fight again…" Her mouth twisted down, voice taking a more sombre tone. "That's… really sad, isn't it? I mean, its not like we knew him, or anything, but he seemed so… determined."</p><p>"I visited him at the hospital," I said. "He's always out in the practice fields. It frustrates the nurses."</p><p>"Some one like that isn't going to give up just because things are painful," Asuma-sensei said. It was a little prod at his team, who were more likely to give up than fight.</p><p>Shikamaru scoffed and rested his chin in his hand. "And sometimes knowing where your limits are is more important."</p><p>"Yes," I agreed quietly.</p><p>"Moderation, that's the key," Asuma-sensei said with the tone of someone imparting great and sage knowledge. "Too much of one… too much of the other, it's equally as bad."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, whatever," Shikamaru replied, completely unimpressed in the way only teenagers can be.</p><p>"Maybe you should 'moderate' your cigarettes then," Ino suggested. "Or, stop them all together, that would be much better."</p><p>His hand hovered protectively over his flack jacket pocket, presumably where he kept his cigarettes. "When you kids get to Jounin, you can tell me to back off the cigarettes then. Can't guarantee I'll listen, but I think you'll have other things to worry about by then."</p><p>"I would hope Kurenai-sensei would have you weaned off them by then," Ino said.</p><p>"I- what? What's she got to do with this?" Asuma-sensei yelped.</p><p>Ino giggled. "You're dating, aren't you?" Ino kept up with the gossip, something like <em> that</em> would not slip past her. "You should give her some flowers. We have some nice roses in at the moment. Red, oooh, or maybe some lovely white ones."</p><p>Red for passion and true love or white for eternal love, purity and secrecy. Together they spoke of unity. Ino was <em> meddling.</em></p><p>Asuma-sensei took out another cigarette and pointed it at her severely. "<em> We</em> are just friends," he said firmly. "So get that idea out of your head."</p><p>"You can give friends flowers too," Ino said sagely, not at all put off. "Yellow roses stand for friendship and joy."</p><p>"Keep that up and I'll come up with new drills for you," Asuma-sensei warned. "Something involving running. Lots of it."</p><p>Ino huffed. "Jeeze, don't get so touchy. I think its sweet."</p><p>"Thank you for your approval," Asuma-sensei said dryly. "And <em> moving on…</em> "</p><p>"Man, that was good barbeque," Chouji said, almost on cue. "I am so ready for training! Are you coming with us, Shikako?"</p><p>"I am not supposed to be alone," I said, which was confirmation in its own way.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next day was better, in a way.</p><p>I was aware enough of how I was feeling to know it was abnormal, a degree of self reflection that I hadn't had before.</p><p>It… ached.</p><p>Like feeling alone in a crowd, like being separated from the outside world by a glass wall. It would have been a good time to see if, without my emotions clouding my mind, I could think clearer, learn better… but I found my motivation lacking. Without my fear of the future, the desire to protect my family, it just seemed so pointless.</p><p>Emotions made you what you were.</p><p>"Better today?" Dad asked, sitting beside me on the veranda as we watched Shika and Mum spar. He cradled a cup of green tea between his hands.</p><p>I hummed in agreement. "I think I see why no one strives for this state," I said.</p><p>"Some do," Dad admitted. "When you're older… have been through more… you'll probably see the attraction. But it's a hard balance to find - just enough to shock you, not enough to harm you - and most outcomes are much worse than the things that could drive you there. It's not a good coping mechanism."</p><p>"I see," I said.</p><p>Dad sipped his tea. "Have you got anything planned for the day?"</p><p>I considered it. My motivation for training was low, but I could read. I had plenty of fiction books and some of what I was learning was interesting beyond its usefulness anyway. "I could… go and visit Hinata. And Sakura."</p><p>Dad looked pleased at the suggestion. "It's good that you're reaching out to your friends. That's… a good sign."</p><p>I smiled, and it felt less stiff and awkward than before, though still unnatural. "I could go visit Sasuke," I added.</p><p>He regarded me closely. "Do you think that's a good idea?" He asked.</p><p>"It's not that far away and the route is fairly safe," I said. "I wont train with them but… I know they'll be worried."</p><p>And the fact that I didn't want them to be worried meant that I was getting better.</p><p>Dad nodded. "Alright. Stay safe."</p><p>"I will."</p><p>The trip out was easy, mindless running along a familiar path. It took me longer than usual because I stuck to the ground rather than going through the trees, obeying the 'no ninja techniques' rule.</p><p>They must have noticed me coming because both Sasuke and Kakashi-sensei were waiting when I showed up.</p><p>"It's been more than three days. I thought something had happened," Sasuke said, relief seeping into his voice. It wasn't much, but it was noticeable.</p><p>"I apologise," I said. "It was not my intention to cause you worry."</p><p>His eyes sharpened, roving over my face. "Are you okay?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei was frowning, or as much as I could tell.</p><p>I tilted my head slightly. "I am uninjured. I suffered an accident in training which rendered me incapable of travelling here."</p><p>Sasuke hesitated still. "What's Team 7 Rule One?"</p><p>I blinked slowly at the odd, out of place question. "No dying," I answered. Perhaps he thought I was an impostor? Without someone here to vouch for me it was a legitimate concern. "The bridge was named 'The Great Naruto Bridge', Kakashi-sensei gave us the bell test, we started with a Heaven Scroll… um…"</p><p>"Okay, I believe you," he said, glancing at Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>I attempted a smile. "I brought lunch," I offered.</p><p>Sasuke took the bag carefully and we all sat. I ate mechanically.</p><p>"So, what happened?" he asked eventually, breaking the stiff silence.</p><p>I considered what to say. By rights, it was a clan secret and I shouldn't say anything more. On the other hand, this was my team and there were parallels…</p><p><em> How much can I explain without giving anything away?</em></p><p>"There's a lot of debate bout what concepts like 'mind' and 'soul' and 'mental energy' <em> really</em> mean, but everyone agrees that they're influenced by chakra. So if something is affecting your chakra, it's affecting <em> you</em> . Your mind, your soul, your core personality… whatever it is that makes you, you," I said at length, trying to explain without <em> actually explaining.</em> "And so, some techniques are dangerous to learn. Not just physically, but…" I pressed my hand to my heart.</p><p>Sasuke froze, chopsticks suspended halfway to his mouth. "What?" he rasped.</p><p>I noticed that Kakashi-sensei had sharpened his attention.</p><p>"When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you. When you step into the shadow, the shadow steps into you. If you push too far, too fast, if you aren't absolutely sure of who you are…and it will swallow you whole. Then you can lose pieces of yourself."</p><p>Sasuke swallowed heavily, eyes darting around my face.</p><p>"We call it 'falling into the black'," I continued.</p><p>"And you…" he trailed off, unable to complete the thought.</p><p>"This is only temporary," I said, trying to reassure him. "I'm much better today than I was yesterday. Next time you see me, I should be back to normal."</p><p>"That's… that's good. Right?" he asked.</p><p>I nodded. "Mmm. This state is … unsuited to being a ninja."</p><p>"Why?" Sasuke asked. "You'd think…" he looked at me uneasily. You'd think being emotionless is a state to strive for, I knew he meant to say.</p><p>I stared blindly into my bento. "I am not hungry, so I will not eat. I am not tired, so I will not sleep. I am not afraid… so I will not fight. Motivation is… difficult." It was only routines that meant I had so far, the fact that others around me were doing so.</p><p>"That wouldn't matter to some," Kakashi-sensei said, almost to himself. "As long as a soldier followed orders…"</p><p>"Why should I follow orders?" I countered, voice low. "There is no reason for it." Punishment for disobeying? To protect people? For the village?</p><p>Meaningless.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei shook himself. "So this is temporary?" he asked.</p><p>I nodded. "Yes. I will be more careful next time."</p><p>And yes, after that, Shikamaru and I were much more careful when training with our affinities.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Eh, I wanted to cover so much with this chapter and I feel like I missed all of it… This chapter made me depressed. :(</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Break: Chapter 30</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - I think a few people were expecting the same - trained killer minus pesky moral obligations - but I see Shikako as fairly introverted so she just got progressively quieter. It gives a bit of a new spin on the Nara laziness, ne? Genetically inherited indeed. The 'forbidden from training' point was half to do with that; on one hand, she might hurt herself and not care, on the other, she might create horribly morally lacking techniques ala mad scientist. And if there <em> was</em> a fight, well, she <em> claimed</em> to not be afraid, but that might not hold up under stress. It wasn't a complete shut down, after all. And, yes, she will have to deal with <em> that. </em> Mwhahaha.</p><p>Pokey - It's okay, I understand by what you meant by 'more'. I intended to have <em> more</em> but… well, that's the difference between intention and execution.</p><p>And also? Wikipedia Shogi Tactics for the win.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 30</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. ~Friedrich Nietzsche</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I clicked the pawn down onto the shogi board, completing my Yagura Castle - arguably the strongest defensive formation in the entire game. Contrary to expectations, the opening game of shogi revolved around building a good defence before you could attack, mainly because of the ability to drop tiles at any location on the board - rapidly advancing your pieces left you open for attack.</p><p>"Defend the king with three generals," Shikamaru quoted the old proverb with a sigh. "Oh man. And here I thought we were going to have an easy game." Despite his tone, his eyes were eager as he advanced his rook's knight.</p><p>"It's not like we don't have the time," I replied, gaze flickering to the hospital bed that we sat beside. "Naruto's been out for <em> days</em> already. The idiot."</p><p>"Maybe the kid croaked," Shikamaru suggested.</p><p>I scoffed. "It'll take more than chakra exhaustion to take out Naruto. Though I seriously want to hear the story of how <em> Naruto</em> got chakra exhaustion." And <em> really,</em> to get chakra exhaustion so close to the Finals…</p><p>Shikamaru shrugged. "Hey, you're the one who told me about the rumours you heard. I know nothing about it."</p><p>"How could you <em> miss</em> the giant toad leaping around on the horizon?" I shook my head. "Never mind, you were probably cloud watching."</p><p>"You don't tell Mum, I don't tell Mum," he replied.</p><p>"Tell her what?" I teased. "That you're skiving training to play shogi with me in the hospital?"</p><p>"Hey, my training buddy is here too. I can't do much without Chouji."</p><p>"Sure, sure," I said. "I'm sure Asuma-sensei couldn't come up with <em> anything.</em> "</p><p>Naruto groaned and stirred.</p><p>"Seriously?" Shikamaru asked rhetorically. "You've been out for days and you pick <em> now</em> to wake up?" he scowled at the shogi board.</p><p>"Where am I?" Naruto muttered, sounding lost and disorientated. "What is this?"</p><p>"The hospital," Shikamaru replied drolly. "They said you've been out cold like this for three days straight."</p><p>Naruto blinked and sat up, scrubbing his eyes. "Huh."</p><p>"Nice to see you awake, sleepyhead," I teased. "I thought you were going to miss the Finals."</p><p>"Wait! What? How many days did you say it had been?" Naruto shouted, jumping up on the bed.</p><p>"Oh man, this kid gives me such a headache. I liked him a lot better when he was in a coma," Shikamaru muttered, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>"Naruto! Calm down," I directed, ignoring my brother's comment. "You've still got a few days."</p><p>"I need to be out there training!" Naruto said. "I can't believe I wasted so much time!"</p><p>"Would you knock it off?" Shikamaru said, exasperated. "Now listen, you don't want to be freaking out the day before a big competition. Resting can be the best thing."</p><p>"You don't want to be tired before your fight with Neji, do you?" I added, trying to reinforce the point.</p><p>"I guess not," Naruto muttered, sinking back down on the bed. "Ugh. I'm really starving."</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>"Well," Shikamaru drawled, setting a fruit basket on the bed. "I went to all the trouble of getting this stuff for Chouji, and then the doctors told me he couldn't have it. That's such a drag. But at least we can eat it."</p><p>"Chouji? You mean he's here in the hospital too?" Naruto asked, wide eyed.</p><p>"Nothing to worry about. All he's got is a bad case of indigestion. He ate one short rib too many." It was said in good humour. A kind of 'that's Chouji'.</p><p>"Hehehe," Naruto giggled. "That's just like him." He reached out to pick up an apple then froze, a wicked grin lighting up his face. "I know, we can totally go and eat it in front of him. It'll drive him crazy!"</p><p>"That's so mean," Shikamaru said. "I like it."</p><p>When he bothered to use it, Shikamaru's sense of humour leaned more to the sharp, sly kind. He had actually laughed at most of Naruto's pranks at the Academy, even if he hadn't been as loud as Kiba about it.</p><p>"It's this way," Shikamaru said, leading us through the hallways.</p><p>But as we drew nearer to Chouji's room, I became unsettled. "It's awfully quiet," I commented uneasily.</p><p>"It <em> is </em> lunchtime," Shikamaru commented, but I noticed that his shoulders were equally tense.</p><p>I reached out with my chakra sense, momentarily bewildered at the fluctuations of chakra from the various medical seal work and machinery. I didn't quite know what I was looking for, but I found it in the dark, agitated chakra coming from one of the far rooms.</p><p><em> Lee's room?</em></p><p>I sprinted down the hallways, Shikamaru and Naruto blinking in surprise before following me. I didn't know what was happening, but it couldn't be good.</p><p>Because I was pretty sure the chakra I was sensing was Gaara.</p><p>I skidded around the corner, banging the door open and charging into the room, Naruto and Shikamaru half a step behind me. It probably would have been horribly embarrassing if I'd judged the situation wrong, but by the way that Gaara's sand was climbing all over the bed and the sleeping Lee, I didn't think I had.</p><p>Shika and I both lashed out with our shadows, catching Gaara at almost the same time. It was the oddest feeling. We'd never both targeted the same person because, well, there wasn't any point to it. I could feel Gaara through it, and he was appropriately paralysed, but I could also feel the link back to Shikamaru and I knew that if I pushed, I could try and paralyse him too. Of course, he'd be able to do the same to me and in the end it would probably come down to who had stronger chakra and greater will. But Gaara was torn between us, fighting a double layer of Shadow Possession Jutsu. That would, however, last only as long as we were in synch with each other. If I moved and Shikamaru didn't, we'd be weakening each other.</p><p><em> Interesting.</em></p><p>"My hand… I can't move my hand," Gaara rasped, hand poised over Lee's bed in the half curled fist that he used for his Sand Coffin.</p><p>With an awareness born from years of closeness, Shikamaru and I both turned, moving Gaara away from the bed to face us.</p><p>"What the heck do you think you're doing in here, you rat!" Naruto shouted, half questioning, half demanding.</p><p>"Is there a problem here, Gaara of the desert?" Eh, I sort of wished he had a last name. That didn't sound <em> nearly</em> as authoritative as it could have. "Use of chakra techniques is prohibited in the hospital."</p><p>Shika gave me a <em> look</em> like 'it's pretty damn obvious he was trying to <em> kill</em> him. You think tell him it's <em> forbidden</em> is going to work?'</p><p>Well, okay, no. But I wasn't <em> good</em> at verbal confrontations. And reminding Gaara that there were people other than us that wouldn't like this might have done <em> something.</em></p><p>"I was going to kill him," Gaara said, blankly, calmly, like he had every right.</p><p>The statement made us all real.</p><p>"You already beat him once in the competition," Shikamaru retorted. "What's your problem? Wasn't that enough for you? Do you have some kind of personal grudge against him or something?" There was a hard edge of anger in his voice that didn't show up often.</p><p>"I have nothing against him. It's nothing that complicated. I simply want to kill him, that's all." Again, said so calmly. His green eyes were blank. Admittedly, it was probably better than homicidal rage, but disturbing all the same.</p><p>"You think we're just going to stand by and let you do whatever you want?" Shikamaru asked in disbelief. "Not going to happen."</p><p>"If you don't stay out of my way," Gaara replied. "I'll have to kill you as well."</p><p>I felt my breath catch. Oh, I'd studied Gaara's attacks and defence. I'd worked out battle strategies. But this was <em> not</em> an ideal location for fighting - a small enclosed space, helpless patients, Naruto wasn't armed in any way (he wasn't even wearing shoes!), I wasn't carrying my specially prepared waters scrolls… it was not looking good.</p><p>"Oh, yeah? Well lets just see you try it!" Naruto challenged. On one hand I wanted to face palm, on the other it was so <em> Naruto</em> that I had been expecting it.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, we watched your last match against Lee. We know you're tough. But we have a few tricks up our sleeves as well. On top of that, its three against one. So don't be a fool, okay? Just take my advice and go. Quietly." Shikamaru was bluffing. He wasn't any keener to get into a fight here than I was.</p><p>Against a normal, sane person, it might have even worked.</p><p>"I'll say it once more," Gaara repeated. "If you get in my way, I'll kill you."</p><p>"And I'll say it again," Naruto repeated, equally fierce. "Lets see you try it!"</p><p>"Back off!" Shikamaru hissed at him, not as used to Naruto jumping in over his head, feet first and whooping with joy, as I was. "We don't wanna go there! This guy fights like he's mad. Like he's a demon or something."</p><p>An odd look came over Naruto's face. "He can act like a demon if he wants to, but you know what? I got the real thing inside of me!" He glared at Gaara.</p><p>I was surprised at even the oblique reference. Maybe that was an opening I could use to talk about it. Later.</p><p>"A demon, huh? My demon is as real as yours is," Gaara rasped. "From my birth, my upbringing was not what most people would consider a happy one. In order to ensure I became the strongest of shinobi, my father infused my unborn self with a sand spirit. I destroyed the life of the woman who gave birth to me. I was born a monster. It's name is Shukaku and it's the living incarnation of a monk of the Sand village who had been sealed up in a jar of tea."</p><p>Shukaku, yes. Monk? No. Then again, why tell the Jinchuriki the truth. Not like it would help them stay in control or anything, right?</p><p>"That's awful," I said.</p><p>"Man, that's creepy," Shikamaru said, shuddering. "Gee, what a swell guy your dad must have been. He really must have loved you a lot."</p><p>"You speak of 'love'. Don't measure me by your standards. Love. Family. The only emotional ties I have to my family are the ones I like to wrap around their necks. And they're only ties of hate. Given life by the death of my mother and nurtured into being, I was the salvation of my village. I was the Kazekage's child. My father taught me the inner most secrets of the shinobi. He pampered and protected me and left me to myself. For a time, I thought that was love. And that was when everything started."</p><p>Maybe Gaara really wanted to tell people about this, to justify himself. He was really monologuing here.</p><p>"When <em> what</em> started?" Naruto demanded, swallowing. His face was pale. He was obviously seeing parallels here.</p><p>"Ever since I became six years old… my father tried to destroy me more times than I can count!"</p><p>"You just finished saying how your father pampered and protected you. So which is it?" Shikamaru demanded.</p><p>"Those who become too strong are apt to become feared. The jutsu that gave me birth had unbalanced something in my mind. Even the fools in my village realised I had… emotional problems." His voice twisted on the last words, wry and bitter and full or dark humour.</p><p>Depending on what Gaara meant by 'inner most secrets of the shinobi' it might not be <em> just</em> the Ichibi's fault. I doubted the Kazekage taught <em> kindly</em> .</p><p>"My father, the Kazekage, created me as his ultimate weapon. But I eventually became a threat to the very village I was meant to save. By the time I was six I became a figure of terror to the villagers. To them, I was a relic of the past that they wished would disappear. So you see, I had failed at the one purpose for which I was given life. What then, was left for me in this existence? Why go on living? For a long time, I couldn't find an answer to that, but in order to live, you need a purpose. To exist for no reason… it's the same as being dead."</p><p>It was … spellbinding, listening to him talk. Horrible and awful and still managing to hold us entranced.</p><p>"Then in time, the answer came to me. To put it simply, my reason for living is in the killing of others. For years, I lived in fear of those who were sent to murder me. But now I am at peace. I killed many would be assassins and it was while I was doing it that the truth was made clear to me. I live solely for myself. I love only myself. As it was the death of my mother that gave me life, so it is the death of others that sustains me. It makes me almost happy to be alive. And there's no end to it. As long as there are still people to kill in this great, wide, crowded world, I will never disappear!" His eyes widened alarmingly, face twisting into a grimace of pain. Talking time was apparently over.</p><p>"Now! Let me feel alive!"</p><p>Sand started to swirl around the room, rising into the air. He wasn't moving, wasn't using hand signs but the sand still moved. Ooooh, not good. I readied my chakra for a lightning jutsu, hoping that it would disperse the sand enough for us to retreat. Naruto wasn't moving, and Shikamaru didn't have much besides Shadow Possession, which obviously wasn't working.</p><p>"Alright! That's enough!" A wonderful, wonderful voice ordered. "Save it for the final competition. You're just wasting it today, is that what you want?"</p><p>Maito Gai stood in the doorway, his very presence diffusing the atmosphere of the room. The sand retreated, flowing back into the gourd. We dropped our Shadow Possession, confident in our backup.</p><p>Gaara clutched his head and groaned. His steps were shuffling and hesitant, awkward and off balance, but he paused by the door for one last comment.</p><p>"All the same, I will kill you. Just you wait. I'll kill you all."</p><p>We didn't even move as he left.</p><p>"Alright, kids?" Gai-sensei asked with a smile and a thumbs up.</p><p>I managed a shaky smile back. "Nice timing, Gai-sensei."</p><p>He laughed, slightly dramatically. "An ironic compliment from a student of my Eternal Rival! I cannot wait to see Kakashi's face when I inform him of this!"</p><p>We shuffled out of Lee's room, double and triple checking the corridors for Gaara's presence. He was gone.</p><p>"So…" I said, dragging the syllable out. "Chouji's room?"</p><p>Shikamaru blinked, then ran a shaky hand through his hair. "Sounds good to me."</p><p>Naruto didn't say a word as we retraced our steps, picking up the fruit basket that had been dropped and spilled it's contents across the corridor.</p><p>"How troublesome," Shikamaru sighed finally, as we settled into the chairs in Chouji's room.</p><p>"What's wrong, Shikamaru?" Chouji asked. "And why'd you have to bring that food back? It makes me so hungry."</p><p>I snapped a banana off the bunch and threw it to him. "We wont tell if you don't," I said.</p><p>He looked at it mournfully, probably wishing it was a pork rib or steak or something.</p><p>"We ran into Gaara," Shikamaru said. "Just now, in the hospital."</p><p>"Trying to kill Lee," I elaborated, because that was the important part.</p><p>Chouji froze. "You… you're not joking, are you?"</p><p>I shook my head. "It would have gotten messy if Gai-sensei hadn't shown up when he did."</p><p>We relayed what had happened to Chouji who listened in worry. Naruto was silent the whole time.</p><p>"Naruto? Are you okay?" Chouji asked. "You're kinda quiet over there."</p><p>Naruto stared down at his hands, clenching and unclenching them. "That guy…" he murmured. "He said… he had a demon inside of him."</p><p>"<em> Shukaku</em> ," I repeated. "The name of one of the Ten Tailed Beasts - the Bijuu. It's known as the Ichibi, the One-Tail and so regarded as the weakest of them all. It's known to be affiliated with the Sand Village, with two previous hosts including the monk Keshin Shukaku, which was probably who Gaara was talking about, and Bunbuku Chagama, who was most famous for the Massacre of Tsutanai Village during the Third Great Ninja War where he indiscriminately killed thirty enemy shinobi, the entire civilian village and three squads of Sand shinobi."</p><p>Shikamaru blinked and leaned backwards. "I forgot you used to love those stories," he muttered.</p><p>"The Bijuu are pretty interesting," I defended. "Did you know, there are stories that all nine of them used to be one being known as the Juubi - the Ten-Tailed - which the Sage of Sixth Paths then split into nine separate beings?"</p><p>And while most of the 'stories' about Bijuu were just that, I'd found out as much as I could because I knew they would one day be important. And given the way this world worked, I couldn't write off very much as 'fantasy' no matter how absurd. And well, a child fascinated with Bijuu myths is much less suspicious than a shinobi looking for information on Jinchuriki. My interest in history helped me put together a lot of different facts to get a clearer picture of the truth.</p><p>"Is… it common?" Naruto asked hesitantly. "To… have them sealed inside people."</p><p>I bit my lip and nodded. "Yeah. It's called 'Jinchuriki' meaning 'the power of human sacrifice'. I think all the Bijuu have been sealed at one point in time but most villages try and keep that information quiet. I think the only one I've never heard anything about is the Kyuubi but it must have, or it wouldn't have appeared so suddenly." Maybe because Konoha had never really used Kyuubi in battle the way other nations had.</p><p>Shikamaru's eyes had gone wide. "Naruto," he said carefully. "You said… 'I've got the real thing'…"</p><p>Naruto looked away. "Yeah," he muttered. "I did."</p><p>"That was the red chakra you used on the bridge," I said abruptly. "And in the forest."</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>"Man," Shikamaru drawled. "What a drag. That's gotta be rough."</p><p>"I kind of guessed," I admitted, feeling bad for putting Naruto on the spot like this. Particularly when I already knew the truth. "And we're not supposed to know about it, right?"</p><p>"Yeah," Naruto said, just glancing up at us quickly. "The Third Hokage made a rule, that no one was supposed to tell the kids about it…"</p><p>"Soo…" I dragged out, wanting to reassure Naruto but not really knowing how. "What's it's name? I mean, if the Ichibi is called Shukaku and the Yonbi is called Son Goku, then does the Kyuubi have a name?"</p><p>Naruto blinked. "Isn't 'Kyuubi' it's name?"</p><p>"Nah. Kyuubi means 'Nine Tails'. So it's more like a title, right? Or a description. Kinda like… Genin, or Jounin."</p><p>"Oh," he replied, stumped. "I don't know."</p><p>I shrugged. "Eh, never mind then. Want to play shogi?" Shikamaru was already setting up the shogi board again.</p><p>Naruto blinked and looked around the room at us. Shikamaru gave him a half hearted smile.</p><p>"Apple?" Chouji offered, holding out the fruit basket that was suspiciously half empty. He knew Chouji well enough to know that sharing food was sacred.</p><p>Naruto took one and if there were tears in his eyes, we didn't comment.</p><p>"Come on," I said, bumping shoulders with him. "You and me verses Shika and Chouji."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Third: Chapter 31</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - Naruto <em> was</em> doing well in his training… he just wasn't doing what Jiraiya wanted. Summoning toads was just a chakra intensive jutsu that was meant to drain Naruto until he was forced to call on the Kyuubi's power. Since he wasn't able to do that without the danger… off the cliff it was. Hmm. Jiraiya is a dick of a teacher.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 31</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> If you are far from the enemy, make him believe you are near. ~ Sun Tzu</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Ready?" I asked Shikamaru as we headed towards the stadium.</p><p>"If I say 'no' can we reschedule?" he joked.</p><p>"Probably not," I said. However odd it might have seemed to everyone else, I was more nervous than Shikamaru was. Oh, not about his fight but… given the way everything else had matched up I was pretty damn sure that there would be an invasion today.</p><p>I was wearing my standard mission gear, complete with kunai pouch and sealing scroll tucked into my jacket. I was as prepared as I was going to be. That didn't make it any less terrifying. Maybe I should have worked harder on finding a way to warn people.</p><p>The walk to the stadium was slow and quiet. The matches officially started at ten, which gave people most of the morning to arrive and get seated. And so, the streets were already buzzing with people and vendors.</p><p>I noticed that there were a lot of ninja out and about. More than I'd ever seen before. It wasn't obvious, but there was also a curious dearth of civilians. At first I thought they were just increased security for the Tournament, but then I realised - they were all combat ready. It was hard to tell just by looking at them, there isn't really any difference between a ninja on duty and off, but there was a tension in the air.</p><p>Then it dawned on me.</p><p>They knew the invasion was coming. They were planning to let it hit and break on the defences of the village. A statement of how useless trying to attack was. It was a trap. Most of the civilians had already been moved to the evacuation shelters. It was doubtful that the visiting shinobi would notice, since Konoha had the highest number of civilians in our hidden village. Mist had almost none.</p><p>The candidates for the Final Exam were supposed to meet up in the middle of the arena and I had tickets for the general Konoha populace section of the stands. We hung around the entrance for a while, not too eager to go in just yet. I perched on one of the stone fences, observing the people pouring into the entrance. There were a few ninja, but mostly civilians, merchants and nobles and allsorts dressed in fancy clothes.</p><p>Ino and Chouji arrived shortly after us.</p><p>"Oh, man," Ino said, staring at the stadium. "I'm so <em> nervous</em> ."</p><p>"You'll do fine," Chouji said, sounding like he'd been repeating the statement all morning.</p><p>"Of course I will. How could I not?" she tossed her hair. "But… Temari is pretty scary."</p><p>"Just do your best," I said quietly. "Other than that… don't get killed."</p><p>"You better believe it! I'm far too pretty to die," Ino said, tossing her hair. "Imagine how much of a <em> crime</em> that would be."</p><p>Shikamaru snorted and rolled his eyes, leaning back to stare at the sky. Ino whirled on him.</p><p>The three of them, Ino-Shika-Chou, they <em> meshed</em> . Even now, with the barest of words between them, I could see that Shika was far more settled, less nervous, than before. And Ino, for all her ranting, was much calmer.</p><p>They were a good team.</p><p>I caught sight of some familiar people and waved. Kiba and Hinata made their way over to us, shouldering their way through the crowd. Akamaru barked a greeting.</p><p>"Shino not here yet?" Kiba asked, eyes scanning around.</p><p>"He could be inside already," I offered. "We haven't been here that long."</p><p>"Oh," Hinata said quietly. "I wanted to wish him good luck."</p><p>I smiled at her. "How are you feeling, Hinata?" She'd only been out of the hospital for a week and even then they'd been a little doubtful about it.</p><p>"I'm okay," she said. "Really."</p><p>Kiba gave me a look that said he wasn't quite so certain about <em> that</em> . He looked very protective, hovering over her shoulder. I suppose if you were injured there are much worse people to rely on to look out for you than an Inuzuka team mate.</p><p>"Well, do you guys want to head upstairs? Hopefully we can find some seats together," I offered. It'd be nice to have someone to sit with, and then I could keep an eye on them.</p><p>"Sounds good to me," Kiba said, shrugging. "Whaddaya say, Hinata?"</p><p>"O-of course."</p><p>I stretched before jumping down to the ground. "Chouji?"</p><p>"Coming," he said, eating the last of his chips and tucking the empty packet away.</p><p>"I guess that's our cue to head inside," Ino said glancing nervously at the door.</p><p>"Good luck!" We chorused.</p><p>Unlike what I was used to when I thought of stadiums, the seating didn't go right around the arena. There were five or six pagoda sitting atop the wall on one side and <em> that</em> was where all the spectators were. One of the boxes was obviously reserved for the watching Kage, while the others were divided into status rankings. The very rich and important, the moderately rich and important, and the common folk and ninja that were scouting for upcoming talent. I suspected that several department heads would be about, even though fresh Chunin rarely got headhunted. This was, after all, one of the very few chances to actually observe ninja in action.</p><p>The four of us settled into seats that were, amusingly, beside two ninja that I recognised as proctors for the First and Second Exams - Izumo and Kotetsu. They were dressed in standard combat uniforms, not the grey Intelligence Division ones this time, but still.</p><p>"They look so small down there," Chouji commented. "And… where are Naruto and Sasuke?"</p><p>I bit my lip. "They'll get here soon." I was pretty sure, anyway. I couldn't see anything short of Orochimaru's return keeping Naruto away. Sasuke… well, he was with Sensei.</p><p>Sure enough, Naruto appeared shortly before the proctor called them to attention. Sasuke… didn't.</p><p>"Still not here," Kiba muttered, frowning.</p><p>"Sensei is <em> always</em> late," I said. "but I'm pretty sure he wouldn't make Sasuke miss his fight."</p><p>"Welcome all!" The Hokage's voice echoed around the stands. "And our deepest thanks for coming here to the Village Hidden in the Leaves for our Chunin Selection Exams."</p><p>There was definitely some kind of technique involved here, since I couldn't see any speakers and there wasn't that mechanical tinny quality to it. And there was no way that his voice was carrying this distance naturally.</p><p>He gave a bit of a welcome speech, but it wasn't that bad considering how long he'd dragged on for in the prelims. I guess he knew that everyone had come to see the fighting.</p><p>"Alright," Hayate coughed. "The terrain is different but the rules are the same. Naruto Uzumaki and Neji Hyuuga have the first match. Those two stay and the rest of you can go to the waiting area."</p><p>It was clear that he was talking to the candidates, but his voice carried up to us in the stands as well. Either the stadium had excellent acoustics, or there was some kind of amplification jutsu down there. It made sense, after all, this was being used to judge them - their skills <em> and</em> their characters.</p><p>"You got anything to say to me?" Neji asked, down below.</p><p>"Only what I told you the last time," Naruto growled out. "I'm going to win this."</p><p>"So much the better for me," Neji retorted, smirking. "I can't wait to see the look of despair on your face when you learn that your foolish vow is impossible to keep."</p><p>"Are we just going to stand here talking all day?" Wind whirled around Naruto, stirred up by the agitation of his chakra. It even reached us in the stands.</p><p>"Let the first match, begin!"</p><p>Beside us, the two Chunin were looking on in interest. "Who would have thought that that little squirt could have survived this long?" Kotetsu mused.</p><p>"Yeah," Izumo agreed, leaning forward on his elbows. "He's been one lucky kid so far. But his lucks about to run out. He'll never survive this one."</p><p>"Yeah, it's going to be painful. Going up against one of the Hyuuga Clan? He doesn't stand a chance."</p><p>Hinata made a distressed sound at their observations. Admittedly, yeah, from an outsiders point of view, Naruto vs. Neji was a match up that would only end one way.</p><p>"Don't fuss, Hinata," I murmured. "Naruto is too stubborn to give up. He'll be fine."</p><p>"You got <em> that</em> right," Kiba agreed. "I underestimated him and look what happened to me." Akamaru flattened his ears and whined.</p><p>"You think he'll win?" Chouji asked curiously.</p><p>I nodded slowly. "Yeah. It's <em> important</em> to him to win, because of Neji's actions. He'll keep going long past where any reasonable person might have given up. And besides… it's not like he hasn't done any planning for this."</p><p>For one, I'd made sure he'd memorised my info sheet. For another, I'd walked him through several imaginary encounters with Neji, supplying the enemy action if he couldn't. Naruto had been mostly bored, but a little fascinated by it. But damn, I wasn't going to let him in there without a plan.</p><p>We watched in anticipation.</p><p>He launched a wave of kunai towards Neji, who deflected them easily, sending them scattering across the ground, one burying itself in a tree. To my chakra sense, they burned bright with chakra - clones - but did nothing. Setting a trap early, or showing Neji that your 'special' kunai are harmless?</p><p>Then he charged forward, laying on a brutal taijutsu assault.</p><p><em> What?</em></p><p>Naruto's taijutsu was better, but not in league with Neji's. And he <em> knew</em> that he couldn't afford to get hit with the Gentle Fist.</p><p>"You idiot!" Kiba shouted, aggrieved. "A frontal attack will <em> never</em> work!"</p><p>"Close combat like that is lethal. Unless…" My eyes widened. "Those kunai…"</p><p>He was only supposed to use clones to attack like that because risking his chakra system was stupid. So what if… that <em> was</em> a clone. If the 'real' Naruto was one of the kunai… It would have taken a supremely fast Transformation, Replacement <em> and</em> Shadow Clone Jutsu to pull off…</p><p>"That's so crazy it's brilliant," I breathed. It must have killed him to take a safe spot and stay out of the fight itself. But oh, if he pulled it off…</p><p>"What?" Kiba demanded. "What's he done?"</p><p>I giggled with glee. "Just watch. You probably wont see it for a while, but watch."</p><p>Neji wasn't even really using Jyuuken down there, otherwise the bout would have been over much faster. He was underestimating Naruto.</p><p>Naruto dived backwards out of the way of the strike that would have ended his ability to fight, and rolled back to his feet.</p><p>"Do you understand now?" Neji demanded. "You have no way of beating me."</p><p>"Get real!" Naruto scoffed, hands forming that familiar seal. "I was just testing you, that's all. Okay, now that we're warmed up, lets get started." The air around him shimmered, and suddenly there was even more orange down there.</p><p>"Well, isn't he something," Kotetsu said in mild surprise.</p><p>"That Shadow Clone Jutsu is a Jounin level technique," Izumo added. "Where'd that kid pick up a technique like that?"</p><p>"This match could be more interesting than we thought." I could have sworn he glanced over at us out the corner of his eye but it was too quick to catch it.</p><p>"Those are the clones he used against me, right?" Kiba said. "Is that <em> really</em> a Jounin level technique?"</p><p>"Mmhmm," I hummed. "It takes a lot of chakra. Sensei pretty much forbid him from teaching it to us because of that."</p><p>"Huh. Our little dead last has come a long way," Kiba said, grinning wildly, cheering as the clones mobbed around Neji, who was starting to look a little <em> pressed</em> . One Naruto he could handle, but ten coordinated attacks was getting a little much. The Byakugan meant he could see them, but reacting in time was still an issue.</p><p>"Eight Trigrams: Heavenly Rotation!"</p><p>Wow. The Kaiten was <em> impressive.</em></p><p>"But that was…" Hinata said, shocked. "Only Main Branch…"</p><p>"A move like that," I commented, offhand. "Has got to be pretty chakra intensive."</p><p>Hinata blinked. "I- yes. It is."</p><p>"So how many times do you reckon Neji can pull it off? Five? Six?" I wouldn't think he could use it that many times, particularly not if he wanted to have chakra left over to fight.</p><p>"And how many times can Naruto force him to use it?" Kiba asked, catching on.</p><p>I smirked. "Oh, I'd say quite a few."</p><p>"Did you really think you'd won?" Neji asked coldly, as he stopped spinning. The defence/attack had shredded a fair few of the clones. "Your persistence is ridiculous."</p><p>"You don't know what you're talking about," Naruto retorted.</p><p>"It is <em> you</em> who doesn't see your own limitations. People are set, fixed, unchangeable. Only a fool wastes time trying to become something he can never be. You thought you could be Hokage? It's absurd."</p><p>"A fool?" Naruto scoffed in disgust. "Here we go again. Who are you to judge what a person can or cannot be?"</p><p>"You think anyone can become Hokage? That all it takes is a little <em> hard work?</em> Of all the shinobi in all the world, think of how few ever become Hokage. They were born destined to be Hokage. It's not something you become merely by <em> trying</em> to become. They were chosen by destiny. Each person is given his own path to follow. And he must follow it. <em> Obediently.</em> " He spat the word out, spitefully. "There is only one destiny we all share equally. Death."</p><p>"Yeah, so what? You can think that way if you want. People always tell me I just don't know when to give up." He smirked and pulled out a kunai.</p><p>Four of the Naruto's jumped, one from each direction, throwing their kunai towards Neji. The downward angle meant that if they missed, the knives would just hit the dirt, not other clones. I suspected I knew what was coming next.</p><p>Neji sneered and pulled his kunai to deflect them.</p><p>"Now!" Naruto shouted, just as Neji reached out to swipe the first away.</p><p>Four kunai blossomed into a rain of metal.</p><p>Of course the clones could do it too, I thought. They're already clones, and so are their kunai.</p><p>It has to be said that Neji has very good reactions. He spun into another Kaiten, almost immediately, but when the smoke cleared it was easy to see it hadn't been quite fast enough. He hadn't been prepared for the mass replication. There was blood leaking from a cut on his cheek, slices in his clothing and red blooming on the bandages around one arm.</p><p>He looked very wary.</p><p>"Hot damn," Kiba breathed.</p><p>"If only you knew," I muttered, eyeing the metal scattered across the ground. Not all of them had been dispersed by the Kaiten.</p><p>The Naruto's smirked and prepared another barrage. Neji spun another Kaiten to deflect the metal, but he knew he was in a bad spot. Naruto's clones were surrounding him, and when the Kaiten died down he didn't hold his position. He raced for the clone that had been speaking, to attack, and to get out of the circle of death.</p><p>"Shadow Clone Jutsu!" Naruto cried, creating even more clones. Neji fought some and ducked, dodged, weaved and jumped past the others. He was intent on striking the leader and ending the fight.</p><p>"You're the one hanging back for fear of my striking your chakra points," Neji deduced. "The more the others attack, the more you stand out for holding back. You're the real one, aren't you? This is the end for you. You're in my range, and you can't escape. Eight Trigrams: Sixty Four Palms."</p><p>"The match is over," Kotetsu said from beside us.</p><p>"Not yet," I murmured, eyes fixed on the match.</p><p>"I have now struck all Sixty Four of your chakra points," Neji said, breathing hard. "You're lucky to still be breathing. Well, it must be frustrating. To realise how utterly hopeless it all was. This little dream of yours. You thought you could succeed through hard work alone. That's only an illusion."</p><p>"You're the one who sees an illusion." Naruto coughed, then exploded into smoke.</p><p>Hinata started coughing.</p><p>"Hey, Hinata, what's wrong? Are you okay?" Kiba asked concerned.</p><p>I turned to look at her. "You're coughing blood!" I said, alarmed, hands darting through the seals for my diagnostic jutsu. I crouched in front of her, squeezing into the narrow space between the rows of seats.</p><p>The others around us made noises of alarm and worry.</p><p>Her heart beat was fast and it was stressing the weakened tissue. When Neji had hit her heart tenketsu, it had damaged the muscle, which in turn had caused problems with her pulse and blood pressure. The high pressure had damaged the delicate capillaries in the alveolar tissue of her lungs, which was causing the blood in her lungs.</p><p>"This is beyond my skills," I said. "We need to get you back to the hospital."</p><p>Hinata shook her head weakly, but couldn't speak over her coughing. I could guess that she wanted to stay and watch the fight.</p><p>"Here let me have a look at her," a friendly sounding voice said. I glanced up, only to come face to face with an ANBU mask. "Don't worry, you can trust me."</p><p><em> Metallic, like the gleam of light off a knife, like the sharp taste of blood, honed and sharp and lethal.</em></p><p>I swallowed.</p><p><em> Kabuto.</em></p><p>"I'm a medic," he said.</p><p>He <em> was</em> a medic. A damned good one. Kiba and Chouji were already moving so we could get Hinata out of the seats. He didn't have any reason to help Hinata, though, and I didn't exactly trust him.</p><p>But what could I say? Sorry no?</p><p><em> Shit.</em> There was no one around I could trust to believe me if I told them this was Kabuto. If Sensei was here…</p><p>He carried Hinata up to the back of the stands, lying her flat on the floor and summoning his chakra. The green glow was extremely steady and fine tuned, a flat, monochrome green.</p><p>With half an ear, I could hear Naruto and Neji talking. About Hinata, about the Hyuuga Clan… I filed it away, but didn't pay much attention.</p><p>"Hinata's looking more lively now," Kiba said in relief. "These ANBU guys are good."</p><p>"She's okay now. She just needs to rest," Kabuto said.</p><p>I slid my chakra into her system. "Oh. Wow. You … healed her completely. That's amazing." It was. Lung tissue… heart tissue… it was extremely delicate. There was a reason that the Hospital hadn't been able to fully heal her. There wasn't any doubt that Kabuto was an excellent medic - he was just a depraved one.</p><p>I only hoped he hadn't done anything else.</p><p>Kabuto's motivations were impossible to determine. And that made him even <em> more</em> dangerous.</p><p>"You should go back to watching the match. It's quite interesting, isn't it?" Kabuto said.</p><p>"<em> Interesting</em> practically defines Naruto," I muttered. "Along with <em> unpredictable."</em></p><p>"Thanks for helping, ANBU-san," Chouji said politely as Kiba scooped Hinata up into his arms. We couldn't leave her back here, someone might stand on her.</p><p>"People are born carrying an unchangeable fate. To carry a seal that can never be removed, a guy like you could never understand," Neji was saying.</p><p>I shared a glance with Chouji, the only other one who knew here.</p><p>"No, I understand," Naruto said lowly, then glared fiercely at Neji. "So what about it?"</p><p>That was… such a Naruto reaction. Life sucks, <em> so what?</em></p><p>"You're not the only special person here," Naruto continued. "Hinata was suffering, just like you. She was from the Main Family, but she tried her best to change herself because no one would acknowledge her. That's the determination she had and she fought you even after she was injured. The Branch Family is supposed to protect the Main Family, yet you did that to Hinata and it was only an Exam. You were trying hard to fight against Fate, weren't you?" The insight came out of left field, which was usually where Naruto's insight hid. He was <em> good</em> at understanding people.</p><p>"Why do you fight against your fate so hard?" Neji asked, sounding almost despairing.</p><p>"Because… you called me a failure," Naruto said.</p><p>We slipped back into our seats. There was a single Naruto standing, talking to Neji who looked tired. But the kunai were still scattered over the arena, so Naruto wasn't done yet.</p><p>"After I become Hokage," Naruto said, forming a cross seal. "I'll change the Hyuuga for you."</p><p>Neji settled back into a Jyuuken stance. "Then show me if what you say is true."</p><p>Neji was slower now, in both dodging the clones and attacking. He was trying not to have to rely on Kaiten, I could see, aware that he didn't have much chakra left.</p><p><em> You turned it into a battle of attrition, huh?</em></p><p>"Lightning Release: Striking Bolt!" Four Naruto's cried.</p><p>Lightning lanced. Blue chakra bloomed into a Kaiten.</p><p>Neji sunk to one knee, panting heavily, before staggering back to his feet. "Still not enough," he said and darted forward, out of the crater made by his Kaiten.</p><p>His hand struck fast, slamming into Naruto's chest.</p><p>"Again…" Naruto spoke, blood dripping from his mouth. "You assume… I'm the real one."</p><p>Neji's eyes widened. Naruto exploded into a puff of smoke.</p><p>And then, the dozens of kunai scattered about his feet turned back into clones. The nearest ones grabbed onto his legs. Some grabbed his arms. Around his waist. Pinning him, holding him immobile.</p><p>And, then, one cold cocked him in the jaw. Messy and brutal and unavoidable.</p><p>Neji slumped, unconscious.</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>"Winner," Hayate coughed. "Naruto Uzumaki."</p><p>We exploded into cheers, Akamaru howling along.</p><p>"Alright!" Kiba cheered. "Way to go Naruto!"</p><p>"Never saw <em> that</em> coming," Kotetsu said, shaking his head. "Unbelievable."</p><p>Medics came onto the field and carted Neji off on a stretcher, and then the Naruto clones dispersed. All of them.</p><p>"Wait, what?" Chouji said.</p><p>Then there was a puff of smoke, and Naruto appeared standing beside one of the trees encircling the arena.</p><p>"You mean…" Izumo said, leaning forward. "Right from the start…"</p><p>"Neji never even <em> spoke to</em> the real Naruto," I said smugly. "Let alone hit him. They were <em> all</em> clones."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Oh and if anyone is wondering about Hayate... it went something like this in canon: Dosu challenged Gaara on top of Kikyo castle, Gaara transformed/went nuts and killed him. Baki and Kabuto were watching and discussing their plans. Hayate overheard them then died. That leads me to assume they were all drawn there by Gaara.</p><p>Thus, no Dosu, no fight. Nothing to draw Hayate to that location. There's also comparatively increased security, particuarly on lookout for Kabuto and Orochimaru due to extra suspicions and things. Make sense?</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Third: Chapter 32</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Y'know, watching the Temari vs. Shika match… he's actually fast. He did dodge her opening moves so fast no one actually saw him move. … And made it look easy.</p><p>Also, sorry if the Shino/Shika fight isn't as epic as everyone imagined. Those two are <em> hard</em> to write fights for.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 32</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> All war is based on deception. ~ Sun Tzu</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>There was a long pause between matches as the proctors tried to decide what to do next. By rights, Sasuke wasn't here and should be disqualified.</p><p>I propped my chin in my hand and stared down at the arena.</p><p>"Just what <em> is</em> Sasuke playing at?" Kiba asked gruffly.</p><p>I shrugged. "Ain't that the question of the century?" Even as I spoke, I felt a whisper of familiar chakra brush against my senses. With so many people here, I would have ignored it… except I knew my team mates.</p><p>My head snapped around and I stared at the back wall of the box. There was nothing to see, yet I could still <em> swear…</em></p><p><em> Are you already here, Sensei?</em></p><p>My brow furrowed. Was Sensei being <em> deliberately</em> late? Well… more deliberately than normal. As in 'standing about watching for the moment to make an entrance'?</p><p><em> What would be the point?</em></p><p>Was he hoping that Sasuke would get disqualified and not have to fight Gaara? I couldn't see Sasuke agreeing to that. Wait, hadn't Gaara been some kind of signal or something?</p><p>Extending the fights worked in Konoha's benefit because it was actually a legitimate Chunin Exams. There were watching dignitaries in the stands. The more they saw before the invasion, the better our reputation would be. And Genin were not supposed to be frontline fighters in situations like this, so them exhausting themselves fighting was no biggy.</p><p>Though in the eyes of the dignitaries, the invasion could go two ways. If we held it off well, without extreme damage it would be all 'very good, old chap, I knew you were strong' but if we failed at that it would be 'well, I hear the Village Hidden in the Clouds is quite strong'. It would either cement our reputation or break it.</p><p>Down in the arena Hayate coughed before his voice carried up to us. "One of the competitors for the next battle has not arrived yet so we're going to postpone this match and continue with the next fight."</p><p>There was a little bit of jeering in the stands behind me. I wondered if they were selling alcoholic refreshments here. Then again, people could be juvenile idiots without the aid of alcohol.</p><p>"That's interesting," Kotetsu said offhandedly.</p><p>"They don't usually make an exception like that," Izumo agreed.</p><p>Temari created a blast of wind with her fan and used it to glide down into the arena. Already, she was a hit with the crowd. It had been obvious, even back in the prelims that Temari was a bit of a showman. Right now, it was working in her favour. Ino was pretty, and charismatic when she tried, but she wasn't flashy.</p><p>Then again, the point wasn't to win the crowd over.</p><p>"Match two; Ino Yamanaka verses Temari," Hayate announced. "Begin."</p><p>There was a tense silence as the two regarded each other for a long moment. Ino was the first one to spring into action, pulling out two handfuls of kunai and flinging them at Temari before back flipping out of the way to get some distance.</p><p>The kunai flew true, but Temari's shifting wind currents scattered them to the ground at her feet. She scoffed. "Don't you Leaf ninja ever lea-"</p><p>The explosion caught her off guard.</p><p>See, most of the time, when you attached explosive tags to kunai they trailed from the hilt like tails. That was simply because they were easiest to attach like that; you could do it in the heat of combat pretty easily. But, if you knew that you were going to be using explosive notes, it was just as easy to wrap them around the grip.</p><p>That had the bonus of not being easily visually identifiable.</p><p>The smoke cleared to reveal Temari crouched down behind her opened fan, having used it to protect herself from the worst of the blast. She was still a little scorched, though, and <em> completely</em> pissed off.</p><p>"Wind Release: Sickle Weasel Jutsu!" She grasped the Tessen by it's huge iron base and heaved, body bending nearly double as she swung the huge open fan through it's full arc.</p><p>Ino did the sensible thing and went for cover. Dust blew, wind howled and slash marks appeared on all the trees. The gust was strong up here, I could only imagine what it was like for Ino.</p><p>"Is <em> this</em> all a kunoichi of the Leaf village is worth?" Temari sneered, trying to regain the mental upper hand of combat. "Running and hiding, <em> girlie?</em> "</p><p>"You know," Ino said, stepping out from behind the tree. She looked a little battered, but not overly so. "I did wonder how those wind currents of yours would handle explosive notes. I guess the answer is 'not well', huh?"</p><p>"Ooh, bitch fight," Kiba winced. "This is not going to be pretty."</p><p>I could only <em> imagine</em> what look was on Temari's face at that comment, but I agreed with him.</p><p>Ino hurled a second barrage of projectiles across the arena.</p><p>"I admit, you caught me off guard with those explosive notes, but don't expect the same trick to work twice!" Temari shouted, batting them away with a powerful heave of her fan, and sending the kunai reeling all over the arena. But the way that the light caught, for just a second, on nothing made me realise Ino's tactic.</p><p>"Clever," I said approvingly. "Ino knew she'd be expecting exploding tags, so the second batch had ninja wire attached."</p><p>"Same trick Naruto pulled on me, huh?" Kiba queried.</p><p>"Maybe. Not sure it'll work the same. The arena is bigger, for one, she has less wire and not all of the kunai are anchored… but I'm guessing Ino's game plan is basically - avoid the wind, trap her and then use Mind-Body Switch to make her forfeit…" As far as plans went, it wasn't bad. But, as they say, the Devil is in the details.</p><p>Temari kept blasting her Sickle Weasel Jutsu around, forcing Ino to dart in and out of hiding. But Ino wasn't running scared, she was moving with purpose, so I wasn't worried yet. Temari's attacks were throwing up a whole heap of dust, and effectively obscuring sight. But Ino was a sensor type so it probably wasn't as limiting for her as everyone expected. I could tell she was being very busy down there, but not at <em> what</em> .</p><p>"Come on! You run out of spirit already?" Temari taunted. "I'm just getting warmed up here! It'd be an awful shame to have to quit just yet!"</p><p>"You want spirit?" Ino yelled. "Then take this!" She hurled a … capsule? I couldn't quite see from up here. It arced up high, as though to come down on Temari from above.</p><p>Temari responded exactly the same way she had been so far, blasting it with wind. The capsule shattered, spilling a colourful gas into the air above her.</p><p>"Poison?" I guessed. The Yamanaka did produce a lot of plant based poisons, so it wasn't an extreme guess. When fighting by themselves, the slow speed of the Mind-Body Switch Jutsu meant that slowing down and stopping their opponent was modus operendi. Poison, traps, these weren't the basis for their fighting style, but they were used to assist in capturing an opponent.</p><p>"Hah!" Temari shouted, clearing the air with a wide sweep of her fan. "My team mate is a puppet master, you think I haven't built up an immunity by now?"</p><p>It wasn't quite the truth. Even from here I could tell that she was slightly slower (which meant Ino must have been using a damn fast acting poison) but it wasn't enough. Every village (if not <em> individual ninja)</em> used their own poisons, and guarded the secrets to those recipes. Immunity to one branch didn't automatically mean immunity to another.</p><p>But it gave her experience with dealing with poisons, that much was clear with how quickly she got out of the way and swept the entire area clear.</p><p>"Nice try, little girl," Temari taunted, propping her fan up and leaning on it, just a little. "But you should go back to playing dress up with your dollies."</p><p>"That's it!" Ino shouted, jumping out from behind the tree she'd been sheltering behind. "I have had <em> enough</em> of your lame taunts, you walking fashion disaster!"</p><p>"Aww, Ino," Chouji groaned. "And you were doing so well, too."</p><p>On my other side, Kotetsu leant back in his chair. "Match is over. Shame she lost her head like that."</p><p>I squinted down at the arena. "Ino's faking." Just <em> what</em> she was doing, I couldn't tell, but the rant was a distraction.</p><p>Kiba winced as she hit a particularly shrill note. "Well, I wish she'd hurry up. I think my ears are bleeding." Akamaru whimpered in agreement.</p><p>"- and I'll show you!" Ino shouted, hands forming the triangular seal of the Yamanaka Jutsu.</p><p>"What?" Chouji gasped. "Ino, you can't-!"</p><p>Temari obviously didn't know what the seal did, but she didn't look like she wanted to find out. She grasped her fan and heaved… and it didn't budge.</p><p>There were gasps of shock from around us.</p><p>"The ninja wire!" I blurted out. Ino had left ninja wire crisscrossing the arena floor in various patterns, not intending to trap Temari with it like Naruto had Kiba but to channel her chakra through it. She was standing on one strand, and had channelled chakra through the weave until it reached Temari. One strand was wrapped around the fan, another around Temari's legs.</p><p>"Mind-Body Swi-"</p><p>"Wind Release: Gale Palm Jutsu!" Temari thrust her palm forward like a strike, chakra blasting from it. It slammed into Ino hard, lifting her off her feet and smashing into the wall. She slumped down it.</p><p>Temari panted in the sudden silence. Clearly, using wind jutsu without her fan was more difficult and draining for her.</p><p>Hayate coughed and approached. Ino didn't stir.</p><p>"Ino Yamanaka is unconscious and unable to continue," he announced. "The winner is Temari."</p><p>Cheers exploded around us, but I sank back with a groan. "You were <em> so</em> close, Ino."</p><p>"That bites," Chouji said. "She's going to be impossible to deal with now." He looked mournfully at his empty chip packet before taking out another one.</p><p>"I have to admit," Kiba said slowly. "I didn't actually expect her to do that well."</p><p>"Solo combat definitely isn't her speciality," I agreed. "But she's been working damn hard this last month."</p><p>We watched as the medics carried Ino out of the arena. She might have lost but it hadn't gone as badly as it might have. She wasn't walking out of the arena… but she wasn't grievously injured, either.</p><p>"So next up …" Kiba trailed off, glancing at us.</p><p>"Yup," I confirmed. "Shika and Shino."</p><p>"Heh. Shino's got this won," Kiba boasted.</p><p>I scoffed. "Dream on. Shikamaru's obviously going to win." Okay, not 'obviously' but being overconfident in his victory was my duty as a sister.</p><p>"That slacker?" Kiba laughed. "He scored even worse than me at the Academy."</p><p>"Shikamaru knows exactly how much effort he can get away with not putting into something," I retorted. Because he <em> had</em> graduated, however barely.</p><p>"That doesn't even make sense!" Kiba said.</p><p>"Yeah, well," I floundered for a retort. "Your face!" Oh, god. I hadn't said that, had I?</p><p>His jaw dropped open. "That's… you… Akamaru! Sic her!"</p><p>Akamaru yipped and jumped off Kiba's shoulder at me. He growled fiercely and then proceeded to slobber all over my face. I caught his tiny body gently and tried to hold him at arms length. "Chouji, help me! I'm getting mauled!"</p><p>Chouji was laughing and being utterly unhelpful, so I proceeded to twitch over sideways and 'die' dramatically over everyone's laps.</p><p>"We'll be merciful if you admit to our greatness," Kiba declared, between fits of laughter. "Bow down to the might of the Inuzuka Duo."</p><p>"Never!" I yelped, taking a different tactic and scratching Akamaru behind the ears. He seemed torn for a second, between continuing his 'attack' and submitting before bunting his head into my fingers.</p><p>"Traitor!" Kiba accused him, but he clearly wasn't serious, considering that he was still laughing.</p><p>"Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a Nara," I said, before scrunching my nose up and trying to wipe my face clean with my sleeve. Dog slobber, lovely.</p><p>"Shino Aburame verses Shikamaru Nara," Hayate announced. "Begin."</p><p>I scrambled back upright, careful not to spill Akamaru on the floor, in order to watch the fight.</p><p>Shino placed himself on the west side, so that the sun was sinking behind him. Meaning, all the shadows created by the wall were also behind him. It was an interesting choice. On one hand, it separated Shikamaru from what could easily be a huge advantage. On the other hand, it put a huge mass of shadow behind him.</p><p>It could go either way.</p><p>"It would be intelligent for you to forfeit this match," Shino announced. "Why? Because your shadow jutsu is not a good match against my clan techniques."</p><p>Shikamaru sighed. "This whole thing is so troublesome. But having to do it all over again… that would be even worse. It really doesn't make a whole lot of difference to me if I ever become Chunin or not… but, eh, there are other people counting on me, so I guess I better give it a shot."</p><p>"Well, he sounds enthusiastic," Izumo said sarcastically.</p><p>Kiba snorted.</p><p>Surprisingly, after his declaration of non-interest, it was Shikamaru that started the combat. He folded his fingers together into the rat seal and sent his shadow straight out towards Shino. Our shadow jutsu were fast, but not that fast. If you saw it coming, you could dodge.</p><p>Which was just what Shino did, jumping backwards until he'd exceeded the reach of Shikamaru's shadow. If he wanted to go any further, Shika would have to find another shadow to piggyback.</p><p>Shino's Kikai swarmed out of his sleeves, coating his arms and hanging in the air around him. He was probably dispersing them, too; secretly preparing for a sneak attack. It seemed like the clever thing to do.</p><p>Actually, come to think of it… "Shino probably had him bugged before he even set foot in the arena," I thought out loud.</p><p>"Yeah, probably," Kiba agreed. "He's sneaky like that. Not that there's anywhere to hide down there."</p><p>Bugs swarmed across the arena in loops and arcs, the numbers so heavy that the masses looked almost solid. Shikamaru proved that Mum's early morning training had helped as he dived and dodged and avoided them. Of course, the bugs would just regroup and attack again, and he couldn't keep dodging forever. He tripped, rolled, and they all dove in for the kill, a thick black blanket that would drain him of chakra in seconds.</p><p>Shikamaru reached into his weapons pouch and pulled out a kunai with fluttering explosive note attached. He slammed in into the ground next to him, the explosion knocking the bugs back.</p><p>"The hell-?" Kiba wondered. "He just … exploded himself?"</p><p>I snorted. "Shika is slow and lazy by choice not because of any lack of speed," I said. That was a mistaken belief a lot of people had. When sufficiently motivated, he could move damn fast, as shown by the lack of crispy Shikamaru as the smoke cleared.</p><p>The explosion had certainly damaged a number of Shino's Kikai, leaving burnt insect husks littering the ground. Not all of them, though, and he certainly hadn't committed everything to that one attack.</p><p>"Hiding is futile," Shino said impassively, forcing Shikamaru out of the foliage by way of another attack.</p><p>Shikamaru tossed a wave of kunai at him, which were contemptuously batted aside, and darted forward, only to be forced back by another wave of Kikai. The two attacks nearly caught him in a pincer move, but he evaded.</p><p>"It looks like Shino really has him on the run," Kiba commented, a little gleefully.</p><p>I shared a glance with Chouji, who had just as much faith in Shikamaru as I did. "I think… he's positioning," I said slowly. "Though I don't know exactly what his plan is."</p><p>"I trust Shikamaru to know what he's doing," Chouji said easily.</p><p>The two appeared to be stalemated, Shika avoiding Shino's attacks and making attempts forward while Shino maintained a careful distance between the two and trying to prevent Shikamaru from elongating his shadow. They jockeyed back and forth a little, gaining and losing ground. Admittedly, it was more energetic than I had thought Shikamaru's match would be.</p><p>There were bugs creeping around the walls and swarming over the ground, reducing the amount of ground that was safe to move on. I considered the number of bugs there had to be down there and how many I had estimated Shino to have.</p><p>"Shino's overcommitted," I said. "Game over."</p><p>"What?" Kiba jerked up and stared at me incredulously. "Shino's <em> winning!</em> "</p><p>Shikamaru rolled to a crouch in one of the craters left behind from Neji's Kaiten. From this angle, I could barely see the scroll that he spread out on the bottom of the ditch and I could bet that Shino didn't see it at all.</p><p>"There are no paths of escape left," Shino said as his bugs closed in on my brother. "You should surrender before my Kikai suck you dry."</p><p>"Just try it," Shikamaru challenged.</p><p>The Kikai descended on him. Shino might have half been expecting another exploding noted, because the bugs were staggered in waves, making a very thick wall of them instead of all swarming at once.</p><p>Nothing…</p><p>Nothing…</p><p>Then…</p><p><em> Wssshsssnk!</em></p><p>It was kinda hard to describe the sound. It was a mix between an explosion and a huge wave slamming down on the ground. A huge surge of water burst out of the scroll and <em> flattened </em> the surrounding area.</p><p>When I'd made those water scrolls, I'd had Gaara's transformed state in mind. Therefore… I'd included a lot of water. Around a hundred thousand litres, which was approximately the amount of water in a small swimming pool. I'd had to go out of Konoha to find a lake big enough to make five scrolls without depreciating it too much.</p><p>That said, the water fountained into the air, sweeping Shino's bugs aside. It didn't fill up the arena, or anything dramatic like that, but the craters were now pools and the ground was nice and soggy.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," Shikamaru said with a sigh, unfolding out of the water. I was impressed he hadn't been swept away.</p><p>Shino blinked. "As the sun sinks, my shadow elongates," he surmised. "Meaning that my calculation of the distance you would need to cover was incorrect. Clever. However…"</p><p>"Unfortunately for you, what you have snared is my Insect Clone," Shino's voice stated impassively from the other side of the arena.</p><p>There were gasps from the stands as people hadn't noticed switch. Although, Shino had been hiding until that sentence.</p><p>Shikamaru smirked lazily. "You sure about that?" he asked, raising his hands. <em> Both</em> Shinos mirrored him.</p><p>If it were possible to radiate surprise without moving a facial muscle, Shino did it. "How…" he trailed off. "I made certain that you did not connect your shadow to mine."</p><p>"Well, I'll have to thank Ino for leaving so much ninja wire lying about," Shika said, gesturing to one of the kunai lodged into the wall, a sliver of shiny silver trailing across the arena, where it ended by his feet. Even wire would cast a shadow, however faint. "Look over your shoulder, I'll let you." He twisted his neck so Shino could see the shadow extending from the wall behind him.</p><p>"I see," Shino said. "You used the ninja wire to get your shadow to the wall, then circled around until it was behind me. While I attempted to keep you away from it… that was exactly where you wanted me to be."</p><p>"Yeah," Shikamaru agreed, lazily.</p><p>"While I believed I was in control of the match… you were luring me into your own traps, to reduce the number of my Kikai that were free to move," Shino continued. "Believing I was winning, I committed too many of my insects to the field and you wiped them out."</p><p>I think he was stalling. The Insect Clone was shifting, <em> rustling,</em> and I didn't know if Shikamaru could make it hold together for long. If it dissolved back into free moving bugs there might be a problem.</p><p>"While I'd love to forfeit now and claim I can't go any further," Shikamaru said with a yawn. "That would be a lie." His hand reached into his kunai pouch and withdrew four kunai, paper tags trailing visibly from the hilt. Shino mirrored him. "Mine have exploding tags, yours don't. I'm going to throw these to box you in, one meter square, if you don't surrender by the count of three. One… two…"</p><p>Four exploding tags in such a close radius would do a whole heap of damage, particularly since Shino wouldn't be able to negate it in any way what so ever.</p><p>Shino nodded. "I surrender," he said calmly. "You have caused a substantial amount of damage to my colony and I am currently unable to move. My options are limited. I withdraw from this match."</p><p>There was a beat of silence.</p><p>Hayate coughed. "Winner by forfeit: Shikamaru Nara."</p><p>The applause was thunderous.</p><p>"Huh," Chouji said. "I'm surprised that Shikamaru <em> didn't</em> give up."</p><p>"I'm glad he didn't," I said, petting Akamaru absently. "Because that would have made me lose an argument with <em> Kiba</em> and that would just be embarrassing."</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p><hr /></p><p>One hundred thousand litres sounds like a heck of a lot of water, but that's a pool 10x10x1 metres. 100 cubic metres, 100,000 litres. Since, apparently, most school pools are like 50x25x2 metres… but big numbers are intimidating…</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Third: Chapter 33</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: A few people commented that they were surprised that Shika didn't forfeit… I like to think that Shikamaru forfeited against Temari because it was such an obvious and clear-cut win. Against Shino, he needed the verbal confirmation of surrender. Well, that and his sister would have been mad at him.</p><p>And Nemesis Jedi - Shikako loaded <em> everyone</em> down with enough explosives to level the stadium. XD</p><p>Ah, Chidori. One of the strongest and strangest techniques in this show. Personally, I think the English translation of 'assassination jutsu' is a little… erroneous. Don't quote me on this, but I think the actual Japanese translates better as 'one hit kill'. I mean, you end up dead either way, but assassination implies a level of <em> sneakiness</em> that doesn't really… well. Loud chirping. Bright lights. I can see why it got translated like that but still.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 33</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> All men are brothers, like the seas throughout the world; So why do winds and waves clash so fiercely everywhere? ~ Emperor Hirohito</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The match between the winner - Shikamaru - and Kankurou was supposed to be next, but said Sand shinobi forfeited with some bogus claim of knowing he couldn't win.</p><p>"What the hell?" Chouji asked, summing up the feelings of most of the crowd.</p><p>"You don't come to the Chunin Exams to quit before you even enter the ring," I muttered, narrowing my eyes. "And he's got pretty much the best spot of them all - an opponent who's already fought. Something is up."</p><p>"You think?" Kiba asked warily.</p><p>Kotetsu and Izumo shifted uneasily. Just a little, but I noticed it.</p><p><em> They know.</em></p><p>"I could just be paranoid," I said. "But something's been off this whole Exam."</p><p>"Tell me about it," Chouji agreed, casting a furtive glance around. "You think its… like the Second Exam?"</p><p><em> You think its Orochimaru?</em></p><p>"Could be," I said. I bit my lip. Could I say more than 'something is fishy'? I had no more <em> evidence.</em></p><p>Akamaru barked something.</p><p>"Keep your nose to the ground," Kiba translated. "And be on look out."</p><p>"Sounds like good advice to me," I said.</p><p>The crowd was starting to get restless again, jeering and yelling as the minutes dragged on and the next match didn't start.</p><p><em> What are you waiting for, sensei?</em> I wondered.</p><p>Hayate coughed before raising his hand. "The time limit has expired, so I'm officially calling this match-"</p><p>There was a spike of chakra and a gust of swirling leaves in the arena.</p><p>"Sorry we're late. You wouldn't believe the traffic."</p><p>I slapped my face. "Sensei!" I groaned in exasperation.</p><p>Someone chuckled. "Such a hip and cool entrance, my Eternal Rival. Forcing us all to wait for you like that…"</p><p>I looked up. "Gai-sensei. Lee. You made it!"</p><p>"Yes," Lee confirmed. "It looks like we came just in time. I heard… that Naruto beat Neji. Is it true?"</p><p>"Yeah," I said. "It was an awesome match. I'm sure Naruto will tell you all about it later if you ask him. Do you need a seat?" I asked belatedly, taking in his injured appearance.</p><p>We shuffled to create space for him when another familiar voice cut in. "There room for one more?"</p><p>"Ino!" Chouji said happily. "You're not hurt?"</p><p>She looked a little battered, and had bandages all over, but Ino wore bandages as a fashion statement anyway so it didn't look as severe as it could have.</p><p>"Battered and bruised," she replied cheerfully. "And I have a killer headache. Other than that, it's just my pride. I heard Sasuke was fighting though, so I had to come upstairs."</p><p>"I'm surprised the medics let you out," I commented.</p><p>She winked. "Our little secret, yeah?"</p><p>I was glad to see that she was in good humour even after her defeat. I'd been worried that it would make her depressed. The bench was getting a bit crowded, so I guess it was a good thing that Gai-sensei was content to stand in the isle where he was soon joined by Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>"What's up with Hinata?" Ino asked, eyeing her where she was propped up against Kiba's side.</p><p>"She had a flare up," I explained. "The ANBU back there, the one in the cat mask, healed her, but she hasn't woken up yet."</p><p>I caught Kakashi-sensei's eye, and my fingers curled gently into the hand sign 'person; suspicious' used to identify potential enemies. I hoped he believed me. I could have further identified him as Kabuto but I wasn't sure if Kabuto had been officially linked to Orochimaru.</p><p>"Hi, there," Kakashi-sensei said with a flick of his fingers that conveyed 'acknowledged'. "Sorry about that. You must have been worried."</p><p>"Does this look like my worried face?" I asked flatly. Okay, so I <em> was</em> worried but I had been doing a fairly good job keeping it tamped down, and not seeming high-strung - teasing Kiba, commenting on the matches, petting Akamaru - and now that he'd brought it up I was aware of just how worried I really was. Not about them being late, no, but all the same…</p><p>He chuckled uneasily, scratching the back of his head. "Mah, mah, don't be angry. I wasn't going to let Sasuke be disqualified."</p><p>Which was probably as much confirmation as I was going to get that he <em> had</em> been hanging around.</p><p>I huffed. "Please tell me that you at least saw Naruto's match. He did really well."</p><p>There was a minute widening of his eye. If I'd had more facial expression to study, I might not have even noticed it but since it was the only indicator I had, I did. "He beat Neji, did he?" he asked, deflecting my implied question.</p><p>"Beat him," Kiba scoffed. "Naruto <em> owned</em> him. The match was a complete domination. I don't feel so bad about losing to him now."</p><p>Lee stared at him in round eyed surprise.</p><p>We were cut off as Hayate, finished recapping the rules for Sasuke, called the match start. No one wanted to miss this. There was still water trapped in the craters, which would give Sasuke an advantage if he could force Gaara into them. If.</p><p>"Begin."</p><p>I curled my hands into fists, knuckles going white from the tightness of my grip.</p><p><em> Don't you dare get hurt, Sasuke.</em></p><p>The match hadn't even started and Gaara already looked like he was in pain. That <em> couldn't</em> be a good sign. Not at all.</p><p>"Here it goes," Sasuke said, sending shuriken spinning towards Gaara with a quick flick of his wrist. They were stopped easily by Gaara's sand shield, which morphed into a sand clone.</p><p>Sasuke charged forward with a bout of taijutsu that was very nearly too fast to follow. Having volunteered as Sasuke's sparring partner, I knew exactly what that sand clone felt like as he battered it around, destabilising it and reducing it back to sand. He hadn't touched Gaara yet, but it was clear it wouldn't be long before he did.</p><p>"Incredible," Gai-sensei said. "He's almost as fast as Lee's normal speed."</p><p>"It is almost a mirror image of my own Taijutsu," Lee added. I couldn't tell whether he was upset about that or not, and I didn't take my eyes off the fight.</p><p>Sasuke darted in, a blow landing firmly across Gaara's face, before darting back out of range.</p><p>"So that's your sand armour, huh?" He said almost conversationally. We couldn't really see from up here, but I imagined there were pieces of sand cracking off Gaara's face.</p><p>Gaara didn't reply.</p><p>"I'm going to tear off all your armour," Sasuke said.</p><p>Sasuke ran circles around him, literally. He forced Gaara's sand defence to form a constantly moving circle in anticipation of his movements… then cleanly dove over it to attack Gaara in the centre. He hammered blows home, cracking the sand armour before flipping back out of the danger zone.</p><p>Gaara sunk to one knee, breathing heavily. He almost sounded like he was moaning in pain.</p><p>"It sure looks like it takes a lot of stamina for him to maintain that speed," Lee commented.</p><p>Down in the arena, Sasuke was panting. He burned a lot of chakra forcing that speed, which was one advantage I had over him.</p><p>"What kind of training did you do, to get to that level in a month?" Gai-sensei asked.</p><p>"Hmm?" Kakashi-sensei murmured casually. "Oh. Sasuke had copied Lee's taijutsu with his Sharingan, so I merely had him imagine Lee's movements… and then copy it. Sasuke mastered that taijutsu only because he knew Lee. Of course, he still had to work very hard to master it."</p><p>I blinked. I had thought Kakashi-sensei had copied it and then got Sasuke to copy from him… because otherwise, that sounded like a hell of an exploit. Then again, was that really Sharingan? Imagine how someone fights, then fight like it. Of course, the perfection with which he was pulling it off was almost preternatural.</p><p>"What's more interesting, though," Kakashi-sensei said, faux casually. "Is that nine times out of ten, Shikako can still beat him in a race."</p><p>I could <em> feel</em> the shock from those around me.</p><p><em> Thanks a lot, Kakashi-sensei.</em></p><p>"What? You thought I was just going to take the month off or something?" I retorted flippantly. I'd gained efficiency at chakra enhancing more than increasing my base speed but I had eventually managed to created a prototype air resistance seal to replicate the effects of weights. Those losses Kakashi-sensei was talking about was when I had decided not to cancel the seal before racing. Since Sasuke <em> had</em> worn his weights, I considered it a more accurate comparison.</p><p>He wasn't wearing them now, of course, since the whole point of building speed was to use it against Gaara.</p><p>"But… if Lee couldn't…" Chouji said uncertainly, taking the conversation back to it's starting point. I thanked him silently. "Then how could Sasuke…?"</p><p>"He learnt other things, too," Kakashi-sensei confirmed. "Just watch."</p><p>"What's the matter, Gaara? Is that all you've got?" Sasuke taunted, dodging in and out of waves of sand. Gaara's offence was pretty lacklustre, probably because he was hunched over clutching his head.</p><p>"I'll…" he dragged out, voice raspy. "I'll kill you… your blood…"</p><p>His sand began creeping back to him, withdrawing and forming a cocoon. Sasuke tried to attack, only to stop suddenly, as the smooth outside protruded into spikes, nearly stabbing him through.</p><p>"The sand has covered his entire body," Lee said in awe. "Is that another layer of his defence?"</p><p>Sasuke tried to attack the ball, leaping at it and coming from all sides, but it shot out spikes every time he got close. It was too slow to hit him, but only just. He was using his Sharingan to avoid them, and his movements were jerky as he had to readjust quickly.</p><p>"Hmph," he snorted, unimpressed. His hand retreated into his pouch before emerging with a familiar scroll. He flicked the catch open, gripping the leading edge firmly in one hand before throwing the bulk of the scroll high over Gaara's orb of sand. It wasn't a fancy throw, like Tenten might have done, but a straight line over the top.</p><p>Then Sasuke flared his chakra into it and a wave of water came thundering down.</p><p>Kotetsu made a sound of surprise. "Another water scroll?"</p><p>"Yeah! Go Sasuke!" Ino cheered. "You show that creepy guy!"</p><p>I, for one, just waited to see what the outcome would be.</p><p>It wasn't as good as I had hoped - which would have been complete and utter destruction - but the shell of sand was cracked and only moving sluggishly to repair itself. It was clearly waterlogged. Sasuke tried another taijutsu barrage, but there wasn't an clear access to Gaara himself and he retreated up the wall.</p><p>Then he started gathering chakra.</p><p>"But… it can't be," Gai-sensei muttered.</p><p>"If you wondered why I always insisted on training Sasuke myself, now you know," Kakashi-sensei said calmly.</p><p>It clearly wasn't <em> easy</em> for him to use the jutsu. The slow speed of it's activation, the bleeding of wasted chakra - though it did make an impressive lightshow, it was excessive - the grunts of effort, the distance Sasuke had had to retreat… they all told a story.</p><p>"I… don't understand," Chouji said, frowning at the arena. "What is it?"</p><p>"It's a jab," Gai-sensei explained. "But this jab is a jab like no other. It's the only weapon in Kakashi arsenal he didn't copy from someone else. The secret of the jab is in the speed at which it is delivered and the ninja's ability to focus his chakra at the point of impact. Once these two elements - speed and focus - have achieved certain levels, the chakra actually becomes visible and gives off that distinctive sound that you hear. Like birds chirping. It is this sound that gives the technique it's name; Chidori. One thousand birds. Also known as the lightning blade. It got <em> that</em> name because Kakashi once used it to cut a bolt of lightning in half before it could touch the ground."</p><p>That was a story I wanted to hear, sometime.</p><p>"Yeah, right," Ino muttered, disbelieving. "These old guys and their war stories."</p><p>"Regardless, it's a technique of unimaginable power, requiring almost inhuman levels of speed and chakra. It is a dangerous technique. Not to be taught lightly."</p><p>"Yeah, you're one to talk," Kakashi-sensei shot back at the implied criticism. "Right, Lee?"</p><p>"So it's like the Third Raikage's Hell Stab," I said. It was a pretty famous technique, actually, since none of the Raikage were the type to quit the field once they became Kage like the others tended to do. Right up until his death, there was always the fear of having to face him on the field. That, and Kage were so famous that there <em> was</em> a wealth of information on their techniques.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei's face was absolutely deadpan. "No."</p><p>Gai-sensei laughed heartily. "She has you there, Kakashi. It is true that there are similarities between the two techniques, but there are also large differences." He didn't go on to explain the differences, though.</p><p>Which was fair enough because Sasuke had started running, so I probably wouldn't have listened anyway.</p><p>I held my breath as Sasuke got closer and closer, blurring as he dodged the spikes of sand that tried to slow him down. His arm shot out and buried itself in the sand.</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>Then, Gaara's scream echoed hoarsely through the stands. "Blood! It's my blood!" He sounded more terrified than angry.</p><p>I had to bit my lip and swallow against the bile that tried to rise in my throat. He was, at this point anyway, crazy and psychotic. He was dangerous.</p><p>But that <em> terror</em> …</p><p>He sounded like a child.</p><p><em> Twelve. He's only twelve.</em></p><p>I couldn't, couldn't, look away as Sasuke fought to pull back from the orb of sand, fighting his arm back out. It grasped after him, unwilling to let him go.</p><p>The sand that shot out after him was formed <em> differently</em> . No longer free floating, but a bestial looking arm, shot through with purple. The beginnings of his transformation.</p><p>My teeth clenched together so hard my jaw ached.</p><p>Then the orb collapsed, the sand raining down around Gaara and pooling at his feet. He was clutching his bleeding shoulder, and his breathing was raspy and loud.</p><p>Sasuke was crouched down, watching him and favouring his left arm. Clearly the Chidori hadn't been without cost.</p><p>They watched each other, a serious and deadly standoff across the arena.</p><p>And then the white feathers began to fall.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Invasion: Chapter 34</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - It's just a little insulting to his big, bad ninja pride, that's all. Sure, she can sense the <em> other guys</em> but… but… I'm better than them. To be fair, she only <em> suspected </em> he was there but hey.</p><p>DeeJay-Dubu - You have PM's disabled, so I have to reply here. XD The quotes come from various places. Some of them I already have and am keeping for the right chapter. The rest, I have a vague idea of what I want them to say, or mean, and then go trawling with Google to find something appropriate.</p><p>About the strength of the sleep genjutsu: when the camera is doing the pan around the stands, you can see quite a few of the sleeping people are wearing Konoha headbands. What rank are they? Who knows, but the implication is that the genjutsu is pretty strong.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 34</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Leadership has been defined as the ability to hide your panic from others. ~ Anonymous</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The genjutsu came fast and strong. I could see why the others fell victim to it so easily. The only one who would have been certain to see through it would have been Hinata, and she was already out of it.</p><p><em> Huh. Maybe that's what Kabuto did?</em></p><p>In my lap, Akamaru growled and jumped back to Kiba, who looked dazed but was forming the seals for genjutsu release. Animals tended to have different nervous systems, or at least different sensory priorities which made them difficult to trap and it looked like Kurenai had beaten it into her team.</p><p>I shook the genjutsu off, aware that others were doing the same. Kotetsu and Izumo were up and out of their seats already. Kakashi-sensei had gone straight for the back of the stands where the illusion originated and where I felt a flicker of metallic chakra.</p><p><em> At least he believed me about the ANBU.</em></p><p>Smoke exploded in the Kage's box, billowing out into the air. People were dashing to and fro. It was hard to understand everything that was going on.</p><p>But it wasn't just Konoha ninja that were popping up. I pulled out a kunai and deflected the incoming projectiles - carefully, carefully! There were too many people around - before hopping awkwardly up on the backs of the seats and blocking the flying kick that tried to take my head off. I balanced using chakra to stick my feet steady and twisted, slamming him down onto the ground.</p><p>I was about to follow up with a downward kunai thrust, but Kiba got there first, looking a little afraid and a lot shocked.</p><p>I nodded at him. "Thanks."</p><p>"What the hell's going on?" he muttered, eyes wide.</p><p>"An attack," I said sombrely eyes darting around. I was glad - vaguely and distantly - that they were wearing uniforms. Black balaclavas, grey tunics with black and white camouflage. If they hadn't been, this would have been much, much more confusing. And yeah, with their faces covered like that… it was easier to fight them. They weren't people, they were enemies.</p><p><em> There! A group of four! Scatter them!</em></p><p>I ripped the plastic covering off the back of a seat and focused, slapping an explosive seal on the it, before sending it frisbeeing into the congregated Sound shinobi. Then I had to duck hastily and backtrack because my lapse in attention to my surroundings was almost deadly.</p><p><em> Note to self. Not good for use in the middle of a fight… </em> The set time was too long. <em> Shit. </em> I hadn't thought of that.</p><p>I tumbled to the ground in one of the isles, landing awkwardly, and kept rolling to avoid the kunai that were impacting the ground. The attacker loomed. I tensed, twisted my legs into a position that was painful but would (hopefully) allow me to deliver a full force kick to his face… and then relaxed as an oversize kunai blade slammed straight down through his back.</p><p>"Thanks," I muttered breathlessly to Kotetsu, ducking out of the way and back to my feet, as the corpse fell to the ground.</p><p>"Welcome. But it looked like you had it covered," he said noncommittally.</p><p>I didn't reply, adrenaline thundering in my veins. I glanced towards place my exploding tag had gone off. Three dead. There was another fighting Izumo that had a huge black scorch mark across his side. No damage to the sleepers. Good.</p><p>I ignored the little voice in the back of my head that was gibbering. This large scale attack was different to anything I had ever experienced.</p><p>There wasn't time to reminisce though. Almost as soon as I was back on my feet I was attacked again and I vaulted over a row of seats. Kotetsu was gone, already fighting. I could see Kiba, out of the corner of my eye. There was a flash of movement in the arena as the Sand Siblings took off. I caught sight of other familiar Jounin in other parts of the stands - Asuma, Kurenai, someone I thought was Ebisu.</p><p>There was too much input and not enough time to analyse it.</p><p>I planted another handstand, like I was going to flip away again, then reversed my momentum, slamming a heel drop onto the top of his head. He went crashing into the ground, and I followed through, crouching and slamming a kunai into the back of his neck.</p><p>A blur of black went past, and I automatically tracked it with my eyes. Black ANBU cloak, but the mask was missing. Kabuto.</p><p>He slid to a stop, both feet and a hand braced on the ground. "I see your legend <em> isn't </em> exaggerated, Kakashi," he said, easily.</p><p>Reflexively, I glanced in the direction he was looking. Kakashi-sensei, fighting six - five now - Sound shinobi. That plus Kabuto? Huh. His Sharingan was open but he didn't look injured. Then again, Kabuto wasn't the type to leave visible marks.</p><p>"But I don't intend to be stopped here," Kabuto continued.</p><p>My attention was dragged back to him. I watched him reach for me, almost as if in slow motion.</p><p>Another bonus I had found in using seals vs. weights, was that there was nothing physical you had to remove. It was a seal. You just cancelled it.</p><p>"Kai!" I said, panicked, cancelling the seal and simultaneously enhancing all my muscles. I dropped low, under his grabbing hand, planted my hands on the ground and powered out with a backwards double mule kick that slammed squarely into his chest. He went flying backwards, too stunned by the sudden speed of it.</p><p>I had time to think, <em> Shadow Possession probably would have been better</em> , before there was a blur of green, Gai-sensei chasing after him and following up with a punishing rain of blows.</p><p>"Shikako," Kakashi-sensei said cheerily, landing in a crouch beside me. "No time to be wool gathering."</p><p>"Yes, sensei," I said automatically, feeling more stable already. Jounin weren't just the Elite of the shinobi world, they were the <em> leaders</em> . They were the people who could pull a group together, who could inspire you to fight when everything was hopeless, who could convince you that <em> everything was going to be okay.</em></p><p>Like now.</p><p>"Listen carefully, I have a mission for you," he said, and my heart thumped. "This is an A-rank mission. Sasuke is chasing Gaara and the other Sand ninja. There is no time. I suspect many Sound and Sand shinobi have already infiltrated this village. Sasuke will need backup, but he's also going to be a target. Take who you need and go after Sasuke. You'll be limited to the Genin; we can't spare any fighters."</p><p>I froze.</p><p><em> Me? In charge?</em></p><p>"Shikako!" His voice was sharp and serious. "There is no time to waste."</p><p>I squashed the surge of 'I can't do this' and my fingers unconsciously formed a circle. My mind raced. Plans, plans, I needed plans.</p><p>Sensei slammed his hand down onto the ground and there was a puff of chakra smoke.</p><p>"Pakkun here will track down Sasuke by scent."</p><p>I took a moment to consider how adorably cute Pakkun was, scrubbing his face with his paw like that.</p><p>"You wanna shake? My paws are so soft and supple," Pakkun said, waving a paw at me. His voice was surprisingly deep.</p><p>Bemused, I caught his <em> tiny, tiny</em> paw and shook it. In my head there was a voice going <em> SQUEEEE!</em></p><p>"You, I like," Pakkun announced. I couldn't help but smile.</p><p>"Got it?" Sensei asked.</p><p>"Track Sasuke. Protect him. Stop Gaara," I reiterated. "Gaara has Temari and Kankurou with him…" I was talking more to myself at this point than him.</p><p>I'd need… Naruto, certainly. Which was terrifying because <em> he wasn't here.</em></p><p>Plans started falling into place. "Got it," I said.</p><p>"There's an opening in the back wall. Get ready. I'll cover you," he said.</p><p>I glanced at the back wall. I vaguely remembered seeing Gai-sensei shove someone through it, but it hadn't been important at the time.</p><p>I nodded and darted across the isle, back to where we had been sitting before. I pulled Ino down into the foot space, slapping a spike of chakra into her system before doing the same to Chouji. Lee was too injured.</p><p>My gaze dragged across Hinata and I hesitated. There was no <em> time.</em> Split second decision: yes or no.</p><p>She had been injured. It was unknown what Kabuto had done to her. She wasn't greatly skilled. Stressing her now might cause a relapse.</p><p>But my choices for this mission were limited. After listening to Neji's rant I was reminded of what lengths people would go to for the Byakugan. Leaving her here, alone and unaware, might put her in danger.</p><p>Split second decision; yes or no?</p><p>I slapped a hand down and sent a chakra spike into her system.</p><p>"Kiba!" I hissed, popping my head up for a second. He caught sight of me and made his way back.</p><p>The three I'd awoken were confused, but clever enough to not stand up.</p><p>"What's going on?" Ino asked, glancing up and flinching as two kunai impacted almost right above our heads.</p><p>"We're getting attacked. Sound and Sand ninja. Everyone in the stadium fell under a sleep genjutsu," I summarised quickly. "Kakashi-sensei has given us a mission. Gaara has fled the stadium and Sasuke went after him. We're to go after them and back Sasuke up… and protect him from being captured."</p><p>They stiffened.</p><p>"Hinata, you were healed, but I'm no medic-nin. Can you keep up?" I asked levelly. By all rights, taking her was a stupid idea.</p><p>She looked bewildered. "I- yes! I can!"</p><p>I breathed in deeply. "Alright. Kiba. Take these three out through the exit in the rear of the stands. I'm going to swing by the competitors box and pick up some more allies." <em> Hopefully. </em> "Circle around and we'll meet back up in the forest. They went over the North-West edge, so that's where we'll start searching."</p><p>He stared at me for a second, then nodded. "Right. Got it."</p><p>"Alright, then. Go!"</p><p>There were two ways to the competitors box. The tunnels, and the arena. The thought of being trapped in the tunnels while getting attacked did not appeal to me. That left the arena, which was equally, if not more, dangerous but had more room to move.</p><p>We all darted into action. The four of them went for the exit, I picked up Pakkun and went the other way to the front of the stands and then up and over the railing. My feet stuck loosely to the side of the arena wall, and I half slid half ran diagonally towards the competitors box.</p><p>"You sure about this, kid?" Pakkun asked, thankfully not wiggling. I was running full speed, and a few projectiles were clunking down around us.</p><p>"Ask me again when this is over," I said. "If we win, then I was sure."</p><p>That sounded better than '<em> No, no nononoooo"</em> anyway.</p><p>The competitors box had four chakra signals in it. Shikamaru, Shino, Naruto and an unknown. Naruto's was flat and undisturbed. He was sleeping. The other three were spiking like they were fighting.</p><p>"Hold tight," I said grimly, as we zeroed in on the box. We came in from above, and I grabbed the top lip of the entrance and swung myself inwards, one foot leading in a straight kick. It slammed straight into the Sound ninja's face, knocking him cold.</p><p>"Thanks," Shikamaru panted.</p><p>I stooped and slammed a chakra spike into Naruto. "Don't thank me yet," I said to them. "Everyone still combat capable?"</p><p>Shikamaru nodded. Shino hesitated but did the same.</p><p>Naruto blinked fuzzily at me. "Shikako? What's up with the puppy?"</p><p>"Hey," Pakkun grouched. "Don't you be thinking I'm just a cute puppy now."</p><p>"I didn't say <em> anything</em> about cute," Naruto protested, rubbing his eyes.</p><p>"We're under attack," I said shortly. "And we have a mission. We have to go and find Sasuke and Gaara. We're meeting up with the others in the forest; I'll give you more details then."</p><p>"A mission?" Naruto said, bouncing to his feet. "Why didn't you say so?"</p><p>I resisted the urge to smack him. Okay, I was a little wound up here. I think that was forgivable. "We'll go out front and up over the wall. Be careful. Most of the fighting is contained to the stands, but I got a few projectiles my way when I came down here."</p><p>"Troublesome," Shikamaru said, flexing backwards so his spine cracked. "Lead the way."</p><p>I did. No one took pot shots at us, which was good, because we weren't moving half as fast as I had been. I wasn't entirely confident they wouldn't have hit us.</p><p>We went up and over the wall, sliding down the outside until we reached the trees.</p><p>"This way," Pakkun said gruffly, leaping out of my arms. We followed him, and I spread my chakra senses wide. After the crowding of the stands, it was almost a relief to be able to pinpoint individual people.</p><p>We ran on, and I trusted that the others would be able to find us. With Hinata's Byakugan and Kiba and Akamaru it was practically a sure thing.</p><p>"Yo," Kiba said, as they joined us. It was a big group, now that we were all together. Kiba, Hinata, Ino, and Chouji with Shikamaru, Shino, Naruto and I. Plus Pakkun and Akamaru.</p><p>"No trouble?" I asked.</p><p>Kiba shook his head. "Nah. We're good."</p><p>"Right," I said, and pulled my sealing scroll out of my jacket pocket. I unsealed a box of spare kunai and refilled my pouch. It was a little awkward while running, but we didn't have time to stop. "Everyone, stock up. Ino, Shino, Shikamaru, what's your status?"</p><p>Hinata didn't have her pouch with her, and I hadn't brought extra's of that, so she just stuck a few kunai through her belt.</p><p>"Minor injuries," Ino said. "A little chakra depleted."</p><p>"Same to the chakra," Shikamaru said.</p><p>"My Kikai are depleted," Shino said. "I am in the process of replenishing my hive but… it will take a while."</p><p>"Anything that will help you with that?" I asked. "Soldier pills…"</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>"Right." I unsealed a small medicine bottle and unscrewed the cap. I tipped about five into my palm and then tucked them into the special folds at the back of my weapons pouch. "Soldier pills. Shikamaru, Ino. Take one to recover. Chouji, take some spares. Kiba… do you and Akamaru need them?" They'd had to use them in the prelims for their more serious moves. Which was the same reason Chouji needed them.</p><p>"Yeah," he grimaced. "I didn't think we'd be fighting, so I don't have any with me."</p><p>I threw him the bottle once the others were done with it.</p><p>"Pay you back later," he offered. Soldier pills, like explosive tags, were kinda expensive.</p><p>"Heh," I said, shrugging. "Just try not to get hurt."</p><p>Speaking of explosive tags, I was glad I had decided to bring some. I'd thought, after designing that seal… but obviously it wasn't as combat ready as I'd thought. I pulled out my stack of notes and shuffled some to those who hadn't expected to fight.</p><p>I breathed in, breathed out. "Right. I'll brief you while we're moving. Our mission is to track down Sasuke and prevent him from falling into enemy hands. Our secondary mission objective is to assist him in defeating Gaara. Additionally, the seal that was put on Sasuke was unable to be removed. Kakashi-sensei was able to put a permanent containment seal on it, but if Sasuke becomes too low on chakra there may be repercussions." I was glad that they all knew about the seal already. It meant they understood my worry.</p><p>"Not good," Ino muttered.</p><p>"Right. So. Information you may not know. Gaara is the host of the One Tailed Beast, which means he has incredible destructive capabilities. Therefore, it is crucial that he cannot participate in the invasion. It also means he's very dangerous and we need to take utmost caution in dealing with him. Also, Ino, under <em> no</em> circumstances are you to Mind-Body Switch with him. He is currently accompanied by Temari and Kankurou. I suspect that they're attempting to buy him time to recover so it's likely that one or both will drop back to stall us. It is also possible that there are other enemy shinobi in the forest."</p><p>I glanced at everyone to see if they were following. They nodded. Good.</p><p>"We saw her fight before, but just to recap. Temari is a wind type who uses her Tessen as a focus for her jutsu. She's strong in long range combat but no slouch in close range, either. If she tries to stall us…" I paused. "Ino, you know how she fights. Kiba, do you think you could get around her attacks?" He was fairly fast and agile. Added to that, with him and Akamaru they could attack from two directions at once.</p><p>Kiba grinned. "Yeah. You can count on it."</p><p>"Right. You two are going to deal with Temari. Kankurou is a member of the Suna Puppet Corps. Given Temari's comments earlier and his reluctance to fight in the Exam Arena, it's likely that his puppet is loaded with poisons. Priority will be avoiding contact with his weaponry and poison gases. If he drops back to stall us… Shino, Hinata, Shikamaru… can you handle him?"</p><p>It was a risky group. Two of them had just fought and Hinata had been injured. But Hinata's Byakugan would be able to locate the real Kankurou easily, and she could disrupt the chakra strings he used to control the puppet. Shino's Kikai could do the same. And well, Shikamaru was just plain clever. If they'd been at full strength, three against one would be overkill.</p><p>"We can." Surprisingly, it wasn't Shino that answered. It was <em> Hinata.</em> And she sounded just as firm as I'd ever heard her.</p><p>"Right," I sighed. "I definitely want Naruto to make it to Gaara. Your clones and your summoning jutsu are the biggest advantages we have against him." <em> And Kyuubi,</em> I didn't add. "If we run into other enemies, Chouji and I will be the ones to drop back. Remember the mission objectives and regroup as necessary. Questions?"</p><p>With the teams split up like that, there would be <em> someone</em> in each group that could track the others down, if it came to it.</p><p>Shikamaru cast me a sidelong glance. "If the mission objectives are Sasuke and Gaara, leaving so many of us to fight is counterintuitive."</p><p>Because it was Shikamaru I seriously considered my answer. "If a team can defeat a single enemy and then rejoin us after, it's more efficient than simply leaving one person behind. Given that we're in the middle of an invasion, and there are an unknown number of enemies about, I don't really want <em> anyone</em> undefended. Do you have any better suggestions?" I asked softly.</p><p>Shikamaru hesitated, then shook his head. I glanced at the others. No one said anything.</p><p>"Better put the plan into action sooner or later," Pakkun said. "We're being followed."</p><p>Funnily enough, Pakkun probably had more mission experience than the rest of us put together.</p><p>"Numbers and location?" I asked after a beat.</p><p>"Two squads. No, wait." Pakkun cocked his head, focusing. I didn't know if he was tracking by sound or scent and I suppose it didn't matter. "There's one more. That's nine ninja."</p><p>"Aww, man, give us a break here," Shikamaru moaned.</p><p>I cast my chakra sense as far out as I could. I didn't have <em> huge </em> range, but if I focused… There. I couldn't tell individuals, but there was chakra that way.</p><p>"I got them. Shit, they're moving fast. Alright, people, keep moving. I'm going to set some explosives. Hopefully that will slow them down and thin their numbers. Chouji, stay with the group."</p><p>I backtracked a bit, retracing our steps and hooked onto the branch with chakra, spinning around so I was crouched upside down. They'd be wary of traps, but you couldn't check everywhere.</p><p>My touch explosive seal might not be combat ready just yet, but it was good for this.</p><p>I did some quick, on the fly calculations. How fast they were moving, how long it would take them to get here, how spread out the group was, the intensity it would take to take out nine Chunin/Jounin level ninja, if I could make it a column up rather than a simple ball …</p><p>I amped the radius and intensity up as much as I dared so that we would be well out of range and slammed my hand down onto the underside of the branch. Then I sprinted back after the group.</p><p>It was a tense moment before we cleared the explosion zone and kept running. I counted down the seconds till it went off and tried to track where our pursuers were.</p><p>The explosion was magnificent, if I may say so myself. A flume of fire reached right above the trees, and we both heard and <em> felt</em> the shockwave. Regular explosive tags gave a fireball about the size of a person's body; you had to be really standing on them for them to do much damage. But if they were pocket change explosives, then this was a <em> bomb.</em></p><p>"Hoooly shit," Naruto breathed. "Just how many explosive tags did you <em> use?</em> "</p><p>I grinned and wiggled my fingers at him, since Naruto was one of the very few people who <em> knew.</em></p><p>"Pakkun? Are they still pursuing? I'm still getting chakra signals…"</p><p>His ears twitched. "If they survived it, they aren't moving yet."</p><p>I hissed a breath through my teeth. Couldn't assume they were out because they were down. "Hinata?"</p><p>I watched her carefully. If there was going to be problems, it would show with chakra usage.</p><p>"Byakugan!" Chakra surged in her eyes and the veins bulged. She didn't miss a step as it activated. Yeah, Neji might have more detailed sight better for combat, but Hinata had at <em> least</em> a kilometre in range, not that she needed that much right now.</p><p>She swallowed. "I can count… four distinct bodies at the edges of the blast radius. Anything closer to the centre is… incinerated. Two of them are definitely dead, the other two have large amounts of third degree burns… I can't read their status b-but I don't think they'll be following us."</p><p>I swallowed as well and wanted to close my eyes. But … tree hopping. Not a good idea. "Right," I said, a little hoarsely.</p><p><em> They weren't expecting </em> that…</p><p>Truthfully, I hadn't expected it to get them <em> all.</em> I mean that was the <em> point</em> of it, but I hadn't actually expected…</p><p>We pushed on, chasing after Sasuke. We were covering a lot of ground, but it was a silent and tense trip. Maybe I should have said something to decrease tension and uplift moral, but I couldn't think of anything.</p><p>"What was that?" Kiba asked, when we heard a disturbance up ahead. It was a long way away, but explosions carried.</p><p>"Tripwire traps," Pakkun answered gruffly. I was a little impressed at how easily he could identify the cause, and how specifically. "They're sure not making Sasuke's job easy for him."</p><p>I bit my lip.</p><p>"Don't worry," Naruto said, <em> somehow</em> catching it. "It'd take a lot more than that to get rid of him. He'll be fine."</p><p>"Of course he will be" I said. "But we're supposed to be catching up with him, y'know."</p><p>It was as joking as I could get in this situation.</p><p>"Sasuke has stopped moving," Pakkun said. "But he's still well ahead of us."</p><p>"Fighting?" Shikamaru guessed.</p><p>"Smells like it," Pakkun agreed. "Only one of them, though. The other two are still running away."</p><p>"Che," Kiba scoffed. "Just like Sasuke to hog all the fun."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Okay, so canonically, Kiba took Hinata to the hospital/infirmary/somewhere, and came back to thank ANBU!Kabuto. Akamaru <em> then</em> sensed that something was wrong, and Kabuto knocked them out. This was contradicted a bit in the flashback Shippuden episode, where Kiba and Hinata are both unconscious in the stands. However, I think Kiba could potentially break the genjutsu, so that's what happens.</p><p>Also, interestingly, the mission Kakashi gives Sakura in canon is 'stop Sasuke'. Baffling, but hey.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Invasion: Chapter 35</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Someone mentioned that Shikako could have done something to help the Third Hokage. I've seen many neat solutions to the 'Impenetrable box' Jutsu in fan fiction, and I must admit, my initial reaction was to wonder if Shadow Jutsu could get through the barrier, as it's not physical. Then I thought about just how crazy things would be in the middle of the stands and tried to portray that; Shikako was far more concerned about her immediate survival than seeing what was going on with the Hokage. Yes, Kakashi and Gai were capable of keeping up with fighting <em> and</em> watching the Hokage's fight, but the kids are only Genin and lack that level of experience.</p><p>Nemesis Jedi - Hmm. They are wooden benches but there seems to be a bit of variation in the seats between the boxes. I know they were padded in the 'Elite' box, where the rich people were sitting, so I'm assuming there was at least an <em> attempt </em> in the other boxes. If not… eh, authorial privilege? ^.^ You'll let me get away with somethings, right?</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 35</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Our enemies in this world make up their own rules. If we play their game, if we become like them we lose, we lose big. ~ Bobby Ewing.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>We knew we were catching up when we came across the used tripwire traps.</p><p>Most of them had already been set off, but it did slow us down a little to navigate through them.</p><p>But because we had slowed down, we were able to get behind cover when an absolutely <em> insane </em> gust of wind swept through the trees. Leaves were ripped straight off, branches were shredded, a few older trees snapped off at the trunk and went over completely.</p><p>"Well," Kiba drawled, forearms crossed in front of his face. "Zero points for guessing who's up first."</p><p>I cast a sideways glance at him and Ino. "You two good to go?"</p><p>Ino gave me a thumbs up.</p><p>"Okay, fast burst when the wind dies down. We'll be interrupting a fight so be careful!" I said. If you timed it wrong, you might get attacked from both sides before anyone recognised you.</p><p>Maybe I should have said 'on my mark' because Naruto's concept of 'dying down' and mine obviously weren't the same. Then again, he didn't get shredded when he burst from cover, so the rest of us followed him.</p><p>"Having trouble?" Naruto greeted cheekily, ploughing into the clearing. Well. It probably <em> hadn't</em> been a clearing before Temari started throwing mega wind jutsu around.</p><p>The rest of us flickered in after him, arraying ourselves over the branches in a variety of places. I slid to a crouch next to Sasuke, surveying the surroundings. If I'd been in the mood to notice, I probably would have said we made a <em> damn</em> dramatic entrance.</p><p>Temari's face went from 'determined but resigned' to 'ohshit' in the blink of an eye.</p><p>I cast a quick eye over Sasuke - tired but not exhausted. Maybe half his chakra gone. Uninjured.</p><p>Good enough.</p><p>"Come on," I said to Sasuke, with a tilt of my chin. "Don't take too long, you guys."</p><p>"Pshaw," Ino said. "Ten minutes. Tops."</p><p>"Oh no you don't," Temari murmured, grasping her fan and heaving, probably intending on stopping us from getting past her. But Kiba was way ahead of her, shoulder charging her and knocking her off balance.</p><p>"Get outta here!" He growled.</p><p>We went. I didn't <em> really</em> have any worries about Ino and Kiba. Temari was practically exhausted already and while she was crafty and strong all the cards were stacked in their favour. Frankly, the biggest issue was that they'd never worked together before.</p><p><em> Should I have split people into Team groups?</em> I shook my head at the thought. <em> Too late now.</em></p><p>"Here," I said to Sasuke as we leapt from branch to branch, handing over a soldier pill. "Soldier pill. Take it when your chakra gets low."</p><p>"Thanks," he muttered, tucking it away in his weapons pouch. Given that his Chidori seemed to drain about half his chakra a shot, he'd need it.</p><p>I didn't want to give him more than one since I <em> knew</em> Sasuke would use it. Soldier pill overdose was nothing to laugh at, especially since there were other complications.</p><p>I glanced at his neck, the black seal inert but still present. He caught my glance and grimaced.</p><p>"No trouble?" I asked.</p><p>"Not yet." He shook his head. I had the feeling that Kakashi-sensei had driven him to the point of exhaustion so many times over the past month that he knew how far he could push it before it started acting up. With Sasuke, however, that didn't necessarily mean he was going to stop there.</p><p>"We're here!" Pakkun barked, and we all slid to a stop on the branches.</p><p>"You beat Temari so fast, Uchiha?" Kankurou said before blanching. "Huh. Reinforcements. That's… troubling."</p><p>"Shit! Where's Gaara?" Naruto shouted, taking in the scene. Kankurou was there, but Gaara wasn't. "He got away!"</p><p>"On the ground," I said, almost in tandem with Pakkun.</p><p>Kankurou's fingers twitched, almost invisible chakra strings blooming from the tips. "I can't let you pass."</p><p>"You can't stop them," Shino said blandly. "We will be your opponents."</p><p>"We will handle this," Hinata said quietly to the rest of us.</p><p>Shikamaru said nothing, but I didn't need him to.</p><p>"We'll give you guys some space," I said. "Come on." Getting ourselves out of range would be a wise starting move, particularly if Gaara was about to go nuts and transform. And if Kankurou had area of effect poisons… yeah, distance was good.</p><p>We dropped down, catching the lower hanging branches, and following Gaara's tracks to give them some space.</p><p>"Alright," I said. "We'll get some space, so we don't get mixed up in their fight." I breathed in deeply and let it out, trying to come up with a strategy, the best possible use of the people I had. "Chouji, stay with Pakkun. You are a close range fighter, so I don't want you to engage with Gaara unless absolutely necessary. If you see an opening, use your judgement, but don't get caught by the sand." It … depended. Chouji's Multisize Techniques might come in handy even though he wasn't <em> fast</em> , particularly if Gaara started getting bigger. "I want you to be on lookout for incoming enemies, in case there are more of them in the forest. If anyone gets injured, get them out of the way and protect them." I didn't kid myself that no one was going to get injured. "When the others come, fill them in."</p><p>Chouji nodded seriously. "Right. Oh, man. This is nuts."</p><p>Sasuke was giving me a strange look, but I didn't have time to process that right now.</p><p>"We'll circle around him and box him in. Everyone okay with that?"</p><p>"Yeah, let's do this," Naruto said, but with markedly less enthusiasm than normal.</p><p>Gaara was stumbling along the ground. I don't know if he knew what direction he was moving in. I don't know if he even had any goal at all. He was just <em> moving.</em> Stumbling along, one hand clutched to his bleeding shoulder, the other to his head, mumbling and muttering.</p><p>Alone, I would have been perfectly content to just shadow him, preventing him from returning to the village by way of diversions. Sasuke, and to a lesser degree Naruto… weren't.</p><p>And once Gaara knew that Sasuke was there, by sight or by scent or whatever, he wasn't either.</p><p>"Sasuke U<em> chiha</em> !" He growled out, spinning around on the ground. "Come out! I know you're there!"</p><p>There was unfocused Killing Intent spiking in the air. It wasn't the focused intent of Zabuza or even the coldly dispassionate strength of Orochimaru. It was <em> hungry</em> . Bloodlust.</p><p>"Hmph," Sasuke said, unimpressed as he revealed himself. "I don't know what you Sand Village clowns are up to, but I'll stop you." His eyes <em> gleamed</em> . He was looking forward to this fight.</p><p>"We're so alike, Uchiha," Gaara said. "I don't have friends as you have, but they aren't what makes you strong. It's your purpose that does it. In that way, we're alike. But mine is the stronger purpose, for only by destroying you and all you represent can I even prove that I exist. Only by killing you can I know what life is."</p><p>He was groaning, howling, the sand armour on his face cracking off as he clutched his head.</p><p>We waited warily.</p><p>"You are my <em> prey!"</em></p><p>Sand spilled out of his gourd, starting to coat his arm and face. His chakra was flaring, uncontrollable but stronger and stronger.</p><p>Gaara lashed out, clawed arm trying to grab Sasuke. Sasuke flipped backwards, avoiding the large but surprisingly agile attack. His Sharingan was spinning, picking up cues to allow him to dodge in time.</p><p>Gaara's sand arm was blasting holes through the trees, as though the rough sand was abrading the wood away. That and the amount of force he was using. Another very good reason to avoid being hit by it.</p><p>Not that I needed any more reasons.</p><p>"Why do you hide, Sasuke Uchiha?" Gaara growled, almost like he was taunting. "Do I frighten you? Are you shocked by my true form?"</p><p>I darted sideways, keeping parallel to Gaara and using the shadows of the branches to boost my shadow towards him. I was glad that he was sticking to the ground, it made catching him easier.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete!" I called, and then was nearly knocked off my feet at the sheer <em> feedback</em> from the jutsu. This was worse than trying to hold him in the hospital. I grunted, struggling to hold it. "Naruto! Water scroll!"</p><p>Naruto barely hesitated for a second before darting out with his water scroll and flinging it towards Gaara. I was prepared for it, but nearly hit by the backwash as the wave crested over the ground.</p><p>Gaara howled. I struggled to keep him frozen, not even trying to make him mimic me. My chakra was draining at an alarming rate.</p><p>But his sand was sloughing off, the water soaking in and making it slow and sluggish. The rest of his sand armour was cracked and flaking from the sheer force of the water slamming into him.</p><p>"I will <em> kill</em> you!" He howled, chakra surging higher and higher again, more sand spilling out from his gourd, forming a lashing tail behind him.</p><p>My shadow wavered and broke.</p><p>"UP!" I shouted, leaping straight up into the canopy, just as a claw of sand crashed down where I had just been standing. Dust billowed into the air and there was a creaking groan from Naruto's direction as the tree behind him toppled over. His chakra signal was bright and high in the air, so I knew he'd dodged the attack.</p><p>"This is unreal," Sasuke breathed. "His strength is off the charts."</p><p>"Is your existence stronger than mine? You'll never know unless you fight me! You'll never feel it. Attack!"</p><p>I could tell what Sasuke was going to do even before he started forming the hand seals. Chidori was the strongest attack jutsu he knew, and it was uniquely suited to disrupting Gaara's sand.</p><p>"Over here, Gaara!" I shouted, pelting him with handful after handful of kunai to gain his attention.</p><p>He growled, covering his face with the huge sand arm. The kunai <em> sunk</em> into it like it was quicksand, half absorbed half <em> pulled</em> in.</p><p>"Here! You can have them back!" He shouted.</p><p>They shot back out twice as fast, almost burning with the air friction.</p><p><em> Interesting,</em> I noted, even as I flipped out of the way, ducking behind tree trunks and rolling flat across the ground. <em> Does his automatic defence not work while he is transformed? </em></p><p>He had actually had to intercept them himself, not just rely on the sand to catch them.</p><p>I rolled to my feet just in time to see Sasuke leap forwards, lightning chirping in his hand.</p><p>The Chidori carved right through the clawed arm, lightning disrupting the chakra bonds in the sand, sending it crumbling to the ground. But Gaara just <em> laughed.</em></p><p>"I see! So that's what it is! Now its clear to me exactly why I've been looking forward to this! This… pain… What a thrill it will be to crush such an opponent." His face was twisted into a demonic grin, the sand still coating half of his face and forming that of Shukaku. It looked <em> demented.</em></p><p>Sasuke was panting heavily. As I'd thought before, using Chidori took a lot out of him. One hand was clutching the crook of his neck, right over the curse mark. Shit.</p><p>"Naruto! Get some clones in there!" I shouted, going for Sasuke.</p><p>He swallowed, but formed the cross seal. "Right!"</p><p>I landed beside Sasuke, wrapped one arm around his waist and <em> jumped, </em> narrowly avoiding the flailing sand tail that tried to crush us.</p><p>"Shit," Sasuke breathed, and scrambled for the soldier pill I'd given him before. As he took it, I <em> felt</em> his chakra flare.</p><p>It's said that soldier pills give you enough chakra to run for three days and nights. That might be so in theory, but considering the chakra expenditure of more serious jutsu it doesn't work quite the same in practice.</p><p>"Whoa." Sasuke shook his head and stood, pulling away from me. "That's a rush."</p><p>"Shadow Clone Body Slam!" Naruto shouted, and we jolted, peering around the tree to see a Naruto hurling another Naruto at Gaara. There were clones everywhere and even though Sasuke had destroyed one sand arm, it looked like Gaara had formed another.</p><p>The Naruto hurtled in an arc around Gaara, even as the others dispersed into smoke, using quickly formed Shadow Clones to change direction and distract the murderous Jinchuriki. He landed in Gaara's blindspot, rolled beneath the thrashing tail and took out a single kunai.</p><p>I had a sinking feeling that I knew where this was going.</p><p>"Konoha Secret Taijutsu Technique; One Thousand Years of Pain!"</p><p>"He didn't," Sasuke said. "Please tell me he didn't."</p><p>Naruto used the Replacement Jutsu to get himself out of there just before the kunai exploded, showering sand everywhere.</p><p>"Well, it was a weak point," I said feebly. "The sand couldn't absorb <em> all</em> of the impact."</p><p>"Still…" Sasuke said and shook his head.</p><p>"Is that it?" Gaara shouted, smoke clearing. Sand was slagging off his face, looking halfway between melted and soggy, but even more sand was flowing out of his gourd, encasing his entire torso. There couldn't be <em> that much</em> in there, could there? "That was the best demonstration you could make of the value of your existence?" The sand on his arm bulged and separated out into what looked like small, free floating balls. "Sand Shuriken!"</p><p>Then the world became a blur of high speed, high danger combat as we dodged, ducked, wove and attacked, trying to hit exposed skin and not get caught by sand. I slapped explosive tags down willy-nilly, shock tags - lightning based but not really strong enough to do much to an insane Jinchuriki -, tags that produced concussive blasts… anything I could get my hands on. There was a mess of clones around us, attacking, popping, pulling us from danger… I caught sight of Sasuke, Sharingan spinning, launched for an attack before I had to duck and dodge and focus.</p><p>I got hit by a flailing trail of sand - arm or tail I couldn't tell - and had just enough time to chakra reinforce my entire body before I went slamming <em> through</em> a tree trunk. I wheezed, air forced from my lungs, and slumped to the ground, stunned for a moment.</p><p>Hands pried at my arms, lifting me and moving. Groggily, I saw green and white… Chouji. Good old Chouji.</p><p>"Alright?" He asked, eyes wide and worried.</p><p>"Fine," I rasped. "Gimme a sec."</p><p>There was the sound of chirping birds and the flash of blue lightning through the air. Sasuke was a blur of black moving for Gaara.</p><p>Again, the lightning sliced through the sand armour, scattering and dispersing the sand. We were landing hits, but we weren't <em> progressing</em> . Every hit we landed, Gaara recovered from.</p><p>"I lost everything once," Sasuke said, voice soft and flat, yet managing to carry. "I don't ever want to have to say that again. My trusted comrades falling, right in front of me…"</p><p>"I think that's my cue to get back in there," I said, standing and shaking myself off. My chakra reserves were low but I wasn't really hurt. After a seconds hesitation, I took a soldier pill.</p><p><em> Sasuke was right. That is a rush,</em> I thought. <em> But they taste </em> horrible.</p><p>I darted back through the trees, power flowing through my limbs. It was more <em> agitated</em> than normal, buzzing like static electricity under my skin. It was a heady feeling.</p><p>"Are you afraid of me? Or are you still thinking of the best way to save your friends? Fool. Forget them. Think only of yourself. Love only yourself. That is what it means to be the strongest," Gaara was saying as I approached. He was mostly transformed now, only human legs sticking out of the mass of sand.</p><p>"Oh, shut up," I said, irritated, launching a wave of kunai with explosive tags at the ground towards his feet. They detonated in his face.</p><p>Sasuke and Naruto snapped around to look at me, disbelief and relief mixed on their faces. And so I was the only one who saw the attack coming.</p><p>"Move!" I shouted, leaping away.</p><p>He… <em> it</em> breathed in, gaping maw opening wide. "Wind Release: Sandstorm Devastation!" The wind that gushed out was thick with sand, rough and abrasive and blasting. It was strong enough to disperse Naruto's clones and slam us all into trees. I clipped a branch, anchoring myself with chakra and crossing my forearms across my face to protect my eyes.</p><p>"Attack me, Sasuke Uchiha," Gaara growled. "Don't run and hide."</p><p>Sasuke glared at him angrily. He knew as well as I did that things weren't going in our favour here. He'd used Chidori on Gaara three times, and he was still as strong as ever, if not getting stronger every second.</p><p>Then…</p><p>"<em> Fang over Fang!"</em></p><p>Twin fangs twisted over head, through the air on a crash course for Gaara.</p><p>"No! Kiba!" I shouted, panicked.</p><p>They hit his huge sand arm and kept spinning, <em> drilling </em> themselves into it. Beside me, Sasuke crouched and flashed through hand seals, summoning lightning to his hand once more.</p><p>"Sand Coffin!" Gaara shouted, the loose sand that Kiba and Akamaru were stirring up twisting around to entangle them.</p><p>Sasuke rushed forward.</p><p>I followed in his footsteps, and as he leapt to sever the arm holding them, I ducked down, ready to grab them as they were released. I nearly missed the first one released, as the Beast Clone form of Akamaru reverted in my arms. He was battered and his white fur was stained red but I didn't have time to assess them, slinging the real Kiba over my shoulder and hightailing it out of there. I saw a flash of blonde in the trees - Ino - but didn't stop.</p><p>"Chouji!" I said, skidding to a stop. Then I blinked. "Is that…"</p><p>"Temari. We brought her with us," Kiba explained, groaning and sliding off my shoulder. "Didn't wanna just leave her there." Leaving her alone would have just given her another chance to attack us. Bringing her here, as prisoner, was the compromise between that and killing her. "We thought you guys could use some back up. Didn't realise just how <em> much</em> ."</p><p>"Yeah," I said, biting my lip. "Kiba, I want you to stay with Chouji. Don't attack unless necessary."</p><p>"I can fight!" Kiba protested almost immediately.</p><p>"I <em> know</em> ," I stressed. "Kiba, you saw what jus happened; your Fang Over Fang Jutsu just <em> drilled </em> you into his sand. If we hadn't gotten you out of there…"</p><p>He went pale and nodded. "Aww, man. I hate this."</p><p>"Don't we all," I muttered, turning to dash back to the others.</p><p>"As long as you fight for the sake of others," Gaara spat at Sasuke. "You'll never advance beyond this level. Only one can remain undefeated and only he can know what it feels like to truly exist. Forget your friends and fight for yourself."</p><p>"Why do you gotta go around picking on Sasuke-kun, you jerk? He's had it rough, you know," Ino shouted back, sounding perfectly annoyed and not even a little intimidated, even though her white knuckled hands gave her away. "He's nothing like <em> you.</em> All he needs is a little love and affection."</p><p><em> Ino</em> , I thought fondly. <em> You just have this desire to </em> fix<em> people, don't you? Me, Sakura… Sasuke too. I should have figured. </em></p><p>But Gaara screamed like her words had burnt him. "Shut up!"</p><p>Sand rushed for her, a clawed hand <em> hurled</em> through the air. Ino's eyes widened. I knew with cold dread that I'd never get close in time to help.</p><p>Then, with a pop, Ino was Naruto and the sand slammed into him</p><p><em> Be a clone,</em> I thought desperately. <em> Don't be the real one.</em></p><p>"Now you're just pissing me off," Naruto shouted, from a completely different direction. Ino was standing safe, though terrified, beside him. "I get it. I do. You're no different than I am. Going through life with the exact same sadness and loneliness that I had to carry… You fought only for yourself, never relying on anyone…But you're wrong. Being alone isn't the same as being strong. And trying to hurt Ino, just because she wants to help Sasuke… that's just low."</p><p>Ino was staring at him like she'd never seen him before.</p><p>"I'm not scared of you," Naruto continued, deathly serious. "Because <em> I know</em> that people aren't strong unless they have something they want to protect. And <em> I WONT LET YOU HURT MY FRIENDS.</em> "</p><p>Chakra surged, pure and blue.</p><p>"Mass Shadow Clone Jutsu!" Orange filled the trees. There must have been a thousand of them. "Naruto Uzumaki Two Thousand Combo!"</p><p>They charged at Gaara, a relentless almost suicidal barrage. For every one that Gaara burst, two got through his defences. The combined, choreographed pummelling threw him into the air, whereupon more clones promptly hit him back down again.</p><p>"Is that <em> Naruto?</em> " Someone asked weakly. I didn't even look to see who.</p><p>Gaara hit the ground so hard that it shook. A dust cloud billowed into the air, obscuring even the sky above us.</p><p>"I won't lose to you!" Gaara <em> screamed</em> in outrage.</p><p>Then there was an explosion of chakra smoke and I gagged as chakra filled the air, as thick as water. We looked up. And up.</p><p>"What is that?" Sasuke asked in horror.</p><p>"Shukaku," I breathed. It <em> towered </em> over the tree tops, four maybe five times as tall as the tallest tree. I swallowed. I had underestimated it. I had greatly underestimated just how <em> big</em> it would be. Shit.</p><p><em> If this had been let lose in the middle of Konoha…</em></p><p>The thought flashed quickly across my mind, irrelevant but horrifying all the same.</p><p>"So that's it," Naruto said. "The monster inside of him."</p><p>"Naruto," I said breathlessly, swallowing with a suddenly dry mouth. "Please tell me your summoning contract has some <em> really big</em> Toads."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

XD I haven't given up yet.</p><p>And wow, major thanks to the people who rec'ed/commented on this on Spacebattles. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 36</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Rough waters are truer tests of leadership. In calm water every ship has a good captain.—Swedish proverb</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>We stared upwards, through gaps in the canopy at the monstrous, looming form of Shukaku.</p><p>"Well, shit," Kiba said bluntly.</p><p>Chouji looked a mix between determined and terrified. "I'm the only one that can fight on that scale."</p><p>I wasn't even sure he could. Chouji was hardly a master of the Multi-Size Techniques, and without the pills…</p><p>I didn't think he'd get anywhere near big enough to matter. Maybe he would clear the tree tops, but that was barely up to it's knees.</p><p>"Let's keep that for a backup plan," I said.</p><p>Naruto bit his thumb in preparation for summoning, then paused. "Err. Maybe you guys should get some distance. Gamabunta is pretty big. Don't want him to squash you or anything."</p><p>What had I thought, that we could all stand atop Gamabunta to fight alongside Naruto? Even if the Chief Toad allowed such a thing, we'd still just get in the way.</p><p>"Right," I said, nodding. "Good luck, Naruto."</p><p>I didn't want to leave him alone to fight, but realistically… there wasn't much we could do. It seemed wrong to put it all on his shoulders, as though he was the only one that could save us. It was too much pressure for one small boy. Yet, against an enemy of this scale what could any of us do?</p><p>"Let's move out, people."</p><p>Chouji hefted the stirring but unconscious Temari and Kiba staggered back to his feet. We ran into the others on the way. Shino had a bundled up Kankurou slung over one shoulder. Hinata was breathing hard but no one looked injured. It was a small relief.</p><p>"Please tell me we don't have to fight that," Shikamaru said flatly.</p><p>"Right now, Naruto is going to try something," I said grimly. "If it doesn't work… Plan B."</p><p>"What's Plan B?" he asked, warily.</p><p><em> Chouji's Multi-Size Technique; setting giant explosive seals as close as possible; seeing if Genjutsu worked and trying to lead it into a lake; sending someone running for Konoha to find a Jounin; stuffing Sasuke full of soldier pills and setting him loose with Chidori; getting Ino to Mind-Body Switch and hope it didn't kill her and that she could shut Shukaku down</em> … I had backup plans, but they weren't necessarily good ones. And I was defining <em> good</em> by the very low standards of 'everyone makes it out alive'.</p><p>"I'll let you know."</p><p><em> Come on, Naruto.</em></p><p>Then there was an explosion of chakra smoke and a huge, red toad was rising above the tree tops. We could barely see one of them, let alone both, but I'd say Gamabunta was about the same size as Shukaku. That was a very, very good thing.</p><p>"You know," Kiba said sounding half thoughtful, half baffled. I was relieved to see that Kiba and Akamaru were only superficially wounded, cuts and scraps and not more serious damage. It seemed that the expelled and rotating chakra during the Fang over Fang technique had protected them from the worst of the attack. That made sense, since it was a jutsu that seemed to be created to slam you head first into solid objects. It <em> had </em> to protect you. "I sort of want to ask 'what the hell has he been learning'… yet I don't."</p><p>"This is why you wished Naruto to be one of the ones to confront Gaara?" Shino asked.</p><p>I nodded. "He signed a summoning contract this last month," I said. "Hopefully…"</p><p>The two giant creatures stared at each other. There was a rumbling sound from Gamabunta that made me think he was probably talking to Naruto, but it didn't carry. I had no idea what he was saying.</p><p>Then he drew a sword that was probably larger than the Hokage Tower and leapt. The ground shook like we were in the middle of an earthquake and I nearly tumbled to the ground. Ino and Shikamaru <em> did.</em></p><p>"This… is such a drag," Shikamaru said, not even bothering to get back up.</p><p>There was no way to really see what was going on, not with the trees in the way, and I didn't really want to leave the miniscule cover they provided. Getting any closer to that battle would just be suicide anyway. Naruto had been right to make us move.</p><p>The ground shook more, trees crashed, there were <em> loud</em> booms and crashes. I gave up trying to stand and just clung to the ground like it was trying to throw me off. That wasn't really too far from the truth.</p><p>There was a spike of chakra, a roar, and I caught a glimpse of what looked like an orb flying overhead - <em> air bullet? - </em> before it was intercepted by a glob of water. Cold, torrential rain poured down on us from the dispersed attacks. If that was the force of a deflected attack I didn't want to get hit with one full force.</p><p>"Hinata?" I asked weakly, shivering just a bit at the sudden cold. "Think you can fill us in on what's happening up there?"</p><p>"Good thinking," Kiba said. "I'd like to know if we need to run or not." Akamaru whimpered, though whether it was in agreement, fear or pain, I didn't know.</p><p>"I - umm… y-yes." She folded her fingers into a hand seal. "Byakugan!" The veins around her eyes bulged as her Bloodlimit activated. "Umm… Naruto is standing on top of that toad. I- I think they're trying to get closer to … Gaara." She said the name hesitantly. Knowing that Gaara had the Shukaku and <em> seeing</em> it were two different things. "Gaara is keeping him away with those long distance jutsu… I- I think they're some kind of wind bullet. Maybe?"</p><p>Hinata's narration may not have been the most confident, but having <em> some</em> idea rather than none was a step up. We could catch glimpses of them as they moved and fought, and the jutsus they used and destruction they caused but that didn't give us a clear idea of what was happening.</p><p>Temari and Kankurou were starting to stir, the cold water having had the side effect of waking them up. Temari woke up first, which was understandable given that she'd probably only been clobbered around the head or something, whereas Kankurou would have had his chakra system either drained or shut down.</p><p>Her eyes flared wide with terror, when she caught sight of the sand behemoth towering over the trees. "No," she moaned. "Gaara's gone… he let it out. <em> We have to get out of here.</em> You… you don't understand! You're crazy if you think you can take Gaara like this."</p><p>I glanced at her, straining futilely against her bonds. Her movements were slow and sluggish, consistent with exhaustion. "Unless you have a secret way of containing him when he's like this, I suggest you be quiet."</p><p>"Only the Kazekage can deal with him when he's like this," she said forcefully, at odds with her pleading terrified eyes.</p><p>"Hmm. We're fresh out of Kazekages," I said cheerfully, mostly just to be irritating. I didn't feel particularly cheerful, that was for sure. But we were <em> not</em> going to abandon Naruto.</p><p>"Given the invasion, it probably wouldn't help even if we had one," Shikamaru pointed out laconically.</p><p>Kiba snickered. "Yeah, I can imagine that. Ahem. Excuse me, Kazekage sir, could you please abandon the battle and come restrain your Jinchuriki? It seems to be getting out of hand. Much appreciated."</p><p>Sasuke's lips twitched. "That's rather polite for you<em> , Inuzuka</em> . Not going to just demand help?"</p><p>"Well, y'know," Kiba said, as though seriously considering the point. "Foreign Kage. Got to be on your best behaviour, right?"</p><p>Even Hinata cracked a giggle, at her team mate's mock serious face.</p><p>Temari looked at us in horror. "You're all mad."</p><p>I couldn't exactly argue her point, but that kind of banter was relaxing. There was a difference between being on guard and being strung out to the point of uselessness.</p><p>"Look!" Hinata squeaked, and we all spun around to try and peer through the canopy.</p><p>"Is that-?" Chouji shouted.</p><p>Shikamaru looked thunderstruck.</p><p>But there was none of that terrifying chakra. "Transformation Jutsu?" I suggested as the Nine-Tailed Fox - flipping <em> Kyuubi</em> - leapt over the trees, grabbed Shukaku and <em> bit down.</em></p><p>"Naruto is running for Gaara. The real Gaara, I mean. The human body," Hinata said, flustered.</p><p>We waited with bated breath. I wished I could <em> see.</em></p><p>"He's attacking," Hinata said with a cringe. "And… again."</p><p>The sand starting shaking, like it was falling apart. It <em> was. </em> Whatever Naruto was doing was disrupting the giant structure. He was… he'd done it!</p><p>Then I realised, if the sand was falling… there was nothing to hold them up.</p><p>"Naruto!" I shouted, springing forward into the trees and sprinting for them. It was all I could do to scream his name like a helpless fan girl. I hated it.</p><p>I was aware that Gamabunta vanished in a puff of chakra smoke, either dismissing himself, or having run out of chakra, but I didn't pay too much attention. I was more focused on Naruto.</p><p>The sand was all gone now.</p><p>And he was falling.</p><p>A much smaller fall had done me a fair bit of damage in the Forest of Death, though I had been unconscious and if Naruto was still aware then he'd probably be able to negate most of it. Assuming he had chakra left.</p><p>I raced towards them, over scattered debris and broken trees, over furrowed and wrecked ground. Shouts of surprise echoed behind me, before the patter of racing feet as they followed. We wouldn't get there in time to catch Naruto.</p><p>But we'd be able to see the outcome of the fight.</p><p>I nearly cried with relief when I saw Naruto, battered and bruised and bleeding, with his chakra flickering like a candle in the breeze, but so, so <em> alive.</em> He was fine.</p><p><em> You never give up, do you? </em> I thought with a huge surge of relief.</p><p>"It's almost unbearable, isn't it?" He was saying, as he dragged himself along the ground to the equally exhausted Gaara. "The feeling of being all alone. I know that feeling. I've been there, in that dark and lonely place. But now there are other people who mean a lot to me. Having them around… it makes me a better person. They <em> trusted </em> me to do this. And … I <em> wont</em> let anyone hurt them. That's why I wont ever give up. I will stop you <em> even if I have to kill you.</em> "</p><p>"But why… why would you do this for anyone but yourself?" Gaara asked, his voice soft and empty. The hate and rage was all gone, leaving only broken, wide-eyed confusion behind.</p><p>"Because they saved me from myself," Naruto said frankly. "They rescued me from my loneliness. They were the first to accept me for who I am. They're my friends."</p><p>I landed next to Naruto, crouching down beside him. "Yeah," I said, voice a little shaky. "We'd do the same for you, y'know. You did good, Naruto. You did good."</p><p>He gave me a small, tired smile and collapsed.</p><p>Gaara watched us with eyes that were so very bleak. "Love…" he said, more a whisper than a word. "Is that the thing that makes him so strong?"</p><p>I ran a diagnostic scan on Naruto, surprised and yet not that all that plagued him was bruising and exhaustion.</p><p>"This guy's chakra is all gone," Sasuke reported, crouching near Gaara.</p><p>I heard the unspoken, <em> now what do we do with him?</em></p><p>And wasn't that a very good question?</p><p>The others had followed us, though they'd tried to stick together instead of streaking ahead like Sasuke and I had done. They'd even brought Kankurou and Temari with them, who stared in mingled horror and awe at seeing their brother brought low.</p><p>"Gaara!" Kankurou gasped, wiggling a bit. It didn't seem to accomplish much. "I swear, when I get outta here-"</p><p>"That's enough," Gaara whispered. "It's over."</p><p>Kankurou fell silent.</p><p>"So do we drag them back to the village with us, or what?" Kiba asked, with his customary tact.</p><p>"We should not head back to the village," Shino stated. "Why? Because standard operating procedure dictates we should find a safe location and await further orders."</p><p>"Depending on the state of the village," Ino said slowly, biting her lip. "Taking prisoners might not be a priority." She looked at me trying to convey something important. Ino knew what I did - prisoners would go to T and I, and people didn't exactly <em> leave </em> T and I. She knew it, accepted it… but had never had to apply the idea to a real person before.</p><p>Neither had I.</p><p>"Hmph," Kankurou said, all false bravery. "That's right. When the rest of our forces find out you're holding us prisoner, it wont go well for you."</p><p>Shikamaru raised a sardonic eyebrow. "You're kidding, right? Your brother <em> was </em> the main force of the attack and he fell to a bunch of Genin. I'd be surprised if anyone else even survived. All he's sayin' is that there might not be enough time to properly restrain <em> him.</em> In which case…" In which case they wouldn't survive long enough to be interrogated. Better to lose Intel than risk Gaara recovering and transforming again.</p><p>Kankurou fell silent, likely because he knew it was true.</p><p>We were probably supposed to keep them prisoner, and then they'd be interrogated by T and I about the invasion. Then… disposed of, probably. They were Genin, however strong, and not stable ones. I doubted that they really knew all that much. They might have been considered valuable enough for trade, due to heritage, but Gaara was too much a weapon for Konoha to ever hand him back. We could, probably <em> should</em> kill them. They were enemies, ones that invaded our home and attacked us. But… Temari wasn't a faceless enemy. We knew her name, had talked to her, fought with her; she was young and pretty and vivacious. We weren't hardened enough for that, for it to seem but cruel. The others… after the Forest of Death, heck after the explosion here, they already thought I was merciless.</p><p>I <em> could</em> , probably, do it. But even thinking about it I was aware I didn't want to.</p><p>"So what should we do?" Chouji asked, directing the question more to the group than to me.</p><p>"Let us go," Temari said, jumping on the chance to direct their fate. Her eyes were pleading. "Please."</p><p>She was on her knees, pushed up awkwardly with bound hands and feet. Part of it might have been exhaustion, but she was begging. She was a proud, strong girl, yet she <em> would</em> beg. Not so much for herself, but for her brothers. Even Gaara.</p><p>"So you can just attack us again?" Ino asked caustically.</p><p>"No," Temari said quickly, shaking her head. "The attack… it was never <em> our </em> idea. We were just… following orders." That wasn't a great excuse… and yet in some ways, it worked. People broke orders all the time, and if something was so reprehensible, so morally wrong then…</p><p>But in the world of ninja, invading a foreign nation wasn't one of those issues. Hell, even back Before, a soldier in the army would be expected to do the same. Here, you were loyal to the Village, or you died.</p><p>"We would return to Suna," she continued in a rush. "Straight back. We wont - We wont fight anymore."</p><p>I looked at the others. Uncertain faces stared back at me. At length, Shikamaru shrugged. "Our mission was just to keep them out of the fight, right?" He asked, clasping his hands behind his head and staring up at the sky.</p><p>"We can't just <em> let them go</em> ," Kiba scoffed. "After what we went through to bring them down."</p><p>"Please," Temari begged, seeing her chances slip away. Her eyes darted from one face to the next. "At least… at least let them go. I'll do… I'll do anything." Her voice cracked. People shifted uncomfortably. Her eyes, I noted distantly, were a very pretty blue green. Teal, maybe. They were flickering around wildly, Sasuke to Shikamaru to Shino to Kiba… unsure who she needed to sway to her side. She didn't know, I realised, who was the leader.</p><p>It wasn't an unheard of statement. A bargain of last resort. There were Shinobi Rules against accepting, in Konoha, and it counted as bribery which could, in some circumstances be treason. No one appeared interested, though if that was because they were moral, or because they were <em> twelve</em> I didn't want to consider.</p><p>"Temari!" Kankurou protested, immediately, loudly.</p><p>"Shut up!" She hissed at him, a quick shift back to domineering and in control, though the line of her back was terrified.</p><p>"Ano," Hinata said, very, very softly, tapping her fingers together. Her eyes were cast downwards, towards Naruto. "I t-think that we should let them go, i-if they promise…"</p><p>"I swear," Temari said immediately and a little shakily. "By the desert heat, by the shifting sand, by my mother's grave…" she flinched and glanced at Gaara, almost as though she expected him to react. But he was just staring at her as though he had never seen her before in his life. As if she were something too <em> alien</em> to comprehend. "That we'll do nothing but head straight for Suna."</p><p>I looked around the circle of people. They stared back, unnerved, confused but offering no solution.</p><p>Shikamaru had voted for releasing them, and the rest of Team 10 would stand by him. So had Hinata. Kiba wanted to drag them in. Shino was unreadable. Sasuke hadn't said anything.</p><p><em> Kakashi-sensei gave you the lead. It's your call.</em></p><p>I sighed and titled my head back to stare into the endless blue sky. There was a strange circular rainbow around the sun. A bad omen. But for who? My thoughts were scattered, I knew, probably from the stress.</p><p>I could explain it away. Letting them go released us of the pressure of trying to hold a Jinchuriki captive. With limited information about the state of the village, it could even seem like a wise decision. Taking captives in the middle of a war situation would only tie up troops guarding them. We'd never been ordered to capture them. Our heavy hitters were exhausted - we were <em> all</em> exhausted - and we wouldn't be able to handle a round two. Ensuring the area was clear of other enemies took priority to chasing exhausted, retreating and defeated opponents.</p><p><em> Looks like I already decided…</em></p><p>"The quality of mercy is not strained," I murmured to myself. Huh. Merchant of Venice. Shakespeare. God, I'd hated that English paper. That quote had ended up being in the final exam, too. Pity I hadn't been able to remember it half so clearly then.</p><p>I looked back at her, so proud and kneeling. I stepped forward and slashed with a kunai, lightning fast. She flinched, and the silvery, tendrils of ninja wire broke and fluttered away from her hands.</p><p>"Go," I said flatly. "Take your brothers and go. But remember… you wont get mercy twice."</p><p>She stared, wide eyed, but didn't question the sudden generosity. None of us stopped her as she scrambled for Kankurou, undoing his bonds with fumbling fingers, and as they both stumbled towards Gaara.</p><p>"Was that wise?" Pakkun asked levelly.</p><p>I stared at their backs. They weren't far away. I knew they heard. "I hope so," I said softly. "I <em> really</em> hope so."</p><p>"What was that you were mumbling before?" Shikamaru asked. "About mercy?"</p><p>"The quality of mercy is not strained," I quoted. "It drops as the gentle rain from heaven, upon the place beneath. It is twice blest; it blesses he that gives and he that takes…"</p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p><em> .</em></p><p>So this chapter took forever to write. It really didn't want to be written. I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed with the fight scene. I hope that I explained the reasoning for releasing the Sand Sibs clearly enough. And that the gratuitous Shakespeare didn't bother anyone. Thanks, brain; you're five years too late for that quote to be helpful.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Invasion: Chapter 37</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: One of the downsides/troubles to having so many characters in one place is that it's really hard to juggle them all at once…</p><p>I see the decision to let the Sand Sibs go has stirred up some controversy. That's… good. Controversy is good. People brought up a lot of interesting points (and Pokey, your rant was perfectly okay). Some people thought it was the best decision, some people thought it was so very wrong. It was a hard decision. It might be right, it might be wrong. Maybe there were no right answers at all. But it got made.</p><p>The thing is, it's my interpretation that Konoha places high value on being moral and making decisions in the field based on the information available. In canon, how many times do the shinobi exceed or contradict mission orders? There are filler arcs based on that very premise. Heck, Land of Waves even brings up the issue when they find out about Gatou.</p><p>And a bonus point to consider - Shikako knows that the Sand Sibs would go on to be allies of Konoha and important ones at that.</p><p>Nemesis Jedi - sorry, I have no idea when Spacebattles will be open again. Wish I could help. You raise a good point though. I don't think that <em> any</em> of the other Hidden Villages would be merciful. We already know Mist has no qualms offing <em> their own</em> shinobi… Then again, it's all about the individuals that make up the village, and I've already decreed that Zabuza is far more compassionate than usually depicted. XD So who knows?</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 37</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><em> To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting. ~ e. e. cummings</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Things were hesitant, as we watched the Sand shinobi go.</p><p>"After that fight," Sasuke said levelly, eyes dark and giving no hints of his thoughts. Did he approve? Disapprove? Sasuke, I knew, likely had triggers about families and people begging for their lives. It wasn't <em> the same</em> but… "Everyone in the area is going to know <em> exactly</em> where we are."</p><p>Yeah, giant toads and sand demons were hard to miss.</p><p>"Could be a good thing," I replied, thinking the statement over. "Could be a bad thing. On one hand, if our superiors are looking for us with more orders they'll be able to find us. On the other… we don't know what kind of forces the enemy has, or how they're staggered."</p><p>The implication was there could still be many of them out there.</p><p>I weighed up the options, my brain running sluggishly and tired. But I was in charge, I couldn't <em> not.</em></p><p>"We need to find a safe location to use as a base, and possibly start sweeping the forest," I said with a nod to Shino, who had been the one to bring up the standard procedure. "I'd prefer it if we got some distance from this area. If our sensei need to find us, they will."</p><p>"There's an outpost in the sixth quadrant," Shikamaru said.</p><p>Outpost was stretching it a bit. It was a guard station, a stop along a patrol route around the forest. If I remembered the designation right, it was a solo station, usually manned by a single person, though it might have been increased if security had been tightened. But like all outposts and guard stations, it was a defensible location.</p><p>"Let's go," I said. "We'll approach cautiously in case it's been overrun."</p><p>I hauled one of Naruto's arms over my shoulder, and after a brief pause, Sasuke mirrored me on his other side.</p><p>We took off, Kiba and Hinata gravitating to the front to lead us. It was a much slower trip than either of our previous jaunts, and even though we were still on the lookout for enemies, the atmosphere of the group was less tense.</p><p>"Found it," Kiba said, sniffing the air with a pleased look on his face.</p><p>"T-there is a Chunin approaching," Hinata said softly, tapping her fingers together. "We should stop."</p><p>Stop and let them approach us. Less threatening, that way. We didn't want to suffer through a case of mistaken identity.</p><p>He circled our group once, then landed easily in front of us. He was, like most Chunin, wearing the standard Konoha blues and flack jacket. His headband was worn as a bandanna and he had a small, dark goatee. He was a little battered and had clearly been in a fight or two. He also looked reasonably familiar, and I thought he might have been one of the Sentinels for the First Exam.</p><p><em> That was a long time ago…</em></p><p>Well, not really. But it felt like it. <em> This morning</em> felt like a long time ago.</p><p>"What's a bunch of Genin doing this far out? You guys should be in the shelters, at least." His eyes dragged over our injuries, and the way Sasuke and I were holding Naruto up.</p><p>I fumbled for a second. "We were in the stadium and were assigned a mission. It's complete now. We were headed for the outpost for updates or new orders."</p><p>"I see. Well, I'm Iwashi Tatami, from the outpost if you hadn't guessed. You're all Genin, right?"</p><p>We nodded in confirmation.</p><p>"I don't suppose you know the identification code?" The question was casual, but his eyes were careful. Infiltration was a standard tactic, but that usually came <em> before</em> the fighting.</p><p>"We know the standard one," I said. If there was a new one for the invasion I didn't know it. "<em> Walls of blue flame, a priestly pagoda, glowing ironclad fireflies. Standing upright, silent to the end</em> ."</p><p>The identification codes were a string of basically nonsense words. The one for Genin was different from the one from Chunin and so forth. But the real beauty of them was there were variations - if I'd said 'torch of blue flame' it meant 'I'm doing this under duress'. There were hundreds of variations, designed for circumstances where information couldn't be given freely.</p><p>Memorising them all was <em> crazy.</em></p><p>They didn't actually get used a lot, since most teams knew each other well enough to spot impostors in other ways. Or they preferred to use their own codes since anything 'official' could be 'stolen' more easily. But since we were strangers in the middle of an invasion, something had to be done.</p><p>His shoulders relaxed. "Alright. Lets head to the outpost and I'll fill you in. Anyone really injured?"</p><p>"Nah," Kiba answered, shrugging. "We got off lucky."</p><p>It wasn't really surprising that he hadn't immediately linked us to the fight to the east. They'd have been able to see it, more than likely, but attributing it to a bunch of Genin? Not hardly.</p><p>Iwashi led us expertly through the trees, to a spot where the trees were thickest.</p><p>"Welcome to our humble little abode. This is Mozuku, the other Chunin on duty at the moment."</p><p>I glanced around not sure what he was talking about. I couldn't <em> see</em> the guard station.</p><p>It was Hinata that pointed it out. "In the tree," she said softly.</p><p>Not 'in the trees' like a tree house, but physically built into the trunk of one of the giant 'Hashirama trees'. A little niche had been carved out. Not a big one, just enough to store some supplies, to provide a little bit of cover, for a single person to hide in.</p><p>"I'll take over the patrol," Mozuku offered. "If you want to get them sorted."</p><p>Iwashi nodded. "Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks."</p><p>There was a small clearing by the outpost and Sasuke and I lay Naruto down at the base of a tree where he'd be out of the way. He was still out of it, and likely would be for a while. I gently brushed his hair out of his face.</p><p>"So what's going on?" Sasuke asked, voice calm and serious.</p><p>"Well, I'm going to take it that you know about the invasion," he said ironically. "A combined force of Sand and Sound ninja came in through the forests this morning, not counting however many snuck in with the Exam guests. When the signal for retaliation came, we crushed most of them between the walls and the outer forces. Right now, we're just doing sweeps of the forest to pick up any left over stragglers."</p><p>"Outer forces?" I echoed.</p><p>"Yeah, there's a fair amount of us out here. Chunin, Jounin… ANBU squads." A smug smirk kicked up the corner of his lips. "They didn't know what hit 'em."</p><p>We absorbed that.</p><p>"So what do we do?" Ino asked.</p><p>Iwashi considered. "Well, I don't want to send you kids out on your own. Those of you who are injured can wait here, and I'll take two of you with me, if you feel up for patrolling. Mozuku will probably do the same when he gets back."</p><p>"I'm in," Kiba said immediately. "Sitting around waiting ain't my style." Akamaru barked in agreement.</p><p>Iwashi raised an eyebrow. "I think you'd better put something on those cuts and scrapes first. No point having you bleed to death after everything."</p><p>That was an exaggeration, but it got the point across. Kiba groaned and flopped down on the ground.</p><p>Sasuke stood, brushing off his shorts. "I'll go." I glanced at him, but his chakra was still buzzing from the soldier pill regardless of how many Chidori he had used.</p><p>"Me too," Chouji said suddenly. "Since I didn't fight before."</p><p>I looked at him in surprise. Chouji didn't really <em> like</em> fighting. Unless he was making the point that he wasn't as tired as the rest of us, which was fair enough.</p><p>"Awesome," Iwashi said. "Let's go."</p><p>I felt their chakra dart off, in the opposite direction that Mozuku had gone. I hoped they didn't run into any trouble.</p><p>I stood and stretched, arching my back and wincing as it '<em> click-click-click'</em> ed. Everything felt sore, probably from my impromptu tumble through a tree.</p><p>"Hey Hinata," I said softly. "Could you watch Naruto while I patch Kiba up?"</p><p>"O-of course," she stammered, and I gave her a quick smile. Team 10 had gravitated together, and Shino looked to be meditating or something in the shade.</p><p>I meandered over to Kiba. He didn't move.</p><p>"Yo," I said, dropping down next to him.</p><p>"Hey," he said, less energetic than usual.</p><p>I ran a diagnostic scan over him. "Coming down from the solider pills?" I asked, even though I wasn't sure.</p><p>"Nah," he said easily. "It's just… everything. Y'know?"</p><p>I pet Akamaru gently on the head and then lifted him off Kiba's chest so I could keep working. I unsealed equipment from my scroll and got to work cleaning the cuts so I could either heal them or apply ointment.</p><p>"It's been a crazy day," I agreed.</p><p>"Tell me about it. This morning I'm hoping Shino makes Chunin and Neji gets his ass beat… this afternoon…" he trailed off.</p><p><em> This afternoon we're fighting for our lives in the stadium and then chasing a Jinchuriki through the forest…</em> I paused and rewound that thought.</p><p>"The stadium?" I guessed. It had all been so fast and crazy, but I'd fought. I'd killed people. And if I thought about it… so had Kiba.</p><p>He shrugged. "Yeah."</p><p>"You alright?" I asked, a tad pointlessly.</p><p>"Hey, you're the one doctoring me up." He grinned cheekily.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "Yeah, yeah. Hold still or I'll get out the ointment that stings."</p><p>"I'll be good," he promised. The grin faded pretty quickly though.</p><p>I activated my Mystical Palm Jutsu and started healing what I could. I had plenty of chakra, thanks to the soldier pill earlier but it took more… concentration to focus it. It was wilder than normal, agitated. It was something I'd never felt in my chakra before and it was very <em> strange.</em></p><p>"It's just…" Kiba said, shifting awkwardly.</p><p>"Just?" I prompted softly.</p><p>"Don't get me wrong," he said hastily. "I'm not being all girly about it or anything. But… What makes it different? That we could kill there and not here? That you wanted to let them go?"</p><p><em> I don't know.</em></p><p><em> I killed 13 people today, isn't that enough? </em> I blinked the number away. Nine in the forest. Four in the stands. <em> Shit.</em></p><p>"Did you want to kill them?" I asked. 'Them'. The Sand Siblings. Even thinking about them made my stomach twist unpleasantly. I'd made the decision. Whatever repercussions came from it would be on my head. I <em> knew</em> they'd be good allies in future - the Kazekage even - but that wasn't something I could use to explain my decision.</p><p>"Not really," Kiba admitted. "That's why we tied Temari up. But… back in the stadium, I didn't <em> want</em> to kill him either. I just did it. I wasn't even thinking about it. I just … had a kunai and stabbed. It didn't even really <em> click</em> until just now. It was so crazy up there that it didn't register."</p><p>I hummed. "I wish I had answers for you," I said. I had <em> reasons</em> but that wasn't the same, wasn't what he was asking. "I… They were out of the fight. The guys in the stands… they would have just kept fighting, just kept attacking if we hadn't-" I cut myself off. "I don't, I <em> can't</em> think that mercy is inherently wrong. That killing people is the <em> only</em> answer." Maybe I was just a hypocrite. It didn't matter.</p><p>"Out of the fight," Kiba repeated, he looked strange. A little sad. "They just wanted to go home."</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed. "They just wanted to go home." I swallowed. Blinked harshly. When said like that… I shoved the thought away. "Here. Let me see what I can do for Akamaru."</p><p>I wasn't exactly a vet, but cuts and bruises on a dog had to be pretty similar to cuts and bruises on a human. Anything more serious was another matter, though.</p><p>Mozuku came back and agreed to Iwashi's idea to take two of us with him. Kiba jumped on the chance and Shino unfolded himself to go along with them.</p><p>"Well," I said blankly to the air.</p><p>Yup, being a ninja wasn't all hectic chases, dangerous fights and heart-rending, life-and-death decisions; a great majority of it was sitting around waiting with absolutely no clue what was going on in the village. The Chunin had told us what they could, but they didn't have up to date info either.</p><p>How were people fairing? How many enemies were there? How much longer would the fighting last?</p><p>We waited. And waited. Iwashi and Mozuku swung by to check on us and it didn't look like patrols were particularly exciting either. It was nearly sundown before we heard the ringing of the bells. Church bells, I would have said, though the local equivalent wasn't the same. But sound carried, so it was an effective way to communicate over a wide area.</p><p>"Guess the fighting's over," Ino said, listening.</p><p>"They'll be sending out runners, then," I hazarded a guess. "Orders for the outpost shinobi."</p><p>"I hope everyone is alright."</p><p>The two patrol groups came back just in time to meet the arrival of another Chunin.</p><p>"Iwashi, Mozuku," he greeted, seeming to know them. They waved back. "They're dropping the security level back down to 3, so only one of you has to stick around till shift-change."</p><p>Briefly, I wondered who was going to be taking the next shift. Surely every able bodied ninja had <em> been</em> fighting.</p><p>"There are check-in stations just inside the gates," he continued. "They've got more info about the village status. And new assignments." He smirked briefly.</p><p>"Here's hoping my 'new assignment' is eight hours sleep," Mozuku said, stretching.</p><p>"You'd be so lucky," the new Chunin returned. "I've got twelve more guard stations to visit."</p><p>"Level three, huh?" Iwashi muttered. "That's still pretty tight."</p><p>"Just in case there's a second attack, I guess," Mozuku said. "Anyway. I did less fighting than you, so you should take the Genin back to the village."</p><p>Iwashi hesitated, then shrugged. "If you're sure. Come on, kids. Time to go home."</p><p>Kiba muttered something about 'not a kid', but I just scrambled over to Naruto and tried to wake him. Still out of it. Which was fair enough, I guessed, since it had taken him three days to sleep off his last bout of chakra exhaustion. I pulled his arm over my shoulder with a groan and was thankful when someone took his other side and halved the weight I had to carry.</p><p>"Hey, Sasuke," I rasped. "You're being pretty quiet over there."</p><p>He shrugged. "Hn."</p><p>I sort of wished I knew what he was thinking. Was he relieved we'd survived? Upset that Naruto was the one to manage what the rest of us couldn't? Annoyed that the Exams were disrupted? Worried about the village?</p><p>Now wasn't really the time to ask, though.</p><p>The Chunin at the check in station took one look at us and shook his head. "If you're exhausted, go home. Everything is mostly covered now. The map shows the areas of high damage, and we have a list of known casualties and evacuation spots if you're looking for people."</p><p>We signed in, and I scrambled for a minute trying to remember Naruto's ID code, and reassured everyone that he was just exhausted and not injured.</p><p>We glanced at the damage report. The area that contained Naruto's apartment was shaded black - high damage - while Sasuke's was red - moderate damage.</p><p>I made the executive decision. "You two are coming home with us. Don't even argue." I couldn't in good conscious just ditch Naruto while he was like this, and I didn't want to let Sasuke go either.</p><p>Shikamaru just shrugged and yawned.</p><p>"Fine," Sasuke said. We sort of made dinner at my place a tradition after a big mission, and while this wasn't quite the same, I guess it was close enough.</p><p>"Alright," I said, and then yawned. "Let's call this day done."</p><p><hr /></p><p>*cough* Yeah, so the pass phrase is a Bleach kido. Those things are weird.</p><p>Mozuku and Iwashi are canon characters. So says Narutopedia. XD</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Invasion: Chapter 38</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Summons do tend to show up a lot, so that's where my 'they're common' comes from. And I'm assuming Shippuden Sasuke got his Hawk contract from the Uchiha hideout. I don't know if it was ever stated where that came from.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 38</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> A hospital alone shows what war is. ~Erich Maria Remarque</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"But then I was like 'aww, Boss, there aren't any other toads that are as big and as awesome as you' and he was like 'well, you're right about that, brat' even though I probably didn't have enough chakra to summon any other toads <em> anyway</em> and I've only had the contract for a little while so it's not like I know all the toads, either…"</p><p>I listened with half an ear to Naruto's story, even though it was interesting - and <em> oh god, what if Gamabunta hadn't helped?</em> - as I made breakfast. The kitchen door was open, and I could hear the three of them at the table as Naruto enthusiastically regaled us with what had happened during the fight we had missed.</p><p>He was still a little low on chakra - for Naruto, anyway - but apart from a few yawns had bounced right back.</p><p>"Where'd you get a summoning contract, anyway?" Sasuke asked curiously.</p><p>"The pervy sage had it," Naruto replied and I could hear the shrug. "He let me sign it when I got him to teach me for the Exam."</p><p>"Most clans have a few summoning scrolls," I chimed in. "They aren't exactly rare." I hesitated, the ploughed onwards. "I'm not sure how organised the Uchiha were, but you've probably got a few hidden away in the compound."</p><p><em> Assuming they haven't been looted or anything.</em></p><p>"Hn," was all Sasuke replied with. The Uchiha… that was a topic that got tiptoed around and circumvented so obviously it did nothing but highlight the issue. Even I was guilty of it. I <em> wanted</em> to help Sasuke, but how?</p><p>I could hardly tell Sasuke the real culprit was Konoha itself. This was just a no-win situation.</p><p>But yes, summons are actually pretty common. There are thousands of different scrolls, some large, some small. For example the Great Toad Contract has several thousand summons attached to it, while Kakashi-sensei's dog contract has maybe a dozen. The problem is that it takes such a large amount of chakra to summon, and not all summons are equally good in battle situations. Added to that, summons are individuals. Not all of them are happy to be summoned. I think a prime example of that is Manda the snake boss, who demands a hundred sacrifices each time he is summoned.</p><p>"Do you have one?" Naruto asked curiously. "Shikako?"</p><p>"Me? Ah, no. I don't have the chakra for it," I said. "I might sign one when I'm older though. They're pretty neat."</p><p>I was struck by just how <em> bizarre </em> and <em> domestic</em> this scene was. My hand trembled on the counter and I clenched it into a fist to stop the shaking. Yesterday… we were fighting for our lives. We were… <em> at war.</em> This morning I'm cooking breakfast and we're chatting like nothing happened.</p><p>There was just a sense of … unreality to it.</p><p>I breathed in and shook it off.</p><p>Of course I was cooking breakfast. We needed to eat before we could go and help the clean up or whatever was going on this morning. Simple. Logical.</p><p>I dished up the rice and miso soup - a simple but traditional breakfast - and added an extra bowl since I could feel Mum stirring awake upstairs. She'd come in late last night and I had the vague feeling that Dad had come in even later and left extremely early this morning.</p><p>Naruto had gone back to talking and I was glad, as I carried the food out and sat at the table, because it had covered my awkward silence.</p><p>"- but Gamabunta couldn't hold onto the sand, because, y'know toads don't have claws, so he was like 'well, we'll have to do a Combination Transformation Jutsu' and I was like 'what?' and he was just 'think of something with teeth and claws' and heck, I couldn't think of anything <em> but</em> then I thought of Kyuubi, so that's what we turned into and hey, he has teeth and claws-"</p><p>Sasuke frowned. "Why on earth did you think of the Nine Tailed Fox?"</p><p>Naruto <em> froze.</em> "Ehehe, well… uh…"</p><p>I nodded encouragingly at him. Shikamaru and I knew. I thought it would be a good thing if Sasuke did too, being as how he was our team mate.</p><p>"Uh, well…"</p><p>"Spit it out, dead last," Sasuke ordered.</p><p>Naruto took a deep breath. "Well. Y'know how Gaara was the host of the Ichibi?"</p><p>"Obviously," Sasuke said, a touch sarcastically. "Since that's the whole reason we had to fight him."</p><p>"I'm the host of the Kyuubi." Naruto said it in such a rush, as though saying it faster would make it easier to get out. Then he looked down at his soup and didn't look back up.</p><p>There was silence.</p><p>I glanced at Sasuke cautiously. His face was frozen in a combination of confusion and disbelief.</p><p>"It's not quite the same, though, is it," I said tentatively, trying to direct the conversation to a safe end. "I mean, you can't do the same… transformation thing, right?" Or not until much, much later anyway.</p><p>"Well," Naruto said uncomfortably. "It's not like I've ever really tried. I mean, the only times I've used it were when the pervy sage threw me off a cliff and … in Wave Country when…" he trailed off.</p><p>"And in the Forest of Death," Sasuke said, as though adding things up. "When you attacked Orochimaru. Your eyes… they were red. He said something, too… I wasn't paying attention at the time…"</p><p>"<em> When your anger is roused, some of the Nine Tailed Fox's chakra is released. What an interesting childhood you must have had."</em></p><p>I was kind of surprised <em> I</em> remembered what Orochimaru had said, but his voice had a way of burning itself inside your brain.</p><p>"Yeah, so," Naruto coughed, awkwardly, clearing his throat. "I didn't even know about it till after graduation." He shrugged. "It … yeah."</p><p>"You two already knew," Sasuke stated, looking from me to Shikamaru and back. It wasn't even a question.</p><p>"Remember how I told you about running into Gaara at the hospital?" I asked. "It came out then. I figured that it was up to Naruto to tell you, and we didn't exactly have time what with everything else."</p><p>"The adults all know," Shikamaru added. "Most of the kids don't, but I guess some of them will put it together after that."</p><p>Naruto shrugged uncomfortably. "Yeah, I guess."</p><p>"But it's not such a big deal," Shikamaru went on, a teasing glint in his eyes. "I mean, it's <em> Naruto.</em> "</p><p>"Hey! What's that supposed to mean?" Naruto protested.</p><p>"Oh, like you don't know," Shikamaru retorted.</p><p>I tuned out their bickering and turned to Sasuke with a raised eyebrow. He gave me a slow nod. "It makes sense," he said.</p><p>Right, so that was one drama out of the way.</p><p>"Morning, kids," Mum said, coming into the room.</p><p>"Morning," I said reflexively as she sat down. I couldn't help but stare, just a little bit.</p><p>I <em> knew </em> she was a ninja. She trained with us, taught us, and it had never been a secret that she had been a Chunin. But seeing her dressed in blues and flack jacket for the first time that I could remember really make it <em> real.</em></p><p>It might have even been the first time I had seen her wearing her headband.</p><p>My mother, the shinobi.</p><p>With Dad, I had always known there was no separation between home and work. He was a shinobi was a shinobi was a shinobi. It wasn't a bad thing, but we talked about shogi and missions and books and morality with no clear distinction between the topics.</p><p>But Mum had <em> always</em> been 'home'.</p><p>I wasn't really sure I liked this.</p><p>She looked up and caught my eye. "In a state of emergency, all able-bodied ninja are expected to be ready for duty. Since you two are out of the house, that includes me," she said by way of explanation.</p><p>I nodded silently. I knew the protocols. But the way Mum said it made it sound like she knew from <em> experience, </em> not from rules.</p><p>"Wait…" Shikamaru drawled. "State of emergency?"</p><p>"You haven't heard? No, of course you haven't. The official word went out late last night," Mum said tiredly. "The Hokage… is dead."</p><p>"What?" Naruto croaked, looking like the world was falling down around his ears. He shook his head. "No. Nonono…"</p><p>Because, while to us the Hokage was a leader and a powerful figure, to Naruto he was a <em> person</em> .</p><p>I knew him as the guy behind the missions desk, the guy that gave speeches at the Academy every year, important but distant while Naruto knew him as a grandfather that took him out to ramen and told him off for pranking.</p><p>I hissed a breath.</p><p>"How?" Sasuke asked dully.</p><p>"Orochimaru was disguised as the Kazekage and managed to isolate him during the battle. They fought. Hokage-sama used, or attempted to use, a suicide jutsu. Orochimaru was heavily wounded, but managed to escape." Her tone was flat and matter of fact, as though reciting a report. All the important facts were there but…</p><p>"Why did it take so long?" I asked. Surely that had happened before we got back. Why hadn't we found out last night? Not that it would have been <em> better</em> but…</p><p>"While battle protocols can run perfectly fine without the Hokage, or a lot of the upper ranks, bureaucracy is a little slower <em> after</em> battles. It took a while to sort out who was in charge, what was happening, and what to do about it. A lot of people knew by word of mouth before the official announcement went out," she said.</p><p>"Oh. No wonder Dad was out so late," I said.</p><p>"Yes. He's going to be very busy for the next few days." Or weeks. Or months, she didn't say, but there was a frown creasing between her eyes that said she knew it.</p><p>The rest of breakfast was spent in awkward silence. Naruto was silent, grieving. I wanted to comfort him, but wasn't sure what to say. I hadn't been exactly <em> surprised</em> with the information. I had <em> hoped</em> that enough had changed but…</p><p>Well. A suicide jutsu was a suicide jutsu. The clue was in the name.</p><p>Outside, one of the first things I noticed was that the flags were all flying half-mast and that they were all the red of 'state of emergency'. After seven, the message system started repeated a blip every half hour of 'Hokage down. State of Emergency in effect. All ninja report to temporary stations'.</p><p>Well, at least they'd given us time to sleep. That was unusually kind of them.</p><p>Therefore it was unsurprising to see the area around the Hokage Tower flooded with people. The Mission Assignment Desk had been moved outside and there were lines of people in front of it, with flustered Chunin trying to hand out assignments. There were several message boards posted around the area and we meandered over to one.</p><p>Like the check in station last night, there was a map of damage, a list of injured and a list of casualties. There was also an announcement sheet.</p><p><em> State of Emergency Enacted…</em></p><p><em> Death of the Third Hokage…</em></p><p>…<em> remain calm… complete duties… </em></p><p>…<em> Memorial tomorrow…</em></p><p>It was cold. I was glad that Naruto hadn't had to find out like this, even if the news hadn't exactly been broken easily.</p><p>We joined the queue. They were actually moving pretty fast despite the large number of people involved. You had to give ninja that; they were efficient. I thought about asking Shika if he wanted to wait for Team 10, but there was no guarantee that we would be sent out in teams anyway. Mum got split off from us to go and relieve one of the Chunin patrols and she left us with an admonished 'be good' that made Shika roll his eyes.</p><p>"Rank?" The Chunin at the desk said, sounding rushed.</p><p>"Genin," we chorused.</p><p>His eyes flickered up and took us in before making a snap decision and snagging a scroll. He took down our ID numbers, hastily scribbling them on the assignment sheet before throwing it to us. "Clean up. Sector 9-b. Next!"</p><p>We scampered out of the way and unrolled the scroll. It had directions and instructions. What to do, who to report to, where to go.</p><p>I almost expected Naruto to protest about being on clean up duty, but he didn't say a word.</p><p>"Troublesome," Shikamaru said.</p><p>Sasuke shrugged. "Let's go."</p><p>Walking through Konoha this morning was a little disturbing. We hadn't noticed it last night, too late and tired, but there were scorch marks, and knife marks and blood splatters on the buildings and streets. There was evidence of fighting.</p><p>The worst of the damage was along the wall, where a giant snake had apparently crashed straight through it but the rest of the village wasn't unscathed either. There were destroyed buildings and jutsu damage everywhere.</p><p>Like seeing Mum in uniform… it was just <em> wrong.</em></p><p>We reported in to the Chunin in charge of overseeing Sector 9. He looked tired, like he'd been working for hours already, but apart from being a little gruff accepted us easily. "Alright, you're on clean up duty. That means; picking up loose weaponry, removing them from walls, plastering over holes, cleaning up glass and noting broken windows, and washing away blood splatters. There's buckets, plaster and water over there." He jerked his thumb to the side. "If you see a trap, or think you see a trap, come get me and <em> I'll</em> dismantle it. The boundaries of your area are marked on the map, so you shouldn't have any problems. With the four of you, it should take about an hour, maybe a little longer, which is good. This is a residential area, so we'd like to have it marked 'safe' before the civs get back."</p><p>He vanished, presumably to go and repeat the speech to others in other sectors.</p><p>There was a reason that this was a job given to Genin rather than civilians. Even though it wasn't dangerous we were still handling weaponry, and also… wall walking made the whole thing about a million times easier. I took an empty bucket and started filling it with discarded weapons, and then as an afterthought grabbed a can of plaster and a trowel so I could fill in the holes while I still knew where they were.</p><p>After a bit of boredom, I started using chakra strings to pick up the loose kunai on the ground. I wasn't quite coordinated enough to use them to yank out embedded ones, but it saved me from having to go right down to pick them up.</p><p><em> Thy name is laziness</em> .</p><p>We found kunai and shuriken and senbon. A few tanto and a tachi and a wakizashi. And, in one memorable case, a dead body that had been missed during last nights clean up.</p><p>It wasn't a trap, but we got the Chunin anyway since we had no idea what to do with it. If civilians were going to be coming by, we really didn't want to leave it around.</p><p>"You kids never made a body scroll before?" He asked with a sigh. We shook our heads. "Figures. Alright, watch carefully. It's pretty similar to any other kind of storage scroll, in any case." He pulled a blank scroll out of one pocket and a brush and some bottled ink out of another.</p><p>He spread the scroll out on top of the body, bleed into the ink and started writing. Given the surety of his movements, I had the feeling he'd made more than a few of these in his time. The symbols were fairly familiar, particularly to the storage seals you used for food, which made sense because bodies were organic and you didn't want them to decompose. There were stabilising seals that helped account for the <em> size</em> since the body was bigger than the paper it was going to be sealed into.</p><p>"Seal," the Chunin commanded, clapping his hands down on the scroll. There was a puff of chakra smoke and the body vanished. The ink sort of… <em> twitched </em> and <em> swirled</em> before settling with the kanji for 'corpse' appearing in the middle of the sealing circle.</p><p>He rolled the scroll up with an expert flick of his wrist, and painted a quick black band around the edges of the scroll. "The black band doesn't do anything," he said, noticing our looks. "But it lets people know there's a body in there, so they don't go around opening it to find out. Sort of a polite thing to do, yeah?"</p><p>He chucked it into one of our buckets and told us to get back to work. It didn't actually take us long to finish up. The worst part was trying to scrub the blood off. I'd never found cleaning very fun, and knowing <em> what</em> I was cleaning up wasn't really helping.</p><p>But we did it, and the Chunin made a quick check over our sector before nodding and signing off on our mission scroll. "Good work. Thanks."</p><p>We trooped back to the Mission's Desk, which wasn't any quieter now than it had been before. I guess that was to be expected. Not only was there increased patrols, and clean up duties, and whatever else had been produced by the invasion, but the village still had to run itself with day to day administration <em> and</em> we were still taking on missions. And, I guess, pacifying the nobles and lords that had come for the Chunin Exam and ended up in the middle of a battle.</p><p>This time we were split up. I got assigned to go run supplies for the hospital, while the boys got sent off to haul rubble or something for the construction site.</p><p>The hospital actually had sub-basement storage where all the extra supplies were kept (or most of them, anyway. There were probably other supply depots around the village <em> just in case</em> ) but the hospital staff were so run off their feet that people were needed to transport them from the storage rooms, up the stairs and into the places where the nurses and doctors could get at them.</p><p>I reported into the receptionist, who directed me to the Head Nurse, who gave me a code for the doors and a list of things to bring up, all in between snapping someone for messing up … something, giving orders to three more orderlies and drinking her coffee. Now that was multitasking.</p><p>I weaved my way through bustling crowds and slid off down the stairs before <em> I</em> gained her ire. Everyone in the halls had the same kind of harried and stressed expression on, like they'd had one cup of coffee too many, one hour of sleep too few and the end of the world was right around the corner.</p><p>It took a few moments to orient myself in the huge storage basement, but I did and I started gathering the supplies for the pharmacy, since having the right drugs on hand was kind of crucial. I made doubly sure to check the names on the bottles - long and confusing though they were - to make sure I had the right stuff.</p><p>Then I hauled the very heavy box upstairs, unloaded it in the pharmacy under the watchful eye of the on duty nurse who made sure everything went in the right place when she wasn't filling orders for everyone else.</p><p>Then I went back downstairs to do it all again.</p><p>It was dull, boring work, but it needed to be done and I was a Genin which practically translated to dogsbody or gopher or possibly minion if they were feeling generous. Besides, I wasn't so sure I could handle anything <em> exciting</em> right now.</p><p>It was about an hour later when I'd been moved on to transporting bed sheets from the laundry to the linen closet that I ran into Sakura.</p><p>"Oh!" She made a little sound of startlement.</p><p>"Sakura?" I asked in surprise as I opened the door to the linen closet - that was the size of a small room - and put down the basket of white cloth. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>She was wearing her usual red dress, but she had a white smock thrown overtop complete with the red medics mon with the qualifier 'in training' underneath. Her hair was tied back in a low ponytail and I nearly hadn't recognised her.</p><p>"Working," she explained, hands fluttering. "Yesterday… all of the trainees were called in to help, even those of us who had just started. I mean, we weren't working with the patients or anything, just doing fetch and carry basically. To free up hands to deal with the serious stuff. Every bit counts, right?"</p><p>"Hey, I'm folding laundry. You don't have to convince me." I gave a pointed shake of a white sheet as I creased it together and slid it onto the shelf.</p><p>She gave a quick smile. "I'm making beds, so I think we're even." She hesitated. "You know, yesterday… I kept wondering if next time I went past the ER it would be one of you guys. That someone I knew would be brought in…" She gave me a searching look.</p><p>I didn't want to think about how badly messed up some of those people would have been, or how very, very easily that could have been us.</p><p>I leant forward and gave her a quick hug. "We're all fine. I'm sorry I didn't think to contact you or anything. I can't promise it will never happen… but for now we're all fine."</p><p>However close it had been, we were all fine.</p><p>Sakura shrugged, but she looked much happier and calmer. "I was here all day, so it'd probably have been hard for you to find me," she excused. "It was pretty crazy in here; everyone was run off their feet all day. I think I'm starting to see why there are four different coffee machines in the nurses lounge."</p><p>"Coffee makes the world go round," I said, amused. Not that I tended to drink it here. Twelve year old taste buds <em> did not like.</em> I'd give it a few years.</p><p>"You'd fit right in," she joked. "But… I better get back to it. I'll catch up with you later, okay?"</p><p>"You bet," I said.</p><p>I finished up at the hospital and went back to the Missions Desk to get assigned to gopher paperwork around the Hokage Tower. That let me stick my head in Dad's office and wave on my way past, but he looked <em> way</em> too busy for me to stop and chat.</p><p>I kept wondering if I was going to be asked to give a debriefing on what had happened in the forest, but other than the brief written report I'd handed in automatically, nothing came of it. Then I had the face smacking realisation.</p><p>There were far more important things going on.</p><p>It was strange to think that the fight - the decision - that had been life or death for us was barely a sidenote to the rest of the village. They had been focused on the Hokage, on the giant summoned snake that destroyed the east wall, the legions of ninja darting through the village streets. That we had returned alive, and that Gaara had not rejoined the fight seemed to be all that they cared about. If they even registered that it happened at all.</p><p><em> You are not the centre of the universe.</em></p><p>Right. Like I needed a reminder about <em> that.</em></p><p>Still, it was good to keep things in perspective, wasn't it?</p><p>Shaking my head, I finished my gophering and returned to the Missions Desk, noting that the village was starting to become more lively as civilians were 'un-evacuated', a process that sometimes took as much effort and coordination as the evacuation itself.</p><p>It might have seemed cruel and needless to keep them in the evac shelters for what was essentially two days, give or take - I didn't know when they'd gone in, but it was probably the night before the Chunin Exams, so that none of the visitors would notice - but there <em> had</em> been the threat, however vague, of a second attack, or of booby traps or a dozen other things that could have endangered everyone. The evac shelters weren't luxurious, no, but they were designed for worst-case-scenario long term use.</p><p>Now that clean up was almost done, barring the more destroyed areas that would need to be rebuilt, and patrols re-established and all the other things that would keep the village safe, it was safe for them to come back out.</p><p>Civilians that live in Hidden Villages are a curious bunch. They aren't ninja and it shows; there's a huge divide between the shinobi and the civilians. But they <em> know</em> ninja. Almost everyone has a brother-sister-uncle-best friend-cousin-next door neighbour who is a shinobi. They understand us from the outside. And because of that they have their own kind of courage.</p><p>They walk the streets with murderers and they know it. They sell fruit to a guy that can burn down buildings with an exhale, clothes to people that will only rip-tear-shred-<em> bleed on </em> them. People race over their rooftops at all hours of the night. And when the call to evacuation goes around, they calmly pick up their emergency bags and go.</p><p>And when it's over, they come outside, take stock of the damage, breath a sigh of relief, and move on.</p><p>They're not ninja. But they don't let it phase them.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Given that Shippuden currently feels like 'One Hundred And One Ways To Deal With Zombies' the Third Hokage's choice is a little… meh. They learnt from his experience, perhaps?</p><p>Also, its interesting that he sealed the First and Second first and not Orochimaru. It'd be and interesting AU if he managed to kill Orochimaru but then died, leaving immortal zombies to terrorise the village. *ponders* Pre time-skip, who could deal with them?</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Chunin Exams Arc - Invasion: Chapter 39</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: So, including the prologue, this makes 40 chapters. That's waaay longer than I ever thought this was ever going to be and we're not that far along, plot wise. The real question, therefore, is… do I keep updating under the same title, or eventually break off and have a sequel? It's still going to be the same story continuation, so I'm leaning towards keeping this one and just letting the chapter count build. What do you think?</p><p>And eh, I thought Kabuchimaru said something about the jutsu continuing even if he died, but everyone seems to think otherwise. My bad.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 39</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death. ~ Sun Tzu</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The next day was miserably damp, with dark clouds covering the sky that threatened to drizzle rain at any moment.</p><p>It was perfect weather for a funeral.</p><p>I dressed in the heavy black cotton mourning clothes; black long sleeved shirt and black knee length skirt with black sandals. I even tied my hair with a black ribbon. It was a uniform, even more-so than the blues or flack jackets.</p><p>This one was mandatory. We were all the same in mourning.</p><p>The ceremony itself was held atop the roof of the Hokage's Tower, with the four stone faces of the Hokage staring down at us. I don't really know what I was expecting, but it was a simplistic affair.</p><p>We - the Rookie 9 - had been 'lucky' enough to be invited to the main ceremony, the memorial for the Third Hokage and all that died in the invasion. I don't know if it was because we were the most recent graduating class, or because we were all clan heirs and seconds, or because the Third had taken a liking to us. It could have been any of those reasons or all of them. Not everybody went to the main ceremony, though there were still an impressive number of shinobi there. We were arranged in military rows, two great blocks of black suited mourners that covered half the roof.</p><p>There was a square of white cloth spread out on the ground, two burning torches, and a long table, also draped in white. On the table, there were framed photographs displayed. The Third Hokage's was in pride of place in the centre, with three on either side. That <em> couldn't</em> be the total number of dead, so it was possible they were the high ranking ones - Jounin - or those that had otherwise distinguished themselves in this battle. In front of each of the photos there was a scroll with black edging - the death certificate - and a dull coloured book envelope that held either some sort of list of achievements or severance pay. There was a single incense pot in the centre of the table, though it was not lit.</p><p>All in all, it seemed very basic, even for someone as important as the Third Hokage. White was the colour of mourning as much as black was, and was supposed to drive off evil spirits. Incense to appease the good ones. I wasn't sure I <em> believed</em> in spirits, but there was a possibility, especially given how everything else seemed to work around here.</p><p>The great bells that had announced the end of battle just two days ago began tolling once again, loud peels announcing the beginning of the funeral.</p><p>"We are gathered here to remember and honour not only the Third Hokage," Homura Mitokado began, standing at the head of the lines of shinobi with the other elder, Koharu Utatane. "But all those who sacrificed themselves in this battle so our village would survive."</p><p>I stood as still and stiff as the rest of the shinobi. Grieving was done stoically here. You didn't cry or shed tears, you bore everything with a stone face. Shinobi rule twenty five wasn't just for missions or battlefield losses. It had wormed its way into the heart of society.</p><p>The only one to break the silence was Konohamaru. Undignified, maybe. Against social expectations, maybe. But he was only a child.</p><p>Iruka-sensei crouched down beside him, breaking decorum to try and comfort his student.</p><p>"It's raining," Kurenai-sensei murmured from the row behind us as rain started drizzling down. It wasn't heavy, but it was noticeable.</p><p>Asuma-sensei's voice was low and tired as he replied. "Even the heavens weep."</p><p>"… and even though we have suffered a loss, we have survived. We will <em> keep on</em> surviving. Our Will of Fire burns brightly and will continue to burn for as long as we keep fighting…"</p><p>I stared at the table with its proudly displayed photographs. The Third Hokage had died sealing the First and Second Hokage who had been brought back with the Impure World Resurrection Jutsu. Everyone had heard that story. He had summoned the Shinigami - the Death God - and forfeited his own soul in exchange.</p><p>I could not contest the presence of 'souls'. No, not that.</p><p>But… to be able to summon and <em> bind</em> a soul…</p><p>The beliefs of this place had that beyond the Impure World where we lived was the Pure World where souls resided after death.</p><p>I had never paid much attention to it because I <em> knew</em> that beyond death was reincarnation. But if that had been so… how had those souls been called back? Was it just an imprint? A memory of a soul? Had they been pulled from a new life and all those memories reawakened?</p><p>Or was the circle of reincarnation instead a spiral, with this world as the last?</p><p>Were there truly gods that judged those that died?</p><p>I shivered, feeling very cold.</p><p>What had seemed so certain, so <em> proven</em> , seemed less so the longer I looked at it.</p><p>I did not want to die, could not bear to <em> lose everything</em> ever again, but at least there had been a sense of certainty of what would happen. Fear was the domain of the unknown.</p><p>"Why do people do it? Why do they risk their lives for other people?" Naruto asked, voice hoarse, dragging my attention to him. He looked very bleak, even his normal sun bright hair washed out by the black.</p><p>"Well," Iruka-sensei said thoughtfully, his voice taking on a much softer version of his normal lecturing tone. "When someone passes away… it's the end. His past and future, all the dreams he once had… they disappear along with him. This is true even if he dies honourably in battle, as so many have. All the ties that bind him to the living are severed except for one, the most important of all. People. And these people, the ones left behind are joined together in a great circle with their shared memories of him. A circle of friendship, trust and sacrifice that grows larger and stronger as time passes. It's hard to explain it." He smiled, a little ruefully.</p><p>"So we do it because we have to. Sort of" Naruto said. "Still, I'm sad he's gone."</p><p>"Think how sad it would be if he died for nothing," Kakashi-sensei added softly. Sensei had been late, but he'd slid into the ranks with all the stealth of an ex-ANBU captain and no one had batted an eye. "But he left us something priceless. Don't worry. You'll understand one of these days."</p><p>"Hey, gimme some credit," Naruto said, a faint hint of a laugh in his voice. "That much I get."</p><p>And then the sun came out and started to shine.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Sorry. Very short chapter I know. It's the obligatory funeral scene. I spent ages trying to work out just what the hell that was on the desk in front of the photos. Thus, above is my best guess according to Japanese funeral customs. …</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Tsukiyomi Arc: Chapter 40</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: So, massive storm and equally massive power cut. Losses, two walnut trees, the hay barn and my day. Seriously, I don't know what to do with myself when I have no computer.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 40</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> No passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear. ~ Edmund Burke</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>After a few more days of clean up duty and extra patrols, we were dropped back down to regular duties, though the Jounin were still caught up in excess meetings and decisions about the village. Naruto, Sasuke and I met up for training as usual, but Sensei never made it.</p><p>There was still reconstruction being done around the village, fixing roofs and rebuilding walls, but it was the more permanent kind of reconstruction that needed skills to do and therefore couldn't just be foisted off on the nearest ninja, though there was still plenty for us to do.</p><p>"There was a messenger hawk from Sand yesterday," I informed the boys when we arrived at the training fields. "They surrendered, unconditionally."</p><p>I was, naturally, the one keeping us updated with what was actually happening. Some of the information I got from Dad, some from Ino (aka gossip) and some from covert intelligence gathering around the village (aka listening in on other peoples conversations. What? If they didn't want people to hear then they wouldn't have been talking about it in public).</p><p>"Didn't they already do that?" Naruto asked with a frown, crossing his arms. "When they left?"</p><p>"That was a retreat," Sasuke corrected, mostly patiently. "They could have just regrouped and attacked again."</p><p>I nodded. "Yeah. Apparently, the body of the Kazekage was found and he'd been killed long before the Chunin Exams. Orochimaru had been impersonating him the whole time. Hidden Sand is scrambling to recover and find someone to run the place. They don't really have any other notable shinobi and the power structure was basically 'do what the Kazekage says'. So they really just rolled over for us."</p><p>Sasuke rubbed his neck absently. "That guy… he killed both the Hokage <em> and</em> the Kazekage?"</p><p>"Yeah," I said. "I don't know how it went down, but I'm betting it was some kind of ambush. It's possible Orochimaru even set the meeting up himself, since getting a Kage out of the village unnoticed is no easy feat. Of course, that means Sand can claim that it wasn't their policies that lead them to attack us and there's no proof that they were working with him."</p><p>"What does <em> that </em> mean?" Naruto asked, baffled. At least he was trying to follow the conversation.</p><p>"It means, Sand <em> might</em> have been working with Orochimaru willingly and been betrayed, or they might have just been attacked by him and then tricked. They're claiming the later, of course, since that's best for them," I replied. "There's even been mention that since he's a missing-nin from <em> Konoha</em> it's partially our fault."</p><p>"But is it true?" Naruto asked.</p><p>I shrugged. "Impossible to tell, really."</p><p>"So what's it mean for us?" Sasuke asked thoughtfully.</p><p>"Well," I said. "Unconditional surrender is the best possible outcome, really. It means there's not going to be any more fighting, like there could have been if they'd tried to insist on stipulations. They lost a lot more than us in the fighting, and they weren't very strong to start with so it's probably the best outcome for them too. I don't know what Konoha will demand from them, since we don't have a Hokage at the moment to finalise all the details. That means," I clarified for Naruto. "that it's up to either the Elders, the Jounin Committee or the Heads of Divisions to try and hash out the treaty. Possibly even the Daimyo since he's here for the selection of the next Hokage."</p><p>"They're choosing the next Hokage?" Naruto asked quietly, eyes turning to the Hokage Mountain. It probably seemed fast to him.</p><p>"Who do you think it will be?" Sasuke asked as well.</p><p>I bit my lip. <em> Tsunade</em> . That much I remembered. But I could hardly say that. "Jiraiya-sama, probably," I said, to which Naruto yelped and protested. "He's one of the Sannin, so he's strong and well known. The other Sannin, Tsunade, hasn't been seen in years, though to be fair, this is the first I've heard of Jiraiya being around, either. Hmm. Kakashi-sensei, maybe, though he doesn't seem like he'd want the job."</p><p>Sasuke raised an eyebrow. "Really?" There was a mild tone of disbelief. Our chronically late and lazy Sensei could be in the running to be the next Hokage?</p><p>"Don't you remember what Zabuza said? About how they used to have kill on sight order for him? Kakashi-sensei is actually pretty famous," I said. "Other than that… Asuma-sensei maybe. He was one of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, so he'd have the Daimyo's ear at least." As well as being famous and being the Third's son, I mentally added. There was also Danzo, but no way was I bringing that option up. "My Dad, <em> maybe</em> , but he doesn't have that much of a combat reputation. Not compared to the others."</p><p>The Third Hokage… They had called him the God of Shinobi when he was younger. If he was, he wasn't the kind, forgiving god that his grandfatherly persona portrayed. He was Old Testament Style, burning hellfire and brimstone and the smiting of sinners. That was the kind of god shinobi would revere. The only kind they would respect.</p><p>A Kage needed to have that kind of reputation. They especially needed it after we had been weakened by attack and Hidden Cloud were just <em> waiting</em> for their chance to take advantage of it. While Sand, Rock and Mist were barely threats… Hidden Cloud had only grown stronger and they'd shown they weren't afraid to be impatient.</p><p>"That would be really weird," Naruto said, apparently still stuck on the 'Sensei as Hokage' thing.</p><p>I made a noise of affirmation.</p><p>"Speak of the devil," Sasuke muttered, as a messenger hawk flew overhead. "What does he want?"</p><p>I squinted at it, picking up the flight path and leg ribbons and translating that into information. "You, apparently." Briefly I wondered how on earth they trained the messenger birds, since it was absolutely nothing like homing pigeons. Maybe they were nin-birds.</p><p>"It was a rhetorical question," Sasuke said drolly, standing and dusting off his shorts. "I'll catch you later."</p><p>"Later," I said, waving. I dragged myself to my feet, too. "So, did you want to train?" I asked.</p><p>Naruto's stomach rumbled and he grinned sheepishly. "Ramen first? I ran into Konohamaru this morning and didn't have time to eat."</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "Lead the way," I said with a sigh. I wasn't hungry, but I could hardly deny Naruto breakfast even if he did insist on having ramen.</p><p>There was something niggling the back of my mind. The Fifth Hokage <em> had</em> been Tsunade. Assuming that that much hadn't changed, and she wasn't supposed to be in the village for some reason, that meant that someone had to go get her. That someone would probably be Jiraiya and I did vaguely remember something like that. He'd taken Naruto with him, hadn't he?</p><p>It had just been so long ago. The specifics were well and truly lost to me.</p><p>If Orochimaru had suffered the same kind of damage, or indeed any damage beyond Kabuto's ability to fix, then he would go after Tsunade as well. That seemed likely.</p><p>But there was something else…</p><p>My brow furrowed as I tried to work it out. There were no invasions beyond the first attack. There would be no dangerous missions until Naruto got back. Probably.</p><p>"Well, hey. I guess they were right. You really do eat ramen all the time," a familiar voice said, as someone ducked under the Ichiraku banner.</p><p>"Jiraiya-sama," I greeted, as Naruto spluttered around a mouth full of noodles. "How are you?"</p><p>"Busy," he replied cheerfully. "So many places to research, so little time to do it!"</p><p>"Don't talk about perverted stuff like that!" Naruto barked, nearly choking on his food. "Don't you have anything better to do?"</p><p>"Well, its funny you should ask that," Jiraiya said. "Because I'm about to go on a research trip and <em> you</em> are going to come with me." He poked a finger at Naruto, who swatted it away.</p><p>"No way! Why do I gotta go on some stupid research trip with you?" Naruto protested, annoyed.</p><p>"No, no. This isn't just a normal research trip," Jiraiya cajoled. "There's a woman I want to ask some questions, so we have to find her."</p><p>"I have no time to waste on your perverted stuff. I have to train." Naruto turned back to his noodles, effectively ignoring Jiraiya. The Sannin seemed only amused by it, so I kept out of the conversation. "I'm going to get Kakashi-sensei to teach me a lot. Like that Chidori move."</p><p>Actually, Naruto <em> had</em> asked Kakashi-sensei to teach him that. And, after a lot of prodding and whining, Kakashi-sensei had half-heartedly walked him through the steps. He couldn't <em> do</em> it, but the knowledge was there, and in theory the move was pretty straightforward. It was the 'in practice' bit that was difficult.</p><p>"I don't think you can master that move," Jiraiya said doubtfully. Which was fair enough, given that Naruto wasn't lightning natured and didn't the preternatural reflexes of the Sharingan. But <em> telling</em> him that never helped. "More importantly, the woman I was talking about is really hot. You want to see her, right?"</p><p>Naruto glowered. "Not at all. I'm not some little kid that can be convinced by a perverted hermit like you."</p><p>"Then I have no other choice. What a shame." Jiraiya sighed theatrically. "I know a technique that is more powerful than Chidori. I guess I'll have to take someone else with me. How about <em> you?</em> It's been a long time since I went on a trip with a pretty girl." He giggled.</p><p>Naruto was out of his seat in a flash, standing in front of me arms akimbo. "Don't even think about it," he barked. "You leave her alone!" Then he paused, the rest of the sentence registering. "A technique more powerful than Chidori?" he asked.</p><p>"That's right," Jiraiya agreed, leaning back. "But you didn't want to come with me, remember?"</p><p>"I changed my mind," Naruto decided. "Stay here. I gotta go pack." And he was gone, racing away to go get his gear.</p><p>I shook my head. "Hook, line and sinker." With a shinobi like Jiraiya, you were never going to win but to have it be so <em> obvious</em> was a little embarrassing.</p><p>Jiraiya chuckled. "Too easy," he agreed.</p><p>"So where <em> are</em> you off to?" I asked.</p><p>"Hmm? Oh, just to find an old friend, really. We haven't seen each other in a while." His attitude was perfectly laid back, the comment <em> just</em> the right shade of offhand. It <em> screamed</em> 'nothing important'.</p><p>"Tsunade, right?" I asked, playing my hunch. "And the question would be 'would you like a new hat'?"</p><p>He chuckled. "They always say never play cards with a Nara. Well. Any ninja really." He scratched his chin thoughtfully, as though pondering that piece of wisdom. It wasn't a 'yes', but more importantly, it wasn't a 'no'.</p><p>Okay, so Jiraiya and Naruto were going after Tsunade. But that still left a nagging feeling that I was missing something. I drummed my fingers on the table, beside my half eaten ramen, absently.</p><p>It was either Naruto or Sasuke. The <em> world</em> didn't revolve around them, no. It was a <em> world</em> with all that entailed. But everything I knew about it from Before did. The story had been about Naruto, about Sasuke, not about great political ramifications, not about mysteries or life, the universe and everything. It had been about a boy.</p><p><em> Why take Naruto with him anyway?</em></p><p>"Is Naruto… is he safe?" I asked, haltingly.</p><p>There was a <em> flicker</em> , something tiny that chased across Jiraiya's face. Almost too small to notice, and certainly too small to understand, but it was something. "Why wouldn't he be?" he replied with a jovial, booming laugh. "What a question!"</p><p>"Why wouldn't he be?" I echoed, looking away. Madara. Pein's group - whatever their name had been. But that had all been post time-skip, hadn't it? Unless…</p><p>Itachi was such a huge part of Sasuke's story that he <em> had</em> to have shown up at least once.</p><p>I hoped not. I really, really hoped not. This wasn't a story, not any more.</p><p>I had a sinking feeling that I was hoping in vain.</p><p>It was natural that memories faded. I had tried to hold on to the ones that were important, but they had been fading before I'd realised where I was - what I needed to keep. I didn't trust myself to write them down, not coded, not any how. Codes could be broken. And that would leave me in a lot of trouble with information that I shouldn't have had.</p><p>"So how are you going to find her, anyhow? If she's been off the map this long, I doubt it's going to be easy," I said, trying to get my mind off the possible outcome. Trying to use 'future knowledge' was so imprecise as to be nearly impossible, even without the extra difficulty of fading memories. How long between this event and that? Which order had these happened in? What caused that?</p><p>It was better to just gather as much information about the present as possible, the same as every other ninja did.</p><p>Jiraiya sighed. "Oh, alright. Yes, we're looking for Tsunade. And it wont be easy, you're right about that. She might be retired, but she knows how to hide. But Tsunade has one great, honking weakness."</p><p>I looked at him curiously.</p><p>"She <em> loves</em> to gamble." He chuckled. "It's almost compulsive. You can guarantee, wherever she is right now… there's a gambling hall."</p><p>"Follow the money, huh?" I murmured. It was one of the basic tenets of ninja investigations. Because most of the time, money meant a paper trail, even if it was fake.</p><p>"That's right. I figure, we'll start in Otafuku-Gai and work our way around depending on what we hear. Don't you go spreading that around now," he cautioned. His tone might have been light, but his eyes were serious.</p><p>I shook my head. "I won't."</p><p>Naruto should be, <em> would be</em> , safe with Jiraiya. It sucked to be so small and weak and have to depend on others to protect you, but it was what it was. We couldn't stand up to those levels of power, not yet. Trusting others to protect us for now was the only way we were going to <em> get</em> strong enough.</p><p>"So how are your seals coming along, huh?" Jiraiya asked.</p><p>I gracefully allowed the subject change, not about to pass up the chance to pick his brain on the topic of his mastery. There were so many seals that I wanted to create that were currently beyond my limits. Chakra stores to increase my reserves. Something to block the Sharingan, the Rinnegan. To block summons. To negate Time-Space techniques like that intangibility thing Madara had going. All well beyond my current limits, but if I started now maybe…</p><p>I waved Naruto and Jiraiya goodbye as they left, but the whole thing left me feeling unsettled.</p><p><em> Naruto will be safe with Jiraiya.</em> <em> He </em> will<em> be.</em></p><p>Jiraiya, for all his tomfoolery, was a legendary ninja for a reason. He had survived two Great Wars. He was S-ranked. He had over forty years experience as a ninja.</p><p>He wasn't someone you took on lightly.</p><p>Who was I kidding? I was as worried as hell.</p><p>I went back to the training field in the hope that Sasuke might have been there, but he wasn't. I ran myself through some kata, the familiar repetitions calming and distracting. I liked kata, the flow of one movement into another, the imaginary opponents that got beat down again and again, the stretch and burn of using fighting moves without the adrenaline spike of an actual fight.</p><p>I would probably never be a Taijutsu master, but it wasn't a skill I cared to neglect. Too many mid to long rangers died because the enemy got too close. And sometimes, you really just wanted to hit things.</p><p>It was about three when Sasuke came flying into the clearing, completely agitated. He slid to a stop, kicking up dust and dirt at the sudden deceleration. He'd been running at full speed, which was sort of frowned upon within Konoha proper.</p><p>"Where's Naruto?" he demanded.</p><p>"Sasuke? What-?"</p><p>"Itachi's here. He's after Naruto. We have to warn him. Where is he?" Sasuke bit out rapidly, each phrase like a bullet.</p><p>The meaning took a second to sink in. <em> No.</em></p><p>"Itachi-! We have to get Kakashi-sensei!" We didn't stand a chance.</p><p>Sasuke looked like he wanted to shake me. "He's already attacked Kakashi. That's how I found out."</p><p>"The other sensei then," I floundered. "Gai-sensei-"</p><p>He did shake me this time, hands clenching on my shoulders. "They know! They know and they aren't doing anything! Either tell me or I'll find someone else who will!" He was actually shouting. It was so un-Sasuke like.</p><p>I swallowed. Sasuke was going to go regardless of what I did. <em> Shit, shit, shit.</em> "He's with Jiraiya-sama. They were headed for Otafuku-Gai."</p><p>Relief flashed across his face as he dropped me and dashed away. I blinked for half a second before I cursed, released my Weight Seal and ran after him.</p><p>"Sasuke," I said as I pulled up alongside him. "We don't stand a <em> chance</em> against him…"</p><p>"I know!" he snapped tersely. "We're not going to fight. We just have to warn Naruto."</p><p><em> Damn, damn, damnit all. </em> We couldn't match an S-rank ninja for speed. But Naruto and Jiraiya wouldn't be moving quickly.</p><p>My fingers tunnelled into my weapons pouch, seeking out the small folds at the back. On another desperate race through the forests, I'd stashed soldier pills in there. I wasn't carrying my missions scroll today, but I still had those.</p><p>"Here," I said, passing one to him.</p><p>Sasuke glanced at it, then did a double take. He'd clearly been training, since his chakra level was low. "Thanks," he murmured, biting into it.</p><p>We poured on the speed.</p><p><em> Damnit all.</em> I'd just thought about Itachi <em> this morning.</em> I should have… I should have planned something or <em> known</em> or … or…</p><p><em> Focus,</em> I snapped at myself. <em> Mission now; Pity party later.</em></p><p>I couldn't stop Sasuke. Not without attacking him and knocking him out and he would <em> never forgive me.</em> No matter how it worked out, he would <em> never </em> trust me again. I knew that much about Sasuke.</p><p>We couldn't take on Itachi. That much was obvious and I was grateful that Sasuke appeared to realise it too. I wasn't entirely sure it would hold up if we ran into the man himself, but at least he <em> knew.</em></p><p>If you can't stop and can't go back, the only choice is to go on. The only option was to get to Jiraiya. To pass on the warning before they got there and attacked. Regardless of whether Jiraiya needed the warning or not, it was all <em> we</em> could do.</p><p>We bleed chakra for speed, pushing on at a punishing pace. It was a level of speed we couldn't have held long, but Otafuku-Gai wasn't that far away.</p><p>We hit the village at a run, screeching to a stop in the middle of the crowded road. There was some kind of festival on here, crowding the place with civilian level chakra signals.</p><p>"Where?" Sasuke panted, eyes darting around.</p><p>"I'm trying!" I snapped, casting my senses out for the bright sunshine of Naruto's chakra or the placid calm of Jiraiya's. "They aren't together!" I felt like cursing, like pulling my hair out. "I'll go for Naruto. Jiraiya is in that direction, somewhere. I can't get a lock on him." It was lucky I could sense him at all, frankly. "Tall, white haired, red haori. His forehead protector has the kanji for 'oil' on it. Find him. I'll get Naruto."</p><p>Sasuke wavered. "You know who he is. You'll have better luck finding him."</p><p>"Itachi will know who you are, Sasuke! If you go for Naruto -" I cut myself off. "I'm an unknown. Go! We're wasting time!"</p><p>I darted away, homing in on Naruto before he could protest. Damn, I was being far too snippy with him. But we were both strung out with worry and fear. <em> Stupid, stupid, stupid…</em></p><p>I pulled my chakra in close, hiding it like it was the middle of the night and I was terrified of the monsters in my sleep. It wasn't midnight but I <em> was</em> terrified and the monsters were <em> real.</em></p><p>I found the right hotel, and dashed up the stairs past the bewildered receptionist who didn't even have time to protest. Locating the right room was a little harder, but the place wasn't exactly a maze.</p><p>"Naruto!" I shouted, banging on the locked door. I could have broken it, but we weren't that pressed, yet.</p><p>He opened it, looking puzzled. "Shikako? Why are you here? Did something happen?"</p><p>"Yes," I said. "Where's Jiraiya?" Hoping against hope that he would actually know.</p><p>He blinked, face morphing into a disgusted look. "Out there. He found some <em> lady.</em> " He 'harrumph'ed. "Left me here all alone."</p><p>I cast a glance down the hallway, out the window there. <em> Wait or go?</em> I couldn't sense any other ninja, but I didn't kid myself into thinking that I'd be able to sense Itachi if he was truly trying to hide.</p><p>Would we be safer inside or out?</p><p>"Listen. Itachi Uchiha is after you," I said. "You need to stick with Jiraiya. He's already hurt Kakashi-sensei."</p><p>"W-what?" Naruto stammered. "Kakashi-sensei is hurt? How?"</p><p>"I don't know," I said anxiously. "Look. Sasuke is out there looking for Jiraiya. We <em> really</em> need to get you to him."</p><p>Sasuke's chakra was zigzagging through the streets, desperate and hurried.</p><p><em> Stay or go? Stayorgo?</em></p><p>"Let's get outside, there's more space there," I said. Usually I liked enclosed spaces. It made me feel safe to be able to put my back to something solid. But right now all I felt was trapped. "Through the window." I nudged him back into the room.</p><p>If they were watching the front entrance, they might not see us leave through the window. "Remember Kakashi-sensei's escape and evasion lessons?" I asked.</p><p>Naruto glanced at me, at once confused and perceptive. "You're really scared."</p><p>"Yes." I didn't even try and deny it. "Let's go."</p><p>"I'll leave a clone," he decided. "If he expects me to be here…" Another Naruto popped into existence and flopped on the bed, while the real Naruto wiggled out the window.</p><p>"Good idea," I praised. It was good thinking. Something <em> I</em> should have thought of. I was letting my fear get to me.</p><p>The window was to the side of the building, and overlooked a small alleyway. We scampered up the side of the building, leaping agilely across the gap and onto the opposite rooftop. We kept low, crouching and slinking and trying not to draw attention. Given that there was no <em> obvious</em> threat, it would have felt silly except for the feeling of looming doom. Naruto must have felt it too, or at least felt like humouring me, because he was being <em> quiet.</em></p><p>We headed in the general direction of Jiraiya and Sasuke. We crossed rooftops, dropping soundlessly to the ground in an alleyway, ready to blend into the mass of people on the road. For a ninja, other people were the best disguise.</p><p>For a moment, I really thought it was going to work.</p><p>Then, with a flicker of speed so fast I didn't even register it, a pair of feet was blocking our way. Slowly, resigned to what I knew I'd see, I looked up. Beside me, Naruto froze.</p><p>"Hello, Naruto."</p><p><em> Well, fuck.</em></p><p>Sometimes I wished I knew better curse words.</p><p><hr /></p><p>So I'm not entirely happy with this chapter - isn't that always the case? - but here it is anyway.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Tsukiyomi Arc: Chapter 41</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: You know, Itachi is one of my favourite characters. But he is <em> difficult</em> to write. So many layers. Like an ogre. XD</p><p>And I've started a second fic called Sunshine Sidestories… which is what it says on the tin. It wont be updated much and you don't <em> need</em> to read them to get what's going on here but eh, you might want to. Who knows?</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 41</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The pain of the mind is worse than the pain of the body ~ Publilius Syrus</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I flared my chakra high in a signal of panic. It would bring Sasuke running like a beacon - which I didn't want - but hopefully it would also bring Jiraiya.</p><p><em> Hopefully.</em></p><p>There was someone behind us, trapping us in the alley, and I forced Naruto behind me, standing us back to back. I kept my eyes on Itachi's neckline, the simple three looped necklace that he wore. It was too high, too close to those deadly Sharingan eyes, but I wasn't skilled enough to be able to ignore his arms.</p><p>Not that it would matter, in the end.</p><p>We didn't stand a chance.</p><p>On the other hand… we weren't dead yet.</p><p>I had no doubt that Itachi could have killed us before we'd even been aware that he was there. The fact that he hadn't…</p><p>Well. It was like Zabuza all over again, wasn't it?</p><p>He wanted something. But the thing he wanted wasn't what he said he wanted. Wasn't the outcome he seemed to be trying to achieve.</p><p>That wasn't <em> that</em> unique among ninja.</p><p>I knew the truth about the massacre. That Itachi had done it on orders. That he was a pacifist - if a ninja could be so.</p><p>That didn't change the fact that he was the type of person <em> who had killed his family on orders.</em></p><p>If he thought it was necessary, if he thought it would protect Sasuke, motivate him, to maintain his cover, whatever, he would kill us. He might not want to, might regret it, but he would do it. Mercilessly.</p><p>He was still so very dangerous.</p><p>"Naruto. You're coming with us." It wasn't threatening or commanding. Itachi didn't need to be. He just said it softly, like a statement of undeniable fact.</p><p>No one moved.</p><p><em> Stall. Come on, Naruto, you're good at this! Get them talking!</em></p><p>The wind blew.</p><p>"What do you want with Naruto?" I asked, swallowing and trying to sound non-confrontational. It was late afternoon, so there was a decent amount of shade in the alleyway, but I doubted I would be able to hold Kisame even if I could catch him. His chakra was like a tsunami, looming overhead and threatening to crash down on us and crush us beneath it. Itachi… I wouldn't be able to catch at all.</p><p>"Our mission is to capture the Nine Tailed Fox," Itachi replied, perfectly smoothly. I was surprised he even answered.</p><p>"For what purpose?" He had to know I was stalling. Was he going to play the game?</p><p>"I cannot tell you that."</p><p>I swallowed again, abandoning that line of questioning. "Just the Kyuubi?" I asked, knowing perfectly well they were after all the Jinchuriki. It was risky to ask, it might make them decide I knew <em> too</em> much, might raise suspicions. Might, might, might…</p><p>There might have been the barest hint of a smile on Itachi's lips. "Clever. You are correct, we are also after the other Bijuu."</p><p><em> Keep stalling!</em></p><p>I could feel my heart racing, the slide of sweat across my forehead. There was the murmur of voices from the festival just meters away. We were so close, yet separated in a completely different world. The seconds ticked by agonisingly slowly.</p><p>"We? Are there more of you?" This was an informational goldmine. I hoped that Naruto was listening. He was steady against my back, but silent. I didn't dare take my eyes off of Itachi to check on him.</p><p>Behind me, Kisame shuffled, the sound of rustling cloth. "Come on, Itachi. There's no need to play nice with her."</p><p>"To be able to deduce so much from so little," Itachi mused.</p><p>"Yeah, well," I said, stumbling over the words. "You're wearing a uniform. That implies an organisation."</p><p>"You are correct," he said. "Have you ever heard of the Akatsuki?"</p><p>"<em> Akatsuki</em> ," I echoed. "The red dawn." The red clouds on their cloaks… it fit. "If you're a member, I'm surprised that everyone doesn't know that name."</p><p>It was flattery, but also the cold hard truth. An organisation of S-ranked missing-nin should have been infamous. The fact that they weren't… was a little terrifying.</p><p>"In time," Itachi said. "In time they will."</p><p>I swallowed again, compulsively. That certainly sounded <em> ominous. </em></p><p><em> Where are you, Jiraiya?</em></p><p>But it wasn't Jiraiya that came.</p><p>It was Sasuke.</p><p>He stood at the mouth of the alleyway, staring at Itachi. When he spoke, his voice was thick with anger and hatred. "Itachi."</p><p><em> No. You should have kept looking for Jiraiya,</em> I thought with despair.</p><p>Itachi didn't move, didn't turn around. "Sasuke. It's been a long time."</p><p>"Well, that's interesting," Kisame said. "He has the Sharingan as well. Who is he, Itachi?" I wondered if he truly didn't know, or if he was just forcing Itachi to say it.</p><p>"My younger brother." There was no emotion in the statement. None at all.</p><p>"That's strange. Because the way I heard it, the whole Uchiha clan was wiped out." There was a drawn out pause. "By you."</p><p>Naruto gasped. Sasuke <em> growled</em> .</p><p>All I could hear was his voice saying <em> "I lost everything once. I don't ever want to have to say that again. My trusted comrades falling, right in front of me…"</em></p><p>I knew he was going to do something stupid.</p><p>There wasn't anything <em> left</em> to do but stupid actions.</p><p>"I hope you're ready to die. It's just as you said. I fostered my hatred for you all this time. I lived my life for one single purpose. <em> To see you die. </em> It ends here." Sasuke snarled and leapt forward <em> dragging </em> the Chidori along the side of the building, the friction with the concrete helping to build up the charge and power.</p><p>I lashed out with my shadow, forwards and backwards, hoping to snare at least one of them. It was a futile hope, but Sasuke had initiated the fight and I couldn't do <em> nothing.</em> Behind me, Naruto was flaring chakra, clones popping into existence and being extinguished.</p><p>"Sorry, kid," I could hear Kisame say, just as Naruto's chakra cut off and I felt an extreme drain through my shadow. I killed the tendril reflexively, before it could drain me completely. It just happened so <em> fast.</em> "My blade, Samehada, cuts through chakra and <em> devours</em> it."</p><p>Sasuke darted forward, Chidori thrust out. There wasn't much space for a run up but it wouldn't have mattered anyway. Itachi pivoted neatly, moving around my darting shadow, grabbing Sasuke's arm by the wrist and twisting. The Chidori imploded into the wall with a deafening boom.</p><p>Out in the street, people started screaming.</p><p>Sasuke twisted, tried to use Itachi's grip as leverage to kick him.</p><p>There was an awful crack. Sasuke gasped a broken scream, stumbling back clutching his arm.</p><p>"Foolish little brother," Itachi tsked.</p><p>I hurled kunai, desperate to do <em> something</em> to help. Itachi avoided them all without even looking. He was so close to Sasuke that I couldn't use exploding tags without getting my team mate too.</p><p>"You're still too weak," Itachi said conversationally, throwing Sasuke to the ground with a brutal kick. "You don't have enough hate. And you know something? <em> You never will</em> ."</p><p>Sasuke screamed defiance, hurling himself back to his feet and at Itachi. There was no strategy anymore, no plans, just suicidal fury.</p><p>Itachi lashed out, efficient and brutal. A sweep of the leg knocked Sasuke off balance, a punch to the solar plexus left him retching and gasping, a pale hand curled around his throat and pinned him to the wall.</p><p>I knew, with sudden, blinding clarity what would come next.</p><p>There wasn't time to think. Only the split second <em> now</em> of combat. My fingers made the seals. My chakra surged.</p><p><em> Replacement!</em></p><p>Then I was staring into Itachi Uchiha's wide, Magenkyo eyes. Tugging, pulling, sucking me in…</p><p>I screamed.</p><p>I half expected it to be sharp and tearing, the clawing of crows feet maybe, but Itachi's chakra slid through my system like hot oil, slick and black and impossible to grasp. I flailed, trying to grab it and disperse it, but every move I made only spread it, only smeared it further, flushing my system with bitter and tainted chakra. My eyes burned, the site of the onslaught and it was still coming and I was <em> drowning in it…</em></p><p>Then I could see, <em> had to see</em> , the wrong, wrong, wrong red sky with it's black clouds and the buildings that were white on black and too sharp and overexposed to be real. My eyes ached from the excess clarity and I tried to shut them, tried to block it out but I couldn't, <em> I couldn't</em> , because it wasn't my eyes…</p><p>This wasn't the kind of genjutsu that tried to fool you into thinking it was real. If that was a subtle knife of agony, this was a sledgehammer of torture.</p><p><em> In the world of Tsukiyomi, time and space are mine to command…</em></p><p>The world wavered, and I was in a dojo. There were two people kneeling on the ground. And Itachi was there, geared in ANBU armour, sword held ready.</p><p>"No. Oh, no," I whimpered, trying to spin away. But the world moved with me, turning around me like I was the sun. I ran, but the ground didn't move under my feet and I covered my eyes, my ears, but it didn't work because this <em> wasn't </em> coming through my eyes, it was being piped straight into my brain and I <em> couldn't look away…</em></p><p><em> To test the limits of my ability…</em></p><p>The world moved. I struggled in the grip of this madness, chakra flaring and pushing and <em> trying</em> , but it was smothered, covered in oil and drowning like a poor, bedraggled seabird in an oil slick.</p><p>Person by person, he showed me the massacre of the Uchiha clan.</p><p>I didn't know these people and I wanted to be sick. Was screaming and crying and trying <em> everything</em> I could to escape. I bit my lip, clawed fingers across my wrists, tried jutsu, tried seals, anything, anything I could think of.</p><p>Nothing worked.</p><p>What would it have been like for Sasuke? To see this, these people he <em> knew</em> , had loved and lived with, to see them cut down like this? This had been <em> intended</em> for him.</p><p>There were over three hundred people in the Uchiha clan. Ninja. Civilians. Elderly. Children. Babies.</p><p>All dead. All brutally murdered.</p><p>I fought futilely; weak, exhausted struggles. I gasped for breath, broken shuddering sobs.</p><p><em> If you wish to kill me, despise me. Foster your hatred. By all means, flee. Cling to your wretched life…</em></p><p>Then.</p><p>The world wavered, and I was in a dojo. There were two people kneeling on the ground. And Itachi was there, geared in ANBU armour, sword held ready.</p><p><em> Seventy one hours, fifty nine minutes and fifty nine seconds left…</em></p><p>"Oh, god, no."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Tsukiyomi Arc: Chapter 42</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: The meaning of life, the universe and everything: 42</p><p>About Tsukiyomi: Given the repetitive nature of it, it's my theory that Tsukiyomi is very much pre-recorded. Itachi set the scene, hit the target with it and walked away. He's not actually <em> in</em> there with them. Which is why the genjutsu was still set up for Sasuke and it couldn't get cancelled after he hit the wrong person. Make sense?</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 42</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The snow of yesterday </em></p><p><em> that fell like cherry petals </em></p><p><em> is water once again. </em></p><p><em> ~Gozan</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I blinked awake slowly, every thought and movement sluggish. My head felt clouded, stuffed full of cotton wool that nothing quite managed to penetrate.</p><p>There was white in front of me. Squares of it, all stacked together. I stared at it for a while, uncomprehending. The visual input was there, it just wasn't <em> clicking.</em></p><p>A lady leant forward, blonde hair and dark golden eyes. She looked familiar in a distant way, not someone I knew but maybe someone whose picture I had seen before.</p><p>I blinked. The white shuttered out, the woman vanishing, as darkness took over, then was back just as quickly. How odd.</p><p>But there was something important about that.</p><p>Visual input. Light stimulating rods and cones on the back of the retina which send nerve impulses through the optic tract … light blocked from entering the eyes by the lowering of the eyelids…</p><p><em> But the genjutsu isn't transmitted through my eyes…</em></p><p>I hadn't been able to block it out by closing my eyes, it had been much more direct than that. Impossible to ignore.</p><p>I pondered that for a while, feeling like I was on the edge of something important. Something obvious. The fog was slowly clearing away and my brain <em> hurt</em> like a migraine or a bruise, which was wrong because the brain didn't have nociceptors. The cavity lining the cranium did, of course, but still, this was an ache that I felt everywhere inside my head, everything stressed and strained and overworked.</p><p>"<em> Baa-chan? Why isn't she waking up?"</em></p><p>My chakra hurt too which was a little more worrying. That didn't have nociceptors either. Using chakra could hurt sometimes, particularly if the body was injured, but I <em> wasn't</em> using it, it was simply there. And hurting.</p><p><em> Hurting… causing pain or in pain?</em></p><p>Because Itachi initiating the genjutsu had <em> hurt.</em> Had felt like drowning and boiling and suffocating. And that was chakra.</p><p>I blinked again, slowly. White, dark, white.</p><p>There was no sudden change. No red sky. No reverse black and white buildings. No movement. No death.</p><p>Itachi had not attempted to fool me. It had just been repetition after repetition of the exact same scenario. Again and again and again. <em> (On and on into infinity foreverandeverandever)</em></p><p>It took a while for the thought to sink in. It took even longer for the conclusion to form.</p><p>If this was not Tsukiyomi, and Itachi had not changed it's state… then what I was seeing was not genjutsu. I was awake<em> .</em></p><p>Someone sighed. "She might not wake up. Your sensei has his Sharingan to protect him, at least a bit, but she has no such advantages. Against injuries like this there is only so much even <em> I</em> can do."</p><p>"But-" Naruto protested.</p><p><em> Naruto!</em></p><p>I was <em> awake</em> .</p><p>I bolted upright.</p><p>"<em> Naruto! Sasuke!"</em> I tried to shout. Nothing came out. Tentatively, I raised a hand to my throat.</p><p>Strong hands caught my shoulders, stopping my movement. "Or she might be fine," she said, amused. "Calm down. You screamed yourself raw, you know. They coated your voice box with chakra to protect it."</p><p>I heard the words, understood and could even feel the chakra that she mentioned, but it wasn't important.</p><p><em> Team?</em> I signed insistently. The fight <em> had not been over </em> when I had fallen. The boys…</p><p>She smirked, eyes crinkling easily. One long finger touched my cheek and pushed. My head tilted, turning sideways.</p><p><hr /></p><p>There was Naruto. A little dirty, a little worried, but unhurt with the biggest, stupidest grin on his face. That tight little knot of worry eased, just a bit.</p><p>"Oh, sweetheart," Mum breathed, from my other side, voice strangely quiet. "You're awake."</p><p>I turned. <em> Quiet</em> was not a normal reaction from my mother. She was sitting beside the desk - covered in flowers and cards and gifts - looking like she had been there for quite some time. The non-standard issue chair with the jacket draped over the back, the half read book, the bag on the floor… they told a story too. I realised, with a pang of guilt, that she had probably been sitting here every day for however long it took Naruto and Tsunade to return. She had sat there and watched me and I had failed to wake.</p><p>She had come to terms with it. The angry worry that led to her shouting at us so often, to the bossiness and pushiness, had faded away to resignation. I had no doubt people had gotten an ear full earlier, but right now there was only the joy of an event so unexpected as to be a miracle.</p><p>She hugged me tightly, and I felt wet tears dripping onto my shoulder.</p><p>"Come on, Baa-chan," I heard Naruto mutter. "You've still got other people to heal, you know."</p><p>I wanted to talk to him, to thank him and assure him that I was fine, and maybe ask how Sasuke was and what was going on, but there was something so fundamentally reassuring about being held by <em> Mummy</em> that I didn't want to let go.</p><p>Whether I was twelve, whether I was an <em> adult</em> in my own right… I felt like a child.</p><p>"Don't you ever do that again, you hear?" Mum choked out. "What on earth were you <em> thinking, </em> you silly girl?"</p><p>I couldn't have answered her even if I'd wanted to.</p><p>Dad and Shika came by not too much later. It seemed that Naruto really <em> had</em> dragged Tsunade straight to the hospital, instead of letting her sign in and whatever else a newly returned Hokage to be had to do, much to the annoyance of most of the administrators. By Dad's telling, the Elders were particularly unimpressed.</p><p>He didn't sound very bothered by that statement.</p><p>He looked tired and drawn. Really drawn. But there was a relieved smile touching his lips, that mirrored the one Mum was still wearing.</p><p>Shikamaru snorted, hands deep in his pockets. "It's about time you woke up. Mum's been making me do all your chores." The complaint was so <em> Shikamaru </em> that I smiled. There was deep relief in his eyes, but there was no need to say all the other things that were twisting through his mind. <em> You're awake. I'm glad.</em> <em> We were worried.</em> That was all that needed to be said.</p><p>"It's good for you," Dad said, resting a hand on his shoulder. "Builds character."</p><p>"That's not what you say when she's on <em> your</em> case," Shikamaru grumbled, but subsided because Mum was <em> right there.</em></p><p>"Oh, hush, you two," she said. "Don't you start that."</p><p>We weren't a particularly demonstrative family but we were all here and it was <em> so obvious</em> to all of us that we loved each other.</p><p>And that was enough.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Later, when it started getting dark and the nurses began to make clucking noises every time they came into the room, they eventually had to go. I hugged everyone goodbye and waved them off with a smile… then dropped back to the bed feeling strangely exhausted. I was tired, the kind of tired that feels like emptiness but I wasn't sleepy. It was an obnoxious state to be in, I discovered, as I lay there.</p><p>Someone had helpfully installed a clock on the wall and it's ticking <em> irritated</em> me.</p><p>Tick.</p><p>Tick.</p><p>Tick.</p><p><em> Three hours, forty nine minutes and twelve seconds to go…</em></p><p>I scowled at the ceiling.</p><p><em> That's just not going to work, is it?</em></p><p>I didn't <em> regret</em> taking Sasuke's place. Whatever I was going through, it would be a thousand times worse for him. But I did wish, quietly, that neither of us had had to go through it. Maybe if I hadn't told him where… but then Naruto… but Itachi clearly wasn't trying…</p><p>I couldn't guess what would have happened. I hadn't been able to before we went, and I wasn't able to now.</p><p>You couldn't change the past, but being able to identify your mistakes helped you stop making them. Maybe if we hadn't tried to sneak away and just run for it, spammed clones, done <em> something </em> else…</p><p><em> I don't want to think about this,</em> I thought, casting my mind around for something to distract me. I swept my chakra sense out, 'watching' the people wandering around the hospital for a while. That one was Lee, and there was Sakura - still helping out? - and, oh, there was Kakashi-sensei. Of course, he would still be here too.</p><p>I swung my feet over the edge of the bed and tapped them thoughtfully on the ground. For someone who had been in a coma for the last month, I seemed to have retained a fair amount of muscle tone. Did the medic nin have some kind of jutsu that stimulated the muscles? Did my chakra do it? It was something to look into.</p><p>I stood carefully, just in case my assessment had been wrong, but I didn't immediately topple over and collapse, so it just left me feeling a little silly standing around like it was a big deal. I shrugged the feeling off with odd humour.</p><p><em> And lo, then the great ninja warrior sets forth towards the far and distant door, accompanied by her trusty IV pole …</em></p><p>I even tried to hum a little only to find that that didn't work either.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei's room wasn't far away, but I didn't hurry since the whole point was to be <em> doing</em> something and walking counted.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei was sitting up, talking in a low voice to Gai-sensei when I knocked softly on the door. He looked <em> tired</em> , his usual slouch more of a slump, with one eye barely open at all. There was just something <em> defeated</em> looking about him.</p><p><em> Hi</em> , I signed tentatively, hoping I hadn't interrupted anything.</p><p>"Shikako?" Sensei asked baffled. "What happened to you?"</p><p>Oh. I hadn't considered that Sensei wouldn't <em> know. </em> He'd been awake all afternoon, the same as I had. Then again, I hadn't been caught up on very much that had happened over the past month, either, and I didn't know how long Gai-sensei had been here. He had gone to see Lee, after all.</p><p>I saw Gai-sensei wince. "Ah, My Eternal Rival, I was just about to tell you…"</p><p><em> Not hurt,</em> I signed cheerfully. Well, I wasn't, anymore. I was awake. I was <em> fine. </em> Honestly.</p><p>"And your silence is a protest against unfair hospital conditions?" he said dubiously.</p><p>I shrugged and dragged my IV pole in closer so I could hug him. He patted me awkwardly on the shoulder which is probably the best result any of us had got out of him yet. Gai-sensei was occupying the rooms only chair, so I scooted myself onto the bed next to Sensei.</p><p>"Hey, this is my hospital bed. Get your own," Kakashi-sensei protested half-heartedly.</p><p>I blinked at him with as much faux innocence as I could. He huffed in amusement, before casting a look at Gai-sensei that clearly said 'explain. Now.'</p><p>It was much more lively than he'd been when I opened the door, though he could have just been faking it for my benefit.</p><p>Gai-sensei sighed, and when he spoke, his voice was serious. "Shortly after I arrived at the scene, Itachi and Kisame fled. You were right in your assumption that they were after Naruto, it seems, because they headed after Jiraiya." He took a deep breath and sighed. "Sasuke Uchiha came looking for you and overheard information to that effect."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei closed his eye.</p><p>"At first we believed that letting him calm down on his own would be of greater benefit. Unfortunately," there was a note of grim humour in his voice. "Your <em> other</em> student knew how to locate Naruto and the two of them left the village post haste. I received notification on your behalf from the gate guards and went after them."</p><p>"And they ran into Itachi," Kakashi-sensei finished heavily, looking at me.</p><p>I wobbled my hand back and forth in a '<em> not quite' </em> movement.</p><p>"They managed to locate Naruto, by all accounts. He had been separated from Jiraiya, and they were attempting to find him. <em> Then</em> they ran into Itachi." It was funny how so much could be conveyed by such a small sentence. "It's amazing that they got away with as few injuries as they did."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei looked at me, a serious one over, trying to find signs of injury. "Tell me."</p><p>Gai-sensei hesitated. I nodded encouragingly. "Sasuke had a broken arm, several broken ribs and mild contusions. Naruto was unharmed. Shikako… as far as we could tell, she was hit with the same technique you were."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei <em> flinched.</em></p><p>I patted his hand, reassuringly. <em> Not hurt,</em> I signed again. It was awful, yes, horrifying, traumatising, viscous and brutal, but apart from the feeling of invading chakra, there had been no pain. I had an inclination that Itachi had not been nearly so … kind to Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>"And your voice?" he asked.</p><p>I touched my throat. I could feel the chakra coating it, not actually in my cells just lining the surface. They hadn't taken it off, so it was probably supposed to remain there but it didn't seem to be doing anything. <em> Healing, </em> I signed.</p><p>He gave me a dubious look.</p><p>I patted his hand again. <em> Okay,</em> I insisted.</p><p>I don't think he bought it, which was fair enough. <em> I</em> didn't buy it.</p><p>"Sasuke will be relieved to hear that you are both awake," Gai-sensei said, breaking the awkward silence. "He has been working with Neji and Tenten and while they are all individually competent, their team work leaves much to be desired."</p><p>I could see that, actually, especially if Sasuke wasn't in the mood to make an <em> attempt.</em> Individually, Team Gai was much more specialised than we were and likely had rigid roles for who did what. Team 7 was far more jack-of-all trades and whoever did whatever. I didn't know Tenten very well, but even if Neji had started to change, I expect he and Sasuke butted heads. A lot.</p><p>I sank back and listened to the chatter.</p><p>Yeah. This was better than my silent room.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I don't think I slept, exactly, but I likely zoned out because there was a distinct feeling of coming back to myself when I sensed another chakra signature. Gai-sensei was gone, and the room was quiet.</p><p>"Hey, kiddo," Jiraiya said, jumping down from the windowsill ledge. "And it looks like you've got a limpet with you."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei shifted. "Jiraiya. What brings you here?"</p><p>"Just checking up on you. I didn't expect them to be moving so fast. I would have warned you, if I knew."</p><p>I sharpened to attention. <em> Warning?</em> I signed.</p><p>Jiraiya's eyes flickered. "It's a bit late for any sort of warning now," he said, and chuckled. It was a clear deflection.</p><p>How frustrating. I wanted - <em> needed</em> - to talk to Jiraiya. Sign language was good, but it had been designed for field work and holding full conversations was difficult. Added to that, it was much easier to ignore.</p><p>I reached up, touched my throat, destabilised the chakra and released the jutsu. Oh. <em> Ow.</em></p><p>"You're… talking about Akatsuki, aren't you?" I rasped. And, oh. My voice sounded <em> ruined</em> , wrecked, like a pack a day smoker. It could have been from damage, or from not being used for so long or both. I hoped it wasn't permanent.</p><p>There was a quick snap of unspoken conversation - Jiraiya glancing at Sensei <em> did you</em> , the denial - that I was surprised to even be able to pick up on.</p><p>"How do you know that name?" Jiraiya asked, faux casually, leaning on the wall.</p><p>"Itachi told me," I responded. "Didn't Naruto tell you what he said?"</p><p>Jiraiya snorted. "That's brat… Wouldn't remember his own head if it wasn't so loud." He shook his head, half exasperation half drama. That didn't necessarily mean Naruto <em> hadn't</em> told him. "What else did the Uchiha say?"</p><p><em> In the world of Tsukiyomi, time and space are mine to command…</em></p><p>I blinked it away, focusing on the important information. "That he belonged to an organisation called Akatsuki. That they were there after the Kyuubi and they're after the other Bijuu as well…" I faltered. Was that really all that I had gained? It had seemed so much <em> more… </em> "There are more of them, not just him and Kisame… he called it a 'mission' like a proper…" Like a ninja village, like there was someone giving <em> orders</em> .</p><p>"He specifically said they're after the Bijuu?" Kakashi-sensei asked, then glanced at Jiraiya. Confirmation for something they had merely suspected?</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Jiraiya scratched his chin. "Hmm. Awful chatty of him. Still, that works in our favour."</p><p>Did Jiraiya know Itachi's truth? He was an intelligence expert, he might have. At the very least, he probably had suspicions.</p><p>"You… know more about them, don't you?" I rasped.</p><p>"That's not something you want to get yourself messed up in, kid," Jiraiya said. "Don't worry about it, okay?"</p><p>"I already am," I pointed out.</p><p>"You've just had an abject lesson in how <em> out of your league</em> you are. You should be jumping at the chance to get to safety."</p><p>I shrugged, uncomfortable at the reminder. It was so very, very true. "Naruto is my team mate. If they come after him again, I'm going to <em> be there</em> . It involves us."</p><p>'<em> I'm going to be there', </em> literally<em> ,</em> because we would go on the same missions and '<em> I'm going to be there'</em> because he was my friend and I wouldn't abandon him.</p><p>"Look at your sensei there. At your age, he was already a Jounin. And he went down just as fast as you did. There are very, very few people who can stand up against that level of enemy." Jiraiya's voice was serious, a direct contrast from his usual joking manner.</p><p>Sensei's hands clenched on the sheets, but he didn't offer any comment.</p><p>Something about Jiraiya's rant struck me. "You're going to take Naruto away."</p><p>He blinked, caught off guard. Yes, I <em> knew</em> he was going to. Time-skip. That much was… so obvious. I just… hadn't considered that… Oh.</p><p>"Yes," he said guardedly. "Not right now, but soon."</p><p>"You'll take him away, because you're the only one that can protect him," I ploughed on. "But you're also going to be teaching him how to fight back, aren't you? How to match up against opponents of that level. And eventually… you'll bring him back. So we'll learn too. We're his <em> team.</em> "</p><p>I might not have had the <em> right</em> to speak for all of us, but I did it anyway. Sasuke would learn because of Itachi and I would learn because I knew what was coming and Kakashi-sensei would because he was a survivor.</p><p>"He also has advantages you don't," Jiraiya pointed out. "Look. It's great that you want to help your team mate. It really is. I bet your sensei is proud of you. But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing you can do."</p><p>"I know," I said. "<em> I know. </em> I know we're too young, too weak. I know we have to rely on you to-" to protect us, to save us. "I <em> know.</em> But we can learn, can get stronger, can…" I faltered. "At least we'd know when to run."</p><p>I stared at him, frustrated, tears pricking my eyes because he was <em> right</em> and we were in over our heads here and <em> he wasn't going to tell me anything-</em></p><p>I bit them back because I wasn't going to cry. I wasn't. It didn't matter if he didn't tell me anything. I knew <em> some</em> things. I could find out the rest. It would take <em> a lot</em> of digging, but I could do it.</p><p>Jiraiya sighed. He was looking at Kakashi-sensei, not at me.</p><p>"Save me from Genin with no self preservation," he sighed. "Alright, alright. You're going to be disappointed though, because what Itachi handed you is close to our sum total knowledge."</p><p>"You said Orochimaru used to be part of the organisation," Kakashi-sensei said.</p><p>"Yeah," Jiraiya said grimly. "Which is close to the only reason I know about them at all."</p><p><em> In time you will.</em></p><p>"I asked him that," I rasped. "Why we didn't know about them if it was people like him. He said we would, in time."</p><p>"Well, that doesn't sound good," Kakashi-sensei muttered.</p><p>"No. There are nine shinobi involved, as far as I can tell. All S-rank. So far they've been keeping pretty quiet, gathering information, keeping to the shadows, the kind of thing. There's Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki, obviously. Orochimaru left a while ago but there were some murmurings he'd been sighted with Sasori of the Red Sand. One of them is a bounty hunter, since we've been getting a lot of reports from the bounty offices. That's really about all we know."</p><p>I blinked. I doubted he had told me <em> everything</em> but still. That was all?</p><p>He chuckled. "Told ya, kid."</p><p><em> Pein, Konan, Itachi, Kisame, Kakuzu, Hidan, Sasori, Deidara, Zetsu, Tobi…</em></p><p>I still remembered all the names. Now I just had to link them to Akatsuki. Looked like I would be doing research anyway.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Tsukiyomi Arc: Chapter 43</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Rating has been bumped up to T. A few people have mentioned it, so better safe than sorry, I guess.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 43</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> It is not so much our friends' help that helps us as the confident knowledge that they will help us. ~ Epicurus </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I had barely finished eating breakfast the next morning - <em> hospital food, not the greatest cuisine ever invented</em> - when Sasuke barrelled into my room.</p><p>There was an agitation to his movements, an 'is it true?', and I was glad that I <em> was</em> awake. I wasn't entirely sure what his reaction would have been if I'd slept late this morning.</p><p>"Good morning," I said lightly, blinking at him. My voice was still a little rougher than it used to be but, though the medic nin had frowned at my removal of the block, they had healed the damage. Medical chakra felt strange, and though I knew it was helpful, I still had to focus to <em> not</em> shut it out.</p><p>He swallowed. "I… only just heard. Gai-sensei told me you were awake."</p><p>When they met up, for training or missions or whatever Gai-sensei got the three of them together for, I guessed. Sasuke did look a bit battered, like he had already been training today.</p><p>"I woke up yesterday," I said.</p><p>Sasuke replied with a wordless 'ah' moving to stand by the window instead of taking a seat. He folded his arms across his chest, the movement seeming defensive.</p><p><em> Not good.</em></p><p>I'd expected that Sasuke would have had a hard time. I'd expected it. But this looked to be worse than I'd thought.</p><p>"You've been training with Gai-sensei?" I asked, prodding for conversation. It seemed like a safe topic.</p><p>He nodded, jerkily. "He offered, while…" He cleared his throat. "They needed a third man for their squad while Lee was in the hospital." He sounded utterly professional. Easier to say that one of <em> their</em> team mates was in the hospital than his own were gone.</p><p>I 'hmm'ed. "Any interesting missions?"</p><p>"Just some border patrol. Rock has been scouting out the northern border. There have been a couple of attacks."</p><p>"Rock? Not Cloud? Interesting," I mused. Rock did despise us, quite a lot, but they were hardly at peak strength themselves. Like Sand, they hardly had the manpower to attack us. Then again…</p><p>Sasuke shrugged. "I haven't heard of any. So, soon, probably." He smirked a little, at the small joke.</p><p><em> If it hasn't happened yet, it's probably about to.</em> One of the unofficial laws of ninja life, right up there with Murphy's.</p><p>I smiled back.</p><p>The moment of levity didn't last long. The smirk faded and Sasuke turned to stare out the window instead of looking at me. The line of his shoulders was tense.</p><p>I stared at him worriedly. How to bring this up? What should I say?</p><p>It turned out that I didn't have to, because Sasuke broke the ice a minute later. "I'm sorry."</p><p>"I- what?" I blinked in surprised. That… wasn't what I expected at all.</p><p>"I'm sorry," he repeated. "I- that's <em> twice</em> you've gotten hurt pulling me out of danger. It <em> shouldn't</em> <em> have happened.</em> I should be better than this."</p><p>"No, no, Sasuke. It's not your fault," I said, hastily, reassuring him. I slid out of bed and moved over to him. The guilt, I'd almost expected that. But the sheer <em> misery</em> in his eyes threw me. "Its okay."</p><p>"It's not okay!" he snapped. He was shaking. "Don't say that. I heard you. You were screaming like… like…. They knocked you out and you <em> still kept screaming.</em> Don't even try to tell me it's okay."</p><p>I … hadn't known that. A wry smile touched my lips.</p><p>"It's still not your fault."</p><p>He sneered. "Oh, so you were saving someone else from getting attacked?"</p><p>"I used the jutsu," I said firmly, not letting myself waver in face of his anger. He wasn't angry at <em> me.</em> "I used the jutsu and I <em> don't regret it.</em> " I emphasised that as much as I could. "And you know what? I'd do it again. Because it would have been worse to watch you go through that. I would willingly put myself between you and danger, no matter what."</p><p>"You shouldn't," he said tiredly, anger fading. His shoulder slumped. "You'll get hurt."</p><p>"So could you," I replied. "You went to warn Naruto because you couldn't stand him getting hurt and I went with you because I couldn't stand <em> either</em> of you getting hurt."</p><p>He flexed his hands. "I don't want either of you to get hurt either. I was trying to help Naruto and you got hurt. It wasn't… it wasn't meant to be like that."</p><p><em> It wasn't a fair trade. </em></p><p><em> Everything I do turns to ash.</em></p><p>"I know," I said as gently as I could.</p><p>"Next time… I'll go alone. Then you wont get hurt." He sounded so earnest, like this was the perfect solution.</p><p>"We're not going to just let you push us away, Sasuke," I said.</p><p>There was relief and despair warring on his face. "He's just going to come back," he said. "I have to kill him. Or he's just going to keep coming <em> back</em> ."</p><p><em> And destroying everything I have</em> went unsaid. Knowing Itachi was after Naruto in his own right might have softened some of the blow, but it couldn't stop it completely. Itachi was Sasuke's nightmare in the same way that the Kyuubi was mine. Worse maybe, since I had never had to face Kyuubi, I didn't matter to it, it had never <em> touched</em> me.</p><p>His fists were clenched helplessly. "I'm just not strong enough."</p><p>I slipped my arms around his waist. "We'll train," I promised. "And we'll be ready next time." Not for a long while yet, but sometime.</p><p>I didn't really expect him to hug me back but he did, with a fierceness that was a little surprising. That alone would have told me how badly he was taking this all.</p><p>If I thought that I had been clingy in Wave Country when Sasuke had been injured, it really had nothing on Sasuke's overprotective tendencies. I'd had a glimpse of that in the Second Exam but it must have slipped my mind, because I was surprised by it all over again.</p><p>Still, I'd been in a coma for a month. People were allowed to be worried. I could deal.</p><p>That didn't mean I wasn't relieved when Naruto showed up.</p><p>"Hey Shikako! Oh, whoa. Sasuke? You're here?" His voice climbed a few decibels in aggravation. "I've been looking everywhere for you!"</p><p>Sasuke looked like he was on the verge of smirking in amusement. "Hn."</p><p>Naruto scoffed. "That is not even cool."</p><p>"Hey, Naruto," I said. "You vanished pretty quick yesterday. Didn't even give me a hug." I pouted exaggeratedly and opened my arms. Hey, I'd given everyone else a hug.</p><p>Naruto stepped forward so I could reach him. "Hehe, sorry. But Baa-chan still had to look at Lee and you were with your Mum so…" he trailed off.</p><p>Yeah, I could see his point. Being with my family had been <em> nice</em> .</p><p>"Thank you," I said, and meant it.</p><p>Like a lot of things, Naruto didn't seem to know how to handle gratitude. "Ah, it's okay," he said awkwardly, scratching the back of his head before flopping down into the chair. "So you're, like, better now, right?" he asked anxiously.</p><p>I nodded. "I'm fine," I said easily. I had a feeling I was going to get a lot of practice saying that. "So, I guess I missed out on a lot, right? Why don't you guys tell me what happened after I was knocked out?"</p><p>"Jiraiya showed up," Sasuke said concisely. "Those two fled. Then Gai-sensei brought us back to Konoha."</p><p>Naruto nodded. "Yeah, the pervy sage…" he shivered. "It was pretty scary. You just kept screaming the whole time; we didn't know what he'd done to you. The pervy sage looked really angry when he showed up. I thought there was going to be a huge fight or something, but they just took one look at him and ran. Then Bushy Brows-sensei showed up but he was too late to help."</p><p>There was a joke there about spending too much time with Kakashi-sensei. I took the high ground and didn't voice it.</p><p>"I see," I said. "So then you went and found Tsunade?"</p><p>"Yeah." Naruto brightened. "Yeah. And pervy sage did end up teaching me that jutsu that he said he would, you know, the one he said was 'better than Chidori'?" he bounced in his seat. "It totally is. I'll show you… I mean later, when you're not in the hospital or anything. It's awesome."</p><p>"Yeah, right," Sasuke muttered. "Better than Chidori." His scoff was only a shadow of its former self.</p><p>"It is so," Naruto said, indignant. "It's the Fourth Hokage's jutsu, so there." Childishly he stuck out his tongue.</p><p>"Settle down, settle down," I said, amused. "We can all show off our super cool jutsu later. Why don't you tell us about the rest of the trip. I bet <em> some</em> interesting things had to have happened."</p><p>Naruto subsided for a second, before launching into the tale of just how his trip with Jiraiya had gone. Apparently, I hadn't been too far off the mark with my assumption that Orochimaru would also be searching for Tsunade and both he and Kabuto had been there. That was a shame. I had half held out hope that Kabuto would have been caught or killed during the invasion. He certainly hadn't seemed to be doing too well against Gai-sensei when I left.</p><p>"He offered to revive her brother?" Sasuke asked quietly, staring out the window.</p><p>Naruto shrugged uncomfortably. "Something like that, yeah. I think it was the same jutsu he used against the old man. It's not… It's not the same as <em> actually</em> bringing them back." His tone was awkward. "She told him to stuff it because they wouldn't have wanted to be used against Konoha like that. Baa-chan is pretty cool for an old lady, you know?"</p><p>"If he brought them back, he could probably control them," I added, thoughtfully. "It would be pretty awful it he used them to attack."</p><p>Naruto shivered. "Yeah. That'd be… awful," he agreed.</p><p>Of course, the fact that Naruto had challenged her to a fight was another sticking point.</p><p>"Well you don't lack for courage," I said, sharing a glance with Sasuke.</p><p>"Just brains," he added.</p><p>"Yea- hey!" Naruto yelped. "I wasn't going to let her get away with that. And besides," he pointed out, eyes glinting. "It worked."</p><p>He might not have won the fight, exactly, but Tsunade had become the Fifth Hokage and returned to Konoha, so it might have been a case of lost the battle, won the war.</p><p>"So it did," I mused. "So it did."</p><p>They stayed for a while, but neither of the boys were exactly the type for long hospital visits. They just weren't made for it. I didn't hold it against them.</p><p>"Err, Sasuke…" I muttered, just as Naruto left.</p><p>Sasuke paused at the door. "Yeah?"</p><p>I hopped out of bed and found the clock that I'd taken off the wall, shoved in the closet and smothered with spare linens. "Could you hand this in to the reception, or something?"</p><p>Sasuke blinked.</p><p>"The ticking just <em> bothers </em> me," I said, aware that it wasn't a very good explanation. It was only when the room was silent that it mattered, when I had nothing else to focus on but the constant ticking. This <em> was not</em> my first step to becoming Sensei.</p><p>Sasuke, bless his heart, took the clock and said nothing.</p><p>I spent a few minutes checking over the flowers and cards. There were quite a few of them, from my family, friends, the rest of rookie nine, from various Akimichi and Yamanaka and even one from Iruka-sensei. There was also a stack of basic medical books beside the table that I hadn't noticed before. I had no idea whose they were, or why they were here but I pinched one to read. My room, my rules.</p><p>The mystery was laid to rest when Ino came bustling in, hands full of snapdragons. "Hello, sleeping beauty," she sang cheerfully.</p><p>"Morning, Ino," I replied with a smile.</p><p>"It's quiet in here, I figured you'd be swamped in visitors," she commented, arranging the flowers on the desk in some mystical arrangement that suited her sensibilities. My ikebana skills were very basic.</p><p>"The boys were in here this morning, they've already come and gone. The family was here all yesterday, so they're excused. Sakura is probably either working or in lessons. Hmm. Chouji probably wont show till after lunch. Am I missing anyone?"</p><p>"Hinata usually stops by every couple of days," Ino said, surprising me a little. "She brings her team sometimes." It shouldn't have surprised me, of course, since I had visited Hinata semi-frequently and she seemed the type to remember that. I did consider myself friends with Kiba, but like Naruto and Sasuke he wasn't the type for hospital visits.</p><p>"That's nice of her," I said absently.</p><p>Ino nodded. "So Sasuke was here? How was he?"</p><p>I nearly teased her, until I saw her worried frown. "Better, I think," I murmured. "We talked. I don't know, I'll have to see if it sunk in."</p><p>"I hope so," she said. "He's been working himself into the ground. Every spare moment, just training. I think Gai-sensei made them take so many missions because it forced him to take a break."</p><p>"You've really been looking out for him, haven't you?" I asked, studying her. "Thanks, Ino."</p><p>"It's never a hassle to spend time with Sasuke," she said brightly, then wilted a little under my continued stare. She shrugged. "We've been getting along better. He even said 'thanks' for helping out against Gaara." She laughed a little, but it was more wry than amused. "A few months ago, I'd have been ecstatic. I still was, a little but… no one knew if you were ever going to wake up."</p><p>I nodded. "I know, Ino. I'm sorry. But even if I didn't… it would have been okay, y'know, for you to be happy…"</p><p>She smiled. "Oh, don't start with that. I've been doing more than just moping about you know." She scooped one of the medical books up and showed it to me. "I guess I'm going to have to find another place to study. That's a shame; it's usually pretty quiet in here."</p><p>"I didn't think you were that interested in medical jutsu," I said. "You never said anything."</p><p>"What?" she asked defensively. "You think that I'm just going to let you and Sakura do this without me? No way. Ino Yamanaka does not lose to <em> anybody</em> at <em> anything.</em> "</p><p>And maybe not, but she'd still picked the time I was laid up in hospital to start. It was the first time any of us had been in serious 'might never recover' danger. The first dawning realisation that 'this is dangerous' and 'we might die'. Dangerous fights were one thing. Injuries were another.</p><p>I smiled and shook my head. "Whatever you say, Ino."</p><p>She huffed. "I do say."</p><p>"Maybe we should get a study group together," I suggested. "You, me, Sakura. Hinata does herbal salves, I know…"</p><p>"Sounds like a good idea," she said. "Funny how it's just us girls, though."</p><p>"Well, Shikamaru knows more than he'd be willing to admit," I said. "And I bet Kiba's been wrangled into helping at the Inuzuka clinic a few times. But no, I don't think any of the boys are that interested."</p><p>"That's just like that lazy toad," she said. "He made some mumbling about how girls should be good at it when I said I was learning."</p><p>I snickered. "One day he's going to learn how to phrase things in a way that <em> isn't</em> insulting."</p><p>"Oh, please. He does it on purpose and you know it. Chivalry, my ass." But she looked mostly amused.</p><p>We chattered back and forth, sometimes exchanging gossip - or rather, Ino filling me in on what I'd missed - and just sometimes silent and reading, until about eleven when the door slid open.</p><p>I watched in bemusement as Sakura peered around the doorframe, checking the room out before she came in.</p><p>"Looking for someone?" I asked.</p><p>She blushed. "Lee's been in here a lot," she confessed, voice hushed like someone might overhear. "Whenever I try to visit…"</p><p>"Lee?" I repeated, blinking. I had visited him a few times, sure, but we weren't exactly <em> close.</em></p><p>She looked miserable. "I think he's stalking me."</p><p>Ino snickered, hand over her mouth trying to keep silent.</p><p>I couldn't stop the smile that kicked up the corner of my lip, but I hastily squashed it before she saw. "Lee is… very enthusiastic," I said diplomatically.</p><p>She gave me a horrified look. "He keeps asking me out on dates! He's worse than <em> Naruto</em> . At least I don't see him very much anymore."</p><p>"Hey, no dissing my team mates," I said, wiggling my finger at her.</p><p>She looked abashed. "Sorry, sorry. But still, it's the truth."</p><p>Ino managed to straighten her face, though it seemed to take a lot of effort. "Ah, Lee's not so bad. If it wasn't for the eyebrows…"</p><p>Sakura shivered, then gave her a reproachful look. "You wouldn't find it so funny if he was after you."</p><p>"I wouldn't, of course… you beautiful flower of springtime." Ino wheezed, cackling with laughter.</p><p>Sakura glowered. I felt like I was missing part of the joke, but I could guess.</p><p>"<em> Anyway</em> ," Sakura said heavily. "Speaking of Lee, have you heard about the surgery?"</p><p>I shook my head. "Surgery?"</p><p>"Mmm," she pulled the chair over and sat down. "Tsunade-sama looked at him. She said that she could fix whatever was wrong with him - I don't have the details - but that the surgery had only a 50% chance of success."</p><p>Ino stopped laughed. "Oh, ouch."</p><p>"Yeah. I mean, there's no way that anyone would go through with that, right?"</p><p>I considered. "If it's his only chance… yeah, I think he would."</p><p>"What?" Sakura gasped.</p><p>"It's got to be pretty serious if he's still in hospital after a whole month," I said. "And if Tsunade herself has to look at him. Stands to reason then that his shinobi career would be over if he didn't take it."</p><p>"But… it's only … he could <em> die.</em> "</p><p>"He did seem pretty determined to be a shinobi," Ino said slowly. "I mean, he could have forfeited the match, and he never did. Should have, probably."</p><p>"That's crazy," Sakura whispered, looking a little shaken.</p><p>"Hey, medical treatments aren't <em> pure</em> chance, you know," I said, trying to reassure her. "They might say fifty percent, but you're stacking the deck in your favour simply by having Tsunade here. And you can't underestimate the healing factor of sheer willpower."</p><p>Sakura smiled weakly. "I guess."</p><p>Ino closed her book with finality. "Right. Well, Sakura and I usually meet up for lunch," she said.</p><p>I got the hint. "Don't let me keep you," I said, waving. "Go. Eat."</p><p>They both sent me smiles. "Don't worry. A few days and you'll be out of here," Ino said. "Then we'll all get lunch together."</p><p>"I'm looking forward to it."</p><p>I expected to be fed hospital food again for lunch, but it was barely twenty minutes later that Chouji arrived, carrying possibly the biggest basket of food that I'd ever seen. Shika followed behind him with a slightly smaller but still impressive basket.</p><p>"Are you expecting an army?" I asked, amused, even as I crossed my legs and flattened the bed sheets out so we could turn my bed into a picnic table. I wasn't on a restricted diet like I would be if my gastrointestinal tract hadn't been in use, and I totally didn't want to think about how I'd been fed while I was out of it. I was very thankful all such tubing had been removed before I'd been woken.</p><p>"Mum cooked," Chouji said, a little sheepishly. "She thought that you'd need some energy after sleeping for so long."</p><p>"This wasn't even all of it," Shika complained. "Just what we could carry."</p><p>"I'm sorry you had to go to so much effort," I consoled, patting him on the shoulder.</p><p>He snorted. "Itadakimasu."</p><p>I echoed him, eating with pleasure. Setsuko Akimichi was a wonderful cook and even though there was a ridiculous amount of food, Chouji was making a damn good attempt to get through it all.</p><p>After lunch, we all lounged around in various states of 'ooh, I ate too much'. Shikamaru set up a shogi board after a while and he and I traded pieces back and forth.</p><p>"So?" I asked.</p><p>"So?" he drawled back lazily.</p><p>"You're not going to fill me in on what you've been up to this month?" I asked archly.</p><p>He shrugged. "Same as what normally happens." He yawned. "Training, missions, Mum hassling me…"</p><p>I rolled my eyes, but considered him. He was focusing on the shogi game which, well, it wasn't our best game in ever.</p><p>"Talk to Sasuke much?" I asked, taking a stab in the dark.</p><p>"A bit," he said casually. "It's been hard to pin him down."</p><p>Okay, that settled it. "You've spent the last month interrogating him for details, haven't you?" I asked.</p><p>Chouji laughed. "I told you she'd know," he said to Shikamaru.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah. Whatever."</p><p>I sighed. I had a feeling I knew where this was going. "Shika…"</p><p>"Relax," he said, voice still sounding bored. "I haven't been giving him a hard time about it. Even though he was the one to drag you out there, it wasn't really his fault. I know that." But there was a deep and strangely calculating look in his eyes, because he knew <em> exactly</em> whose fault it was.</p><p>"I know. I'm just saying… If you're planning to take down Itachi…" I began.</p><p>He stiffened. Yeah, that was <em> exactly </em> what he was planning, wasn't it?</p><p>"You better start planning long term, got it?" I finished.</p><p>He relaxed, just a fraction. "Troublesome."</p><p>I snorted weakly. "You're troublesome. He's an S-rank that <em> other</em> S-ranks avoid. I know you're a tactical genius and all, but that doesn't guarantee anything."</p><p>"I know," he said.</p><p>"And you better include <em> me</em> in whatever you're planning. And Sasuke and Naruto are going to want to be involved." They would not stand to be left out, Sasuke especially. And well, Naruto… "Hey. If you're going to use my team mates as bait, at least do them the decency of telling them."</p><p>"I wasn't-" he protested, then paused. "Bait is a harsh way of putting it."</p><p><em> But true.</em></p><p>"And not until we're sure of victory. Don't go all hot headed on me," I cautioned.</p><p>"Me? Hot headed?" He snorted. "Maybe I should get the doctor. You've clearly damaged something."</p><p>"You don't fool me," I scoffed. "It might take a lot to get to you, but you're not going to let this go."</p><p>He shrugged, but didn't deny it.</p><p><em> Oi vey. </em> And like Jiraiya had said, <em> save me from Genin with no sense of self preservation. </em></p><p>Irony, you work quickly.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Search and Rescue Arc: Chapter 44</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Okay, so I found this fantastic essay on Tsunade on the net. It's called Before Hokage and After; A Tsunade Analysis and makes some excellent points. Hence the Tsunade love. XD</p><p>And just something that I was pondering: its generally accepted that Kakashi activated his Mangekyo with residual guilt over Obito… but it's entirely possible he actually fulfilled the requirements. I know they say 'best friend' but the line between friends and best friend is pretty thin. There are a few ways, an old comrade turned missing nin; friendship with ninja from another nation that ended on the battlefield; even deliberately going undercover, making friends, then killing them. Admittedly, it seems far more <em> Kakashi</em> to hold onto undeserved guilt for ages…</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 44</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it's all over. ~Gloria Naylor </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I was released from hospital in time for the inauguration of the Fifth Hokage. The streets were packed as we watched Tsunade, standing tall and strong with the vibrant red of the Hokage's hat on her head, being sworn in.</p><p>"And from this day on, I shall protect the Hidden Leaf Village as the Fifth Hokage!" She finished, sweeping the hat from her head dramatically.</p><p>We cheered.</p><p>There was very much a sense of moving on, of starting anew and beginning again in the air.</p><p>Tsunade is a legend in Konoha, more so than either of her team mates. Oh, the Sanin were considered the peak of combat ability and strength as a shinobi but we had a lot of them - the White Fang, the Yellow Flash, the First Hokage - heck, the Third's father, Sasuke Sarutobi was a legend from <em> before</em> ninja villages existed.</p><p>Tsunade, though. She changed things.</p><p>Konoha is the only village with an entire medical sector and it is entirely due to her. She was possibly the first person to <em> ever </em> be worried about the safety and well being of both ninja and civilians; the first person to treat them like people and not tools. She championed the inclusion of medics on ninja teams, not just in the hospital for when - and if - they returned. Although it wasn't implemented during the Second Great Shinobi War when she proposed it, it was during the Third, and some people regard it as the sole reason we survived. Her system for detecting and countering poisons is considered to be the reason that we were victorious in the Second Great Shinobi War.</p><p>The Konoha we know today… is almost entirely her creation.</p><p>She was the people's champion, if there was such a thing.</p><p>But for all that, from the point of view of a Kunoichi, there is one technique that we practically revere her for. A contraceptive and hormone suppressant. Using progesterone and estrogen, the technique prevents follicles in the ovum from developing. It goes further than that, and more effectively than any contraceptive I remember from Before, completely removes menstrual cycles. Not only did she invent it, but instead of calling it a day and keeping it to herself, she refined it until every single Academy aged Kunoichi could use it. It was constant; we learnt to apply it in the Academy and it would last until we decided to remove it to start a family. It made field missions easier and safer. When there are enemy ninja that can smell a drop of blood from a kilometre away, menstruation was one of the most dangerous things that could happen to a kunoichi. Not only that, but no cramps, no headaches, no need for specialised supplies. No risk of unwanted pregnancy.</p><p>Her lineage was only half the reason we called Tsunade 'Princess'.</p><p>No one protested her promotion to Hokage. Didn't mention that she'd left the village, that she was a renowned gambler and drunk.</p><p>Not that things like that <em> mattered</em> , in the end. This was a ninja village.</p><p>It seemed a little weird to me, to put someone in charge who had such obvious, unrepentant flaws, but at the same time it was straightforward and reassuring.</p><p>It was interesting how we'd all grouped into our teams as we stood here, and no one seemed to notice. It was just so natural.</p><p>"Now, that's a historic event," I murmured.</p><p>"The start of a new era," Kakashi-sensei agreed. His voice was a little subdued though, and out of all of us, Kakashi-sensei was the only one who would have seen the coronation of a Hokage before.</p><p>"We should celebrate," I suggested. Not just about the Fifth Hokage, but the fact that we were all together again.</p><p>"Ichiraku?" Naruto perked up.</p><p>And it was just so Naruto that I laughed.</p><p>The next few days, Sensei and I were still officially on 'medical leave' to give us time to retrain. The boys came and went, apparently being slotted into other teams for missions. To hear him tell it, none of Naruto's missions ever went<em> smoothly.</em></p><p>I fully intended on training, as well as a whole other list of things, but first there was something I needed to do.</p><p>I went to the Archives and signed into the Registry.</p><p>The Archive Library is built into the Hokage Mountain. They say that there's files on every ninja in the village in here, past and present, as well as pretty much every piece of secret information ever gathered. I wouldn't know, as a Genin my clearance level is too low to access any of that stuff.</p><p>But I only needed low clearance, anyway.</p><p>Because we're a ninja village, Konoha keeps a pretty strict eye on who lives inside the village. That does translate to a pretty unholy amount of paper work and census taking and so forth, but it also means there's a complete list of Konoha citizens. Birth certificates, death certificates… they're filed and <em> kept</em> because that's how you prove your identity.</p><p>Which meant they were in the Archives.</p><p>I made a beeline for the death certificates. Funnily enough, I didn't know the exact date of the massacre, only the year and maybe the month. That didn't matter, though, because all I had to look for was the huge stack of Uchiha names.</p><p>I pulled out the stack of certificates, carried them to one of the worktables at the side of room, and began arranging them in an unholy jigsaw.</p><p><em> Now, who died first?</em></p><p>The quality of the certificates varied. They all had names and dates of birth and death of course. Some had occupations. Some, mostly the ninja, had photos attached.</p><p>The causes of death didn't help as much as they should have. Some were the same as what Itachi had shown me and some… weren't. That meant two things, either he'd shown me the wrong things on purpose because a) it made him look better or more terrifying b) it made a bigger impact on Sasuke that way c) there was something there he was hiding d) the details were fuzzy after so long or … he hadn't done it on purpose. He'd done it because he <em> hadn't known. </em></p><p>Which made sense. There had been many gifted shinobi in the Uchiha clan, and at the end of the day, Itachi had been one man. One thirteen year old boy.</p><p>Regardless, that really wasn't why I was here. Memories from a genjutsu attack was no proof at all.</p><p>It took a long time and a lot of guess work. I was only maybe half done when someone interrupted me.</p><p>"New hobby?" Dad asked, sliding into the seat across the table.</p><p>I blinked at him, jolted from my working trance. "Huh?"</p><p>He gestured at the papers spread out over the table.</p><p>I ran a hand through my hair, distracted. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>Dad gave me an amused look. "You've been in here all afternoon. I got a message from one of the overseers asking if I knew what you were doing."</p><p>I blinked again, this time in actual confusion. On the surface it sounded fine but why would anyone be bothered about what a mere Genin was doing in the low level Archives? Even to either find out who I was and who my parents were, or worse, bother the Jounin Commander?</p><p>Then it clicked. I had just had a run in with Uchiha Itachi. I was now looking at files about the Uchiha Massacre. There were secrets here that people wanted kept. Dad had either been informed, or intercepted a message.</p><p>I was really, ridiculously lucky that my Dad was who he was.</p><p>And also. I was <em> really stupid.</em></p><p>I swallowed. "I just… I felt like I should know their names," I said distantly. "He was aiming for Sasuke, to show him…" I gestured at the files. "To show him how his family died."</p><p>I hadn't told anyone what I'd seen. No one had asked. Unless they had some way of telling what a genjutsu was showing, they couldn't have known.</p><p>"Even though they're already dead, it was still like… still like I was there. Seeing it. I thought, maybe, if I knew their names it would be…" I struggled for a word. "Better."</p><p>Not better. Nothing would really make it <em> better.</em> Easier to deal with maybe. Easier to compartmentalise. To mourn or <em> something</em> …</p><p>"I just… I feel like I should know their names." I shrugged. It felt inadequate.</p><p>Dad's face was carefully calm. I couldn't tell what he was thinking. It was very rare when I <em> could</em> .</p><p>"I see," he said, humming. "Do you need help?"</p><p>My shoulders sagged, tension escaping. No judgement or recrimination or even questions about what had happened. Just… <em> do you need help?</em></p><p>"I only know what they look like," I admitted. "But not all these have photos."</p><p>Dad considered, finger tapping his chin for a second, before rising and fetching what looked like a heavy leather-bound book. "This might help," he said, opening it to the back.</p><p>I took it gingerly. It looked rather like a yearbook, with grids of small photos. It was pretty much <em> exactly</em> what I needed. "Yeah," I said. "Thank you."</p><p><hr /></p><p>There were a lot of things I <em> wanted</em> to do. Practice my jutsu. Make sure my taijutsu was up to scratch. Research the Akatsuki. Get the set time on my explosive seal down so it was actually combat applicable. Possibly name the damn thing, since names helped with focusing.</p><p>I managed some. Naruto and Sasuke were more than willing to spar - when they were around - and Shikamaru would with only <em> half</em> the usual amount of prodding. Dad started up my clan training again and I found I was leaps and bounds behind Shikamaru, who was nearly capable of using Shadow Stitching Jutsu.</p><p>Not that I was going to rush to catch up. Been there. Learnt <em> that</em> lesson.</p><p>It made me feel a little left behind, particularly when Naruto showed off his Rasengan and Sasuke proved that a month of frantic, don't-care-if-I-hurt-myself training could move you along tremendously - as long as there was someone around to make sure you didn't <em> actually</em> hurt yourself.</p><p>A month was both a very short time and a very long time. I felt a little out of step, trying to catch up with everything that had happened while I had been out of it.</p><p>I wanted to research Akatsuki, but in order of priority making sure I was fit to fight was much more important. I did crack out the books every night though.</p><p>I could have just started with the bingo book. I was pretty sure I knew who was involved. But explaining how I knew that, proving it… I couldn't do it. But I had another avenue to pursue.</p><p>Akatsuki had been around <em> before</em> it became an organisation of megalomaniacs. I was a little fuzzy on the details, but I knew that. Jiraiya's trio of orphans had formed it during the war, until they had been betrayed by Danzo and Hanzo.</p><p>So. An organisation of ninja, during the war. Important or visible enough to bother Hanzo the Salamander himself. There <em> had</em> to be a mention of them. All I needed was a single throwaway line. The name. That was it. That would link them to the Land of Rain.</p><p>Easier said than done, of course. But I was hopeful.</p><p>Our leave didn't last for very long. All too soon Team 7 was arrayed before the Mission Assignment Desk.</p><p>"If I could give you more time off, I would," Tsunade said, looking at us. "Unfortunately, we're pushed for ninja at the moment. You're all physically healthy so you should have no problems." She paused for a second, as if seeing if we would protest. "That said, I <em> can</em> ease you back into things. Here's a C-rank. Search and Rescue. Should be an easy mission."</p><p>"Easy mission?" Naruto almost shouted in protest. "Ah, come on! I can totally -" he paused. Looked at me. Looked at Sensei. Then nodded solemnly and tucked his hands behind his head. "Oh. I get it. Sure. No problem."</p><p>Tsunade's lips twitched. "I'm glad," she said.</p><p>Considering she had basically explained her reasoning…</p><p>"You can count on us, Baa-chan," he continued.</p><p>"Don't call me that!" she snapped, mood turning irritated in a heartbeat. She biffed the mission scroll at his head. "Go on, get out of here!"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei grabbed the scroll with one hand and Naruto's collar with the other, effectively dragging him out of the room before he could make things worse. Sasuke and I exchanged amused looks and followed.</p><p>"Alright," Kakashi-sensei said, unrolling the scroll once we were outside. "Go grab your mission gear and meet me at the gate ASAP. This one is time critical."</p><p>Which made sense, if it was a search and rescue. The longer you took, the less chance of finding them alive.</p><p>"Yes, Sensei," we chorused, darting off to do just that.</p><p>We met up at the gate in due haste and were well on our way when Kakashi-sensei started the briefing. It wasn't uncommon to do this on the run, since tree hopping was close to second nature for us.</p><p>"We're looking for a missing person," Kakashi-sensei started, flicking a photo over to us. "Genmai of Inaho Village. He vanished into the hills around the village yesterday morning. When he didn't come back overnight, they sent a messenger bird to us."</p><p>That was a much faster way of contacting Konoha than sending a civilian to the village. There was probably a ninja outpost nearby somewhere that had birds, or the village was a reasonably large and well connected one.</p><p>"There have been reports of bandits in the area," Kakashi-sensei continued. "So it might even be an abduction, though if that's the case there hasn't been any ransom demands made yet."</p><p>"Are there any more details on him?" I asked curiously. "Is he an important figure? And why was he in the hills?"</p><p>"Mm. He's the manager of the lumber mill, apparently," Kakashi-sensei said. "He was looking for a new location for wood, or something like that. Presumably, he's familiar with the area, which is why his disappearance is suspicious, but if it is bandits, it's more likely to be a crime of opportunity than a selected target."</p><p>There was little more detail than that. We stopped by the village, a small but reasonably wealthy looking place, and met Genmai's family. We ran through the usual missing person questions; when did you last see him, where was he, where did he intend to go, did he say when he'd be back, was he acting oddly, and so forth. It didn't garner us any more information than we already had, apart from the location of the lumber mill.</p><p>That was our next destination, and we took in the bustling building and rushing river.</p><p><em> Dangerous hazard,</em> I mentally noted. It wouldn't have taken much for someone to slip in and be swept away by it.</p><p>The mill workers didn't have much more information than anyone else, though the site overseer <em> did </em> know the general location that Genmai was supposed to be scouting.</p><p>"Alright," Kakashi-sensei said, tapping the local map. "We'll start with this area then spiral out from there. It's well away from the river, but if we cover the entire area and don't turn up anything we'll start searching downstream. Let's go. Keep your eyes open as we travel."</p><p>We shouldered our packs and took off through the trees. This close to the mill, there was too much activity for any sort of track to stand out. Well. Kakashi-sensei might have been able to but I couldn't.</p><p>"Okay, we'll make this our reconnaissance point," Kakashi-sensei said as we all landed in a clearing. "First we'll-" he cut himself off, head snapping up.</p><p>I cast my chakra sense out, but I felt nothing. But there were more signs that something was wrong than just chakra.</p><p>"Stay here," Kakashi-sensei ordered tersely, jumping up into the branches.</p><p>"What was that?" Naruto wondered.</p><p>I shook my head. "No idea. But we best do as he says." Kakashi-sensei's chakra was moving fast, and before long he was out of my range. It did make me a little uneasy though.</p><p>"We should be alert," Sasuke said quietly, dark eyes regarding the surrounding forest.</p><p>I could see his reasoning. Whatever had caught Kakashi-sensei's attention might not be the only danger in the forest.</p><p>Minutes later, he was proven grimly correct. A huge chakra flare went off somewhere nearby, with bright light and loud sound. Birds scattered into the sky. And…</p><p>"Three incoming. North-east. Chunin or Jounin level," I said, readying my kunai.</p><p>"Enemies?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>I didn't have time to answer, because one shot forward with extreme speed and we barely had time to move before the ground was destroyed where we had been standing.</p><p>"Hey!" Naruto shouted at the man now standing in the middle of the clearing. He was reasonably tall, dressed in pale blues with a hood designed to resemble a sharks head. Tentatively, I tagged him as a water type since anybody who dressed that obviously to theme tended to do so to their specialisations. "What was that for?"</p><p>Two others joined him, a portly male with a fuuma shuriken strapped to his back, and a woman dressed in purple.</p><p>"Are these the ones, Kajika-sama?" the portly one asked.</p><p>Sharkhead - Kajika - nodded. "I would say so," he said, flicking his chin at us. "You're the ones with Kakashi, aren't you?"</p><p>"So what if we are?" Sasuke demanded.</p><p>Kajika <em> grinned.</em> "We were wondering if you'd like to play."</p><p>They launched forward. I had time to see the lady unsheathe two short handled sickles, before she was on me. Naruto engaged the fat one, barely managing to dodge his surprising speed, while the leader went for Sasuke.</p><p>I dodged, wove, deflected attacks. She was <em> fast.</em> I dropped my Resistance Seal and surprised her with an increase in speed, slamming a rapid two kick combo into her stomach and nearly scoring her across the neck with my kunai. It didn't last, though, because she amped up her speed to match.</p><p><em> They're toying with us,</em> I realised.</p><p>"Ten Thousand Fists!" I called up my chakra, blurring the air around me with overlapping images. She couldn't know if it was real or fake, or which attack to block, so she did the sensible thing and got clear.</p><p>I back flipped down to the ground, where Naruto had been thrown a second earlier. Sasuke, seeing us, managed to disengage and regroup.</p><p>"Hmm," Kajika mused. "You're better than I expected."</p><p>"Little bitch," Lady cursed.</p><p>"Now, now. If we finish too soon, we'll be disobeying orders."</p><p>That, coupled with the mention of Kakashi-sensei, did <em> not</em> sound good. Were they trying to distract us or something? Then again, we had been outmatched in that little fight. Without us stepping up to bigger techniques, they could have taken us out.</p><p>"You're starting to piss me off!" Naruto declared. "Shadow Clone Jutsu!"</p><p>More Naruto's shimmered into existence. They coiled, like they were about to leap.</p><p>Kajika chuckled, and then faded out of view. He hadn't moved…</p><p>"They vanished?" Naruto said, confused.</p><p>"No," Sasuke said, eyes darting back and forth. "They're still around."</p><p>I could still sense them. That didn't mean my team mates could. If we didn't do something, they'd just pick us off.</p><p>"Naruto," I hissed. "Please tell me you learnt how to sense in your Mist…"</p><p>"Yeah, kinda," he said back. "Oh. Oh!" His hand fumbled for his water canteen.</p><p>"Sasuke?" I questioned.</p><p>He grimaced. "I haven't really…" he said. "But we can't see them anyway, so I'll deal."</p><p>I nodded. There wasn't much I could do about it now. And having two of us being mostly able to spot them beat having just me.</p><p>"Running and hiding already?" Kajika's voice echoed through the chakra charged mist. "How …<em> typical</em> of a Leaf shinobi."</p><p>The three of us angled so that we were facing the same opponents as before. Kajika's taunts enabling Sasuke to find him.</p><p>On cue, we hurled kunai towards them, disappointed to hear the clinking of deflection, before <em> moving.</em></p><p>"Water Release: Cold Sky Water Attack!" Kajika shouted, before rapid fire bullets slammed into the ground where we had just been. Ice, my mind catalogued quickly.</p><p>"The fat guy is in the mist," Naruto murmured. "Should we?"</p><p>"Pick <em> them</em> off, one by one," Sasuke finished grimly.</p><p>"I'll snare him, you two take him out?" I suggested.</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>I darted away, circling around the spot where I <em> knew</em> he was. He was still using whatever invisibility technique they had - and wasn't that cool? I so wanted to learn that - but I could sense him.</p><p>I harnessed my shadow and lashed out. He never even noticed it. "Shadow Possession Complete," I murmured.</p><p>Sasuke flickered away, appearing where my shadow ended and lashing out with a knife hand strike at the height where a neck should be. He apparently struck successfully, because the jutsu faded and the man sagged in my hold.</p><p>A quick twist of ninja wire to tie him up and we were fading away back into the mist.</p><p>"The other two are staying out of the mist," Naruto said quietly, sounding put out.</p><p>"Can we draw them in?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"If they're clever enough to get distance, they're probably clever enough to stay there," I said.</p><p>"So what are we going to do?" Sasuke asked, frustrated. "I can't see them, and Naruto can't sense them outside the Mist…"</p><p>I bit my lip. "I'll take the lady. If I give you a general location… you use area of effect jutsu? They haven't been attacking, so I assume they can't hold that invisibility and fight at the same time. Radiating Shockwave, Great Fireball… that'll give you enough chances to hit him and disrupt the jutsu."</p><p>Naruto grinned. "I'm on it."</p><p>"You'll be okay by yourself?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>I nodded. "Of course." I'd have to be. I took out a kunai and wrapped an explosive tag around the handle. "On my signal."</p><p>We crept forward. There was something eerie about the way the forest was completely silent. I crouched, located the two chakra signals and sorted plans in my mind. I placed on hand on the ground, ink blooming under my fingers.</p><p><em> Countdown, start.</em></p><p>With an explosive burst of chakra I leapt, crossing the distance to the first person in the blink of an eye. At the apex of my jump, I twisted, hurling the kunai with full force to the second. I kept turning, using the momentum of my spin to bring my leg around, for a kick with my full weight and power behind it. It struck something that didn't budge, and the invisibility jutsu faded to reveal Lady's arms crossed in a block. I used them as leverage to leap up, somersaulting over her head to land on the branch beside her, kunai out to block her sickles.</p><p>I could see the flares of light, feel the chakra surges, as the boys attacked, but I was more focused on my own opponent. They would be fine. The mist was fading as Naruto ceased the jutsu, water falling to dampen the ground. It would make footing more treacherous on the lower branches, but these two had stayed well out of range.</p><p>I blocked and twisted, deflecting her blades, but she was brutal, hammering blow after blow down on me. I tried to retreat, but she pursued me ruthlessly.</p><p>I swung down and she was there. I jumped backwards and she was there.</p><p>"Not so cocky now, are we?" she smirked.</p><p><em> That's it,</em> I thought. <em> Just a little more. </em></p><p>I inched backwards along the branch, like a tightrope. She stalked forward, so convinced I was trapped and harmless. She lashed out and I rolled sideways, hitting the ground in a crouch. She followed, sandals squelching in the mud.</p><p><em> Three… </em></p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," I said with a sign, hands folded into the rat seal.</p><p><em> Two… </em></p><p>"Why you-" she struggled, unable to move. "I'm going to kill you."</p><p><em> One…</em></p><p>And then, right beneath her feet, the ink seal I had placed before went off.</p><p>I panted a bit, at the sudden end to the fight, but I was hardly exhausted. Naruto and Sasuke had been drawn quite a distance away. I recognised it as the direction that the river was in. If Kajika <em> was</em> a water type, then we hardly wanted him getting near a huge source of it. That boded ill for us.</p><p>I dashed off, dampening my chakra to circle around the fight. Naruto and Sasuke were doing quite well, working in tandem against Kajika. They weren't <em> unscathed</em> but they weren't injured enough to hamper them. Kajika was fighting back with impressive taijutsu and a range of water release ninjutsu. It was clearly taxing him, though, to use it so much when there wasn't a ready source of water about.</p><p>I picked an ambush position and sat in wait. As expected, he was trying to make a break for the river. Naruto and Sasuke were hardly <em> letting</em> him though.</p><p>With so many trees about, it was easy enough to extend my shadow through them and wait until he crossed it's path.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," I announced.</p><p>"Ha!" Naruto said, a glint in his eye. "Take this! Rasengan!" A clone helped him form it and he shoved it forward, straight into Kajika's stomach.</p><p>I stumbled backwards at the sheer <em> force</em> of the jutsu, releasing my Shadow Possession. One of the downsides of the jutsu was that when the victim was moved by outside forces, that tended to reverberate back to the user. The Rasengan clearly wasn't just a drill, it had tremendous pushing power.</p><p>Kajika flew backwards, smacking into a tree.</p><p>I sighed, standing up straight, feeling like a heavy weight was settling on my shoulders.</p><p>"We should find Sensei," Sasuke started, then cut himself off.</p><p>Because Kajika stood back up.</p><p>I couldn't help the small sound of surprise I made, almost in unison with Naruto's "what the?"</p><p>He stood and he was radiating foul, rancid, purple chakra that was vaguely familiar to me. It was the same chakra Sasuke had had after Orochimaru had marked him.</p><p><em> Not good.</em></p><p>"You fight well, Sasuke," he rasped, stepping forward in such a way that it was clear there was something <em> wrong.</em> His eyes, when he looked up, were slitted yellow.</p><p>"Who are you?" Sasuke asked warily. "What do you want?"</p><p>"That creepy chakra," Naruto muttered. "It's not even the same guy…"</p><p>"I would commend you on beating a stronger foe," he said, ignoring Sasuke questions. "But if you need friends to help you… you can forget about beating Itachi."</p><p>Sasuke stiffened. "You know of Itachi?" he demanded.</p><p>"He is strong. Much stronger than you'll ever be," the-thing-that-was-Kajika continued.</p><p>"What's your point?" Sasuke growled.</p><p>"How can you be content with this?"</p><p>"I'll take my revenge on him one way or another," Sasuke barked, hands clenching into fists. Naruto looked apprehensive.</p><p>"That's the spirit," Kajika said and chuckled. I shivered. Oh yes, that was Orochimaru's laugh.</p><p>Then I felt the chakra surge. "Get back!" I shouted, leaping backwards, as the body exploded, toppling forwards.</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>"Just what the hell was that?" Naruto shouted. "With the - then he-!" His arms flailed about.</p><p>"I don't know," Sasuke said, eyes trained on the charred body.</p><p>"That chakra…" I said. "It felt like… your curse mark."</p><p>His eyes lifted to me. "Orochimaru?"</p><p>I shrugged, helplessly.</p><p>Naruto scoffed. "That stupid snake freak. I should have figured. He was wrong, anyway," he said blithely. "If all three of us can take down his stupid puppet, then the three of us can <em> totally</em> take down Itachi. You better believe it!"</p><p>Sasuke was silent for a second. "We better find Kakashi-sensei," was all he said.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei wasn't hard to find, but what we saw when we did find him made us pause in the trees.</p><p>"That doesn't look good," Naruto said, stating the obvious.</p><p>"Don't touch it," I said, taking in the seal that lit up the entire pathway. It spiralled out around the body of a man that looked an awful lot like it might be Genmai. Kakashi-sensei was kneeling next to him, writing something on the ground and gave absolutely no indication that he could hear us.</p><p>"What is it?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"A seal trap," I squinted at it. "Activated by contact… I guess when he touched Genmai? It seems to be centred on him. Containment… chakra…" I tried to read what the specifications were, but it was difficult. I wasn't a <em> master</em> at this. Studying was one thing, actually applying it was another. "He can't leave the circle, I think."</p><p>"Should we help?" Naruto asked anxiously.</p><p>"Sensei looks like he knows what he's doing," Sasuke answered. "Look. He must know how to get out."</p><p>I nodded. "Maybe if we keep a perimeter? In case anyone else is around?"</p><p>It didn't take Kakashi-sensei much longer to diffuse the trap, and when it faded away, he blinked up at us, taking in our scruffy, semi-exhausted appearance.</p><p>"Sensei," Naruto said, very seriously. "You're late."</p><p>Sasuke snorted.</p><p>"Mah, sorry," Kakashi-sensei said, eye curving into a smile. "Something came up."</p><p>The man lying on the dirt groaned, waking up. "What… what's going on?"</p><p>"Ah, let's get you back to the village, Genmai-san," Kakashi-sensei said, offering him a hand.</p><p><em> Well,</em> I thought. <em> At least the mission was a success.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>So, this mission comes from the OVA: The Cross Roads. I think it's technically supposed to take place earlier, but with the whole Orochimaru tempting thing, I think it fits here just as well.</p><p>The Chunin promotions haven't been forgotten, don't worry. They don't actually take place till after the Land of Tea arc in the anime, which makes sense since I think that Tsunade has bigger things to worry about. Still, they'll be along soon.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Search and Rescue Arc: Chapter 45</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - I think Kakashi was far more <em> worried. </em> His Genin have proven that they can get in serious trouble the minute he takes his eyes off them. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 45</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The roots of true achievement lie in the will to become the best that you can become.~ Harold Taylor</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>We took Genmai back to his village and watched him reunite with his son first, because he <em> really</em> didn't need to hear this.</p><p>Then, we filled Kakashi-sensei in on just what had happened. He listened grimly, especially when I mentioned Orochimaru. Now, post battle, and having to sort my thoughts out to report to Kakashi-sensei, I could see things that troubled me.</p><p>Orochimaru was after Sasuke. That much was obvious. But they hadn't tried to <em> take </em> him. He had used them to try and convince him.</p><p>"But," Naruto said, puzzled. "How did he know we were going to be here?"</p><p>Yeah. And that.</p><p>"A very good question," Kakashi-sensei said heavily.</p><p>Because that <em> seriously</em> implied a level of information about and/or <em> control over</em> Konoha administration that he shouldn't have had.</p><p>"Where did you fight?" Sensei asked.</p><p>"Where you left us," Sasuke answered, hands in his pockets. "At the reconnaissance point."</p><p>We went back there. Kakashi-sensei only paid cursory attention to the two sidekicks - dead and tied up - before turning his attention to Kajika.</p><p>"Kajika Futodoki," he said. "Jounin missing-nin from Mist." He glanced at us and shook his head.</p><p>I was a little surprised, too. He'd been strong, no doubt about that, but B-rank or low A-rank rather than what I considered <em> Jounin.</em> Maybe I'd just had too much contact with the elite.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei knelt and peeled away the strange hood. "One of Orochimaru's alright," he said.</p><p>I peered over his shoulder. Oh. Curse mark.</p><p>"It looks different," Sasuke observed quietly.</p><p>"Mm," Sensei said. "I've seen those ones before." That was <em> interesting.</em> Just how much experience had Kakashi-sensei had with curse marks? He <em> had</em> known how to seal up Sasuke's…</p><p>"They're one of the prototype stages," he continued. "Control… or maybe a better word would be 'possession'."</p><p>The chakra but no attack. The yellow eyes. The voice and laugh. "That wasn't a self-destruct jutsu," I realised. "It was done by Orochimaru."</p><p>"Most likely," Kakashi-sensei agreed.</p><p>I swallowed. "Talk about a guy that doesn't value his subordinates."</p><p>Sensei pulled out a scroll and started drawing up the seal to store the body away. Well, yeah. I guess we couldn't just <em> leave </em> them here. I went to seal up the other body to save time.</p><p>Then we dropped the prisoner off at the nearby outpost, which was a little out of our way but still better than trying to carry him all the way back to Konoha. The outpost was big enough to have cells, and there'd be a specialised prisoner retrieval team dispatched to pick him up.</p><p>We got back to Konoha fairly late in the afternoon, which was still impressive timing considering, and headed for the Hokage Tower.</p><p>"Err," Naruto said. "Aren't we going to the Missions Desk?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei smiled. "Ah, sometimes you just need to go straight to the Hokage. Although, you generally need to be a Jounin before you get to <em> decide </em> if you need to…"</p><p>Translation; if Kakashi Hatake decided he needed to see the Hokage, he got to see the Hokage.</p><p>We did still need to check in with the secretary that managed her appointments, but luckily for us Tsunade was free. She didn't necessarily look too impressed with us though.</p><p>"I gave you a C-rank mission," she stated. "You can't <em> possibly</em> need to see me."</p><p>"Ah," Kakashi-sensei said. "About that."</p><p><hr /></p><p>We didn't really hear more about it after that, and to be honest, I didn't really expect to. Genin weren't exactly in on confidential information, especially if they were trying to keep the whole thing quiet and take the infiltrators by surprise.</p><p>We had another couple of days off that we filled with team training. Kakashi-sensei drilled us through a series of team work exercises that were surprisingly difficult, but it was good to be working together again.</p><p>Then we got called up to see Tsunade again.</p><p>"To be honest with you, I don't know what to do," Tsunade said, eyes sweeping over us.</p><p>Well that was a promising start. She'd called all three rookie teams into her office, complete with sensei, without any explanation for <em> why.</em> I had an inkling, though, because we weren't the only ones here. Ibiki, Anko, Hayate, several Chunin dressed in Intelligence Division greys including Kotetsu and Izumo… clearly this had to do with the Chunin Exams.</p><p>Her next statement clinched it. "With the Final Exam being suspended, it was the opinion of many that none of the students should pass this time around." She paused, but I very much doubted she had called us all here just to say no one was getting promoted. For starters, Team Gai wasn't here. If all she was saying was 'sorry, but no' then Neji would have been here too.</p><p>"However," she continued. "I hear that the Third Hokage had nothing but the highest praise for a number of you. Indeed," she cast a faintly annoyed look over her shoulder. "The Proctors of the Exam have argued heavily in favour of promoting several of you. So, in this case, my opinion doesn't really matter. Would the following people please step forward."</p><p>She picked up a piece of paper. It was entirely unnecessary, and I'm sure she was just doing it to increase the tension.</p><p>"Shino Aburame. Shikamaru Nara and," she smiled faintly. "Naruto Uzumaki."</p><p>Naruto froze. I elbowed him in the side but he didn't move until Kakashi-sensei put a firm hand on his shoulder and shoved him forward to stand beside the other two.</p><p>"From this day forth, I hope you will strive to achieve a level of excellence worthy of that headband. Congratulations, as of this moment you stand a Chunin."</p><p>"Me?" Naruto blurted out, overwhelmed with shock.</p><p>"Yes, you," Tsunade said. "The Third Hokage had you slated for guaranteed promotion, and the Proctors were all in agreement on that case. I guess you really impressed them, brat." She was really smiling now, eyes crinkling with good humour.</p><p>"Way to go, you guys!" Kiba crowed, apparently having decided that was the end of the formal stuff. "I knew you could do it, Shino!" Kurenai didn't scold him; she was practically beaming with pride.</p><p>Shino adjusted his glasses, which seemed to be some kind of nervous tick of his. "I am surprised. Why? Because I lost the match."</p><p>Hayate coughed. "It's as the Third Hokage said before the Exam. Winning is not the criteria by which promotion is judged. You managed to show the qualities of a Chunin during your match - one of which was the good judgement to resign when cornered."</p><p>If Shino hadn't resigned, and Shikamaru had thrown those kunai, he would have taken serious damage for no benefit because he <em> still</em> would have lost the match.</p><p>"These are the only three of the promotions that all the Proctors were in complete agreement on," Tsunade cut in. "Still, for an Exam that didn't get past the first round, I'd say it's a pretty good sweep. Congratulations."</p><p>Ino looked disappointed but resigned. She'd had a good match, but the way Temari had managed to take her out had pointed out a critical flaw in her planning. That wasn't really something that could be overlooked, and she knew it.</p><p>Sasuke just nodded curtly. His match had been interrupted, true, but even before then he hadn't shown much in the way of tactics. An impressive mastery of Taijutsu and Ninjutsu, yes, but more of the 'hit it until it stops moving' kind. Granted, facing Gaara didn't leave him with many options, but still.</p><p>"Con-congratulations, Naruto," Hinata said softly.</p><p>"Heh, thanks Hinata," Naruto replied, tucking his hands behind his head. "I wasn't really even thinking about being promoted. I just wanted to show Neji that he was wrong, y'know, about people like us."</p><p>A faint pink spread across her face probably from the 'like us' comment.</p><p>The shinobi behind Tsunade had broken away to mingle. Izumo and Kotetsu made a beeline for us.</p><p>"Who would have thought, huh?" Kotetsu said, clapping Naruto on the shoulder. "You sure surprised us, you know."</p><p>Naruto chuckled sheepishly. "Well, Kaka-sensei does say I'm the most unpredictable ninja."</p><p>"I can believe that," Izumo said with a smirk. He nodded at me. "Sorry you didn't get through, kid. We recommended you be reconsidered and a couple of the guys agreed with us, but the Hokage put her foot down on anything less than complete agreement."</p><p>I blinked, startled. "I didn't even make it to the Final Exam," I protested.</p><p>"You impressed a few people anyway," Kotetsu said with a shrug. "The first two exams aren't <em> just</em> to get the numbers down, you know. And technically anything within the exam period counts…"</p><p>So, they'd not only been <em> listening</em> to us in the stands, they'd been <em> judging</em> too. Well. That was embarrassing.</p><p>"Oh," I said faintly. "Thank you, then." Given that I hadn't been expecting anything, it was easy to shrug off.</p><p>"Alright, everyone," Tsunade barked. "Out of my office. I've got work to do!"</p><p>The three new Chunin had to go down to Requestions to get their new vests. The flack jackets weren't <em> compulsory</em> to wear, but most Chunin and Jounin did anyway as marks of their rank and simply because they were <em> handy,</em> with moderate padding for armour and a decent array of pockets.</p><p>While the other two didn't seem too fussed, apart from some extra pride in Shino's case and extra slouching in Shikamaru's, Naruto had apparently decided that his new Chunin vest was the <em> coolest thing ever.</em></p><p>Which was fair enough. It was one of the first symbols of actual <em> recognition</em> he'd received, right up there with his Konoha headband.</p><p>That didn't mean it wasn't annoying.</p><p>"Oh, man, this is so cool! Can you believe it?" Naruto asked for about the twelfth time. I think Sasuke was starting to develop a twitch.</p><p>"Yes, Naruto," I repeated. Again. "We should…" I was about to say 'celebrate' except I <em> knew</em> he'd want to go to Ichiraku and we'd only just had lunch. I didn't think I could stomach a bowl of ramen like now. "Keep training. We've got a lot to do," I finished, if a little weakly.</p><p>"You're right!" Naruto declared. "Just because I became a Chunin doesn't mean I can slack off! There's people out there that are way stronger." He clenched a fist and raised it high. "Let's go!"</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Whatever worked.</p><p>Then Naruto paused. "Hey, if I'm a Chunin… does that mean you guys have to listen to me?"</p><p>Sasuke snorted. "In your dreams, dead last."</p><p><hr /></p><p>After training, I met up with Ino outside the Hokage Tower and we meandered to the nearby park, claiming one of the picnic tables for our own. Ino had been really keen on the 'study group' idea, and given that we were all currently in Konoha, had decided it was time for the first meeting. If we kept this up, we'd have to come up with a better meeting place - particularly when the weather turned - but for now, with warm afternoon sunshine and no wind to speak of, outside was fine.</p><p>"So Hinata was absolutely delighted," Ino said, cracking open one of her books. "You'd have thought I'd invited her to a party or something."</p><p>"I guess she doesn't get many excuses to hang out," I said. "Sakura should be finishing soon, right?"</p><p>"Yeah. She might stop to grab something to eat though." Ino frowned slightly. "You know, I'm not that informed on the whole medic training thing, but they don't normally work at the hospital, do they?"</p><p>"No," I agreed. "Not till much later anyway. But they're hardly going to turn away people that volunteer and it does earn her major kudos. Unofficially, anyway. I'd say it was a sneaky way to ingrate herself, if I thought she was doing it on purpose."</p><p>Even though Konoha <em> tried</em> to be fair, there was still a very large degree of 'who you know'. Once training had been completed, the new med-nin still had to be assigned jobs. Typically, whoever was in charge of those assignments was more likely to recognise clan names (particularly their own) and accept that those people had adequate training. Considering that they typically got extra instruction that the rest didn't, it wasn't an incorrect assumption, just unfair. Thus, those clan kids typically got the best postings. That wasn't even going into how head of departments could request specific people be assigned to them, usually relatives. Sakura, by making herself known at the hospital, was circumventing that.</p><p>And while it was taking time away from studying, Sakura had always been an excellent student.</p><p>Ino snickered. "Sounds about right."</p><p>"Hey, there's Hinata," I said, catching sight of her familiar jacket.</p><p>Ino stood on the seat, waving her arms. "Hey Hinata!" she shouted. "Over here!"</p><p>There weren't that many people around, so it was pretty unnecessary. Then again, Ino had never felt <em> any</em> shame for being loud and the centre of attention.</p><p>"Hi," Hinata said with a pretty flush. "I'm not late?"</p><p>"Nah," I said easily. "We're still waiting on Sakura. How are you?"</p><p>We chatted until Sakura got there, not too long after.</p><p>"Sorry, sorry," she panted, dropping a stack of books on the table. "I tried to hurry."</p><p>"Don't worry about it," Ino said, brushing it off. "We haven't been here long."</p><p>"Right," Sakura said. "So how are we going to do this?"</p><p>Ino paused. "No idea, actually," she admitted cheerfully. "I call getting us all in one place a minor miracle. Didn't think much beyond that."</p><p>I snickered. "Maybe if we work out what each of us knows, first. Then we can figure out where to go from there."</p><p>It was pretty much as expected. Ino was fairly well grounded on the medicinal properties of plants, but only beginning to learn about the human body itself.</p><p>Sakura had a surprising wealth of information, far beyond what her classes covered. Apparently she'd been reading ahead, and the other med-nin and nurses had been more than willing to part with tip and tricks during the hospital day. She was pretty good at forming Yin medical chakra, though hadn't actually used it for anything yet.</p><p>Hinata also had a fairly comprehensive knowledge of the body, probably augmented by her Byakugan, but stuck solely to making salves and ointments.</p><p>"You don't know any medical jutsu?" I asked curiously.</p><p>She shook her head. "I c-can't use them," she stammered. "Because of the Jyuuken."</p><p>I paused, remembering how I'd tried to make chakra blocks, only to have them fade away when I disconnected. For Jyuuken to continue to affect people <em> after</em> being hit, there must have been something making it… solid. It might have been a natural extension of their Bloodlimit or it might have been harnessed through training. Something so attack based would be difficult to change to <em> healing</em> chakra.</p><p>"Because you make those chakra plugs," I expanded. "It means you can't form Yin natured chakra. Or if you could, it would set your Jyuuken back, a lot." There were Hyuuga medics, after all. But Hinata was the clan heiress, and she was expected to fight.</p><p>Hinata nodded, a little miserable.</p><p>"That's okay," Ino cut in, brightly. "There's plenty that can be done without medical jutsu."</p><p>"She's right," Sakura agreed. "Why don't you tell us about your ointments? How effective are they?"</p><p>Hinata brightened.</p><p><hr /></p><p>So there's the promotions. XD Congrats to everyone who guessed right.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Snow Arc: Chapter 46</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: I've seen a couple of variations on where Snow Country is <em> actually</em> located, so there seems to be no official word. I'm placing it to the south, past the Land of Tea, since they needed to take a boat and going east through Land of Water seems pretty dangerous.</p><p>Nemesis Jedi - Tenten hasn't been forgotten, don't worry. XD It's just that she doesn't move in the same social circles as the rest of them so it's hard to justify it. IIRC Tenten did want to be a med nin at one stage. Will have to look up that episode. And Naruto has never shown much fashion sense… red sage coat over orange, anyone?</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 46</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> You cannot run away from weakness; you must some time fight it out or perish; and if that be so, why not now, and where you stand? ~Robert Louis Stevenson</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Hey, Baa-chan!" Naruto called, slamming the doors to the Mission Assignment Desk room open. "Got anything good for us?"</p><p>I felt like face palming.</p><p>Tsunade twitched. "Don't call me that, brat!" Then her face took on a sly look. "Well, if you're going to be so rude, then I might not give you this mission. That would be a shame, wouldn't it? It's A-rank, long term and I've had <em> quite a few</em> people asking about it…"</p><p>Naruto practically vibrated on the spot.</p><p>She sighed theatrically. "But maybe I can find a nice D-rank for you instead. I think we have a Tora mission here somewhere…"</p><p>"No! Baa-chan!" Naruto practically wailed. "I mean, Tsunade the Most Awesomest Hokage Ever." He abruptly changed to at her raised eyebrow. "Please, please give us the cool mission! Don't make me face the demon cat again!"</p><p>There were quite a few snickers in the room.</p><p>"Cool mission indeed," she murmured quietly. "Alright, brat, your flattery needs work but I'll let it slide this time. Like I said, it's an A-rank mission. Body guarding. Mission specs include a fair amount of travel, so hopefully that should keep you out of trouble." Her eyes flicked to Sasuke, just for a second.</p><p><em> So, somewhere to get Sasuke away from Orochimaru?</em> I wondered. Was that even possible?</p><p>"I'll let your sensei fill you in on the rest," she said, throwing the mission scroll to Kakashi. "There's no point in me rehashing the details."</p><p>It was interesting that Tsunade was personally selecting our missions, but if she really was trying to help protect Sasuke from her old team mate then it made sense. And, well, everyone knew she had an interest in Naruto.</p><p>Sensei took the scroll and we crashed in one of the briefing rooms while he read over it.</p><p>"Ahuh," he murmured, nodding. "Oh, I see. How very interesting…"</p><p>Naruto was practically bouncing on the spot. "What? What? What is it, Sensei?"</p><p>Sasuke was glaring at him every time he spoke, a very impatient 'get on with it already' glare.</p><p>I <em> knew</em> the only reason he was doing it was to wind them up.</p><p>"Sennnnseiiii," Naruto whined, dragging the syllables out.</p><p>"Mah, mah, Chunin need to be patient, you know," Kakashi-sensei said. "It's a good quality."</p><p>Naruto's face was priceless.</p><p>Sensei let him suffer for a moment, before starting. "The client is Sandayuu Asama. We're being hired to protect his company as they take a tour of the Land of Snow." There was a slight pause before the word 'company'.</p><p>"Land of Snow?" Naruto parroted. "Where's that?"</p><p>"It's on a separate continent, to the south," I said, frowning. "We don't usually have much contact with them." I didn't actually know all that much about the place. Like I said, there wasn't much contact.</p><p>"Very rarely," Kakashi-sensei confirmed. "Most of the countries there have their own ninja villages. The Land of Snow has the Village Hidden in the Snow, for example. None of them are really a match for the Five Great Nations, though. They're more akin to the minor villages like Hidden Waterfall or Grass."</p><p>"How long will we be gone?" Sasuke wanted to know. "Hokage-sama said it was a long term mission."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei hummed. "It depends. It might take a week to sail there, depending on currents and winds, and the tour is listed as between a month and two with the potential to extend further."</p><p>Two to three months wasn't exactly 'long term' for most ninja, but it was still the longest mission that we'd been sent on. And the furtherest.</p><p>"We'll be meeting them at the Port City and it'll probably take us three days to get there. If we leave tomorrow morning, that gives us plenty of travel time, as well as giving you kids time to put cold weather mission gear together. Land of Snow lives up to its name, trust me on that one."</p><p>That meant we'd have to bring two sets of gear, one for travelling there and one for when we arrived. If I didn't know how to make sealing scrolls, that would mean things would start getting bulky. As it was, well, sealing scrolls did take up space too; the more you put in them the bigger they had to be.</p><p>Given that we'd been Genin for about four months, we didn't even <em> have</em> cold weather gear yet.</p><p>Sensei hadn't given us many details on the whole thing, but we also hadn't met the client so I guess it could be saved for then.</p><p>I went home and found Mum, who fussed about me being sent away on a long mission so <em> soon</em> , and then proceeded to drag me all around town gathering the gear I'd need. One of the good things about shopping in a ninja town was that you could get things even when they were ridiculously out of season. I made a mental list of what we were getting, so I could make sure the boys had everything, because while there was the obvious stuff - thermals, insulated sleeping bag, heavy gloves, closed shoes <em> thank the gods</em> , Konoha standard wrap around cloaks - there were also things I never would have thought of - winter issue double walled canteens so your water didn't freeze.</p><p>"We would have had to get most of this anyway," she murmured at one point. "This is just a bit earlier than I expected."</p><p>Eventually, she decided enough was enough and I staggered home under a load of shopping.</p><p>It took me a while to organise everything and seal it away, but I was being pedantic. I didn't particularly want to get all the way to the Land of Snow and realise I'd forgotten to pack socks or something. You could use chakra to regulate your temperature to a certain extent - and most ninja did - but in snowing climates, proper gear was a must.</p><p>Then I went to assist the boys and found that Kakashi-sensei had actually taken it on himself to help them pack - separately, of course.</p><p>Then, since I actually had time, I went and said goodbye to everyone. Ino was jealous that we always seemed to get the <em> interesting</em> missions, but I told her that I doubted freezing for two months in a place optimistically called the Land of Snow was <em> interesting.</em></p><p>So bright and early the next morning - ish, we had to wait for Sensei to show up - we left Konoha and headed east of the Port City where we'd meet our client.</p><p>Travelling together, being together twenty four hours a day, meant that I noticed the unsettled undercurrent to our interactions, subtle and uncomfortable like stone grinding on stone. It didn't affect our fighting, and we'd already displayed that we could work well together still, but our equilibrium had been unsettled and we didn't know how to react. Naruto being promoted just upset the makeup of the squad even further.</p><p>I would have said Kakashi-sensei was completely unaffected by our drama, except… except… it was just little things. An extra sweep of the campsite at night. Not letting us stray too far away. Given that Sasuke seemed to have a bullseye on his back, it might have even been justified. Except it kinda seemed like <em> hovering.</em></p><p>We arrived with no trouble at all, having made the trip easily.</p><p>"Well, we made good time," Kakashi-sensei said cheerfully, looking up and down the street. People were giving us a wide berth, but that was probably because he had just jumped down from the rooftops. "It's a few hours before we need to meet the client, so why don't you kids go and amuse yourselves?" He glanced behind us. "Oh, look. There's a cinema. They're showing the new Unlucky Princess film right now. You should watch that."</p><p>He shoved something into Sasuke's hands, then up and vanished.</p><p>I stared at the empty spot where he had been, absolutely mystified.</p><p>"Uh," Naruto said. "What?"</p><p>Why on earth did Kakashi-sensei want us to go watch a movie, and that one in particular?</p><p>Sasuke looked equally bewildered. "I don't know." His hands opened, revaluing a set of crumbled notes.</p><p>Okay, and Sensei had even given us the money for it. That was… unusual.</p><p>"I guess we better," I said. "There's <em> probably</em> a reason for it."</p><p>We shrugged. There wasn't really any reason <em> not</em> to.</p><p>The acting was very good, though some of the lines were a bit corny. Actually having a working knowledge of how fights went meant that the fight scenes were slightly less dramatic than intended and the use of chakra… well, I wont say it's <em> impossible</em> since there's probably a blood limit or special technique out there <em> somewhere</em> like that, but it certainly wasn't standard.</p><p>Apart from that, with a bit of suspension of disbelief, it was actually a good movie.</p><p>Naruto seemed to enjoy it anyway. I think that was because Princess Fuun's catchphrase was 'I wont give up'.</p><p>The cinema itself was next to the film studio, and there was a good bit of space out front, so we decided to wait there for Kakashi-sensei to show up.</p><p>"That," Naruto declared. "Was an <em> awesome</em> movie. I wonder if there are princesses like Fuun around."</p><p>"Well, I guess daughters of Daimyos can be called princesses," I said. "But I doubt there are any sword wielding, chakra using princesses on a quest to defeat an evil sorcerer." Or whatever the quest had been. Having not seen the previous Unlucky Princess films I was a bit hazy on that.</p><p>"It's just a story," Sasuke added.</p><p>Naruto was about to argue when he was cut off by a horse jumping over the wall to the film studio. We blinked, startled, and then darted aside as the gates swung open and a set of armour clad riders charged out.</p><p>"Wha- hey!" Naruto shouted. "That's Princess Fuun! We have to stop them!" He jumped up and darted after them.</p><p>A group of men chasing a single woman was the kind of situation that we involved ourselves in automatically, mission or no. And generally, the person fleeing was the victim, particularly when the pursuers were so obviously intimidating. But, not <em> always.</em></p><p>And it was the times when it <em> wasn't</em> true that it came back to bite you.</p><p>So first step; information gathering. Finding out who and <em> why</em> and just what, exactly, was going on. Sometimes it could be done observationally, but sometimes you just had to <em> ask.</em></p><p>"Wait! Naruto," I called after him, exchanging a glance with Sasuke. He looked ready to act. "If I pin them with Shadow Jutsu, you surround them with clones and then we can ask what's going on."</p><p>We darted after them, taking to the rooftops to cut across in front of them. I waited till they entered the shadow cast by a tall building before dropping down, and lashing out. It was tricky work, but I'd always been better at the fiddly things like timing and multiple capture than straight out power. A single fleeing woman and at least ten pursuers, all of them on horses? Tricky, but not impossible.</p><p>Naruto, obligingly created clones to surround everyone, cutting Fuun off from the rest protectively.</p><p>"Just what is going on here?" Sasuke demanded, standing with arms crossed and ready to spring into action, on a cart that had been overturned during the chase. It gave him extra height and a vantage point</p><p>"Pretty obvious…" Naruto muttered lowly. It was in Naruto's nature to jump straight into things head first, but I did prefer to be cautious when possible.</p><p>But, what the leader of the gang had to say <em> wasn't </em> at all obvious. "Ah, you must be the ninja from Konoha. What excellent timing." He had a polite and cultured voice and seemed pleased about it.</p><p>"What?" Sasuke asked, thrown.</p><p>"Yes, I am Sandayuu Asama. The lady behind you is Yukie Fujikaze, who you will be protecting for this mission. Yukie," he said, addressing her instead. "Please come back to the studio."</p><p>She glared at him sullenly, pretty face pulled into an unattractive scowl. "I don't want to."</p><p>Oh dear. Well, at least it didn't look like I had to keep everyone immobile. I dropped the shadow jutsu, but the only reactions was that some of the horses tossed their heads and jittered nervously in place.</p><p>"I apologise for this," Sandayuu said, with a bow. "Yukie is a wonderful actor, but she has been… difficult during this last film."</p><p>"So, wait," Naruto frowned. "What happened? You were chasing her… and who are these guys?"</p><p>"Ah, places that house famous people are often targets, so the film studio has its own security guards. We also have several body guards who work as stuntmen for the film," Sandayuu explained. He gave a nod to the guards who moved to surround Yukie. She gave no reaction. "Please, if we return to the studio, we will be much more comfortable."</p><p>I shrugged. Naruto was still frowning, but he acquiesced with a 'sure, I guess.'</p><p>Kakashi-sensei arrived just as we were returning. His eye roved over the whole group of us, apparently trying to determine what had happened. "Well," he drawled, "I see you've all met each other."</p><p>"Yes, indeed," Sandayuu said. "And they were a wonderful help." He shook his head. "Managing to stop all of us at once, just what one would expect from a Konoha ninja."</p><p>"I see," Kakashi-sensei said, because he might not have known what happened, but the client wasn't upset about it so it was fine. "I'm Kakashi Hatake and this is my squad."</p><p>'Genin Team' was only two thirds accurate now, so squad or team were actually the correct terminology. Usually, when promotions happened, the Chunin was placed with a Chunin squad and another Genin was placed, or the teams were rearranged. It hadn't happened with us, or any of the other rookie nine. It could have been because we <em> were</em> rookies and had only been ninja for a few months and they thought we needed the experience we'd gain under a Jounin-sensei still.</p><p>"Sandayuu Asama," he introduced again. "Please, come with me and I'll take you to the Director."</p><p>The guards took the horses away and went around the side of the building where I glimpsed outdoor sets and stables while we went inside. It was a flurry of activity in there too, with people moving backdrops and lights and chattering busily.</p><p>"Sensei," I asked lowly, as we moved inside. "What <em> exactly </em> is our mission?" I should have asked for details earlier, really. I had thought Kakashi-sensei would tell us before we needed to know. But we'd had a whole three days to get here and I hadn't asked once.</p><p>Sensei sighed. "Our mission is to protect the actress who plays Princess Fuun, Fujikaze Yukie. We're her escorts for the duration of the filming."</p><p>A man with blond hair carrying a megaphone overheard and nodded eagerly. "This is the first time The Unlucky Princess will be filmed overseas. But Fujikaze Yukie plays the most critical role."</p><p>"And all the way to Snow Country, too," another man said. I thought he might also have been one of the actors. Kin? "Everyone is really excited. Well, apart from Yukie."</p><p>"The Rainbow Glaciers," someone else confirmed. "It's said that in spring, they glow with seven colours."</p><p>I probably should have been more excited to meet famous actors than I really was. But I'd never really been the type to follow celebrities, or even really watch movies and much less so since I'd arrived here.</p><p>"That's nothing more than a myth," Kakashi-sensei said. "In the real Snow Country, there is no such thing as spring."</p><p>"Kakashi, was it?" the Director asked. "I've heard that you've been to Snow Country before…"</p><p>"A long time ago," Kakashi-sensei confirmed, clearly not wanting to expand on that. I didn't know if I should be surprised or not; Kakashi had been a ninja for a long time, there were probably few places he <em> hadn't</em> been.</p><p>"Snow Country is quite a poor nation, I heard," the actor continued. "The economy collapsed several years ago and it never recovered. They have a lot of technology though."</p><p>"I hope they have a heater," the other one joked. "I don't really like the cold."</p><p>"Are you going to just run off like Yukie then?"</p><p>"Hey! Give me a break."</p><p>I tuned them out, turning to Sandayuu. "About Yukie…" I said. If we were supposed to be protecting her, that could prove to be a problem, if it was as bad as people were hinting at.</p><p>"She really doesn't know the meaning of the words 'motivation' or 'ambition'," the guy with the megaphone said, shrugging. "She's really quite helpless."</p><p>"But she doesn't slack off when it comes to work," the Director cut in. "I don't care about an actors private life. As long as she gives a great performance when the camera is on, I'm not going to complain. She was born to be an actress." He paused. "Thinking about it she started trying to run away when she was told she was going to Snow Country."</p><p><em> Ninja senses tingling,</em> I thought drolly.</p><p>"Does she have a history with the place?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>Sandayuu shuffled, but didn't answer.</p><p>The Director shrugged. "I wouldn't have a clue. You'd have to ask her. In fact, please do. Maybe you can get this nonsense sorted out."</p><p>The discussion went on longer, sorting out the details of the trip and so forth until it was interrupted by one of the stage hands running up to us.</p><p>"Director, Sandayuu-san," he panted. "It's Yukie. She's gone!"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Also, apparently 'furtherest' is only considered a word in New Zealand. Wikitionary tells me so.</p><p>Usually, I take Team 7 not knowing about their mission until ridiculously late as film artistic licence to cut down on the number of scenes or whatever. But here, I thought, Kakashi would probably <em> like</em> mystifying his team. Just a little. He probably planned to do a big reveal of 'FAMOUS ACTRESS' that got completely ruined by team trouble magnet.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Snow Arc: Chapter 47</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: A few questions from reviewers that I can't answer by PM:<em> When's the time skip?</em> Time skip is actually pretty far away, content wise. We've got this movie, some more filler stuff including another OVA, Sasuke Retrieval, more filler stuff including two movies and so forth. Canonically, it started when Naruto left on his trip with Jiraiya and finished when he came back. I may or may not write a time skip that may or may not be quite as long. I haven't quite decided yet, but I'm leaning towards the not.</p><p><em> Is there going to be romance?</em> I answered this a few chapters ago, and my stance on that really hasn't changed much. There wont be any for a long while. They're twelve, and that's not really an age for serious romance. Especially since Shikako is mentally a lot older, there would be a serious imbalance there.</p><p>And to Albatross Aoba - I'm sorry you feel that way. I think the Chunin Exam Arc has a lot more going for it than simply who gets promoted, especially considering that canonically the only one to get through was Shikamaru. I do believe that it was an in character decision, and that, by the way the pairs were chosen, it was a matchup that would have happened.</p><p>Nemesis Jedi - Rainbow Rasengan. Rainbow Rasengan. Nope, no matter how many times I say it, it doesn't sound any <em> less</em> hilarious.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 47</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Running away will never make you free. ~ Kenny Loggins</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>We tracked Yukie down to a small, rundown and empty bar. It didn't take long to find her, and Sandayuu himself would have probably managed without too much trouble. He didn't look surprised to find her there, that was for sure.</p><p>The way she was tipping back sake… yeah, this probably wasn't the first time.</p><p>"Gee, Nee-chan," Naruto said brightly. "There you are! Why'd you leave? You made everyone worried."</p><p>She stared at him blankly, swaying a little.</p><p>"You know, I really liked your movie," Naruto continued, either not noticing the disinterest or ignoring it. "It was so cool. "Never give up." That's almost like my motto. I won't ever give up, either. One day, I'm going to be Hokage and that's not someone who can just quit." He beamed at her. "So, Princess Fuun-"</p><p>"I'm not Princess Fuun," she cut him off, swinging her cup of sake to her mouth and nearly missing. Her muscles had the lax, uncoordinated quality of too much alcohol.</p><p>"I know," Naruto said patiently. "You're Yukie Fujikaze, the greatest actress in the Land of Fire."</p><p>She snorted. "Actress? Great?" she mocked, starting to laugh. "Being an actress is the worst job ever. It's a job for the worst kind of people. You have to follow other peoples scripts, act, live in a world full of lies… Truly stupid."</p><p>At least you <em> know</em> they're lies, I thought. You can stop playing make pretend the second the camera's are off.</p><p>I shook the thought off. That sounded surprisingly bitter.</p><p>"Are you drunk?" Naruto asked, a little disbelieving. "It's not even that late." He frowned, putting his hands on his hips.</p><p>"You are so annoying!" She said, mood turning snappish rather than maudlin. "Go away!"</p><p>"Ah, Yukie," Sandayuu said carefully, seeing that Naruto was having no luck. "Please, come with us. The ship is leaving soon and we have to get everything organised."</p><p>"That's okay." She shrugged, pouring herself another cup from the sake bottle. It sloshed heavily, thunking hollowly as she put it down - half gone, maybe. "I'm not going to board."</p><p>Sandayuu gasped. "What are you saying? Yukie…"</p><p>"It'll be okay. It happens all the time," she swayed, gesturing with her hand. "Something goes wrong… the main character gets replaced, the director gets replaced -"</p><p>"Be quiet!" he snapped, sounding forceful for the first time. "The part of Princess Fuun can only be played by you. If you don't come, you wont be able to work in this business again." He didn't say it as a threat, but like a warning. If she broke her contract with this movie, no one would trust her to hold to theirs.</p><p>"It's alright," she said indifferently. "It doesn't matter."</p><p>"Yukie…" Sandayuu said helplessly.</p><p>I felt awkward watching their drama while not really being a part of it. I wasn't entirely sure what we were supposed to do. She wasn't our client, but we'd been hired to escort her. In some cases that could include an 'against her will' clause. I looked at Sensei.</p><p>"I guess it can't be helped," he said, sliding his headband up with one hand.</p><p>Yukie turned to look at him, either curious about what he was saying, or simply because he was talking. She caught his gaze and her eyes went glassy before sliding closed. He caught her easily as she tumbled forward, returning his headband down to cover his Sharingan.</p><p>I stared at the sleeping actress feeling bemused. "Wasn't that overkill, sensei?" Surely he had other ways of knocking someone out without using his Sharingan. Heck, I knew other ways of knocking people out.</p><p>"A little, yes," Kakashi-sensei said, lifting her up. "But at least this way I'm guaranteed that she won't wake up again until the morning. Otherwise she could cause trouble or try to run away again… both of which we don't need."</p><p>That was a valid point.</p><p>I dropped back to walk next to Naruto as we made our way back to the studio. His fists were clenched and he was glaring aimlessly at the ground.</p><p>I bumped shoulders with him, questioning.</p><p>"I can't believe her," he huffed. "She's so…" he flailed his hands, searching for a word before settling on "mean".</p><p>"She's an actress," Sasuke said, slowing down to match pace with us. "She was never going to be exactly like Princess Fuun." Considering how thrilled Naruto had been during the movie, he was probably feeling a little cheated about that. Still, there wasn't anything that could be <em> done</em> about it.</p><p>"I know," Naruto said. "But 'it's the worst job' and getting drunk at a time like this! Gah, it's like Baa-chan all over again."</p><p>I smirked. "I don't think Tsunade-sama would be too impressed by the comparison."</p><p>He snickered. "I'll tell her, when we get home. I really will." He tucked his hands behind his head and grinned cheekily, in anticipation of mischief.</p><p>I exchanged looks with Sasuke. <em> Only Naruto</em> .</p><p>"We didn't get a chance to ask her about Snow Country," I realised. I didn't actually know much about Snow Country, future knowledge wise. Was it something that hadn't been shown, like our D-ranks? Or was it simply something that I had paid no attention to? Had I just forgotten? That happened, but usually I had <em> something.</em></p><p>"There's definitely something there," Sasuke confirmed. "That guy - Sandayuu - he seems to know. I guess we'll have to ask him."</p><p>"I wonder what it could be," Naruto mused. "It seems weird that someone would want to avoid a whole country." That was a good point, actually. Avoiding a person, or a specific location was one thing, avoiding a whole country was another. It said that whatever was going on was something <em> big</em> .</p><p>"We're probably going to find out," I said dryly. That seemed to be how things worked. Then again, no one ever expected an A-rank mission to be <em> easy</em> .</p><p>Back at the studio, the place was a hive of activity as the film crew were busily loading everything they were going to take with them. The ship was leaving early tomorrow morning, which meant that everything needed to be packed tonight. Sandayuu, as Yukie's manager, wasn't involved in that much, apart from making sure that all her gear was ready, which meant we had an excellent chance to question him.</p><p>"So what's her deal with Snow Country?" Naruto asked bluntly, after we'd tucked her up into her room and found an out of the way room that still had some chairs in it.</p><p>I winced. It was a good question, but it could have been asked with a little more finesse. Still, it got the point across.</p><p>"Ah, well," Sandayuu said nervously, glancing at us.</p><p>"Please," Kakashi-sensei said calmly. "You did hire us to protect her. We can do that more effectively if we know what's going on."</p><p>"Yes, that is true," he said, nodding. "Very well. Where shall I start? Ah. My name is Sandayuu Asama. I used to be a member of Snow Country's 50th Brigade; Samurai who protected the previous Daimyo, Sousetsu Kazahana."</p><p>Naruto shifted awkwardly, obviously wondering where this was going, but didn't say anything. The rest of us just listened.</p><p>"At that time, the Land of Snow was a peaceful place. Sousetsu was a good man. The economy went downhill in the last years of his reign but he did his best for his people. There are rumours that say he spent the money of battle puppets and such, but I don't believe them. Sousetsu was a gentle man, he never believed in war. He always said he would have been an engineer if he was not a Daimyo." He shook himself, obviously aware that he was drifting off course. "Ah, but the Daimyo had a young daughter, Princess-"</p><p>"Koyuki," Kakashi-sensei finished, eye wide. He looked like he had just put the pieces together to solve a puzzle.</p><p>I had a sinking feeling that I knew what was coming next.</p><p>"Yes," Sandayuu confirmed. "Princess Koyuki. When Sousetsu's brother Dotou revolted and burned the castle down, we believed that she had died. Our Daimyo was dead, his house in ruins, his loyal samurai scattered and lost… it was a dark day." His eyes started tearing up. "When I came here… when I found her acting on stage… I was so <em> happy.</em> "</p><p>"Her?" Naruto muttered, puzzled. "Yukie?"</p><p>"Yukie Fujikaze is a fake name," Kakashi-sensei said wearily. He rubbed his face. "She's really Koyuki Kazahana, isn't she?"</p><p>"Yes," Sandayuu said. "She is our princess. Our <em> hope.</em> "</p><p>"Your hope?" I repeated. That was a strange thing to say.</p><p>"I've been keeping in touch with my old friends from the brigade, and things are… restless in the Land of Snow. They're more than ready to start a rebellion, but they're scattered. If they had a figurehead, a rallying point…" He looked up at us, to see if we were following.</p><p>"The Princess," Sasuke stated.</p><p>"Yes." Sandayuu said. "Sousetsu was a good man. The people loved him. And they loved the princess. Dotou is the opposite. He's like the stereotypical evil lord, feasting while the country starves, hording whatever little wealth there is… It can't go on. One way or another, it has to change."</p><p>His conviction was obvious. Given that we hadn't seen it ourselves, I couldn't judge how truthful it was, but he <em> believed </em> it.</p><p>"And what does the princess think of this?" I asked, because I could see a <em> major</em> sticking point, there.</p><p>He faltered. "I had hoped…" he said, trailing off. "Ever since I became her manager, I have been looking for a way to return her home. Convincing the Director to film at the Rainbow Glaciers… that was a victory."</p><p>"She doesn't seem to want to go," Sasuke pointed out. From Yukie's point of view the entire situation was stressful - not wanting to go back to Snow Country because of bad memories or danger, but being unable to explain <em> why</em> without admitting who she was… No wonder she was trying to run.</p><p>"She is unhappy here," Sandayuu insisted. "Wherever we go, she is unhappy. I believe that she truly wishes to return home. She is just afraid…."</p><p>Of course she was afraid. Her home was ransacked and her family killed. She wasn't a ninja, couldn't fight back the way we could. There was more to courage than physical skills, but I would be the first to admit that they helped.</p><p>"This isn't a whim on my part," Sandayuu said. "There are plans, alliances… I even hired ninja." He gestured at us. "I do not wish to put the Princess in any danger."</p><p>There was danger inherent in being part of a rebellion, in returning to a place where she was an usurper to the throne, but he did seem to be trying to negate it.</p><p>"Well, it's all within our contract," Kakashi-sensei said, neutrally. I wondered if the contract had been specifically written like that. It was highly likely, actually, if Sandayuu had planned it out. "We have been hired to escort Yukie around Snow Country. But I would suggest convincing her of her role before we arrive."</p><p>"Thank you," he said, sighing gratefully. "Thank you."</p><p><em> What a mess. </em></p><p>It certainly gave <em> us</em> a lot to consider.</p><p>"Why would some one who was trying to hide their identity become an actress?" Sasuke asked. "Doesn't that… seem strange?"</p><p>"Maybe she didn't realise there was still danger," I offered. "She's a long way from home. Or maybe she was hiding in plain sight. If it had happened ten years ago, she would have been very young. It's not always easy to know what people look like at different ages. Unless she bears a strong resemblance to a family member, looks alone wouldn't have been enough to find her. And by then she would have been famous <em> as</em> Yukie Fujikaze, which is it's own kind of cover."</p><p>She might not have had much of a choice, depending on what happened after she left Snow Country. One would expect a young princess to be fostered by a neighbouring Daimyo either as a hostage or in preparation for future succession issues… there were probably a lot of reasons that it would benefit them to do so.</p><p>On the other hand, if she had <em> not</em> been placed, she would have been a young girl with good education but few practical skills, traumatised and alone, and a long way from everything she knew.</p><p>Or it could have been a mix of the two or anything in between.</p><p>Or maybe she just wanted to be an actress. Granted, she didn't seem too enthused about the job now but maybe she had when she started.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We all boarded the ship just after dawn, and by the time the light had saturated the harbour we were moving. I'm not much of a boat person, so I didn't know too much about the ship itself. It had two masts, above and below decks as well as a front and rear cabins (fore and aft? Something like that anyway). It was fairly crowded on board, with the ship crew, film crew, actors and all the props and scenery that had to be brought with us…</p><p>Initially, it wasn't too bad, as everyone hung about on the deck watching as we left the port. There was oohing and ahhing about finally going out to sea, and how everything looked and passing ships and so forth. But by mid morning, the deck was a hive of activity. Apparently, there was filming to be done while on the ship, not just in the Land of Snow.</p><p>I leant over the railings, half to keep myself out of the way, and half because I was starting to feel <em> really</em> queasy. Before, I'd had a severe case of motion sickness that had been the bane of my childhood. Car trips of over half an hour could make me sick and buses were even worse. That had gotten better with age, but the real horror, and the one I'd never got over, had been boats.</p><p>I hadn't even considered that that might have followed me here. I'd never had cause to step on a boat before apart from a very brief and quiet trip to the Land of Waves. Given that this <em> wasn't even</em> <em> the same body</em> it was just blatantly unfair.</p><p>The cold air helped some, but I foresaw a miserable week ahead of me.</p><p>It was a shame, because there was so much interesting stuff going on. The most I knew about filming came from the extra's on DVD's. I would have liked to find out more.</p><p>"Not going to watch the filming?" Sasuke asked, leaning next to me.</p><p>"Maybe later," I said. "Naruto's over there, anyway, if anything happens."</p><p>Yukie had been most displeased to find herself waking up on a boat, and the hangover probably didn't help much either. She seemed to be coldly resigned to it now, though we hadn't been able to corner her and talk to her. I thought it would probably be wise to give Sandayuu a chance first, before we tried to convince her.</p><p>He hesitated, dark eyes watching me. "Do you think she'll do it?" He asked instead. It wasn't what he had been <em> going</em> to say, but I didn't push.</p><p>"Hard to say," I replied. "We haven't really talked to her about <em> why</em> so we don't have much information. But," I shrugged on shoulder. "Naruto's proven to be pretty good at talking people into things in the past."</p><p>Sasuke snorted. "I guess that's true." He looked over at where Naruto and Kakashi-sensei were standing. "Things are going to be different now, aren't they?"</p><p>"Because Naruto got promoted?" I guessed. "Maybe. But things are always changing. Look at how much we've changed since graduation." I made a listless gesture with my hand, trying to encompass us all. "The team will work how the team works. I don't think Naruto getting a flack jacket will change all <em> that </em> much. Maybe if Kakashi-sensei weren't here…" I shrugged. Technically, if Kakashi-sensei weren't here, or if we split up into groups, Naruto would be in charge. Only time would tell if that was going to be an issue. I didn't think it would be, but who knew?</p><p>Sasuke made a noncommittal sound. "It's not…" he said slowly. "It's not really about the promotion…"</p><p>"It's that he's grown so strong, so fast?" I finished.</p><p>His shoulders hunched forward, just a little. He looked… a little ashamed. Maybe because he was jealous, or maybe because he felt he hadn't.</p><p>"So have you," I pointed out gently. "Sharingan, Chidori, your taijutsu… you've come a long way. It's just hard to see in yourself."</p><p>"I guess," he said, which didn't tell me if he believed me or not. Still, it was better than outright rejection and hostility and I don't think he was really upset at Naruto. It was just that for every battle we won there seemed to be another where we got slapped down by opponents well above our skill level and he was frustrated. Thinking about it, Naruto had come out of those fights better off than the rest of us, even managing to beat Gaara.</p><p>That probably contributed a lot.</p><p>I sighed. "Do you think they'll mind if I jump down and run on the water?" I asked, changing the subject.</p><p>He blinked. "What?"</p><p>"It's just the rocking…" I waved my hand and grimaced."You're seasick," he said, dawning realisation. "I could ask Kakashi-sensei," he said after a pause. "See what he says."</p><p>"Thanks," I said quietly.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei wandered over casually in his 'I'm only moving in this direction because I feel like it' manner after Sasuke spoke with him.</p><p>"Alright?" He asked, pressing the backs of his fingers to my forehead in a very parental temperature check. It was a legitimate way to check for fever, of course, but it still amused me.</p><p>"Just wondered if they'd kick up a fuss if I went over the side," I said. Probably best not to give the crew heart attacks by just diving off the edge without warning. Civilians generally weren't used to people capable of running over water.</p><p>"Should be fine," Sensei said, shrugging and opening his book in a way that said he really didn't care what they thought. "Just don't stray too far from the ship."</p><p>I was crouched on the railings, just about to jump off when he spoke again.</p><p>"Oh. And watch out for the sharks." His one visible eye crinkled into a smile.</p><p>I rolled my eyes and jumped, landing without a splash, but with a fairly decent sized ripple. Once, like anyone else who'd seen Jaws, that warning would have freaked me out. But when you were a chakra powered ninja, local wildlife wasn't the threat it used to be. Oh, sure, if you were injured, low on chakra or taken by surprise you might be in trouble, or if it was a particularly vicious species like those that lived in the Forest of Death but in general it wasn't something to consider.</p><p>Sharks, for instance, were deadly to humans because we lacked manoeuvrability in the water and could neither escape nor avoid them. When you were capable of removing yourself from their kingdom simply by <em> standing on top of it</em> , that ceased to be an issue.</p><p>That didn't mean I <em> didn't</em> keep an eye out, but I wasn't going to mention that.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Night time brought it's own difficulties. I'd already noticed that there were a lot of people on board and not very much space, a fact which was highlighted when it came to finding somewhere to sleep. There were a few cabins - Yukie got a private one - but not enough for everyone. Those of importance got the beds, while the rest of us were given canvas hammocks to string up below decks.</p><p>"We actually get the better deal," one of the sailors confided. "The hammocks move in concert with the ship, so you don't get thrown out like you sometimes do with berths or the pipe racks. If you hang them properly, they'll cocoon around you, so it's not cold either."</p><p>I really had no idea what he was talking about, but I nodded anyway. It was nice of him to say so.</p><p>"I think it's kind of neat. Maybe we should put hammocks on our equipment list." It would probably work in Fire Country, what with the huge forests everywhere, though maybe not everywhere else.</p><p>"In some places it is," Kakashi-sensei said. "Like if you're headed to Land of Rainforests, they have a huge range of biting insects - fire ants, that kind of thing - and you're advised <em> not</em> to sleep on the ground. That necessitates people getting, ah… inventive with their sleeping arrangements. In ANBU, I had one team mate who would rig himself an ankle snare and hang from a tree branch. We got ambushed once, and they thought he was our prisoner and tried to get him down. It gave us time to deal with them." He shrugged and scratched his cheek. "He was a little weird."</p><p>Setting aside the issues with sleeping upside down, like blood flow to the head, it was a funny story. Something I could see a ninja potentially doing.</p><p>Naruto apparently thought so, because he latched onto Kakashi-sensei and stared up at him. "I bet you have a lot of cool stories to tell, ne Kaka-sensei?" he asked. "Tell us another one. Please?"</p><p>I snickered. "Now you've done it. You let Naruto know you've done interesting things. He's never going to leave you alone now."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei looked a little flustered and pushed Naruto back onto his hammock, which promptly spun around and dumped him on the floor.</p><p>Sasuke rolled his eyes. "You didn't tie it tightly enough," he said, getting up to help.</p><p>"Personally," I continued. "I kinda want to hear the one Gai-sensei mentioned about you cutting a lightning bolt in half. That sounds epic."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei shrugged. "Ah, it's probably not as great as you were thinking."</p><p>But even Sasuke was giving him an interested look.</p><p>He sighed. "I was fighting a ninja from the Storm Squad, that's a Hidden Cloud ninja that uses storms to boost their lightning jutsu," he clarified. "I was attacking her with Chidori when she called a lightning strike down. Our jutsu clashed and mine won." He shrugged. "That's it."</p><p>Short, but I could picture it happening - Kakashi-sensei with Sharingan eye spinning leaping forward, chidori crackling, under the dark and stormy sky, at a lady, standing tall, hand raised to call the lightning down… the clash of lightning versus lightning…</p><p>"Still sounds pretty epic," I decided.</p><p>"So cool," Naruto breathed, eyes shining.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei looked half amused, half exasperated. "Well, if you really want a story," he said slyly. "I'll read you one by a real <em> master.</em> " He whipped out his orange book.</p><p>"No!" Naruto shrieked, hands clapping over his ears. "I don't wanna hear it!"</p><p>I couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Snow Arc: Chapter 48</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: 1000 reviews? You guys rock.</p><p>Valerie - I don't wanna give away too much about that. It's certainly going to be <em> different</em> , so there's no need to feel disappointed. And, well, yes. I kind of do like making fun of Kakashi. XD In the best possible way, of course.</p><p>NobodyInParticular - Yeah, I kinda assumed it would come up in one training session or another. It just seems to be one of those <em> things.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 48</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. ~ Ronald Reagan</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Your turn to convince me, is it?" Yukie muttered as I landed on the deck next to her. The ship crew had mostly gotten used to us jumping on and off the ship at whim and climbing up the mast and rigging without a safety harness.</p><p>"Would you like me too?" I asked practically. She hadn't listened to Sandayuu and he probably had a better understanding of the situation than the rest of us.</p><p>Didn't mean I wasn't going to <em> try</em> , just meant that the obvious route wasn't the one I was going to use.</p><p>She snorted. "It doesn't matter. Whatever you say, whatever you do, it wont matter in the end. You'll see."</p><p>"Why wont it matter?" I asked idly, leaning on the railings. I took out a kunai and flipped it, end over end, like I used to do with pens. Only, then I'd been more likely to drop it or catch the wrong end, and now I could do it with barely a thought. Hand eye coordination, muscle control, whatever it was that made the difference.</p><p>She lifted her chin. "You know the story. You heard what he did. He isn't a man that can be beaten."</p><p>"Everyone can be beaten," I said, because it was true. There was <em> always</em> someone stronger out there. It didn't do to forget that. "It's just a matter of finding out how. Why does he scare you so much?"</p><p>Because she <em> was.</em> So scared that she'd avoid an entire country, would drop her name and past… so very, very scared.</p><p>Her breath caught, jerkily. Then she laughed mockingly. "He killed my father himself, did you know that?" her voice hissed out, almost venomously. "I saw it. He just struck him down like it was <em> nothing</em> . The castle was burning, everyone was screaming… You can't possibly <em> imagine…</em> " she scoffed. "And you ask me why I'm scared."</p><p>I considered my kunai for a second. It was… well, fair enough reasoning I guess. But by all accounts, her father had been untrained in any sort of fighting ability. Didn't make it any less terrifying to a child's eyes, of course, and the impression of <em> power</em> was a lasting one.</p><p>"We can probably imagine better than you think," I said evenly. I'd been on the other side, getting struck down. But even Itachi Uchiha wasn't invincible… just <em> almost.</em> <em> Kyuubi</em> wasn't invincible, either, or he never would have been sealed. "But that kind of fear… you can't run away from it. It followed you this far, and it'll keep following you for a good long time. Even if we never go to Snow Country… that fear is still going to be there."</p><p>"And if we go there, we'll die," she retorted. "This isn't a movie. The hero doesn't win. There are no happy endings just because you <em> try.</em> "</p><p>"No happy endings?" I echoed. "There are no endings at all. Things keep going. Day after day. If you want happiness, you have to make it happen. If yesterday didn't go your way, plan today and make tomorrow better." I shrugged one shoulder. "You've got to make a decision sometime, princess. Running only helps when you've got somewhere to go."</p><p>She turned away and left. I let her. That conversation wasn't really going anywhere.</p><p>The problem with Yukie was that she was lashing out blindly, with no real idea of what she wanted or didn't want. She was bitter, angry and afraid … and lost and confused. She had no goals, nothing to keep her moving on, nothing to aim for. Frankly, I was surprised that she'd managed to come this far, and it probably said more about the people around her than it did about her personally.</p><p>"What a mess," I said out loud. Maybe Naruto's personal brand of 'I don't care, I'll make it happen' would get through to her. Heck, maybe Sasuke could sympathise over their similar circumstances. Not that I expected Sasuke to share that, actually.</p><p>Things would go much more smoothly if she cooperated. You couldn't crown an unwilling queen.</p><p>Well, I reconsidered, you probably could. But it certainly wouldn't be a nice situation for anyone involved, and it really wasn't an outcome that I was looking forward too.</p><p>That second day on the water blurred into the third, and the weather started getting colder.</p><p>"There's so much empty space out here," Naruto said, standing on top the horizontal post of the mast. "I didn't realise just how ..." He gestured.</p><p>I stood beside him, cloak billowing dramatically in the wind, but failing to fulfil it's actual role in keeping me warm. "Just you, me and the wide blue sea," I singsonged.</p><p>"It's like you could keep sailing <em> forever,</em> " he said, a little in awe of the sheer <em> freedom</em> of it.</p><p>I grinned. "Going to give up being a ninja to become a pirate?" I teased. "Kakashi-sensei already has an eye patch, and I think Sasuke would look spiffing in the hat, so me and you get to fight it out for the peg leg and hook hand."</p><p>Not that I would be particularly enthused about such a thing. This was a smooth and quiet trip and I <em> still</em> couldn't wait to get to land. If there had been any kind of storm… you could forget it.</p><p>Naruto laughed. "I'll never give up being a ninja," he said. "Not even to be a pirate."</p><p>"Didn't think you would," I admitted. "Have you talked to Yukie?"</p><p>"Yeah," he said with a sigh. "Even <em> Sasuke</em> has tried to talk to her. But I don't think she was even <em> listening</em> to me."</p><p>Sasuke had tried? Maybe I should ask him how it went.</p><p>"Maybe she'll change her mind once we actually get there." I shrugged. "You know, see the place, see the people and all that."</p><p>"I'll keep trying, anyway," Naruto said, determined.</p><p>I smirked. "You do that," I said before leaning back, past the point of balance, feeling gravity snag me, and cut the chakra to my feet. I fell and flipped over gracefully in the air, landing lightly on the deck. So it might have been a needlessly showy way of getting down, but it was fast, and sometimes, when you <em> could</em> do something like that, you just had to.</p><p>Sasuke was perched at the back of the ship, feet dangling over the sides and staring out at the water. Given that there was only so much space on the ship, trying to find a place to sit by yourself took a bit of skill.</p><p>"Hey," I said, dropping down next to him. "Heard you've been talking to Yukie."</p><p>He snorted. "I don't think talking is the right way to put it."</p><p>"That bad, huh?" I asked.</p><p>"I can't understand," Sasuke said softly, looking away. "How can she just… let him get away with it?"</p><p>I considered it. "Because it's easier than trying to fight? Because he's strong and in power and she's just one girl? Because she's scared? Because no one else did anything?" I shrugged. I was only guessing, but they were reasons.</p><p>He snorted. "If he's stronger, then you just need to work harder. If no one else will do it then you do it yourself."</p><p>I wondered if we were even talking about Yukie anymore.</p><p>I bumped my shoulder against his. "Or you find people like the amazing Team 7 to help you."</p><p>He smirked. "I guess that works too."</p><p>By late afternoon we were starting to pass small icefloes, and the next morning there were icebergs. One of them, a gigantic ice <em> shelf</em> right smack bang in our path.</p><p>"We'll have to go right around it," the captain said. "There's no telling how big that thing is underneath the water."</p><p>Yeah, we really didn't want to run into it Titanic style.</p><p>The Director stared at it for a long moment. "It's perfect!" He enthused. "It's the ideal location. We'll film here!"</p><p>Several people stared at him.</p><p>"Are you… sure?" the ship captain asked slowly.</p><p>"When the god of movies arrives you don't ask 'are you sure?'" he scoffed. "You have to take the chances that are given! Everyone, get ready to land!"</p><p>The captain turned away, shaking his head. I caught a mutter of 'crazy old nutters' but he did turn the ship to land on the iceberg itself.</p><p>It took sometime to get everyone organised, and the props together and the actors up to date on which scenes they were filming. There was a lot of equipment that had to be offloaded, and people were scurrying around everywhere. But there were heaters set up, so it wasn't completely unbearable.</p><p>The Director was seated in his foldable camp chair, which I was starting to notice he never went anywhere <em> without</em> , smoking on his long pipe and surveying the set up like a king to his kingdom.</p><p>I snorted in amusement at the thought and turned back to surveying the iceberg. It was flat on this side, with a rising cliff at the back, with huge spires jutting out of the ground. I couldn't see why this was any better location than what probably awaited us at the Land of Snow, but what did I know?</p><p>They were halfway through filming the first scene when I felt it. I jerked my head up in surprise.</p><p>We were in the middle of the freaking ocean. How the hell were there other ninja here?</p><p>"Sensei?" I whispered urgently. "Three chakra signals just landed on the ice. The other side of that cliff." Given the way the iceshelf was formed, we couldn't see the other side of it. If there was a boat, or if they'd run from a nearby location…</p><p>His eye widened, just a fraction, before scanning the surroundings. I had no doubt he would have noticed them too, because a second later he nodded. "Hidden Snow ninja, I expect. We'll see what they want." He looked at us all seriously. "If it comes down to fighting, your job is to protect the princess and make sure that everyone gets onto the boat."</p><p>We nodded, firmly.</p><p>They could have been scouting. Spying to see what we were up to. They could have been there for a lot of reasons. But it was safest to assume they were probably after the princess.</p><p>We spread out, moving away from the heaters to cover all the directions. I knew where the chakra was, but you should never get sloppy, because <em> that</em> was when there would be a secret attack from the direction you didn't cover.</p><p>The chakra itself was … odd. I would have almost said it had two <em> layers</em> but that was even more mystifying. How could chakra be layered? Some special jutsu or technique was more likely then.</p><p>They knew we were here. And we knew they were here. Now it was just a matter of who made the first move.</p><p>It was them, of course. Body guarding was mostly reactionary. You protected and you deflected, but you didn't usually go out of your way to strike at a threat.</p><p>On some cue that we neither saw nor heard, the three of them appeared in the open. They weren't <em> close</em> , not yet, but they had taken the high ground where they could attack easily from.</p><p>We darted into action, repositioning ourselves in front of the group. Kakashi-sensei took point, stepping out in front of the actors, facing a man with long blue hair. The leader, probably.</p><p>"Get back," Sensei said gruffly, and the actors wasted no time following his suggestion, scurrying out of the way.</p><p>"Welcome to the Land of Snow," the first ninja said. There was a mocking lit to his voice but at least we were starting with dialogue. That was a good sign.</p><p>"We welcome you, Princess Koyuki," the second said, a female with pink hair. At first glance, she appeared to be wearing a pale blue cheongsam but it appeared remarkably <em> solid</em> looking.</p><p><em> Sakura will be pleased to hear she isn't the only one with hair like that,</em> I thought idly.</p><p>"Do you have the Hexagonal Crystal?" she asked.</p><p>I had no idea what a Hexagonal Crystal was, or why she thought Yukie would have it but it seemed they <em> were </em> here for Yukie in some form or another.</p><p>Yukie didn't say anything. In fact, she was looking remarkably weak kneed. Under the heavy stage makeup, she was incredibly pale.</p><p>"Get everyone back on the boat," Kakashi-sensei ordered in a low voice. He didn't take his eyes off the enemy ninja, but I could tell he was slightly worried. Depending on how willing they were to hurt random people, having the civilians here could hamper us enormously.</p><p>We nodded, dropping back a step to usher the crew away. Naruto brought out several dozen shadow clones to help move them off, which let us keep an eye on the enemies.</p><p>"Are you going to run away again, Kakashi Hatake?" the leader called tauntingly. "Like last time?"</p><p>They knew each other. Well. That could either be good or bad. There were a lot reasons that someone might disengage from a fight, because they were losing, because their objective was to <em> get away</em> , or simply because they gained nothing from fighting. He was attempting to imply it was the first, of course, but it might not be so.</p><p>And even if it was, well, losing a fight could still gain you valuable information for the rematch.</p><p>"Nadare Rouga," Sensei replied, identifying the man. He offered no other response though.</p><p>"Fubuki, Mizore," Nadare ordered, after the silence drew out for a few more seconds. "Get the Princess."</p><p>They leapt down from their positions, heading for us. I cast an eye around the crowd looking for their target, and found her. Struggling weakly against one of Naruto's clones and <em> not</em> heading back to the boat.</p><p>"No, no," she was whimpering. She looked <em> terrified.</em> I would have felt sorry for her, if she wasn't just putting herself in more danger.</p><p>Sasuke intercepted the second man - Mizore - with a barrage of kunai, only to have them and his fuuma shuriken <em> shatter</em> against his metal arm coverings.</p><p><em> Note to self; Don't get hit with that.</em></p><p>I intercepted the woman while Naruto went for Yukie, to try and get her moving. So far, everyone else was moving fine, and the other clones were herding everyone successfully back to the ship. The Hidden Snow ninja didn't seem interested in them at all, which was good.</p><p>"Don't worry," I heard him say. "I'll protect you, princess, just like in the movies." Hopefully he'd get her moving, even if he had to carry her.</p><p>My thrown kunai were batted away contemptuously and Fubuki raced through a quick hand seal.</p><p>"Ice Release: Swallow Snow Storm Jutsu!" she cried.</p><p><em> Ice?</em> I thought, then had to twist sharply and flip away as dozens of bird shaped ice needles flew towards me. I evaded, darting away, and they curved through the air following me. <em> Oh, that's not fair. </em> It wasn't just a straight line jutsu, then. It was controllable.</p><p>I couldn't bring up an earth wall, because there was no earth. I rolled again, underneath the jutsu and tried to keep an eye on her. If she kept me occupied with dodging this, then she had a free line to the Princess. It had a fairly wide turn radius and had to arc around, and I was plotting how I needed to move to force it to dive into the ice and when I ducked and found that I crossed paths with Sasuke. We shared a look, instant battlefield communication and switched opponents.</p><p>"Fire Release: Great Fireball Jutsu!" he called, breathing out and blasting the ice with fire. There was a sizzling sound of ice melting, and a gust of hot air blew across my back.</p><p>I took a moment to assess my new opponent. Tall, thickly built. Heavy metal amour capable of shattering weaponry on his arms. I didn't want to get in close. He was moving fast, some kind of snowboard stuck to his feet.</p><p>I threw an explosive note in his path, disturbing the ice and knocking him from his board. He tumbled backwards from the force of it, but it hadn't been strong enough to damage him.</p><p>I spent the time he was down gathering the chakra, and he was only just back on his feet by the time I was ready. "Lightning Release: Striking Bolt!" Electricity leapt from my fingers, flying across the space between us. Ice didn't conduct electricity the same way water did, but it didn't hamper it either. That was good enough for me.</p><p>But the lightning bolt seemed to strike something <em> before</em> it hit him, fizzling out in thin air.</p><p><em> Not good.</em></p><p>He charged straight through the lightning, not even fazed by it. I dodged the first heavy punch, from an arm that looked like it had a cannon welded to it, and it shattered the ice where it landed. I flipped out of the way, not wanting to fight on unstable ground, hands running through the seals for a genjutsu, only to find that it had no effect.</p><p><em> The hell?</em></p><p>It wasn't unusual for a ninja to be unaffected by genjutsu. Even if you did get them, a simple 'Kai' was enough to break it, unless the caster was <em> really</em> good. I wasn't. But. But. That double layered chakra had <em> flared, </em> when my genjutsu failed. Probably when my lightning jutsu had failed, too.</p><p><em> Okay. So?</em> It meant something. The trouble was working out what.</p><p>I lashed out with my shadow, intending to snare him the second he was in close enough. He either didn't see it or didn't care, because he didn't even try to dodge. I found out why the instant I connected.</p><p>I <em> staggered.</em></p><p>It was draining my chakra at an alarming rate. I cut the connection, dropping the jutsu as fast as I could. It hadn't even made him <em> pause.</em></p><p>My heart was pounding from the sudden surge and I could hear it thundering in my ears. I was gulping air and my throat <em> burned</em> from dryness and the absolutely frigid temperature.</p><p>There was a burst of heat and light behind us, as Sasuke used another fire jutsu. It was difficult keeping track of how his fight was going while still paying attention to my own, just in case we needed to switch again or <em> they</em> switched, or I needed to dodge something… Sensei was somewhere up above us, fighting Nadare.</p><p>I ducked under an attack, aware that I was fighting on the defensive and not liking it, and rolled across the ice again, slapping an explosive tag on the ice and got free, just before it blew, sending chunks of ice and steam into the air.</p><p>I wasn't out of options, not by a long shot, but I <em> was </em> cautious. There was some kind of absorbing property to their armour, most likely. It certainly had drained my of chakra when I had established an open connection between us. Genjutsu was ineffective. Ninjutsu was … limited.</p><p>I hadn't tried Taijutsu, but he was obviously able to <em> dish out</em> the damage and I wasn't sure I wanted to get in range of that. I'd been lucky so far, but he was faster than he seemed.</p><p>Something blurred at me out of the steam thrown up by the explosive tag. I blocked it with two kunai crossed together, prepared for sudden force, only to find them entangled in some kind of sticky string, fingers and all.</p><p><em> Shit.</em></p><p>I rolled as well as I could without stabbing myself, as a heavily armoured leg scythed through the air where I had just been. I needed to get some distance and get my hands free.</p><p>"Hey!" someone shouted and an orange blur roared past me, slamming full body into Mizore. Naruto.</p><p>I took the opportunity given and twisted the kunai around to free my hands. The string wasn't strong, and it cut easily now that I had a second to <em> try.</em></p><p>I glanced up, taking a brief snapshot look at the other fights. Their was ice prisms pulled up in lines around Sasuke and smoke billowing into the air. Fubuki was … flying? There were wings stretched out on her back.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei and Nadare were further away. I was glad of that, because even as I watched, a huge whale made of ice burst forth and slammed down where Sensei had been. I felt a brief flash of worry, but his chakra was still strong, and of all of us, he was probably in the least danger.</p><p>The civilians were back on the boat, or almost. <em> Good</em> .</p><p>I blinked back to my fight and leapt forward with a sweeping low kick even as Naruto attacked high. We hit in tandem, blows raining down on surprisingly tough armour. But it wasn't negating them the same way it had my jutsu earlier.</p><p><em> Taijutsu, then.</em></p><p>But it was tricky. There was solid metal on his arms and shoulders and he was thickset and strong underneath that. The part of our hits that the armour didn't absorb hardly seemed to affect him at all.</p><p>It took only the briefest of missteps and Naruto took that solid metal arm straight to the chest. He <em> flew</em> backwards, slamming into the ice wall, slamming<em> through it</em> , disappearing from my sight.</p><p><em> Ouch. That had to hurt.</em></p><p>"Naruto!" Kakashi-sensei shouted, and it sounded slightly panicked.</p><p>I rebounded high off a spire, and lashed out, foot catching Mizore straight in the face, with as much force as I could manage. He stumbled.</p><p>I didn't back off, touching down and leaping back up into the air with a single quick movement before stomping <em> down.</em> The face makes a good target, sometimes. It's packed with sensitive nerves, delicate organs, and breakable cartilage. No one likes being hit in the face. I stomped down, again and again, using the downwards force to lift my other leg back up for the next kick.</p><p>Cascading Heaven Kick, it's called, if you're in to knowing the names of Taijutsu attacks, and it's hell on the thighs. Not exactly safe or stable, either, but if the circumstances are right, it works.</p><p>He reached up blindly, trying to grab my feet and throw me off and I decided it was enough, planting both feet firmly and flipping off. He slammed into the ground, blood gushing from what looked to be a horrifically broken nose. He was a ninja though, and it would take more than that to stop him.</p><p>"Everyone get to the boat!" Sensei shouted. Since the civilians were already there, I assumed he was talking to us.</p><p>Mizore was down but not out yet. He was staggering back to his feet. I chanced looking away for a second and found Naruto pulling himself out of the ice that he'd slammed into.</p><p>I darted towards him and grabbed his arm. "Come on!"</p><p>He nodded. I checked on Sasuke as we ran, and found him sending a parting fireball to Fubuki. It passed underneath her, but the sudden warm air currents made her spiral erratically about. It wasn't enough to take her out, but it gave him a second to disengage and head for the boat.</p><p>I felt the huge surge of chakra and checked over my shoulder to see <em> two</em> of the giant ice whales rising out of the ice.</p><p>"Faster is better," I decided, nervously. I was pretty sure that Kakashi-sensei had a plan to get us out of here, since he'd called the retreat and all. I just wasn't sure I was going to <em> like</em> it.</p><p>Naruto checked over his shoulder and almost stumbled. I shoved him along.</p><p>We barely made it to the boat before the two of them crashed into each other, then into the iceberg itself. There was a horrible rending crash and the water surged furiously, violent waves and swells battering us away from the iceberg. The boat listed and tilted and tilted back the other way. People started screaming, clinging to whatever stable surface was available. There hadn't been time to load things properly or tie them down and crates slid across the deck, clattering and clanging. More than one went off the side.</p><p>I really thought we were going to capsize.</p><p>"Well, that was interesting," Kakashi-sensei said, sliding his headband back down over his Sharingan and leaning heavily on the cabin wall.</p><p><hr /></p><p>… because Sasuke needs a hat to go with his gay pirate outfit. You <em> know</em> what I'm talking about.</p><p>Heavenly Cascading Kick (Tenro Kyaku) - some of you might recognise from Kasumi out of Dead or Alive. Just a little shout out there.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Snow Arc: Chapter 49</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: So I took one throw away line by the actors at the start of the movie and spun it into a plot explaining why ANBU Kakashi was there and just why he decided to switcheroo the crystal. Since, y'know, that never got explained.</p><p>Anemos - Thanks for reviewing! The chakra armour has a pretty high threshold, since the only jutsu that really damage it are Chidori and Rasengan. Konjirushi? Is that a translation of something? The sealing will show up more eventually, but it's a new skill that she hasn't mastered yet, which is me trying to bring in a little realism instead of 'one training session and I mastered it'.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 49</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Man can live about forty days without food, about three days without water, about eight minutes without air, but only for one second without hope ~ Anonymous </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The ship rocked violently underfoot and I stared at the chaos on board, feeling completely exhausted. My chakra levels were lower than I expected, having been drained by that usurped shadow jutsu.</p><p>I wasn't the only one fighting chakra exhaustion, either. Kakashi-sensei's chakra levels were low and flickering and he was leaning heavily against the wall.</p><p><em> Just what we need.</em></p><p>"Let's go inside," Kakashi-sensei murmured. "I suspect people are going to want an explanation for what just happened."</p><p>"Shouldn't we… keep watch?" I asked hesitantly. We weren't all that far away from the iceberg, after all, and an attack while we were on the boat could be devastating.</p><p>"They won't be ready for a round two quite so soon," Sensei said. "That much I don't think has changed." He caught my confused look. "I'll explain in a minute."</p><p>One of the cabins on the upper deck was a sort of dining/meeting room, with a long table surrounded by chairs and benches. We tucked ourselves away in there.</p><p>"Are you alright, Kaka-sensei?" Naruto asked, frowning.</p><p>"Ah, I just used too much chakra," Kakashi-sensei said with a grimace. He flicked a glance at Sasuke. "Let that be a warning against using techniques you just copied; sometimes they take more out of you than you think."</p><p>Sasuke nodded shortly. After having copied and used Lee's taijutsu without having undergone the training to build the muscle necessary for it he'd probably already discovered that.</p><p>"You said they wouldn't be attacking again so soon," I prompted.</p><p>"Right," Sensei exhaled. "The explanation for that starts with the chakra armour."</p><p>"Chakra armour?" Naruto repeated, puzzled.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei nodded. "The Land of Snow is one of the few places that is known to have mines with chakra conductive metal. Normally, metal like that is very rare and expensive, and only the very best ninja or clans will be have weapons made out of chakra conductive metal. However, Hidden Snow have complete control over the mines in Snow Country, which gives them access to a very large amount of it. They use this to make their armour, which has special properties."</p><p>"Chakra absorption," I said. "It completely negated Genjutsu… and Ninjutsu …"</p><p>It was possible there was an upper limit for what it could absorb, meaning higher ranked jutsu would still work, if weaker than normal. It was also possible that the environmental effects of jutsu still had power - Fubuki had been affected by the <em> heat</em> from Sasuke's fire jutsu.</p><p>"Right," Kakashi-sensei confirmed. "They use the armour to absorb and nullify any chakra that you use against them. It can work as a barrier around the body to protect them, and they can use it to strengthen their own techniques."</p><p>"That's why when you copied it…" Sasuke said. There was a faint crease of a frown between his eyes.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei nodded.</p><p>"About that," Naruto said, frowning. "I thought that ice was like… a Bloodlimit. That's what Haku had, right?"</p><p>"You probably didn't notice because you were busy fighting, but the jutsu that the Snow ninja used were more like earth jutsu than what Haku used. He created ice out of nothing, while they were just manipulating the ice that was already present. That kind of thing is much easier. The second reason is that their armour helps them, though I don't know how. That kind of knowledge is heavily guarded."</p><p>It must have offset the chakra cost or <em> something</em> because they'd been throwing those jutsu around pretty easily.</p><p>"The other thing I know is that the armour works best in the Land of Snow itself." Sensei shrugged. "It's one of the reasons they're not more of a danger. It's possible that they need to recharge or repair the armour frequently, because they're unable to participate in drawn out battles or launch follow up attacks, even when that would be the best option."</p><p>"So they're going to be even stronger when we get to Snow Country?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"I don't know," Kakashi-sensei admitted. "They've clearly been improving since the last time I was here. At the very least, they would be able to recover faster."</p><p>Well, that wasn't really good news. But then, being able to have full, up to date information on your enemies was a very rare situation indeed. We had <em> something</em> which was better than nothing.</p><p>"What's a Hexagonal Crystal?" I asked suddenly, remembering what Fubuki had asked Yukie for.</p><p>"That… is a good question." Kakashi-sensei stared at the wall for a long second. "I really shouldn't be telling you this, but it might be relevant to the current situation. Just keep quiet about it, okay?"</p><p>We nodded.</p><p>"I came here ten years ago as part of an ANBU reconnaissance group. There were rumours that the Daimyo was building and inventing battle puppets… chakra armour… all kinds of things. They were unsubstantiated, but obviously rumours like that worry Hidden Villages, even those as far from here as Konoha. Unfortunately, while we were here, Dotou attacked, so we were never able to fully investigate." His voice was impassive, but he was leaving out large portions of the story, which indicated that it wasn't nearly as straight forward as he was saying.</p><p>That explained where he had met Nadare, anyway, and how he knew so much about the chakra armour itself.</p><p>"We <em> did</em> find a location that was locked with an odd key. Hexagonal in shape, probably very dense in nature. Crystal, if I had to guess. We had no time to attempt to open it, or to search for the key, so I don't know what was there…"</p><p>"But it's what Dotou is looking for now," Sasuke finished, trading glances with Naruto.</p><p>I wasn't entirely sure that giving a child the secret key to … whatever it was, was the safest of choices, and it seemed like it was a plot that really belonged on the <em> other</em> side of the silver screen. Assuming she even had it, and it wasn't a mistake on their behalf.</p><p>"Well, we're already supposed to be protecting the princess," I said. Protecting her because of what she had wasn't any different.</p><p>"True enough," Kakashi-sensei agreed easily.</p><p>Any further conversation was cut off as the door opened and Sandayuu's head poked in. "Ah," he said. "There you are. The Director is asking…"</p><p>"Yes, I suppose we have to have a meeting," Kakashi-sensei said neutrally.</p><p>He disappeared and soon the small room was far too crowded, with the Director and his second occupying the other side of the table. The acrid smoke from the Directors pipe began to slowly fill the room. I resisted the urge to wrinkle my nose.</p><p>"Yukie isn't joining us?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"She's in her cabin," Sandayuu said. "She is…. Unwell."</p><p>Considering her reaction during the fighting, that might have been an understatement.</p><p>"I apologise for the deception," Sandayuu began, bowing slightly in his seat. "But what I have done has been for Snow Country." Quickly, he filled the other two in on the situation. They were… less shocked than they probably would have been before the whole 'attacked by enemy ninja' thing.</p><p>The Director puffed on his pipe silently for a few minutes. "To film a movie using a real princess… that is something that happens once in a lifetime."</p><p><em> Priorities,</em> I thought wryly. You were far too into your job if the threat of death and danger didn't faze you. Then again, with what my 'job' was, I didn't exactly have room to talk.</p><p>"Oh, I see," the Assistant Director said enthusiastically. "This movie will be a real hit and we'll make big bucks!"</p><p>"Thank you," Sandayuu said, sighing in relief. "I am grateful, truly."</p><p>My attention was distracted by the feeling of someone approaching the cabin door. If I listened carefully, I could even hear the padding of bare feet on the wooden floor. Yukie, most probably.</p><p>The door slid open, confirming my guess.</p><p>"Princess! I'm glad to see that you're alright," Sandayuu exclaimed. "The Director has been appraised of the situation and he agrees -"</p><p>"I won't go back to Snow Country," she cut him off, voice flat and lifeless. "I won't."</p><p>"Unfortunately," Kakashi-sensei cut in. "Hiding is no longer an option. Dotou has discovered you. He won't let you be until he has what he wants."</p><p>"We'll protect you," Naruto said earnestly. "You don't have to worry about a thing."</p><p>She snorted. "Just give it up already. No matter how hard you try, you can't beat Dotou."</p><p><em> You can't beat Gatou, he's too strong!</em></p><p>That did sound awfully familiar, didn't it? Even the names were similar.</p><p>"Lady, you don't know <em> what</em> we can do," Naruto said, indignantly. "You can't just say 'give up' so easily. If he's strong, we'll just get stronger! That's all there is to it!"</p><p>"Because you wont give up, you will live to see a dream," the Director said thoughtfully. "Because you are able to see a dream, the future will come. This is nice. What a perfect theme for the final chapter of the Unlucky Princess."</p><p>"Wait a minute!" Yukie said. "You can't-"</p><p>"Let's make a movie with a happy ending!" The Assistant Director cheered.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We were actually closer to the Land of Snow than I expected. If we hadn't landed on the ice berg and then subsequently been blown of course, we would have landed within the day. As it was, we were expected to dock by mid morning.</p><p>I leant on the rails of the bow - the front pointy bit - and watched the incoming land eagerly. Oh, sure, it would lead to fighting and enemy ninja and possibly a civil war, but at least it was solid ground.</p><p>Yup, I was in a good mood.</p><p>No more seasickness and maybe I'd finally be able to get the half remembered chords from the Titanic song out of my head.</p><p>"<em> Near, far, wherever you are,</em> " I sang softly. "<em> I believe that the heart will go on…"</em></p><p>I grimaced. It just didn't sound the same after translation. Not that I could remember all the words anyway, but that was one of those songs that seemed to stick with you. I did remember, one school field trip, we'd had to take a ferry somewhere. Being teenagers and on a boat, we'd amused and/or irritated the other passengers by singing that pretty much the whole way.</p><p>My smile faded and I wished I hadn't thought of that. We had enough killjoys on this boat without me ruining my <em> own</em> good mood.</p><p>Yukie had been… difficult, ever since that conversation. The only saving grace was that there was literally nowhere she could go, otherwise I was sure she would have tried to run away again.</p><p>Thankfully, there were no problems docking. The portside town was very small, but they had ready for us a convey of trucks and caravans. I eyed them suspiciously. Given I'd already discovered seasickness, I was pretty sure I'd find that the cars would make me sick too.</p><p>Vehicles weren't very common in the Land of Fire. You were much more likely to see horse drawn carts or carriages than cars. There were specialised work vehicles, like cranes - I remembered seeing one in the Land of Waves - but most common people never saw one and ninja weren't much more likely too. I guess they were a bit more necessary here, with the absolutely freezing temperatures.</p><p>I shivered. The ground was freezing, the air was freezing, even the <em> chakra</em> was freezing.</p><p>That was… interesting. I was used to Konoha, which had large amounts of free floating chakra in the air, simply because it had a lot of people <em> using</em> chakra. Land of Snow also had a lot of chakra in the air, but without that simple explanation.</p><p>"It's good to be home," Sandayuu said, quietly, looking out over the frozen white with a nostalgic expression.</p><p>"It's beautiful," I offered. It was in a way, clean and crisp, but very, very cold. A kind of beautiful I would appreciate much more in a photograph than up close and personal.</p><p>"It is." He smiled. "Come with me. We have one of the vans reserved for you. I'll show you where it is and show you the route we're going to follow."</p><p>The van he took us to was surprisingly spacious inside, done up like a small booth instead of the classic front seat- back seat set up.</p><p>"This is the path we will be taking," Sandayuu said, placing an inked map down on the table. "It follows the old railroad tracks, though they don't get used anymore, unfortunately. The first town where we will be stopping is here. Several of my old comrades will be meeting us. There is a tunnel through the mountains not far from it where we will be stopping to do some filming." He tapped the map. "We'll probably get there just after lunch time, though filming will probably take most of the afternoon."</p><p>Which meant we probably wouldn't get to the village until sundown. Lovely.</p><p>I studied the map. The distances weren't far, as the crow went - which sometimes was also the path the ninja went - but the terrain meant that the cars would have to follow a very winding path which dramatically increased the distance. Added to the slow speed of travelling on ice and we wouldn't be going very fast at all.</p><p>"The castle is… here?" I asked, motioning. Land of Snow wasn't very big. While it could take a ninja a week to get from one end of the Land of Fire to the other, here, I was pretty sure we could cross the entire country in a day, mountains included.</p><p>"Indeed," Sandayuu said.</p><p>"Should we patrol?" Sasuke asked, looking at Sensei. "The Snow ninja are going to come back."</p><p>"Most likely," Kakashi-sensei agreed.</p><p>"And the princess has already proven to be a flight risk," I said. "We really don't want to lose her again."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei blinked. "We'll be in the mountains of Snow Country. Where would she <em> go?</em> " He asked, baffled.</p><p>"Running away isn't about <em> going somewhere</em> ," I said patiently. "It's about trying to get away from something."</p><p>Some things you couldn't run from. But that never stopped anyone from trying. And it certainly seemed to be the mindset that Yukie was in.</p><p>"There are a lot of places for ambushes," Sasuke noted, looking over the map. "Passes, tunnels, crossroads…"</p><p>We spent a bit of time sorting out where the most likely spots for ambush were and how we were going to patrol. I quickly volunteered, because after the ship I didn't really want to try the cars. Sure, outside might be freezing, but it didn't make me sick.</p><p>As expected, the convey didn't move very fast, and it was after one before we came up to the tunnel through the mountains. The cars stopped briefly, apparently for a toilet break or for the drivers to discuss exactly where they were going to be filming. I caught a flash of pink out of the corner of my eye, and watched as Yukie slipped from her trailer into the snow.</p><p>"I'll talk to her," I said to Sasuke, jerking my chin in her direction and sighing.</p><p>It only took a few quick jumps to get a head of her. The side of the bank was sewn with thick, hardy trees and I almost felt at home.</p><p>"There's nothing out here," I said, sitting myself on one of the horizontal low hanging branches in her path.</p><p>She ground to a halt, staring at me in surprise.</p><p>"Cold, wet, miserable… you'd freeze within a day," I said, conversationally. "If you'd headed back down the road, you might have made it to the port we arrived at… If you'd gone forward you might have made it too the village… but in this direction there's nothing. Just pure, bleak, winter."</p><p>"Why are you doing this?" she asked, frustrated. "Why won't you just leave me alone?"</p><p>I sighed. "It's our mission. As ninja, we don't give up on missions. We don't quit. There are dozens of ninja rules covering that idea alone. But more than that…" I looked down at her. "I'm a human being. If people are hurt or in trouble or oppressed, and there's something I can do… shouldn't I do it? Shouldn't I <em> help?</em> "</p><p>"You can't save the whole world," she scoffed. "You can't save anybody."</p><p>"You never know until you try," I said, shrugging. "But… This isn't the first time we've done this."</p><p>"Done what?" she asked, confused at the sudden change of subject. "Chased someone down?"</p><p>"That too," I agreed. "But what I'm talking about… is more than that. Our first big mission… was to a place called the Land of Waves. Tiny place. It's a series of islands, not really big enough to call a country, but they do it anyway. They don't really have a proper feudal lord, or anything, but because it's an island community, they're pretty heavily dependant on shipping to bring them goods and food."</p><p>"I don't really care," she said.</p><p>I continued as if I hadn't heard, swinging my legs a little. "Then this guy comes along. Gatou. Some big shot head of a shipping company. Started squeezing them for money, blocking trade, all kinds of nasty stuff. Things were getting pretty bad there."</p><p>She looked interested despite herself. "So they what, hired you to kill him?"</p><p>"Nah," I said. "They started building a bridge."</p><p>I smirked at her shocked look.</p><p>"They figured, if Gatou controlled the waters… then they just had to find another way. It might possibly be the longest bridge in the Elemental Nations, but they built it."</p><p>"They wouldn't have got away with it," she said sullenly.</p><p>"Yeah. They nearly didn't," I agreed. "Gatou hired some ninja to take the bridge builder out. In return, they hired us to protect him. Eventually, things came to a head, Gatou died, the bridge was built and Wave Country started to rebuild. How's that for a happy ending?" I tilted my head. "Well, for us it was a happy ending to a mission. I guess for them it was a happy beginning."</p><p>"There's no bridge here," she said.</p><p>I studied her. "It wasn't about the bridge itself. It was about the people coming together to fight back, not just sitting around waiting for the end to come. If you think about it like that… in Snow Country, that bridge is you."</p><p>She didn't respond. I shrugged and hopped down off the tree. "If you're ever in Wave Country, look up the name of the bridge. It might clear up some things."</p><p>"The name of the bridge?" She muttered, bemused. I'd probably confused her more than persuaded her, but well, whatever worked I guess.</p><p>I straightened my cloak and ushered her around. "Come on. Let's go back to the vehicles. It's warmer inside."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Yes, that is Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On'. What other songs do you think of when you think Titanic? XD</p><p>This chapter would have probably been out two days ago if I hadn't got lost on Tvtropes. I was looking for other stories with the necklace-locket-key-plot token thing and couldn't think of any off the top of my head. I <em> know</em> it's common…</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Snow Arc: Chapter 50</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi starring as Horatio Caine. You make me giggle so much. XD</p><p>So I had a job interview. Failed to get job. Lots of time to write fic, still.</p><p>Sidestories has Naruto's POV of this chapter, if anyone is interested.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 50</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> In the midst of winter, I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer. - Albert Camus</em></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The path widened a bit after we exited the tunnel, and all the vehicles pulled to the side by the sheer drop away cliff. The other side was a much more gentle rising slope covered in puffy white snow.</p><p>I kept half an eye on Yukie, where she was sullenly having her stage make up applied, and the rest of my attention focused outwards. Stationary targets were easy targets.</p><p>The surroundings were quiet. There wasn't any body but us for as far as I could sense. Granted, my range wasn't huge, but it would give a fair warning for a sneak attack.</p><p>Then chakra surged through the ground and I sprang out of the way like a startled cat.</p><p>I was prepared for an attack, because that was usually what a chakra surge <em> meant</em> , and my team reacted to my reaction.</p><p>The chakra didn't change, didn't morph into a jutsu, but the snow hissed and melted away to reveal four parallel iron rails.</p><p>"The railroad!" Sandayuu exclaimed, bending down to examine it. "There's chakra running through the rails and it's melting the ice." He looked grim. "They're coming. We'll be in trouble if we get caught here. We need to run."</p><p>Using the rails themselves to melt the ice was a clever solution to what had probably been the foremost danger to the trains, but it meant nothing good.</p><p>"No one clears the tracks unless they're going to travel them," I said.</p><p>Sandayuu started jogging up the snow bank, sinking heavily into the uncompacted snow. The rest hesitated, and waffled, but followed him. I noticed the camera man took his camera with him.</p><p>I ran up the snow after them, using chakra to stay on top of it. But… even with the people gone, it was sort of obvious that we were there. The cars were still parked there, the snow was disturbed… it wasn't exactly a pristine location.</p><p>I hesitated, then ran through the hand seals for the False Surroundings genjutsu, wiping the signs of our presence away.</p><p>Sasuke gave an approving nod, and we darted over the top of the hill, ducking low and finding places where we could still see.</p><p>Seconds later we heard the train, a deep growl that I hadn't heard in years yet was still so instantly recognisable, and then the ground started rumbling and shaking, vibrating all the way to my bones. The train <em> roared</em> out of the tunnel, heavy monstrous steel spread across two tracks with a huge, evil looking snowplough on the front.</p><p>The genjutsu covering the snow shattered and broke.</p><p>"Ninja on board," Sasuke said.</p><p>"I count maybe twelve ninja. Maybe more," I said, unable to keep a hint of worry out of my voice. That… wasn't good. Not good at all.</p><p>The train ground to a halt with remarkable efficiency. I did recall, vaguely, that trains didn't - couldn't - stop quickly because of momentum and inertia, but it seemed that either they'd known we were here already, or they had some way over overcoming that. Either was likely, really, considering that we already knew the rails were chakra conductive and chakra could seemingly break all laws of physics.</p><p>I cast an apprehensive look at Sensei. With so many civilians we couldn't run. Hiding had obviously failed. But we looked to be seriously out numbered here. We'd had enough trouble fighting <em> three</em> of them.</p><p>Grudgingly, I admitted that getting reinforcements was a good idea on their part. We'd already shown we could deal with three, so, coming back as is would have been silly. And they could get reinforcements a hell of a lot easier than we could.</p><p>"Koyuki Kazahana," a male voice said, with that peculiar mechanical echo that said it was being amplified through a speaker system. "I know that you are here."</p><p>Yukie went about three shades whiter. "Dotou."</p><p><em> Oh, dear.</em></p><p>There was a long pause, as they waited for a response. Then, Dotou spoke again. "Fetch her."</p><p>Chakra surged as they body flickered out of the train. Eleven of them, all wearing pale blue chakra armour, aligned in front of the train. Including the three we'd already met.</p><p>"Show them how hopeless resistance is," Dotou said.</p><p>I half considered starting an avalanche to try and thin their numbers, but there wasn't much snow in front of us, and any other location would increase the danger of friendly fire while still being less effective. Not really a good idea.</p><p>But by that same token, I'd probably have to be careful about how I used my explosive tags.</p><p>"Stick together," Kakashi-sensei murmured, even as he slid his headband up. "Watch each others backs."</p><p>A single kunai went winging overhead, bearing down on the Snow ninja. It had come from Naruto's direction, so I knew what was coming even before it suddenly multiplied. I added a few of my own to the mix, tags fluttering out behind them.</p><p>The sudden duplication caught them off guard, as it was designed to do. Some were deflected, some skittered off of metal, some sunk into flesh, and some were lodged in the chakra armour and exploded in little poofs of smoke as they were drained of chakra. It hadn't taken anyone out, but a few people had what looked to be movement restricting injuries and that was without the <em> other</em> trick the kunai had.</p><p>Given the utter number advantage they had, the fight should have been over <em> really</em> quickly. That it wasn't was down to three things.</p><p>One, Naruto was spamming clones to even the odds. Because they were contained chakra, and not in constant contact with the armour, they weren't getting drained as fast as other jutsu would, meaning they could get a few good solid hits in.</p><p>Two, we had fantastic team work. We were watching each others backs, covering openings, negating as much of their numerical advantage as we could.</p><p>Three, not only did they lack teamwork, they seemed to actively avoid getting close to each other. Oh, they matched up ranged and close quarters fighters, but there wasn't enough space here for ranged fighting and we were effectively blocking their path to Yukie.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes thoughtfully, in between putting an arm lock on someone and swinging him around to block an ice spear jutsu that tried to attack Sasuke from the back. The armour flared and absorbed it, but the force field that materialised pushed me away. I danced under a clumsy attack, keeping him occupied as a Naruto - possibly thrown by another fighter - blindsided him with a flying kick and knocked him cold.</p><p><em> Bad pun.</em></p><p>"What happens," I said, panting. "When something that drains chakra comes into contact with something that drains chakra?"</p><p>The armour <em> ran</em> on chakra, that much was obvious. The circular shoulder and chest mounts with the yin-yang symbol - the taijitu - on it were probably the batteries or chakra sinks. Given the way they avoided each other, it was possible…</p><p>We weren't doing badly, but we also couldn't keep this up. Being unable to use jutsu was probably - ironically - extending the length of time we could fight, since we weren't burning chakra as quickly but that didn't mean we <em> weren't</em> burning it. I, for one, wasn't really used to extended taijutsu fights, anyway. Sooner or later I'd fumble, make a misjudgement, get too tired, too slow…</p><p>Something needed to change.</p><p>Something did change, but not necessarily in the way that I wanted.</p><p>"Yukie!" Naruto shouted. "What are you doing?"</p><p>My heart sunk with dread and I nearly found myself trapped in an ice prison for my split second of distraction. I twisted and flipped awkwardly, feet sliding over ice, bending myself around the spires that sprung out of the ground in a feat of agility, flexibility and acrobatics that would have impressed me if I'd had time to note it.</p><p>"If you keep fighting, you will die," Yukie said. I couldn't see her, but her voice carried surprisingly well over all the fighting, despite being so quiet. "Just go home."</p><p>"No," Naruto <em> snarled, </em> and orange flooded the area, several dozen more clones appearing out of thin air. They surged forward.</p><p>I took the moment of being screened by the extra bodies and get some height so I could see what was going on. Sensei was there, fighting Nadare and two others, and there were the actors and, oh, there were the film crew - <em> filming. </em> Priorities! - and, shit, there was Yukie.</p><p>I saw as Fubuki broke away from the rest of the Snow ninja, pink hair visible against the snow, and scooped her up to carry her back to the train.</p><p>The tide of the battle had turned. Instead of them trying to get past us, it was now <em> us</em> trying to get past <em> them.</em></p><p>Orange surged forward as Naruto rushed the train, but one of the Snow ninja pulled up a wall of slick, heavy ice, and they redoubled their assault to keep us busy and unable to move. Several of them slipped away, back to the train, but it wasn't <em> enough</em> and we were pushed to keep fighting and we just <em> weren't getting anywhere</em> .</p><p>Then a heavy chugging sound started to fill the air and I realised that the train was starting up, starting to move, and we were about to lose the princess - had lost the princess - and, even though it probably would have been possible to create an avalanche further down to block the rails, or at least take out the bridge, it was too far for a single kunai throw and then there were two Snow ninja on me and I couldn't get free -</p><p>Then they fell to the side, and I sucked in a breath of air so cold it burnt my lungs.</p><p>"Alright?" Kakashi-sensei asked, mismatched eyes staring down at me like he was trying to catalogue injuries.</p><p>"Yeah. Fine," I rasped, scrambling to my feet. There were only two Snow ninja still conscious and Sasuke was holding them off. Kakashi-sensei darted away to help him, and I scanned the battlefield before realising something.</p><p>"Where's Naruto?"</p><p>"On the train," Kakashi-sensei said grimly, dropping the last ninja with a swift knife hand strike to the neck. Once again, I admired how brutally efficient he could be, once he decided to.</p><p><em> Well, shit.</em> There was a downward turn to Sasuke's lips that said he wasn't any happier with that information than I was.</p><p>On the surface, it wasn't necessarily that bad. If Naruto was free it meant we still had someone covering Yukie.</p><p>But it meant Naruto was essentially alone deep in enemy territory and we couldn't count on him being free. I trusted Naruto, I did, but even he couldn't win all the time.</p><p>"What are we going to do?" I asked.</p><p>"Go after him," Sasuke said, with a look that flat out <em> dared</em> Kakashi-sensei to say otherwise.</p><p>"We need to find out where they're going," Kakashi-sensei said, scuffing a hand through his hair. He turned and headed towards where the Director and cameraman were lying underneath a large white sheet, apparently trying to blend in with the snow.</p><p>"What a fight!" The Director enthused, apparently lacking any concern for the danger they'd just been in. "Drama! Excitement! And now to rescue the princess. Yes, this is what a film is made of."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei sort of blinked at him, before seeming to come to the decision to just ignore it. "Right," he drawled. "Where's Sandayuu? I need to know where the railway goes."</p><p>Sandayuu came puffing up the snow, a set of what looked to be green samurai armour over his normal clothes. I blinked. There were other people behind him, some the stuntmen and film crew, but others that I'd never seen before. They had swords, but they looked like they might actually know what to do with them, instead of using them as props.</p><p>"The railway?" He muttered. "Well, it goes everywhere. To every major city and port. But it's almost guaranteed that Dotou will take her to the castle. It's his base of operations and everybody knows it."</p><p>"Kazahana castle?" Sasuke repeated.</p><p>"Yes," he confirmed. "Well, we expected to have more time, but we're all ready to attack. Word has been sent out to the others-"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei cut him off. "There's very little you can do against a force of ninja."</p><p>Sandayuu nodded solemnly. "Most of us are survivors of the coup itself. We know what we're about to face. But for the princess… for the hope that the future will be different… we are prepared to do this."</p><p>Sensei sighed. "We won't wait for you," he warned. "We don't have time to."</p><p>Sandayuu nodded, like that was to be expected. "Please, save the princess."</p><p>Sensei turned to us. "Get your bags."</p><p>We pulled our stuff out of the vans, strapped it on, and were off. It was good to get moving again. We didn't follow the road, instead setting a good pace across the peaks of ice. It wasn't as fast as we could go, and I chaffed a little, but intellectually I knew there was no point in rushing and arriving tired.</p><p>"Why didn't you stop them?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei's eye flicked over to him. "You can't stop people who are that determined," he said mildly. "I could have spent longer trying to persuade him, but it would have been wasted time." He set his eye back on the path. "It will take them time to get ready and organised, and to travel. Hopefully it will be over and done before they get there. If worst comes to… they might make a good distraction."</p><p>It was harsh, but they were <em> willingly</em> going ahead with it. They knew the likely outcome as well as we did. Depending on what kind of force we found at the castle…</p><p>We didn't have any other options. We had no where to get reinforcements, and we <em> couldn't </em> leave Naruto there. That was not an option.</p><p>I hoped he was alright.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The castle, when we found it, was an intimidating looking place, all dark metal perched atop steep slops with looming glaciers behind it. It was late evening, the sky growing dark and ominous, which only made it more menacing.</p><p>"Can we sneak in?" Sasuke asked, as we crouched in the trees observing it.</p><p>"They know we're coming," Kakashi-sensei said flatly, staring at it. "And frankly, neither of you have the stealth skills required."</p><p>Probably true, I acknowledged, but it was still harsh. To be fair Genin four months into their career generally weren't expected to have to storm enemy strongholds, but it wasn't like our team ever did <em> normal.</em></p><p>"Okay, so," I said, then faltered because I didn't know. Oh, sure, I knew the standard textbook tactics for this situation but even running them through my head sounded dumb. I didn't want to say them out loud.</p><p>"We'll blow the lower wall in two places. One for a distraction, one for an entrance," he said. "Get in, find Naruto and the princess, and get out." He pulled out two spheres about the size of a closed fist. High grade explosives. Explosive tags - even my adjustable ones - had an upper limit on the amount of chakra they could convert to explosive force, so when trying to take out serious defensive structures you sometimes needed more serious firepower.</p><p>"The diversionary explosive will be set along the left wall, while we'll enter through the front right," Kakashi-sensei continued. "That means someone will have to circle around the outer walls to set the charge, then make their way back. I'll enter first and take out any opposition. You two follow and hold the area while we find Naruto."</p><p>He held one of the spheres out to me. "You know how to set them?"</p><p>I nodded. "Theoretically, anyway." Privately, I was amused, because, <em> really,</em> people said I had a reputation for blowing things up and how did they expect that to change if this was the kind of positive reinforcement I got?</p><p>"Don't worry if you have to throw it. Just make sure you prime it with a countdown long enough to get away."</p><p>I nodded. Carrying explosives would be pretty silly unless they were stable enough not to go off at every bump and jostle.</p><p>"Alright. Go. Set it off when you're ready. We'll take the explosion as the mark, and Sasuke will wait for you to return." He cast a look at Sasuke who nodded shortly. If they responded faster to the first explosion than expected, I might need Sasuke's help on the outside.</p><p>"Got it," I said easily. "Wait for the bang."</p><p>It was getting dark outside, and I was glad that the moon was close to full. The snow was starting to look eerie under the moonlight. I traversed the ground carefully, on the lookout for traps either natural or manmade. There didn't appear to be any patrols <em> outside</em> the castle, and I suspected that in Snow Country weather such a thing wouldn't really be practical. It was easy enough to stick to the steep cliffs and get within throwing distance of sleek, towering metal. I suspected that the entire thing was made out of chakra metal, and that trying to climb it would be a spectacularly bad idea. Usually, castles were a joke for ninja, but Snow Country just liked to be difficult.</p><p>"Here goes," I murmured, channelling chakra into the sphere <em> just so.</em> I felt the whirr and <em> change</em> and the almost hum it gave off as I armed it before drawing back and throwing to roll to a stop along the wall.</p><p>Then I booked it out of there.</p><p>I was around the corner and out of sight when the explosion went off, and half way to covering the distance to my team when the second one followed. There was nothing behind me, and I met up with Sasuke with a relieved nod before we charged through shattered metal with kunai in our hands.</p><p>The inside of the castle was all ledges and balconies in a three dimensional maze. It was easy to tell which way that Sensei had gone from the unconscious bodies on the floor.</p><p>"Come on," Sasuke said, leaping over the bodies and taking off down the hallway.</p><p>I followed, pausing at the corner to slap a seal on the wall that would bring the roof down, because it was one thing for them to know which way we'd gone and it was another to be able to follow us and our chances of getting out the same way we'd come in were pretty slim anyway.</p><p>"Goddamn," I panted after we'd strangled another corridor with judicious use of ninja wire, only to nearly slide into another squad of ninja that had descended from a balcony. "Is this Hidden Snow, or something?"</p><p>And hell, if these guys had had anywhere near the skills of the first three, or even the other eight that had attacked us this afternoon, we would have been screwed. Thankfully, being indoors stripped them of their ice jutsu, and the lack of space seemed to hamper them much more than it did us.</p><p>Then we came across Naruto fighting two ninja and didn't even pause to consider before throwing ourselves in the fight beside him.</p><p>"Clone!" he said. "Boss is downstairs with the princess!"</p><p>"How many of you are there?" I asked. At least we wouldn't be rescuing both Naruto and Yukie. In fact, it looked like Naruto was doing pretty good at the rescue thing on his own. The amount of confusion that dozens of Naruto's could provide was probably one of the reasons why we <em> hadn't</em> been swamped.</p><p>"Heaps," he replied with a foxy grin. "Soon as we saw you guys attacking we turned back to help out. Keep going straight ahead, there's a huge chasm thing with a long bridge and elevator cages." He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. "I'll hold 'em here."</p><p>I swallowed down the 'no, we won't leave you behind' because he was a clone, he said he was a clone even if he looked, sounded, <em> felt</em> real, it wasn't the same, and nodded. "See you soon."</p><p>Going down was <em> cold.</em> It was like the lower levels were <em> in</em> the rock-and-ice rather than isolated from them. Which was very poor planning for your luxury palace, let me tell you. But we darted through the corridors and ran into Kakashi-sensei and Naruto and Yukie, who had her necklace clutched in one hand and a kunai thick with Naruto's chakra in the other.</p><p><em> She still has that?</em> I wondered. It seemed strange that they hadn't taken it from her already.</p><p>"Let's go," Sensei said, and we took off again, pace slowed so that Yukie could keep up.</p><p>I paused to slap a seal down to collapse the bridge behind us, just in time to see the pale blue of the Snow ninja uniform at the other end.</p><p><em> Suckers.</em></p><p>Of course, it can't be that easy. It would <em> never</em> be that easy. Naruto and Sensei both seemed to have a fairly good idea of where we were going, and it made me wonder just how many clones Naruto had scattered around the castle scouting it out for him. But we still had to <em> cross</em> that distance, which brought it's own dangers.</p><p>We were half way across a large room that was maybe a foyer or atrium, half lit and eerie, when the lights flared bright and revealed Nadare's three and a man in courtly robes that had to be Dotou.</p><p>"Trying to escape, Koyuki?" he asked, voice deep and disapproving.</p><p>Her hands flexed, around the crystal and kunai both. "Dotou."</p><p>Then she stepped forward.</p><p><em> Oh, no.</em> I thought with dread, the world seeming to slow down. <em> Don't, Yukie, don't.</em></p><p>The Snow ninja blocked us, Yukie passing uncontested through their ranks. I didn't have to look to see Naruto's betrayed face.</p><p>"I am an actress," she said softly. "Always acting other people's scripts. Never my own."</p><p>"She had you fooled, didn't she?" Dotou said smugly. He reached out, a hand grabbing for the crystal without even seeming to pay any attention to Yukie herself.</p><p>Something, <em> something,</em> shifted in my vision, in my understanding of the situation, like looking at a optical illusion and suddenly <em> seeing</em> the hidden image. Yukie's hand twitched and horror dawned on me all over again.</p><p><em> Not us. She had </em> you<em> fooled.</em></p><p>The kunai, clenched in her left hand and forgotten, came up and <em> slammed</em> into his chest.</p><p>Dotou snarled, hand coming up to grab her throat. "Damn you!"</p><p>"Nee-chan!" Naruto shouted.</p><p>"I knew," she said, even as Dotou tried to choke her. "When I returned here, I would die. That's why, at least… It's all thanks to you, Naruto. Until the very end, I kept running away…"</p><p>"No!" He shouted. And the kunai that was lodged in Dotou's chest burst outward in a puff of chakra smoke, an orange clad form slamming into Yukie and pulling her away. The clone looked woozy and disorientated, falling to one knee above her.</p><p>"Chakra armour…" he wheezed.</p><p>"Yes," Dotou said, pulling apart his shredded kimono to reveal black metallic, overlapping plates covering his chest. "Your attack was futile, Koyuki. <em> Meaningless</em> . This is my advanced chakra armour. No puny knife can overcome this."</p><p>He stepped forward, towards her again.</p><p>"No!" Naruto shouted, fingers coming together in a cross seal.</p><p>And like that was the signal, we clashed.</p><p>It was a blur of confusion and fast paced, frenzied fighting but like the other ninja, being inside stripped them of their snow jutsu. There was no jutsu, no fancy tricks, just us and brutal taijutsu. The smell of smoke was thick in the air, and the roof was slowly collapsing, bits and pieces of stone and wood and steel falling all around us.</p><p>I slammed a thrusting kick into Fubuki's stomach, throwing her sliding back across the room. Her face had gone from smug arrogance to uncertainty to the very faintest hint of fear. We had retreated the first fight, and been overcome at the second and she had been over confident.</p><p>I felt the surge of ugly chakra, so unbearably hot in such a cold place that it stole the moisture from my throat - <em> Kyuubi, Kyuubi, Kyuubi</em> - as Naruto stood toe to toe, hand clenched in hand, with Mizore, holding him back with Bijuu enhanced strength. My body moved on automatic, dodging a piece of falling rebar, and I <em> couldn't </em> force myself closer, going instead after Fubuki.</p><p>Sasuke slid low, between the two of them, kicking upwards with a move copied from Lee and launching the much larger man into the air. The two of them followed him up, raining punishing blows down and I made a quick snap calculation of their trajectory.</p><p>Fubuki tried to blindside me, flickering to my left. I caught the punch across my forearm and would have winced at the impact if I hadn't been so hyped on adrenaline. Later, I'd feel that. Not so much right now.</p><p>I pulled in close instead of getting distance, knee slamming into her stomach and folding her over, foot barely touching back down before lifting again, an impossibly fast roundhouse kick snapping into her ribs. I twisted, torso angling to provide extra strength and counterbalance, and she tumbled backwards, slamming down into the ground.</p><p>I flipped out of the way, just as Sasuke shouted in exertion and slammed the last kick into Mizore, sending him crashing to the ground, exactly where she was lying.</p><p>I saw the widening of her eyes, before the two of them connected and their armour shorted out, the chakra sinks on their shoulders exploding.</p><p>"Hah," I panted, trying to breath. "So <em> that's</em> what happens…"</p><p>"You knew that would happen?" Naruto asked, and the Kyuubi chakra was gone and his eyes were perfectly blue but…</p><p>"Suspected?" I offered.</p><p>Sasuke shrugged. "That takes care of that," he said.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei touched down on the ground beside us, and I could see the crumpled form of Nadare on the ground behind him. Well, that was all the ninja taken care of.</p><p><em> Wait…</em></p><p>"Yukie!"</p><p><em> This mission is not going well.</em></p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Snow Arc: Chapter 51</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - Of <em> course</em> that's what Minato meant. Clearly this is the ultimate evolution of his technique. The only way that Naruto could top it would be with the Flying <em> Rainbow</em> God. XD Iwa will be <em> frozen in fear!</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 51</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> A single day is enough to make us a little larger or, another time, a little smaller. ~ Paul Klee</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"He went through the roof!" Naruto shouted, pointing upwards.</p><p>I squinted through the jagged hole torn in the ceiling. I couldn't see Dotou, but Yukie's pink coat was much easier to pick out against the dark night sky.</p><p>"He's flying?" I asked tentatively.</p><p>"Must have had wings," Sasuke said. "She did." He jerked his head at Fubuki, where she was lying on the ground.</p><p>"Do we know where they're going?" I asked. Because, well, chasing them was going to be damn difficult. There were no marks of passage, and who knew how fast or far they could travel. From here, we couldn't really even tell what <em> direction</em> they were going in.</p><p>Naruto bit his lip. "The Rainbow Glaciers," he said. "That's where they said the weapon was. I bet he's taking the key there."</p><p>"That's… worrying," Sasuke said grimly. I agreed silently. Their chakra armour was bad enough, I didn't want to have to fight whatever weapon they had.</p><p>"We need to go after them," Kakashi-sensei said. "Anyone injured?" He cast an assessing look over us.</p><p>I shook my head. Exhausted, yes, but not injured. We'd been fighting and running and fighting… and it looked like we were going to be doing a lot more running and fighting before this was done.</p><p>"Let's go, then," he said. "Once we get to the forest, you can eat as you run."</p><p>That was a good idea. Food was important in recovering chakra.</p><p>We abandoned the castle, and managed to get out without running into any other ninja. The fact that there was the sound of fighting and explosions going off in other parts of the building told me that either Naruto's clones were still at it, or we'd overestimated the amount of time that it would take for the ex-samurai to get here.</p><p>We hit the forest outside the castle and took a moment to orientate ourselves.</p><p>"Someone's already been this way," I said. It had taken a second to set in, because those weren't footprints, they were wheel tracks, but it still meant someone had passed this way.</p><p>"The Director," Kakashi-sensei said, without even looking to see what I'd seen. "You can still smell the smoke from his pipe."</p><p>Well, no. I couldn't. But Naruto nodded, like he could, and I just took their word for it instead of arguing.</p><p>The Rainbow Glaciers weren't <em> close</em> to the castle. It was a good three or four hour run before we even saw them in the distance. I felt <em> exhausted</em> . It had been at least fourteen hours since the fight by the train, and we'd been in constant motion since then. And we'd been patrolling all morning before that, even if nothing had happened.</p><p><em> Yay, ninja. More all-nighters than a university student with an assignment due…</em></p><p>Chakra made it easier, but we were starting to run low on that, too.</p><p>"I think they're already there," I said, swallowing heavily as a beam of light shot up into the air out of the centre of the Glaciers. Even from here, I could feel the huge surge in chakra. Not really a good sign.</p><p>"We need to hurry," Naruto said in agreement.</p><p>The Glaciers were, well, hard to describe. There was a flat basin of a shallow valley, with a tiny shrine in the middle ,and the edge of the basin dish was surrounded by six huge towering pillars that were wide in one direction and thin in the other so they almost looked like pieces of walls more than pillars. We were coming towards it from a steep, nearly sheer cliff face, which gave us a chance to analyse it, but not much cover once we started to move.</p><p>The ground underneath the shrine and pillars was so thick with chakra conducting metal that it made my teeth ache, and the air had so much chakra in it that I was surprised that it wasn't visible.</p><p>Dotou was standing next to the shrine, obviously having used the key to activate it. It was channelling chakra into the ground, into that abundance of metal, which was then getting carried outwards and away.</p><p>"Ley lines," I muttered. That was more of a spiritual concept, but it was close. Why it was happening was a question that I couldn't even begin to answer.</p><p>"Where is it?" Dotou muttered to himself, circling the small shrine. "Where is the treasure?"</p><p><em> Something</em> was obviously happening. The shrine was putting out chakra… or was it taking it in? The snow around it was steaming, and the pillars were beginning to melt, torrents of water sluicing down off their faces.</p><p>"Where <em> is it?</em> " He shouted, turning to Yukie where she sat huddled miserably to the side. She was on the other side of the clearing to us, and the open spaces meant that circling around unnoticed was going to be impossible.</p><p>We could wait, but every minute we lost was time that that thing was activated. Whatever it was, and whatever it did.</p><p>"Focus on keeping the princess out of danger," Kakashi-sensei said. "I'll take care of him. Everyone ready?"</p><p>We nodded.</p><p>"You better believe it," Naruto said fiercely.</p><p>We moved. Dotou was facing away, but either he sensed us, or something else gave us away, because he turned and saw us.</p><p>"Leaf ninja," he sneered. "Why must you <em> always </em> interfere?" His hands clumsily ran through seals. "Well, no more. It's over now. <em> Ice Release; Black Dragon Blizzard!</em> "</p><p>His black chakra armour crackled and surged with power, the chakra sink on his chest starting to glow, and then black lightning gathered in his hand. We twitched, ready to evade, to jump out of the way at a moments notice.</p><p>But he didn't aim for us.</p><p>It twisted and writhed, a black dragon with demonic red eyes, heading straight for Yukie.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei swore and <em> vanished,</em> becoming a blur of blue and green racing across the ice. At that distance, that speed, he was the only one of us with a hope of making it. I tucked my hands into my kunai pouch, pulling out fists full of kunai and explosive notes and hurled them unceremoniously at Dotou. Some clattered off his armour, the metal of the knives shattering, but that didn't stop the explosive notes.</p><p>The fireball <em> engulfed </em> him.</p><p>"Mass Shadow Clone Jutsu!" Naruto called, and suddenly there were many more of him darting across the ice. They hurled themselves at Dotou, some of them body slamming him and being thrown off, others getting hit and destroyed. But the moves were clumsy and it was clear that however much more powerful this set of chakra armour was, Dotou himself was not a ninja.</p><p>"Hold him still," Sasuke ordered, crouching and gripping his wrist. "Chidori!"</p><p>Lightning blossomed in his grip, chirping and shrieking. He burst forward, foot cracking the ice as he pushed off, winter cloak flaring out behind him. The Naruto clones cleared a path and he flew across the ice with Sharingan enhanced precision.</p><p>Light flared as the Chidori hit the armour, obscuring vision, and the Naruto clones tumbled away in puffs of smoke. Then Sasuke was thrown back with a cry, slamming into one of the tall pillars and cracking the ice surface. He wasn't moving, but his chakra was pulsing steadily. Knocked out then.</p><p><em> Ice surface?</em></p><p>For a moment, it was like time slowed down for me as everything clicked into place. Those weren't ice pillars, they were <em> mirrors.</em> Giant, twenty meter tall mirrors, reflecting back the chakra inside the valley, recirculating it, <em> heating it …</em></p><p>Then Naruto shouted "SASUKE!" and my attention jerked back to the fight. I threw another handful of kunai and explosives, more to buy time and as a distraction than because I thought they'd work. But there was a crack running through the chest of the armour; Sasuke's Chidori <em> had</em> done damage. Just not <em> enough.</em></p><p>"The circle!" I shouted, hoping Naruto understood. If he hit it again, it would probably break and short out like what had happened in the castle. And the very least, it would weaken the armour.</p><p>"I got it!" He shouted back, a clone standing behind him helping him form a Rasengan. I threw another handful of kunai and notes, the explosion knocking Dotou back a step and disrupting the jutsu he was trying to cast. A ninja would have dodged, and kept going, but he wasn't and he couldn't.</p><p><em> Good for us,</em> I thought.</p><p>I glanced back at Naruto to see how his progress was going and for a second I was blinded, as the first rays of the sunrise peaked over the horizon. They caught on the giant mirrors, reflected back again and again, brighter and brighter each time.</p><p>And. <em> Oh</em> .</p><p>The chakra in the air <em> was </em> visible, caught up in the spinning of Naruto's Rasengan, spiralling outwards and reflecting all the colours of the rainbow. It trailed behind him, transparent and translucent, like coloured smoke, as he ran across the melting snow.</p><p>And then he slammed it into Dotou's chest, right onto the broken chakra sink, and the focused dispersal of all that energy was so fast and violent that it made the very ground shake.</p><p>Dotou <em> flew </em> upwards, and uncontrolled ragdoll tumble before impacting heavily into the face of the mirror, shattering it behind him. I had no doubt that he was dead before he hit it, but it was unquestionable that he was by the time he fell and hit the ground.</p><p>"Nothing is over," Naruto panted. "Until you have a happy ending."</p><p>And all the chakra in the air was being sucked back down into the generator, down into the ground and flowing out through the veins of metal, through the<em> ley lines</em> , and the snow was melting… no, not just the snow, because there was <em> grass </em> there, underneath it, full grown and healthy like the middle of spring, not just bare and barren rock…</p><p>"If there is no spring," Yukie said, softly as Kakashi-sensei dropped down near us and set her on her feet. "Then you make it come." She laughed, softly, wondrously.</p><p>Behind them, some very familiar faces on a small rolling trailer came down the hill. It did look very much like they had been filming. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes.</p><p>Sasuke was awake, sitting awkwardly at the base of the mirror. Naruto had flopped down next to him, sprawled out on the grass.</p><p>"How…" Sandayuu said, looking about in amazement. He was still wearing his samurai armour, and it looked a little battered and dirty. "How did this happen?"</p><p>"It's a generator," I said, verbalising the things that I'd put together. "Not a weapon. The Land of Snow has a lot of chakra in the air, and the chakra conductive metal underground… it's probably what kept it in winter for so long… it kept trapping the cold, making it so the snow never melted…"</p><p>How clever. Using all the things that had kept the Land of Snow in perpetual winter for so long as <em> tools</em> to bring it into spring. Not fighting against them, but <em> using</em> them.</p><p>"But now, we will have spring," Yukie said.</p><p><em> Believe in the future</em> .</p><p>We turned to stare at the shrine, where the voice had come from. It was glowing, reflecting off the mirrors and producing an image… a hologram. It was clear and bright and I marvelled at the technology that would be necessary for it.</p><p><em> If you do, spring will come. Koyuki, what would you like to do then?</em></p><p><em> I'll become a princess,</em> a young, vibrantly dressed Yukie said, standing easily on the platform. She looked so innocent and happy. She was… maybe four or five. Maybe a little older, I wasn't sure.</p><p><em> Hmm? What kind of princess?</em></p><p><em> A strong one,</em> she replied, swinging her hands in a little girl dance. <em> A kind one. A princess who believes in justice!</em></p><p>Strong, rich male laughter echoed throughout the valley. <em> That's going to be very hard work.</em></p><p>"I did say that, before…" Yukie whispered, staring at it.</p><p><em> But if you don't give up, and keep believing in your dreams, one day you'll be one for sure. </em> The hologram shifted, a male form coming into view. Sousetsu Kazahana. Gently, he clasped the hexagonal crystal around the neck of the small princess. <em> Can you see that a very beautiful princess is standing here?</em></p><p><em> But I'm not quite decided yet,</em> Yukie said, twisting to look up at him. <em> There's one more thing that I want to become!</em></p><p><em> What's that?</em></p><p><em> An actress! </em> The small princess exclaimed.</p><p>The memory of Sousetsu laughed, and so did the woman standing beside me, tears dripping down her face.</p><p>"Ah, father," Koyuki said. "I became an actress. Now, it's time for me to be a princess, isn't it?"</p><p>I sighed, closing my eyes and turning up face up into the sunlight. The chakra in the air was warm and soothing and I hadn't realised how <em> cold</em> I had felt up until this moment.</p><p>Or how tired.</p><p><em> What a crazy day</em> , I thought.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Eventually, we had to head back to the castle to inform everyone of the new change in leadership. Dotou's body got sealed up and brought with us for proof, but by the time we made it back, so many people were panicking about the change in weather that they were pretty much willing to listen to <em> anyone</em> who knew what was going on.</p><p>The Hidden Snow ninja listened to the news with grim faces and retreated. They were in a bad position; things could get very messy for a ninja village if the Daimyo didn't like you, and they'd just been trying to kill her. I wondered if their limited tactics had been a way of hedging their bets in regards to the outcome. As far as I could recall, the only people they had tried to hurt had been <em> us.</em></p><p>Them leaving let us fade into the background as the last of the threats vanished. With their employer dead, there wasn't much reason for them to attack, but you never knew. Sandayuu bustled around, managing to either locate the people in charge, or simply convince them <em> he </em> was and got all of the film crew, actors and us lodging in one of the undamaged wings of the palace.</p><p>I was so happy with the idea of sleep that I didn't really care how he'd managed it.</p><p>The next couple of days were mostly the same. We kept out of the way as the palace was restored - quite a bit of it had collapsed, funny that - and Koyuki was so busy taking up the reigns as Daimyo that we didn't really get to see her.</p><p>Her coronation was rapidly organised, but no less beautiful for it. People turned up by the trainload, and it seemed that every spare inch of space was crammed with people - all joyous about the sudden spring weather.</p><p>"The device was incomplete," Koyuki confided in us, when she had a free moment after the ceremony. "That's why father never used it. But we have people studying it now, and eventually we will be able to refine it." She smiled. "And then someday the Land of Snow will be called the Land of Spring."</p><p>"That's good, Nee-chan," Naruto said, tucking his hands behind his head, and grinning. "I bet you can make it happen."</p><p>"Yes," she said. "We won't give up." She ducked down quickly and pressed a kiss to his cheek. "Thank you."</p><p>Naruto went very red. I giggled, I couldn't help myself.</p><p>"All of you," Koyuki amended with a smile. "For everything you did…. I wouldn't be here without you."</p><p>The next day, Sandayuu approached us. He had gone from being Koyuki's manager to being her assistant, but he looked ecstatic with the change.</p><p>"Ah, there you are! Thank you. Thank you very much," he said bowing deeply at the waist.</p><p>"It was our mission," Kakashi-sensei said, scratching the back of his neck awkwardly.</p><p>"Yes, well," he said, shuffling the files that he was carrying. "The Director tells me that they've finished filming now and are going to be returning to the Land of Fire."</p><p>Considering that we had come on the same boat they had, we'd been expecting to return with them. And <em> that</em> would depend on…</p><p>"Obviously, you were hired to protect Koyuki during the filming process and that is now over, despite being a much shorter timeframe than anticipated. Although I wont be returning with you, the Director assures me that you'll be welcome on board the ship."</p><p>"Good to know," Kakashi-sensei said. "Although, it may be difficult to get you a refund so far away."</p><p>Sandayuu shook his head. "That's not necessary." He handed Kakashi-sensei a folder. "I feel that the service Konoha provided is equal to the amount paid, despite the shortened timeframe."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei flicked through the file, then tucked it inside his vest. It was probably a paperwork or a disclaimer to the same extent.</p><p>"Oh," he added. "Koyuki wanted me to give you all these. I know it isn't much, but please, hold us in your memories."</p><p>He handed each of us an envelope, bowed again, and left.</p><p>I opened it curiously.</p><p>"An autograph!" Naruto exclaimed. "She told me she never gave autographs!"</p><p>I smiled at the picture. It must have been a rush printing, because it was of the five of us at the coronation yesterday, Koyuki all done up in her Daimyo's robes, and the courtyard filled with banners behind us.</p><p><em> Shikako Nara, </em></p><p><em> Happiness without an ending. I hope you find yours. </em></p><p><em> ~Yukie Fujikaze</em></p><p><em> ~Koyuki Kazahana</em></p><p>Then I realised something.</p><p>"I'm going to have to go back on the boat, aren't I?"</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Snow Arc: Chapter 52</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Valerie - not to worry, I do have a plot point for that. It's… in progress. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 52</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> We improve ourselves by victories over ourselves. There must be contest, and we must win. ~ Edward Gibbon </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"You know," Tsunade drawled from behind the missions desk. "Generally when I give people two month long missions, it means I don't see them again <em> for two months.</em> "</p><p>Given that it had taken less than a week to sail there, we'd spent less than a week there and then sailed back, we were in at well under a month.</p><p>"Mah, mah," Kakashi-sensei waved his hand lackadaisically. "The mission was completed successfully. Just… interestingly." His eye curved up into an irritatingly happy smile.</p><p>"Interestingly," Tsunade repeated, sounding unimpressed.</p><p>We nodded. Naruto sheepishly scratched the back of his head.</p><p>The other ninja manning the assignments desk were staring at us like they <em> really</em> hoped that we were going to expand on 'interesting'. It was a little uncomfortable.</p><p>"Alright, briefing room!" Tsunade snapped. "This is going to end up on my desk <em> anyway</em> , I just know it."</p><p>We trooped out of the mission assignment room and ignored the surge of conversation that happened behind us.</p><p>"Okay," Tsunade said, leaning back in her chair and eyeing us seriously. "What happened?"</p><p>We gave her the run down of the mission.</p><p>She stared at us and very slowly lifted a hand to rub her temples. "It was a simple, straightforward mission," she groused. "And while I can't see anything that points to it being your <em> fault</em> …"</p><p>That wasn't entirely true. We probably should have kept a better grip on Koyuki and not let her get kidnapped <em> twice</em> , for instance, but there was nothing we could do about the basic premise of her being the princess.</p><p>"Kakashi, you're probably going to have to spend the next day or two in the Intelligence Division filling them in on this new chakra armour and generator and what have you," she said with a sigh.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei groaned, but nodded. Yeah, I could see how they'd want that information.</p><p>"And, hmm, I suppose your early return solves one problem anyway," she folded both hands under her chin. "There's been a mission specifically requesting Sasuke Uchiha."</p><p>Sensei sharpened to attention. Heck, so did I.</p><p>"Relax," she said. "It's been vetted. Thoroughly. You've got tomorrow off, but come to my office to pick it up the day after."</p><p>Not the mission desk, her office. She was keeping her hands tight around it so that even if it was legitimate, the wrong people didn't find out and screw it up anyway. I wondered just how much of a shakedown was going on through Konoha's systems. Tsunade didn't seem the type to be anything less than completely thorough when she set her mind to something.</p><p>The thing was, turning down missions looked bad for a Hidden Village. And she could hardly <em> stop</em> sending Sasuke out. Well, she could, theoretically, but that really wasn't a viable long term solution.</p><p>"Fill out your paperwork," she directed. "Go home. Try not to cause trouble."</p><p>Naruto's incredibly innocent face probably didn't help our case any.</p><p>"So," I said, as the door shut behind her. "Dinner at my place?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>It was a quiet day off for me; Team 8 and Team 10 were both out of the village on missions. It was a strange feeling, so far it had always been the other way around. And I'd been looking forward to making Ino flip by telling her just who we'd been guarding.</p><p>I wrote my mission report, switched out all my winter gear and restocked my pack. A days worth of downtime wasn't exactly a lot, especially coming off an A-rank, but we weren't injured and the last week had been spent travelling and recovering anyway.</p><p>"Team Seven. Come in, come in," Tsunade said, waving a distracted hand at us as we entered her office.</p><p>"This is a C-rank mission from the Neko-baa, the proprietor of an independent supply outpost in the abandoned city of Sora-ku." The way she said it, Neko-baa sounded more like a title than a name, which made sense since it roughly translated to Grandmother Cat.</p><p>Sasuke stiffened noticeably.</p><p>"They used to have very strong ties with the Uchiha clan," Tsunade acknowledged with a dip of her head. "And the request was made specifically for Sasuke to be the one to fill it." She paused a beat, as though waiting for protests, then continued smoothly. "Kakashi is still working with the Intelligence Division to update our information on the Land of Snow so he won't be going with you. It's only a C-rank, so two Genin and a Chunin should be an adequate team, even if you are rookies."</p><p>"Yes, Tsunade-sama," I said respectfully. Going without Kakashi-sensei added a nervous thrill to the mission, but as long as it <em> stayed</em> a C-rank, we should be fine.</p><p>She nodded. "The Neko-baa will be waiting at the outpost in Sora-ku with additional details for you. There are directions in the mission scroll, but I assume you know where it is?" The last bit was directed at Sasuke with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>He nodded. "I know where it is." He sounded a little stiff, and I glanced at him curiously out the corner of my eye. I'd ask, later.</p><p>"Off you go then," she said, dismissing us.</p><p>Sora-ku was just slightly less than a full days travel to the north-east, in the middle of a barren rocky stretch more similar to something you'd expect to find in the Land of Earth than the Land of Fire. The city itself was …<em> bigger</em> than I expected, tall square buildings that stood several stories high… blocks of nearly identical buildings tightly compressed into a small area.</p><p>"This place is creepy," Naruto said, staring around.</p><p>It was abandoned, and though there were signs of disrepair on the buildings, signs that it had been abandoned for a long while, there was no clear cut destruction or destabilisation that showed <em> why</em> it was abandoned.</p><p>Sasuke just grunted. "This way," he said.</p><p>"You've been here before, right Sasuke?" I asked, glancing at him. "You seemed to know what Tsunade was talking about." He still looked tense, even after travelling here. It could have been the general reminder of his clan, but…</p><p>"I… came here when I was younger," he said quietly. "With Itachi." His hands clenched tightly into fists.</p><p>"I see," I said, even though it didn't clear up everything. It was no wonder that he was tense, though.</p><p>Naruto had an uncharacteristically serious look on his face at the announcement. "So how much further to the old lady's place?" was all he asked.</p><p>Sasuke scoffed. "You're the one with the mission scroll; why don't you tell me?"</p><p>"You're the one that's been here before," Naruto shot back, a playful glint in his eyes.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at their bickering, but it was better than doom and gloom. And it was friendly teasing, neither of them serious enough to be actually annoyed.</p><p>"This is it," Sasuke said, stopping in front of a building that looked more cared for than the rest. He paused for a second, then breathed deeply and went inside.</p><p>Naruto and I followed. I was a little surprised that Naruto hadn't brought up the issue of who exactly was team leader here, but I guessed that either personal history outweighed rank in his mind or he hadn't started thinking of himself in the role of team leader. To be fair, all our team decisions and planning had always been based more on a general consensus than any one of us taking charge and Kakashi-sensei really only took over when things went to hell anyway.</p><p>"I'm glad you came, Sasuke-boy," an old woman said as we entered the room. The <em> shop</em> more like. The walls were covered in good quality weapons - kunai, shuriken, katana - and there were shelves of all kinds of bottles and jars. And there were cats. Everywhere. Not that that was a bad thing; I rather liked cats myself.</p><p>"It's been a long time Neko-baa," Sasuke said respectfully.</p><p>"My how you've grown," she said. "It has been a few years, hasn't it?"</p><p>He nodded shortly. "You hired us for a mission."</p><p>"Yes, yes. The young are so impatient," she sighed. "Tamaki! Bring me the Paw Encyclopaedia."</p><p>A young girl - well, youngish. She was probably about the same age we were - stepped out from the back room carrying a think, pink covered book.</p><p>"You turned that into a book?" Sasuke asked, surprised.</p><p>"Indeed, I did," she replied, looking pleased with herself. "But it isn't finished."</p><p>I looked curiously at the book, wondering just what it was. Neko-baa caught my gaze and chuckled.</p><p>"Sasuke collected all of these," she said opening it, and showing us what looked to be ink stamps of cats paws - not just housecats but lions and tigers… oh my. "When he came here with his brother." She shook her head. "But it isn't finished. There's still one more paw print that I need to get."</p><p>"One?" Sasuke repeated, faint surprise in his voice.</p><p>Neko-baa nodded, turning to a specific page. "I asked Yugito Nii of the Hidden Cloud and she kindly agreed."</p><p>I choked on a giggle, just a little bit, at the kind of insane balls that it would take to ask a Jinchuriki for a paw print. Crazy old lady. Then again, Naruto would find something like that hilarious if someone was making a fox book.</p><p>"Huh?" Naruto asked, not getting it.</p><p>"Yugito Nii," I said, breathlessly. "Is the Jinchuriki for the Two Tailed Cat." It wasn't exactly secret knowledge; Hidden Cloud <em> liked</em> making sure everyone knew they had two effective Jinchuriki.</p><p>"Nekomata is the only one that remains," she continued. "He's a big shot in the ninja cat underworld that never shows his face in public. He hides in an impregnable fortress. The number of ninja cats who guard Nekomata is unknown. Can you handle this?"</p><p>Sasuke nodded curtly.</p><p>"Just leave it to us!" Naruto said.</p><p>"Very well," she said gravely. "In order to infiltrate the fortress you will need these."</p><p>She whipped out … fuzzy, cat ear headbands?</p><p>"If you put these on, the cats will think you're one of them."</p><p>"And it'll let you understand cat talk!" One of the cats sitting beside her chirped. I tried not to flinch in surprise. It wasn't that I wasn't used to animals that could talk, I just hadn't expected it.</p><p>"Alright," I said doubtfully, but my distrust vanished the instant I actually touched them. They were imbued with chakra. Some kind of seal work or genjutsu? I shrugged, and slid them on.</p><p>Naruto had no problems wearing them either, but Sasuke gave them a distasteful look, before he put them on. Oh, they looked too cute.</p><p>"I wish I had a camera," I said quietly, so he didn't hear me.</p><p>The young girl, Tamaki, giggled and held her finger to her lips before slipping off to the back of the shop.</p><p>"Using the headbands, Hina and Denka will summon you to just outside the Cat Fortress," Neko-baa continued. "They won't be able to take you close, but they should be able to point you in the right direction."</p><p>"Okay!" Naruto cheered. "When do we leave?"</p><p>Neko-baa smiled. "As soon as you're ready."</p><p>"Then let's do this," Sasuke said firmly.</p><p>Two of the cats vanished in a puff of smoke, and then I felt a tugging sensation, not all that different from being the target of a replacement jutsu. White chakra smoke obscured my vision and when it cleared the scenery was different. We were outside, for one, and there were hills and trees and grass rather than the bare rock of the land around Sora-ku. The air and chakra were different too.</p><p>Well. We had been reverse summoned. It was to be expected.</p><p>"This way!" Hina said, running forward. We followed until we cleared the tops of one of the hills and saw a valley with a lake nestled in the centre. And built into the centre of that lake was the Cat Fortress.</p><p>Not just a fortress <em> belonging</em> to the cats… but a fortress built in the shape of a cat.</p><p>"Zero points for guessing where we're headed," I murmured.</p><p>"We're known in these parts," our guide said. "So we can't go any further."</p><p>"No ninja cat has ever seen Nekomata's face," Denka added. "Will you be able to find him?"</p><p>"Thanks to these, infiltrating will be quite easy," Sasuke said, gesturing at his cat ears. If Sakura and Ino could see him now… "If we can get in successfully, the rest will be easy."</p><p>"Wait! Hold it," Naruto cut in. "We're supposed to be able to talk to ninja cats with these things, right? Meaning there's no need to start a fight. Let's just talk it out with him. I'm sure he'd be willing to give us one or two paw prints."</p><p>"Impossible," Hina said.</p><p>"What? Why?" Naruto asked, bewildered.</p><p>"Having your paw print taken is extremely embarrassing for a cat," Denka said, as a matter of fact.</p><p>"For humans, it would be like being stripped naked and then photographed," Hina added, licking a paw.</p><p>Well, some people did it. I wondered if Yugito Ni knew… okay bad thoughts. Not going there. Actually, if the cats were intelligent enough to talk and reason, did this count as a violation of privacy? That was … suspect.</p><p>"I think talking will be useless," the old cat said.</p><p>I shrugged. "Trying diplomacy never hurts, even if you think it will be useless." Sometimes it was but that didn't mean you should stop trying. Besides, Naruto had been the one to suggest a less violent path, and I didn't want to dismiss that.</p><p>"Let's go," Sasuke said, breaking the argument. His gaze was fixed on the fortress.</p><p>We moved off, circling around to approach the single bridge that lead out across the water. The second we set foot on that, we'd be in hostile territory.</p><p><em> Here's hoping these headbands work</em> .</p><p>I wasn't <em> quite</em> sure how much of a threat to consider these ninja cats. Obviously, they were summons animals, and therefore worthy of respect, but that didn't mean they were all fighters, or even that they were powerful ones. Although, conversely, it didn't mean they <em> weren't </em> either.</p><p>We stepped onto the bridge.</p><p>No immediate alarms were raised. There were other cats coming and going, and none of them seemed to be giving us a second glance.</p><p>"I think we're good," I said, tentatively.</p><p>We walked forward, keeping a steady, even pace and joined the line of cats waiting to enter the fortress. There were two guards by the door, checking everyone who passed. That would be our first test.</p><p>"Next!" The guard cats wearing pseudo samurai armour called. We stepped forward. "I don't recognise you guys."</p><p>"We're newbie cats!" Naruto said cheerfully.</p><p>Sasuke went the smarter route and bribed them, with a small jar of catnip. "Here."</p><p>"For someone new, you're quick to catch on." The cats levelled their spears at us.</p><p>I froze, legs tensing, ready to dodge or fight at their next action.</p><p>"So here's a reward for you! New cats that get the idea are welcome!" They twisted the spears, one end coming away to reveal a fluffy cat toy that bobbed in the air in front of us.</p><p>I blinked at the mood whiplash. The toys bobbed. The guards looked on expectantly.</p><p>Gingerly, I reached out a hand and batted at it, as a cat would do. We were trying to sneak in, so acting so as they seemed to expect us to was important. After a seconds hesitation, the boys joined in. I giggled, just a little, at the <em> absurdity</em> of it.</p><p>"You like that?" The guard chortled. "Yes, yes. Welcome to Nekomata's Fortress. I hope to see you around."</p><p>They withdrew their toys, returning the sheath that made it into a spear and let us pass.</p><p>"Close one," Naruto said as we entered what looked like the main courtyard. "I thought they had us there."</p><p>"So did I," Sasuke admitted, looking around. The place was fairly well lit, which was good because it was getting dark. "Now we need to find Nekomata."</p><p>"We could search," I murmured, before nodding at the main, cat shaped tower. "But I think the main tower is our best bet. It's the most logical choice and it's where the strongest chakra signal is coming from."</p><p>"As good a place to start as any," Naruto said with a shrug, starting off in that direction.</p><p>Sasuke didn't move.</p><p>"Sasuke?" I asked, carefully.</p><p>He looked at us both. "I need to be the one to fight Nekomata," he said.</p><p>I exchanged a worried look with Naruto. "Why would you say that?"</p><p>"It was… it was a target Itachi set me, but one he always said I wasn't ready for," he said. "I need… to prove that I can. To overcome it."</p><p>For someone he wanted to kill, Sasuke cared an awful lot about measuring up to Itachi's standards. It made sense in a way - just because someone you loved did something horrible, didn't mean you stopped loving them; you just started hating them as well, and that wasn't the same thing at all - but it was heart achingly sad.</p><p>"You don't have to do this alone, you know," I said gently. "We're with you."</p><p>"I know," he said. "But this is <em> important </em> and it wouldn't be the same…"</p><p>I thought I could see the reasons Sasuke was trying to articulate, even if I couldn't really understand them.</p><p>"Fine," Naruto said abruptly. "But don't think we wont jump in if you're losing. Because we will."</p><p>Sasuke snorted. "I won't lose."</p><p>"And don't think that that line of reasoning is going to work too often," I added wryly. "Because there's only so much I'm willing to let you get away with."</p><p>He smirked. "I wouldn't expect anything less," he assured me.</p><p>We headed to the main building, finding the stairs and going upwards. No one tried to stop us, but it was a little nerve wracking all the same. We were at the level below Nekomata when we ran into trouble. The stairwell opened into what looked to be a well staffed guard room, with half a dozen cats in samurai style armour.</p><p>The doorway to the next stairwell was straight across the room, and after a seconds hesitation, we strode for it confidently, hoping we could bluff our way through this. Sometimes, acting like you were allowed to be there was all it took.</p><p>"H-hey!" One of the cats squawked as we neared the doorway. "What do you think you're doing? No one's allowed to see the boss!"</p><p>"It's really important that we see him!" Naruto said earnestly. "He really needs to hear what we have to say!"</p><p>The cat looked doubtful. "You can just tell it to his attendant," he offered. "That's what everyone does." He frowned, and peered at us. "You know, I haven't seen you guys around before…"</p><p>"We're new," Sasuke said, offering the same excuse we'd used at the gate. I could see that it wasn't going to work though, or at least not how we needed it to. Unobtrusively, I turned sideways, sliding behind Sasuke and blocking my hands from view. Gently, very gently - made more difficult because I didn't actually know what we looked like to them - I settled a False Surroundings genjutsu over the group, duplicating the room exactly to give the impression that we were moving away from the door.</p><p>"Well, I'll forgive you for not knowing how things are done then," the cat said. "But Nekomata-sama doesn't need to be bothered with petty details. That's why we have people to report to, you know."</p><p>I grabbed Sasuke and Naruto by the arms, tugging them backwards, even as the cat followed open air like we were moving. I didn't expect it to hold for long because they were <em> cats</em> and their sensory priorities were different to ours. Still, they weren't expecting it, and I was being as subtle as I could with it.</p><p>We slid up the stairs silently, appearing at a large, stone room with low lighting. One end had a raised pavilion with bamboo blinds blocking our view.</p><p>We traded glances.</p><p>"Nekomata?" Naruto called, voice echoing loudly. "Eh, Nekomata? We're ninja on a mission for Neko-baa-chan, to get a paw print from you. Whaddaya say?"</p><p>There was a shifting, rustling sound, and behind the bamboo screen, a huge shadow loomed. "Such <em> insolence</em> ," he growled.</p><p>"It'll be easier if you willingly offer your paw," Sasuke stated. "If not, this will be quite painful for you."</p><p>I was tempted to roll my eyes, just a little.</p><p>The cat laughed. "You have guts to stand before me and make such threats."</p><p>That hall <em> changed</em> .</p><p><em> Genjutsu</em> . I shook it off, snapping out of the illusion and grabbing Naruto's arm to disperse it for him. Sasuke's eyes were already spinning Sharingan red.</p><p>Below us, I heard the wail of a siren starting up.</p><p>"Looks like they discovered our trick," I said. Meaning, there would probably be a whole lot of guards pouring into the room very soon. "Naruto and I will guard the stairway." With that as a choke point, we'd be able to restrict the number of enemies we had to fight at any one time.</p><p>Sasuke nodded, satisfied. "Good." He leapt forward, putting a decent amount of space between us. "The Sharingan can see through genjutsu," he informed Nekomata coldly. "That won't work on me."</p><p>A huge form moved off the pavilion, white and blue stripes. Nekomata was <em> big,</em> but not in league with Gamabunta or Shukaku.</p><p>"Then I'll go with brute strength!" He lashed out, claws arched and his paw slammed into the ground, sending chips of stone flying. Sasuke dodged agilely, evading the angry swipes.</p><p>"Here they come," I said, turning back to the descending stairwell and away from Sasuke's fight. "Get ready, Naruto."</p><p>The first cat charging up the stairwell had his spear already out and ready. It was easy enough to catch him in my shadow possession jutsu and then spin it like a staff to knock out those around him. There was strange resistance on the jutsu, and the different joints made the moves translate awkwardly, but it worked well enough.</p><p>Some of the cats had very flexible taijutsu styles, able to bend around our attacks, or to change direction on a whim, but the small space of the stairwell limited them and with two of us defending the top, it was a painless fight.</p><p>"How long do you think Sasuke is going to take?" Naruto grumbled, blocking claw swipe with his kunai.</p><p>"Probably not much longer," I said, listening to the ground shaking <em> thump</em> of something very large hitting the floor hard.</p><p>Naruto snorted. "Nice timing."</p><p>"Proper timing is an essential component of ninja battles," I said faux-haughtily. "And witty quips."</p><p>He laughed. "Sure. But… important question here; how are we going to get out? Because I'm pretty sure we won't be able to sneak out." He threw another attacker back down the stairs, bowling over two others that weren't quick enough to get out of the way.</p><p>And they were probably going to be guarding the bridge something fierce. "Through the window," I suggested. "Just slide down the wall and go across the water?"</p><p>"Mission accomplished," Sasuke said behind us, a folded up piece of canvas in his hands. "Let's go."</p><p>He looked pleased with himself, lighter somehow, like overcoming this challenge had been important. Maybe it wasn't something that had weighed on his mind until it had been brought up again, but having it over with <em> meant</em> something to him.</p><p>"Awesome," Naruto cheered. "Let's get back to Neko-baa-chan."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hidden Waterfall Arc: Chapter 53</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: For all of you that asked; yes, that was a real episode. Shippuden 189, Paw Encyclopaedia. This chapter is the OVA Protect the Hidden Waterfall Village.</p><p>So I know Kakashi's message is probably just a plot device to get him out of the way and let the kids do the fighting, but my brain likes picking on things like that and making them into <em> something.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 53</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> A hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with his freedom. ~ Bob Dylan</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Three days later saw the full Team Seven assembled and escorting Shibuki back to Hidden Waterfall. He was a ninja himself - newly instated leader of the village, though I think the post was more administrative in requirement than that of a Kage - so 'escorting' in this mission meant less 'protect' and more 'keep him from poking his nose in places that we don't want it'.</p><p>Because he was from an allied - and trusted, which wasn't always the same thing - village, it was only a C-rank. If he'd been from a village that we had strained relations with, or one of the big five at all, it would have been a B or A and wouldn't have come anywhere near us.</p><p>Shibuki himself was… twitchy.</p><p>It got old, pretty fast. Every time he jumped at wildlife or 'heard something' I reacted to his reaction. We'd been wired tightly <em> because</em> our previous missions had had a tendency to go badly and quick reaction times had been our saving grace. Here… it was exhausting.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei appeared not to notice at all, and gave off the impression that he found our repeated startling highly amusing. Since I knew he was twice as aware of any threats as we were, his ability to filter out non-threatening stimuli was pretty amazing.</p><p>So we were pretty relieved when we finally got to our destination, a large lake fed by a huge waterfall at one end. Presumably Hidden Waterfall was nearby, since there were two kids wandering about who greeted Shibuki enthusiastically.</p><p>Hidden Waterfall, as a ninja village, was fairly unique. For one, it was actually <em> hidden</em> and only the residents knew how to find it. For another, Land of Waterfalls claimed to have never been invaded, which was a pretty strong comment considering the nearby Land of Rain had been repeatedly devastated by it's stronger neighbours. Part of that could be attributed to the third interesting point; it was the only minor village to house a Jinchuriki.</p><p>The exact identity of the current Jinchuriki wasn't known, but there were a couple of suspects among the upper tier of the village. For a small place with only a few dozen ninja, it had a consistently high level of shinobi. Either they had an <em> excellent</em> training program or… well. Or something.</p><p>"Could you help us, please?" The young girl asked, after they'd finished greeting Shibuki. "We have to clean up the litter in the water, but the current is strong and it can be pretty scary."</p><p>Naruto groaned.</p><p>"Consider it part of your mission," Shibuki said with a laugh.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei said nothing against it, apart from a mild reminder that it would be considered an extra mission, before taking a seat in the shade and leaving us to it.</p><p>"This sucks," Naruto said with a sigh.</p><p>"Cheer up," I said. "It's not like it's anything we haven't done before."</p><p>So picking up rubbish was hardly the greatest of missions but it would be over fairly quickly. The sun was shining and the water was cool and clear, so it wasn't as bad as it could have been.</p><p>We were jerked to attention by Shibuki's startled cry, a sound which had become familiar to us on the journey.</p><p>"Not to worry," Kakashi-sensei said, as a bird swooped down to perch on his arm. "It's just a messenger bird from Konoha." He easily unravelled the message tied to it's leg.</p><p>"Sensei?" I asked tentatively, because it <em> really</em> wasn't common to contact ninja that were out on missions. And when something unusual happened, it generally didn't mean anything good.</p><p>"I hate to miss out on the fun," Kakashi-sensei said laconically. "But it looks like you three will have to finish up here on your own. Complete the clean up and head straight back to Konoha, okay?"</p><p>"Wait, wait!" Naruto protested. "Where are you going?"</p><p>"There's been an emergency meeting called," Kakashi-sensei said. "I wouldn't worry about it, if I were you." He gave us a reassuring smile.</p><p><em> Emergency meeting?</em> My questions died in my throat. With Shibuki here - a foreign ninja - Kakashi-sensei wouldn't say any more than that. Even his leaving was highly suspicious.</p><p>Because you <em> didn't</em> call a ninja back from a mission for a <em> meeting</em> and if the emergency was anything less than dire, he would have waited for us to finish up to save face. Heck, suggesting that Naruto use Shadow Clones would have had the whole thing done in minutes.</p><p><em> Unless he wasn't supposed to take you…</em></p><p>But even then it would have been easy enough to send us on our way alone, since he could move faster without us. Which meant that it was an every-second-counts, Jounin response only emergency…</p><p><em> Which is what?</em></p><p>I tried not to think about it too hard. Without any information, every situation my brain created would be as false as it was worrying.</p><p>I glanced at my team mates as Kakashi-sensei took off, leaping straight into the tree tops. Naruto looked mostly annoyed, and truthfully, I hadn't really expected him to pick up on the subtext, but either Sasuke hadn't picked up on it either, or he was better at hiding his thoughts than I was.</p><p>Numbly, I went back to picking up litter.</p><p>We were pretty much finished when the mother of the two children came out of the trees to get them. At first I didn't pay her much attention, really, but Naruto lifted his head, nose twitching and face set in a peculiar expression.</p><p>"I smell blood," he said.</p><p>We waded out of the water, dumping the sacks of rubbish on the ground.</p><p>"Shibuki-sama," she was saying, voice trembling. "It was terrible… they attacked without warning…"</p><p>I saw the way her facial muscles went slack a split second before her legs gave out and lunged forward to catch her weight before she sprawled out on the ground. Grunting, I lowered her down gently to reveal what we hadn't seen before - the kunai stuck into her back.</p><p>"<em> Mother!</em> " the kids shouted.</p><p>"It's okay," I reassured them. "It's not as bad as it looks." It couldn't be. She was walking, so obviously it hadn't severed her spine, and it wasn't gushing blood, so it hadn't hit any major arteries or veins. It had probably just been the shock and pain that had got to her.</p><p>"We've got to get to the village right away!" The boy said.</p><p>"That wouldn't be a good idea," Sasuke refuted calmly.</p><p>"She said they attacked without warning," Naruto added.</p><p>"That's impossible," Shibuki protested weakly. "How could anyone find this place?"</p><p>No one answered him.</p><p>"Shikako," Naruto said. "Can you…" he made a weak gesture towards the woman and kids.</p><p>I understood. "I'll take them into the forest. We'll find somewhere to hole up while you guys check out the village. Stay safe," I added.</p><p>It wasn't that I was precisely <em> thrilled</em> about being the one left behind, but in this case it made sense. <em> Someone</em> needed to look after the kids, the mother was injured and I knew healing jutsu.</p><p>"Four incoming," I murmured in a low tone. "Behind the waterfall."</p><p>Shibuki's mouth thinned at the information.</p><p>"Go," Sasuke said, pulling his foldable fuuma shuriken out of his pouch. "I've got this."</p><p>I ducked, heaving the woman over my shoulder and beckoned the kids. "Come on. Lets get out of here and take care of your mum, okay?"</p><p>For kids under pressure, they were doing really well.</p><p>"Are you two at the Academy?" I asked, hustling them away while at the same time trying to keep an eye on the fight behind us. There was the sharp clanging of metal on metal as incoming kunai were deflected, but it was hard to really hear over the roaring of the waterfall. It had become background noise over the last hour or so, but it still muffled other sounds.</p><p>"Uh, huh," the boy said. I really had to find out their names. "We just started this year."</p><p>"You're doing very well," I said. "Keeping calm is important."</p><p>Unseen to them, I grimaced. We couldn't go too far away, it would simply take too long with having to carry the woman and at the pace the kids were travelling. The surroundings weren't exactly good for cover either, with a sheer cliff going up and the land below pancake flat. It was forested, of course, and with a team of ninja or by myself it would have been fine, but hiding civilians in a forest is tricky.</p><p>There was a small curve in the cliff, not enough to be called a cave, but it would probably give <em> some</em> protection. Hopefully.</p><p>"Okay," I said, carefully setting the woman down and then rolling my shoulder. She wasn't exactly light and if I hadn't been a ninja, I wouldn't have been able to carry her, let alone so easily. "Let's see what we can do about this."</p><p>I dropped a False Surrounding genjutsu over us, hoping it would buy us time while I dealt with this injury. There was no reason to suspect that they were looking for us, of course, but I preferred to take precautions when I could.</p><p>I used my Diagnostic Jutsu and confirmed what I had suspected before. It hadn't pierced her spine or hit anything immediately vital, which was good news.</p><p>"Alright, I'm going to pull this out and then heal it up," I said, grasping the kunai firmly. "You might want to look away."</p><p>They shook their heads, eyes fixed on my hand.</p><p>I probably should have insisted, really, but I didn't, pulling the kunai out with a short, sharp tug the same way that it had gone in so as not to cause any extra damage. Blood welled in the wound and spilled down her back as I ran through the hand seals for the Mystical Palm Jutsu.</p><p>The kids gasped as the wound knit itself back together slowly. It took concentration but it wasn't <em> much</em> more serious than anything else I'd healed. Eventually, all that was left was pink new skin and I absently wiped it clean before taping a bandage over it, just in case.</p><p>"There we go," I said, leaning backwards with a sigh.</p><p>Now I needed to set some traps and preferably make this little spot as defensible as possible.</p><p>I had only managed to rig a few very basic tripwire traps when I felt the incoming chakra. Four people. Three Chunin level. One Jounin level.</p><p><em> Shit.</em></p><p>Who were they after? Me or the kids? They already knew we were here, the skirmish by the lake had proven that.</p><p>I snuck back to the kids. "Keep your heads down," I whispered. "Whatever happens, stay calm, stay quiet. Understand?"</p><p>They stared at me, wide eyed. I didn't really have time to explain, because they were homing in on us. "Understand?" I repeated.</p><p>They nodded.</p><p><em> Good enough.</em></p><p>Carefully, I pulled my chakra in tight, a ball of adrenaline burning in my stomach and then faded carefully back into the trees. I cancelled my Resistance Seal, feeling lighter and freer as it faded away. If I had to go into combat alone, I wanted to be as ready as possible.</p><p>The group split up, the three Chunin level ninja staying in the trees and the Jounin one descending to land by the kids. I caught a glimpse of him, black cloth mask over his face, hair covered by a bandana, as I waited breathlessly.</p><p>Who to take out first? The lone Jounin or the three Chunin. I'd only get one shot, if I went for the Jounin, and fighting four at once would be too much. But if I went for the Chunin, I'd have to take them all out <em> silently</em> or he'd be alerted anyway.</p><p>"Well, well, well," he chuckled maliciously. "Look at what we have here."</p><p>I could feel the fear radiating off the kids.</p><p><em> Right. Decision made.</em></p><p>I ran through the seals for Earth Walking and sunk noiselessly into the ground. I <em> could</em> use jutsu while keeping my chakra compressed, it just took more concentration. A sensor type ninja might be able to pick up on the chakra used for a jutsu, but your average ninja didn't have that sensitivity.</p><p>If I'd approached him normally, he'd have heard me. I didn't doubt that. By the time they got to Chunin most shinobi would expect an attack from above. But even ninja forgot to think about underground.</p><p>I pushed forward, manipulating the dirt in front of me and almost <em> swimming</em> through it. I had to hurry - before he took them and left - but I couldn't be noticed. It was frustrating.</p><p>Then, I was beneath him. I lashed out, hands reaching upwards and breaching the surface, latching onto ankles and <em> pulling.</em> I yanked him downwards, rearing backwards and packing the dirt in around him as hard as stone.</p><p>"H-Hey! What the hell!" he shouted, struggling.</p><p>I surged out of the ground, gulping fresh air greedily. I scrambled in my kunai pouch, pulling out a knockout tag and slamming it down on his forehead - above the Hidden Rain forehead protector. A flick of chakra and he was out cold.</p><p>I would have taken that chance to breathe a sigh of relief, but there were still three ninja in the trees, stirring uneasily. They'd been expecting screaming, but not <em> his.</em></p><p>Plans flickered through my mind. They were up in the trees, so the same strategy wouldn't work twice. I didn't know how far away the rest were, so I wanted to have this done as quietly as possible.</p><p>I circled as widely around them as I dared, coming up to them from the back. Not a leaf whispered at my passing.</p><p><em> Don't try and evade a Mist shinobi on the water, or a Konoha shinobi in the trees</em> went the old saying. I hoped to prove it true.</p><p>"Should we go down there?" Ninja one whispered. I could see them, just, perched in the branches around a single, thick trunk. They were all dressed in a grey uniform, but not one I recognised from any Hidden Village.</p><p>"Do we have to?" Ninja two hissed back. "He creeps me right out."</p><p>"Quiet!" Hissed the third.</p><p>My shadow crept along the branches, aided by the abundant canopy. My fingers were busy tying loops of ninja wire to my weapons. This one was one of Sasuke's favourite shuriken tricks, though he did it without the added paralysis and with a Wire Dragon Jutsu to give it a bit of oomph.</p><p>Up the trunk my shadow crept, splitting into three unnoticed. It latched on; one, two three.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," I breathed, and let fly.</p><p>Shuriken whipped through the air, curving around the tree trunk, trailing silver wire behind them. Once, and then again…</p><p>The three shinobi cried out as they tried to evade and couldn't. I pulled tightly on the wire, pinning them to the tree, and cut the Shadow Possession as the outside force nearly yanked <em> me</em> off my feet as it did them.</p><p>One of them was quick enough, clever enough, to use a replacement jutsu before the wire got too tight. He hit the ground running, either to get a better position or to go for reinforcements, and I<em> couldn't</em> allow that. I yanked the wire tight, pinned it to the tree branch I was standing on with a shuriken, and was after him.</p><p>Over one branch, under another, a quick zigzag - bounce horizontally off a tree branch - and I was gaining on him. He knew I was there, but not where; every brace of thrown kunai missed by miles, and none of them had explosive notes or ninja wire attached. I'd checked.</p><p>I leapt off another branch, judged my distance and caught the next one with my hands, swinging around it and launching myself down. I slammed into his back, legs first, sending us both tumbling over the ground. I was expecting it. He wasn't.</p><p>He went sprawling and I rolled us over, no easy feat when he was bigger than me, and pinned him down. He lurched, trying to throw me off and I cocked my fist back and slammed it, hard and fast, into his jaw.</p><p>"Glass jaw," I panted, double checking that he was really out and not just faking before clambering off. It had been a stupid move, though, turning it into a grappling match. He was bigger than me, physically stronger than me… one wrong move and I would have been screwed.</p><p>I rolled him on his side and used ninja wire to tie his hands and feet together, making sure to get his fingers so he couldn't form hand seals. Trying to restrain ninja was an <em> art.</em></p><p>Then I backtracked to the two still furiously tied to the tree trunk and slapped knockout tags on them. No need for them to get free either.</p><p>The kids were where I left them, huddled next to their mother. I gave them the all clear, and dragged them to a new clearing away from people buried in the ground up to their necks. It was better that way. Then I told them to stay there with their heads down.</p><p>"Where are you going?" The girl asked, eyes tearing up.</p><p>"I have to go check on Shibuki and my friends," I said, as reassuringly as possible. "I'm sure they're fine."</p><p>I actually had great faith in Naruto and Sasuke's ability to deal with things, but that <em> didn't</em> mean they wouldn't need help.</p><p>And since Kakashi-sensei was gone, I was the only one left <em> to</em> help.</p><p>For lack of a better place to start, I made my way back to the lake. I was surprised, and not a little worried at what I found there.</p><p>All the villagers had been rounded up - tied up - and corralled by the lake. Even worse, so had Sasuke. He was hanging suspended from wooden arch. I could make out a metal sheen around his chest, and his arms were pinned up against his back.</p><p>There were three ninja in the clearing, all Jounin level. One, a young man with a blue blocky tattoo across his face, the second a young woman, and the third an older man.</p><p><em> Not. Good.</em></p><p>Naruto wasn't there, and neither was Shibuki which was a spot of hope. Naruto's chakra was somewhere behind the waterfall, and it seemed strong and vibrant. I hoped like hell he was alright, because this was definitely going to need both of us.</p><p>Maybe if I could meet up with Naruto…</p><p>Except…</p><p>I didn't know how to get to him. Oh, I could probably get behind the waterfall, but there was a slight problem of the waterfall being completely out in the open. They'd see me before I even got halfway there. If there were other ways in, I didn't know them.</p><p><em> Shit.</em></p><p>That was okay. It was fine. Don't panic.</p><p>There was no rush. Just wait for Naruto to come out. Wait, watch, listen.</p><p>"Why are you doing this?" One of the villagers shouted. "You were once our most respected Jounin, Suien!"</p><p>Okay, there was a name. Suien. Presumably a missing-nin from Hidden Waterfall. Well, that explained how they'd found the place.</p><p>"Have you come to take over the village?" Another asked fearfully.</p><p><em> Good.</em> I encouraged them. <em> Get him talking</em> . I couldn't see a single headband among them, so they were probably civilians. Hidden Village civilians, though.</p><p>"What would I want with this pathetic collection of huts?" Suien scoffed. "No, I've come for the Hero's Water."</p><p><em> Hero's Water?</em></p><p>The admission sent up a clamour from the civilians though. "Shibuki-sama would never hand it over!"</p><p>"He'd pour it out before he did that!"</p><p>"Maybe if he was a different sort of leader. But you forget; I was the one that taught him the ways of the shinobi. I know what he is," Suien said smugly.</p><p>This just kept getting better and better. Granted, I hadn't thought much of Shibuki myself, but presumably they'd elected him leader for a reason.</p><p>"Just where is Kirisame, anyway?" the woman muttered to the other ninja. I felt myself stiffen. Of course they would notice that their comrade was missing.</p><p><em> Stupid</em> …</p><p>He shrugged. "Probably stopped to have 'fun' on the way back. Doubt we'll get more than mangled corpses from him now."</p><p>"Suien won't like that," she said, but didn't seem to find the explanation odd. I dared breathe a sigh of relief. As long as they didn't go looking for him…</p><p>"I know you can hear me wherever you're hiding, Shibuki," Suien called, turning towards the waterfall. "Come out and bring the Hero's Water with you. Don't let this village suffer any more because of you."</p><p>I didn't know what the Hero's Water was - some kind of medicine or artefact? - but obviously Shibuki had it and Suien wanted it. Wanted it badly enough to storm the village and take people hostage.</p><p>"You wouldn't be thinking of pouring it out now, would you?" Suien asked, as if talking to Shibuki. There was no answer, but if Suien <em> had</em> been close to him, he probably knew how Shibuki would have reacted. "If someone came along and attacked the village, you wouldn't be able to defend yourselves, would you?"</p><p><em> Okay? A weapon then?</em> Except they'd said 'pour it out'. Which implied that it <em> was</em> a liquid…</p><p>"Time's running out, Shibuki," Suien called. "There's a limit to how long you can just sit out there. Bring out the Hero's Water, or I'll start killing your villagers, one by one." He paused. "Starting with the children."</p><p>He singled out one of the younger ones, maybe ten years old, and dragged her to the front.</p><p>"One minute, Shibuki," he shouted. Then he started counting down.</p><p>And.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p><em> Shit. </em> There was no way in hell that Naruto would stand by and just let this happen. Not if he could see it.</p><p>Then I had an idea. A crazy, stupid idea.</p><p><em> Oh, hell.</em></p><p>"Twenty seconds!"</p><p>I clasped my hands together and carefully built the fragile chakra construct around myself. "Transform!"</p><p>"You want the Hero's Water?" I asked, stepping out of cover, and the voice that came out wasn't mine but Shibuki's. "Come and get it!"</p><p>"Shibuki-sama!" The civilians cried. "Don't do it!"</p><p>The three ninja stared at me. I felt cold sweat sliding across my forehead. My left hand trembled in a perfect mimicry of Shibuki's nervous tick.</p><p>Funnily enough, it was really difficult acting terrified, even when you were. I was more used to trying to pretend I <em> wasn't.</em></p><p>Suien chuckled. "What a <em> hero</em> ," he mocked. "Hand it over, boy."</p><p>I lifted my chin. "Not- not until you let them go!"</p><p><em> Holy hell, what was I doing?</em> I shuddered. I was damn surprised that they hadn't seen through my transformation, and yet, if they did, I was screwed.</p><p>"You're not really in a position to bargain," he pointed out. Then his eyes narrowed. "What were you doing over there?"</p><p>And not behind the waterfall where he expected Shibuki to be. I thought fast. "If you knew where the Hero's Water was, you'd have got it yourself," I bluffed.</p><p>At the very top of my vision, I caught a flicker of orange. I consciously <em> did not</em> look upwards.</p><p>Suien smirked. "Or maybe you were trying to run away, weren't you, Shibuki? That was always your answer to everything. You truly haven't changed. How disappointed they must be."</p><p>I couldn't think of a retort to that. "Let them go," I said instead. "You don't need them anymore."</p><p>Suien shrugged, dropping the girl unceremoniously to the ground. I was right, though; they <em> didn't</em> need them. I was one person surrounded by three Jounin. My only advantage was that I wasn't the person they thought I was.</p><p>"The Hero's Water," he said.</p><p>I gulped. I had no idea what the Hero's Water really was, or what it looked like. I couldn't fake it. The civilians exploded into a chorus of 'don't do it's. Up above, I could feel Naruto's chakra building.</p><p>I stepped forward. My hand reached into my pouch, and I hoped that the Hero's Water was small enough to believably fit in there.</p><p>Suien narrowed his eyes.</p><p><em> Breathe.</em></p><p>I stepped forward again. And again. Every step carried me closer to him.</p><p>"Hand it over. Now," he said, face stony.</p><p>My hand whipped out, sending a volley of shuriken scattering through the air. My shadow lashed out underneath them, heading straight for him. He dodged, faster and more agile than I'd thought, and backhanded me straight across the face.</p><p>My saving grace was that Shibuki was taller than me. Suien's punch shattered the chakra construct of the transformation, but I was able to dodge it.</p><p>Naruto's chakra <em> surged</em> and then there was orange all around me, clones slithering out of ropes. He'd replaced all the civilians, sending them to safety inside the waterfall.</p><p>One of my shuriken, the barrage that had scattered wide and missed Suien so completely had had a different target all together. It neatly severed the rope holding Sasuke and dropped him to the ground.</p><p>For a moment, things looked up.</p><p>We'd run into strong opponents before and we'd always come out, if not better off, then <em> alive</em> . I'd only just taken out a Jounin through sneak tactics - but that was very, very different to a straight up fight. That there had been mitigating circumstances… that those opponents hadn't always wanted to kill us… we <em> knew </em> it but at the same time…</p><p>We were probably kind of arrogant.</p><p>We were strong, for Genin. Strength-wise, Sasuke and I probably ranked Chunin alongside Naruto. The three of us could <em> maybe</em> even be called high Chunin.</p><p>But there was still a hell of a difference between Jounin and high Chunin.</p><p>The three of them, quite effectively, proceeded to school us in that difference.</p><p>They were faster, stronger, could do better jutsu and do them <em> faster.</em> We were slammed with water bullets, slashed with water whips, in one memorable case nearly electrocuted, and they cut through the horde of Naruto clones with ease.</p><p>I had the feeling that the fight would have been over much, much faster, if only Suien hadn't wanted us to understand just how <em> pissed</em> he was.</p><p>Three against one, we might have stood some semblance of a chance. Three against three…</p><p><em> Yeah. No.</em></p><p>"Anyone got a plan?" I asked, a little desperate, as we were forced back to back.</p><p>"I think I gotta pull on furball," Naruto said.</p><p>I choked on a giggle. <em> Furball.</em></p><p>"Do it," Sasuke said.</p><p>Before he could, the water itself swirled up, spinning furiously like a tornado. I braced myself for the attack, but it swung outwards, slamming into the woman and second man. It sent them flying and they tumbled to the ground.</p><p>And didn't get back up.</p><p><em> Hallelujah, timely saviour!</em> I thought.</p><p>The water spun itself out, revealing visible blue chakra around… Shibuki. Huh.</p><p><em> He knows how to use the Eight Gates?</em> I wondered. That's what it <em> felt</em> like, that surging chakra, more than a person should have flowing through them.</p><p><em> Go figure.</em></p><p>"Leave them alone," he said.</p><p>"So, you used the Hero's Water?" Suien asked, mockingly, seeming not to care that his two comrades had just been taken out. "You know what it does to people of your constitution."</p><p>"Shut up," Shibuki ordered. He extended his hand. "Takigakure Style: Watercutting Sword." Water swirled around his hand, condensing and coalescing until it was blue and opaque, formed into a curved sword.</p><p>He leapt forward, sword slashing through the air in a flurry of blows.</p><p>Suien blocked every one. "Your chakra might have increased, but your moves haven't gotten any better. You've left your guard wide open. Just like you always did," he sneered.</p><p>"Sorry pal," I said, hands clasped together in the rat seal. "The only one here whose guard is open is you."</p><p>And then I spread my arms wide.</p><p>Suien did the same.</p><p>Shibuki's sword came down and cleaved his head straight from his shoulders.</p><p>"Well, that was anti-climatic," Sasuke said.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

Shibuki explained later. "They all called me a hero, but I was too scared… and… you all just jumped in without caring that they were stronger than you. To save <em> my</em> people."</p><p>We'd rounded up all the enemy ninja and stashed them in the surprisingly secure cells, and we'd found the kids and their mother that I'd left in the forest and brought them back to the village. We'd even been let inside, since Naruto and Sasuke had seen it anyway while they were scouting. It was pretty impressive. The entire cliff face behind the waterfall seemed to be hollow and riddled with tree roots that created a maze of passageways leading to a gigantic cavern where the Sacred Tree grew and all the houses were.</p><p>Shibuki had the look of someone who Naruto had given a talking to. Given that he'd gone against his stated cowardice to step into a losing fight, to the lengths of taking a chakra enhancing drug with potentially lethal side effects… a drug that had killed his father, no less…</p><p><em> Definitely the result of talking to Naruto</em> , I thought.</p><p>The Hero's Water did explain the mystery of how such a small village could hold its own. Shibuki had been understandably sparse with the details, but it seemed that the Hero's Water was, at the very least, an artificial way of replicating the opening of the Eight Gates. It wasn't exactly the same, but it increased the amount of chakra available at one point in time, even to the detriment of the body, so the comparison was apt.</p><p>It was the village leaders job to protect the Hero's Water and to dispense it in times of need to prevent the village from falling.</p><p>But <em> that</em> led to another question that had been bugging me ever since we set foot here…</p><p>"Shibuki," I asked tentatively. "Where are all your ninja?"</p><p>He blanched. "Ah, well, you see," he started, before wilting. "When I went to Hidden Leaf to discuss the alliance with the Hokage, I left the Jounin Commander in charge. I can't imagine why he would have left the village undefended."</p><p>I bit my lip. That didn't sound good at all, really. If it was a coup, they wouldn't have left but leaving the village undefended went entirely against the grain. Maybe they had left a guard but Suien had taken them out? But that still left the question of where the majority of the ninja were…</p><p><em> That</em> was the sort of question that made the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.</p><p>"Do you want us to stick around until you find out?" Sasuke asked casually, leaning against the wall.</p><p>Shibuki paused, then nodded. He might not have liked how much he was having to rely on us, but having <em> no</em> ninja around would be worse if there was a second attack. "Thank you," he said. "I need to go and talk to the villagers, so please, stay here."</p><p>He went off, either to reassure them, or to find out what was going on.</p><p>"So," I said, sitting down and stretching out my legs. "What did I miss?"</p><p>Naruto flopped down on the ground, sprawling out messily. "Not that much," he said. "Sasuke took care of the guys that jumped out of the waterfall, then Shibuki showed us how to get inside. Not the way we just came in, but a different way, and we had to swim through these tunnels… and we came up in the water over there somewhere." He waved his hand vaguely towards the lake around the Sacred Tree.</p><p>"Shibuki went off on his own," Sasuke picked up. "And we got ambushed."</p><p>"And you shoved me in the lake," Naruto grumbled, making a face.</p><p>"If you'd noticed the attack, I wouldn't have had to," Sasuke shot back, completely unrepentant. He even smirked. "I told him to go after Shibuki and I fought off the other ninja. The weaker ones were no problem, but the two Jounin caught me." He made a disgusted face. "I didn't even sense them coming."</p><p>"They were pretty tough," Naruto said, grimacing. "But yeah, I went after Shibuki and he had the Hero's Water and stuff. We were up in the wall somewhere, so I could see you guys through the gap. And I was with Shibuki, so I totally knew it wasn't him, but if I hadn't been I would have believed it," Naruto said generously. "It was a cool plan."</p><p>"It was reckless," Sasuke corrected.</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed. "But it didn't look like he was bluffing and I wanted to do something before he started killing the kids. I figured, if I could get you down we might have managed something until Naruto showed up. But I underestimated them…"</p><p><em> Or overestimated us.</em></p><p>It could have, in hindsight, gone very, very wrong. If, say, Naruto hadn't moved all the villagers. Or if they'd seen through my transformation. If Shibuki hadn't shown up…</p><p>Naruto shrugged, almost philosophically. "It worked. That's what counts."</p><p>"Yes, well," I said. "Here's hoping we don't get stuck in another fight like that too soon."</p><p>Sasuke nodded in agreement, a frown pulling on the edges of his mouth.</p><p><hr /></p><p>It was much later when the commotion of returning ninja roused me from the doze I'd fallen into. It wasn't exactly late, but the mantra of missions was <em> catch sleep where you can, because you don't know how long it'll be until your next chance.</em> Given that the situation looked so unstable, I wanted to recoup as much chakra as possible.</p><p>Naruto hadn't been sleeping, and Sasuke had come to alertness the same time I had, so we wandered out to see what was happening.</p><p>"-left two Chunin patrols," an older man was saying to Shibuki when we tracked them down. He had dark hair dragged back into a low ponytail and he was wearing a shinobi vest that was dark blue in colour, though similar in style to a Konoha vest, which was Hidden Waterfall's variation of the shinobi uniform. "I'll send a squad out to see what happened to them." He grimaced, clearly not expecting anything good to come of it.</p><p>There was a group of ninja arrayed behind him, spanning ranks from Genin to Jounin, though much more of the former. A few of them I thought I vaguely recognised from the Chunin Exams.</p><p>"But what happened?" Shibuki asked.</p><p>"We went to reinforce the border," the Jounin explained. "Hidden Cloud ninja have been incredibly active lately. They've come down through Land of Frost and Land of Hot Springs… I think they were just testing our defences but we don't know whether their goal is to head west or to go south through the Land of Fire. Either way it isn't good for us." He waited a beat. "The border patrols have been restructured, and there's another Genin team due back from a mission in the morning. The situation won't happen again."</p><p><em> Cloud ninja are active… go south through the Land of Fire…</em></p><p>… <em> Jounin only, emergency response…</em></p><p>We technically had a treaty with Hidden Cloud, but given what had happened to Hinata during the signing of it, it wasn't worth the paper it was written on.</p><p>I felt cold.</p><p>"Send people out after the Chunin patrols," Shibuki said quietly. "See if they can be recovered. And… someone to deal with the prisoners."</p><p>The Jounin nodded. "Will do. I'm putting everyone who was on the second shift off duty and Fu…" he trailed off, an uneasy expression on his face.</p><p>Shibuki twitched.</p><p><em> Interesting</em> , I thought, though it was detached. My mind was still stuck on…</p><p>"Aha," Shibuki said nervously. "You didn't leave her at the border? No, no, of course not. Never mind."</p><p>I cast a glance over the group, wondering who they were worried about. No one really stood out. Some of the ninja looked tired, some looked bored. Some had interesting weapons…</p><p>Then I saw her. She was standing away from the main group, by herself. Maybe fourteen, fifteen years old, wearing a white shirt and skirt, a red backpack, with mint green hair. And her chakra was <em> enormous. </em></p><p>I didn't know as much about the Jinchuriki as I would have liked. They hadn't really shown up in the show in any meaningful way, or at least not early on. I knew the ones that had featured in canon. And I now knew the ones that didn't hide what they were, like Roshi and Yagura.</p><p>There had been a Jinchuriki with green hair. Hidden Waterfall had a Jinchuriki. She had an inhuman amount of chakra.</p><p>The math wasn't perfect, but there was potential.</p><p>"She looks lonely," Naruto said, following my gaze. I glanced at him, just in time to see the firming of his expression.</p><p>Therefore, I wasn't <em> really</em> surprised when he marched over to her.</p><p>"Hi, nee-chan!" he chirped. "I'm Naruto Uzumaki, Konoha shinobi!"</p><p>She blinked at him, nonplussed.</p><p>Beside me, Sasuke sighed. "That moron…"</p><p>"Ah, leave him be. If he wants to make friends, it's fine," I said with a shrug.</p><p>"As long as he doesn't annoy her into trying to kill us," Sasuke returned dryly.</p><p>Which was a valid outcome, really. Naruto's special brand of annoying grew on most people pretty quickly, but there were still people that he rubbed the wrong way and he didn't always know when to back off.</p><p>"Oh, there you are," Shibuki said, finishing up with the Jounin and approaching us. "I was just going to come looking for you. As you can see, our ninja have just returned. You can stay tonight, if you like, and I'll have someone escort you to the border tomorrow." He looked around. "Where is Naruto?"</p><p>The second he caught sight of Fu his face sort of froze. Then he smiled weakly, looking more like the twitchy person that we'd escorted here than the determined shinobi that had been peaking through recently. "Ah, well, I guess we can talk to her now."</p><p>He approached her cautiously, footsteps loud to ensure she heard him coming. "Ah, hello, Fu," he said. "I see you've already met Naruto. I was, uh, going to ask if you could escort them to the border. Tomorrow, I mean, because it's late now and they'd have to travel in the dark. If you don't mind, that is?" He sounded so incredibly nervous and not at all like a village leader assigning a mission.</p><p>Given his reaction to her, I wondered if the mission was really just a way to keep her busy and out of the village. It certainly wasn't because we <em> needed</em> an escort, or that he didn't trust us. That would have been redundant by now.</p><p>Fu just gave a careless shrug. "Sure, I guess."</p><p>Naruto beamed. "Awesome. That's so cool, nee-chan! You can show us all the really neat spots on the way. We passed this inn when we came here, with a little teashop and the sign said that they had a special on ramen, but Kakashi-sensei said we didn't have time to stop which was lame, because you should <em> always</em> have time for ramen." He nodded, to himself.</p><p>"I guess?" Fu said hesitantly.</p><p>"Well," Shibuki said, shifting nervously. "I'll just, uh, leave you to it. I have stuff to do. Yeah."</p><p><em> Okay. Weird.</em> I could possibly have written Shibuki's nerves off as him being Shibuki, or possibly as teenage male confronted with teenage female, but the way the other ninja were giving her a wide berth told a different story.</p><p>What that story was wasn't so clear, but I had a suspicion.</p><p>"So what time should we leave?" I asked.</p><p>"Whenever you're ready," Fu said, unconcerned.</p><p>"After breakfast?" I suggested. "We're already late so there's no point in delaying longer than necessary."</p><p>In which case we probably could have - should have - left earlier. But I liked my sleep, even in a strange place, and I wasn't going to pass up a chance to have <em> actual food</em> for breakfast.</p><p>And also, that would mean we would pass the teashop-with-the-ramen around morning tea time.</p><p><em> I am so weak.</em></p><p>"So, Fu-nee-chan?" Naruto asked, bouncing on his toes. "Can you show us around? We didn't get to see much before. Hey! Have you ever been to Konoha?"</p><p>Fu looked around, possibly for help or someone to tell her what to do. "Sure," she said eventually. "And no, I've never been to Hidden Leaf."</p><p>"Well, if you do, you should totally come and find me," Naruto decided. "And I'll take you to Ichiraku. They make the best ramen, ever. And the bridge where we always meet up, which is really nice even when it's <em> really early</em> and, oh, and Cherry Blossom Avenue, which is just a bunch of cherry blossom trees, but Sakura and Ino are always talking about how pretty it is, so maybe you'd like it too?"</p><p>Sasuke and I mostly trailed behind them as Fu showed us around, and tried to deal with Naruto's excited, lets-be-friends chatter. There really wasn't much to see, because as an actually <em> hidden</em> village it obviously didn't get trade and probably had to source food and materials outside. We put in a comment or two when Fu was starting to look too overwhelmed. She seemed like a nice girl, if overly passive and indifferent.</p><p><hr /></p><p>As promised, after breakfast the next morning we got ready to leave. Quite a crowd gathered to see us off, mostly the villagers we'd rescued yesterday, though there were a few curious or appreciative shinobi amongst them.</p><p>"Bye nee-chan," one of the two kids I'd protected in the forest yesterday said quietly.</p><p>"Hey, what's with the long faces?" I said cheerfully, chucking her gently under the chin. "Smile."</p><p>"Fu is scary," the boy said, voice equally low. He kept glancing at where she was standing, off to the side.</p><p>"Bah, she doesn't seem all that scary to me," I said, contradicting him gently. "And you two know what really scary things are like now, right? And you were really brave in the forest, so don't be scared now."</p><p>I couldn't, truthfully, say outright that Fu wasn't dangerous. She didn't seem it, now, but you never knew someone fully at the first meeting. And well, all shinobi are dangerous, if you catch them at the wrong time.</p><p>"Oh, yeah. That was <em> really</em> scary," the girl said.</p><p>"See?" I said, before straightening. "Anyway. I've got to go now. So take care and pay attention in class, right?"</p><p>I jumped back to rejoin my team, and we left, waving behind us. Fu was silent.</p><p>"That was weird," Naruto said, frowning, as we took to the tree tops. "They were all nervous and twitchy and stuff. I thought they liked us."</p><p>"It's not you," Fu said, voice blank. "They're afraid of me."</p><p><em> Fu is scary.</em></p><p>"That's silly, nee-chan," Naruto objected. "Why would they be scared of you?" He was completely and utterly sincere, and even Fu could tell, glancing at him out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>She sighed, then said resolutely, "because I'm a demon."</p><p>"No you aren't," Naruto refuted with certainty.</p><p>She double-checked, expression bemused. That really wasn't the answer she was expecting. She glanced at me, then Sasuke. I'd already suspected, and Sasuke just shrugged.</p><p>"Yes, I am?" she said weakly, obviously not used to arguing <em> this </em> part of it.</p><p>"No, you aren't," Naruto repeated patiently. "Demons have, like, teeth and claws and they growl a lot and are really mean. You're people-shaped and really nice, so you're not a demon."</p><p>Fu stopped, and expression of frustration on her face as she turned to him. "People shaped, huh?" she whispered, before closing her eyes. There was a surge of chakra - strange chakra, inhuman but nothing like Kyuubi or Shukaku - and wispy tendrils of chakra burst from her sides, beating up and down with enough force to lift her off the branch.</p><p>"There," she said, throwing it out there, face set grimly like she was waiting for the accusations. "I took this burden on when I became a Genin. And now, because of it, people from my own village - people I <em> grew up with</em> - treat me like a stranger. No, like a mad dog about to bite!"</p><p><em> She wants him to know,</em> I realised. <em> She wants to push him away before he gets too close.</em></p><p>Naruto's mouth dropped open. "You have <em> wings</em> ! That is so cool!"</p><p><em> Fu's</em> mouth dropped open. She spluttered.</p><p>"You're a Jinchuriki," I said calmly, as soon as I could trust myself not to laugh. It probably wouldn't go over well. "The Seven Tails, right?"</p><p>"Yes," she said.</p><p>Naruto blinked in surprise, glee fading into determination. He lifted his chin. "Me too."</p><p>Fu double-checked again. Yep, she hadn't seen that one coming. It was a good thing we weren't moving, or she might have actually fallen off the branch.</p><p>"I'm the Jinchuriki of the Kyuubi," he said. "So, when I say 'you're not a demon', I know what I'm talking about! I'm not one, you're not one and Gaara isn't one either! Some people might treat you like you are, but you just have to find people who look past that and see <em> you</em> . Those precious people… they're what's worth fighting for!"</p><p>"I see," Fu said, blinking at him, then at us.</p><p>I smiled. "You know, I have to wonder if you're magnetised or something, Naruto. Of all the people we could run into, it'd have to be another Jinchuriki."</p><p>Naruto chuckled and rubbed the back of his head. "I'm just awesome like that," he decided.</p><p>Sasuke rolled his eyes. "Moron," he said, but as fondly as Sasuke ever said anything. "Are you coming or what? We don't have time to stand around all day, you know."</p><p>"Sheesh, don't get all worked up about it, Sasuke," Naruto complained, and we started moving again. "Hey, Fu! Do you know what this means? It's like you really are my nee-chan!"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Having confirmed that Fu was a Jinchuriki, things got a little trickier. Not outwardly, because Naruto took the opportunity to <em> bond</em> and not even half an hour later had Fu smiling; a little bewildered, but smiling all the same. He seemed ecstatic to meet another Jinchuriki, and one who wasn't trying to kill him at that.</p><p>But I had information that it was really kind of important for Fu to know. Namely that Akatsuki were after her.</p><p>And I was pretty sure that that was <em> classified</em> information and the village would <em> not</em> be happy if I happened to tell her about it.</p><p>Which was frustrating. The ninja world horded information and secrecy was the name of the game, but that tendency was a double edged sword. In this case, I was pretty sure that that secrecy was one of Akatsuki's greatest weapons.</p><p>It seemed to me, that the more people knew about Akatsuki, the better the Jinchuriki could be protected. And the more the other Jinchuriki were protected, the fewer resources they could commit to hunting Naruto and the safer he would be.</p><p>There were probably flaws in that logic somewhere. But still.</p><p>How could I <em> not </em> warn her? Knowing that they <em> would</em> hunt her and that she <em> would</em> be killed… how could I not?</p><p>The difficult part was <em> how</em> . Being as how I was certain that the village wouldn't <em> like</em> me giving this information away, I kind of didn't want to get caught doing so.</p><p>And didn't that thought just make me cringe. 'Doing something the village wouldn't like' sounded an awful lot like treason, even if it was just something like telling someone they were likely to be attacked.</p><p>We reached the teashop about mid morning, like I had thought we would. It was a quaint little place, just off a well travelled crossroads, that looked like it got it's fair share of visitors.</p><p>"Time for a break," Naruto declared, bounding inside.</p><p>Sasuke paused in the doorway, and looked back at me. "Coming?" he asked.</p><p>I shrugged. "I just want to talk to Fu for a second," I said. "Order me whatever looks good, okay?"</p><p>He looked at me for a second, dark eyes probing, then nodded silently and continued inside.</p><p>Fu looked wary.</p><p>I gestured at the bench on the opposite side of the worn dirt road. It was far enough from the shop that we wouldn't have to worry about eavesdroppers if we spoke quietly.</p><p>"Naruto is a good person, you know?" I said conversationally, settling into the seat.</p><p>Fu perched beside me, gingerly. "I know," she said, eyes fixed on the teashop. "There's no one in Taki quite like him."</p><p>I laughed a little. "I don't think there's anyone else in the world quite like Naruto."</p><p>Naruto could make <em> strong</em> bonds. Despite the absence of fighting, I hoped that he'd formed one with Fu, too.</p><p>"I want to keep him safe," I admitted. "But it's hard. You wouldn't think that Jinchuriki make good targets, would you?"</p><p>Her eyes turned to me. "No, you wouldn't," she agreed carefully. Fu was a shinobi too, and I hoped she was good enough to pick up on what I wasn't saying.</p><p>"I guess only people who counted themselves as also that strong would knowingly attack a Jinchuriki," I mused. "S-rank, maybe."</p><p>"There aren't many of those," Fu said.</p><p>"Enough," I said. "Enough that go missing-nin, even. Hmm, I know one from Konoha, even. Uchiha Itachi is S-rank." I tapped a finger to my lips. "And Kisame Hoshigaki from Mist."</p><p>"I've heard of them," she said carefully. "They sound very strong."</p><p>"Mmm," I said. "Imagine what people like that could do if they got together. Scary thought, isn't it?"</p><p>"It's a good thing they don't," she said mildly.</p><p>"It would take someone even stronger to make them," I agreed. Hmm, that was getting a bit off track. I tilted my head back to stare at the sky. "We're lucky that we had such nice weather today. Did you see the sunrise?"</p><p>She blinked, thrown. "No."</p><p>"It was quite pretty," I said. "All pinks and reds. I hope it's not a bad omen. There's a saying, you know, <em> red sky in the morning, shinobi's warning. </em> A red dawn. Akatsuki." I blinked and laughed, a little shakily. "Maybe it is a bad omen. If I saw someone in a black cloak with red clouds on it, I'd probably run away."</p><p>I glanced at her. She caught my gaze and held it.</p><p><em> Listen, listen, listen!</em></p><p>I blinked. "Ah, listen to me rambling. Just forget I said anything. What I was going to say was, I'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news about Naruto. Obviously, not many people know about you and we'd like to give him as many advantages as possible."</p><p>"I don't talk to many people," she said.</p><p>"True enough," I said easily, standing and stretching. "But we all have to keep secrets at some time or other. I mean," I said, with another false laugh. "Even Shibuki asked us to keep the location of the village secret."</p><p>A reminder. And one that smelt very faintly of blackmail at that. Something sour twisted in my stomach.</p><p>This was also the dangerous part. There was no doubt in my mind that she was stronger than me, even without the added Jinchuriki part. Everything I'd said had been carefully worded as hypothetical, as random assumptions, with no concrete basis. But it had still passed information along. I needed her to keep silent about it.</p><p>"I wouldn't want to do anything that would endanger Naruto," Fu agreed, standing as well. "Or my village." There was a faint killing intent emanating from her. Yeah, I got the message.</p><p>"No," I agreed. "No one wants that."</p><p>We walked inside the teashop, blinking at the change from bright light to dimness.</p><p>"Hey!" Naruto said cheerfully. "There you are. What took so long?"</p><p>"Ah, just girl talk," I said, waving the question off.</p><p>We didn't stop for long, just long enough for a snack and cup of tea, before we were off again. The border between Land of Waterfall and Land of Fire wasn't far, which was where we left Fu.</p><p>"Keep yourself safe, okay?" I said, as seriously as I could.</p><p>She gave me a long look. "And you," she said finally.</p><p>She left, heading back for Hidden Waterfall and leaving us in there. The weather was nice, the sun was shining, and the birds were chirping. It was very peaceful.</p><p>I wondered how much of that feeling was a lie.</p><p>"Think we can double time it back to Konoha?" I asked, a little uneasy about being out here alone. I could have been wrong; I <em> hoped</em> I was wrong. But if I wasn't…</p><p>"Baa-chan will understand why we're late, right?" Naruto asked, rubbing the back of his head.</p><p>Sasuke smirked. "You know, with Kakashi-sensei gone, you're the one in charge. That means the one she'll blame is you."</p><p>Naruto's face looked like it had got caught between <em> hey, yeah</em> and <em> oh, shit. </em> "But… she'll understand… right? Right?"</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

Shukaku, obviously, and I think it was said that Roshi knew Son Goku's name but never used it. I'd have to check and see what Fu actually said during that scene to see where she fits on the scale…</p><p>Anyone who's looking for more Naruto SI's should check out Butterfly Wings by Quantum Physics.

Thanks guys!</p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p><em> .</em></p><p>Chapter 55</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Confidence is the foundation of friendship. If we give it, we will receive it. ~ Harry E. Humphreys, Jr. </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The Missions Desk was buzzing when we got back. Tsunade-sama wasn't there, which wasn't that unusual; she <em> was</em> the Hokage, and only spent a small portion of the day there, after all.</p><p>"Team Seven reporting a mission complete," Sasuke stated when we got to the desk.</p><p>Naruto set the mission scroll down on the table. "Kakashi-sensei got called back to Konoha," he said. "For some emergency meeting?"</p><p>"Emergency… oh, he probably got called to the Border Outpost," the Chunin behind the desk said. "I wouldn't worry about it. Was there anything else?"</p><p>"Yeah," Naruto said uneasily. "Other stuff happened. We picked up at least one extra mission, but probably two."</p><p>The Chunin raised an eyebrow but didn't really comment. "Alright. Go to briefing room four and someone will come and take your statement."</p><p>It probably said something about us, that the missions where we <em> didn't </em> get debriefed specially were less common than those where we were.</p><p>I followed the boys out of the room silently.</p><p>Konoha had a lot of outposts spread throughout the Land of Fire - and potentially in other places, though the official word was 'not'. Some of them were small, like the ones around Konoha itself, while others were reasonable sized buildings or towers with several rostered teams, holding cells and medical facilities. The biggest outposts, though, were the Border Outposts. They were responsible for the border patrol, quick response teams when shinobi ran into trouble on missions, and other varied functions. The outposts weren't infallible, as evidenced by the invasion at the Chunin Exams, but they <em> were</em> the first line of defence.</p><p>An emergency at a Border Outpost was almost <em> certainly</em> an attack.</p><p>"Alright?" Sasuke asked, eyebrow raised.</p><p>"I'll tell you later," I said.</p><p><em> When I actually know what's going on,</em> I added mentally.</p><p>We had to wait quite a while in the briefing room before one of the missions room shinobi could come and debrief us. I was uncharacteristically impatient for it to be over with, but I had nothing on Naruto, who starting tapping an <em> absolutely irritating</em> rhythm on the table.</p><p>I liked to think I had patience. I dealt with Naruto on a regular basis, after all. But I was contemplating strangling him by the time the door opened. Judging by the spasm of Sasuke's eye, he probably was, as well.</p><p>"Finally," Naruto said, exhaling noisily and scooting his chair forward. "Man, you guys must be really busy out there."</p><p>"A bit, yes," the Chunin said. "So lets get this out of the way." He sat down and flipped his file open. "So, you're Team 7, under Kakashi Hatake and you were escorting Shibuki back to Hidden Waterfall. What was the issue?"</p><p>"We arrived in Hidden Waterfall safely, with no complications," Sasuke began after a pause. "And were offered a second mission to assist helping clean the waterways, which we accepted."</p><p>"That's when Kakashi-sensei got his message bird and left," Naruto picked up. "He went off alone and told us to finish up before coming back here. So we were doing that, then we got attacked."</p><p>The Chunin's eyebrow jerked up.</p><p>"A group of missing nin ambushed Hidden Waterfall and took the villagers hostage. They demanded… a village artefact, of some kind." Sasuke shrugged. "We assisted Hidden Waterfall, engaged the missing-nin and Shibuki killed the leader."</p><p>It was a concise, <em> very concise</em> , summary of the mission.</p><p>"How many missing nin were there?" the Chunin asked, pen darting along the paper.</p><p>"There were three four-man teams, of at least Chunin level and led by a Jounin and one more Jounin additionally, so thirteen," Sasuke said. We'd actually added that up and been <em> surprised</em> at the number. Both at how large it seemed against the three of us, and how small it was for fighting a village. Luckily, most of them had been taken out before the fight by the lake, or things might have gone even worse for us.</p><p>The Chunin coughed. "Four Jounin and <em> nine</em> Chunin?" he asked, disbelief colouring his voice.</p><p>Really, I don't know why he was <em> that</em> shocked, since we hadn't really mentioned that the Hidden Waterfall ninja hadn't been about.</p><p>"Hidden Waterfall has them prisoner," Naruto said, a little defensively. "The ones that survived, anyway."</p><p>"Right, right," the Chunin said hastily. "Thirteen. And then you returned?"</p><p>"We stayed the night," Naruto admitted easily. "Then we had an escort to the border."</p><p>"We got home without complications," Sasuke added dryly.</p><p>"Excellent," he said drolly. "Right, we'll draw those up as two separate missions. A D-rank cleaning and an A-rank hostage rescue." He twitched, just a little. "Fill out the forms and bring them to the desk. And don't forget to write up mission reports for them."</p><p>"We know the drill," I assured him.</p><p>We did as asked, and I left my team mates with an invitation to dinner before disappearing home. I could have combed through the Genin clearance announcements to find out what was going on, but why would I when I had a much better source of information?</p><p>"Tadaima!" I called softly, stepping out of my shoes.</p><p>Mum appeared in a flurry of movement and nearly knocked me off my feet when she pulled me into a hug. "Shikako! You're home! Are you hurt? I was so worried that you were going to get caught up in the fighting."</p><p>"I'm fine, I'm fine," I said. "We just got back about an hour ago and I don't even know what's going on. Kakashi-sensei got called off for <em> something</em> and… it sounds pretty bad…" I gave her a hesitant look.</p><p>Mum was a retired kunoichi. More than that, she was the wife of a Clan Head and the Jounin Commander at that. She kept up with what was happening.</p><p>"You aren't wrong," she said, sombrely. "Go, put your things away, and I'll fill you in."</p><p>That wasn't a particularly promising start, really, but I did as asked, and we sat down in the living room with cuts of steaming green tea.</p><p>"Is there fighting at the north-east border?" I asked bluntly. It was what all the evidence was pointing to.</p><p>"Yes," Mum said, equally straightforward. "Hidden Cloud made a major push against the border. The outpost managed to hold them off and send out for reinforcements. It was a priority order, so all Jounin and upper level Chunin who were capable of responding dropped their missions to answer it. I was afraid that with your team you would end up there. Land of Waterfalls certainly isn't very far away."</p><p>I shivered at the thought. As this mission had shown us, we probably would have just been cannon fodder. No wonder Kakashi-sensei had left us behind.</p><p>"They're still fighting?" I asked, because mostly ninja fights were over quickly. Even when you were talking about <em> battles</em> rather than individual fights, the principles were the same. Long term, head to head, knock down and drag out battles were rare.</p><p>"It seems so," Mum replied. "A second wave of reinforcements were sent out to back up the first responders, and your father went with the third wave yesterday."</p><p>I nearly spilt my tea. "Dad's there?" I asked, alarmed. I don't know <em> why</em> the thought bothered me so much.</p><p>"He is the Jounin Commander, you know," Mum said, a little tartly. "It makes tactical sense to have the strategist nearby to decrease the amount of time it takes to get new orders and information."</p><p>I nodded. "I know."</p><p>"It's unlikely he'll be on the front lines," she said, softer. I knew she was worried too.</p><p>She probably had a better idea of what it was like out there than I did. The only experience I had with that scale of fighting was the Chunin Exam Invasion, and for most of <em> that</em> I'd been off fighting Gaara and missed the worst of it.</p><p>A terrible thought occurred to me. "Where's Shikamaru?"</p><p>Had Mum thought I'd end up there because…</p><p>She shook her head. "On an escort mission to Shinjuku-gai. It's only the three of them, though. Asuma was sent out with the second wave."</p><p>The hand clenching my heart eased. "He'll be fine. That's not very far away at all." It wasn't even outside the Land of Fire.</p><p>I took a sip of my tea, marshalling my thoughts. "What do they want?" I asked, switching back to the original topic.</p><p>"If only we knew," Mum said wryly. "It's only a skirmish so far but there are rumours that it might blow up into a full out war. I can't imagine Tsunade-sama wants <em> that</em> so early into her reign."</p><p>Fighting happened among ninja villages, covert and overt. Fighting bad enough to be called a war? Well, that happened too. But if Konoha and Hidden Cloud went at it, you could almost bet that the other villages would be dragged into it and it would turn into the Fourth Shinobi War.</p><p><em> That… didn't happen…</em></p><p>I frowned. There hadn't been serious fighting between nations in the series, had there? None that had made the story, anyway, which wasn't always the same thing. I <em> couldn't</em> have changed something enough to have caused this, could I?</p><p>I mean, I'd barely managed to affect the things I <em> knew</em> about.</p><p>Dinner that night was a subdued affair, even with Naruto there. I'd hissed a warning at my team mates not to mention the 'extra' missions, because I was pretty sure Mum didn't need anything extra to worry about right now.</p><p>"So what is it?" Sasuke asked, after the table had been cleared off. "You've been acting weird since we got back. No, before that…"</p><p>"Ah," I said. "You know how Sensei got called off, and then the missions desk guy said he was at the Border Outpost? There's fighting there, with Hidden Cloud. That's where Dad is," I added, aware that they would have noticed his absence.</p><p>"Fighting?" Naruto said, puzzled. "What kind of fighting?"</p><p>I shrugged. "I don't know. It sounds pretty bad, though. They had to call in a lot of Jounin, so…"</p><p>"That's… not good," Sasuke said, apparently not knowing how to sum it up, either.</p><p>"What does it mean?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"For us?" I said, thoughtfully. "Probably not much, right now. They won't send rookies like us out there unless things get much worse." In which case, they might. Naruto had already proven himself to be surprisingly competent, and with Kyuubi… "We'll have to take missions without Kakashi-sensei, that's for sure. For the village? That depends on how long this lasts. Having so many high level ninja tied up will affect our ability to take missions. Which means our income will go down. There's injuries and casualties, which will overwork the system." <em> And mean people are dying.</em> "Less resources to use in other places. The other villages might decide we can't fight two battles at once and attack. If it escalates into war… well. Then it's war."</p><p>We were silent for a beat. I started setting up the shogi board, just for something to do.</p><p>"It's weird," Sasuke said. "That they waited so long. You'd have thought they would have attacked early, if they were trying to take advantage of the Invasion."</p><p>I frowned, rolling a shogi piece through my fingers. "Maybe it's not," I said slowly, "because they think we're weak. Maybe it's because they think we're strong."</p><p>There was a pause."Hidden Rock sent teams to scout because they thought we might be weak after losing the Hokage. But Hidden Cloud waited long enough to know that we aren't, not really. We're not at full strength, not yet, but we're not an easy target either. But… we are getting stronger."</p><p>"I don't get it," Naruto said, puzzled.</p><p>"Hidden Cloud is currently ranked as the strongest of the hidden villages. They're stronger than us. But for how long? Think about the kind of showing that we put on at the Chunin Exams, and how we rebuffed the Invasion. At the rate we're growing, in five years, in ten years? Where'll we be then?"</p><p>"They're trying to crush us back down while they have the chance," Sasuke said thoughtfully.</p><p>I shrugged. "It's a theory. Or who knows, maybe there was some secret mission that none of us know about that stirred them up. There's plenty going on in this village that I don't know about."</p><p><hr /></p><p>For all the ominous portends, nothing had actually changed in Konoha itself. Ninja came and went and fighting happened, so it was nothing <em> too</em> out of the ordinary. It was probably a different story in the departments that dealt with the issue, but from the outside, everything seemed normal.</p><p>I stopped by the hospital. Lee was still there, which meant it had been a very long hospital stay for him. As far as I knew, he'd had his surgery and was recovering well.</p><p>I knocked on the door. "Hi, Lee. Oh, and Tenten, right?" I added, seeing that he already had a visitor. I <em> knew</em> she was Tenten, but it wasn't like we'd talked or anything.</p><p>"Right," Tenten said. "And you're Shikako." She glanced curiously at Lee. "I didn't know you two knew each other."</p><p>"I was just stopping by to see how Lee was," I excused. "I haven't been here for a while."</p><p>He beamed. "Much better! Tsunade-sama is an excellent medic. I have several more weeks of physical therapy before I can be returned to active duty." He looked, well, like himself, with green jumpsuit and orange legwarmers, and Lee wore bandages as equipment <em> anyway</em> so it was hard to tell if they were medical.</p><p>Tenten smiled. "I think they're only keeping him here so he doesn't injure himself training," she added.</p><p>Which sounded about right. Not that they could really stop him, but it probably curbed <em> some</em> of his outrageous tendencies.</p><p>"Ah, well," I said. "I'm sure it'll be over sooner than you think."</p><p>"Yosh! And if I work even <em> harder</em> , I will be out of here sooner!" Lee practically <em> sparkled</em> .</p><p>I traded half-amused looks with Tenten.</p><p>"I look forward to it," she said. "Really. With Gai-sensei gone, Neji and I are just getting shuffled around. It'd be nice to have the team together again."</p><p>Neji was probably in higher demand, too, with his Jyuuken skills and Byakugan.</p><p>"We should spar sometime," I suggested. "If you're free."</p><p>Sparring was kinda the ninja equivalent to going out for coffee or catching a movie. Everyone needed to train, and training with others (preferably of the same level) was always better, so it was practical as well as a social exercise. It was something we all needed to do, so it was a sure connection to make. 'Hey, I haven't seen you in a while, wanna spar?' or 'We've got a few hours, wanna spar?'</p><p>You could tell a surprising amount about someone by fighting too, if you paid attention. Had they improved, or gotten sloppy? Were they injured, tired, sick, not focusing? How was their gear; well looked after or rusty and old? And if so, were they taking care of themselves to the same degree? Why not? Were they stressed, depressed, on the verge of a mental break down? How were they handling the stress of the fight?</p><p>And, well, you needed to be able to trust someone to spar with them. We used live steel, and real techniques. You had to trust them to pull back if you couldn't dodge, to abort the fight if things got too dangerous.</p><p>"I- sure," Tenten said, blinking in surprise. "I've just been training by myself."</p><p>"You are so inspirational Tenten!" Lee said. "When I return to training, I will convince two, no <em> three</em> fellow ninja to spar with me!"</p><p>"Ah, you do that, Lee," Tenten replied, too used to his ways to make a big deal out of it.</p><p>We chatted for a little while longer, before Tenten invited me to Team Gai's training grounds. It was a little more immediate than I'd expected when I made the suggestion, but it wasn't like I had anything better to do.</p><p>"How do you want to do this?" she asked.</p><p>I considered. "To a decisive victory? And try to avoid injuries." Well, 'decisive victory' was sometimes hard to measure, especially if you were pulling attacks, but I didn't really see the point of getting injured during training.</p><p>"Sounds good to me," she said with a quick smile.</p><p>We paused, surveying each other, and the atmosphere switched from friendly-casual to battle-ready. I felt hyped, adrenaline starting to surge through my limbs, heart beat already picking up in anticipation.</p><p>My shadow lashed out, zipping straight across the clearing for her. She was expecting it, leaping backwards up into the trees, hands pulling out weapons and throwing them in a single fluid movement. I caught the gleam of silver, pulled out my kunai and deflected the first wave, thrown in a scatter pattern that would have hit ankles, knees, thighs, torso, shoulders and upper arms in places that were debilitating but not fatal, and more precisely, made it difficult to deflect them all quickly because of the range.</p><p>The second wave, released about half a second after the first, I dodged instead. Then I saw the flicker of white paper across the canopy, as a scroll was thrown across the clearing, unrolling as it went and Tenten leapt after it.</p><p><em> Oh, hell no.</em></p><p>"Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall!" I raced through the seals and slammed my hands into the ground, raising a fairly tall and stable defence. None too soon, I heard the rapid fire thunk of many, <em> many</em> sharp and pointy objects hitting it. Even more went sailing past the edges of the wall, embedding into the dirt, which would have prevented me from dodging in either direction.</p><p>Tenten circled around through the trees, to try and get around my Earth Wall.</p><p><em> Time to abandon the low ground</em> , I thought. It gave her far too much of an advantage.</p><p>I ran through quick calculations in my head and pressed my hand to the ground. "Touch Blast," I murmured, watching as the ink spread out with my chakra.</p><p>I noted with satisfaction that my speed at setting the jutsu had improved. Having a name - something to sum up and recall all the parts involved - helped tremendously, even if it wasn't the most exciting of names. I'd contemplated having something whimsical like Blooming Flower or Gentle Fireworks, but simple, short and to the point worked best.</p><p>I darted backwards, to the edge of the wall, as it blew. It was a weak blast, very little heat or damage, but it threw <em> a lot</em> of dirt and dust into the air and obscured sight.</p><p>I moved.</p><p>Trees cast shadows, but ironically, shadow possession worked best at ground level. Being up in the branches meant that my shadow had to go up and down to reach it's target. The more the shadow had to travel, the greater the chance that it would be noticed. However, fighting in the tree branches gave me a much better position against Tenten's thrown weapons, so I went high.</p><p>Tenten obviously knew that the dust cloud was a distraction, and was on high alert for an attack.</p><p>It was easy enough to make an Illusionary Clone and have it take the most unexpected route out of the dust. That is, leap straight for Tenten, head on.</p><p>I think I was starting to base my idea of 'unexpected' on 'what would Naruto do?'.</p><p>She reeled, just for a second, before withdrawing two handfuls of weapons and sniping it down. They went straight through it, but were perfect shots otherwise. That gave <em> me</em> time to circle around the clearing and pinpoint her.</p><p>I ran through the hand seals for the Vertigo genjutsu, dropping it on her just as I threw a handful of shuriken. I could see the genjutsu hit, in the way she stumbled, but she drew a handful of senbon and threw them with unerring accuracy through the centre of the shuriken, pinning them to the tree.</p><p><em> One hundred percent accuracy, huh?</em> It was an impressive shot to be sure, even without the balance affecting genjutsu.</p><p>"Kai!" She shouted, releasing the genjutsu as I dashed across the intervening space between us. I swept low, aiming to kick her legs out from underneath her, but she jumped over it, lashing out and forcing me to block.</p><p><em> Fast.</em> I hadn't released my Resistance Seal, or enhanced my muscles, so I was hardly working at full capacity. But Tenten was faster and stronger than expected. Given her team mates and Sensei, it shouldn't have come as a surprise - I did remember watching her fight Temari - but her preference for long range combat created assumptions.</p><p>We traded blows, blocking and dodging, and working in the three dimensions provided by the forest. Tenten's scrolls were less useful when there were so many obstacles, and when I kept pressing in close she didn't have time to withdraw them anyway.</p><p>We rebounded off the tree trunks and the undersides of branches, flipped around them to gain surprise, twisted and turned, mostly managing to block each other though there were a few attacks that slipped through guards.</p><p>She vanished in a burst of speed, coming in low with a rising kick to my stomach. I'd seen the move before from Lee, and given that Naruto and Sasuke had both managed to copy it, I didn't doubt that Tenten had her own variation. I quickly used the replacement jutsu on a nearby log and impressed an illusion overtop of it.</p><p>She followed it up, shadowing underneath it and pulled two scrolls out. They curled through the air, arching over and around the 'body' she was attacking.</p><p>A flare of chakra through the scrolls and…</p><p><em> That could have been messy</em> , I thought, as Tenten disengaged and the perforated log plummeted to the ground.</p><p>She tensed, looking around warily, kunai in each hand. She wasn't far from me. If I could keep her attention for a second or two…</p><p>I made a quick hand seal, and another Illusionary Clone shimmered into existence, in the opposite direction to where I was. It moved so that the very barest of edges was visible around the tree.</p><p>Tenten grinned and took aim -</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," I said. I raised one of my empty hands up to my neck, and Tenten mirrored me, only she was holding kunai.</p><p>"I give," she said after a pause and assessing her options.</p><p>I let the jutsu unravel. "Good fight," I said politely, before surveying the metal scattered ground. "Need a hand picking those up?"</p><p>She laughed nervously. "Ah, yeah. Thanks. That's one of the downsides of using a lot of weapons."</p><p>We set to work gathering them all up. They were everywhere, lodged in trees, scattered over the ground, and we'd covered a surprising amount of distance during the fight.</p><p>By the time we made it back to the clearing, we both had armfuls of weapons to be resealed. It was… awkward.</p><p>"I'll have to spread the scrolls out," Tenten murmured, before stopping to stare at the Earth Wall. She sighed.</p><p>"Alright?" I asked.</p><p>"Ah? Oh, yeah, fine," she dismissed. "Just something someone said…"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"'Any half decent ninja is going to be able to avoid those'," she quoted. "'And those that can't dodge will have some kind of technique to protect them.'" She ran a hand through her bangs.</p><p>I winced. It was, well, kinda true. The head on way she tackled the fight probably didn't help in that matter, either. "Well, eh…" I frowned. "Did Sasuke say that to you? It doesn't sound like a Neji quote and Lee would never…"</p><p>She blinked, startled. "Well, yes."</p><p>I smiled, apologetically. "Sorry. He's usually nicer than that." Okay 'nicer' might have been stretching it. 'Less deliberately cruel' maybe.</p><p>"I know," she waved it off. "It wasn't a good time for us, either. But he did have a point."</p><p>"Kinda hypocritical, though," I pointed out. "He does use shuriken techniques a lot."</p><p>"But he has more than just that. He has ninjutsu and taijutsu as well."</p><p>"Yeah, variety is good," I agreed. "I'm not saying that you <em> can't</em> make it with just one skill but… you have to be clever about it. I don't know, I like having options, which is why I use more than just the clan jutsu. Shikamaru does fine with nothing else, but he's a lot smarter than I am. Maybe if you mixed it up? Sasuke is living proof that shuriken, ninja wire and fire make an awesome combination. Think about what you could do by adding like… a wind jutsu behind them, or something."</p><p>She blinked, then looked thoughtful. "That's an idea. Yeah."</p><p>I smiled, pleased to have been some help, and touched the Earth Wall, sucking all the chakra out and letting it crumble back down. The various weapons clattered to the ground.</p><p>Tenten was spreading the scroll out across the grass and placing the weaponry over their respective kanji to reseal them. I brought a pile of them over, and well, was basically nosy and looked over what seals she used.</p><p>"Do you do a lot of sealing?" I asked curiously.</p><p>"I can't carry this many weapons otherwise," Tenten said with a shrug.</p><p>That wasn't really what I meant, but it probably answered my question. She only used it for sealing scrolls.</p><p>"Mmm. I just noticed that you used a different seal pattern for these and these," I said, pointing.</p><p>She glanced at it. "Kuukan Seals work better for objects that are bigger than the paper," she admitted. "But I don't need them for small things like kunai."</p><p>"The fold the space more efficiently," I said. "But have a higher chakra cost to set."</p><p>She looked surprised. "You use seals?"</p><p>"A bit," I said, and hesitated. Should I? <em> It's my book. I wrote it, I can lend it to whoever I want.</em> "I have a book on seals, if you'd like to borrow it."</p><p>"Thank you," she said, surprised at the offer. "Gai-sensei has been teaching me some, but he's not an expert or anything."</p><p>"Not many people are," I said wryly. "It'd be nice to have some one to talk to." Our focuses might be different, but imagine what Tenten would be like if she managed to whip up a hammerspace or something.</p><p><em> Mind you, I wouldn't mind a hammerspace myself…</em></p><p>"And, you know," I added, figuring I might as well go all the way. "If you're interested in medical jutsu, some of us girls get together for a study group."</p><p>"I wanted to learn medical jutsu once," she admitted. "I wanted to be like Tsunade-sama. I wasn't very good at it," she added, self-deprecatingly.</p><p>"It's a difficult subject," I agreed. "But you could still come anyway. Hinata can't use the jutsu either but there's still things that she can do."</p><p>"I'd like that."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Tea Arc: Chapter 56</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Nemesis Jedi - rofl, what would I do with out you? Hot Tamales, indeed. XD</p><p>I keep wanting to put an honorific on Jirocho's name, but I don't really know what to use. I think in the sub they used Oyabun, and in the dub it's 'boss' so… yeah.</p><p>Distorted Reality by Hanako H is a Hyuuga SI that's just been put up, wherein the SI isn't actually familiar with the Naruto-verse at all.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 56</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you. ~ Eric Hoffer</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I wasn't wrong in my assumption that we would be taking missions without Kakashi-sensei. It made Mum purse her lips in disapproval, because quite apart from going alone, it also meant we'd had very little down time between missions.</p><p>It couldn't be helped though, and we weren't injured or incapable of going, so we went.</p><p>"So what do you have for us?" Naruto asked eagerly, as we lined up by the Missions Desk. "Are you going to send us out to fight?"</p><p>"Don't be an idiot!" Tsunade snapped. "You wouldn't last five minutes out there!"</p><p>"Don't underestimate us. Don't you know the kind of missions we've been doing?"</p><p>"Of course I know, brat!" She said, exasperated. "That's why I'm giving you <em> this</em> mission. If you could just hold your tongue for two seconds…" She grumbled softly to herself. "You might not realise it, but sending a newly promoted Chunin off with two Genin isn't <em> done.</em> By rights, you'd either stay with your Jounin-sensei until you had some goddamn experience, or you'd be stuck with a more experienced Chunin squad. The fact that I <em> am</em> sending you off should tell you how well you're doing."</p><p>It also kind of said just how pushed they were at the moment, but Naruto looked vaguely appeased, the frown fading from his face.</p><p>"Right, no more complaints?" She asked pointedly. "It's a B-rank escort mission. Of course, it could develop into an A-rank mission if you run into trouble," Tsunade continued. She might have been trying to warn us, but given Naruto's expression it seemed to be working more as an enticement. Maybe she knew that.</p><p>"So, who do we escort?" Sasuke asked, cutting straight to the heart of the mission.</p><p>"I don't know," Tsunade said, leaning back in her chair.</p><p>"Hold on, what do you mean, you don't know?" Naruto blurted out.</p><p>"Every four years the Land of Tea holds a dedication ceremony at the Great Todoroki Shrine. And each time, we're asked to escort a runner that will participate in the race that's part of the ceremonies. This year, the messengers who were bringing the request were attacked before they could get here," she explained.</p><p><em> Land of Tea?</em> <em> Race?</em> That… sounded familiar actually. After so many missions where I <em> didn't</em> remember, it was rather strange. And in some ways it was both a good thing and a bad thing. Good, because I knew where we were in the timeline now and had an inkling to how this mission would turn out. Bad, because <em> I knew where we were in the timeline now.</em> We had seemed to spin off, and I had thought maybe… things were different…</p><p>Team 7 had gone to the Land of Tea just before Sasuke's defection.</p><p><em> Something </em> else<em> to worry about…</em></p><p>I'd known it was coming. It was the entire point of Orochimaru marking Sasuke in the first place. That didn't mean it wasn't worrying.</p><p>I closed my eyes, just briefly; barely more than a long blink. First this thing at the border and now Sasuke to worry about, and I'd managed <em> nothing</em> about Akatsuki, and I was <em> trying</em> , I was -</p><p>"You'll be heading to Port Degarashi to meet up with Jirocho. He'll fill you in on the details." Tsunade folded her hands together to prop up her chin and regarded us seriously.</p><p>"Jirocho?" Naruto frowned, then seemed to click. "Ah! That gambler guy we met!"</p><p>"That's all I know. Now, no wasting time. Get going." She waved us off.</p><p>We bowed hastily and ducked out of the room.</p><p>"It doesn't look good," Sasuke murmured. "If the <em> messengers</em> got attacked…"</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed, forcing my mind back on topic. "We should expect to encounter enemies. There's probably something more to the ceremony and race, if the runner <em> needs</em> an escort."</p><p>I knew a bit about the Land of Tea in general; it was located to the south-east of Land of Fire and consisted of a peninsula and two long islands. It's main export was obvious, and it was fairly prosperous as countries went. It had no standing ninja village, and the Daimyo's power was pretty weak, with most of the towns and cities having a ruling 'family' or 'organisation'. There were sometimes clashes between Families, but the majority of them never devolved into outright fighting, preferring to stay in the realms of back room politicking.</p><p>"Whatever it is, we'll handle it," Naruto said confidently.</p><p><hr /></p><p>It was dark when we got to Port Degarashi. We made our way to the destination given in the mission scroll; a very nice, traditional looking house. We were ushered inside and directed to a meeting room, complete with tatami mat floor and shrine.</p><p>"Hey, boss!" Naruto greeted casually. "Team Seven is here to fulfil the mission. You don't have to worry anymore."</p><p>Jirocho chuckled, sounding plenty amused. He was an old guy, with dark grey hair, but still solid and competent looking, dressed in simple blue and grey yukata. "You haven't changed at all, I see."</p><p>Naruto tucked his hands behind his head and grinned. "Yeah, well you haven't changed much either, big guy."</p><p>"Pleased to meet you, Jirocho-dono," I murmured, bowing politely. "You have the details for our mission?"</p><p>"Yes, yes," he clapped his hands together. "Please take a seat and I will explain. Every four years we hold a dedication ceremony at the Great Todoroki Shrine using the Ryoko jewels. At first it was just a rededication of the jewels, then it became a festival, and a race, with the winner of the race being hailed a great hero. In recent years, however, what once was a friendly contest has become much more serious. For generations Port Degarashi has been divided between two Families; the Wasabi and the Wagurashi. Both Families wanted control of the town, which naturally led to disputes. These disputes became increasingly violent, sometimes resulting in all out battles. The rest of the townspeople were caught in the crossfire. Many were injured, or worse. Finally, in an effort to end the cycle of violence, our Daimyo called on both sides to get together and come to an agreement. Henceforth, control of the town would be decided not by street brawls but by a competition."</p><p>"The race," I realised. Which meant it was a hell of a lot more important that 'just a race'.</p><p>"Indeed." He smiled. "Four years ago, the Wagurashi beat us soundly by hiring a ninja and we found out they've done the same thing this year."</p><p>"And that isn't against the rules?" Sasuke wanted to know. It did sound a little dodgy.</p><p>"The race has no rules, merely a starting point, a check point and an end point. The first one to reach the end wins, it's as simple as that. The race starts at dawn at the harbour. The first leg of the race is done by boat, and the competitors sail to Nagi Island," Jirocho explained. "The Ryoko jewels are held at the Modoroki Shrine, and each runner has to pick one up and carry it to the finish line, which is at the Great Todoroki Shrine on Ouzu Island."</p><p><em> Sailing. Great.</em> But it wouldn't be long, which was the only saving grace. And I made a mental note to look at the maps of the local area tonight, to see if I could trace out a path. A race wasn't a good time to get lost, though hopefully the runner would know where he was going. If we had more time, I'd probably suggest scouting the course, but that wasn't an option.</p><p>"So who are we supposed to be escorting?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"A young man from my Family, Idate," Jirocho answered. "I asked him to come here and meet you so he should be here soon."</p><p>There wasn't really that much more to ask. It seemed pretty straightforward. There was a race that had a lot hinging on it, we had to protect the runner, and there were enemy ninja who wanted to stop him winning.</p><p>We did end up meeting Idate. He was perfectly polite - under Jirocho's watchful eye - but the look he gave us was less than welcoming. He was a few years older than us and fairly tall and lanky. He had more chakra than a regular civilian, but it wasn't enough for me to think that he was a ninja.</p><p>Or rather, anything more than a dropout Genin. Yeah, I remembered that. Still, it wasn't exactly <em> that</em> much of an issue.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The following morning we were woken early and proceeded to the harbour with the rest of the Family. It was dark and still cold, but it seemed like the entire town had turned out to watch the start of the race. There was music, and fireworks, and plenty of cheering.</p><p>"Whoa, I had no idea it was such a big deal!" Naruto exclaimed. "So where are the ninja the other side hired?"</p><p>There was the strong pulse of a shinobi's chakra hidden among the dim glow of the civilians. It wasn't out job to go on the offensive though. We were just supposed to protect Idate. "They're here," I said.</p><p>"I don't care what you guys do," Idate said, as he went to line up by the starting block. "But whatever happens, just stay away from me."</p><p>"Say what?" Naruto protested.</p><p>"I've got a race to run. I don't want you in my way." It was almost a valid reason, but the bitter tone of voice belied it.</p><p>"That's what we're here for," I said, as calmly as possible. "To stop people getting in your way."</p><p>His lips pressed into a flat line and he muttered something that sounded like 'shinobi' as he turned to face the water.</p><p>"Attention, attention," The loudspeaker chimed. "The Great Todoroki Shrine race is about to begin! Running for the Wasabi Family; Idate Morino!"</p><p>"Morino?" Sasuke whispered, obviously recognising the name.</p><p>"Running for the Wagurashi Family; Fukusuke Hikyakuya. Runners, take your marks!"</p><p>Fukusuke was older and taller than Idate but that didn't necessarily mean he was faster. In fact, if the Wagurashi were confident in him, they probably wouldn't have hired ninja to take out the competition.</p><p>The two crouched into a runners start as the gates to the dock swung open. Over the water, we could see the sun beginning to rise.</p><p>"GO!"</p><p>They burst into action, tearing out the gates and then towards the waiting boats. Well, Fukusuke did. Idate curved around, running along the dock and parallel to the water.</p><p>"What the-" Naruto started. "The ocean is the other way! Where the heck do you think you're going, you idiot?"</p><p>"We better go," I said, cutting through the side of the arena. Hey, I wasn't part of the race, I didn't have to go through the gate.</p><p>"What's he <em> doing?</em> " Sasuke asked, vexed.</p><p>"Maybe he's got a plan," I offered, quietly. "Nothing in the rules says he has to leave from Port Degarashi." I was vaguely aware that sailing relied on water currents and wind gusts, which occurred in patterns or channels or whatever the correct terminology was. The best path across water, therefore, wasn't necessarily a straight line, but the path that took advantage of them.</p><p><em> If we're going to be dealing with boats so often, I really have to start learning this stuff</em> , I mused.</p><p>The flat concrete of the dock ended and gave way to dirt paths. We followed Idate up into the trees instead of curving around the bay. Or well, we ran in the trees, and he ran along the ground beneath us. He was <em> fast</em> but not ninja fast, and at least two of us had put heavy effort into training our speed.</p><p>"Jeeze, what's the big deal? Why the heck did you come this way?" Naruto asked, as we bounded through the tree branches.</p><p>"Will you shut up? It's none of your business anyway, kid," Idate retorted, dismissively, casting an annoyed glance upwards.</p><p>"What's with the attitude, pal?" Naruto barked, voice gaining an edge.</p><p>"I said shut up!"</p><p>I rolled my eyes in exasperation.</p><p>We ran on, through the trees and onto a path that wound up the side of a cliff. It was barely wide enough for two people side by side, so Sasuke and I dropped back without comment.</p><p>Then I felt it. The slimy crawl of foreign chakra in my system.</p><p>"Genjutsu," Sasuke muttered.</p><p>I pulsed my chakra, shaking off the illusion, then frowned. "Release!" I said, clapping my hands into a seal. This time, the web of chakra shattered, vanishing to show the real landscape.</p><p><em> Double layered huh?</em> Tricky. You dispelled the first layer and then got caught by the second.</p><p>Which did tell us something about the kind of ninja we were about to face. Strategic thinkers. Clever. Good at genjutsu - layering wasn't easy.</p><p>"Are they making their move?" Sasuke murmured quietly.</p><p>I frowned. "I can't sense anyone around. Either they're hidden from me, or that was just a delay tactic." They would have had to have been close by to set it, but that didn't mean they'd <em> stayed</em> .</p><p>"Well, it is a race…" Sasuke said.</p><p>Which meant delay tactics <em> mattered</em> . If they could slow us down, it was the same as stopping us. And every little bit added up.</p><p>Idate seemed sure of his path, and though Naruto kept asking, he didn't let us in on where he was going. I kept checking to see if the ninja were close by, and to make sure they hadn't set traps or anything across our path. Nothing showed up.</p><p>We crested over a hill and found ourselves entering a small hidden bay. Almost immediately, my eye was drawn to the boat prepped and ready on the water.</p><p><em> Planned it all along, huh?</em></p><p>Idate didn't head straight for the boat, but turned towards the small shack set by the forests edge.</p><p>"Nagi Island?" Sasuke asked, shading his eyes with a hand. Out across the water, you could see the outline of land.</p><p>"Yeah," Idate said, losing some of his aggression. "And the halfway point. We can probably get there in an hour from here."</p><p><em> Thank god</em> , I thought. The less time on a boat, the better.</p><p>He knocked on the door. "Hey, gramps. It's me, Idate of the Wasabi!"</p><p>"Hey there, I've been waiting for you," the old guy rasped as he answered the door. "I've got things all ready for you. There isn't a faster boat around."</p><p>"Thanks a lot," Idate said.</p><p>"It's not a problem, Jirocho has done a lot for me, over the years. Just make sure you don't lose to the Wagurashi, I've had about all I can stand from them."</p><p>"Don't worry about a thing," Idate said confidently. "I may be the underdog but I won't lose. You can count on it."</p><p>With a sigh, I joined the others in clambering onto the boat and getting it moving.</p><p>"So what happened to Port Degarashi?" Naruto asked, anger forgotten in favour of curiosity.</p><p>"At this time of year, there are some pretty strong seasonal winds blowing hard across the sea," Idate explained. "Back at the starting point, I could see the clouds. I noticed the wind was blowing towards us. On top of that, from that bay, the current flows directly onto Nagi Island. It's much faster." He tapped his temple. "You should use your head a little more."</p><p>"Hey!" Naruto protested immediately.</p><p>Idate turned away. "I can't believe someone like you made Chunin. Standards must have gone <em> down.</em> "</p><p>I thought about how Naruto had fought Gaara, the sheer danger of that fight. Let alone his actual Examination fight. "Oh, trust me," I said dryly. "Naruto deserved his promotion."</p><p>Naruto went a little pink.</p><p>"You're from Konoha, aren't you?" Sasuke cut in, eyes dark. "I thought I recognised your name." And picked up on what Idate probably hadn't meant to say about the Chunin Exams. Gone <em> down</em> implied that he had a baseline to make that judgement from.</p><p>"Huh?" Naruto frowned. "Idate… Morino. Oh, wait. Morino. Ibiki Morino. He was the proctor for the First Exam!"</p><p>Idate spun back around. "What did you say? My brother? He's alive?"</p><p>"Of course he's alive, why wouldn't he be?" Naruto said. "He threw such a curveball at me, the tenth question in…"</p><p>Idate ignored his anecdote. "Seriously? He's really alive?"</p><p>I nodded. "He is. Does this have something to do with the reason you left?"</p><p>Technically, I suppose Idate was a missing-nin. He'd abandoned the village. Given that he hadn't even changed his name, it was a little surprising that he was still around. Then again, if he was just a Genin, it might not have been regarded as worth chasing him down.</p><p><em> And, also, he has a brother highly placed in the Intelligence Division</em> . That didn't necessarily mean Ibiki was covering for him. But it <em> could</em> .</p><p>"I… It… That's none of your business!" He shouted. "I don't have to tell you anything!" There were definite signs of panic on his face.</p><p>"Shesh, take it easy," Naruto said, flapping his hands. "What are you getting so worked up about anyway?" He had a puzzled frown on his face.</p><p>"You don't know anything!" Idate shouted.</p><p>"Then why don't you tell me!" Naruto shouted back.</p><p>"I left Konoha behind. It's nothing to me anymore," Idate said, turning away. His hand clenched around what looked like an ornate switchblade. "All I want to do is win this race and pay Jirocho-sama back."</p><p>"Well, whatever," Naruto said dismissively, but I could see that he was curious.</p><p>The rest of the trip was mostly quiet as we headed for the island. It was only as we were closing in on the harbour that things started to happen.</p><p>"Three incoming," I said. "Five o'clock." I narrowed my eyes at the ocean. "Stealth jutsu that can cover a whole boat. That's pretty impressive." They were coming at us from an angle, and had managed to get fairly close without being noticed, especially considering that there was nothing to hide behind. It was strange that they had managed to catch up to us, consider that <em> we</em> hadn't even known we were coming this way.</p><p>"What should we do?" Sasuke asked, staring over the side of the boat. "Wait them out?"</p><p>We didn't really have much choice. We could hardly leave Idate alone to go and attack, which was always the case when body guarding.</p><p>"What a sucky time for it to start raining," Naruto grumbled, swiping his hand across his face.</p><p>I frowned. "That's not water," I said, staring down at the black drops on my hands.</p><p>"It's oil," Sasuke finished. We shared a look.</p><p><em> Not good.</em></p><p>With the glint of the sun off the water, and the angle at which they were attacking, it was hard to see the projectiles as they were fired. Sasuke knocked the first flaming arrow out of the air with a well thrown kunai, sending it sizzling into the water. But even then we could tell that we were fighting a losing battle. They could fire several arrows at once, and even when we were successful, we were depleting our weaponry stocks.</p><p>And then water clones started rising out of the ocean.</p><p>"Hey, those are the guys from the Chunin Exam!" Naruto exclaimed.</p><p>They were. The three Hidden Rain ninja that we'd taken a scroll from. And obviously, they remembered us too.</p><p><em> Hidden Rain…</em> Pein's base of operations. I'd been focusing on tying Akatsuki to Rain, but maybe I was going about it the wrong way. Maybe I could tie <em> Rain</em> to Akatsuki…</p><p>It was a thought that had be percolating in my head ever since I'd seen the missing nin in Hidden Waterfall. I hadn't had the chance to question them, too focused on the ambush and the fight that it hadn't even crossed my mind.</p><p>The middle of combat wasn't the best time to be thinking of it. And the question of <em> how</em> to manage it remained…</p><p>Then it happened. With an ominous 'thunk', a flame tipped arrow slammed into the deck. The oil caught fire almost immediately, spreading rapidly across the ship.</p><p>"The fire is out of control; we'll never put it out. We're going to have to swim for shore," I said, sounding surprisingly calm. I really felt like cursing. "We need to keep them from following us."</p><p>"Right," Naruto said, forming a cross seal, with eyes narrowed. "Idate! You go on ahead, we'll stop these guys and catch up."</p><p>"You can forget about it!" Idate said, voice tight with panic. "What, do you think I'm stupid? You three just probably want to use me as a decoy!"</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Naruto shouted, voicing the frustration that made me want to scream.</p><p>"You guys want them to focus on me, while you get the heck out of here!" He accused.</p><p>"Stop talking nonsense!" Naruto demanded.</p><p>"I said, forget it! I don't trust ninja!"</p><p>"Get out of here, already! We don't need you getting in our way!" Sasuke ordered. It was harsh, but true.</p><p>"Fine!" I snapped. The mission trumped my half-formed plans of taunting them into speaking. It was doubtful that I'd get anything useful out of them anyway. "I'll go with you. You two should be able to handle yourselves, right?"</p><p>Sasuke nodded curtly. I didn't think they would have much trouble. They hadn't been <em> that</em> tricky to deal with last time.</p><p>"I won't!" Idate shouted.</p><p>I didn't waste time arguing with him, snaking my shadow towards his feet and launching us both into the water. I could have run on top of it, but it wasn't a skill most Genin had, so I doubted that Idate could. Keeping low would also maximise the cover that we got from the smoke. Swimming it would have to be.</p><p>I looked over my shoulder, and through the thick black smoke pouring off the boat, I could see a horde of Naruto's launching themselves across the water. I smirked grimly. They would certainly regret initiating <em> that</em> fight.</p><p>Idate was, thankfully, a strong swimmer. That was good, because the closer we got to the shore, the more the current and waves insisted on trying to slam us into unforgiving rock. I would have popped out of the water and dragged us both in safely, but I could feel someone already there waiting for us.</p><p><em> Now, what kind of ninja travels with a group of Genin?</em> I thought wryly, feeling a brief flash of relief that I had decided to come with Idate. Not that me vs. a Jounin was a particularly compelling thought, but it was better than nothing.</p><p>Maybe if I used Earth Walking? But no, the ground was solid rock. Even <em> if</em> I could manage to make it malleable enough to travel through, it would be slow and it would <em> chew</em> through my chakra.</p><p>That was out.</p><p>The shoreline we were being swept closer to had a jutting bay of flat rock, surrounded by higher, steeper cliffs. There would be no circling around.</p><p><em> Damn</em> .</p><p>There was no avoiding it, no picking a better field of battle, and no ambushing him. Double damn.</p><p>I let the waves sweep me closer to the rocks, using chakra to stick to them and haul myself out of the water. Idate scrambled up behind me.</p><p>"Well, well," someone chuckled. "Now isn't this interesting?"</p><p>He was a tall guy, wearing a form fitting blue and white bodysuit with dark green hair. He was wearing a Hidden Rain forehead protector, and carrying a combat umbrella.</p><p>"Aoi Rokusho," Idate said, sounding like a curse.</p><p><em> Of course, you know him</em> , I thought sardonically. <em> Why not?</em></p><p>But I recognised the name, too, from out of the Bingo Book. Aoi Rokusho. Chunin missing-nin from Konoha who had defected to join Hidden Rain. Some people did that, avoiding the hunter-nin by seeking protection with another village. Konoha had obviously not cared about him enough to cause an issue over it.</p><p>"I was expecting you to run away. It wouldn't be the first time," Aoi said carelessly. "Or does your little friend not know about that?" His eyes glinted wickedly.</p><p>"Shut up!" Idate shouted. "That was all because of you!"</p><p>"Now, now, Idate," Aoi tsked. "I guess I couldn't expect you to have told her; you've never trusted anybody in your life. You've never thought of anybody but yourself. You abandoned your village, betrayed your brother, and it's still all about you, isn't it? You just don't care what happens to anyone else. A person like that really doesn't deserve to live."</p><p>"Your opinion hardly matters," I cut in. "Idate. You have a race to run. Get going."</p><p>"Going to run away again, Idate?" Aoi smirked. "How very like you. Don't think that you can get away though, I am so much <em> more</em> than you."</p><p>"Idate. Go!" I barked.</p><p>Aoi narrowed his eyes and twirled his umbrella. I knew those things could shoot senbon by the dozens, and I wasn't particularly keen on experiencing it.</p><p>I dropped my Resistance seal, channelled chakra through my muscles and grabbed Idate, rushing us to the other side of the bay with a burst of speed that was almost Body Flicker level. Running that fast wasn't easy when you were carrying someone that was bigger than you, but it was worth it as I watched the stone ground tear up under the hail of senbon.</p><p>I shoved Idate towards the path leading up the cliff. "Go. Jirocho is counting on you, remember?" I said, snapping him out of whatever daze he'd fallen into. His hand clenched around his switchblade.</p><p>"Right," he nodded, swallowing heavily. He darted off, picking up speed, and I settled in to guard the path, kunai in each hand. Now I was the one stalling and blocking the path onwards.</p><p>"It's pointless, you know," Aoi said. "Fukusuke will already be at the shrine. There's no way that Idate can win."</p><p>I studied him with hooded eyes and shrugged. "You can't call the race over until someone has crossed the finish line."</p><p>He glowered.</p><p>I was starting to get a feel for him. He was the kind of person that used psychological attacks, that fought verbally as much as physically. Smug. Arrogant. Self-entitled. Superiority complex.</p><p>"Are you really going to try and fight me?" he asked, tone rife with disbelief. "You're only a Genin, you don't stand a chance. Why don't you just run off home now and keep yourself safe? I'll even let you go." He sounded so very patronising.</p><p>"Sah," I drawled. "You're only a Chunin, right? The difference isn't that much."</p><p>His eyes bugged out, jaw clenching. <em> Bingo. Direct hit. You can dish it out, but you can't take it, can you?</em></p><p>"I am a Jounin of Hidden Rain," he said poisonously. "You will <em> regret</em> that." It seemed like he was touchy about his rank. Well, when you found an exposed nerve, the only thing to do was to jump up and down on it repeatedly.</p><p>"But only a Chunin of Konoha. I guess they must have been desperate, right? To take you in and all, let alone give you a title," I kept my voice light and sweet. "Maybe you even bought them off? Sold them village secrets? I guess they might have given you a rank out of gratitude. Do they have a special name for that, like Honourary Jounin?"</p><p>Special Jounin were those that had Jounin level skills in an area of specialisation. There was no such thing as Honourary Jounin. He might have really been a Jounin in skill, but boy, was that stirring him up.</p><p>"You little bitch," he swore, spinning the umbrella. I dodged, as chakra surged and brought together the water spray in the air and slammed it down where I had been standing. He was breathing hard, not from effort, but from anger. "I deserved that rank! I always <em> deserved it!"</em></p><p>I spared a moment to wonder if riling him up was <em> really</em> the best way to go about this, but it was a little late now.</p><p>"How long do you really think you can keep this up?" He taunted. "You're all alone here. Did your little friends run into trouble?" He mocked. "Did you leave them behind? Just … run away?" His smile was sharp and cruel. "How pathetic."</p><p>"Did that happen to you often?" I asked innocently, dodging again and again. His swings were getting wilder. "I guess nobody liked you. I can see why. Did you have to go to Rain to make some new friends?"</p><p>He made a low noise, like a growl, and threw down the umbrella. "I'll show you," he promised darkly, pulling out something. "This… this is why they took me. The Sword of the Thunder God, used by the Second Hokage himself."</p><p>It pulsed with chakra and ignited.</p><p>I stared at it, barely able to keep my jaw from dropping.</p><p><em> That… is a lightsaber. </em> I narrowed my eyes.</p><p><em> Lightsaber. </em></p><p>He did not get to keep that.</p><p><em> <strong> Lightsaber</strong> </em> <em> .</em></p><p>I was a ninja. I knew there were jutsu and weapons of every description and ability and more. And yet, some things were so deeply ingrained, like the cultural belief that the coolest weapon in the world was made of light and went zshooshm.</p><p>"They must not have cared about it that much," I managed. "Since they let you keep it. And I really doubt that you knew anything important, right? Too <em> unimportant</em> to be trusted with and really <em> good</em> secrets. You're <em> nobody.</em> Maybe you traded something else, hmm?"</p><p>He crossed the distance between us <em> fast</em> . I blocked the first swing of his sword with my kunai and winced at the low grade shock that they transmitted to me. I jumped back, but I wasn't fast enough, and the blade seemed to <em> spit</em> a web of lightning at me.</p><p>I hit the ground rolling, muscles seizing as the electricity ran through them.</p><p>With a grunt, I forced myself back to my feet. The lightning blade wasn't really good for me; it forced all the shadows back away from it and it <em> moved.</em> A regular blade was dangerous enough in taijutsu, but a blade that could do distance attacks was a much worse prospect.</p><p>At least he was fighting me and not chasing after Idate. That was something.</p><p>"I guess…" I spat out. "With hair like that, you look like a girl from the right angle."</p><p>His face changed interesting colours and he lunged forward again, swinging the lightning sword like a bat. I launched two exploding tags at him and scrambled out of the way. My hands were still trembling and I <em> didn't</em> want to be hit with that again.</p><p>He was good and <em> mad</em> though. I darted away, throwing handful after handful of weaponry at him. Some had explosive tags attached, some had strings of ninja wire strung between them - anything I thought would slow him down.</p><p>"Who could it be though?" I taunted. "You're hardly worth anything, and Hanzo has no love for the Leaf."</p><p>Pein had killed Hanzo at some point, though I didn't know when, to wrest control over Hidden Rain. The problem was that Hidden Rain was so isolationist - and competent about it - that no one had <em> known.</em> It had probably been before the series started, but regardless, it wasn't a fact that was known to anyone else.</p><p><em> Tie Akatsuki to Rain, or Rain to Akatsuki… either way…</em></p><p>The taunt missed it's mark and Aoi's face twisted into a smug smirk, as he wrested control of the verbal battle. "Oh, you know <em> nothing</em> ," he gloated. "No one follows that decrepit old fossil anymore. We have a new god now.</p><p><em> Bingo.</em></p><p>"I didn't take you for the religious type," I said wryly. He must have felt in control of the fight, despite my taunting, because I hadn't even tried to attack him yet. The Sword of the Thunder God was a strong weapon, and it made him even more certain of his own victory, but like all weapons it was only a tool and therefore only as good as the one who wielded it.</p><p>"All of Rain lies in his grasp. But you don't <em> know</em> about that do you? Poor little girl, so blind to the world around you. Why even bother?" His voice turned syrupy sweet. "Why don't you just give up and run away home?"</p><p>He was <em> really </em> irritating. I liked to think I was pretty level headed; I didn't normally <em> argue</em> with people like this. He wasn't jumping on any exposed nerves like he obviously wanted to be doing, but that didn't mean he wasn't annoying me.</p><p>"The one who should give up," someone growled. "Is <em> you!</em> "</p><p>Naruto and Sasuke both hauled themselves out of the water and onto the flat rock.</p><p>Aoi's eye twitched. "It doesn't make any difference how many of you there are. You'll never defeat me," he declared.</p><p>"Never say never," I said, grinning at the boys. Obviously they'd finished up with the Genin team easily enough. It meant conversation time was probably over, but I had <em> something</em> .</p><p>"Shadow Clone Jutsu!" Naruto called, fingers in a cross seal. His doubles appeared and rushed towards Aoi as we regrouped.</p><p>"Someone needs to go after Idate," I murmured.</p><p>The boys cut a glance around the area, as though suddenly realising that he wasn't here.</p><p>"Naruto," Sasuke suggested. "Leave a clone to watch the fight, so it can warn you if he gets past us."</p><p>"I-" Naruto protested.</p><p>"Protecting Idate is the mission," I reminded him. "We don't know if there are any more ninja…"</p><p>I was thinking <em> not</em> but it was always possibly.</p><p>Naruto saw the logic. "Fine," he said. "But you guys better hurry up. I'm not going to wait around for you forever, you know."</p><p>Then he was gone, a blur of orange scrambling up the cliff face. The clones around Aoi were being snuffed out surprisingly quickly.</p><p>"Pathetic," Aoi sneered as the last of them vanished. "No one on earth is a match for the Sword of the Thunder God. It's a blade that can cut <em> anything.</em> It even cuts through chakra. That technique stands no chance."</p><p>Sasuke's eyes narrowed at him.</p><p><em> Maybe,</em> I considered, <em> it would have been best to send Sasuke off and keep Naruto here.</em></p><p>"Now do you understand?" He gloated. "How pathetically out classed you are?"</p><p>"You know," I said. "For someone who keeps talking about how great you are, you seem pretty keen on making us give up so you don't have to fight us. What's the matter, scared we'll win?"</p><p>The sword hummed as it cut through the space between us. I ducked out of the way, but Sasuke blocked the attack with his kunai, the way I had at first.</p><p><em> Should have warned him about that,</em> I noted with a cringe.</p><p>"I see the stories are true," Aoi said as he threw Sasuke back. "I always heard the last of the Uchiha Clan was a hopeless loser unworthy of the name."</p><p><em> Uh-oh.</em></p><p>Sasuke's face was set with anger, and the Chidori blossomed in his hand so fast I didn't even see the hand seals. It clashed noisily with the sword, and both fighters strained against each other. For a second I thought it might work, then he was thrown backwards, lightning sparking over him.</p><p>My hands raced through seals. This jutsu wasn't one that I mastered, but I didn't need it to be.</p><p>"Hiding in the Mist Jutsu," I murmured, voice low.</p><p>There was so much water around, salt spray in the air, that even I could gather it together. I didn't need to make it thick, to limit visibility; that wasn't what I wanted it for.</p><p>"Sasuke!" I called, concentrating on gathering it carefully. "Don't just leap straight at him, that's never going to work! You've got to keep your distance!"</p><p>He glanced at me, sidelong, but some of the <em> rage</em> faded and he nodded curtly. He pulled out his fuuma shuriken and retreated a little.</p><p>I sighed with relief, glad that he'd listened.</p><p>"How touching," Aoi spat. "Defending each other, looking out for each other. Pathetic nonsense. Only a weakling needs to depend on others. Trusting other people to give you the strength you haven't got for yourself…"</p><p>Sasuke leapt up and <em> hurled</em> the fuuma shuriken down. From this angle, I could see the second one hidden in it's shadow, and the long looping strand of ninja wire between them.</p><p>Aoi sneered and batted them away.</p><p>I concentrated the mist, dragging it in close around him, until it became thick and visible.</p><p>The Sword of the Thunder God, concentrated lightning chakra, came into contact with the metal of the shuriken, sending electricity thrumming through it. It would have ended there, except for the mist.</p><p>In the Preliminaries, Naruto had already shown that wire and water worked wonders in enhancing the effect of lightning jutsu. This was a much smaller scale affair, but the principles were the same.</p><p>Aoi screamed as the feedback from his sword hit him.</p><p>"Looks like teamwork wins," I said, laconically, as he hit the ground with a thud. I let the mist disperse, soaking the ground with water. Aoi was twitching, half tangled in the wire, and the deactivated sword had rolled from his grasp.</p><p>I used my shadow to paralyse him, just in case he was faking, and eyed Sasuke. "Tie him up?"</p><p>The question then, of course, was what to do with him. He was, technically, a Konoha missing-nin, so by rights we <em> could</em> take him back to the village as a prisoner. Transporting him would be a pain, though, and technically he was <em> also</em> a Rain ninja so we might not be supposed to take him prisoner.</p><p><em> Pein. Akatsuki. Rain.</em> My mind reminded me, helpfully.</p><p>Sasuke finished tying him up, and he hadn't been exactly gentle about it. "What now?" he asked.</p><p>I pursed my lips. "Eh, where's the Shadow Clone?"</p><p>"Here!" One of the rocks transformed back into Naruto. "Want me to let the boss know you're done?"</p><p>"In a sec," I said. "I think you'll need to stay here and watch the prisoner. We should probably try and take him back with us."</p><p>I handed him a few knockout tags, because keeping him unconscious would minimise aggravation for all involved, and scooped up the <em> Lightsaber.</em></p><p>The Naruto clone made a clone, which dispersed, and waited for a bit, before obviously getting a reply. "Boss is at the bridge," he informed us.</p><p>Sasuke grunted. "Let's go."</p><p><hr /></p><p>We caught up to Naruto and Idate on the final leg of the race, and had passed Fukusuke sometime before that. Baring any last minute surprises, we were home free.</p><p>"I can't believe you won," Idate said.</p><p>Sasuke grunted.</p><p>I shrugged. "He was arrogant and insulting, but I don't think he was all that strong. He made you want to give up, and when that didn't work…"</p><p>Idate blinked. "Yeah," he said quietly. "I always… I always gave up."</p><p>Naruto scoffed. "I told you. As long as there's one person that believes in you, that's enough."</p><p>"And if you have friends that trust you, that's even better," I said, recalling Aoi's ranting. God knows what having him as a teacher would have been like.</p><p>The road up to the shrine itself was surrounded by crowd. The sheer volume of the cheering when Idate rounded the corner was almost deafening.</p><p>We kept our eyes open, but there were no last minute attacks and Idate crossed the finish line with the white ribbon fluttering gracefully through the air.</p><p>"And the winner is Idate Morino of the Wasabi Family!" The race official shouted.</p><p>People swarmed forward to congratulate him. Idate looked overwhelmed at the attention.</p><p>I smiled, a little bemused. "You know, this is the third time we've participated in a regime change."</p><p>The festival lasted pretty much all day, and when we headed down to the docks for the ferry to take us back to Port Degarashi, we ran into a bit of a surprise.</p><p>Pulling up at the harbour was a boat flying the Konoha flag. And on the boat…</p><p>"Hey, isn't that Ibiki?" Naruto asked, squinting.</p><p>It was. And wasn't that suspicious timing. Or maybe not 'suspicious'. Given that the race was a regular event, Ibiki had probably known about it and who was running in it long before we'd been sent. Maybe he'd meant to have it assigned to someone trustworthy and had been pre-empted by the situation or something and was now cleaning up.</p><p>"My team and I are returning to Konoha after our mission," Ibiki explained. "And were notified that there was a team here that would also need to return."</p><p>I didn't really want to know what kind of missions the head of Torture and Interrogation went on.</p><p>"That's us!" Naruto said, scratching the back of his head.</p><p>"Yes," I said. "There's something else though…" I hesitated then shrugged. "We ran into a Konoha missing-nin. He's currently tied up near the top of Nagi Island."</p><p>Ibiki raised an eyebrow. "Then we'll stop there and pick him up," he said calmly.</p><p>Idate seemed to shake himself out of his stupor. "Big brother?" he said timidly.</p><p>"Who are you?" Ibiki said, voice flat and turning to look at him. "Only one person called me that, and he died three years ago."</p><p><em> Can't be a missing-nin if you're 'dead'</em> , I thought.</p><p>They seemed to communicate with a look though, and Idate smiled and backed down. Well, at least he got something out of this.</p><p>We settled onto the boat, and it set off, almost hugging the coast so we could retrieve Aoi.</p><p>"To save time, I can take your mission reports now," Ibiki said.</p><p>One of my eyebrows tried to rise. Yeah, <em> that</em> wasn't standard practice at all. But if Ibiki was trying to keep Idate safe and out of the reports then it made sense. He did outrank us, and technically, by asking about Aoi, you could say we had consulted him and passed over leadership…</p><p>I shrugged. "Alright." It was probably arbitrary to let Idate go, while hauling Aoi in for questioning. But Idate had been a kid taken advantage of, while Aoi was a full grown jerk who should have known better.</p><p>Ibiki's response on seeing just <em> who</em> the missing nin was, was a little disturbing. "Aoi Rokusho," Ibiki said slowly, then grinned. It was not a <em> nice</em> smile. "I'll show you how interrogation is really done."</p><p><em> Right.</em></p><p>"You know," I said, frowning. "When we were fighting, he said something weird…"</p><p>"Yes?" Ibiki said, patiently. It was strange, for such an intimidating looking man, he could project an aura of calm and trustworthiness.</p><p>"About Hidden Rain," I said. "He said 'no one follows Hanzo anymore'. I just thought it was weird; I haven't heard of them changing leaders or anything."</p><p>A slight widening of his eyes was the only clue that that <em> hadn't</em> been the kind of question that he was expecting.</p><p>"Hidden Rain has always had a fair amount of infighting," he said carefully. "But I'm not aware of any leadership changes either."</p><p>I hummed, tipping my head back and staring at the sky.</p><p><em> Maybe</em> …</p><p><hr /></p><p>Urgh. This chapter just didn't want to get written. I couldn't pin any personality on Aoi other than 'giant asshole' and then tyring to work the back story in… and the Hidden Rain stuff. The timeline is <em> frustrating.</em> I have no idea when Pein took over and killed Hanzo, though it was kinda implied to have been a fair while before Jiraiya investigated. And even the two Genin knew at least the name Akatsuki…</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sound Four Arc: Chapter 57</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: You know, it kind of seems like I've started a craze here, with the SI's. XD Little Acorn by Colours of Iris, Konoha's Beautiful Lotus by Supernatural Crossover Girl, Hacia el sol by lucife56 … and more, I'm sure.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 57</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little, and it will fail to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while the Company is true. ~ Galadriel; Lord of the Rings</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Sasuke didn't show up to dinner. We'd made it a tradition, after completing a mission to have dinner at my place. And he didn't show up.</p><p>A cold hand gripped my heart. I knew, I <em> knew</em> it was coming soon, but it couldn't be <em> now, </em> could it? We'd only just got back this morning. I was going to train with him tomorrow, see if I could…</p><p>My mind was tossing and turning. Sasuke wouldn't leave, would he? He wasn't the same as canon Sasuke. He didn't… he wouldn't…</p><p>"We should go and look for him," I said, sounding distant even to myself. "Naruto?"</p><p>"He probably just got caught up training," Shikamaru said. "You shouldn't worry." He was picking up on my feelings, I knew he was, but he couldn't know <em> why</em> I was so worried. It probably looked like I was over reacting, but I couldn't help it.</p><p>"Sheesh, he's turning into Sensei, being late for dinner," Naruto complained. "Let's go drag him here. One really late person on the team is enough."</p><p>I could just imagine how annoyed Sasuke would be at that comparison and a ghostly smile traced my lips. It wasn't enough, though, to shake my feelings.</p><p>There were so many big events that I hadn't been able to touch, hadn't been able to affect at all. This was one that <em> was</em> small enough, personal enough, that I could … that I <em> should</em> have been able to alter. Should have been able to <em> change.</em></p><p>"Want me to come too?" Shikamaru offered with half lidded eyes. The fact that he was even <em> offering</em> to do something…</p><p>I nodded. "Mum will be here in case he shows up…" I said thoughtfully. If I treated it like a mission, search and rescue… "We'll check his apartment… team training grounds… the training grounds by the Naka River…"</p><p>Those were the most likely places that he would be. If he was still here at all.</p><p><em> If-</em></p><p>"Alright," Shikamaru said calmly. "I'll take the apartment. We'll meet up by the library once we're done."</p><p>I nodded. It didn't matter if Shika thought I was making a big deal out of nothing, at least he was taking it seriously. "I'll go to the Uchiha grounds," I volunteered.</p><p>The Naka river wound through the entirety of the old Uchiha district. The place was creepy, especially this late at night. It was just dead; a ghost town. There were a lot of training grounds though, the Uchiha had been a serious ninja clan. Sasuke still used them sometimes, when he didn't want to be disturbed.</p><p>"Sasuke?" I called timidly, feeling anxious. What if I was right? What if I was <em> wrong?</em> Hadn't there been Sound ninja involved? What if they were still here? But they couldn't get <em> in</em> to Konoha, could they?</p><p>I spread my chakra sense as wide as I could, slowly moving through the empty grounds and…</p><p><em> There.</em></p><p>One person. I locked onto the position and made a beeline for it. I doubted anyone but Sasuke would come here.</p><p>It <em> was</em> Sasuke. He wasn't training though. He was sitting slumped against the base of a tree, idly toying with a kunai.</p><p>"Sasuke," I said, half in greeting, half in relief. It faded a little, when I looked closer at him. He was battered. It was possible that it had come from training, of course…</p><p>He looked up. "Shikako? What are you doing here?"</p><p>"You missed dinner," I explained. "We were worried."</p><p>"Oh." He looked around, then ran a hand through his hair. "It's later than I thought, I guess. Sorry."</p><p>"What happened?" I asked. "You're hurt." I suspected I knew. I <em> hoped</em> I was wrong.</p><p>He looked away. "It's nothing."</p><p>"It's <em> not </em> nothing!" I said, voice uncharacteristically sharp. I took a deep breath and tried to tamp down on my fear and anxiety as Sasuke stared at me with wide eyes. "Please, Sasuke. Tell me what happened."</p><p>He paused. Looked away. For a second, I thought he wasn't going to say anything. But then he spoke. "There were these ninja… They said. They said they were from Orochimaru. They called themselves the Sound Four."</p><p>My mouth went dry. "Here?" I croaked. "In the village?" Not just <em> waiting</em> for him. Not just outside and ready if he left, but <em> here. </em></p><p>Sasuke nodded. "They wanted me to go with them," he confessed quietly.</p><p>"You didn't," I said. "You didn't go with them."</p><p>His hand reached up and curled over the mark on his neck. His eyes were very, very dark.</p><p><em> Don't you </em> dare,<em> Sasuke…</em></p><p>"'If you remain in this village,'" he quoted. "'You will never become strong. Every day, you're slowly decaying. Spend enough time here, and you'll forget all about Uchiha Itachi. Orochimaru will give you power.'"</p><p>"They're wrong," I said. "You won't forget about him. We're the <em> reason</em> you want to kill Itachi. You think… you think I don't want him dead too? You think I don't want to stop <em> dreaming</em> about-" I cut myself off. My voice was rising, sharp and tight and I could hear the ruined rasp beneath the tone. This wasn't the time for that. It was <em> never</em> the time for that. "<em> Orochimaru</em> came from Konoha. That's what made <em> him</em> strong. <em> Itachi</em> became strong here. Jiraiya. Tsunade. <em> Sensei.</em> "</p><p><em> Listen to me, Sasuke!</em></p><p>I couldn't tell what he was thinking. I couldn't tell if he was even listening.</p><p>"He can't offer you anything, Sasuke. And he wouldn't, even if he could. The only person that Orochimaru looks out for is Orochimaru. Everyone else is a tool."</p><p>"I know," he admitted softly. "They said the curse seal was killing me."</p><p><em> Carrot and the stick. You'll die if you don't come.</em> They had to have some kind of cure, or antidote.</p><p>"You don't use it though," I said. He was talking. That had to be a good sign. "And Tsunade is the best medic-nin in the world. If anyone…"</p><p>I trailed off. I wished there was something I could <em> say</em> . I wished I was more eloquent, had better arguments, was a better speaker.</p><p>Because… if Sasuke tried to leave now… I'd fight him.</p><p>I didn't want it to come to that.</p><p>"You are strong," I said softly. "Look at what we've done since we became Genin. How many A-ranks have we done? How many battles have we fought? How much have you learnt? Sharingan, Chidori… you<em> are</em> growing stronger. <em> We </em> are growing stronger."</p><p>He stared at me for a long while, then smirked tiredly. "Yeah, I guess you're right."</p><p>I scoffed weakly. "You guess."</p><p>Was that <em> it</em> ? Was that <em> enough?</em> Had I convinced him? Had he convinced himself?</p><p>"What should we do?" He asked.</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. <em> He's staying. He's going to stay. </em> "We need to go and see the Hokage."</p><p><hr /></p><p>We met up with the others at the library then headed to the Hokage's Tower. It wouldn't have been as easy to get in to see her if it hadn't been quite so late. Or if we hadn't had Naruto with us, because he just didn't take 'no' for an answer.</p><p>Considering we hadn't explained anything, and he was there solely on faith…</p><p>"What is it, brat?" Tsunade-sama barked. "Do you know what time it is? I'm supposed to be out of the office by now."</p><p>"Sasuke has something to say," Naruto responded, shrugging off her annoyed greeting.</p><p>Her golden eyes focused on Sasuke, taking in his slightly battered appearance.</p><p>"Orochimaru has ninja in Konoha," Sasuke said bluntly.</p><p>She sharpened to attention. "Details."</p><p>Security was currently tight and Tsunade had done a lot of work to remove any of Orochimaru's plants in Konoha, I thought, biting my lip. Either she'd missed one… or it was something more than a simple spy.</p><p><em> Is there a traitor in Konoha?</em></p><p>The answer was immediate.</p><p><em> Danzo.</em></p><p>But whatever his dealings, and I knew he had them with Orochimaru… it didn't make sense for him to let Sasuke out of the village. His driving force was to make the village as strong as possible and Sasuke was the last of the Uchiha…</p><p>He'd been involved in the whole Uchiha Massacre thing, though, and that was a <em> clusterfuck</em> and a half.</p><p>Something niggled in the back of my mind. Danzo. The Uchiha Massacre. The Sharingan? No, he already had many of them, didn't he? Had he given some to Orochimaru then? The implantation had been his work, hadn't it? But that wasn't… that wasn't what bothered me…</p><p>What was it then?</p><p>Danzo. Uchiha. Itachi.</p><p><em> Itachi</em> .</p><p>My eyes turned to Sasuke, almost automatically. Itachi had left Sasuke alive despite everything. Had <em> kept</em> him alive from whatever clean up procedures could have happened. Had come back to Konoha to remind them of that.</p><p>Itachi was dangerous. There was no doubt about that.</p><p>If Orochimaru just <em> happened</em> to take Sasuke… just <em> happened</em> to do whatever… well, that wasn't anything that could be Konoha's fault, was it?</p><p>It was a chilling thought. Pure supposition, though. Sheer guesswork.</p><p>It was good timing, too, with the mess at the border. All the high level ninja occupied either there or on missions…</p><p>Or was it?</p><p><em> You can't think everything is part of a conspiracy.</em> He had managed to stir Sand into attacking us, but that didn't mean Orochimaru was behind every skirmish that happened. Even though it provided an excellent opening for the Sound Four…</p><p>And the attack on Waterfall…</p><p><em> That way lies paranoia. </em> I scolded myself.</p><p>"At approximately 1700 hours, I encountered four shinobi in Training Ground Eighty Five," Sasuke said formally. This was a briefing now, not a conversation. "They identified themselves as the Sound Four; Tayuya, Kidomaru, Sakon and Jiroubou. They knew who I was and appeared to be looking for me." He shifted a little, uncomfortable. "Their goal appeared to be to convince me to leave Konoha and return to Hidden Sound with them. They were skilled fighters and at least one of them had a curse seal."</p><p>So they had fought. But four against one…</p><p>"They left?" Tsunade asked.</p><p>Sasuke shrugged. "They didn't seem to want to take me by force. They could have," he admitted, though it was grudging.</p><p>"You think they're waiting for you outside?" She asked, steepling her fingers.</p><p>This can't have been easy for Sasuke, admitting that they thought he would defect. It wasn't a good look. Bad enough to have someone else cast doubts on your loyalty, but worse to have to do it yourself.</p><p>He shrugged. "That was the implication."</p><p>"How long?" Tsunade asked. I could almost see her mind whirling. "How long did they give you to decide?"</p><p>Sasuke looked a little startled. "I… they didn't say. But they didn't seem like patient people."</p><p>Tsunade nodded, scribbling something on a piece of paper then jabbing a finger at Naruto. "You. Go to this address. Find Ibiki. Tell him to be here ASAP." She turned to us. "You two, put together a list of available Genin for a combat capture and retrieval mission." She turned to Sasuke. "And you, will tell me <em> everything.</em> "</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sound Four Arc: Chapter 58</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: Valerie - I didn't really intend to break for that long between chapters, honestly, which is half the reason that it was so short. I figured putting something up was better than nothing for another week. But I think this might be the only fic on the internet where an update in two weeks is considered <em> slow.</em> :P</p><p>Nemesis Jedi - as one of my other reviewers put it 'Danzo, in his efforts to make Konoha a better, safer place, basically manufactured every major threat ever encountered in the series proper.'</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 58</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Three things never trust in:</em></p><p><em> The maiden sworn as pure;</em></p><p><em> The vows a king has given;</em></p><p><em> And the ambush that is sure ~ Threes; Mercedes Lackey</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>It was fairly amazing how fast a mission could be put together when there was no other choice. We put together a list, had it approved by the Hokage and then darted all over Konoha <em> finding</em> those people, while stopping home to grab our gear and deliver a half-garbled explanation to a worried mum.</p><p>Shino was, most unfortunately, on a mission with his father and Lee was still in the hospital. That left Team 10, Team 7, Kiba and Neji. We'd considered both Tenten and Hinata, but neither were that extraordinary, and taking an unsealed Byakugan up against Orochimaru's people might have been just asking for trouble. He hadn't expressed any interest in it, but his minions could probably come up with a clever idea like that on their own.</p><p>"This is a classified A-rank mission," Ibiki started, once we were all together in one of the briefing rooms. "In better circumstances, this mission team would be compromised of Jounin and high level Chunin. However, by necessity, you are here." His eyes swept over us. "In order for this mission to succeed, you will need to commit <em> fully.</em> There can be no hesitation. If you have doubts, this is the <em> only</em> chance you will get to withdraw."</p><p>Kiba smirked. "I think you've asked us this question before. Same answer. We're in."</p><p><em> Cocky bastard,</em> I thought, mildly irritated. He really had no idea what we were about to come up against. But I didn't think any of them would have pulled out, regardless. There was a <em> reason</em> Ibiki had made that the final question.</p><p>"Damn right we are," Naruto agreed loudly. "So what are we doing?"</p><p>Ibiki had a great poker face, but the lift of his lips was definitely amused. "This afternoon, four shinobi from Hidden Sound made contact with Sasuke Uchiha, with the express purpose of taking him to Orochimaru. These four are known to be high ranking members of his organisation, and would therefore possess highly sensitive information. Our mission is to capture them and return them to Konoha for interrogation."</p><p>There was momentary silence as they absorbed this.</p><p>"They came to get Sasuke?" Chouji asked.</p><p>"Indeed." Ibiki nodded. "That fact is crucial to our plan."</p><p>"You're going to use him as bait," Ino said, eyes darting to Sasuke. "Is that safe?" It wasn't really a surprise that Ino had picked up on it, or that she was the one to worry about it. Information gathering was where the Yamanaka speciality came in handy, and sometimes that meant dangling bait.</p><p>I couldn't say I <em> really</em> liked the idea, either, considering we were basically going to hand them exactly what they wanted then hope that we could take it back. Still, the Sound Four would probably have a fair amount of insight into where Orochimaru was, what he was up to and so forth. Failing that, it would also be possible to study their curse marks, which might help with Sasuke.</p><p>"There are many missions you will be asked to complete that are not 'safe'," Ibiki said. "This is one of them. However, we will take all possible precautions to ensure nothing happens to him."</p><p>Sasuke looked mostly indifferent to this statement, but his arms were folded a tad too tightly across his chest to be completely casual.</p><p>Ibiki proceeded to lay out the plan and a surprising amount of information about the four, some of which had to have come from Sasuke's brief encounter. Aside from their basic body types - Sakon's two heads and Kidomaru's six arms merited more than one mention - and a brief taijutsu encounter, Kidomaru had utilised his webs and at least one of them had revealed a curse mark with the implication that the others had them too. It was certainly better than <em> no</em> information.</p><p>We would leave Konoha at about two in the morning, travelling north to hopefully get ahead of the Sound Four. Unfortunately for us, there were no chokepoints or pathways that they <em> had</em> to take, so we needed to spread out to cover all possible paths of travel.</p><p>Sasuke would slip out of the village at four, the time of night when people were least alert. Given that there had been no directed meeting place, he'd head north in an attempt to find the Sound Four. That was one of the weaker parts of the plan. We couldn't just look for them and attack, because if they were camping out close to Konoha, then they'd have the entire area around them trapped and would notice us coming a mile out. If we could even find them in the first place. The fact that the patrols and guards hadn't spotted them didn't look good for us. That was why we actually had to risk sending Sasuke out to them.</p><p>Sasuke would be wearing an Intelligence Division hidden radio transmitter, that was similar but different to the radios we sometimes used. For one, it was one way, and would only send <em> from</em> Sasuke to us. For another, it had a sensitive microphone and could pick up nearby conversations. Once he met up with them, Sasuke would attempt to get a verbal confirmation of their direction, and if that failed, Ibiki had placed a tracking seal on him.</p><p>We'd then move to intercept, and ambush them just after dawn, giving us light to work with.</p><p>"With four of them and eight of us," Ibiki continued. "It would be best for us to work in pairs, rather than squads. If the ambush fails, the first priority will be in separating them and taking them down individually. Orochimaru maintains enough Konoha teachings to structure teams so that each member covers the weaknesses of the rest. The full squad was able to compete with ANBU as they left Konoha during the invasion. All attempts will be made to prevent you from having to face them, but <em> be aware</em> that they are dangerous."</p><p>Establishing team pairs would be awkward. We had more close combat fighters than ranged. Added to that… "Chouji and Ino need to be teamed with Shikamaru and I for best effect," I said, thinking out loud. "Chouji with Shikamaru, and Ino with me, probably, since I have more close quarters abilities. Neji's Byakugan is probably most useful to the team leader, but that leaves Naruto and Kiba…" Who were both too hot headed. Naruto was <em> better</em> but he was still rash. Additionally, they were both close fighters, but had <em> some</em> range with Naruto's Shadow Clones and Kiba's Tunnelling Fang. "So Naruto and Neji together… and that'd leave Kiba with Ibiki." Which put Kiba with the strongest, most experienced person, since he was arguably weaker than the other two. And his ability to track made him just as valuable as Neji.</p><p>I blinked, noticing everyone staring at me. "Or whatever you suggest," I added, sinking low in my chair.</p><p>His lips quirked. "Valid suggestions," he noted. "Second in command will be Shikamaru Nara -" He ignored my brother's muttered 'troublesome' "- and the teams will be as follows. Team one, myself and Kiba Inuzuka. Team two, Shikamaru Nara and Chouji Akimichi. Team three, Shikako Nara and Ino Yamanaka. Team four, Neji Hyuuga and Naruto Uzumaki."</p><p>I wasn't sure whether he'd listened to me, or whether he'd already decided on the same teams. It wasn't, really, that hard of a conclusion to come to.</p><p>"For now, I suggest you prepare and rest."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"<em> So this is where you are, right on top of the Hokage Mountain. I'm surprised you got so close to the village."</em></p><p>"<em> Hmph. Your pathetic little village has miserable security."</em></p><p>"<em> We would teach them a lesson, but that's not why we're here. Orochimaru-sama is waiting for you."</em></p><p>"<em> I see. So how are we going? Straight north, or do you plan on evasion trails?"</em></p><p>I held my breath as Sasuke's voice crackled over my earpiece, exchanging looks with Ino. We were all staggered through the forest, and our next move would depend on their answer. Hopefully it would be a place that all four teams could get to in time.</p><p>"<em> There's no need to lay false trails. Hidden Leaf is so weak they couldn't send a pursuit squad even if they wanted to."</em></p><p><em> Not a pursuit squad, </em> I thought, <em> but your arrogance will be your undoing.</em></p><p>I hoped.</p><p>"<em> All teams move to position three,"</em> Ibiki's voice crackled over the radio. <em> "Repeat. All teams to position three."</em></p><p>"<em> Team two copies."</em></p><p>"Team three, acknowledged," I added.</p><p>"<em> Uh, yeah, this is team four. We're on it."</em></p><p>"Let's go," I said to Ino, hopping down off the perch where I'd spent that last half an hour or so. I took a second to reorient myself and headed off.</p><p>"Right," Ino said, exhaling. She looked a little nervous, but not too nervous. I didn't blame her, I was feeling a little jittery myself.</p><p>We were supposed to keep comm. chatter to a minimum, which was pretty standard practice, and Sasuke's line was mostly silent. I was a little surprised that they'd asked him no questions at all, but I guess that was another mark of their arrogance. They assumed he was with them willingly, that even if he'd been spotted leaving there weren't enough forces in Konoha to challenge them.</p><p>"Do you think it'll be alright?" Ino asked.</p><p>I contemplated a variety of responses including 'no', 'probably not', and 'it's unlikely', but discarded them as being ultimately unhelpful and thoroughly pessimistic. "It'll be tricky," I said. "But if we give it our best, we'll pull through."</p><p>Better planned, better prepared, better outfitted… we had more people and more information… We even had an actual Special Jounin with us.</p><p>And given what his speciality was, I was willing to be he knew dozens of ways of detaining people for transport. It was harder to stop someone without killing them, yes, but even if we only got <em> one</em> of them it would still be worthwhile.</p><p>We were almost at the regrouping point when one of the Sound ninja spoke again.</p><p>"<em> Let's stop here for a second."</em></p><p>"<em> We're barely away from the village,"</em> Sasuke's incredulous voice came over the radio. He was actually holding up pretty well; this had to be nerve wracking for him.</p><p>"<em> This won't take long. Before we go any further, you need to die."</em></p><p>For a second, I didn't even comprehend the words. The sounds were there, but the <em> meaning…</em></p><p>"<em> What?" </em> Naruto shouted through the comm.</p><p>"<em> Hold your course,"</em> Ibiki said, voice calm. "<em> Continue on to position three."</em></p><p>"<em> Are you kidding? We have to get to him!"</em></p><p>Ino cast me a worried look. I knew, without a seconds doubt, that if I ignored Ibiki and went after Sasuke she would follow me.</p><p>My mind started racing over the possibilities. Sasuke was no use to them dead, no use at all. Orochimaru wanted to use him as a body, and for that he needed to be alive. I thumbed the switch on my radio. "Naruto. Listen to Ibiki. It could be a feint to draw out observers. They're not going to kill him."</p><p>My palms were surprisingly damp. I really hoped I was right. But Sasuke had code words and he knew enough to <em> run </em> if things looked bad<em> .</em></p><p>"<em> Stop being so dramatic, Sakon,"</em> an irritated female voice said. Tayuya, then, the only female of the group. "<em> It's like we said before, that curse mark you have is only in the first state. It's consuming you. Progressing the mark to Level 2 will help stabilise it and increase its strength. Who knows, you might even be as strong as us."</em> There was a faint, mocking lit to the words.</p><p>"<em> The problem is, strengthening the curse mark also increases its effects on the body. Such a rapid change would kill you. So instead, we will suspend you in a state of half death, while you adapt to the change."</em></p><p>"<em> And I'm just supposed to </em> trust<em> that this 'half death' doesn't end up being the real thing?" </em></p><p>"<em> Don't forget who we are; Orochimaru's hand picked bodyguards. If there's anybody that knows about barrier ninjutsu, curse marks and all the rest, it'd be us."</em></p><p>That wasn't really the question that Sasuke had been asking, but it was an answer in its own right. They were good enough to prevent an accidental death, and didn't want to risk Orochimaru's wrath with a purposeful one.</p><p>"<em> And you want to do this </em> now<em> ?"</em> Sasuke asked dubiously. There was no real win for him here - the curse mark was bad and, even if they used words like 'stabilise', strengthening it couldn't be good and he'd also be completely out of it for the rest of the trip. But there was very little chance to <em> refuse.</em> That was the danger of undercover assignments; you had to play the role.</p><p>"<em> You're no use to Orochimaru-sama as weak as you are. If we start now, the process should be over by the time we return."</em></p><p>"<em> And if there's fighting?"</em></p><p>"<em> There's no one that can get past us. Just take the pill already!"</em></p><p>I was so focused on listening to the conversation, that I nearly overshot the meeting point. A quick application of chakra helped slow me down, but it was a less than graceful landing.</p><p>Team one was already there, having had the central point so they could move in any direction, and team two wasn't far away.</p><p>"<em> Four Black Fog Formation!"</em></p><p>"Sasuke Uchiha is currently incapacitated," Ibiki said once we were all there. His face was serious but he didn't look overly worried. "He will not be able to participate in, or escape from, the ambush. Therefore, when teams two and three are trapping the enemy, team four will be removing Sasuke from the group to stop him from being caught in the crossfire."</p><p>Naruto and Neji nodded. Naruto didn't look too happy about the way things were going - clenching and unclenching his fists - but he wasn't saying anything and he hadn't broke cover to go attack.</p><p>I wasn't exactly too happy with having Sasuke in their grasp either, but I'd much prefer to have as many advantages as possible when we did fight.</p><p>It didn't take long - we weren't that far ahead - but it felt like it. Apprehension was a killer, drawing the seconds out as we stayed tense and alert.</p><p>I could feel the chakra signals moving, and Neji gave the alert when he spotted them coming with his Byakugan. We all adjusted our positions and exchanged nervous glances.</p><p><em> This is it.</em> It was hardly the first fight I'd been in, and not even the most dangerous <em> really. </em> That didn't mean I wasn't edgy.</p><p>"Wait!" Kidomaru said, sounding weirdly doubled as I heard it through both the radio and air. The group was close, not quite in the middle of our formation but nearly. "There's something-"</p><p>Ibiki dropped his hand. That was the signal.</p><p>Kiba and Akamaru spun into action, leaping out of the treetops. "Fang Over Fang!" They didn't head straight for the group and attempt to hit them, for fear of hitting Sasuke, but the high speed drills careenered around the ground, circling them randomly and carefully keeping them together in a group.</p><p>At the height of his third arc, he threw down a smoke bomb that billowed thick purple smoke everywhere, completely covering the four shinobi.</p><p>"That's not going to help you, trash!" Tayuya shouted.</p><p>Shikamaru and I dropped down to the ground on opposite sides of the group. Funnily enough, smoke in no way impedes our shadows. I made four connections, and felt Shikamaru do the same, the weird echo of chakra connecting me to him. Three of the possessions were solid, but the last…</p><p>It was tugging, pulling…</p><p>I'd felt that before, against Kisame. He was using the connection to drain the jutsu of chakra. It was much slower than the rapid consuming of Samehada, but still worrying. Against him, Shadow Possession would be weaker at best… and dangerous at worst.</p><p>I could feel the sudden blip of Naruto's chakra as he moved Sasuke out of the way. The smoke was already starting to clear, but it's job was done. Then Ibiki was there, hands slapping down on the ground, ink blooming out around them.</p><p>"Summoning; Torture Chamber!"</p><p>Usually, summons are creatures with whom you've signed a contract but it isn't impossible to summon other things. Inanimate objects. It isn't <em> storage</em> like sealing scrolls, and the objects usually have some special abilities or uses. Orochimaru's Rashamon Gates are a prime example. What they actually <em> are</em> , where they come from, how you get them… that's something I don't actually know. Maybe you have to make them, through seals, or building them then sealing them, or maybe they do exist <em> somewhere</em> and they are being called, just like creature summons. You can do practically <em> anything</em> with seals, so it wouldn't surprise me.</p><p>This technique was one of those.</p><p>The area around them blacked out, twisted into some self-contained chakra-space, as wires whipped out of nowhere and encircled the four prisoners. It pulled them harshly into a square, one on each wall, leaving Ibiki in the centre, and glowing with chakra, the walls of the cage unfolded and surrounded them.</p><p>It was fast and <em> impressive. </em> A complete prison out of nowhere. The thing was still there-but-not, in that black chakra-space, but I had no doubt that Ibiki could send it away and call it back once he was somewhere more… useful.</p><p>My eyes narrowed as I contemplated the scene. We had Sasuke. They were all caught. "Too easy," I said pessimistically.</p><p><em> It </em> couldn't <em> be so easy.</em></p><p>Regretfully, I was pretty much right. They started thrashing heavily in the chains. It didn't get them anywhere; the place looked like it was built to withstand that. But then the black smudges of the curse marks started spreading across their skin.</p><p>"You are going to regret this," Sakon snarled, yanking his arms. The wire was probably cutting into them good, but the pain just seemed to enrage them more than it deterred them.</p><p>Ibiki ran through a set of hand seals and started slowly sinking into the floor. I guessed that was his exit strategy.</p><p>The blotches spread right across their faces, blurring until there was more ink than skin.</p><p>Then they started to glow.</p><p>They mutated. The surge in chakra was sickening. It felt <em> polluted</em> , like smog or dirty water. But there was so <em> much</em> of it.</p><p>"What the <em> hell</em> is that?" Kiba yelped.</p><p>In Level 2 state, they looked formidable, and as much as their chakra had increased so had their strength and speed. Now, the thrashing about was actually <em> working. </em> The wires started snapping with a sound that echoed like a thunderclap through the clearing.</p><p>As Kidomaru pulled himself free of the wires, a flaw in Ibiki's jutsu became clear.</p><p>He was still in there with them.</p><p>Kidomaru lurched forward, fisting one hand in Ibiki's jacket and hauling him back inside. He spat web but Ibiki curled around the arm holding him, bracing himself on it and kicking out towards the curse mark bearers face.</p><p>"I can't <em> believe</em> we're forced to use this against trash like you," Sakon said derisively. Three of them attacked Ibiki, boxing him in and using the small space to their advantage, but I was more worried that Jiroubou <em> didn't.</em></p><p>I frowned, then realised what he was doing. "The big one is draining the chakra from the jutsu! He's going to make it collapse."</p><p>Shikamaru muttered something under his breath that might have been a curse. With Ibiki … occupied, he was in charge. His hands flexed and formed a circle.</p><p>"Naruto! Can you get Ibiki out of there?" I asked, the thought suddenly occurring to me. In the cage, Sakon landed a solid kick that threw Ibiki flat on the barred <em> ceiling</em> . The wires snapped out, clearly under his control and trying to catch the prisoners again, or at least prevent them from touching him.</p><p>Naruto's eyes widened, and he formed a hand seal. There was a seconds pause, and a burst of chakra smoke beside him, but nothing happened. "Not while that cage is there," he said, crestfallen.</p><p>It wasn't unexpected. The point of caging things was to make sure that they couldn't get out, after all.</p><p>"Whatever that transformation is, there's no doubt that it's made them stronger," Shikamaru said. "The fact that they've broken Ibiki's jutsu means that our chances of restraining them like this are incredibly low. That means our objective has changed. The most important thing now is to keep Sasuke away from them." His eyes were serious as he looked over us. "Kiba, you've got the best speed and stamina out of all of us. Take the barrel, and head back to Konoha. Sasuke is helpless and probably needs medical attention. Of course, if you can rustle up some back up, that'd be good too."</p><p>Kiba didn't exactly look too happy to be the one running off, but he couldn't exactly <em> argue</em> with that reasoning. I might have been faster, in the short term, and Naruto might have had more stamina, but Kiba had the best of both and was the undeniable best choice to carry something as bulky as the barrel.</p><p>"You got it," he said. "Just leave it to me. I'll be back before you know it." He moved Akamaru to the sentry position on his head, and awkwardly secured his arms around the barrel.</p><p>"That leaves us a team down," Shikamaru said, watching him go. "Naruto, Neji… are you alright to be split up?"</p><p>"Of course!" Naruto beamed even as Neji replied in the affirmative.</p><p>"Good. You two are our strongest solo fighters. We need to split them up, stall them and prevent them from going after Sasuke and Kiba. If it's possible to capture them, do it… but this is more than we expected. We need some way to scatter them. Shikako?"</p><p>"I can blow the clearing," I confirmed. "Once Naruto gets Ibiki out of the way."</p><p>I could set the seal right now, actually.</p><p>"Timer?" Shikamaru asked briskly.</p><p>"No. Manual activation." It was handier, sometimes, to be able to control what went off when. It got tricky when you had multiple seals about, but it was worth it.</p><p>"Alright. Naruto, flood the place with clones, and when the summoning drops, get Ibiki out of there. Shikako will blow them up and hopefully injure them and scatter them. The we separate. The big guy drains chakra, so our shadow techniques aren't going to work on him and probably not Naruto's clones either. That leaves him to Neji." He paused very briefly as though waiting for protest, but there was none. "Sakon seems to be close range, so he's yours Naruto. The web shooter isn't good for Chouji's manoeuvrability -"</p><p>"We've got him," I said quickly. Pinning Chouji down would limit him drastically, where as it wasn't nearly so bad a thought for Ino and I.</p><p>"Right. That leaves us with the unknown girl. Great."</p><p>The cage was starting to flicker now, becoming insubstantial as it lost chakra. It was almost impressive that it had lasted so long. Either that or his ability to drain chakra didn't work that <em> quickly</em> .</p><p>We leapt up into the trees, putting distance between us and them.</p><p>"Look at that, trash," Tayuya mocked. "Your comrades have abandoned you. Guess you weren't much of a leader."</p><p>We waited. Then the assembled Naruto clones sent up a battle cry, and Ibiki was suddenly among us, slung over Naruto's shoulder, bloody and injured.</p><p>I slammed my hands together in a seal and pulsed my chakra. "Explode!"</p><p>I hadn't skimped on the power and though the blast didn't reach us, the gust of wind it caused still plastered my bangs flat.</p><p>It wasn't enough to kill them, unfortunately, and I could still feel their chakra pulsing, though they had been thrown around by it.</p><p>Neji had his Byakugan active and rapidly gave us their new locations.</p><p>"Right. Let's go," Shikamaru said.</p><p>We moved out.</p><p><hr /></p><p>So, new FFNet layout. I've put one of lucife56's pictures as the image, but I think it gets chopped a bit. I will… work something out. Speaking of Fanart, Lollyst did some for me as well. Links in my profile as normal.</p><p>I did have a mission planning scene at the start, with all the 'who, what, where' but it just kept going over the same ground and was really boring, hence the fast forward. Hmm, what else? I did, in fact, have a lot I wanted to say, but when it comes time to write the notes I always forget. Terrible of me.</p><p>Hope everything makes sense, etc.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sound Four Arc: Chapter 59</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: I think I'm in the wrong fandom for this, but the fight scenes are killing me.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 59</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> As long as the world is turning and spinning, we're gonna be dizzy and we're gonna make mistakes. ― Mel Brooks</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The thing about combat was, once it was started it went <em> fast.</em> There was no time to stop and discuss strategies or tactics; any analysing had to be done on the run. We couldn't delay because our goal and theirs were completely different. <em> They</em> were after Sasuke, which meant that the instant they were back on their feet, they'd head after Kiba.</p><p>Given that they were in Level 2 of the curse mark, and the ridiculous jump in strength and speed that that gave them, it probably wouldn't take all that long to catch up, either.</p><p>Ino and I bounced from tree branch to tree branch, the forest blurring around us as we powered through. We weren't exactly being stealthy, but in this case stealth lost to speed.</p><p>I could hear the movement of the others as they did the same, which made sense because the Sound Four hadn't necessarily been separated far from each other, and any decent ninja would try and regroup. We'd have to do something about that, lead them off, separate them, if we didn't want to get stuck in a team vs team battle. We'd already seen how that went down.</p><p>"Ino," I said quietly. "This curse state… if it affects the mind as they seem to imply… what would that do to your jutsu?" Given that it was part of Orochimaru's possession jutsu, I was almost certain that nothing good could come of it.</p><p>She bit her lip. "Maybe nothing."</p><p><em> Maybe.</em></p><p>You couldn't quantify the mind, so determining what would and would not have an effect… it was all guesswork.</p><p>"That's… not good," I said. That was an understatement. I didn't <em> know</em> what would happen, but the danger…</p><p>"We can't just <em> not</em> use it because it <em> might</em> be dangerous," Ino said, like she knew exactly what I was thinking. "This is pretty much a textbook case. Nara, Yamanaka, single person non-lethal takedown. It's pretty much what the Mind-Body Switch was created for."</p><p>"Except if it puts you in danger," I pointed out.</p><p>"You don't know that it will," she refuted.</p><p>Know? No, I didn't. But the likelihood was pretty damn high.</p><p>"Tell me, with one hundred percent certainty that it won't hurt you," I said, knowing she couldn't.</p><p>"Tell me, with one hundred percent certainty, that you have a plan that will work without either of us getting injured," she shot back.</p><p><em> Snap.</em></p><p>I couldn't do that either.</p><p>"You can't ground me just because it <em> might</em> be dangerous," she said flatly. "You can't afford to. Not now."</p><p>She was right. Mind-Body Switch was her trump card.</p><p>There was no more time to argue anyway, as we passed out of the destruction zone and zeroed in on the chakra signal that was our target. With the way it felt, there was no way to miss it. Unwillingly, I shivered. If I'd thought that the curse seal had felt bad in the Forest when Sasuke had been given it, it was nothing compared to this. It was like pollution, like smog or filthy water, so strong you wondered how you could breathe in it.</p><p>Kidomaru didn't look injured, though maybe a little disorientated, and there was a golden substance flaking off his skin that gave a clue as to why. It reminded me a little of Gaara's sand armour, which was all the comparison I needed.</p><p><em> One day, my explosions are going to actually hurt someone and I will be </em> incredibly<em> surprised,</em> I thought, offhand.</p><p>"Che," he snorted. "That's what they send after me? This won't even be any fun. And here I was thinking I'd have time to play a game or two, but it's just not worth it when there's no challenge."</p><p>I'd have protested, maybe said something snarky, but this was going to be a hell of a fight on our end and I knew it.</p><p>Neji had almost died fighting Kidomaru, in canon, and despite how his fight with Naruto had gone, he was not a pushover.</p><p>He spat a wad of white, all six hands manipulating it with speed, and threw.</p><p>"<em> Spider Web Unrolling!"</em></p><p><em> Fast!</em> I thought, alarmed. The sticky thread funnelled out away from him, spreading wider and wider every second it travelled. There was no way we'd manage to escaped the net before it caught us.</p><p>I raced through the seals of the replacement jutsu, launching myself into the trees behind him. Ino didn't make it, ending up pinned to a tree trunk with limited mobility.</p><p><em> Arms free,</em> I noticed. <em> Enough to make a hand seal.</em></p><p>It wasn't ideal.</p><p>But I was too busy dodging the sudden barrage of double layered nets flying at me, ducking behind trees to put an obstacle in between us. I couldn't keep it up forever, though, because otherwise he'd turn on Ino. Which, no.</p><p>Even then, I did appreciate the complexity of his jutsu. The webs - sticky and strong - had threads of his chakra running through it, precise and well balanced. Given that they were completely separated from him, it was an extreme level of chakra control. Added to the speed and agility with which he produced them, there was no doubt that Kidomaru had earnt his place among Orochimaru's top echelon.</p><p>It was a fact that was easy to forget when you knew he'd been beaten by a Genin, but it was no less true for it.</p><p>"I already know how your jutsu works," Kidomaru said, circling. "Using your shadow to control the movements of your opponent. It's a clever trick, but easy to defeat. All I have to do is keep my distance."</p><p>"You would think, wouldn't you?" I said levelly. Given that he'd managed to survive - uninjured - the previous explosion, his armour could soak up a lot of damage, and he could probably activate it pretty damn quickly. So explosions weren't going to get me anywhere. Probably not projectiles either. The closer I got, the harder it would be to avoid his sticky webs, and six arms would give a crazy taijutsu bonus.</p><p>"One," he said. I caught the brief glint of light on metal and reflexively threw a kunai to intercept it. The <em> clang</em> that echoed was definitely the sound of metal on metal, but as they spun off track I noticed that the kunai he used was unusually coloured - gold like the armour that had protected him.</p><p>"Two," he said, and I crouched, deflecting both weapons and gritting my teeth. There was no point asking 'is this just a game to you?' because it was clear what the answer was. Yes.</p><p>That could be exploited. It was clear that he didn't even consider the fact that he could lose. The thing about games was that you played because they were fun, and you played until they weren't fun anymore. He wasn't going for the kill, not really, and that was something I could use.</p><p>"Four."</p><p><em> Doubles. </em> And they were coming from different angles. He wasn't moving though, so he must have been controlling the release with threads.</p><p>"Eight." At this speed and range, that was starting to get too many. I ducked and twisted and deflected, but one sliced a line of fire across my shin and another became lodged in the material of my jacket, pressing against my ribs but not penetrating. Thankfully.</p><p>Kidomaru laughed. "Not long now. <em> Sixteen</em> ," he said with relish.</p><p>I dropped my kunai. "Earth Release; Earth Style Wall." It grew out of the ground, curving around me slightly, and I pressed my back flat against it, rearming myself. The earth wall faced him, and I was out of sight for a brief time. It was now or never.</p><p>I pressed both hands against the wall. "Touch Blast," I murmured as quietly as possible.</p><p>Then I sank underground, barely hearing the count of "Thirty two."</p><p>I pushed myself through the ground, moving along barely under the surface. Speed, not depth was key here. Kidomaru hadn't moved yet, hadn't seemed to notice that I had gone. True or not, I couldn't pass up the chance and my hands burst the surface, grasping for his ankles.</p><p>He wrenched away with strength that jarred my wrists, pulling me <em> out</em> of the ground, and I stumbled awkwardly as the ground sank beneath my feet before I could cancel the jutsu.</p><p>"Not bad," he said, smirking. He'd measured the distance well, he was too far away for me to get without a boost to my shadow. He looked over his shoulder to see the wall that was perforated with gold kunai. "Block my sight, then escape to attack me from underground. Seems like shadows aren't the only trick you have after all."</p><p>"No," I agreed, just as the wall exploded.</p><p>Gold soaked across his skin almost instantly, shielding him from the damage that blew chunks of earth sky high and toppled the mighty tree behind it, but I hadn't done it to hurt him. Explosions, giant balls of fire, created light.</p><p>His shadow stretched towards me, even as mine stretched towards him.</p><p>"Un," I grunted as it connected, feeling like lead weights constricting my limbs. We struggled, grappling for control, chakra vs chakra.</p><p>I was only winning because I had experience.</p><p>I twisted my neck sideways, even as he spat a web from his mouth. It splattered harmlessly against the ground. He didn't need hand seals for it, and that made him dangerous even now.</p><p>His arms were twitching. It was hard for me to <em> not move</em> limbs that I didn't have. He was slowly, but surely, overcoming me.</p><p>"Ino! Now!" I shouted.</p><p>The dust of the explosion was settling. The tree that had toppled, ripped out of the ground, left a clean line of sight between the two of them. Ino might have still be stuck to the tree, all but forgotten, but she didn't need to move for this.</p><p>I felt her gather her chakra. "Mind-Body Switch Jutsu!" She cried.</p><p>I felt her chakra surge. I felt it travel. I felt it hit.</p><p>I felt the weakening in the resistance to my jutsu, and almost sagged in relief.</p><p>I didn't drop it, though. Not yet. Not until she gave confirmation.</p><p>The moment stretched. I felt my apprehension build.</p><p>"Ino?"</p><p>Kidomaru twitched.</p><p>"That," he said. "Wasn't very nice."</p><p>I swallowed, mouth suddenly dry.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Ino's body hanging limply in it's bindings. Her chakra was still halved, still <em> there</em> trying to possess him.</p><p><em> Bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea…</em></p><p>He jerked against my hold. His strugglers were weaker, less controlled, but still so strong. He was moving. I could see the gold pooling in his hands, shaping into kunai.</p><p>"Ino?" I repeated.</p><p>"Your friend is… having a tougher time that she expected," he said. His face twitched, grimacing.</p><p>He pushed against my hold. I pushed back, automatically, keeping him still. I could feel my chakra draining for every second I held the jutsu, but as long as Ino was in there I couldn't let go.</p><p>Because if she was in there… I couldn't attack him.</p><p><em> Shit, shit, shit, shit.</em></p><p>"Ino," I said clearly. "If it isn't working, abort the jutsu."</p><p>If she could hear me. If she even <em> could</em> cancel the jutsu.</p><p><em> Okay, new plan.</em> For a second, my mind was terrifyingly blank. I couldn't hurt him, not without hurting Ino. And I'd need to protect Ino's body, which was still pinned to the tree.</p><p>The kunai in his hands were ready. The extra sets of arms twitched and I felt the phantom pull on my back as I tried to stop them. The angle wasn't good, or the power of the throw. I tried to twist out of the way and <em> couldn't.</em></p><p><em> He's fighting against me,</em> I realised with alarm. <em> Powering opposite where I want to go.</em></p><p>One slammed into the muscle of my thigh, two into my chest - most of the momentum killed by the thick padding of my jacket and probably ruining the scroll that was tucked into my pocket - but the most dangerous one grazed my neck.</p><p>I felt blood trickling down my collar and swallowed heavily.</p><p>"This jutsu works both ways, doesn't it?" He asked, even as more gold pooled in his hands. "You can stop me moving… but I can stop <em> you</em> from moving."</p><p>He grinned, sharp and nasty. "Game over."</p><p>I eyed the kunai in his hands. My thigh trembled and the cut on my neck itched. He'd have better aim this time.</p><p>I cut the jutsu and dove to the side just as he released them. My hand pressed onto the ground and I murmured "Flashbang," before flipping to my feet. There was a momentary flare of pride at the speed and ease that I'd managed to place it while moving, but it was buried under the sheer urgency of the situation.</p><p>I cushioned chakra around my ears, blocking sound just as the seal went off behind me. Even so, I could <em> feel</em> the wave of sound rattling my bones, and the bright light seared through my eyelids.</p><p><em> Ram, snake, tiger. Illusionary Clone Jutsu!</em></p><p>My clone darted sideways, leaping through the trees as I hightailed it for Ino. Kidomaru was stumbling behind me, and once I dropped the chakra cushion I could hear him <em> cursing.</em></p><p><em> Go, go, go</em> , I chanted.</p><p>Ino was so still, barely breathing, but unharmed. I tried to slash the web with a kunai, but it didn't budge.</p><p><em> How did-? Jyuuken.</em> But I couldn't do that. And the time it would take for me to <em> try</em> that method would be too long. Kidomaru wouldn't be staggered for long, and it would be a poor ninja that was truly fooled by an illusionary clone.</p><p>Then I remembered and dug furiously into my jacket pocket for something I probably shouldn't have had with me. Ibiki had debriefed us on the boat, and I hadn't had to go into the Missions Office to hand in my report yet…</p><p><em> It can cut even chakra!</em> Aoi had boasted.</p><p>I pulled the cylinder out and activated the Sword of the Thunder God. Using an unknown weapon in combat was a dumb idea, especially if you weren't trained for it, and I'd mostly grabbed it on a whim because it was cool.</p><p>Carefully, I set the stable lightning blade against the webbing and nearly sighed in relief as it parted easily. I curved it around Ino, slicing as carefully as I could. It carved great gashes in the tree but she was free. I caught her awkwardly, cancelling the blade and stuffing it back in my pocket before slinging her over my shoulder and hightailing it.</p><p>I felt the <em> flare</em> of chakra, and dove to the side, just as the branch where I had been standing nearly <em> exploded. </em> There was a brief flash of gold, and the trail of destruction continued through the canopy.</p><p><em> Highly destructive projectile,</em> I analysed.</p><p>I zigzagged, pouring as much speed on as I could, trying to put as many obstacles between us as possible.</p><p>I sent off more clones, and most of them ended up dead fairly quickly, which was not reassuring. I didn't have the concentration to make them evade in complex ways, not while keeping <em> us</em> alive.</p><p>"Come on, Ino," I murmured. "Give it up, it's done, come back, its not working-"</p><p>I couldn't fight while she was in there. Couldn't fight while I was carrying her. The only thing I could do was run, lead him further and further away, and that wouldn't last forever. Once we hit a break in the trees… once we hit a river or meadow… once there was nothing to hide behind…</p><p><em> Fuck,</em> I thought miserably.</p><p>Ino gasped.</p><p>I felt her chakra surge and nearly stumbled.</p><p>"Ino?"</p><p><em> Please let her have ended the jutsu.</em></p><p>Another of Kidomaru's arrows whirled past, and I jerked to the side.</p><p>"Why do you run?" He called. "It's futile. You're going to die, regardless of whether you struggle or not."</p><p>He was close. No time.</p><p>I spun around the tree trunk, slapping my palms down on the bark. "Flashbang. Touch Blast." I called up a posse of Illusionary Clones and sent them all off in different directions. It wasn't much, but it would have to do.</p><p>Then I dove downwards and bore us both deep into the ground, as the light <em> flared</em> . Ino wasn't moving, wasn't doing anything. I needed distance to put her somewhere safe.</p><p>She struggled against me, thrashing at barely more than an instinctual level as the ground closed around us. I curved a bubble of chakra around our faces, trapping the air there so she could breathe.</p><p>"Relax, Ino," I hissed. "It's me! Stop fighting."</p><p>"Itaidōshin," she muttered, but absently, like she wasn't really talking to me at all. "Itaidōshin."</p><p><em> Different body; same mind.</em> It was an idiom, but she was muttering it like a mantra, which couldn't be good. It had been <em> years</em> since Ino had needed a mantra to focus well enough to do her Mind-Body Switch.</p><p>I pulled her deeper underground, sifting the dirt to keep pulling oxygen to our faces. Moving two people was a hell of a lot harder than moving myself, and many orders of magnitude more difficult than just pulling someone underground.</p><p>All the while, I kept a steady focus on Kidomaru's chakra. It staggered around above us, which was probably the result of taking a second Flashbang straight to the face, and the follow up explosion. I really hoped that he took the bait and followed one of the clones off. They couldn't really go far - Illusionary Clones didn't have much of a range - but all it would take would be a single sighting for him to follow up. Hell, as long as he didn't just start shooting the ground up.</p><p>I shuffled us along, slowly moving around the tree roots and rocks.</p><p>I waited as he moved, waited until he was gone, then waited some more, just in case it was a trap. Then I hauled us to the surface, because you could only spend so long underground, and my chakra was starting to run really low.</p><p>"Ino? Come on, Ino," I said, crouching next to her on the grass. "I need you here with me."</p><p>"Itaidōshin," she chanted. It was hard to tell with pupil-less eyes, but she was staring vacantly. She wasn't tracking movement.</p><p>I ran a hand through my bangs in frustration and tried to think. She was out. She was definitely out. I needed to get her somewhere safe before Kidomaru came back or-</p><p><em> Damnit, our mission isn't their mission.</em></p><p>I cursed and thumbed the switch on my comm. "Kiba, look out. Kidomaru is probably incoming your way." Then, because the others were probably listening, and imagination could be so <em> much</em> more distracting than the truth, I added, "Ino is down but not badly hurt. I'll be with you in a second."</p><p>I hoped that the comm distance was enough to reach him.</p><p>"<em> I hear you. Akamaru's on lookout."</em></p><p>I nodded, breathed deeply, and hauled Ino over my shoulder again. "Let's get you somewhere safe."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I've been pretty bad about answering reviews recently, but I do appreciate them all. Uh, I'll try and go over them if anyone has any actual questions that they wanted answered, or y'know, just ask again. XD</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sound Four Arc: Chapter 60</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: So my intention of having this chapter done faster than the last one didn't really work out. My laptop seems to be about a few days from complete collapse, so there are a few issues. Sorry 'bout that, it can't really be helped.</p><p>Norumai and Diamond Pawn have started a website with a chapter guide to DOS. It's got some neat summaries and links to all the other stuff people have done, so you should check it out. Link is, as always, in my profile.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 60</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore. ~ Vincent van Gogh</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I stashed Ino in the roots of a tree where she would hopefully be out of the way until she was aware again. It was the best I could do on short notice, and I trapped the entrance, but it was far from perfect.</p><p>There wasn't really any other option, though. I couldn't keep carting her around.</p><p>Then I cut back towards Konoha, hoping I could reach Kiba before Kidomaru did. It would largely depend on how quickly Kidomaru gave up searching for us, or realised that the trails were all fake. It was a tossup; if he got bored of it quickly, then he wouldn't keep it up. But on the other hand, if I <em> had</em> annoyed him really badly, he'd want to kill me over completing the mission.</p><p>Funny how I was <em> hoping</em> for that.</p><p>I leapt through the trees, calculating the distance that the fight had taken us, the direction Kiba had gone and his speed to come up with a likely intercept vector. Depending on how fast Kidomaru was… how long it took him to turn back… well. I <em> might</em> get there first.</p><p>Kiba had managed to cover a surprising amount of distance, and I had to pace myself in running or I'd be no use by the time I got there. It was frustrating, with a side order of panic, because if we lost Sasuke…</p><p><em> Not going to happen,</em> I thought firmly. <em> We're not going to lose anyone.</em></p><p>I breathed in and out, and the last pulse of adrenaline settled, as I fell into the measured pace that would let you run all day.</p><p>It was a little odd being alone after heading out with a partner and group. It left me feeling tense, anxious, knowing there were enemies out there and I had no one to watch my back.</p><p>"<em> Shit,"</em> Kiba cursed through the comm. It was a little fuzzy, so it was probably coming through Sasuke's microphone rather than a deliberate activation.</p><p>"Almost there, Kiba," I said, estimating how much further ahead he was. I'd found his trail, and while I wasn't exactly a tracker, he wasn't being stealthy either.</p><p>I could hear scuffling, but there were no shouts or cries of pain. That was… well, probably a good sign.</p><p>I put on a burst of speed, bounding through the trees and zeroing in on Kiba's chakra. I knew something was wrong when I couldn't sense Kidomaru, but there was <em> someone</em> there.</p><p>Or <em> something,</em> rather, as I got close enough to see the giant spider.</p><p>Giant, as in, the size of a horse, rather than your regular 'giant' spiders.</p><p><em> Eww.</em> Was my first thought. Then <em> summon, of course he has a summon.</em></p><p>There was no sign of Sasuke's barrel either, which added up to a not so pretty picture.</p><p><em> First problem first,</em> I thought, hanging back to take in the scene. The spider was high in the trees, supported easily on a thick strand of web about as thick as my wrist. That wouldn't have been enough to protect it, but it was highly mobile, swinging to a new position every time it was attacked, and letting loose a rain of freshly hatched spiderlings that were about as big as Akamaru normally was.</p><p>Akamaru and Kiba were both in their Beast Human Clone and even I couldn't tell them apart. Actually… there was some kind of chakra bond between them, which only made more sense the longer I thought about it. How else did they merge characteristics like that otherwise? No wonder the Inuzuka were so attached to their dogs.</p><p>They were fighting well, but the smaller spiders were leaving trails of sticky web everywhere, and just kept converging, no matter how many of them they fought off. Sooner of later, they'd step on something and get stuck and then it would only be a matter of time before they ended up cocooned in silk.</p><p>Given the vast number of them, I was doubtful that Shadow Possession would be helpful. It <em> was</em> possible to contain multiple targets but there was a marked difference between ten and a hundred. And with my chakra running low I wouldn't be able to hold it long even if I <em> did</em> manage to catch them…</p><p>But the smaller spiders were coming from the larger one, which meant it was the anchor for the summoning jutsu. Get rid of that, and you got rid of them.</p><p>I cast another look down at Kiba and Akamaru, before tucking my fingers into my weapons pouch and spooling out lengths of ninja wire.</p><p>Shurikenjutsu and ninja wire were incredibly overlooked skills, I thought idly, as my shuriken arched through the air, trailing wire behind them. The fingers of my off hand clamped down on the wire, chakra holding and protecting the skin from the razor edge.</p><p>The shuriken reached the end of their freedom and curved, pulling back and winding around and around.</p><p><em> Gotcha.</em></p><p>I hauled backwards, taking the slack out of the line, and the spider made a squealing sound as its legs were compressed together.</p><p>"Kiba!" I shouted.</p><p>The two of them gathered themselves and <em> jumped</em> , twisting free of the mass of spiders on the ground and into a spin.</p><p>"<em> Fang Over Fang</em> !"</p><p>They drilled through the air, curving around until they crashed into the spider, equal force on opposite sides. I admired the precision and timing of it, even as the force of the attack caused the trees to shake.</p><p>Then it exploded into web.</p><p>"Gah!" I cried, flinging my arm up to shield my face. Kiba and Akamaru tore through it, the spinning of their attack sending it everywhere, even as it wound it tighter around them. They lost control of the technique, unable to change directions and crashed aimlessly around in the branches before burying themselves in the ground and coming to a stop.</p><p>I blinked, shook my hair out of my eyes, scanned the clearing to double check that everything was gone, and jumped after them.</p><p>"Have a nice trip?" I sardonically asked Kiba's foot, where it was kicking half-heartedly out of the ground.</p><p>He made a muffled sound in reply that I chose to translate as '<em> please help me'. </em> His foot kicked again, and I gripped his ankle and hauled him backwards, a shower of dirt and debris and Kiba half wrapped like a coocoon.</p><p>I snickered. "Comfortable?"</p><p>He gave me a disgruntled glare. "Where's Akamaru?"</p><p>Akamaru, having released his Beast Human Clone form, had had much better luck wiggling out of his bindings. He barked once, in reassurance.</p><p>"Better off than you are," I said, kneeling and taking out the lightsaber to help cut away the web. "So what happened?"</p><p>"Dude appeared out of nowhere," Kiba said gruffly, holding still. "Did some freaky shit with kunai and everything, but I couldn't really fight back while holding the barrel. Course, once I put it down, he summoned that thing and nicked off with it."</p><p>"And even if you won, you'd have been too tied up to come after him…" I finished. <em> Clever.</em> Of course, that assumed he hadn't been able to just take Kiba out right away. "Was he still transformed?"</p><p>Kiba frowned. "Actually, no. He wasn't doing that weird black ink thing either. That important?"</p><p>I shrugged. "It means there's at least a time or usage limit to the curse mark. That's good news."</p><p>"Hallelujah. At least <em> something</em> is good." He grimaced and stood up, shaking as much dirt off as he could.</p><p>"Ready to go after him?" I asked, standing and stretching. Everything was starting to ache, now that I had a moment to breathe, but it was all minor injuries.</p><p>"When you are," Kiba said, with an assessing glance. His gaze lingered on my neck for a second, but the cut had clotted up and was no longer bleeding. He scooped up Akamaru and tucked him into his jacket.</p><p>I nodded. "Lead the way, then. The faster we catch up to him the better."</p><p>Them in possession of Sasuke was bad, but we were still at an advantage. They were separated. We were a hell of a lot closer to Konoha than to Sound. Kiba and I weren't far behind Kidomaru. We could still turn this to a victory.</p><p>Kiba led, jumping back to the spider mess, presumably to get a scent trail before taking off at an angle. I followed easily, trusting Kiba to be able to track our target.</p><p>"Well," Kiba said, breaking the silence as we bounced through the trees. "I tell you what… I'm not going to let Shino know I just killed a giant spider."</p><p>The unexpectedness of the comment caused me to snort. "Afraid he'll smother you in your sleep?"</p><p>"Nah, just make me feel like a horrible, heartless person." He grinned. "It's just as bad as making Hinata upset. And Kurenai-sensei backs them both up." He shook his head.</p><p>"Like you've never hit them with the puppy eyes," I bantered back. "You'd think you'd be safe with spiders, though. Arachnids eat insects and all that. Well, most of them."</p><p>He shrugged. "I just don't want to risk it." He wasn't really serious about it. It wasn't like it was something we <em> could</em> leave out of the report, and anyway, Shino was ninja enough to understand that an enemy was an enemy, no matter what they looked like. But the joke was… relaxing.</p><p>I smirked. "So, what? You pinned it down, and then me and Akamaru hit it with a Fang Over Fang?"</p><p>Kiba barked a startled laugh. "Yeah, lets go with that. Can't deny Akamaru the glory, right?"</p><p>"Exactly. And no one can be angry at him. It's a win-win situation."</p><p>Akamaru barked happily, sticking his head out of Kiba's jacket. He didn't look any worse for wear, and I was glad about that.</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "Okay, so, a rundown of abilities. Summons, obviously. You've seen the webs. Super strong, sticky and infused with chakra; they're beyond our ability to break with brute force. He seems to be able to manufacture weapons through a second type of secretion - the gold one - with a preference for projectiles, kunai, arrows, that kind of thing."</p><p>"I did wonder…" Kiba said, trailing off. "I mean, anytime you see non-standard equipment it usually means <em> something.</em> "</p><p>"Right. He can also use that one as a form of armour, coating it over his body. I don't know what it would take to damage it, but he shook off a couple of explosions." The kunai it made had <em> acted</em> like kunai, meaning it probably had equivalent strength of metal, otherwise they would have broken or shattered when blocked with real metal. They hadn't.</p><p>Kiba frowned. "Akamaru and I have been working on a new move," he said. "It'll tear through pretty much anything but we won't be much good for anything else afterwards. It kinda takes a lot out of us."</p><p>I nodded thoughtfully. "Alright. So we have to make sure it works if we use it." I hesitated then added, "I threw pretty much everything at him. I don't know if we really have many options. Given that's he's in possession of Sasuke, I think taking him out is probably the priority. We'll just have to hope that the others have better luck at capturing their targets."</p><p>Because if it came down to blowing the mission, and letting him get away with Sasuke, I knew which option I was going to take.</p><p>"Works for me," Kiba said, with a nod.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"I think he's stopped moving," Kiba said, sniffing the air.</p><p>I nodded. "Let's be on high alert then. If he's resting, he'll have trapped the area. No doubt about that."</p><p>"Good point," Kiba said, shifting Akamaru to sit on his head in a sentry position. "We won't let him get away this time."</p><p>"No, we won't," I agreed.</p><p>We cut our speed down and edged closer, eyes peeled for traps.</p><p>"Tripwires," Kiba said softly.</p><p>"Wait." I held up a hand and crouched down to look at it. "They're doubled. But…" I eyed the wires curiously, then stood and scanned the forest. I could see light glinting off several other wires, covering all the easy paths in.</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>Heavy in the air was the feeling of Kidomaru's chakra. It was too … thin, too dispersed for me to pinpoint exactly, like a haze or mist, but it was there. And knowing that he embued his webs with it led me to the easy conclusion.</p><p>"I think he has web traps as well. Web tripwires? I don't think it's thick enough to actually trap us…" I trailed off. "It's much lighter and thinner than the webs he used before. But it is <em> everywhere.</em> "</p><p>"So, what? Like a warning system?" Kiba frowned at the trees, like he could see it.</p><p>"Exactly like," I agreed.</p><p>"So do we go around, or do we go through?" He cast a glance at me.</p><p>I breathed in, thinking swiftly. If we went around, we might get the advantage of surprise. <em> Might.</em> Depending on how far in each direction he had trapped, and how good we were at noticing it. If we went through, he'd know we were coming, but we wouldn't lose any time. We'd have to face whatever traps and plans he had for us, though.</p><p>"Through," I decided. "Try to avoid the actual traps though."</p><p>Kiba grinned, a little fierce and wild. "Now we're talking."</p><p>We crept forward, avoiding the traps we could see, and being wary of any surprises. Eventually, Kidomaru came into my range, along with Sasuke. Both were exerting some kind of <em> drain</em> or <em> pull</em> on the chakra around them, which made sense. The curse seal <em> had</em> been based on some kind of bastardised sage mode, after all. They were recuperating.</p><p>He'd chosen a good spot for it, too. Kidomaru sat atop the barrel in the middle of a field, far from the shadows of the trees. More than a clearing, it was probably a firebreak, a huge swath of clear ground between sections of the forest to stop the seasonal wildfires from travelling.</p><p>"So you've finished with Kyodaigumo already," he said. "That's … faster than I expected." There was an edge of irritation in his voice, but no particularly worry.</p><p>"Jerk," Kiba growled, and launched himself out of the trees and across the open ground. By the time he hit the dirt he was already running on four legs, the extra stabilisation and agility of the Inuzuka style taijutsu letting him pivot and dodge the incoming projectiles with increased ease.</p><p>And because Kiba was so much like Naruto, I had half expected 'tackle it head on' to be his opening move anyway.</p><p>Kidomaru wasn't using his curse seal - not even the first state - which was promising as long as we didn't let it lure us into a false state of security. He was plenty deadly without it.</p><p>I sprung left, trying to circle around and hit him from the other side. We had superior numbers and we <em> had</em> to take advantage of it.</p><p>It wasn't easy. For every attack I dodged, it seemed like there were another two coming. For every earth wall I created to block, my chakra drained just that little bit more. Every step closer I took, I was forced back again.</p><p><em> Play the long game,</em> I could remember dad advising me. <em> Use each move as a set up for the next.</em></p><p>The field of battle wasn't a shogi match, wasn't anything <em> like</em> a shogi match in the strictest of terms, but it was still good advice. For a second, I took it all in. Me standing <em> here,</em> Kiba <em> there</em> , the barrel with Sasuke, Kidomaru, my half crumbling maze of earth walls. It wasn't shogi but for a second it seemed like connect the dots.</p><p>I caught Kiba's eye, little passing between us except '<em> now'.</em></p><p>On his next pivot his hand reached back, grabbing a handful of smoke bombs and hurling them forward. My shadow lashed out, wall to wall to wall, around and closer and closer.</p><p><em> Shadow Possession Complete.</em></p><p>"Akamaru!" Kiba shouted. "Dynamic Marking!"</p><p>Akamaru howled in response and I heard Kidomaru's cry of disgust. The smoke was starting to clear now, and I could see their outlines once more.</p><p>"Alright boy," Kiba said, crouching down. "<em> Inuzuka style; Human Beast Combination Transformation; Double-Headed Wolf!"</em></p><p>A huge cloud of chakra smoke gusted out and their chakra merged and combined. It was stronger, <em> far stronger</em> , than either of them had been before.</p><p><em> Synergy,</em> I thought. <em> The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.</em></p><p>The result wolf was huge, too, maybe twice the height of a man at the shoulders, with wicked looking teeth and claws.</p><p>Kidomaru's chakra flared, the black ink of the first level curse seal spilling across his skin. But as I'd expected, it was weaker than it had been before, and even with the additional distance of my shadow, he wasn't able to escape.</p><p>"<em> FANG WOLF FANG!" </em> They howled, and leapt forward, spinning violently.</p><p>Wind blasted at me, gusts created my the spiralling, even before the drill <em> slammed</em> into Kidomaru. It happened too fast for me to disengage and I tumbled across the grass, thrown back brutally with the relayed force acting on him, the jutsu broken from the sheer strength of it.</p><p>I rolled, disorientated, pulling my arms and legs in close and tasting dirt.</p><p>Then everything went silent. I wobbled up onto an arm and knee, ready to <em> try</em> and fight if our last gambit had failed.</p><p>No attacks happened.</p><p>I pushed myself up, shaking my head as my ears started ringing and made my way back across the clearing. Kiba and Akamaru had severed the jutsu and were back to themselves, panting on the ground.</p><p>Kidomaru…</p><p>Kidomaru was in several pieces. There was scattered gold plating around that told me he'd tried to protect himself but it hadn't worked.</p><p>"That attack," Kiba said hoarsely. "Is so strong that it creates a vortex that can rip a man apart without even touching them. The spin is so fast we can't see while we're doing it."</p><p>"Good work," I said, eventually. "Are you okay to move? We need to-"</p><p>"-head back, yeah, I know," he said. "Give me a few minutes?" He looked wiped out, and his chakra was barely there at all. He hadn't been kidding when he'd said it took a lot out of them.</p><p>I nodded and went over to Sasuke's barrel to right it. It had been knocked over by the attack, just the same as I had, but seemed to be unharmed.</p><p>Then I straightened apprehensively and stared at the horizon.</p><p>"Kiba?" I said, and tried not to let fear tinge my voice. "We need to move. <em> Now."</em></p><p>Because there was someone incoming, and fast.</p><p>And they were coming from the wrong direction to be <em> our</em> backup.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sound Four Arc: Chapter 61</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: So, as an aside… does anyone else think that Kabuto poisoned Kimimaro? Just something about his smug, smirky air during those episodes made it seem like he was gloating. Granted, there's no particular <em> reason</em> that it would benefit him to take Kimimaro out of the picture, but Kabuto is hard to understand.</p><p>Anemos - Shikako at this stage is only capable of the general illusionary clone, which in my head canon at least, requires immediate direction and isn't capable of doing much, anyway. So leaving a clone wouldn't have been helpful. Kidomaru's summon was the giant spider that they fought, which he used to distract Kiba before grabbing the barrel. He couldn't actually summon the barrel, sorry if it seemed that way.</p><p>Nemesis Jedi - yes, Kiba's attack should have been seen again. It was awesome. Although, I'm not sure I remember him ever having another <em> fight scene</em> so…</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 61</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Hold your head up high - for there is no greater love</em></p><p><em> Think of the faces of the people you defend</em></p><p><em> And promise me, they will never see the tears within our eyes</em></p><p><em> Although we are men, with mortal sins, angels never cry ~ Winterbourne; Cruxshadows.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I grabbed Sasuke's barrel, hefting it awkwardly in my arms and turning to run, even as I doubted that I would get away. They were already so close.</p><p>But standing our ground wasn't any better of an option. Not with Kiba out of chakra, and myself close behind. Defeating Kidomaru hadn't left us in a very good situation for having to fight again.</p><p>I hadn't even made it to the tree line when something heavy landed atop the barrel, forcing it to the ground and barely missing my exposed toes. I froze.</p><p>For a split second, everything was still.</p><p>I stared into green, green eyes, narrowed with the faintest hint of interest; could feel warm air puffing on my face as we breathed; could smell blood and disinfectant, the sharp, impersonal tang of a hospital; could feel his chakra, hard and dense, yet strangely stripped bare, like bones exposed to the elements.</p><p>Then I dove to the side, ducking and rolling as his hand whistled sharply through the place where my head had been, and time resumed.</p><p><em> Kimimaro.</em></p><p>Kimimaro. Last of the Kaguya Clan. Wielder of the Shikotsumyaku - the Dead Bone Pulse Bloodline limit - that let him manipulate his own skeleton. Who was capable of fighting Gaara and Lee to a standstill.</p><p><em> We are in trouble.</em></p><p>"Who the hell are you?" Kiba barked, struggling to his feet.</p><p>Kimimaro ignored him, eyes flickering over the clearing until they landed on Kidomaru. "How pathetic," he observed, voice detached and almost clinical. "To have died without completing his duty."</p><p>"No compassion for the death of a comrade?" I asked, cynically. I needed to stall, bargaining on the hope that the others would finish with their opponents soon. There were three other teams, if even <em> one</em> of them had finished fighting and was in any condition to continue then they'd come after us.</p><p>His eyes came back to me, and there was something in them that was heavy and intense. "His only worth was that which he could give to Orochimaru-sama. To have failed in that purpose erases any value he may have had."</p><p>He really, truly meant it, I realised, with the absolute certainty of conviction that you would use to say 'the grass is green' or 'the sky is blue'. This thing is so. It wasn't fervour, he wasn't even trying to convince me… it just <em> was.</em></p><p>Typical of Orochimaru, to have claimed their absolute loyalty for himself and left them nothing for each other. It was also worrisome. If all their 'worth' was tied up in completing the mission… if failure was worse than death…</p><p><em> Well, I already knew he wasn't going to give up or back down.</em></p><p>"That must be lonely," I remarked, instead of questioning whether it was worth it. I was trying to stall, not antagonise him.</p><p><em> Something</em> flickered across his face, too fast to understand.</p><p>"It is irrelevant," he said. "The only thing that matters now is for me to return Orochimaru-sama's favoured vessel to him."</p><p>"Like we're just going to <em> let</em> you do that," Kiba scoffed, voice low and almost growling.</p><p>The look Kimimaro gave him, slow and disinterested, was the epitome of 'and just what do you think you could do to stop me?'</p><p>The answer was somewhere along the lines of 'not a lot'. Heck, even if we'd been at full strength - which we most definitely were not - the odds would have been against us.</p><p>"This is the body that Orochimaru-sama desires as his vessel. I will bring it to him. That is my purpose," he explained.</p><p>"This body, the vessel," Kiba spat. "You talk like he isn't even a person. Sasuke is our comrade, and I <em> won't let you take him.</em> "</p><p>He dragged up the last, straggling remains of his chakra and crouched down, teeth and nails lengthening. "Beast Mimicry; Four Legs Jutsu!"</p><p>My shadow, which had been pooling innocuously on the ground, and sneaking up the sides of the barrel, lashed out, trying to cover the distance to Kimimaro. I gritted my teeth at the sudden strain, aware of how low my own chakra was falling.</p><p>Kimimaro <em> moved,</em> swift, agile and effortless. One foot caught the edge of the barrel as he leapt, pressing back and down, ripping it from my shadowy grip and forcing the whole thing into the air. He landed, gracefully, on the grass, one hand grabbing Kiba's outstretched arm as he lunged, sliding around the attack like water around a stone and pulling Kiba off balance and open. My eyes caught the barest glimpse of something sharp and white in the end of his long sleeve before Kimimaro buried a bone dagger in his gut.</p><p>Then he turned, finishing his rotation, and caught Sasuke's barrel as it started to descend, tucking it under one arm.</p><p>All of it in a second, maybe less.</p><p>"Kiba!" I shouted, eyes wide as he collapsed onto the ground, on hand tight around his abdomen. Akamaru <em> howled.</em></p><p>I wanted to check on him. Depending on where he got hit, how deep and how hard… that was all the difference between a minor wound and a fatal blow.</p><p>Except Kimimaro had Sasuke.</p><p><em> Who do you chose?</em></p><p>If Kimimaro was fast enough to get here, fast enough to do that… if he got away with Sasuke we'd never catch him. If he got away, it'd all be for nothing.</p><p><em> Sorry, Kiba,</em> I thought apologetically.</p><p>Given Kimimaro's show of prowess at close combat fighting, the tactical thing would have been to withdraw and keep to mid or long range combat and hope to find a weakness there. Mid range combat was the speciality of the Shadow Possession jutsu, after all. The trouble with that, though, was that my chakra was running too low to hold someone in Possession for very long - <em> if</em> I could catch him - and if Kidomaru could break my hold with it, then there was no doubt that Kimimaro could do the same.</p><p>Given the flat ground, lack of shadows and lack of cover… the numerous directions which Kimimaro could take to leave… our <em> objectives</em> … He could evade any traps I tried to set ahead of him. I doubted I had the energy for a pursuit either, if he managed to slip past me. I had to actually be able to engage, delay or stop him.</p><p><em> Focus,</em> I thought. <em> Focus. There is a way to do this. There is </em> always<em> a way.</em></p><p>It was just that, right now, when I was low on chakra with my team mate injured, with no indication when or <em> if</em> there was ever going to be backup, that seemed like a meaningless platitude.</p><p>I felt very small and alone.</p><p>"Trash like you cannot hope to stand in the way of Orochimaru-sama's desires," Kimimaro said blandly.</p><p>"I really don't care what Orochimaru desires," I said. "Sasuke is my friend, and Orochimaru wants to destroy him in a very fundamental way. So I can't let that happen."</p><p>Saying it… putting it in to words like that… made it real. Made it true. I <em> couldn't</em> let that happen. Not because it would bring about a bad future, or because it would strengthen Orochimaru or weaken Konoha, not because of any ideal of 'the mission' or 'comrades', but because it was <em> Sasuke.</em> He was my friend, my team mate and we'd spent the past few months living, working, <em> trusting</em> together.</p><p>I <em> couldn't.</em></p><p>It didn't magically give me the solution to defeat him, but it gave me resolve.</p><p>I sprung forward, without tensing to telegraph my moves, curving low towards the side that held the barrel where he'd have less sight and mobility. There was only a slim possibility that he <em> wasn't</em> expecting it, because it was such an <em> obvious</em> attack path.</p><p>He leapt over my sweeping leg kick, coming down as I spun upwards, leading with a back fist that he caught easily with a forearm block. My arm juddered against his, and I knew in a contest of strength that I would lose. There was no give to him, not at all.</p><p>That was alright. I didn't need to make it a contest of strength.</p><p>I twisted my arm around, palm coming to lay flat on his forearm, fingers curling into the curve of the muscle there.</p><p>"Touch Blast," I breathed. I had to set it properly; I'd only get one shot at this.</p><p>His chakra system nearly disrupted the seal even as I was setting it, but I forced it down, overriding it with gritted teeth. His eyes widened, just slightly, and I felt his chakra spike even as I felt the flesh beneath my hands ripple. I tried to pull back the second the seal was set, but I was too slow to get completely clear. Bones burst from his arm, curving slightly upwards towards his hand. The first went straight through my palm, grating along my metacarpals and puncturing the protective plate sewn on to the back of my gloves. The second dug into the soft flesh of my underarm, and I felt the wet slide of blood start immediately.</p><p>The pain was a thundering roar of terror and adrenaline. My arm burnt hot, hot, <em> hot</em> , making the rest of me feel cold and dark.</p><p>Then he ripped his arm away.</p><p>I <em> shrieked.</em></p><p>His foot hammered into my ribs, a solid blow that was thankfully lacking in spikes, sending me tumbling backwards across the grass. I rolled with the movement, knowing I had to get away, had to get distance.</p><p>Then the seal went up.</p><p>The explosion kicked up a lot of smoke and dust, but I didn't dare take my eyes off the spot where Kimimaro was. I felt another chakra signature brush my senses, clear and bright like glass or crystal - a Hyuuga? God, I hoped Neji had finished with his fight - but I couldn't spare the attention to track it. I needed everything, right here, right now.</p><p>The dust settled, and I despaired.</p><p>Kimimaro glanced down at his arm with detachment, flexing his hand, looking at the bone plating over his forearm where skin <em> should</em> have been, slick with blood, and at the dish shaped growth out of his upper arm that had caught and redirected most of the explosions effects. His shirt had been shredded, and there were burns littered across his chest and legs, but he barely appeared to notice them.</p><p><em> How vexing.</em></p><p>"This bone is as hard as tempered steel," he said. "And I can form and reform it at will. Your attacks are quite useless."</p><p>I'd set the seal <em> on</em> him. No way to evade it, or escape the effects, and it had <em> still</em> barely damaged him. Even if - and that was a big if - I managed to get him again, what good would it do?</p><p>I struggled onto my knees, hand clamped on top of my bleeding wrist, aware that it shouldn't have taken so much effort to get upright.</p><p><em> Blood loss?</em> I hoped not. If it was hitting me so fast, then he had <em> definitely</em> sliced something important. I swallowed a sharp bite of fear at the thought. <em> Could just be chakra exhaustion. Pain. Concussion. You've been thrown around a lot. </em></p><p>Not that it would matter if I didn't do something <em> now.</em> No point worrying about what my injuries would do if I didn't survive the fight.</p><p>"Akamaru," a hoarse voice ordered. "Tunnelling Fang!"</p><p>I whipped my head around to see Kiba, half propped up and grimacing with pain. Akamaru was growing, bigger and redder, the same way he had during the preliminaries after eating a soldier pill.</p><p>I felt a surge of hope as he snarled and leapt forward, spinning into the attack and charging at Kimimaro.</p><p>Who slapped him out of the air.</p><p>My breath froze in my lungs and that surge of hope died, like a fluttering candle in the wind.</p><p>Akamaru tumbled across the ground, regaining his feet and snarling angrily. He darted forwards, low and agile, teeth bared.</p><p>I couldn't make a hand seal, but that didn't mean I couldn't do <em> anything.</em> I focused chakra into my shadow, forehead crinkling with the extra effort that it took, and sent it forward. Maybe if he was distracted I could catch him…</p><p>It stretched, and stretched…</p><p>Then slowly, agonisingly, no matter how much I tried to force it forward, it returned to me.</p><p><em> Out of chakra.</em></p><p><em> Out. Of. Chakra.</em></p><p>"You are… annoyingly persistent," Kimimaro said, knocking Akamaru back <em> again</em> . He held up his ruined hand, fingers splayed wide. "Five-Finger Drilling Bullets."</p><p>The small bones from the tips of his fingers - phalanges, a distant part of my mind noted - shot out, rotating like drills. Although they were small, I had no doubt that they could do a whole lot of damage, given they way that a stationary attack had ripped up my arm.</p><p>I dropped to the ground, awkwardly trying to roll even as I realised that the others wouldn't be able to.</p><p>But they never hit. Someone leapt, full speed, from the trees and dropped down into the grass, striking the bones out of the air with lightning fast Gentle Fist.</p><p>The chakra that I had noticed before but not really registered.</p><p><em> We have backup!</em></p><p>"I won't let you hurt my friends," a quiet voice said, sounding surprisingly firm.</p><p>"Hinata?" Kiba choked out. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>I stalled, torn between relief and horror. <em> Hinata?</em></p><p>She didn't glance at him, though with a Hyuuga that was redundant. I didn't doubt she had her Byakugan active. She was standing tall and straight, arms held out ready in a classic Jyuuken pose, chin high and eyes <em> blazing.</em></p><p>"When I heard that your mission had gone badly," Hinata said softly. "I knew I had to come."</p><p>"You're going to get hurt!" Kiba objected, sounding anguished. "Hinata..."</p><p>She only lifted her head higher, and for a second she looked almost regal. "I, too, want to protect those people that are precious to me. My friends and comrades… I can't just stand back and watch!"</p><p><em> The Will of Fire…</em></p><p>She was shining with it. The utter, burning determination to never give up. The heat that forged the steel of our backbone, the light that blazed from our eyes. It was the motivation that drove you that extra mile, extra ten miles, hundred miles <em> when it mattered.</em> When everything was on the line, your family behind you, an army in front of you and you just planted your feet and refused to move-</p><p>That was the Will of Fire.</p><p>We talked about it like it was spiritual, like it was religious, like it was something magical and special - that was probably why it got discounted so much by the other nations - but it wasn't, not really.</p><p>Well. We <em> believed</em> in it. That was important, in its own way.</p><p>In the simplest of terms… it was a chakra focusing technique.</p><p>Chakra is a mix of physical and mental energies. Therefore, something that focuses mental energy, that hones <em> every ounce</em> of will power, every thought, every whisper of an idea, on that one. single. target…</p><p>The result is like a wildfire where once burned a candle.</p><p>It's the reason that Naruto becomes so strong when the situation is dire. He refuses to give up and his scattered attention span comes together and <em> obliterates</em> everything in its path.</p><p>And it looked like Hinata had found it too.</p><p>Kimimaro sighed, just softly, and put down the barrel. "To think I would have to use this," he said, holding his hand over his exposed shoulder. The skin split apart, and the bone protruded higher and higher until he could grasp it. "The Dance of the Camellia…"</p><p>He pulled, the bone sliding free of his flesh. The end was sharpened to an ominous point. Then he moved, dashing across the space between them to slash and stab, hand blurring with the speed.</p><p>And Hinata blocked it. Her face was set in concentration, but she blocked it, hands flashing out unerringly. They traded blows back and forth, bone sword to the blue flash of chakra billowing from her hands.</p><p><em> Hinata…</em> I thought wonderingly. But it would only take one mistake, and she wouldn't be able to keep this up forever. Already she was cutting it close, avoiding one swipe with an almost painful looking twist and not being quite fast enough to dodge the follow up that scored a painful looking stripe across her arm.</p><p><em> Help. I need to help her.</em></p><p>I pressed my bleeding arm against my stomach, trying to keep the pressure on it and free up my other hand at the same time. Even if I couldn't fight, I could still <em> help.</em> I wasn't just going to sit by and do nothing. I pulled my kunai pouch off, settling it in front of me and opening the top. My eyes immediately zeroed in on an item I didn't use much, but were helpful enough that I still kept a few.</p><p><em> Smoke bombs.</em></p><p>With her Byakugan on, they wouldn't inhibit Hinata at all, but they <em> might</em> give her a bit of an edge. I only had two, and they were short lasting, especially when there was wind but …</p><p><em> Better than nothing,</em> I thought, pitching one forward as Hinata deflected, dodged and twisted around another barrage of attacks. The thick dark smoke billowed and obscured them from view.</p><p>"Eight Trigrams; Thirty Two Palms." Hinata's voice carried a surety that would have surprised a lot of people. I could feel Kimimaro's chakra moving, likely trying to escape the smoke and regain sight.</p><p>I readied the second smoke bomb, but before I could throw it a second one went off. I glanced over at Kiba and met his eyes for a brief second. He was pale and grimacing, but his aim had been good.</p><p>I managed to throw my last smoke bomb and a few explosive tags around the edges before Kimimaro decided to change tactics. He leapt clear of the smoke, gaining his distance and splayed his hands again.</p><p>"Ten-Finger Drilling Bullets!"</p><p>Hinata's chakra was - either by coincidence or design - between him and Kiba. But I was on my own.</p><p><em> Shit, </em> I thought numbly.</p><p>Then a strong arm wrapped around my waist and hauled me out of the way. I couldn't stop the startled, and a little pained, squeak that escaped my mouth, but as the bullets impacted the ground and kicked up dust I was too relieved to have been pulled out of the way.</p><p>I glanced up at the familiar, green suited form of my rescuer. "Lee. That was <em> excellent</em> timing." I couldn't believe I hadn't noticed him, had he been moving fast, or had I just not been paying attention?</p><p>He beamed, dropping me reasonably gently onto the ground beside Kiba, before unloading the passenger slung over his other shoulder. Bound and unconscious, it was Tayuya.</p><p>I very carefully didn't ask where Shikamaru and Chouji were.</p><p>"Do not worry! I shall assist Hinata in dealing with this threat and then we shall return to Konoha with Sasuke. That is a promise!" He beamed again and gave me a thumbs up, before dashing off.</p><p>I glanced at Tayuya again, checking her bindings and making sure she wouldn't be able to get up and fight. That would be the last thing we needed. Then, keeping half my attention on the fight, I struggled a roll of bandages out of my jacket and started binding my arm. It was clotting and scabbing, which was a good sign, but still bleeding, which wasn't.</p><p>Then I gave what assistance I could to Kiba. Underneath his jacket he's been wearing a protective chest plate, which had minimised <em> some</em> of the damage but not all. The dagger hadn't been removed, and I didn't touch it because it was probably helping stop the bleeding by blocking the wound. I just pressed bandages and cloth around it and tried to press it down.</p><p>"Ah, jeeze, that hurts," Kiba groaned.</p><p>"Sorry." I grimaced and tried for a scolding tone, "but you're supposed to keep the blood on the <em> inside.</em> "</p><p>He snorted. "Looks like you failed that class too."</p><p>"Remedial lessons for the both of us," I agreed. "Think Iruka-sensei would notice if we popped back into his class?" Given how much trouble Iruka-sensei had had getting Kiba to show up to class when he was <em> meant</em> to, we'd probably give him a heart attack.</p><p>Kiba huffed, then groaned again. "Don't make me laugh."</p><p>"Sorry," I murmured again, eyes drifting over to the fight. Neither of them were injured, not like we were, and yet…</p><p>They still didn't seem to be gaining any headway.</p><p>"Think they can…?" Kiba half asked.</p><p>I bit my lip, eyes dropping down to Tayuya's form. What could I say? <em> No, I don't think so. Maybe they can buy us time for… </em> for what, exactly? Where were Shikamaru and Chouji? Where were Naruto and Neji? Had Tsunade sent Lee and Hinata instead of the Sand Siblings? How had they even been there? Would she send anyone else?</p><p>We'd had a big team. Maybe she wouldn't.</p><p>"Yeah," Kiba said when I didn't answer. "He hasn't even used his seal."</p><p>Lee and Hinata were fighting well together. It was clear that Lee had experience fighting beside a Jyuuken user, and Hinata was well trained in looking out for her team mates. But that didn't change the fact that he was supposed to be in hospital and was recovering from a career ending injury.</p><p>"Protection of the Eight Trigrams; Sixty Four Palms," Hinata incanted, moving her hand in a sweeping arc through the air. A ribbon of pale blue chakra trailed from her hand, and she moved faster and faster, <em> weaving</em> a net like dome around herself. Kimimaro's attack hit it, the bones not just being repelled but appearing to get <em> shredded</em> by it.</p><p>"Huh," I managed.</p><p>"I have never seen that before," Kiba replied in response to my unasked question.</p><p>It was … impressive. An ultimate defence like the Kaiten that <em> didn't</em> require being able to expel chakra from every tenketsu, nor being able to control it after. Just your hands, and flexibility.</p><p>On the other side of the fight, behind them, I noticed that Sasuke's barrel had started giving off dark chakra, almost like it was smoking.</p><p>My eyes narrowed.</p><p>"Your style is too direct, too obvious," Kimimaro lectured, throwing Lee back as his initiating kick to the Primary Lotus was blocked by bones extending out of his ribcage. "It leaves… too… many… openings!" He punctuated each word with a strike, leaving Lee dazed and bloody. "And you," he turned to Hinata, dancing around her lashing hand so smoothly it looked effortless. Chakra expelled harmlessly into the air, punctuating the fight with booms and flashes. "Too defensive. Too hesitant. Every opening you refuse to take is a mistake. Are you so afraid of being hurt that you will not attack?"</p><p>"I'm not afraid," Hinata said quietly, lifting her hands back into an attacking position.</p><p>There was a flicker of chakra - red as fire, red as anger - but despite the fact that it made my heart skip a beat, it also made me grin with relief. "You tell him, Hinata," Naruto said, landing in a crouch that was a little too stooped to be completely human. Red chakra was burning around him, not yet forming a tail or cloak, but enough to be visible. If you looked closely, the lines on his face were deep marks, and his teeth and nails more like fangs and claws.</p><p>"Another one?" Kimimaro asked, his blank mask of disdain creasing with irritation for a second. "There sure is a lot of trash around here."</p><p>"The only trash here is you!" Naruto retorted, the edge of a snarl in his voice. "Shadow Clone Jutsu!"</p><p>"Multiplying zero still makes zero," Kimimaro said, glancing at the horde of clones.</p><p>"We're taking Sasuke back," Naruto growled, the statement coming from more than one throat.</p><p>"Do try," Kimimaro said.</p><p>Two of the Naruto's darted forward, coming at Kimimaro with a pincer attack. A few more echoed them, waiting for an opening caused by the first. The rest paired off and began forming Rasengan between them.</p><p>I couldn't tell which Naruto was the real one, and there were too many people moving about, orange and yellow and red and Hinata was sliding through the bodies to attack and retreat and Lee was on his feet again -</p><p>- and one of the clones, inches from being stabbed, instead of ducking and dodging, used an almost seamless Replacement Jutsu with one of the Rasengan holding clones -</p><p>- and Kimimaro <em> twisted</em> changing directions on a dime, letting it sail harmlessly over his shoulder -</p><p>- and in the instant the others tried to take advantage of his movement, spikes as long as spears shot out from his sides and he <em> spun</em> -</p><p>Hinata's hand flashed through the air, forming a protective cage of chakra around her, Lee threw himself backwards, evading the circle of death, and Naruto snarled, tumbling backwards with clones shredding where they stood.</p><p>"His taijutsu," Lee murmured. "There's not a single movement wasted…"</p><p>Kimimaro didn't pause, sliding so smoothly across the ground that it barely seemed like he was touching it, spike protruding from the palm of his hand and aimed directly for Naruto's heart -</p><p>"Summoning Jutsu: Gamatoutou!" Naruto howled, slamming his hands down on the ground.</p><p>The explosion of chakra smoke cleared to reveal a toad, as tall as a man, dressed in a samurai style cuirass and pauldrons, with two swords crossed defensively in front of it, Kimimaro's attack caught in block.</p><p>Gamatoutou's mouth opened and his tongue shot out lightning fast, trying to wrap around Kimimaro. The Sound ninja dodged backwards, slicing at the thick and slimy appendage. Naruto crouched atop the toads head, glowering downwards and bleeding red chakra into the air.</p><p>And then, with a final surge of black chakra, the coffin holding Sasuke fell apart.</p><p>The fighting paused, everyone turning to stare at Sasuke, standing with his head bowed amidst the wreckage of the barrel, his limbs trembling and shaking.</p><p>"Sasuke Uchiha," Kimimaro said. "Orochimaru-sama awaits you. Go; I will fight this trash."</p><p>Sasuke flexed his hands, then peered up through his bangs. "The thing is…" he said, voice a little raspy. "I never intended on going to Orochimaru."</p><p>Kimimaro's face cooled. "I see," he said. "My purpose becomes clear. If I cannot be the vessel he requires, then I must deliver you to him, regardless of your cooperation. My lord's magnificent dream must not be denied!"</p><p>His chakra surged, ink spreading out from the mark in the hollow of his collar bone, ascending straight into the second level, morphing his body into something demonic looking.</p><p>"Oh, shit," Kiba muttered, as Akamaru whimpered. "This is going to be bad."</p><p>"First; you," Kimimaro said, staring at Naruto. He reached up with one hand to the back of his neck and <em> pulled</em> , the bones of his spine sliding out. His other arm grew bones thick around it, forming a twisting cone, like a drill or a spear. "The Dance of the Clematis; Flower and Vine."</p><p>Naruto bared his teeth in a snarl, shifting his stance in preparation to attack -</p><p>- Kimimaro lashed out with the spine, the vertebra sliding against each other, sections between them stretching, and the motion resembled a whip more than a sword. It wrapped around Naruto, binding his arms to his side -</p><p>- he growled, red chakra surging higher -</p><p>- and Kimimaro <em> pulled</em> yanking him forwards, off of his toad, across the ground, and straight into the lance of his other arm.</p><p>"<em> NARUTO</em> !"</p><p>Our voices mingled in combined horror as we shouted, all drowned out by Naruto's scream of anguish, so full of pain it barely even sounded human any more.</p><p><em> No, no, no,</em> I chanted in my mind. <em> It's not- It can't - Naruto!</em></p><p>I was frozen. I couldn't move. I couldn't -</p><p>It couldn't-</p><p>Kimimaro flicked the whip away, unbinding Naruto and letting him slide backwards with a wet cough -</p><p>- Gamatoutou leapt forward, coming to a defence that was far too late -</p><p>- Hinata pushed off the ground, flying forward, eyes wide with horror -</p><p>- and Sasuke <em> screamed</em> , bursting forward, lightning crackling in his hand, ink bleeding across his skin and Sharingan eyes spinning so fast I couldn't even see the tomoe any longer -</p><p>- I was on my feet, helplessly straining for <em> something</em> to do, help <em> someone, please -</em></p><p>- the Chidori impacted, flaring eye searingly bright -</p><p>- and Sasuke tumbled across the ground.</p><p>"You're strong," Kimimaro said. "Good. I would hate for Orochimaru-sama's next vessel to be weak."</p><p>"I will <em> kill you,"</em> Sasuke screamed. The transformation had taken hold, darkening his skin and blacking his eyes. There was a blue star spreading across the bridge of his nose and his lips were bruised dark purple. He looked <em> furious.</em> He hurled himself forward again, spitting a great tongue of fire ahead of him -</p><p>- Kimimaro wove and dodged -</p><p>- then there was a great, earth shaking <em> roar,</em> and red, redred<em> red </em> chakra blossomed, so thick it was tangible, was solid, was heavy like gravity -</p><p><em> - and Naruto stood up.</em></p><p>"You're really," he rasped. "Pissing me off!" His chakra folded in, wrapping around him like a shroud as he crouched on all fours, looking more feral than Kiba ever managed. It shaped around him, body first, then dragging out into a tail<em> , </em> then claws and ears…</p><p>I collapsed down to my knees, relief and terror warring within me. <em> He's okay, he's okay, he'sokay…</em></p><p>"Took you long enough, dead last," Sasuke said unevenly.</p><p>"I was… just letting you have a turn," Naruto growled. "Because now, it's going to be <em> over.</em> "</p><p>The two of them attacked together, almost seamlessly despite these new levels of power, as if they'd been doing it every day of their lives. And… it was working.</p><p>Kimimaro retreated, and retreated, and retreated.</p><p>"This is the last attack," he said, flipping away from them and crouching down. "Dance of the Seedling Fern!"</p><p>His chakra rippled, sinking into the ground, then spreading out.</p><p>My eyes widened. "Everyone move! Get off the ground!"</p><p>I spun, hauling Kiba to his feet despite his groan of pain. But he must have believed the urgency, because he clapped his hand around his stomach and moved. Behind us, Gamatoutou swept Lee and Hinata up into his hands and jumped, powerful toad legs sending him soaring high.</p><p>The ground surged, and we had the barest of warnings as it cracked open, leaping up as bone spikes started protruding outwards.</p><p><em> We're not going to make the trees,</em> I realised. We were too far, hadn't - <em> couldn't have- </em> jumped hard enough. We were going to come down on the spikes and be shredded.</p><p><em> Earth Jutsu?</em> I wondered frantically, trying to dredge up enough chakra to make us a safe landing point. But if I'd had chakra, I would have been fighting.</p><p>And then we landed on sand, hitting awkwardly and rolling.</p><p><em> Sand?</em> I thought bemused, turning to look at the tree line.</p><p>"Everyone is making such dramatic entrances today," I said, dropping my head back down onto the sand.</p><p>A black suited form landed on the sand beside us. "These two don't look good, Gaara," Kankurou called out.</p><p>"You wish you looked as good as me," Kiba grumbled back. "You guys nearly missed the party, you know."</p><p>Two others drifted closer, hovering above the deadly spikes on clouds of sand. "I don't know, I'd say we showed up just in time," Temari said, fan held open and ready.</p><p>I turned back to the fight. Naruto was holding himself above the spikes, huge red claws and tail extending downwards and holding himself safely in the air. Sasuke was… Sasuke was <em> flying.</em> Huge, hand shaped wings extended from his back, beating slowly and letting him hover. It looked awkward though, and I wondered how much mobility he had.</p><p>Sand surged across the ground, filling the cracks between the spikes, homing in on Kimimaro -</p><p>- high in the sky, Sasuke created another Chidori and began to dive -</p><p>- Naruto reached out one giant red chakra claw and grabbed a spike, using it to slingshot himself forward across the ground, a Rasengan blooming in his hand -</p><p>- Kimimaro froze, trapped in the sand, extending the spikes around him to form a protective cage of bone -</p><p>- and Naruto and Sasuke punched right through it, from opposite directions, attacking with eerie synchronism and crushing Kimimaro between them. Chakra flared, bright and powerful, waves of backlash emanating away from the point of the conflict.</p><p>I blinked, white spots dancing painfully in front of my eyes from the sheer intensity of it.</p><p>"Fucking crazy," Kiba breathed.</p><p>I couldn't help but agree.</p><p><hr /></p><p>On Kimimaro's power level - in canon, he defeated hundreds of Kyuubi enhanced shadow clones, and held off Gaara and Lee, tanking at least a sand coffin/burial and being buried however far underground. We know that he can fight all the other Sound Four at once, and that, given the Sasuke vs. Naruto fight, the Level 2 is equivalent to a one tailed state. Yeah, just think about it for a second. If he wasn't dying from a mysterious illness they'd all have been screwed.</p><p>I think Kimimaro was far more interested in allowing Sasuke to get to Sound than in actually fighting. That was his goal, and he knew he had limited time/strength, so as canon Sasuke was heading there himself, he merely drew out the pursuers as long as he could.</p><p>Blah, fight scene done.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sound Four Arc: Chapter 62</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: So according to the counter on this, it's been a year since I started writing. Wow. Back when I started writing this I hardly thought it would get this long, or hold my attention for a full year. I didn't think it would get much beyond ten chapters and now look at it. XD DOS started as an attempt at a 'realistic' Self Insert, like Cage of Blood and Circumstance and Only a Moron, and to world build and expand within the bounds of canon and explain the how's and why's that things happened the way they did. It was never really intended as a 'butterfly effect' fic, and indeed a few people have complained that nothing seems to change. Still, it's grown.</p><p>Anemos - Given that we see different ninja using varying amounts of hand seals for the same technique - from many to few to none - I've always seen the hand seals as a focusing technique more than a absolute requisite. Haku probably mastered the skill of thinking a 'half' seal as the same as the 'full' one, allowing him to use two hands separately, but not the same 'mastery' that let him use a jutsu without seals.</p><p>Just Some Random - I think the little things matter a lot. Most Naruto fanfic focus on the battle part - getting strong enough/tricky enough to win - which is fair enough, but there's also the point that they're people who are <em> living</em> this fulltime and have to gain enough life experience to make good decisions as they go, which for most teams is probably more important than learning jutsu at genin level. Desperate is probably a good word for it, actually. There's a difference between 'I need to get stronger' and 'three years till Pein'…</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 62</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Don't be afraid to give your best to what seemingly are small jobs. Every time you conquer one it makes you that much stronger. If you do the little jobs well, the big ones will tend to take care of themselves. ~Dale Carnegie</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The crash of silence after the fighting stopped was in some ways worse than the fighting itself. Everything was poised with stillness; a brief moment stretched out longer and longer as no one moved.</p><p>I could hear the beat of my pulse, loud in my ears but fast and thready; could hear the dry catch of my throat as I swallowed. I could still see afterimages, flickers of light imprinted on my eyes by the flaring of the chidori, making everything left seem somehow darker.</p><p>"Gaara," Naruto said tersely, "what are you doing here?" It was probably only the Kyuubi chakra that made his voice edge into a threatening snarl, but then again, the last time we had seen the Sand trio we had been enemies. He had landed on the sand, but was crouched and wary, ready to get free if it proved to be a trap.</p><p>"Your Hokage sent us," Temari answered quickly, eyeing him almost uneasily. She was probably remembering how much destruction an angry or out of control Jinchuriki could cause. "She thought you could use some backup. We were bringing a message to Leaf from the Council of Elders when we were asked to take this mission to assist you."</p><p>"Oh," Naruto said, releasing his hold on the Kyuubi's chakra. The red chakra cloak faded away, and the physical changes went away with it.</p><p>Then he tipped over and faceplanted in the sand.</p><p>I spasmed reflexively, sitting up, wanting to check up on him, to help him but not being close enough to actually do anything.</p><p>Sasuke touched down gently beside him, his own enhancements fading away, and rolled him over. "Chakra exhaustion, I think," he said, frowning. Gingerly, he touched the front of Naruto's jacket, where it was ripped and bloody.</p><p>"Moron. Giving everyone a heart attack like that," Kiba groused beside me. He shifted about, trying to find a position that hurt the least. Akamaru whimpered as he was jostled, curling himself into a tiny ball.</p><p>I glanced at Kiba, taking note of how pale and clammy his skin was. "Yeah, well, you know Naruto," I said lightly to hide my worry. The fight might have been over, but that didn't mean things were totally okay.</p><p>The sand platforms drifted gently towards the tree line, taking us towards Lee and Hinata. Naruto's toad summon seemed to have vanished, either because he was unconscious or having run out of chakra.</p><p>"Kiba needs to get back to Konoha ASAP," I said bluntly, as soon as we were in comfortable speaking distance.</p><p>"Don't give me that," Kiba scoffed. "You're injured too. I saw your arm."</p><p>"It's not so bad," I said. Kiba really, <em> really</em> needed medical attention. "I'll last till we get back."</p><p>"How about you let me be the judge of that?" Kankurou asked, crouching down and taking my wrist with a grip that was surprisingly gentle but firm enough to stop the reflexive jerk away I made as he prodded my hand. The bandages on my forearm were wet but not completely soaked through. He frowned as he moved a hand up to my neck to take my pulse but nodded reluctantly. "Alright, I'll give you this one. We'll move faster with just one anyway."</p><p>I recognized the concession for what it was; a delicate balancing act of probabilities, trying to get the best possible outcome for the greatest number of people. He could take both of us; but that would mean travelling slower and reducing the chances of reaching medical attention in time for Kiba. Two of them could go, but that would leave only one with the main group which would put them in danger if there were any further attacks.</p><p>"You take Inuzuka back," Temari suggested. "Gaara and I will stay with the rest of them."</p><p>Kankurou's gaze flickered to Gaara, but he didn't object or make any other suggestions. "Sounds like a plan," he agreed, hopping down onto the bone free ground. He hauled one of Kiba's arms over his shoulder and pulled him up, taking most of the Inuzuka's weight. "Come on, you'll be home free in no time."</p><p>He leapt away in a blur of speed, heading on a direct path back to Konoha.</p><p>"We are most fortunate you arrived when you did," Lee said carefully. I could practically feel the awkward tension in the air but at least he didn't appear to be upset or aggressive. Considering Gaara had nearly ended his ninja career, Lee had a huge capacity for forgiveness.</p><p>"It was our mission," Temari said, shrugging awkwardly and closing her fan. "Speaking of which, what do you want done with her?" she gestured at the red haired girl wrapped up in Gaara's sand. Even if she woke, she wasn't getting far.</p><p><em> Tayuya.</em> I'd nearly forgotten about her. It was lucky she hadn't ended up impaled on the spikes.</p><p>Lee glanced at me and I blinked, realizing that with Kiba gone and Naruto out of it, only Sasuke and I were part of the original mission, and he'd just undergone an unknown and possibly mind-altering procedure. <em> Right. Up to me, then.</em></p><p>"We have to take her back with us," I said. "Capturing them was the whole point of the mission." I hesitated, then decided to push my luck. "Can you seal bodies away?"</p><p>They weren't part of our mission, and I couldn't really <em> make </em> them do it. It depended on how helpful they wanted to be.</p><p>"Yes," Gaara said flatly, the first time he'd spoken.</p><p>Temari looked a little surprised at his intercession, but nodded. "You want to take him as well?" she asked, nodding at Kimimaro.</p><p>I nodded. "There should be a second corpse close by as well. And… remnants of a wooden barrel, if any survived. They have seals on them which might be important."</p><p>Temari nodded dubiously, glancing at the field. "We'll try," was all she said, stepping out onto the sand cloud that had formed once again beside Gaara.</p><p>I nodded in acceptance, and turned back to the others. "Hinata."</p><p>"Naruto is fine," she said softly, deactivating her Byakugan that she'd been using to stare intensely at him. "I mean, as far as I can tell."</p><p>"That's good," I said, a little bit more worry being chased away. "Are you injured?"</p><p>She shook her head mutely.</p><p>"Unless one of the others managed to find her, Ino is still out there alone," I explained. "She was knocked out and I had to leave her behind." I gave as accurate directions as I could to where she had been left. Now that the adrenaline focused clarity of battle was fading, things were becoming muddled. Had we gone north or north east? How far? How much had I doubled back?</p><p>"I will find her," Hinata said reassuringly, looking quietly determined. She was a good choice for this, with her Byakugan and tracking skills, she'd be able to locate Ino even without completely accurate directions.</p><p>"Watch out for the traps," I cautioned as she jumped away. Then I sighed wearily, feeling all the aches and pains accumulated over the mission all at once. Exhaustion settled heavily on my limbs, making my hands fumble as I pulled a pill out of one of the inside pockets of my jacket. However tempting it would have been to take a soldier pill, they reacted badly with injuries, aggravating them horribly, which limited their practical usage quite a lot. This was a Blood Replenishing Pill - containing erythropoietin to stimulate red blood cell formation, large proteins and starches to help regulate blood pressure and artificial oxygen carrying compounds, they were a 'quick fix' pill for shinobi who were injured on missions. However, they didn't solve all the problems, and were more of a stopgap measure than a cure. Then I wiggled my canteen free and dumped a sachet of re-hydrating powder in it, with glucose and sodium for quick uptake and energy, it made a decent fluid replacement.</p><p><em> We'll be alright,</em> I thought, taking a second to let it sink in. <em> We'll be alright now.</em></p><p>The mission had gone from bad to worse to insane, knocking us around at every opportunity, but… we'd made it through.</p><p>"Lee?" I asked softly. "When you got Tayuya… Shikamaru and Chouji…"</p><p>He seemed to understand what I was asking. "Your brother was uninjured. Chouji required medical attention, however, and Shikamaru was having trouble carrying both people. Rather than leave the prisoner unguarded, I volunteered to take her and assist you."</p><p>I slumped a little with relief. It wasn't <em> good</em> that Chouji was hurt, but it could have been so much worse. I had been half-dreading the truth ever since Lee had shown up with her.</p><p><em> They're both alive. Mobile enough to return to Konoha. </em> Anything else… well, we had to get back to Konoha too. Anything else would be dealt with then.</p><p>My attention was dragged back into the present as Temari dropped back down onto the ground, Gaara hovering silently and stoically behind her.</p><p>"We got what we could," she said, tucking a scroll away with brisk efficiency. She didn't look at all bothered by what had to have been an unpleasant job. Kidomaru hadn't been in one piece after Kiba hit him, let alone adding in the damage that Kimimaro's spikes would have done. "There wasn't much that could be retrieved, though."</p><p>"Anything is good," I said. "If they're really bothered they can send someone out to scrape the rest off the ground." Hopefully not us, though. I'd had enough of this place.</p><p>Temari smirked. "Right. Let's go, then."</p><p>I staggered to my feet, fighting to keep my face neutral as my <em> everything</em> protested the movement. I doubted it escaped anyone's attention, but considering that Lee and Sasuke were equally battered and bedraggled, they had no room to comment on it.</p><p>We set a slow limping pace as we headed back, mostly silent. I knew I should have tried to talk to them, or at least to Gaara, and that I might not get another chance for a while, but I could hardly start talking about Akatsuki with so many ears around and the longer I left it, the deeper the silence feel and the harder it was to try and break it. Eventually, everything settled into a tired daze of moving, and it was long gone dark by the time we reached the village gates, probably <em> early</em> rather than <em> late. </em></p><p>I felt completely and utterly exhausted, bone deep and achingly weary. I was out of chakra, having used all my reserves and started drawing on that last vital supply of stamina somewhere along the line, and it made me feel strangely hollow and empty. My muscles trembled with fatigue and pain and too much adrenaline, and for one desperate moment, I just wanted to cry.</p><p>I fought against the feeling of having been pushed <em> too far</em> , against the stinging eyes and tightness of my throat, reminding myself that everyone here had gone through the same. If they could keep on being strong, so could I.</p><p>The gate guards took one look at us and then we were suddenly being whisked away to the hospital. I lost track of the others pretty much immediately, being shuffled around until I ended up in a diagnostics room, sitting on the bed while a nurse cut my jacket and glove away, and another placed a breathing mask over my face.</p><p>"Count backwards from ten," she suggested, as it hissed. I could feel the air circulating, and thought I could <em> taste</em> it, faintly sweet and chemical.</p><p>"Ten," I began obediently, eyes sliding closed, "nine, eight… seven…"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Sound washed over me like the babbling of a river, like a tide coming in and out, present but formless, meaningless. Sleep was a warm weight holding me down and I stirred slowly, groggy with both exhaustion and chemicals.</p><p>Sound became voices and voices became words, familiar but just beyond the reach of understanding.</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>"Hey," Shikamaru said, leaning his elbows on the bed. He had a smudge of mud across his forehead, and what looked like the remnants of shredded leaves in his ponytail. He was still 'fresh off a mission' regardless of how long I'd been out.</p><p>"Hey," I echoed back.</p><p>"How are you feeling?"</p><p>I sorted through the returning stimuli; dull aches and pains, bruises, the barest trickle of chakra, too small to grasp. "Tired," I answered. Most of all, <em> tired.</em></p><p>He nodded and I looked past him, to see who he had been talking too. "Temari," I said, surprised. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>She shrugged lightly, leaning back in her chair and crossing her ankles, all casual elegance. "Gaara wants to talk to Uzumaki when he wakes up," she explained. "And no one's kicked us out yet."</p><p>I nodded, vaguely pleased that they hadn't left yet. I didn't exactly have a <em> plan</em> but having an opportunity was better than none. More importantly, though, Temari mentioning Naruto reminded me that I didn't know what had happened to everyone.</p><p>I levered myself up, leaning against the headboard even as several muscles protested the change in position. "How's Chouji?"</p><p>"He's fine," he said, tangling his fingers with those of my good hand. "He took two of the pills."</p><p>I nodded. I'd hoped otherwise but given the level of opponent it wasn't exactly surprising.</p><p>Shikamaru let out a breath that was halfway between a snort and a sigh. "He was <em> this close</em> to taking the third," he said, voice low, and I half wished that Temari wasn't here to see this. "It was such a mess. I was bringing him home and he just kept losing weight…"</p><p>I squeezed his fingers. I could imagine it, a desperate race back, pushing past the limits of exhaustion, the building horror of <em> too light, too light, I might not be in time…</em></p><p>"But he's okay now?" I asked, gently reminding him.</p><p>"Yeah. Tsunade-sama was here. I gave her unrestricted access to the Nara Medical Encyclopaedia. Dad's not going to be very happy when he gets back." He shrugged, not in the least bit sorry.</p><p>It took me a second to put the disjointed sentences together. Of the Akimichi Three Coloured Pills, only the third was absolutely fatal, but the first two still supercharged the metabolism and could have extremely adverse effects – they <em> could </em> be fatal, they just weren't always. And even if they weren't, there was still the chance for permanent, crippling injury. The clan Medical Encyclopaedia was exactly what it said it was, and had a lot of information on the Pills, including what they were made of and how they worked. That right there was a highly guarded secret, let alone what <em> else</em> was in the book. Shikamaru was the heir, and with Dad away, technically he <em> did</em> have the right to give access to it… but that didn't mean it was <em> done.</em></p><p>"I think he'll understand," I said. If it saved Chouji's life… he'd understand.</p><p>"Yeah, so. Kiba got out of surgery about the same time you went in," Shikamaru continued, almost changing the subject. "Naruto is just down with chakra exhaustion and they took Sasuke to the secure wing, but I don't think he was hurt. Lee got told off for leaving, but he's fine. Neji wasn't hurt, but he and Tenten stopped by for a while. Same with Hinata."</p><p>Which left one glaring exception. "And Ino?"</p><p>His eyes dropped. "She hasn't woken up."</p><p>My heart sank. I remembered the half whispered mantra, the empty gaze. I'd just <em> left her there. </em> If she'd gone catatonic… if it was my fault…</p><p>"I see," I managed.</p><p>"The doctors are hoping you can give them more information about what she was hit with."</p><p>I nodded mutely, the statement hitting like a blow. Not only had they been unable to help her, <em> they didn't even know what was wrong. </em></p><p>"She'll be alright though, right?" Shikamaru asked, raising his eyes to mine.</p><p>"Yeah," I said huskily, trying to swallow the lump in my throat. "It's Ino. She won't let something like this keep her down." Because even if Shikamaru would be the first person to call Ino troublesome, they were teammates and close friends besides; I couldn't look him in the eye and say 'I don't know'.</p><p>And I didn't know. I trusted the medics here, trusted Tsunade, but <em> I didn't know.</em> I had no fall back, no safety net of information telling me that this would be okay. I'd always known, intellectually, that things were changing, that I needed to work with information gathered in the present, but it had still been there, narrowing the outcomes, helping me anticipate things. I'd expected the sand siblings to come – doubted it, in the face of danger, but expected all the same – but not Hinata. I hadn't expected Ino to get hurt.</p><p>I didn't know if she'd get better.</p><p>It scared me.</p><p><em> Be okay, Ino. Please be okay.</em></p><p>I <em> had</em> considered that using Mind-Body Switch on him was a bad idea. I <em> had. Why </em> hadn'tI-?</p><p>"It's not your fault," Shikamaru said, cutting through my thoughts.</p><p>"You don't even know what happened," I quipped back, tiredly.</p><p>"Yeah. But I know you. And I know Ino." His eyes were steady, exhausted but steady.</p><p>Temari snorted, shifting in her chair and drawing attention back to herself. "Didn't any of you receive emotional training? Or is that too brutal for Hidden Leaf?"</p><p>I wanted to sink back, to let Shikamaru handle it. I didn't <em> want</em> to argue with her. But there was an evaluating look in her eye that tugged at me and I mustered the energy to play this game.</p><p>"Sure, we did," I replied, mostly calmly. "People get hurt on missions, that much is true… we just prefer it when those people aren't <em> us.</em> " Words within words; don't mistake caring for weakness, we can fight when we need to. It wasn't exactly a hostile exchange, more… testing; probing and deflecting, like the first feints of battle to see where we each stood.</p><p>My smile might have been a tad sharp at the edges, an unspoken reminder that she'd been on the opposite side of the fight from us once, and hadn't come off the better for it. That probably had a lot to do with it, actually.</p><p>"And when it is?" she asked coolly.</p><p>I gestured at myself wordlessly. <em> See for yourself.</em></p><p>She gave a low 'hmph' of acknowledgement before standing. "I'm going to go get something to eat," she said. "Maybe make sure Kankurou hasn't gotten into trouble."</p><p>I gave her a commiserating smile. "Brothers. They take so much looking after."</p><p>"I'm not the one in a hospital bed, <em> sister,</em> " Shikamaru said dryly.</p><p>I laughed, listening to the fading footsteps as she walked down the hall. "Speaking of. Have you slept?"</p><p>"What do you think?" he asked, drolly. Yeah, I could see his point. Both team mates and a sister in hospital – surgery for two of us – and it wouldn't have been on my list of priorities either. Still, light was pouring into the room, which meant early to mid-morning, and we'd only managed a few hours sleep between planning the mission and moving out.</p><p>"I think you probably should," I said pragmatically.</p><p>"Trying to get rid of me already?" Shikamaru asked a little archly. "You only just woke up."</p><p>"Hardly," I said. "I'm glad you're here." And I was; visual confirmation that he was okay. "You just look tired, that's all."</p><p>"I can't. Just… not yet." He rubbed his face tiredly. "Not till everyone…"</p><p><em> Not till everyone wakes up.</em></p><p>That could be a long time, but for now it wasn't worth pushing. "Sorry," I said. "Talk to me?"</p><p>He shrugged half-heartedly and looked away and I thought he wasn't going to answer, but after a minute he spoke. "We weren't ready. Not for fighting like that." It was a bland statement, but there was a hint of bitterness hiding behind it.</p><p>I felt a pang of guilt, because I had been <em> so confident.</em> Thought that because it <em> had</em> happened, we would be fine. Arguably it had gone well; we'd succeeded, no one was dead… but that was cold comfort. I didn't like to take risks, and it occurred to me that this was a <em> massive </em> one.</p><p>"If they hadn't had the second state… it would have been fine," I said. "The ambush went… almost perfectly."</p><p>"Yeah. That's why I can't be too angry at them," Shikamaru agreed. "I still think Genin shouldn't have been sent on a mission like this… but it wasn't intentional." He snorted suddenly. "That's what all your missions have been like, haven't they?"</p><p>"Kinda, yeah. It never <em> starts out</em> as 'go fight these Jounin-level ninja' or anything… but this one seemed a lot worse." Maybe because we got injured, maybe simply because it was the most recent.</p><p>"Joy," he said sarcastically. "And if I tell you I feel guilty that Chouji got hurt, what are you going to say?"</p><p>"I don't know, what did you say ten minutes ago about me and Ino?" I asked dryly.</p><p>"That's what I thought," he said.</p><p>"What a pair we are," I sighed.</p><p>We were silent for a bit, not really eager to go digging through the mess that had resulted from this mission. I still didn't know what exactly had happened, but everyone was okay and there would be a debriefing later. Later was fine.</p><p>I'd nearly fallen back asleep, eyelids too heavy to keep open, when someone rapped, brisk and efficient, on the door before stepping inside.</p><p>"Oh, good," Tsunade said. "You are awake." She lifted the clipboard from the end of the bed and checked several things off, then set a hand on my arm. I shivered a little at her chakra sinking below the skin. "Reconstruction of blood vessels appears to be holding; no weakening of the walls or leakages. Muscle lacerations are healing nicely, too." She nodded a little in approval. "The hand is much trickier. There are a lot of small moving parts that need to be taken care of. We'll be watching closely for infections and you'll be in physiotherapy for that for the next week or two for the very least."</p><p>"Yes, Tsunade-sama," I said obediently.</p><p>She scribbled several more comments onto the patient record, then slipped it back into its holder. Looking at her, you couldn't tell that she'd probably been awake and conducting surgery all night; she looked as settled and composed as normal. "Now, what can you tell me about the attack that Ino Yamanaka was hit with?"</p><p>I cleared my throat nervously. "It wasn't an attack," I rasped. "Ino used her Mind-Body Switch on Kidomaru when he was in the second state of the curse seal. It didn't… it didn't <em> work.</em> " I looked down. Shikamaru's hand tightened on mine. "We thought that the … psychological aspects of the seal might make it dangerous, but it was still the best option we had."</p><p>I chanced a glance upwards at her face, and something in me relaxed, just a little. There was a little surprise, but no judgement.</p><p>"I pinned him down, and she definitely <em> hit</em> her target," I continued. "It stunned him for maybe a second or two, but she never established any control over him, and he didn't appear significantly impaired. After, I don't know, a few minutes, maybe," the words tumbled out of my mouth artlessly. It had seemed so <em> fast</em> and so <em> long</em> at the same time. I couldn't tell how long it had really taken. "her chakra returned to her body and she spoke but she seemed neither conscious nor aware of her surroundings."</p><p>"I see," Tsunade said thoughtfully. "Well that changes things, doesn't it." And it did, because if you were testing for physical reasons and there were none…</p><p>I hoped desperately that Tsunade might be able to <em> fix</em> her.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Yeah, it took a while to get this update out. I can't promise that the next one is going to be any faster, either. Sorry.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sound Four Arc: Chapter 63</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Author's note: I've recently started a new job, so my writing time has decreased a fair bit. Things may speed back up when I get into a routine, but for now things are a bit hectic.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 63</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> How do you feel? That is the question </em></p><p><em> But I forget you don't expect an easy answer ~ Stone Sour</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Later, after Mum had come to scold me for getting injured – again! – and dragged Shikamaru home with a flurry of nagging 'suggestions', I mustered up the energy to move and padded slowly down the hospital corridors. There was no way to move that didn't hurt, everything stressed, strained, overworked and cramped and I thought longingly of going back to sleep until I had recovered enough chakra to alleviate some of it, but my sense of time was nagging at me. I knew if I left it too long – procrastinated – then I would miss my chance, and I couldn't risk that.</p><p>Gingerly, I pushed the door to the roof open, blinking and squinting at the bright sunlight. The rooftop was mostly covered in clotheslines, hanging the masses of white sheets that the hospital went through out to dry. It gave the place an almost eerie maze like quality.</p><p>I hesitated for a second in the open door, wanting to turn around and retreat, then pushed myself forward. My palms started to sweat and I rubbed them on the legs of my pants; I was hardly in any condition to fight, would hardly even be able to <em> run</em> , and for all that the Sand Siblings had rescued us, not too long ago they had been our enemies.</p><p><em> You wanted to talk to him,</em> I reminded myself.</p><p>I wound my way through the maze of flapping white sheets, heading unerringly for the edge of the building and the person I knew was there. My chakra sense was a <em> sense</em> , like sight, like hearing, it was absolutely passive and didn't require me to expend any chakra, for which I was grateful. I had no chakra to spare, right now, and being without it would be like being blind.</p><p>I cleared my throat awkwardly, as I approached. "Hi."</p><p>Gaara turned to look at me. There was none of the bloodlust, the untamed killer intent, that there had been last time he was in Konoha and I relaxed a fraction. There was a difference between <em> expecting</em> something – based on information that might not even be relevant anymore, even – and seeing.</p><p>"I, ah, I wanted to thank you for helping us."</p><p>Gaara blinked and looked – mildly – baffled. "You came up here to say… thank you?"</p><p>I might not have ever been <em> brilliant </em> at small talk, but it wasn't strange was it? There was a reason I'd chosen it as my segue into conversation. Start a conversation, get it rolling, then drop the bomb about Akatsuki…</p><p>"Well, I came up here to get some fresh air, but when I saw you I thought I should say thanks," I said, which wasn't entirely the truth but, you know, made me seem less like a weird stalker.</p><p>Somehow I had the feeling that this conversation wasn't going to go in the direction I envisioned it.</p><p>"It was a pretty nasty mission," I continued, as the silence drew out. "We were lucky you showed up when you did."</p><p>Actually, by the time the Sand Siblings had shown up, Naruto and Sasuke probably had things under control. <em> Probably.</em> Although, they'd definitely helped in getting us all home in one piece.</p><p>I sighed, leaning on the railing at the edge of the roof and arranging my arm so it dangled in the least painful way. This wasn't working. Maybe I should skip the lead in and go straight to the warning about Akatsuki. I cast my senses out, but I couldn't feel anyone else around. That didn't mean no one was there, however. This was Konoha, the chances of being overheard were <em> so much</em> higher… but if Tsunade didn't have the manpower to send with us, she hardly had the manpower to have people watch the Sand Siblings while they were in the village. Right?</p><p>I chewed on my lip.</p><p>"You were injured on this mission," Gaara said, breaking the silence.</p><p>I almost started. "Yeah," I said, twitching my bandaged arm at him. He was looking almost directly at it, so it was hardly necessary. "Got stabbed trying to pin an explosive tag on him. It was pretty stupid," I said. "But it was after Kiba went down and before Hinata showed up, so I didn't have a lot of choice."</p><p><em> That</em> seemed to interest him. Oh yeah. This was one of Gaara's <em> things,</em> wasn't it? The bonds between people, friendship, altruism.</p><p>"You were injured trying to protect him," he said lowly. "Why? Doesn't it hurt?"</p><p>I stared thoughtfully at my arm, wiggled my fingers and, like an idiot, poked it. "Yup," I hissed between gritted teeth. Okay, so that was not as healed as I thought it was. "But if I hadn't done anything… it would have been worse, because other people would have gotten hurt."</p><p>Maybe Kimimaro would have left Kiba and I alone, he hadn't been interested in us at all, but Sasuke would have been delivered straight to Orochimaru. That… no, I couldn't have let that happen.</p><p>"You would… feel their pain."</p><p>I blinked. "I guess? Not literally but … it would have hurt. It does hurt," I amended. It sounded terribly lame; <em> hurt</em> didn't even begin to cover it. Fear, guilt, anguish, the twisting, sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, the lump in your throat…</p><p>I swallowed. Gaara was watching me, gaze steady and disconcerting.</p><p>"It's worse," I finished.</p><p>"A wound of the heart," he murmured. "When you care about someone so much that every hurt inflicted on them is inflicted on you as well. And the closer they are, the more it hurts."</p><p>I had a feeling he wasn't even really talking to me anymore. It was a little worrying. And I couldn't let that kind of bleak assessment pass without comment. "There are a lot of good things about having people that close too, though." My mouth twisted a little. "It's not just pain."</p><p>"And even that pain is preferable to loneliness," Gaara mused.</p><p>"Yeah, because loneliness like that… is there all the time." Like waking up and remembering <em> they're gone, they're gone, it's all gone.</em> I shoved the thought away, annoyed with myself. "Look Gaara… I know we didn't start off on the right foot or anything… but Konoha and Hidden Sand are allies now – <em> we</em> are allies now." I fumbled the words. This wasn't going right. Nothing I'd planned to say fit, and everything was moving too fast to take the time to plot out a speech. "And I know that you're a Jinchuriki. So I wanted to warn you. There is a group called Akatsuki, made up of S-rank missing-nin, that is hunting you. One of them is Sasori of Red Sand…"</p><p>That was so very far from smooth. I grimaced. "I don't think I'm really supposed to be telling you this, but I thought you should know."</p><p>Gaara was staring at me, eyes wide – not crazy-wide, thankfully – and I looked away. "They're after Naruto too, that's how I know."</p><p>Was that enough information? Was it too much? How could I even tell? Mentioning Sasori was important, he was <em> from</em> Sand, they probably had the most information on him…</p><p>My head ached. I wanted to go lie down. Maybe I should have left this till later.</p><p>"You would," Gaara rasped, "feel pain… for me?"</p><p>My brain stalled, running back over our conversation and trying to find the links. <em> Oh, hell.</em> "I don't think anyone should get hurt," I said. "It doesn't… It shouldn't have to be like that."</p><p>And oh, wasn't that something strange? I came from a world where everything that hurt people was <em> bad.</em> Everything was regulated, everything dangerous was minimised, even prisoners were kept safe and unharmed. There was no – or very little – 'they deserved it'. Here, it was different. Sometimes it was close enough that I missed the cultural difference, but sometimes it was so obvious. I'd learnt to live with it, it had crept into my thought processes until I barely even noticed, but sometimes… sometimes I felt so <em> other.</em></p><p>"Is that why you let us leave?" Gaara accused, suddenly, eyes narrowing.</p><p>I sighed. "I killed thirteen people between the stadium and finding you in the forest," I said, tiredly. I hated saying it, hated knowing the total number was even higher than that. "I didn't let you go because I wanted to keep my hands clean." That was what he was asking – did you because you <em> couldn't?</em> "I made a <em> choice, </em> Gaara. I thought it would be <em> better.</em> It was, wasn't it? You wouldn't have come to help us now if things had been different then."</p><p>The look of accusation had faded, but I couldn't tell if he got it. I pushed myself off the rail. "Look, I'm tired. Just… think about it. And you probably shouldn't let anyone know I told you." I grimaced again; it gave him something to hold over me, but it couldn't be helped.</p><p>I walked away, the back of my neck prickling as I turned my back on him.</p><p><em> That could have gone better.</em></p><p>I limped down the stairs and fully intended on going back to my room and sleeping, but I passed by a room with familiar chakra inside and couldn't resist the urge to go in.</p><p>Kiba looked up as the door opened. "Yo. Man, you're up already? They won't even let me get out of bed." He scoffed in good natured disgust.</p><p>I stepped around the small dog bed on the floor, where Akamaru was bandaged and curled up, and settled into the visitors chair. "Only just," I muttered with a yawn. "I feel like I could sleep for a week. How's Akamaru?"</p><p>"What not going to ask how <em> I</em> am?"</p><p>"You're awake and complaining," I shot back dryly. "Sounds like you're just fine to me."</p><p>Kiba smirked. "Yeah, whatever. He's fine. Hana was here, she checked him out. Said we were both lucky to not be worse off." The smirk left his face.</p><p>"Most of us were lucky," I said sombrely.</p><p>"Yeah. Most of us were," he echoed. "Though I tell you what, Mum's going to kick my ass in training for letting this happen. Not cool, and I thought flunking the Chunin Exams was bad enough…"</p><p>"Mmm," I agreed, eyes sliding closed. These chairs weren't actually that uncomfortable after all…</p><p><hr /></p><p>I woke to a very familiar chakra presence brushing my senses.</p><p>"Sensei?" I murmured sleepily. "Aren't you supposed to be at the border?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei was leaning casually against the door frame, hands in his pockets. He looked absolutely normal, but he didn't have his book out, and there was something indefinable about him that read as weary.</p><p>"Sa, they sent the first responders home," he said. "I got to come back with a team of Chunin that had been in Land of Stone for the past month."</p><p>I nodded, covering a yawn and rubbing the crust from my eyes. It made sense, to relieve the ones that had already <em> been</em> on a mission when they'd been called out, especially if it had been a long one. That didn't really explain sensei, but I was just <em> glad</em> he was there.</p><p>"Have you seen the boys?" I asked, hopefully.</p><p>His eye curved into a smile. "Not yet. I was just on my way there." The invitation was pretty implicit and I unravelled myself out of the chair. If I'd felt terrible before, it was nothing compared to how I felt after several hours sitting in the same position. My stomach gave an angry growl, reminding me that sometime during my nap, lunch had passed.</p><p>"And maybe some food," I said, slightly embarrassed.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei cocked his head thoughtfully, and reached into one of the pockets of his vest. The ration bar he withdrew was slightly crushed and battered enough that the lettering was starting to fade off the packaging – and really, who ate ration bars when they didn't have to? – but I took it with a slightly bemused, slightly fond smile. "Thanks sensei."</p><p>Kiba coughed, a little awkwardly. "Ne, Kakashi-sensei. Didja see Kurenai-sensei while you were there?"</p><p>"No," Kakashi-sensei replied. "But I did see some of her genjutsu work. She's doing well."</p><p>Which made me curious as to what he was talking about, but it was overruled by more pressing matters. I <em> did</em> want to know about what was happening at the border, but it could wait.</p><p>"I think Sasuke's in the secure ward, again," I said, leaning into Kakashi-sensei's side, half for support, half just for a hug.</p><p>He ruffled my hair awkwardly. "They're looking at the changes in the seal," he said. "It's a complicated process."</p><p>I'd never actually been to the secure ward, and Kakashi-sensei led me – slowly – down the stairs and through a series of twisting corridors that made me doubt we were even still <em> in</em> the hospital anymore. The secure ward was for things that were dangerous or <em> in</em> danger, so I guess it made sense not to have it near the other patients. There was a single ANBU standing guard by the door as we signed into the 'visitors' log under Kakashi-sensei's clearance. I suspected – but had no proof – that there was at least one more for backup somewhere nearby.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei took us to an observation room, overlooking a giant, sealing room, empty save for Sasuke in the centre and Jiraiya and several scribes around the edges. The floor was painted with incredibly intricate patterns of black ink, coiling up Sasuke's body until they reached his neck and then… illuminating. I couldn't think of any other way to describe it. It reminded me of the OHP's – overhead projectors – that had been common when I'd been at primary school, using a light source and lenses to magnify writing onto another surface. In this case, the roof was showing a wavering, and in some cases blurred, projection of a seal.</p><p>It was fascinating. The air fairly thrummed with chakra.</p><p>Sasuke's eye flickered towards the observation window as we came in.</p><p>"Don't move!" Jiraiya barked. There was a crease of concentration between his eyes.</p><p>"That's… the curse mark?" I asked, squinting at it.</p><p>"The expanded form, yes," Kakashi-sensei said. I watched as he nonchalantly pushed his headband up and stared at it with his Sharingan eye. "The process to even view it is quite complicated."</p><p>I could see that, just from the sheer size of the room involved. It also gave me an idea of how complicated the curse seal really was… it covered the entire roof, and I thought some of the blurry spots might have been compacted seals <em> inside</em> the seal.</p><p>"The image is reversed… but that's just part of this process, isn't it?" It made understanding some of the parts a little trickier, but it was a minor inconvenience at best. My eyes flickered over the seal, applying what minor sealing knowledge I had. "Circular sealing… Kanji based… Scientific and mathematical calculations common in medical sealing… tri-part… Chakra sealing? Mind/Soul and Body and … Nature?" I squinted at the Kanji. Those three were compressed again, right in the centre of the image. "That's a … storage seal… for…" I hesitated. "A spirit? A soul? The chakra goes <em> through</em> it, so whatever it is, it's probably what was described as 'consuming' and what gives it the <em> taint.</em> " And what let Orochimaru use it for his body jumping technique. "It has a one-way isolation seal on it… it might actually be able to get <em> out.</em> " I think I sounded a little horrified. Then again, I'd almost known that, what with Kajika's possession on one of our earlier missions and in canon, the snakes that had burst from Sasuke's seal…</p><p>"Jiraiya is the best there is at this," Kakashi-sensei said. It was scant reassurance, since no one had ever been able to do anything about Anko's seal.</p><p>Staring at the seal, I had to admit that I would have no idea where to start unravelling it, either. Orochimaru might have been completely without ethics or morals, but he was a genius.</p><p>It took about an hour for them to finish up, the seal on the ceiling wavering and bits expanding and contracting as they focused on different parts, and it was slow going so clearly they'd been at it for a while before we showed up. I did, in fact, end up eating Kakashi-sensei's ration bar.</p><p>I wished I had paper and a pen to write notes with but somehow I suspected I technically wasn't supposed to be seeing this. Or at least, not in enough depth to understand it.</p><p>Eventually, the sealing stopped, the ink crawling back down off Sasuke and returning to inert lines on the floor.</p><p>"Finally," Sasuke sighed, slumping a little.</p><p>"Don't smudge the ink, kid," Jiraiya said. "You know how long it'll take me to redo all that?"</p><p>"<em> Yes</em> ," Sasuke said, annoyance staining the word. "I was here the whole time. Not moving."</p><p>It was nice to see they were getting on <em> so well.</em></p><p>Sasuke picked his way – carefully! – out of the sealing diagram and headed towards the door.</p><p>"Hey," he said, dark eyes flickering over me. "You're okay? They haven't really told me much of anything." He shrugged, irritated.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm fine," I said. "Kiba and Chouji had surgery, but they're expected to recover. The only one we're worried about… is Ino."</p><p>His eyes widened a little at that. That hadn't been who he was expecting. "I see."</p><p>"And you?" I asked, a little anxious. Obviously he wasn't <em> hurt</em> but…</p><p>Sasuke shrugged again. "They've run so many tests I think they have half my blood right now. And well," he flicked a hand back at the sealing room. "That." He looked quite bored with it all, which was probably a reaction to not having been able to move for hours on end.</p><p>"Really, Kakashi?" Jiraiya said, holding one of the recently written scrolls. "You think it's a good idea to bring her here?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei shrugged lackadaisically. "I can vouch for her."</p><p>"Not really what I meant," Jiraiya said, rolling his eyes. He didn't seem that perturbed or surprised, though. "So what'd you think?" That seemed to be directed at me, and though his voice was light, his stare was calculating.</p><p>It was a test. Of course it was a test, but what was it testing?</p><p>"I think," I said slowly. "I would have no idea where to start unravelling a seal like that." I racked my brains for what he could be looking for. I <em> wanted</em> to impress Jiraiya, if I really thought about it, especially when it came to sealing. He had helped me, and I didn't want him to think it had gone to waste. "The compressed seal is always a tri-part seal. Not just Sasuke's, all the other Sound ninja had a three part design as well, even if it was different otherwise. That's because of the chakra storage part, isn't it? Mind, Body, and that third kanji 'nature'… when Sasuke was in the barrel, and when Kidomaru was recovering, it was like they were sucking the chakra out of the air… that's how it manages to provide such a huge strength boost." That was the bloodlimit of Juugo, wasn't it? An uncontrolled sage mode type thing that Orochimaru had studied to make the second state. "And, we saw Orochimaru possess Kajika… that's what the 'soul' component is there for, isn't it? And the more you use the seal, the stronger it gets?"</p><p>Jiraiya looked… I wasn't sure, suddenly.</p><p>"Go back to that part about the chakra in the air," he said slowly, and I realised, suddenly, that I had just described natural chakra to Jiraiya. The Toad Sage.</p><p><em> Sometimes you should just learn to keep your mouth shut,</em> I thought to myself. Which was strange, since my natural inclination <em> was</em> to keep my mouth shut.</p><p>"Umm," I said intelligently. "It's just sort of there? Everything gives off chakra just from being alive." I fumbled the words. It was… It wasn't easy to describe and it wasn't a conversation topic that I had anticipated.</p><p>Jiraiya looked pained. Definitely pained. "You haven't tried to … use this … chakra in the air, have you?"</p><p>I shook my head. "It's not <em> mine,</em> " I said. "I don't – maybe calling it chakra is the wrong thing." It was <em> like</em> chakra more than it was like physical or mental energy but it still wasn't…</p><p>"It's called natural energy," Jiraiya said. "And you <em> shouldn't</em> be able to sense it. Dammit, this is not something Genin should be messing with." He gave an exasperated glance at sensei, as though it were his fault. "<em> Don't</em> try and use it without training." His face was unusually serious and I nodded silently. Naruto's sage training had been dangerous, I remembered that much. "I'm not kidding here, natural energy can do worse than kill you – and it can do <em> that</em> too. That's part of the reason we're not doing more than try to contain that curse seal; it's balanced right now but the slightest push will send it crashing down."</p><p>Beside me, Sasuke had gone still and pale. "What," he asked, "is natural energy?" His eyes darted from me to Jiraiya and back again.</p><p>Jiraiya lifted his lips in a humourless smirk. "Exactly what it sounds like. The energy produced by nature as it goes about its daily business of surviving. Sometimes, after <em> many, many</em> years of study, people can learn to sense and manipulate it to become a Sage. Monks, usually, who spend decades meditating daily and pondering the sound of one hand clapping."</p><p>"You're one, though, aren't you?" I asked. "The Toad Sage."</p><p>"That's even rarer. Some Summon animals have the ability to teach… if they think you're worthy. The Toads won't take another Summoner though, not for your generation." He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Some of the other Great Summons might. Tsunade-hime might know if the slugs…" he trailed off. "But the chances of finding a summon that <em> does</em> know, and having them <em> agree</em> to teach you… you might have better luck trying at the Fire Temple. Most temples have some unique sealing techniques, so I'd recommend visiting them anyway."</p><p>That was… more information that I had expected I would get. Not just theoretical, but real world applicable. These people know. Suddenly… it seemed more than 'one day it might be possible'.</p><p>Something must have shown on my face because Sasuke spoke. "Shikako, don't," he said, with something close to urgency in his voice.</p><p>"It's okay," I said quickly. "I understand that you need a teacher. I've already had one close call, you know. I'm not looking for another."</p><p>"And it didn't stop you," Sasuke said flatly. "You still kept training."</p><p>I blinked. Well what had he expected me to do? Stop? That hardly seemed like something Sasuke would consider.</p><p>He looked exasperated. "It's like you don't even see the danger."</p><p>"Of course I do," I said back, puzzled. "Given what we just went through, I'm <em> very</em> aware of how dangerous everything is." And it was only going to get worse, which was why I <em> was</em> looking at high level training, even if I wasn't able to take advantage of the opportunities it presented yet.</p><p>Above our heads, Jiraiya and Kakashi-sensei were exchanging looks, seeming to have an entire conversation.</p><p>"Right," Jiraiya said. "I can't keep Tsunade-hime waiting." He shook his head with a sigh. "You kids do seem to land yourselves right in the middle of some serious messes."</p><p>"You don't know half of it," Kakashi-sensei said with a sigh. "I've been gone for a week and come back to find they've done an A-rank without me."</p><p>Any other time, I would have been all over that opening, but I found I just didn't have the will for mischief right now.</p><p>But Sasuke smirked. "Three," he said. "Technically, we did three A-ranks without you."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei stared.</p><p>"One of them started about… half an hour after you left," Sasuke added.</p><p>"Stop talking," Sensei instructed. "Just… stop."</p><p>A grin tugged at the corner of my mouth. <em> Team Trouble Magnet, alright.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The next day I was wandering again - still tired, still exhausted, but restless – making my way from room to room. Ino wasn't allowed visitors and I worried, but Chouji seemed to be in good spirits and Lee had been resigned to the scolding of the nurses.</p><p>I hadn't visited them in any particular order, simply meandering around and talking to whoever I found first. I also hadn't exactly been paying one hundred percent attention to where I was going, which lead to me nearly walking straight into Neji Hyuuga as he exited the room I was about to enter.</p><p>"Sorry," I said awkwardly. <em> Well, that's a little embarrassing, isn't it?</em></p><p>He shook it off. "Hokage-sama has sent me to inform you that we will be debriefing in an hour in conference room seven, now that everyone is awake."</p><p>I nodded, accepting the information, then paused. "Everyone? Is Ino awake?" I hoped so.</p><p>"I have no more information than that," he said evenly though I thought I might have detected a hint of apology in his tone.</p><p>"Thank you," I said, moving to the side so he could get past.</p><p>But Neji paused. "I have heard," he started carefully. "That Hinata-sama was one of those that assisted you." It wasn't exactly a question, but his gaze was very intense as it settled on me.</p><p>I nodded. "She did. She was brilliant," I said. I meant it, too. "If it hadn't been for her arrival, both Kiba and I would be dead and Sasuke would be gone."</p><p>"Hiashi-sama was… not pleased at her impulsive actions," Neji ventured flatly.</p><p>"He should be," I said, a tad sharply. "She fought Kimimaro one on one and was barely injured where the rest of us nearly died. She was <em> brilliant.</em> "</p><p>Neji just nodded thoughtfully, and it occurred to me that he hadn't mentioned it was his <em> own </em> opinion. Truthfully, I hadn't really had much to do with Neji, even if my team mates had, and most of that had been at the Chunin Exams anyway. While it hadn't been that long ago, Neji had had some major life changes.</p><p>Neji hesitated for a second longer, then moved off with a clipped farewell. I watched him go, thoughtfully, then slipped into the room that he'd just exited.</p><p>"Hey, Naruto," I said.</p><p>"Shikako-chan! Man, you're up already?" Naruto practically wiggled in place. He was wrapped in so many bandages I was surprised he could <em> bend.</em> "Baa-chan said she'd kick my ass if I even thought about it."</p><p>"Sa, you got hurt a lot worse than I did," I said. "And you pulled on a lot more chakra than you have before."</p><p>Naruto's grin faltered a bit. "Yeah, that was a bit… yeah."</p><p><em> Okay, wrong topic.</em> "I've been to see Sasuke," I offered. "He's fine. Jiraiya-sama was looking at the seal."</p><p>"Yeah, the pervy sage was in here before, complaining about baa-chan overworking him." He made a 'pffft' sound, clearly not very impressed by it. And Kaka-sensei was back too!"</p><p>I settled into the chair, chatting away. Nothing kept Naruto down for long.</p><p>About three quarters of an hour later, a nurse came in to help Naruto into a wheelchair and escorted us to the conference room. Kiba and Chouji in wheelchairs as well and it struck me again at how very <em> thin</em> Chouji was, and how wrong it looked on him. The others drifted in, Hinata and Neji together looking reasonably at ease with each other, Shikamaru slouching into a seat next to his team mate with a muted yawn, Ibiki-taicho bandaged and moving stiffly. Sasuke was escorted in by Jiraiya, who grinned and ruffled his hair, earning himself a lethal looking glare.</p><p>"I want out of here," Sasuke said flatly, sliding in between the two of us. The room was starting to get crowded, and we were pressed knee to knee.</p><p>"Jiraiya-sama isn't that bad," I said, carefully smothering my amusement. Naruto didn't even bother and snickered loudly.</p><p>"He's just as bad as Naruto." Sasuke scowled, disgruntled. And where, with Naruto, he could at least retaliate, Jiraiya had both rank and experience against him.</p><p>The rest of the squads trickled in until Tsunade hustled in, followed shortly by Ino and her father.</p><p>I couldn't stop myself hissing a breath, and I wasn't the only one.</p><p>It was relieving to see Ino awake and aware and on her feet, yes… but as she lifted her eyes to scan the room I saw she wasn't unchanged. In the middle of each of her beautiful blue eyes was a long, slitted pupil.</p><p><em> The eyes are the windows to the soul.</em></p><p>It's a sentiment that's repeated often. Doujutsu have an almost legendary status, and more power than their complexity would suggest but it doesn't stop there. Even when the eyes are not the focal point for a change, they can still reflect differences. Sage mode, as an example I had recently been considering, did the exact same thing.</p><p>Which meant that there was something really wrong here.</p><p>Inoichi rested a reassuring hand on her shoulder and guided her to a seat.</p><p>"Alright," Tsunade said, silencing any whispers that had been about to start up. "Sorry to pull you away, Inoichi, but I want to get this wrapped up as soon as possible. First off, congratulations on mission success and zero fatalities." Her eyes swept over us all. "You went above and beyond the expectations of your rank, and I am very proud to call you all ninja of Konoha."</p><p>I could almost see everyone straightening their backs at her words.</p><p>"Secondly, we'll be running a full debriefing. That means we'll be covering details that are classified to the back of beyond and are <em> not</em> to become public knowledge. Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to cover the entire mission, and I imagine most of the village is already aware that <em> something</em> went down." Given that we'd had several groups come bursting through the front gate in various states of injury, as well as prisoners, it wasn't too much of a stretch to say that. <em> What</em> they knew was the important part.</p><p>Ibiki started the recap of the mission beginning, how we'd started and what we'd planned to do, and took it all the way up to when we'd left the village.</p><p>Then it was Sasuke's turn and he got to lay out exactly where the Sound Four had been and where they'd headed, information which brought dark casts to the faces of the adults in the room.</p><p>"Then they made me take the pill, and I don't remember anything until the fighting," he finished flatly.</p><p>"According to the medical reports," Tsunade said, shuffling some of the papers. "That was an enzyme that catalysed a full body change which requires an enormous amount of chakra to initiate. By rights, altering the body that much <em> should</em> have killed you and we're still in the process of working out <em> what exactly</em> was changed."</p><p>Ibiki took over again, continuing to the failed ambush. "They were able to overpower my summoning," he said with a grimace. "I wouldn't be confident in anything short of complete immobilisation and chakra deprivation or suppression being used to incarcerate them."</p><p>Tsunade nodded at his recommendation. "Jiraiya had already applied seals to the prisoners. We don't want them to escape."</p><p>We covered the ambush and splitting up, and Naruto sending Ibiki back to Konoha with a clone. Then we paused, unsure who should go next.</p><p>"Let's start with Team Three," Tsunade said. "Since that's where everyone ended up."</p><p>I swallowed at being so suddenly put on the spot. "Uh, Ino and I went after Kidomaru; the shinobi with six arms. He had sticky webs with high tensile strength as well as ranged projectiles." I struggled to describe the fight concisely. "I was able to pin him down and line him up for Ino to take a shot at him, but…"</p><p>"I was…" Ino said hesitantly, frowning as she tried to put words to something that couldn't really be described. "… diverted. Instead of finding Kidomaru, there was… a snake. A white snake. It attacked me and I couldn't… I was…"</p><p>Her father squeezed her shoulder. "Take it slowly; it's okay."</p><p>"I was injured," she said precisely. <em> Injured </em> could mean a whole lot of things, and I had a sinking feeling as I tried to contemplate the kind of <em> injured</em> that could come from that. "I tried to pull back, but we got… tangled up. Kidomaru too – he was still there it just wasn't him…." Her hands clenched into fists in her lap. "I brought some of it back with me. Dad… The Intelligence Division has been helping me go through it."</p><p><em> Information goldmine,</em> I thought and then was immediately ashamed of myself when it was so clear that Ino was not okay.</p><p>"According to Ino's testimony, as well as the analysis provided by Jiraiya on the seals themselves," Tsunade said. "We have reason to believe that each curse seal possesses a fragment of mental and spiritual energy. Enough to potentially sustain a personality template and gather and retain information. Without a substantial boost, it wouldn't be able to completely possess anyone, but there could be bleed through effects." Her voice was sombre. "It's also unknown how much information can be transmitted between fragments, or to the real Orochimaru."</p><p>I cast a glance at Sasuke, who was pale. It was <em> interesting</em> that they were telling us all this…</p><p>"It leaves us with several problems," Tsunade concluded. "But we'll deal with those later." She looked at me expectantly and I started, realising I was expected to continue.</p><p>I ran through the rest of the fight with Kidomaru, about hiding Ino and going back for Kiba, all the way up to the beginning of the fight with Kimimaro.</p><p>"Okay," Tsunade cut in, holding up her hand. "Now Team Two."</p><p>Shikamaru folded his hands on the table and slumped over them, seeming no more excited than I was to speak.</p><p>"We went after Tayuya," he said. "The sole female of the group. She claimed to be the second strongest, after Sakon." He glanced towards Naruto, just a quick flick of the eyes. "She was predominantly a genjutsu type, using sound from her flute to carry the illusions, but she also had a set of large summons she called 'Doki'. They were controlled by her flute, and could consume physical energy."</p><p>At the second state, Tayayu had been a formidable opponent, capable of near-unbreakable full immobilisation genjutsu. Shikamaru's recital was dry and lacked emotion, but they'd been run through the ringer with several genjutsu simply because she was toying with them. The Doki had been strong, too, and Chouji had ended up taking the first of the three pills to be able to hold them off while Shikamaru attacked Tayuya herself. He'd ended up taking the second to defeat them when it turned out that even with short distance and as many advantages as he could stack up for himself, Shikamaru still hadn't been able to overpower Tayuya with his Shadow Neck-Binding Technique.</p><p>"Between the two of us, we were able to knock her out, and I made the decision to return to Konoha for medical aid rather than search for the other members of the squad," Shikamaru finished emotionlessly.</p><p>"It was the right decision," Tsunade said. "Naruto?"</p><p>"Right! So I was fighting the weird two headed guy, which was totally not just a head but an actual <em> other person</em> who could like, slither inside you." Naruto shivered. "He was pretty strong and just kept slicing through my clones and I didn't want to bring out the toads once I found out that he could get inside you and possess you then kill you. It was going okay, but then they split apart and he got me."</p><p>The adults all went still. I didn't even <em> want</em> to see what was on Jiraiya's face.</p><p>"He was like, crawling inside me, making my arms do stuff… so I pulled on…" he glanced around then firmed up. "I pulled on the Kyuubi's chakra and it pretty much just <em> burnt</em> him straight out of me."</p><p>He looked a little sick and I closed my eyes.</p><p><em> Hell.</em></p><p>The Kyuubi's chakra was poisonous, no doubt about that. What it would do to somebody trying to invade the body of its host… <em> burnt</em> might be too kind a word for it.</p><p>Half the room already knew the truth about him, anyway. Hinata didn't look at all surprised, but she had <em> been </em> there for the fighting and had <em> seen</em> him heal. Didn't mean there wasn't a sudden burst of noise, but much less than it could have been.</p><p>Tsunade thumped a hand on the table. "Naruto."</p><p>He smiled shakily. "I'm allowed to tell people, baa-chan! I'm the host of the Kyuubi, just like Gaara is the host of the Ichibi."</p><p>"Yes, yes," she rolled her eyes. "Let's drop another S-rank secret on the table. Why not."</p><p>"If Gaara became so angry because of his treatment," Lee spoke up, holding a fist into the air. "Then you have overcome much hardship to have such a positive outlook, Naruto! You inspire me!"</p><p>Naruto fidgeted. "Ahh, thanks, bushy-brows."</p><p>"'To carry a seal that can never be removed'," Neji said quietly. "I see. I apologise."</p><p>Naruto shrugged. "It's nothing. Don't worry about it. So… ah, after that, I took out Sakon and summoned one of the transport toads to take him back to Konoha." He looked eager to get back to talking about the mission and not himself.</p><p>"We have him," Tsunade said. "Though its uncertain if he'll survive the loss of his… partner."</p><p>Neji was then the last of the original squad to go. Jiroubou had apparently had quite an arsenal of earth ninjutsu to go with brutal taijutsu, including some that drained chakra, though they had been quite slow and avoidable, and Neji had had some trouble getting in to range for his Jyuuken to be effective. The fight had dragged out for quite some time when Tenten showed up to offer support. After that, they had had a much better time of it. Between the two of them, they had managed to bring him back, but by the time they arrived, there was little point in heading back out again.</p><p>"When we heard that our team mate was on a mission," Lee started when it was his turn. "Tenten and I went down to the gates to see if there was word of him! Then we became aware that the mission was in danger and felt it was our duty as shinobi to offer assistance! Hinata joined us, and the three of us went after our comrades! With much wisdom Tenten decided to assist Neji with his opponent, while I collected the prisoner off Shikamaru so that he could return to the village more quickly. Hinata went ahead to assist Kiba and Shikako!" He beamed.</p><p>This was where all the stories started coming back together again.</p><p>"I intercepted several attacks," Hinata said softly, a hint of her usual stammer. "Both Shikako and Kiba were heavily injured, a-and…" She tapped her fingers together. "I didn't do very well, but then Lee came."</p><p>I begged to disagree. "If you don't mind me asking," I said politely. "What was the attack you used… Protection of…"</p><p>Hinata looked down. "Protection of the Eight Trigrams; Sixty Four Palms. I-it is my failing that I cannot use the Kaiten, b-but I will not give up!" There was a spark of defiance in her eyes. "So I trained very hard and I created my own defence."</p><p>Neji's eyes widened.</p><p>"Well, I think it was awesome," Kiba said stubbornly. "Don't give me any of that 'not very good' crap."</p><p>Hinata went red and didn't speak.</p><p>Tsunade looked mostly amused at the by play. "Then?" she asked.</p><p>"Then I returned!" Lee said. "I too agree that Hinata was fighting excellently! Unfortunately, we were not able to overcome our opponent and Naruto also joined in the fight."</p><p>"Yeah, that guy was way tougher than Sakon," Naruto agreed. "All of us were fighting and pretty much not getting anywhere at all, and he wasn't even <em> using</em> his curse seal." Naruto rubbed his torso, almost unconsciously. "Then Sasuke was finished baking or whatever," Naruto said with a quick grin causing snorts of amusement, "and popped out. Then he pissed the bone guy off pretty bad. He stabbed me and you know, <em> ouch</em> , but it healed up pretty quickly."</p><p>It <em> had </em> been really bad. Beside me Sasuke stiffened, obviously remembering just <em> how</em> bad.</p><p>"I utilised the second stage of the curse mark," Sasuke said stiffly, gaining disapproving looks from Tsunade and Jiraiya. He'd probably already been told off for that. "Between the two of us, we regained the upper hand, and when the Sand shinobi showed up, we were able to defeat him."</p><p>It seemed… not enough. We'd said everything, but it still didn't encompass the terror and adrenaline and fear and pain… didn't cover the recovery most of us were still going through.</p><p>"Any questions?" Tsunade asked and though there was general shifting and glancing, no one wanted to ask. "Then I call this meeting over. You're all free to leave."</p><p>Ino was whisked off almost immediately, before any of us could try and talk to her. Shikamaru had a brief and hushed conversation with Chouji before hurrying after her.</p><p>"So that's what happened," Sasuke said. "That was the first time I heard…"</p><p>"Me too," I agreed. "I mean, I knew everyone was fine but I didn't know how the fights had gone." Everything had been so… rushed that <em> fine</em> was fine. But now that I knew… "Are you… okay, Naruto?"</p><p>He looked surprised. "Yeah, of course! Why wouldn't I be?"</p><p>"It just sounded pretty awful, that's all," I said carefully. "Having someone try and possess you like that." It wasn't like possession techniques were all that uncommon, but that had been an entirely different flavour to any he'd been exposed to before.</p><p>"Hah! No one can overpower the awesome that is Naruto Uzumaki!" He nearly bounced to his feet.</p><p>"You and your awesome better stay in that chair!" Tsunade threatened with a pointed finger. Naruto froze and slunk back down.</p><p>"Idiot," Sasuke muttered with a smirk. "Don't aggravate your injuries."</p><p>I let it go. Maybe I could have pushed the issue, but did I need to? Would it help? Would it make things worse? Sometimes 'fine' really meant 'fine'.</p><p>And the boys were bickering and the moment was gone…</p><p>Sometimes it was just easier to <em> not.</em></p><p>"I don't want to go back down there," Sasuke said with a sigh, glancing at Jiraiya. "I'm not going to <em> do</em> anything."</p><p>"I think it's for your safety," I said quietly. "Not to confine you."</p><p>Sasuke glanced at me sharply. "You think he'll send more people?"</p><p>I hummed noncommittally. "Maybe. But… they had to get so close to Konoha somehow. It might be that there's already someone here."</p><p>They couldn't keep Sasuke tucked away forever though. And would the prisoners be able to <em> identify </em> … whoever it was? Was there a backup plan? I couldn't even begin to guess, and it was all, frustratingly, out of my hands.</p><p>Sasuke's hands were clenched into fists. He hated this, I knew, being a target and having other people in danger for him. He hated being helpless.</p><p>"Sorry," I whispered, unable to come up with anything reassuring.</p><p>We fell silent. Most of the others had drifted out of the room, leaving it feeling strangely empty and echoing after having been so full.</p><p>"Common, kiddo," Jiraiya said, jerking his thumb at the door. "Enough chit-chat. We've got places to be."</p><p>Sasuke rose, resigned. I hoped this didn't go on for too long, because he was starting to chafe under it already.</p><p>Awkwardly, I rose and approached Tsunade. I'd been putting this off, but it was probably time to fess up. "Ah, Hokage-sama. On our mission to the Land of Tea I … recovered a village artefact. The Sword of the Thunder God-"</p><p>"Kid, I've got bigger things to worry about right now," she cut in, a little wearily. "And I sure as hell don't want it. It's fine, you can keep it. There are probably some Special Jounin that'll rage about it, but fuck 'em, if they wanted it they could have got it back themselves."</p><p>I opened and closed my mouth soundlessly. I'd only been going to ask where she wanted me to hand it in. It was a village artefact! It was, in fact, a Senju family artefact. And she was-</p><p>I bowed hastily. "Thank you, Tsunade-sama."</p><p><em> She was letting me keep it.</em></p><p>I wandered away, dazed. I hadn't even entertained the possibility. Much. Not seriously, anyway. It had come in handy, but it wasn't like I was a sword fighter.</p><p>"I need to learn kenjutsu," I muttered out loud. <em> Or the tanto.</em> It had been on my list of things to learn eventually, which grew longer by the day.</p><p>There was a whole world of possibilities here. <em> What happens when a sword that cuts chakra meets a sword that </em> eats<em> chakra?</em> Which would win, the legendary sword of the leaf or the legendary sword of the mist? I couldn't even begin to guess. And that wasn't even starting on other circumstances where it could come in handy.</p><p>I breathed in, breathed out. There was still so much going wrong. But, maybe, the future wasn't hopeless.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sound Four Arc: Chapter 64</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Nemesis Jedi – Tobirama is totally Shikako's favorite Hokage. Just saying. Even if inventing Zombie no Jutsu was a terribad move and the Uchiha Police Force thing didn't turn out so great either.</p><p>Anemos – I did hint at Shikako being able to sense natural chakra in one of the earlier chapters, and basically knew not to touch it until she could get instruction. And while she knew about the toads, she <em> didn't</em> know that monks basically did the same thing. But yes, using it is still a long way off. Sealing is an area that I think not a lot of shinobi get into. Mostly, I'd wager that seals are <em> copied.</em> You make an explosive tag by making it identical to <em> that</em> reference tag, rather than by understanding that this bit goes boom. Medical ninja would study medical seals, but probably wouldn't <em> create</em> new ones all that often, which makes Tsunade special. On the SotTG, well, Aoi had it despite it being his supposed bargaining chip into Hidden Rain, and it was implied that before that it was kept in a dusty storage room somewhere, so I can't see it being <em> that</em> important, despite all our reactions of <em> lightsaber. </em> XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 64</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies</p><p>This is the dawning of the rest of our lives ~ Green Day, Holiday</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Good," the medic-nin said, ticking off something on his clipboard. "Now again."</p><p>Obediently, I ran through the exercise again, pressing my palm flat to the table and lifting each finger in turn. It was surprisingly difficult for something so simple, and the muscles in my hand twinged with pain.</p><p>"It looks like you're right on track," he said. "Don't forget to do your exercises, and treat the scar tissue to keep it supple."</p><p>"I won't," I promised, slipping my compression glove back on and picking up the squeezy stress ball from the table.</p><p>"Try not to overdo it, either," he said with a wry smile. "It might seem slow, but you are healing well."</p><p>Objectively I knew he was probably right. It was just frustrating to be barely able to do anything.</p><p>It wasn't <em> just</em> because of my injuries; I was still rather lacking in chakra which made training difficult. I still had plenty to do, seal work mostly; the Sound Four had reminded me of barrier ninjutsu and I <em> was</em> rather lacking in defensive capabilities. Not to mention the other dozen or so ideas that had been kicking around in my head. Every time I accomplished one thing, it led to half a dozen more ideas about where it could go from there.</p><p>I left physiotherapy, absently rolling the ball over my fingers, and headed upwards. Ino was finally allowed visitors and I <em> had</em> to see her.</p><p>"Hey, Ino," I said, hovering in the doorway.</p><p>She was sitting quietly on her hospital bed, staring blankly at an open book on her lap. Her eyes were still slitted and I felt guilty for wishing that the physical sign of change had gone away.</p><p>She glanced up, reflexively, before lowering her eyes again. Her bangs were brushed forward, loose across her face, almost as if she were trying to hide.</p><p>"Hi," she said dully. She looked better than she had at the briefing but still not… quite herself. And I knew what if felt like, to realise that your very <em> self</em> was malleable, that what made you <em> you</em> could be <em> changed </em> so easily…</p><p>I had been lucky enough to come back to myself unharmed. Ino… hadn't been.</p><p>How much, and how badly, she'd been changed… that I didn't know.</p><p>I crept forward, feeling as if I was intruding. The silence in the room was suffocating. "I-" I cleared my throat. "I'm sorry. I should have come up with a better plan."</p><p>For a second, I thought she wasn't going to respond. I wasn't even sure she heard me. But then Ino took a shaky breath. "I should have listened," she said, eventually. "You warned me that it would be dangerous. But." She blew out a breath. "I was… so sure it would work. It <em> should</em> have worked. It's… Mind-Body Switch isn't <em> easy</em> you know. I trained <em> hard</em> to be able to do that." She looked frustrated, maybe even on the verge of tears. "It's not a lot, not compared to you or Sasuke or even <em> Chouji</em> can do but it's all I <em> have</em> ." Her voice cracked on the last word. "Without it I don't have <em> anything</em> and I'm not – I don't want to be useless."</p><p>"Oh, Ino. You're not-" I hurried to reassure her, startled at the sudden turn the conversation had taken.</p><p>"No," she bit out. "Don't. Just, don't, okay? I really screwed up. I know…" she hiccupped and buried her face in her hands.</p><p>I stared at her in bewilderment and perched on the side of the bed, hugging her awkwardly. I was at a loss for what to do. Of all of us, Sakura had been the one prone to tears, not Ino. Never Ino. "You did <em> fine,</em> Ino. No one could have known about the curse seal. It doesn't make you useless."</p><p>"I was nothing but dead weight," she said, still muffled. "The whole mission, I did nothing to help. I –" she choked and shuddered. "I was so happy when I made the finals. My first try, as a rookie. Dad didn't even manage that. The only Konoha kunoichi… but I <em> lost</em> and, and you've all come so <em> far</em> -"</p><p>I listened in confusion, stroking her back soothingly.</p><p>"You don't even <em> need me</em> anymore. You're… you've changed <em> so much</em> and you're so strong now and I don't even know when that happened. And Sakura is advancing so fast and you know there's talk about apprenticing her to one of the medics? <em> No one</em> does that anymore. Even Hinata is… and I'm still just <em> me, </em> and you don't need me anymore!"</p><p>This wasn't just about this mission. It wasn't even <em> mostly</em> about this mission.</p><p>"I – of course we do, Ino," I said. "You're my best friend. And Sakura would say the same." I hadn't changed that much since becoming a Genin, had I? "And you just had a bad matchup. It <em> happens.</em> It doesn't mean you're weak."</p><p>"You don't." She pushed away, wiping her eyes. "You used to follow me or Shikamaru around. You'd hardly even <em> speak</em> to anyone else. And now you're helping plan A-ranks or whatever and you're like a completely different person."</p><p>I stared at her. Of all the ways this conversation could have gone, this wasn't one I had been prepared for.</p><p>"It was easier," I said haltingly. "To let you take charge when you were there. You're good at… at people and at organising things. Like our study group. None of the rest of us could have made it happen. But that's not the only reason… I'm <em> sorry</em> if you feel… if we haven't made it clear that… you're important, Ino. Not for what you do but just for being Ino." I felt clumsy and useless, trying to put into words something so simple and so complicated at the same time.</p><p>Ino just gave a watery smile. "That's the Shikako I remember. 'Good at people'. Heh."</p><p>"That's what I get for trying to give a heart-to-heart speech?" I asked, trying for indignant, but mostly just feeling relieved that Ino was <em> listening</em> and joking. "Maybe I should just have gone to get Sakura."</p><p>"Sakura doesn't get it," Ino said, voice low, fingers twisting the edge of the blanket. "She hasn't seen-"</p><p>She gave me a helpless look.</p><p>"We're all growing apart," I said. And that was the problem, wasn't it? It wasn't something that you could counter, all of us having different experiences, but Ino was reaching out, trying to find something familiar to hold herself to and… it wasn't quite what she was expecting. "Sakura hasn't had to fight; she's still studying." She might have had to see the aftermath, at the hospital, but it wasn't the same. And maybe she was thinking the same, having seen things in the hospital that we hadn't seen in the field.</p><p>"Yeah," Ino agreed, subdued. "I just didn't expect it to happen so fast."</p><p>She went silent, and after a while, I tentatively breached a question. "Are you… okay though? With … everything." I waved a hand aimlessly, trying to refer to what had just happened without words. If Inoichi wasn't working with her any longer, and she was allowed visitors, I was pretty sure that meant she was on the road to recovery, but that didn't mean she thought she was fine.</p><p>Ino glanced at me. "No," she said, as if testing the word. "No, I'm not."</p><p>I stalled. I hadn't been expecting a negative answer – truthful or not.</p><p>"I just…" Ino began. "I don't know how you did it… I didn't think about it then, but when Tsunade came back and healed you, you just… got up. Started training again, like nothing had happened. But, I can't." She laughed, sounding a little too desperate and hysterical to be entirely comforting. "I <em> can't.</em> I lost bits of myself and I <em> don't even</em> <em> know what's missing. </em> How can I be okay? How can I just <em> get up</em> ? How did you do it?"</p><p>And how could I explain? How could I say that Tsukiyomi had been awful…That the press of foreign chakra and that forced sharp perception had been damaging… That in the short term the horror of watching so many people die so messily had <em> hurt…</em> that waking up to find a month gone, people moving on, had been confusing, but … I'd had <em> years</em> of waking up knowing that I'd lost <em> everything.</em> Family, friends, pets, home, <em> places, language, culture…</em> so much that I hadn't even acknowledged, just taken for granted as being there. It wasn't something I thought about, even now when I loved what I had, when the loss was merely painful rather than completely and utterly incomprehensible.</p><p>How could I explain that I had gotten up, reached out, kept <em> trying</em> because by now it was all I could do to keep moving onwards.</p><p>I swallowed. I didn't really like thinking about it, especially in those terms. It had been <em> years…</em> "Sometimes… if I look out the window at sunset and the sky is red…" I said quietly. "It feels like I never left." That wasn't something I had ever voiced aloud. But if Ino needed to hear it… "It's not like it didn't affect me. I just… got up. I get up. Every morning. That's the hardest part." My lips twisted into something that probably wasn't a smile. I couldn't really look at Ino, staring blankly past her at the wall. "You set a goal, something that you have to do, even if it's just something small. 'I have to get up, because I have to visit Ino today'. After that, it's just momentum to keep yourself going."</p><p>That one was an old trick. <em> I have to get up because I have class. I have to get up because I have work. </em> Ninja didn't have such a schedule, and without one I had to set my own goals for the day, otherwise I'd laze about in bed all day and I knew it.</p><p>"Oh," Ino breathed in surprise.</p><p>"It is okay to not be okay, you know," I added quietly. "You don't have to get up right away. And… you can ask us to help you. Or… if you don't want to ask… we'll help anyway." Because I had trouble asking for help and I didn't know if Ino was the same. Probably not; she'd never had any problem telling people what she wanted but… just in case.</p><p>Ino slumped back against the headboard. "Thanks," she said softly. "I just realised… I never asked. You said you were fine and that was it."</p><p>"It's okay," I said with a shrug. "I was fine."</p><p>"You mean you wouldn't have fessed up if I didn't need to hear it," she corrected, a little sadly.</p><p>I tried to weigh up if that was a good response or a bad one and what I needed to say in return. I didn't want to set her off again, and she was being… changeable. It was like walking in a minefield. There were things you didn't want to step on, but you didn't know where.</p><p>"Never mind." Ino sighed. "Look, I just… need some time to think, okay? I'll talk to you about it some other time."</p><p>I nodded, said my goodbyes and left. I didn't kid myself into thinking one conversation had fixed everything. But maybe it was headed in the right direction.</p><p>I slipped away from Ino's room, feeling wrung out. How could visiting a friend be more exhausting than physical rehabilitation?</p><p>I brought myself a drink from the vending machine and settled into the courtyard to drink it. There was bright sunshine, gentle wind, birds singing in the tree and the low chatter of other people enjoying the day, and none of it could ease the unhappy tightness inside me.</p><p>I stayed longer than I meant to – not that I had concrete plans – and eventually a gaggle of students spilled out into the courtyard, carrying books and food.</p><p>"Shikako!" Sakura said brightly, waving goodbye to the others and ducking out of the crowd. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>"Hey." I managed a smile. "Friends of yours?"</p><p>Sakura sank down onto the ground next to me, setting her books in a stack. "They're the third year medical students," she said, glancing away and tucking her hair behind her ear. "They're alright, I guess."</p><p>They did look a bit older, I noted, maybe sixteen on average, though a few were older than that. They hadn't looked particularly surprised when Sakura had broken off from the group, though a few had waved at her. Not close friends, no, but friendly, at least.</p><p>"I'm glad I came outside, then," Sakura said. "Usually I go to the library at lunch."</p><p>She was peering at me, green eyes bright and slightly anxious and I was at a loss for what to say. "Ah," I agreed, taking a sip of my drink to cover the pause. "Lucky."</p><p>"I heard about what happened," she said, slightly hushed after a pause. "A bit, I mean. But you were hurt, weren't you?" She made an aborted move towards my arm. "Can I?"</p><p>I held it out to her mutely, but instead of unwrapping the bandages or inspecting it like I had anticipated, her chakra sank into my arm. I jerked a little, in surprise, not <em> quite</em> yanking my arm from her light grip.</p><p>Had Sakura <em> ever</em> used her chakra on me? I didn't think so. It was unlikely she'd known how to do this prior to joining the Medical Corps and I didn't think there had been an opportunity since. Maybe it was just the timing of it, but her chakra reminded me of the sleeping gas they'd used to knock me out for surgery, faintly sweet and chemical, light enough to overlook if I didn't remember how fast it had worked.</p><p>Something in her face eased and she drew back. "I thought it would be worse," she admitted, a little shyly.</p><p>I thought about the pounding terror, the slick feeling of blood sliding between my fingers, the sharp pain of the initial injury and the repeated star bursts as I moved it. I thought about pressing it to my stomach and hoping it wasn't deep. I thought about the long, dark walk home and the contrast to where we were sitting now. It barely seemed real.</p><p>"Ah," I said staring down at my neatly bandaged forearm; hand tucked away in a compression glove. My fingers flexed. "It could have been worse."</p><p>"Have you seen Ino?" Sakura asked, sitting back and unpacking her bento box. She offered me some, and I waved her off. "I did this morning. She seemed… quiet."</p><p>Quiet wouldn't have been the word I would have used, but she probably hadn't ranted at Sakura like she had at me.</p><p>"Just now," I said, wondering if I should share. But… it <em> was</em> personal, wasn't it? It wasn't something that should be gossiped about… "We should do something for her."</p><p>"Something?" Sakura queried. "Like what?"</p><p>I shrugged. "I don't know. A get well present? Dinner? A day out?" Something that said 'we're friends. Even if everything is changing, we're still friends'.</p><p>"That could be fun," Sakura agreed. "Maybe we could go to the onsen. Or, ooh, shopping. It's been a while since we've all just hung out."</p><p>I was content to stay silent and let her eat, my attention drifting off.</p><p>"So what have you been working on? And don't say 'nothing much'. I'll never believe you."</p><p>"Seals, mostly," I said. "Can't do much physical training at the moment, or hand seals so…" I shrugged. "Actually, maybe there's something you can help with. If you've got time or whatever." She was the only other person I knew with supposed 'perfect' chakra control, and well, this was something she <em> had</em> been able to master. I hadn't intended to broach the subject so soon, not until I had a chance to test her reaction.</p><p>Sakura looked interested. "Yeah? I don't know much about seals."</p><p>"It's not sealing," I said. I grabbed a piece of blank paper and started sketching a rough limb and chakra movement. "Most people use chakra enhancements to increase their strength, right? But there's a limit to the amount that you can do so, before you actually start damaging muscles and tendons by putting too much strain on them. The better you are at balancing which parts you reinforce, the higher the limit is, but it still plateaus."</p><p>"Yeah," Sakura agreed. "We learnt that at the Academy."</p><p>"Right. So, to get beyond that plateau you'd need to do something different right?" I kept sketching, drawing down the ideas I'd worked out some time ago. "Like, say, the release of precisely timed chakra bursts as kinetic energy to maximise physical damage?"</p><p>Sakura blinked. "You'd blow your arm off with the backlash!" she objected.</p><p>"Not if you were counter-reinforcing it," I returned, scribbling the key points down. Okay, my drawings were horrible and my actual calculations were encoded in my notebooks at home, but it got the general gist across.</p><p>"I guess," she said doubtfully. "But the precise chakra controlled that would be required to do <em> both</em> at the same time would be…" she trailed off and frowned. "Where did you get the idea for this again?"</p><p>"There are quite a few famous strength enhancing techniques," I demurred.</p><p>But Sakura wasn't deterred. "This is Tsunade-sama's strength technique!" she hissed, leaning in close so no one would hear her. "You can't-"</p><p>"Not entirely," I prevaricated. "I don't know how Tsunade-sama does her technique. But I would assume that she does do something similar, yes."</p><p>Sakura didn't look impressed, but I noticed she hadn't let go of the paper. "This is impossible," she said.</p><p>"The numbers work," I countered. Of course 'in theory' was much different to 'in practice'. There was a reason I hadn't exactly <em> tried</em> it.</p><p>"Do they?" Sakura asked doubtfully.</p><p>"If you assume one hundred per cent accuracy in chakra conversion and conservation," I conceded.</p><p>"Even medical techniques don't assume more than ninety per cent. Ninety five for the seal based techniques. And assuming you can hold effectively two techniques at the same time is just <em> asking</em> for trouble."</p><p>"Not as much as you would think," I countered, getting into the spirit of an academic argument. "Most ninja effectively hold bodily chakra enhancements while fighting, even when using gen, tai or ninjutsu. It becomes a passive technique that requires little concentration to hold."</p><p>"True," Sakura conceded, pursing her lips. "I still think there are problems."</p><p>"Run through it, then," I suggested. "Work it out and we can trade notes, see what we both came up with and which would work. I'll have to decode mine…"</p><p>Sakura bit her lip, staring down at the paper. "I – well- it's Tsunade-sama's technique! We can't just…"</p><p>"Try and recreate it?" I asked. "You think we're the only people that have tried this?"</p><p>"So what makes you think we'll <em> manage</em> ?" Sakura retorted. "If no one else has?"</p><p>Which was a good point. "Is that enough to stop you trying?"</p><p>She looked torn. On one hand, this was a <em> challenge</em> , an intellectual challenge at the moment, which was the kind she loved the most. On the other hand… yes, it did seem a little underhand to try and recreate our Hokage's technique.</p><p>"We'll get in trouble."</p><p>"It's possible," I admitted. "But we're pretty much creating it from scratch just, you know, inspired by a technique that already exists." And any ninja that told you they'd never been inspired by someone else's techniques was a dirty liar.</p><p>"That's just details and you know it." But she folded the paper up. "I'll… look at it. I'm not promising anything! But I'll look at it."</p><p>Which was saying that she was interested enough to try and work the <em> theory</em> of the technique out. Whether or not she'd help with the practice, well, that was another bridge to cross when we got there.</p><p>I smiled. "So how's your training going?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Are you going to come and see the Sand Team off?" Shikamaru asked, leaning against the doorframe casually.</p><p>"Mmm?" I hummed, half listening as I wrote. "Wait, what? They're leaving? How do you know that?"</p><p>Shikamaru rolled his eyes. "Some of us have left the house recently, you know."</p><p>"I thought you were helping out at the Academy," I said, puzzled. I was pretty sure that was what he had been complaining about recently.</p><p>"Yeah," Shikamaru agreed. "So were they."</p><p>And that was unexpected, yet brilliant at the same time. It kept foreign ninja occupied, under the watch of the few ninja in Konoha who were (debatably) able to spare an eye, showcased Konoha's strengths and exposed the kids to foreign ninja under friendly circumstances. The risks were, of course, letting foreign ninja who had recently been enemies around Konoha's children.</p><p>Some might have said that the risk was too high, even if we were nominally allies.</p><p>"Huh." I blinked. "Right. Okay." I set my work down and grabbed my kunai pouch. Not that I thought I'd need it, but it felt weird not wearing it. It was like leaving the house without my keys. Or something.</p><p>We headed out to the main gates. Ninja weren't really that big on saying goodbye, or seeing people off, but it felt like the right thing to do.</p><p>"Have you been working with them a lot?" I asked curiously, because it was odd for Shikamaru to go out of his way for anything.</p><p>"A bit." Shikamaru shrugged. He cast a sideways glance at me. "Was there something you wanted to say to them?"</p><p>I shook my head. "I already said what I had to say." I wasn't sure how it had gone over, but I'd said it.</p><p>Shikamaru gave me an odd look, and yeah, okay it wasn't like he knew what I'd had to say to them. Hopefully he assumed it was something like 'thanks'.</p><p>There was a quiet bustle of activity at the gates, but at a glance there was no one I recognised. Shikamaru didn't say anything, and just propped himself up against the wall with folded arms, so I mirrored him, absently rolling my stress ball over my fingers.</p><p>"Huh," Temari said, pausing in the middle of the street and cocking a hand on her hip. She stared at Shikamaru. "What do you think you're doing here?" Her brothers halted beside her, seeming content to allow her to be the one to speak.</p><p>"Even if it's troublesome," Shikamaru said, "it's only polite to say goodbye when allies are leaving." There was a tone of familiarity to their exchange, of banter. I was strangely fascinated at the hint that Shikamaru and Temari might have become friends while she was here. It was something I hadn't seen developing, hadn't been a part of, a side to my brother that was entirely separate from me.</p><p>Although 'friends' might have been stretching it a bit. There seemed to be a mutual wariness between them all; that of foreign shinobi watching each other carefully, evaluating every word and move.</p><p>"Thank you for your help," I said, bowing shallowly. "It was lucky for us that you were here."</p><p>To my surprise, it was Gaara that bowed back, albeit very stiffly. "We were assigned this mission merely to get us out of the village now that there is no one with the power to contain us," he rasped and I knew by 'us' he meant himself, most of all. "And as a subtle discourtesy to your village. And yet…" he paused, seeming to search for words. "I am glad we were here."</p><p>Because sending an unsheathable weapon, a Jinchuriki known for insanity and one who had recently attacked our village no less, on a simple delivery errand had to have all kinds of hidden meanings. And yet, in one simple move, Tsunade had turned their insult into our victory.</p><p>Temari and Kankurou both looked slightly ataken back, but recovered quickly. "That's right," Temari agreed. "But try not to get into too much trouble. I'd hate to have to make the trip from Suna that often."</p><p>Shikamaru smirked slightly. "Likewise."</p><p>Kankurou shifted a little, adjusting the weight of his puppet on his back. "Right. Now that Temari has gotten all of her sappy goodbyes out of the way; let's blow this joint."</p><p>He ignored the dark look Temari shot his way with the ease of long practice.</p><p>They were just about to head out the gates when someone yelled "Wait! Wait" from behind us.</p><p>I turned, bemused, and watched as Konohamaru dragged a confused Naruto through the crowd.</p><p>"We had to find the Boss," Konohamaru explained, panting. "That took <em> forever.</em> "</p><p>Moegi and Udon, having been apparently left in the dust as Konohamaru raced off, appeared as well. More surprisingly, Ebisu-sensei was tailing them. I was amused to note that Moegi had a obi tied over her normal outfit, dangling a large sloppily tied bow behind her much like Temari.</p><p>"Whadda you midgets want?" Kankurou demanded gruffly. "Aren't you supposed to be in class?"</p><p>"We're here to say goodbye!" Konohamaru retorted. He marched smartly up to Gaara and nearly tripped over his own scarf. He shoved a piece of paper towards Gaara. "We made it," he added unnecessarily.</p><p>Gaara blinked.</p><p>Konohamaru was, much like Naruto, the kind of person who would react to something that intimidated him by reaching out and poking it. Of course, his run in before the Chunin Exams had mostly been with <em> Kankurou</em> and it didn't look like he'd forgiven that.</p><p>"Thank you," Gaara said quietly. From here, I could barely see what had been handed to him, but it looked … colourful. And potentially glittery.</p><p>"Thank you for helping Ebisu-sensei teach our class," Udon sniffled. "I hope you come back soon."</p><p>Moegi beamed, clasping her hands together. "We'd like it if you visited!"</p><p>Ebisu-sensei adjusted his glasses. "Your assistance at the Academy was much appreciated. I'm sure the other teachers will agree with my assessment that you were valuable assistants."</p><p>Naruto looked uncharacteristically sombre. I recalled that Temari had mentioned Gaara wanting to speak to him, and I hoped they had. It would probably have been good for both of them. "I guess this is goodbye then," he said. "You know, when you first showed up here, I thought you were just a crazy guy. I was even a little scared of you. But we're a lot more alike than I ever would have guessed." He laughed, a little uncomfortably. "Ah, I guess what I'm trying to say is; I'm glad you found precious people of your own. Even if we didn't get to fight, I can tell that you're a lot stronger now. So, you better keep getting even stronger, because that's what I'm going to be doing!"</p><p>Gaara nodded slowly. "Yes. I think I will."</p><p><hr /></p><p>It was mid-afternoon when I knocked on the door to the Yamanaka residence, carefully wrapped host gift in my arms. I'd been surprised to receive a <em> formal</em> invitation from them, but the card had had touches of pure Ino all over it, so I'd hoped she was having fun planning a dinner party.</p><p>I was a little early, but Sakura was already there.</p><p>"Hey, Shikako! Come help me take this into Ino's room!" She gave an aborted wave, hands full of snack food and nibbles.</p><p>I slid the gift onto the bench and picked up an armload. "Sure. So whose coming to this thing? Do you know?"</p><p>"Not many people, actually," Sakura replied with a tiny, barely noticeable frown. "Us, Hinata… I think Tenten. That's about it."</p><p>"A real girls night out," I said. "None of her friends from the Academy are coming?"</p><p>Ino had had a much larger social circle than the two of us, and it seemed odd that they weren't here, especially compared to a recent friend like Tenten. I doubted that five months was enough time for her to completely stop talking to them.</p><p>"I don't think so," Sakura said. "I think she just wanted a small get together?" She didn't seem very certain of the fact.</p><p>I shrugged. I couldn't really blame her if she did. Even after she'd left the hospital, I hadn't seen her much; she was keeping herself quietly tucked away.</p><p>Ino's room had been rearranged, with a small table for the snacks and drinks and several kneeling cushions.</p><p>"Hullo," Ino said, beaming, as she shuffled the flower arrangement on the table. "What do you think? At the end or the middle?" She moved the vase back and forth several times.</p><p>I glanced at it. "Middle?" I offered, helping set the bowls down.</p><p>"Middle it is then. Perfect!" She looked happy; much more like herself in spirit. It was good to see.</p><p>"Having fun then?" I asked, amused. "I liked the camellia with the invitation. Victory under adversity?" There were several meanings, but I was pretty sure that was the one she intended to use.</p><p>Ino gave a secretive looking smile.</p><p>"I got a convolvulus with mine," Sakura said. "Perseverance."</p><p>"So we all got something different?" It did make sense, if she was trying to send a message.</p><p>"I'm not saying," Ino said, with a laugh. "You'll have to wait to work it out. I bet it's killing you now."</p><p>Playfully, I stuck my tongue out at her. "No, it's not!" I liked puzzles, true, but not so much that I couldn't wait.</p><p>Tenten showed up next, looking a little awkward and intimidated.</p><p>"Glad you could come," I said.</p><p>She sidled close to me, looking relieved. "I didn't know what to expect," she said lowly. No wonder she was intimidated, then. The Yamanaka might not have been a <em> huge</em> clan, but they were fairly well entrenched into the community. For an orphan like Tenten, a formal invite might have heralded a lot of nerves. Especially considering we were just casual acquaintances.</p><p>Well, I didn't know if Ino knew her better than I did.</p><p>"Do you know Ino well?" I asked.</p><p>Tenten hesitated. "Okay, I guess. Well, we hung out a bit when… when Sasuke was on my team." She shrugged. "She was someone to talk to when I got sick of the two of them."</p><p>That … actually made more sense than 'lets invite the kunoichi who went on the last mission with us'.</p><p>"I wouldn't worry about it," I said. "I think the invites were just Ino getting carried away. If you make things too formal, it just gets boring."</p><p>A smile tugged at her lips. "Well we wouldn't want that."</p><p>Hinata arrived precisely on time, knocking timidly on the door. "Oh," she said softly, staring at us. "I'm sorry, I…" She trailed off miserably, fiddling with her sleeves.</p><p>"That's a lovely kimono," Sakura said brightly.</p><p>It was. Very much so. The problem was that none of the rest of us were anywhere <em> near</em> as dressed up. Awkward.</p><p>"That," Ino proclaimed. "Is a <em> brilliant</em> idea, Hinata. We should all get dressed up. It'll be fun." She bounced to her feet.</p><p>And amidst the giggling and flying cloth, as we raided Ino's wardrobe, I remembered to ask "so what flowers did you get with your invitation?"</p><p>"Chrysanthemum," Hinata demurred shyly. "Thank you, Ino. It was lovely."</p><p>Tenten shrugged. "It was blue?"</p><p>Well, colour could change the meaning, but the way Ino burst into giggles, I figured that wasn't the point.</p><p>"What? I have better things to do that memorize a billion different types of flowers," Tenten said defensively.</p><p>"It was an iris," Ino gasped out.</p><p>I nodded. "So, camellia for victory. Convolvulus for perseverance. Chrysanthemum for natural perfection. Iris for heroism." I thought about it. "Natural beauty is a warrior who perseveres and finds victory despite adversity?"</p><p>"That's so cool!" Sakura said, clasping her hands together, eyes a little starry. "A kunoichi only grows more beautiful as she fights."</p><p>Which wasn't <em> quite </em> the interpretation I would have taken from it but I guess I couldn't fault Sakura for it.</p><p>We spent ages getting ready and doing unrepentantly girly things like our hair and nails – shinobi nail protector was like the holy grail of nail polish, long lasting, non-chip enamel designed to stop your nails getting caught and tearing on things or the multitude of nasty things that could happen when you used your hands for a living.</p><p>"Don't you girls look nice," Ino's mother said when we came downstairs for dinner. "I feel underdressed."</p><p>Like my family, the Yamanaka normally at a table with chairs, which was just easier and more convenient, but for formal occasions low tables and seiza cushions were preferred.</p><p>Dinner was excellent and I ended up striking up a conversation with Tenten about seals.</p><p>"When you offered me a book," she confessed. "I thought you meant a textbook."</p><p>"There aren't many textbooks on the subject," I said. "Or at least, not that I've found." The revelation that sealing was a method that varied from person to person because of individual experiences and preconceptions probably helped to explain that. "Has it been helpful?"</p><p>"Very. I'm thinking… you've been able to modify seals right? One of the problems I have with using storage scrolls to hold weapons is that, well, I have so many of them. And throwing the scrolls is easy enough, but they make a target."</p><p>"And you either have to seal everything into one seal, and then have it all appear at once, or use a lot of separate seals," I continued, having an inkling of where she was going. It was the first place my mind had gone.</p><p>"Right. Storage seals are all in or all out. You can't, say, put two things in and then take one out. But what if you could? If you could make a permanent, partial opening seal that could be used repeatedly?"</p><p><em> Hammerspace. Totally.</em></p><p>"Well, storage seals actually don't have any shape when they're empty. They're … collapsed, I guess, and they take the shape of the object that's put on them. Which is why you can store food in there without it going rotten, because there's no air or heat… you could try sealing, I don't know, a box and then putting things in and out of <em> that</em> pre-sealed space, but I'm not sure how you'd go about opening it and getting things out without collapsing the whole thing," I admitted. "You might need a completely different base seal instead. Maybe combine it with summoning…"</p><p>"Yeah," Tenten said, looking animated. "I've been thinking about that. I've been calling it the door way effect. If a seal is like a room, then usually you're <em> building</em> it around whatever you want to seal, and taking it down when you're done. And if you knock out one of the walls, then it doesn't have enough support and collapses. But most rooms have doorways, and they can support a bit of structural weakness, you just need to find a spot that will hold. And obviously, put a door in so you can open and close it."</p><p>It was a simple analogy, but I could see what she meant. Find a point in the seal where you could put a doorway or a tunnel and then pull things in and out through that. Like going through the back door instead of the trapped and guarded front gates.</p><p>Across the table, Ino moved her hands in a 'blah blah' motion. "Boring work talk," she decided.</p><p>"Hey," Tenten shot back. "I listened to you lot talk flowers before."</p><p>Eventually, Tenten and Hinata left with happy smiles to head home. Sakura and I had been invited to stay the night, like we'd done many times before.</p><p>"You know," Ino said, unrolling the extra futons while Sakura was in the bathroom brushing her teeth. "For someone who says they're no good at people, you're excellent at getting us to help each other."</p><p>I gave her a puzzled look. "What do you mean?"</p><p>"Sakura told me it was your idea. To get us all together."</p><p>"Oh. Well, I meant for us to do something for you, not …" I shrugged a shoulder. "I didn't think you were going to throw a party."</p><p>"It was good though, wasn't it?" Ino asked, rhetorically. "I would have missed this."</p><p>That… wasn't quite right. "Ino?"</p><p>She glanced up. "Just hear me out, okay? I've been doing a lot of thinking these last few days and I know you're just dying to hear." Her voice took a teasing lit, though it was still serious.</p><p>"Okay," I said slowly.</p><p>"I've been thinking about quitting," she said bluntly.</p><p>I wasn't sure if I could have spoken if I'd wanted too.</p><p>"I know. I'd have to abdicate as clan heir and everything, but I have cousins who could take the role. It wouldn't be too hard." She leant back against the wall. "I really thought about it. All this stuff in my head… it taints everything. I'll never know, ever again, if something is what I want, what I like, or if its <em> him</em> . If I'm being influenced… it's not just as simple as having his memories. There's more to a person than that and I don't even <em> know</em> which parts –" She shook her head. "There's always going to be doubt. Like, if I keep learning medical ninjutsu, is it me? Or is it something I picked up from him? Am I going to wander down the same path he did? Even something that's supposed to be for helping people is tainted now."</p><p>I wanted to speak, to reassure her that she wouldn't, but she wasn't finished yet.</p><p>"But… I always wanted to be a kunoichi. I wanted to lead the clan. I wanted to fight and to heal and to help people. If I quit now… if I quit because of him… that decision is going to be tainted too."</p><p>We were silent for a second.</p><p>"Natural beauty," I quoted quietly, "is the warrior who perseveres and finds victory despite adversity."</p><p>Ino smiled. "We're going to bloom into the most beautiful flowers of all. Just you wait."</p><p><hr /></p><p>This chapter took forever to write, which is a shame, because this was the bit I was looking forward to writing three chapters ago. : (</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sound Four Arc: Chapter 65</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>Anemos – Most of the meanings come of the net, from a variety of different sites. I do not even remotely claim for them to be correct, and I basically pick and choose to fit what I need. XD Its just something that I think Ino would do, especially with her 'you're like the cosmos' talk to Sakura in canon.</p><p>So this chapter took a while. We moved house, and in what shall be referred to as The Great Internet Debacle of 2013 were left without internet for two weeks. It was <em> terrible</em> I tell you. Add that to the audit at work and things got a bit busy.</p><p>As always, the next chapter will take exactly as long as it takes me to write it. I don't sit on them once they're done guys. You get it when it's finished.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 65</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> But for every man there exists a bait which he cannot resist swallowing ~ Friedrich Nietzsche</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Shikako!" Naruto hollered. "The pervy sage said that they were letting Sasuke out today." He grabbed my hand and started tugging me along the street. "Come on!"</p><p>I felt a surge of relief. It had been a while, and Sasuke was <em> sure</em> to hate being locked up. And, well, if they were letting him leave the secure ward, they had to have some kind of plan as to how to keep him safe, right?</p><p>"That's great!" I chirped, abandoning the shopping I had been about to do in order to follow Naruto.</p><p>"Yeah! We can start doing missions again! It'll be awesome!"</p><p>Personally, I wasn't quite sure I was up for a mission just yet, but I wasn't about to rain on Naruto's parade.</p><p>We waited in the reception area of the hospital – Naruto impatiently bouncing around and babbling – until Jiraiya arrived with Sasuke.</p><p>"Hey," I said, lamely as he slouched forward, hands in his pockets looking terribly, desperately bored.</p><p>"Finally!" Naruto said. "I thought we were waiting for Sensei or something. Geeze! You sure took your time."</p><p>Sasuke scoffed. "Tell that to him," he said, jerking his thumb at where Jiraiya was hanging over the reception desk. I would have assumed he was signing them out, but there was an awful lot of giggling happening.</p><p>"Glad to be out of there?" I asked dryly.</p><p>"You have no idea," Sasuke said seriously. "I was so bored."</p><p>"I did say you could read my books," Jiraiya said, suddenly standing behind Sasuke and clapping him on the shoulders. Sasuke twitched. "Action, adventure, romance! What more could you want?"</p><p>"Stop trying to get people to read your stupid pervy books!" Naruto shouted. "It's bad enough that Kakashi-sensei does." Which lead to Jiraiya protesting that his books weren't stupid, thank you very much.</p><p>Sasuke seemed to find the floor very, very interesting.</p><p><em> Bored indeed, </em> I thought, bumping his shoulder with mine.</p><p>"Don't say a word," he ground out lowly.</p><p>I smirked. Suddenly, it seemed like everything was <em> right</em> again, as if things had just been so slightly out of whack. If this was what a week split up was like, then Sasuke and I were going to have hell when Naruto left.</p><p>"You have no taste," Jiraiya said, turning his back on a fuming Naruto. "No appreciation for fine literature at all." He clapped his hands together. "Alright munchkins. Let's go!"</p><p>"You're coming with us, Jiraiya-sama?" I asked curiously, as the three of us fell into step behind him.</p><p>"Yeah! You said you'd teach me something!" Naruto jumped in. "Except every time I find you, you run away to perv on women or something."</p><p>"I'm a busy man," Jiraiya protested. "Things to do, people to meet, sights to, eh-he-he, see…" the grin on his face hardly countered Naruto's accusation.</p><p>It was probable that he <em> was</em> busy though. If he'd been decrypting Sasuke seal, applying seals to the Sound Four prisoners as Tsunade had implied, probably managing whatever information his spy network was bringing in and, well, anything else that came up… the fact that he'd taken the time to see Naruto at all said something.</p><p>"Hmph." Naruto crossed his arms and scowled. "Yeah, yeah. Whatever."</p><p>"Hop to it, then!" He clapped his hands together. "We don't want to waste time."</p><p>We ended up at our normal training field, despite a small altercation between Naruto and Jiraiya as he tried to steer us nearer to the bath houses.</p><p>"Now what?" Naruto asked eagerly. "Are you going to teach us a cool jutsu?"</p><p>Jiraiya put his chin in his hand thoughtfully. "Actually… how's your Rasengan coming along?"</p><p>Naruto's face fell. "I can already do that!"</p><p>"One handed?" Jiraiya probed. "The trick with the clones is clever, no doubt about that, but you're hampering yourself by not being able to use it instantly."</p><p>Naruto sulked and stomped off. I could see him starting to practice though – without his clones helping him.</p><p>"Well that was easy," Jiraiya said idly, turning to the rest of us. Or rather, to me. Sasuke had already moved off, and was going through a series of warm up stretches. "Alright then. How's your sealing coming along?"</p><p>"Alright," I said with a shrug. "I've been trying to work on some barrier seals."</p><p>"Got inspired, huh?" Jiraiya said. "That's a big topic, though. Covers a hell of a lot. Anything specific that you're looking at?"</p><p>I nodded. "I wanted to make a defensive barrier – something that you could activate from a tag, maybe – that would block attacks. There are a couple of trap barriers that won't let anything pass through, but they can be complicated to set up." Like the barrier that the Sound Four had used to trap the Hokage during the Exam Finals.</p><p>"Ambitious," he commented, raising an eyebrow. "Most barriers have four corner tags, for stability purposes – and for range determination. Reducing that to a single seal will be different."</p><p>"I know," I said. "It's been slow going. At first I started trying to base it off my earth wall jutsu, but soil types have too much variability for it to work very well. So I'd either have to switch to another element or go with pure chakra. Wind would probably work best, since it's everywhere and doesn't change much, but I have no experience with wind jutsu and while it does <em> diverting</em> well, I don't know how it would handle straight out blocking…" Temari had used wind currents to deflect things fairly well, but that wasn't what I was <em> really</em> looking for.</p><p>Jiraiya helped, and we bounced ideas off each other for a while. "You thinking about going into R&amp;D?" he asked. "Because otherwise the Barrier Team might snap you up, if you manage this."</p><p>I shrugged, surprised at the question. "I don't know, I never really thought about it," I said honestly. There were a few Nara in R&amp;D, pharmacology division usually, but I wasn't really aiming for it.</p><p>"Really? Bright girl like you? You don't have any plans?"</p><p>Oh god, it was the <em> what do you want to do with your life</em> conversation. I'd <em> hated</em> this the first time around. At least now most people had accepted 'be a ninja' as an answer.</p><p>I hunched my shoulders a little. "I want to be a jounin," I murmured. I'd need to be strong, and while rank didn't <em> make</em> you strong, you had to be strong to get it.</p><p>That was the other answer people accepted.</p><p>"Being a generalist isn't a <em> bad</em> thing," Jiraiya said, softly. "But there are a lot of things the different teams and divisions can teach you. It's worth knowing what they all do, anyway."</p><p>I nodded. Regardless of what I was going to do, it was good advice.</p><p>I thought, perhaps, he was going to say something else, but then Jiraiya's eyes cut left, staring off into the distance, as though he were focusing on something that wasn't present. "Well that's excellent timing," he said quietly before raising his voice. "Sorry kids, you're on your own! Duty calls." He cackled and rubbed his hands together. "The ladies just can't wait for Jiraiya to show up!"</p><p>Naruto harrumphed. "We don't need you here, anyway!"</p><p>"Excellent! Now don't go getting yourself into trouble." He waggled a finger at us and vanished.</p><p>I frowned, just a little, and cast my senses out. I couldn't feel him anymore, couldn't feel <em> anyone</em> around us. That didn't mean no one was there, however. I was good at sensing, and even better at identifying what I sensed, but that didn't mean I was unbeatable. All techniques had counters, in the end.</p><p>"Just like him," Naruto muttered. "Showing up, not helping then leaving."</p><p>I looked down, guiltily, realising that I had basically monopolised Jiraiya's time. He'd been helping <em> me</em> not Naruto.</p><p>"Good riddance," Sasuke said, tone full of dismissal. "Now are you going to keep doing that, or do you want to do some <em> real</em> training?" He drew a handful of kunai, the meaning clear.</p><p>Naruto brightened. "Yeah! Shikako?"</p><p>I laughed. "I'll sit this one out. Supposed to be going light on the taijutsu and all that." I settled myself on top of one of the three training posts and watched.</p><p>It was interesting to watch them fight, and not have to worry about participating. Naruto was getting good at his replacement technique, using it to drop himself or his clones in to take advantage of openings. There was the kunai duplication trick, and replacing himself with a moving kunai and then duplicating it – which I had no doubt would one day give someone a nasty surprise.</p><p>Sasuke's taijutsu had always been good, but it was a surprising mishmash of styles and moves now. There was a strong influence of Lee's Strong Fist, and the Uchiha style he'd started off with, but also a smattering of other attacks and deflections that had to have been copied along the way. I was sure I spotted a move that had to have a Jyuuken basis – a curving open palmed swipe – used in a way that a true Jyuuken user never would have.</p><p>Eventually they wound down and stopped.</p><p>"So, lunch?" I suggested brightly. It would be a <em> late</em> lunch by now, but still. Food.</p><p>"Yeah!" Naruto cheered, bouncing back to his feet. "It's been <em> ages</em> since we went to Ichiraku together."</p><p>Sasuke rolled his eyes. "You never eat anything else, do you?" he asked rhetorically. But it was a friendly taunt and they bumped shoulders as we headed back to town.</p><p>We were barely out of the training fields when a shadow on the ground made me look up. A hawk was flying above us, winging across the sky with lazy loops.</p><p>The message it was carrying …</p><p><em> Sasuke Uchiha. Mission. Report to main gates ASAP.</em></p><p>I frowned.</p><p>"Aww, what? You get to go on a mission already?" Naruto groused. "That's so not fair! Why you, anyway? We should be going as a team!" He smacked his fists together.</p><p>"I don't like it," I said uneasily, exchanging glances with Sasuke. Not for the same reason that Naruto didn't, but it was suspicious. Jiraiya lets Sasuke out, vanishes, then he gets a mission request? By hawk, no less.</p><p>Sasuke nodded slowly. Ignoring a mission request was a very serious offence, but you <em> could</em> negotiate. You could <em> reject</em> missions, even, although it didn't happen very often. "To the mission desk?"</p><p>"I think we should at least verify it," I confirmed. "It doesn't seem right."</p><p>"You don't think it's a real mission?" Naruto asked, glancing upwards again. "That it's someone trying to get their hands on Sasuke again?" His eyes narrowed a fraction. "Orochimaru is really starting to piss me off."</p><p>"Join the club," Sasuke said dryly.</p><p>But we couldn't <em> get </em> to the Missions Desk.</p><p>"Sorry," the Chunin standing in front of the door said, slightly harried. "The Missions Desk is closed for the rest of the day. Please come back later."</p><p>Naruto started to argue that it was <em> really important</em> but I drew back, with Sasuke.</p><p>"What kind of thing makes the Mission Desk close?" he asked in an undertone.</p><p>It was a good point. Missions were the whole <em> point.</em> Come hell or high water, missions were assigned and carried out. And for that, someone needed to do the assigning.</p><p>"I don't know," I said, eyes narrowed. No missions meant … what? All the missions were done? Unlikely. Everyone was on a mission? That suggested some kind of wide scale assemblage and we <em> couldn't</em> have missed a signal for that. Could we?</p><p>"Whaddaya mean Baachan isn't here? Where is she then?" Naruto hollered, breaking my concentration. He huffed, turning away from the poor beleaguered door guard. "This sucks."</p><p>I nodded. "Let's go home," I suggested quietly. The Nara Clan compound was one of the safest places I knew. "Unless you want…"</p><p>Wanted to what? Go on the mission? Go and see who exactly was waiting for him by the gates? That could just be walking straight into an ambush. Try an investigate some more?</p><p>Sasuke ran a hand through his hair. "If this <em> is </em> a mission, I'm going to be in so much trouble," he muttered. "Sure. Let's go."</p><p>Naruto looked unusually serious. "Don't worry, Shikako-chan! If anyone shows up to try and take Sasuke again, we'll kick their asses just like we did before! Everything will be okay!"</p><p>"Of course it will be," I said. "As if we'd allow it to be any other way."</p><p>Home, it turned out, wasn't the bastion of serenity I'd imagined it was going to be. Mum was directing half a dozen clan members around, looking like a professional ninja, despite the pink dress and apron. "-the stock take done <em> immediately</em> so we can work out what was stolen," she was saying as we came into hearing range.</p><p>"What happened?" I asked, alarmed.</p><p>She hesitated a fraction on seeing me, but then her face hardened as she made a decision. "The outer research labs were attacked. I've sent word to the Hokage, but it seems like we weren't the only place hit. Your brother has already gone on ahead to scout and gather information."</p><p>I nearly gaped. "Was anyone hurt?"</p><p>"Emono and Kyoogi were knocked out, but they seem like they'll be okay," she replied, easing some of my tension. "I hate to ask, but could you go after your brother…"</p><p>"Of course," I said even before she'd finished. I would have suggested going myself, but I felt off balance. I didn't know what was going on, and someone had attacked <em> my home.</em></p><p>"Yeah, you can count on us!" Naruto said, a tad loudly. "We'll make sure that lazy slacker doesn't get in any trouble." He laughed awkwardly, rubbing the back of his head.</p><p>Sasuke looked about as tense as I felt.</p><p>Funny how an hour ago, today had been a good day.</p><p>I led the way, bouncing through the tree tops as we headed across the clan grounds towards the outer walls of Konoha. The outer labs were generally for experimentation, and were fairly isolated in case they needed to be evacuated and contained. They were only moderately hidden or defended, but it still implied someone had <em> known</em> where to look for them – and what to take.</p><p><em> Worrying.</em></p><p>Could this be related to Jiraiya vanishing – to Sasuke's mission? But <em> how?</em> Mum had implied we weren't the only ones attacked, so was there so kind of invasion force? I wish I'd asked, but if she'd known she would have said. An invasion didn't make sense, anyway, not for smash and grab thievery. Sure there were some dangerous or expensive chemicals and ingredients, but not in such quantities to make it worth the effort.</p><p>I shook my head. <em> Gotta focus. It's pointless wondering when you have no information. </em></p><p>"What's that?" Sasuke asked, distracting me.</p><p>"The research lab," I answered, jumping down to the ground. "Be careful what you touch." I could sense people down there, but one of them was Shikamaru, so I guessed that they'd come ahead with him.</p><p>"Hey Shikamaru! You there?" Naruto hollered. At least we weren't trying to go the stealthy route.</p><p>After a brief pause, Shikamaru emerged from out of the building, hands in his pockets and glaring lazily at Naruto. "Geeze, I think everyone in this half of Konoha heard you," he muttered. "You nearly gave the researchers a heart attack." He jerked a thumb over his shoulder, back at the building.</p><p>"What have you found?" I asked.</p><p>"Well," he drawled. "We have a list of what was taken, but hell if I know what they wanted it for. It's the most bizarre combination of ingredients; makes no sense."</p><p>I'd once told Ino that Shikamaru probably knew more about medicine than he'd care to admit and it was comments like these that made me suspect it. He wasn't <em> interested</em> in it at all, but Shikamaru wasn't interested in many things.</p><p>"Other than that," he continued. "They didn't exactly go overboard on the subtlety. You can probably tell which direction they went by yourself."</p><p>"They?" I asked. "You think there were multiple people."</p><p>Shikamaru scratched his chin and yawned. "Not inside. There'd have been more stuff moved if there had been several people looking for things. But there could have been accomplices waiting outside."</p><p>The building wasn't a big one either, and it was going to get crowded quickly if you started adding more people.</p><p>"Shoe prints indicate an adult male; definitely someone with shinobi training," Shikamaru added. "It's hard to tell more than that, unless you want to call for a full investigation."</p><p>"We'd probably have better luck following the trail," Sasuke said, eyeing the tree tops.</p><p>"Well if you insist," Shikamaru drawled, and I realised he'd been counting on the suggestion. "Wait for me to send these two back, and we can go after them."</p><p>And although Naruto looked impatient to be going, now that we'd decided, we waited for Shikamaru to finish giving orders to the two researchers that had come with him to assess the building. "Oh," he added, once he was done. "And tell my mother that I'm heading after the intruder with Team 7, would you?"</p><p>"She's not really going to be happy about this," I said, as we leapt into the trees.</p><p>Shikamaru shrugged. "You can head back."</p><p>I scoffed. "Yeah, right." After that, we were more focused on where we were going, because although we'd had training in pursuit, tracking by physical trails wasn't exactly a skill any of us excelled in. We were all sharp eyed and intelligent though, so spotting foot prints and bent branches wasn't impossible, given that there seemed to be no attempt at hiding them.</p><p>"Is he arrogant, or is it a trap?" I asked.</p><p>"Assume it's a trap," Shikamaru said. "That way we only get a pleasant surprise."</p><p>The trail wound through several training fields where we almost lost it, to the far, far outskirts of the village, before coming to a small unnoticeable cave wedged in the side of a hill. There were two very large men sitting just outside the entrance, eating.</p><p>"There's definitely someone in there," I breathed quietly, frowning. "It's- It's almost familiar…" I just couldn't quite put my finger on <em> why.</em> The two we could see weren't familiar at all.</p><p>Sasuke gave the handsign for retreat and we backed up into the forest.</p><p>"Why are we backing up?" Naruto hissed. "We've got them now."</p><p>"We should try and get some information first," I said, biting my lip. "We don't know <em> anything</em> about who they are or why they attacked the lab." <em> Or if they were involved with Orochimaru or if it was just a coincidence…</em></p><p>"And we don't know who's in the cave or what he's doing," Sasuke said. "If there's another exit, he might get away."</p><p>"Alright," Shikamaru said, unfolding his hands from where they'd been clasped. "Here's what we're going to do."</p><p>I was a little surprised that neither of the boys protested at taking orders from Shikamaru – but then, we <em> had</em> just done a mission with him, and once he started laying out the plan they seemed happy enough with it.</p><p>Actually, it was also a little surprising that Shikamaru was just… taking charge like this.</p><p>"Remember, we want to incapacitate them, so be careful," he cautioned. "Also, we don't know where the cave leads, or what's inside it, so the entering team will need to be wary of traps."</p><p>"We got it," Naruto said confidently. "These guys are going to regret messing with us."</p><p>Shikamaru sighed, looking like he was having second thoughts. "Alright then," he said. "Let's go."</p><p>Naruto sprung off several clones, one standing next to Shikamaru and Sasuke, the others circling through the trees to surround the clearing. The real Naruto and I nodded at each other and moved off, getting as close to the entrance as we could without losing cover.</p><p>The others waited for us to all get in position, then launched themselves into the clearing at speed, as if they had been racing through the tree tops.</p><p>The two large shinobi blinked placidly at them, still eating.</p><p>"Hah, we found you!" Naruto crowed.</p><p>"Look, brother," one of the shinobi said, voice drawn out. "There are people here."</p><p>"I see them, Fujin," said the other one. "Maybe they want to play a game with us?"</p><p>Naruto looked pretty dumbfounded at that lack of reaction. "Hey! I'm talking to you! What were you doing attacking the Nara Clan? And who are you, anyway?"</p><p>"We're Fujin and Raijin," the second shinobi – Raijin – said. "But we didn't attack anybody. There was no one to fight. It wasn't very fun. Hey, do you have any food? All of ours is gone, and I'm <em> hungry.</em> " He sounded plaintive, almost whining.</p><p>"You're seriously asking us for food?" Sasuke asked in disbelief.</p><p>"I don't think they have any food, brother," Fujin said, leaning over to talk to Raijin, but not actually whispering.</p><p>Raijin sighed and heaved himself to his feet. "Okay then, I guess we'll play. He did say we had to make sure no one disturbed him."</p><p>Fujin stood too. "Oh, boy. I hope it's fun."</p><p>"Hah! You think you can take us?" Naruto taunted. "You don't stand a chance!"</p><p>Raijin <em> disappeared </em> with a blur of speed, and Naruto's clone vanished into a puff of chakra smoke. Beside me, the real Naruto jerked, and nearly gave jumped into the fight. I put a hand on his arm and jerked my head towards the cave entrance, which was no longer blocked.</p><p>There were more clones ready to help, and Sasuke and Shikamaru were <em> excellent</em> fighters. That didn't stop the surge of worry, but they'd be okay. I hoped.</p><p>"That wasn't very fun," Raijin said, sadly. Sasuke drew a handful of shuriken, and Shikamaru had his hands clasped in a rat seal, shadow forming around his feet.</p><p>We waited a second, to ensure their attention was focused on the fight that was breaking out, then edged our way carefully to the cave. We had to move quickly, but carefully, which was difficult as one usually traded off for the other. The inside was dim, light reaching only the first part of the tunnel, which sloped down sharply. The floor was rocky and uneven, and I summoned chakra to my hands to illuminate our path, once I was sure we wouldn't be seen from the outside.</p><p>I couldn't sense any chakra in the tunnel, and we didn't see any traps as we edged forwards.</p><p>Eventually, we saw flickering light up coming from further in and I doused my own chakra light with a look at Naruto. This was it then.</p><p>We edged forwards in the half light, trying to see what was ahead of us before we revealed ourselves, but the tunnels were – by either fate or design – laid in such a way that the advantage was to those inside. We could see what looked like a workroom, with some metal table in the centre and various things bolted to the walls. There was a person, male, tall, with long hair of pale colour. It was difficult to tell in the low light, but I thought it might be silver.</p><p>"So Fujin and Raijin failed, I see," he said, calling out to us. He sounded mostly annoyed, rather than worried. "Did they get distracted by their stomachs?"</p><p>"Maybe I'm just that awesome," Naruto boasted with a sharp grin as he stepped into the room.</p><p>I hung back, blending against the wall. He hadn't sounded like he knew <em> who</em> was there, so I wasn't going to reveal myself if I could retain the advantage of secrecy. I wasn't exactly hiding - there wasn't room for it – more just being unobtrusive and not drawing attention.</p><p>"You!" The person snarled, turning away from the workbench in the middle of the room. "Of all the people."</p><p>"Mizuki," Naruto said, surprised, before narrowing his eyes. "Didn't you learn your lesson about stealing things the first time?"</p><p><em> Mizuki-sensei?</em> Well that explained the vague familiarity. You'd think I'd remember a man who taught us for years a bit more. Then again, I already knew that rapid changes in personality could influence what your chakra was like and betraying your village was a pretty big change, even if you'd been thinking about it for a while.</p><p>But what was Mizuki doing here anyway? He'd tried to steal the Forbidden Scroll; they wouldn't have just let him walk away after that. I was, well, frankly a little stunned that he had survived at all. Surely he would at least be imprisoned somewhere.</p><p>Mizuki glared. "The only reason I was defeated in our last meeting was because I underestimated that conniving demon fox."</p><p>Naruto scoffed. "That had nothing to do with the fox. <em> That</em> was all me. I don't need Kyuubi to deal with someone like <em> you.</em> "</p><p>Mizuki looked, well, furious. "Don't lie! It's pathetic you made Genin; they should have stomped you out when you were born. I see you're wearing a Chunin vest, too. Who did you steal that from? Or did dear Iruka give that to you too?"</p><p>"I earned <em> this</em> all by myself," Naruto shot back. "So you can just stuff it."</p><p>"This pathetic village. How many times did I try? And <em> you</em> they just hand it to." His lips curled in disgust. "This place, it's always the same. No matter how many missions I took, how many high class enemies I defeated, they never looked at me with respect. Always looking down on me, always <em> judging.</em> "</p><p>Naruto was an empathetic person. But there was no way he was going to sympathise with that. Not when his own resolve was to make people acknowledge him. "So what?" Naruto asked aggressively. "You turned on them? Betrayed your own friends, tried to hurt Iruka-sensei? That's not the kind of person that <em> deserves </em> respect!"</p><p>"Iruka was the worst," Mizuki said dismissively. "He was no one. Nothing. Always goofing off in class and failing his tests. He wouldn't have even passed if it wasn't for me. And yet, <em> he</em> was the one the Third Hokage took an interest in. He was the one that gained all the attention, all the praise."</p><p>"Don't talk about Iruka-sensei like that!" Naruto clenched his fists.</p><p>He was goading Naruto, that was clear. He had to have some kind of plan, because he <em> knew</em> that Naruto was strong. I couldn't see any traps. And I was looking.</p><p>"They'll see. When I have the power Orochimaru gave me, then they'll see." He grabbed a flask of red liquid off the workbench behind him and pulled the top off.</p><p>"Orochimaru! So you are working with him. Well, we beat the last guys he sent, and we'll beat you too!" Naruto shouted. "That old snake face can just get lost."</p><p>Whatever Mizuki was doing, I didn't like it. I hesitated for a second, then decided that we probably had all the information we were going to get. He <em> drank</em> the liquid and threw the flask away, even as my shadow snared his feet.</p><p>"See my strength!" He boasted, laughing. "<em> This</em> is what Orochimaru gave me. I'll bring him what he desires, and I will be rewarded<em> .</em> "</p><p>The ground shook, suddenly, as though something had impacted heavily on the ground above us. I felt a flash of worry for Shikamaru and Sasuke. Then again, things might not be going so well for us, either. Mizuki's chakra was growing, and livid red marks reminiscent of the curse seal activating were spreading across his skin. His muscles – already larger and more defined than I remembered – were bulging. I could feel him pushing against the possession jutsu, the movements echoing in my own limbs.</p><p>"Naruto-!" I shouted, warning cut off. Because if the curse seal had boosted the strength of the Sound Four enough that they could break the Shadow Possession Jutsu, then I wasn't going to count on it holding now. <em> Why</em> did we always seem to run into people who could break it?</p><p>Naruto had lunged at Mizuki as soon almost the same time I had started attacking, knowing the same way I did that nothing good could come of this. People taking supplements in the middle of a fight <em> never</em> lead to anything good.</p><p>Naruto formed three clones while in motion, leading in with an agile taijutsu combination attack. I dropped my jutsu the second before they hit, not wanting to get the reflected effects, and judging that as a tactic, Shadow Possession wasn't really working anyway.</p><p>With a shout, the red marks settled into black stripes and Mizuki broke free, lashing out with impossible speed to destroy the clones and slam Naruto into the wall. Rocks and dust exploded out from where he'd hit, clouding the air, and I shut my eyes tight against it.</p><p>I released my weight seal, zigzagged left out of the tunnel and into the room, as something impacted where I had just been, <em> Naruto</em> and <em> Mizuki</em> shining chakra bright in my head and burning away anything else. Mizuki's chakra was drawn in lines, moving too <em> fast</em> to sense it proper – <em> no </em> way<em> , how could he, how fast is that</em> - to where I had been, then back to Naruto, circling around the room. I ducked, rolled under the huge heavy worktable, and slung two kunai to opposite walls, a trip line of ninja wire strung between them.</p><p>It didn't matter if he was fast. He was still running.</p><p>Naruto hauled himself out of the wall, more clones popping into existence around him. They puffed out almost as soon as they were created, victims of Mizuki's sudden speed, and the chakra smoke was almost as obscuring as the dust had been.</p><p>But the fact that all Mizuki was popping was <em> clones…</em></p><p>"Your movements are so slow," Mizuki boasted, "it doesn't matter how many of you there are now – not one of you will be able to touch me."</p><p>"Guess again, asshole," Naruto growled from where he was crouched on the ceiling. He had a handful of kunai splayed between his fingers and he hurled them downwards. "<em> Now!"</em></p><p>One became many, and I was glad that I was currently underneath something.</p><p>Mizuki had been prepared to block a handful, but not the <em> dozens</em> of kunai he faced, and he jumped backwards changing tactics to avoid them at the last moment. Something heavy hit my trip line, snapping the taunt wire and yanking the kunai full out of the walls. He tumbled backwards, arms crossing over his face to protect it and taking the brunt of Naruto's kunai duplication attack.</p><p>I doubted it had seriously injured him, not with the amount of chakra he was using to reinforce his body. But it was an attack that had succeeded which said to me, that no matter what that potion did, it didn't put him in the league of the Sound Four. Whether it wasn't as strong, or whether it was simply because he had never used it before, didn't matter.</p><p>"Lightning Release; Striking Bolt!" I commanded, arm thrown out in his direction.</p><p>The sudden light in the dimness of the bunker seared my retinas, and through the afterimages I saw a horde of Naruto's leaping down to dogpile our ex-teacher.</p><p>I rolled out from under the table, panting at the sudden exertion. There had been no gentle entrance into the fight here; it had been <em> sudden.</em></p><p>"Earth Release: Earth-Style Prison!" I continued, slapping my hands down on the ground. Four slabs of stone rose out of the ground, slamming together over top of him. I grimaced at the result – a little lopsided, and I was certain that the left wall was weaker than the other three. Earth-Style Prison was a basic adaption of the Earth-Style Wall, only with more parts to it, which meant it took much more concentration. It was doubly hard, right now, because I was trying to manipulate actual <em> stone</em> not just dirt and took a larger chunk of chakra than I wanted to lose.</p><p>But what else could I do? Explosions were right out; I'd bring that cave down on our heads. There wasn't <em> room</em> in here for anything that required manoeuvring. I might be able to slow him down if I managed to catch him with Shadow Possession again – if, if, if – but then we'd still need to do something to take him down. I briefly wished I had my lightsaber. Not because I thought I could use it or it would help or anything. I just kind of wanted it.</p><p>Naruto was still perched on the roof, eyes fastened on the stone prison. A clone beside him was helping him form a Rasengan in one hand.</p><p><em> Well. That would do it.</em></p><p>I was a little surprised that Naruto was willing to escalate to Rasengan so quickly, but he <em> had</em> fought Mizuki before, and we didn't really want to be messing around with some curse seal type ability. The last ones had been dangerous enough.</p><p>The stone prison shuddered and fractured, an arm bursting out of the side. The left, of course. The black stripes winding around the limb had gone red again, writing furiously over all the exposed skin.</p><p>"You insignificant <em> fools!"</em> Mizuki bellowed, bursting free. "I will <em> destroy</em> you!" He sounded more than slightly unhinged. He was starting to look animalistic where the Sound Four had been demonic, though the difference was slight.</p><p>I was ready for him, my shadow latching onto his. It was a struggle, and I was distracting him more than anything. Overpowering him wasn't going to work, but if I could make him focus his attention on me…</p><p>"Rasengan!" Naruto called, hurtling downwards, arm outstretched to thrust the jutsu forward. It ploughed into Mizuki, and I dropped the Shadow Possession, letting it drive him backwards.</p><p>"Impossible-!" Mizuki gasped out.</p><p>Then he fell silent.</p><p>I wasted no time in jumping through the debris and slapping a knockout seal on him, though it was doubtful it was needed at this time. He was still alive, which said something for his strength, but getting hit with Rasengan tended to mess things up. Big time.</p><p>"Well," I said. "That… led to more questions than it answered, really."</p><p>Orochimaru was involved. How did Mizuki fit in with him? How was Mizuki here? Where had he come from? The missing ingredients had probably formed that proto-curse seal concoction, but how had he known to make it? Was this lab one of Orochimaru's?</p><p>I shook my head. There were no answers to be found here. "Let's get back to the others."</p><p>Naruto shook his head, as though chasing away heavy thoughts. "They're doing okay," he said, a reminder that he had clones in that fight too. But he summoned up a medium sized toad – about the height of our knees – and jerked his thumb at Mizuki. "Hey, Gamanidai. Got a prisoner to take back to the village. Can you help me out?"</p><p>"Another one?" the toad grumbled. "I just got the taste of the last one out of my mouth." But it hopped forward, and then its mouth <em> stretched</em> , larger than should have been possible, a quick yank of its tongue pulling Mizuki's body in.</p><p>"Thanks," Naruto said, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly. "I owe you."</p><p>We picked our way through the rubble and back down the tunnel, homing in on Shikamaru and Sasuke's fight. Like Naruto had said, by now they had things mostly handled, though there were signs that it hadn't been quite so easy earlier. There was snapped ninja wire dangling in the breeze, and the top of one tree top was smouldering gently.</p><p>Shikamaru had both of them in Shadow Possession, and they were wrapped firmly in ninja wire besides, with solid shadow hands clasped over their noses and mouths. They were both teetering on the edge of unconsciousness, and their remaining struggles were weak.</p><p><em> It doesn't matter how strong they are, they still need to breathe. </em></p><p>Sasuke was staring at them both, Sharingan spinning slowly, though I couldn't tell if there was genjutsu involved, or if he was just wary of an attack.</p><p>I joined my shadow to Shikamaru's to help hold the Possession while he focused on the Shadow Neck-Binding Jutsu. I was deeply impressed that he was managing to do both jutsu at once, on multiple opponents. Multitasking like that was closer to a Jounin level skill than a Chunin one.</p><p>Then they dropped. And that was that.</p><p>"So, did you find him?" Shikamaru asked, straightening from his crouch and popping his back.</p><p>"Yeah," I said. "Mizuki-sensei. Apparently he's working for Orochimaru now."</p><p>Shikamaru's eyebrow shot up, but Sasuke looked at me incredulously. Right. Obviously he hadn't actually heard the story of how Naruto graduated. I shrugged.</p><p>"So… Orochimaru sent our ex-teacher to rob our clan because…" Shikamaru drawled.</p><p>"He made some kind of super chakra potion," Naruto said. "It made him heaps faster and stronger."</p><p>"So the ingredients weren't the end goal," Shikamaru sighed. "Troublesome."</p><p>Because that lead to the question of what <em> was</em> the end goal, which we had zero chance of answering right now.</p><p>Naruto's transport toad swallowed the two brothers and we started heading back towards the Hokage's Tower. Carefully. There was no way of telling if they had had <em> other</em> accomplices.</p><p>We were about halfway back when we ran into Iruka-sensei and a female Jounin that I didn't recognise. "Are you kids okay? You really shouldn't be out here alone. There's been a break out from the Konoha Secure Correctional Facility; we're still rounding up the prisoners."</p><p>"A breakout?" I said. "Huh. That makes more sense now."</p><p>A bit. Anyway. Mizuki was supposed to be in prison – and working for Orochimaru might have explained why they were keeping him around. If there had been other attacks, that would be the other prisoners. It <em> didn't</em> explain how he got free or what he was intending to do, but it answered some questions.</p><p>"We ran into some people," Sasuke said, bored. "Two brothers named Fujin and Raijin, and Mizuki."</p><p>The lady Jounin gasped. "That's them," she said softly. "The Legendary Stupid Brothers."</p><p>The title tumbled over in my head, clicking with the names. They had a bingo book page, but I hadn't connected it with them because they were listed as inactive. They were supposed to be really strong, but, well, stupid. They'd frequently attacked teammates over things like food and had simply gotten uncontrollable.</p><p>"Are you all okay?" Iruka asked, sounding a little horrified.</p><p>It made me wonder, just a little, how up to date Iruka-sensei was on our adventures. Because in hindsight, this had been pretty easy so far, even if we hadn't known what we were getting ourselves into.</p><p>"Of course we're okay!" Naruto protested. "It'll take more than stupid Mizuki-sensei to take me out! I showed that last time, didn't I?"</p><p>"Please, where was he? I need to find him," the woman said, eyes creasing with worry. "He's about to do something terrible."</p><p>"It's a bit late for that," Shikamaru drawled.</p><p>"Yeah, he already attacked the Nara clan and stuff," Naruto added. "But don't worry! We caught them." He paused. "Who are you anyway, lady?"</p><p>"I'm Tsubaki," she said softly. "Mizuki was my…" she faltered, trailing off.</p><p>Naruto huffed and crossed his arms. "Then he's even <em> more</em> of an idiot for trying to leave."</p><p>I know that Naruto meant it as 'if he had so many precious people that cared so much for him' but it did make my lips twitch in amusement. <em> Really,</em> Naruto.</p><p>"Wait, you caught them?" Iruka-sensei asked, a little baffled.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, Gamanidai has them," Naruto said impatiently. "We gotta go hand them in. <em> And</em> we still gotta go talk to Baa-chan about Sasuke's… thing." He caught himself at the last moment. "Do you know where everyone is? We went to the Mission Desk before but it was shut."</p><p>"Yes, we were coordinating the recapture of the criminals," Iruka explained. "It was a big mess, so we had to get it done quickly. I'm surprised you didn't hear about it."</p><p>It <em> was</em> a little surprising. I would have thought there would have been alarms or something. The training fields weren't <em> that</em> out of the way.</p><p>We made it back to the village proper with no other interruptions. Tsunade, back from wherever she had been, was standing in outside of the tower.</p><p>"Iruka. Status report?" she asked.</p><p>"Mizuki, Fujin and Raijin have been apprehended, Hokage-sama," Iruka-sensei reported. "Team Tenchi is currently in pursuit of Hankou and Zenka; that's the last of them."</p><p>Tsunade relaxed half a fraction. "Good. We need to get this mess cleaned up." Her eyes flickered to us. "Now what do you brats want?"</p><p>"We were looking for you!" Naruto complained.</p><p>Tsunade groaned, hand coming up to pinch the bridge of her nose. "You three are like Lucky Sevens," she said. "When you turn up, I just know things are about to go to hell." She sighed. "Alright, hit me with it."</p><p>That was mixing metaphors a little, but the point was clear. I couldn't even say she was exactly <em> wrong.</em></p><p>"It's about the mission I was assigned," Sasuke said quietly, stepping forward a little.</p><p>The look on Tsunade's face very clearly said 'what mission'. "My office," she directed. "Tsubaki, take the prisoners back to the Correctional Facility. Iruka, keep coordinating the response. And get Izumo and Kotetsu to report back on the causes of the breakout."</p><p>The two saluted and went on their way, a hand gesture from Naruto making Gamanidai follow.</p><p>Tsunade's office wasn't empty when we got there, though. Jiraiya was there, unconscious and bound form of Tayuya slung over one shoulder. There was <em> something</em> in his hand, but it vanished out of our sight rapidly.</p><p><em> Why Tayuya? Did she get out as well? The others? Was she the goal-</em> The thoughts tumbled through my head rapidly. <em> They were after Sasuke – he got out this morning – coincidence - prison break - </em></p><p>"- a messenger hawk bearing instructions for a priority mission," Sasuke was explaining to Tsunade as I tuned back in. "It seemed… suspicious, so we came to the Tower to confirm it, but there wasn't an opportunity."</p><p>Tsunade leant on her desk. "Well at least you have some sense," she mused, tapping her long painted fingernails on the wood. The narrowed look in her eyes suggested she was going through a list of how many people had access to the hawks or could disguise one as an official Konoha hawk. "That was not assigned by me. In fact, from this point on, you will take no missions unless they are given to you by me personally. No mission scrolls, no messengers, nothing. If it doesn't come from my mouth, you don't take it."</p><p>Sasuke nodded silently.</p><p>"The same goes for Naruto," Tsunade decided. "We don't want to have to repeat this."</p><p>"Yeah, sure," Naruto shrugged. It didn't make much difference to him, since our missions usually were assigned by Tsunade anyway. "But what's this all about, anyway? How come the pervy sage has that Sound chick?"</p><p>"While everyone else was busy running around catching the Correctional Facility prisoners, there was a bit of a break in where these guys were being kept as well," Jiraiya said lightly.</p><p><em> Someone tried to get Sasuke out of the village; the Konoha Secure Correctional Facility had all the prisoners escape; wherever Tayuya was being held (T&amp;I?) had a break in...</em></p><p>They were all connected by Orochimaru. That much was obvious. But how? Why now?</p><p>Something flickered across my mind. <em> Naruto, running through the streets, </em> <em> "The pervy sage said that they were letting Sasuke out today."</em></p><p>No.</p><p>"<em> I'll bring Orochimaru what he desires-"</em></p><p>No.</p><p>I could feel my face settle into hard lines.</p><p>I had thought if they were letting Sasuke out, then the problem had been dealt with. But letting Sasuke out was an attempt to deal with the problem. He was bait.</p><p>And they hadn't even told us.</p><p>I would have said something, but I couldn't force the words out. I felt… I felt angry.</p><p>"Don't get upset, kid," Jiraiya said, looking directly at me. "You were all perfectly safe." He made a motion with his hand and a tiny frog – the size of a <em> normal</em> frog – hopped in through the window as if it had been just outside. Unnervingly, I hadn't been able to sense it. I <em> still</em> couldn't sense it, even though I could see it with my eyes. "If you were in any danger, Gamatate would have swallowed you and unsummoned back to Mount Myoboku. Nothing would be able to reach you there."</p><p>"Wait, what?" Naruto asked, confused.</p><p>Jiraiya and Tsunade communicated with a look.</p><p>"There are a lot of things going on in Konoha that you don't need to be concerned about," Tsunade said. "But despite our best efforts, it does appear that Orochimaru still has supporters in the village. Interrogation of the prisoners has been … enlightening, but is taking time. They have strong wills and aren't going to give up classified information easily. It simply wasn't feasible to keep Sasuke in a secure location until the situation was dealt with, so, we let him out."</p><p>"And the breakouts are because of that?" Sasuke asked, putting things together.</p><p>"We knew they would make a move," Tsunade acknowledged. "Several of the more… ambitious prisoners appear to have been offered a place with Orochimaru if they brought you to him. The messenger hawk was probably another move to get to you."</p><p>"There were three of the Sound Four captured," Shikamaru murmured. "If you have only one, did the others get away? Or were they just taken out before they could be interrogated?"</p><p>"It looks like it was intended that way," Jiraiya confirmed. "Tayuya managed to slip away for a bit – it looks like she wanted revenge for being defeated – but we were expecting this. Everything was contained."</p><p>Shikamaru paled and mouthed 'Chouji'.</p><p>"Did we learn anything?" Tsunade asked, wearily.</p><p>"I think this is all they need to know," Jiraiya said. "Get one of your ANBU to take her back and I'll fill you in on the rest."</p><p>Tsunade nodded. "You four, dismissed."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Sidestories has 2 new chapters up, as well.

			<h2>Stones of Gelel Arc: Chapter 66</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: So a couple of people have pointed out that there are plagiarized versions of DOS out there. Come on, guys, not cool. I don't mind inspiring people, I don't mind people deciding to write a SI, or 'hey that sealing concept/jutsu/world building was cool, I want to use it', but taking huge chunks and changing the names isn't on.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 66</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> If you are out of trouble, watch for danger ~ Sophocles</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Shikamaru bolted for the hospital almost as soon as we hit the streets.</p><p>"I'll see you tomorrow," I said to Naruto and Sasuke hastily. "Stay out of trouble!" After everything that had happened today, I didn't want for there to be any more surprises.</p><p>Then I took off after Shikamaru with a groan. I'd done a lot more exercise today than I had since the mission, and I knew I was going to be paying for it.</p><p>I wasn't panicking, though, even if they'd just dangled us like bait, I didn't believe that Jiraiya and Tsunade would be quite so blasé if Chouji had been hurt. They would have <em> said.</em></p><p>The hospital let us know that Chouji had indeed been signed out, just as planned, and had gone home. He hadn't been injured any further.</p><p>Shikamaru sagged at the news, some of the frantic energy leeching out of him. He thanked the receptionist tiredly, and headed back outside, scuffing a hand through his hair.</p><p>"He's okay," I said quietly. "Tsunade and Jiraiya would have said if anything had happened."</p><p>"Pretty trusting for someone that was really angry at them a minute ago," Shikamaru said wearily.</p><p>"Yeah, I-" My voice caught uncomfortably, rasping a little as residual anger pulled my throat tight. "I don't like what they did. But I also don't think they did it carelessly. I wish they'd <em> told</em> us, more than anything…" It wasn't like we wouldn't have gone through with it. Sasuke had already played bait once, and it would have been a lot less nerve wracking if we'd known what was going on.</p><p><em> Secrets. Everything is always layered in secrets. </em></p><p>But wishing for the past to change never helped anything. It was done. Move on.</p><p>"Come on," I said instead. "Let's go see him."</p><p>Shikamaru shoved his hands in his pockets. "This is not the kind of exciting I wanted in my life," he complained.</p><p>"You didn't want <em> any</em> kind of exciting in your life," I shot back easily.</p><p>"And the more I see, the more justified I feel about that decision."</p><p>I laughed and we headed towards the Akimichi Clan grounds with a slightly more casual pace. The Akimichi place always felt really <em> busy</em> in a way that the Nara grounds never really managed, with less empty forest and more buildings crowded together. Well, I say the 'Akimichi Clan grounds' but they didn't have a sharply delineated area that they all stayed in; houses and shops spilled out into the village and you could find Akimichi owned restaurants clear on the other side of Konoha.</p><p>Shikamaru knocked briskly on the door, and within minutes we were welcomed by Chouji's mother ushering us inside and tutting about getting us something to eat because we were far too thin, poor dears.</p><p>It was the exact same refrain we were met with every time that we visited their house, and it was soothing in its familiarity. I guess when you were an Akimichi, everyone seemed too thin.</p><p>Ino, to my surprise, was settled at the kitchen table across from Chouji, nursing a cup of tea and politely taking very small bites of food.</p><p>"Hey," Shikamaru said quietly. "Heard you had a bit of trouble earlier."</p><p>"Tch," Ino replied. "It figures that trying to go anywhere with one of you boys winds up with us in trouble." Her smile was kind of wan and strained though.</p><p>"You were there?" I asked, as we took a seat.</p><p>Ino nodded. "Yeah, we were just signing out when that Sound girl burst through the front doors waving a sword around. Chouji, being the big hero that he is," she teased, "went to go and wrestle it off her before she could hurt anyone, and then Sakura hit her over the head with a vase. It was all over very fast."</p><p>Lacking from that story was any description of what <em> Ino</em> had done and Ino usually wasn't shy tell tales about her exploits.</p><p>"Are you okay?" I asked.</p><p>"Fine," Ino said, waving it off with a light laugh that was so obviously fake. There was a long pause when none of us said anything. "Really," she insisted. "I didn't get hurt or anything. I just… froze. Sorry, Chouji. I just… couldn't follow through. I had it all lined up and ready and I just couldn't do it."</p><p>"It's okay," Chouji said. "Everything worked out alright." For Chouji, that was enough to make things okay. Even though he'd had to take the pills, nearly wrecked his body and been unable to continue as a ninja, even though they'd been attacked <em> again</em> , everything was okay <em> now</em> and that was enough.</p><p>"We had to get saved by Sakura," Ino said. "Sakura. She's not even-"</p><p><em> A ninja,</em> hovered in the air unsaid.</p><p>Ino had the grace to look ashamed. "I didn't mean that."</p><p>"Sorry we weren't there," Shikamaru said. "If I'd known, I would have come with you." It was irrational; there was no way he could have known beforehand. That didn't make the desire any less truthful.</p><p>"Tch, slacker. I bet you were busy watching clouds or something."</p><p>"We ran into a few troubles of our own," I said, wryly. "Seems like it was the day for it.</p><p>"Are you both alright?" Chouji asked. "You didn't get hurt or anything did you?"</p><p>Ino's expression mirrored his worry.</p><p>"Yeah, fine," Shikamaru said. He rolled his neck, the vertebra clicking. "Naruto and Sasuke were with us. It was troublesome."</p><p>"What happened?" Ino asked.</p><p>"There was a prison break," I said with a shrug. "We ran into a few of the escapees. They attacked one of the clan labs for some drugs and stuff." It was a slightly less than elegant summation of the situation, but it would do.</p><p>"Crazy," Ino said, voice dropping in volume just a little. "Makes you wonder just how safe this place is, sometimes, doesn't it?"</p><p>"The safest place in the world is always going to be where we can watch each other's backs," I said. I couldn't exactly reassure them that 'no, Konoha is perfectly safe' but neither did I want to push the idea that it <em> wasn't</em> .</p><p><em> I</em> didn't really want to believe that Konoha wasn't safe.</p><p>It was… sad to see them breaking the childish faith that <em> home</em> was the same as <em> safe</em> . As ninja, it probably wasn't a bad thing to move on past that, but it was still… something of a loss.</p><p>Eventually, no matter how cosy it was here, we had to go. With absolutely no discussion on the matter whatsoever, Shika and I ended up walking Ino home. It just happened, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>When we reached her house though, she paused and took a steading breath. "I'll meet you at the training fields tomorrow," she said, waving a finger in Shikamaru's face. "Don't be late! I need someone to use for target practice."</p><p>Shikamaru groaned. "Troublesome."</p><p>"I mean it!"</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, I'll be there," Shikamaru grumbled. "Can't you use 'kako?"</p><p>Yeah, no. Bad idea if I'd ever heard one. "Sorry," I said as apologetically as I could manage. "Team training."</p><p>"Not too much, I hope," Shikamaru said, eyes cutting sideways at me. "You haven't done much clan training lately."</p><p>Was… was Shika scolding me for slacking off at training? What bizarre backwards world had I stumbled into?</p><p>He was right, though. With so many different options open to me, my progress in any <em> one</em> of them was less than it could be. And I had been neglecting my clan training. Justifying it as dad not being here clearly wasn't going to work, if Shikamaru had managed to find someone to supervise him.</p><p>"Yeah," I said. "I'll work on that."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Nara," Tsunade said as we stood arrayed in front of her desk. It wasn't the first time we'd come looking for work since Sasuke had been let out, and there were always D-ranks to be done. "How's your arm?"</p><p>"Ah, fine," I said, taken aback by the question a bit. "I've been cleared by medical." I was still doing exercises with it, but I'd already proven that I could fight and form handseals.</p><p>Tsunade nodded as if that was just confirmation for a decision she'd already made. "Alright then. I hate to do this, but I'm splitting you up-"</p><p>She didn't even manage to finish her sentence before Naruto exploded. "What? Why? Baa-chan, we're a team! You can't split us up!"</p><p>On his other side, Sasuke was drawn as tight as a bowstring, tension clear in the line of his shoulders.</p><p>"Quiet!" Tsunade slapped the desk, the smack of her hand like a whipcrack. "It's not permanent. But having the two of you cooling your heels just because your teammate can't leave the village does no one any good. I'm not breaking you up forever, but sometimes it will be necessary to work with other people and you're going to have to accept that. Understand?"</p><p>Naruto looked like he had bitten a lemon, face scrunched up and hands curled into half fists at his sides. "I don't like it," he muttered.</p><p>"You don't have to like it," Tsunade said, unsympathetically. "You just have to understand it. And if you can't see the reasons for it, then maybe I made the wrong call giving you that vest."</p><p>I winced a little. That was … harsh.</p><p>"What's going to happen?" Sasuke asked, voice inflectionless.</p><p>"I'm putting you on the patrol roster," Tsunade said. "You'll be paired with either one of the Jounin or one of the Special Jounin for safety, but don't expect them to go easy on you. They're there to do their jobs, not to babysit you."</p><p>Something eased in him, a little, at the directions. Probably at the realisation that he was still going to be doing <em> something</em> even if patrol duty wasn't exactly glamorous. Then again, maybe I was reading too much into it. Both Sasuke had been on missions with Team Gai while Naruto was looking for Tsunade, so he was more familiar with the idea than the rest of us.</p><p>"And us?" I asked cautiously.</p><p>"C-rank. Low risk," she said crisply. "You've been hired to locate a pet ferret that was lost around Kawara-gai and deliver it to Mizugiwa. Including travel, it shouldn't take more than a week."</p><p>I blinked, a little bit stunned. When they said that D-rank missions prepared you for actual missions, I'd rather thought about it as 'applicable skills' not that people <em> actually</em> still hired you to find lost pets. And, actually, 'around Kawara-gai'? Finding Tora in Konoha had been tricky, finding a specific ferret in an open portion of countryside sounded insane.</p><p>"As for your third squad member…" She trailed off, tapping her fingernails on the desk thoughtfully.</p><p>"Hinata?" I suggested hopefully. Having the Byakugan would be incredibly handy in this situation.</p><p>Tsunade shook her head almost immediately. "Unavailable. Take Shikamaru. Two Chunin should be enough to handle this."</p><p>She threw the mission scroll at us, directing Sasuke to report in and get his schedule, and we left.</p><p>"I hate this," Naruto muttered, scuffing his toe on the ground. "It sucks."</p><p>"Don't tell me you didn't expect it," Sasuke said, crossing his arms. "It's been coming since before we went to the Land of Snow."</p><p>Since Kajika and finding out that Orochimaru knew what missions we were on. Since the Chunin Exam, maybe, and Sasuke had become a target.</p><p>"It's not so bad," I tried. "There are plenty of positions within the village. And you'll have a lot of time for training." Of course, you could pretty much rule out anything sensitive, if he was carrying Orochimaru around on his neck. I wasn't sure how much that left, actually, but hopefully there was enough to keep him occupied.</p><p>"And Baa-chan said it wasn't permanent," Naruto chimed in, perking up a bit. "So it's probably just this once. We're still a team and nothing is going to change that, believe it!"</p><p>Sasuke and I exchanged looks because it probably wasn't going to be 'just once' but … I could believe in the rest of it.</p><p>"You better go," Sasuke said. "You've got a mission to do."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Kawara-gai was a small town, close to the border of Land of Rivers, which separated Fire and Wind. It was a decent distance from the village, even travelling through the trees but we were fairly light-hearted about it. We were as alert as always – because it <em> was</em> a mission – but I had my stress ball in hand and Shikamaru was stringing shadow tendrils through his fingers like a cat's cradle, and Naruto was rambling away about nothing in particular.</p><p>"So what's the plan?" I asked, unfolding the map as we set up camp for the night. We were at least half a day away still, but we didn't have a clear destination.</p><p>Shikamaru yawned, lacing his fingers behind his head and leaning back. "What do you know about ferrets?"</p><p>I shrugged. "They're mustelids, like weasels. About the size of a domestic cat. They're obligate carnivores and hunt pretty much anything – birds, rabbits, rats. They're crepuscular. They tend to burrow. A group of ferrets is called a 'business'." That last one was probably irrelevant.</p><p>Naruto snickered.</p><p>"Does that help us?" Shikamaru drawled.</p><p>"Depends," I shrugged. "Being crepuscular means the best time to look for it would be dawn and dusk, because that's when it's going to be active. If we needed to bait a trap, we'd use meat or maybe eggs… If it's a pet it might be used to eating other things though. If it can chase down a rabbit, it has to be pretty fast, so it could have covered a lot of ground between when it was lost and now."</p><p>Naruto nodded sagely, but I was pretty sure that he wouldn't have considered any of that. "If it's a pet, it might just have stayed at the town, right?" he suggested. "Because it's used to people."</p><p>"Maybe," I said. "It couldn't hurt to start their anyway. Kawara-gai is the closest thing we have to a centre point. While searching outside-in reduces the chance of missing it, there's only three of us and a lot of ground to cover." We could change that with shadow clones, but it was still a big area.</p><p>It was like a needle in a haystack. A moving needle.</p><p>We made it to Kawara-gai about midday and set about asking the townspeople if they had seen our ferret. Three kids looking for a lost pet wasn't exactly unusual – although there was no <em> real</em> reason to hide the fact we were ninja – but we didn't really get anywhere until we started knocking on doors on some of the outer lying farms.</p><p>"Might have seen one this morning," one farmer said reticently. "Could have been a stoat though. Didn't really get a close look at it."</p><p>It was better than anything we'd had so far, so we thanked him and started spreading out to check the area. We drew up a search grid and started combing through it, Naruto clones filling out the lines. We weren't particularly subtle about it, and we stirred countless rabbits out of the undergrowth as we checked burrows and dens.</p><p>"I think I see it," the Naruto who was next in the chain to me said, suddenly. I cast my eyes around, following the direction of his gaze, but couldn't see anything. "Ah, not me-me. Another me. That way!"</p><p>"Right," I said, feeling a little silly. "Could you take over my spot?" I took off in the direction he had pointed, ducking down the line of clones until one waved me over.</p><p>"Looks like the right markings," Shikamaru said as I got closer. He and Naruto were crouched in a tree, looking down on a ferret gambolling in the grass below. I landed nimbly on the branch beside them.</p><p>"Right," I agreed, then paused cocking my head to the side and frowning. "Do you hear that?"</p><p>It was… very faint. Just at the edge of hearing. A … humming, whistling sound, almost. It could have just been tinnitus, ringing in my ears…</p><p>"Hear what?" Naruto asked, puzzled. He looked around, as if he could see what I thought I could hear.</p><p>"Never mind then," I murmured. "Let's catch this ferret, yeah?"</p><p>It was probably over kill. Two shadow users and Naruto, who could be a near infinite number of himself at any given moment, verses one lost pet ferret. There was just no way we <em> weren't</em> going to catch it.</p><p>Once it got past the shock of being manhandled, it was actually pretty friendly and seemed content enough to curl up in Naruto's backpack, even though we'd brought a pet carrier with us.</p><p>Mizugiwa was a small town inside Land of Rivers, so it was still a fair distance from where we were. That said, there was nothing particularly critical about this mission and it was nice to do something that was <em> easy</em> .</p><p>The lack of Sasuke was like a shadow hanging over us – noticeable, but more important in that it was a reflection of bigger things – but Shikamaru didn't make for a bad team mate. I was biased, obviously, but the three of us worked well together, even in something as simple as this.</p><p>The humming didn't stop – faint enough that if I wasn't listening for it I didn't notice it – but it didn't get any louder either. I almost thought I was imagining it, like a song stuck in my head.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>"This is kinda strange," Shikamaru noted, as we approached Mizugiwa. "It's the middle of the day, but there's not a single person in sight."</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed, eyes darting over the scenery. It was hilly and steep, but the land was terraced with rice paddies and it was lush and green. There were plenty of well cared for paddocks and crops. There should have been someone out and about.</p><p>"We should start running recon tactics," Shikamaru said, mouth pulling downwards.</p><p>"You think it's serious?" Naruto asked, an uncharacteristic frown on his face. "Maybe they're just… having a village meeting or something." He scratched the back of his neck. "Everything looks really peaceful."</p><p>"It can't hurt to be careful," Shikamaru replied. "Sense anything, 'Kako?"</p><p>I shook my head. "The town's too far away."</p><p>"We'll split up, circle around," Shikamaru decided. "If it's nothing, then it's nothing. Otherwise, we should be prepared."</p><p>I nodded. "Naruto, can you give us each a clone for communication?" We should give them a snappy name if we kept using them like this. Comm-clones?</p><p>"Sure," he agreed. "As spiders?"</p><p>"Umm," I said. Then I saw the mischievous look in his eyes and elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p>"Ow, ow. Okay, not spiders then."</p><p>"As yourself is fine," I said. "Otherwise it'll just be one-way communications. Spiders can't talk."</p><p>"I bet they kind of could," Naruto teased. "It's not like they're real spiders or anything."</p><p>"Leaving aside arguments of chakra metaphysics for the moment," Shikamaru said drolly. "Can we get moving?"</p><p>Naruto popped off two clones and we took to the trees, separating with the barest rustle of leaves to mark our passing. I kept my eyes peeled for danger, but saw nothing. Even the sound that had been nipping at my ears for days had vanished.</p><p>The silence was a little unnerving. I'd started to get used to it.</p><p>Then we saw the village.</p><p>"Oh man," the Naruto beside me said softly. He looked sad, and stricken. "Who the hell would do something like that?"</p><p>I pressed my lips together in a thin line and didn't answer. The place was totalled. There were blacked charcoal frames of burnt down houses, piles of rubble, deep craters dug into the ground with the corresponding dirt thrown everywhere. Nothing had been spared, and nothing was untouched.</p><p>Fire, I could pass off. But some of the damage was clearly ninjutsu.</p><p>Land of Rivers had its own shinobi village – the Village Hidden in the Valleys – but it hardly made sense for them to destroy a town in their own country. Apart from that, River Country was bordered by Wind and Fire which wasn't pleasant to consider either.</p><p>"Let's see if anyone is down there," I said.</p><p>Walking into that destroyed town was eerie. It was worse than cleaning up after the Exam Invasion, because that had been <em> over</em> and the damage hadn't been that great. This place was destroyed, and worse, it was <em> empty.</em></p><p>"No bodies," I noted, not sure whether that was a relief or not. It wasn't that I wanted there to be bodies, but then it raised the question of 'where are they, then?' There were certainly no survivors wandering around.</p><p>Gingerly, I tapped a finger on the blacked wood of a house frame, eyeing the white ash smouldering on the ground. It was still warm.</p><p>Naruto shook his head. "The others haven't seen any either."</p><p>"Any sign that the attackers are still here?" I asked, carefully scanning the streets.</p><p>"No. Shikamaru says to meet up at the town square."</p><p>I nodded. There was nothing that could be done immediately, and whatever course of action was coming next was something that we'd have to discuss.</p><p>I picked my way through the remains of the town, carefully heading towards the meeting point. There was still nothing alive, no sign of the people that lived here. The destruction had been thorough. There was furniture and belongings littering the streets, whole houses pulled apart before they had been destroyed.</p><p>Shikamaru and Naruto were both waiting when I got there, and the clone behind me dismissed itself with a puff. The ringing in my ears was back, and it set me on edge. I couldn't tell if it was harmless, anymore, or if it was connected.</p><p>"What happened here?" Naruto asked, agitated, as soon as I got within conversational distance. His hands were clenched into fists, like he wanted to know who did this so he could punch them. "This is horrible!"</p><p>"I don't know," I said, glancing at Shikamaru. He shook his head. "But it probably wasn't done that long ago. Today, or yesterday, maybe."</p><p>"Then we find them," Naruto declared. "This isn't <em> right.</em> "</p><p>"We do kind of have our own mission to finish," Shikamaru said mildly, stuffing his hands into his pockets and slouching. It was probably the most token of protests imaginable.</p><p>"We can't worry about delivering a ferret when there are people that need our help!" Naruto protested immediately. "Besides, this is where we're supposed to take it and there's no one here."</p><p>And that was kind of a large loophole, if we had to explain things, wasn't it? I ignored the little voice that said 'Hokage-sama is not going to be impressed'.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, don't get so worked up, I agree," Shikamaru drawled. "The question is, what are we going to do now?"</p><p>We didn't know who, didn't know when, didn't know why… we didn't know <em> anything.</em> Changing that would have to be our first step. There was a good chance that what was going on here was more than we could handle and we'd have to get backup.</p><p>"If they hit this village they might have hit others," I said. "Or some of the farm houses around the town. If they weren't hit, they might have noticed something."</p><p>"We should be able to track which way they went," Shikamaru contributed. "You can't move stealthily with that many hostages."</p><p>Or far, so there would have to be some kind of base nearby – and I didn't want to think about why they would have taken so many people away.</p><p>"Right!" Naruto nodded, determination shining in his eyes. "I'll send clones to the other towns, and we can follow the tracks and get those people back."</p><p>I glanced at Shikamaru. He gave a shrug.</p><p>"Sounds like a plan."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Stones of Gelel Arc: Chapter 67</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 67</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> We are each but a quarter note in a grand symphony ~ Guy Laliberte </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Crap!"</p><p>Already tense, Naruto's sudden exclamation had me freeze in place, kunai blossoming in either fist. When no immediate threat appeared, I let out a shaky breath and wondered, not for the first time, just what the hell we were doing. Two newly minted Chunin and a Genin, and not a clue what we were up against.</p><p>The more I considered it, the more uneasy I grew. A full town destroyed, all the people taken away. You'd have to be confident to do that in the middle of a country full of ninja, and what would you need with that many prisoners? <em> Test subjects…</em> something in my mind whispered and I really, really hoped Orochimaru was not involved here. Our last run in with Sound ninja had not gone so very well for us.</p><p>If it was, we weren't doing anything. We were gathering information and getting the hell out of here, to let someone else deal with it. Probably, we should skip the first step and move straight to the second even if it wasn't Hidden Sound, but it was a day travel back to the Land of Fire and by the time help got here, there might be nothing left to help.</p><p>"One of my clones was just ambushed," Naruto continued, sheepishly, steadying his own footing. "Four guys in some weird armour."</p><p>It would be pretty damn coincidental if this <em> wasn't</em> our mystery attackers.</p><p>"Which way?" Shikamaru asked calmly.</p><p>Naruto gestured to the side. "Over by the canyon thing. Not far, I guess."</p><p>The trail we were following wasn't going to go anywhere, and we had no idea what was at the end of it. A lone squad might be more manageable. <em> Might.</em> If they had attacked Naruto, they obviously knew we were here now, which meant security would get tighter, which would make infiltration harder-</p><p>I was already thinking in terms of 'how to do this' not 'is this a good idea', wasn't I?</p><p>"Let's circle around," Shikamaru said, coming to the same conclusion. "We don't want them at our backs when we find wherever they've taken those people."</p><p>And an initial engagement with them might yield as much useful information as finding the base would. It would, at least, give us an idea of <em> who.</em></p><p>"What kind of 'weird armour'?" I asked, hoping that Naruto had a little bit more information.</p><p>He shrugged, taking off again. "I don't know. It was kinda like samurai armour, I guess. It was just weird."</p><p>It wasn't very informative, but interesting in its own way. Ninja, generally, didn't tend to wear armour. Padded clothes, yes, even light ceramic plate, but nothing heavy. It didn't make much sense, in terms of cost-benefit. A well trained Chunin could dent metal with a punch, for starters, and even a Genin could be precise enough to aim for the joints. That wasn't even counting what jutsu would do to it. Additionally, it was heavy, inflexible and slowed you down and a ninja's best defense was <em> always</em> 'don't get hit'.</p><p>It was a pity Naruto didn't have more information, but a little bit was better than nothing.</p><p>The instant they came into view, Naruto launched himself forward, leaping down to the ground to confront them.</p><p>"Hey!" he roared. "Just who do you think you are?"</p><p>Shikamaru and I followed, landing lightly behind him in an arrow head formation, and took stock of the situation. As Naruto had said, there were four of them. Three were identical, wearing the same dull brown armour and pointed helms, carrying the same spiked mace as a weapon. Their chakra was odd, slightly off and unbalanced, but different enough to tell they were individuals and not clones. The fourth was more interesting, wearing shined silver plate over greens and blues, and a cape backed with red. His helm covered most of his face, but there was faint surprise as he turned to see Naruto.</p><p>"Didn't we," he asked slowly, voice a steady monotone, "already kill you?"</p><p>An interesting question, given that shadow clones didn't leave bodies. Sloppy, to not have expected a feint or trap.</p><p>But to me, more interesting was what I <em> heard.</em> Just on the edge of hearing, that faint sound I had been hearing for so long was becoming louder. No. Not louder. Clearer. As if, should I just listen closely, there would be a tune, a melody, a song…</p><p>It was slightly worrying. More than slightly, I amended to myself. It wasn't genjutsu, and I doubted I was hallucinating something so specific, harmless and <em> constant</em> , and yet the others couldn't hear it.</p><p>Usually, if I was feeling something that others could not, it was chakra. But that was more a feeling, a knowing, than something that could be conflated with sight or sound or touch. I might have described chakra in those terms, metaphorically, but it wasn't like I ever mistook it for one or the other.</p><p>So I… didn't know what it was.</p><p>I didn't know what it meant, either. If it had just been <em> now</em> I would have associated it with these people. But it had started days ago, and I could sense them, so I would have known if they were following us for so long.</p><p>It was a bit of a conundrum.</p><p>Naruto launched himself forward at the leader, a sudden burst of energy with two clones fading into existence on either side. It was a straight forward opening move, forceful, but I was still surprised when, at the last minute, the leader pivoted, neatly avoiding the attack and lashing out with pinpoint accuracy.</p><p>It reminded me of Lee. Efficient, clean, minimal wasted energy. And fast, too.</p><p>Then I couldn't observe anymore, because the other three had turned to join the fight, and we could hardly let them gang up on Naruto.</p><p>It wasn't my best fight. I could admit that. I was … distracted. By the sound I could hear, trying to listen and find it, hear it changing and straining to understand what it actually was. That kind of split attention could be lethal in a fight, it could make your reactions a second too slow, keep you off balance, cloud the best course of action until you made mistake after mistake.</p><p>It was luck that it didn't come to that. Well. Luck and Shikamaru. Naruto might have been caught up in his own fight, but Shikamaru covered me, working around my mistakes, directing us all until all four of them stood bound in our Shadow Possession Jutsu.</p><p>"What-" the leader rasped. "What have you done to me?"</p><p>I could feel him straining against the Shadow Possession, pushing and twisting, but it was nowhere <em> near</em> the level required to counter it. After so many opponents that had been able to, I was almost surprised.</p><p>"Tie them up," Shikamaru commanded Naruto tersely. Naruto scrambled to comply, dragging out ninja wire while the two of us manipulated them into position.</p><p>"Who are you?" I asked, crouching in front of the leader, once Naruto had secured them all. He wasn't wearing any insignia, not anywhere I could see. That didn't prelude him being a missing nin but it still didn't add up quite right.</p><p>I reached out to carefully remove his helm, hoping that being able to see his face would make questioning easier. And –</p><p><em> red</em></p><p>-I breathed out slowly, carefully, matching the same pattern as before, trying to ignore the involuntary hitch that had happened. I put the helmet on the ground, hands resolutely not shaking. It had only been a second, maybe two, just a brief moment of blankness.</p><p>His eyes were red.</p><p>For a second, I had seen Sharingan. They weren't, though. They were a different shade of red, a second ring circling the pupil, similar to Kurenai-sensei. The knowledge didn't stop the sharp spike of fear, the racing heartbeat or the dryness of my throat. It had been completely and utterly unexpected, caught me off guard and thrown me for a loop.</p><p>"My name is Temujin," he said stiffly.</p><p>Shikamaru was watching us – no, he was watching me, eyes eagle-sharp. He'd seen it. He'd seen it during the fight and he'd seen it now and I needed to keep it together. We had a prisoner to question. I needed to keep it together.</p><p>My ears were ringing.</p><p>No, they weren't. I was still hearing the song.</p><p>Shit. I needed to keep it together.</p><p>"Temujin," I repeated, aware my pause had lasted too long. My voice scraped out, husky, but it didn't falter or wobble. Good enough. "What were you doing here?" It was a less than inspired choice, but I was scrambling. None of us were exactly trained in interrogation, beyond basic Academy theoreticals. If he didn't want to talk, I didn't think we were going to be able to <em> make</em> him.</p><p>He ignored the question. "That power you used… what was it?"</p><p>Sometimes, even the questions that people asked were enough to tell you things. This questions had to be one of those. While civilians didn't tend to understand chakra, this man was no simple civilian. So. Who was he, then?</p><p>Also, the fact that he felt confident enough to ask questions, to demand answers, even though he was tied up, said something too. He felt confident. Whether it was in his ability to escape, or the certainty he would be rescued, he still felt as if he retained the upper hand.</p><p>Naruto made a soft 'huh?' sound behind me, confused at the question.</p><p>"Where are you from?" Shikamaru asked, appearing by my side and taking over the questioning. He tucked a hand under my elbow and chivied me gently out of the way. For all that his movements were full of the same easy grace as usual, his grip was tense.</p><p>I stood, and didn't stumble – I had too much control over my body for that – and took a few steps away. I felt lightheaded, like the world was just a little bit distant. It was fine. It was fine.</p><p>Naruto was watching me with a furrowed brow, he knew something was up, even if not what. Naruto might have been oblivious, and a little dense, but he wasn't stupid. Especially when it came to his friends.</p><p>Next to him was the pile of weaponry and gear that he'd taken from them when restraining them. It wasn't much - Temujin's gloves and sword, some thick bracer from his arm, the spiked maces – but it was more interesting than just standing around aimlessly, and I didn't really want to let my mind wander. Not right now.</p><p><em> Just breathe. It'll be okay. Nothing is happening. </em></p><p>The gloves were plated, well made and jointed so that they didn't restrict movement. The thick bracer had a retracting shield in it, which was incredibly interesting. I made a note of the design, before I set it aside. The sword, though. That was the most intriguing piece. Because it was <em> familiar.</em></p><p>Swords, here, were very, very rarely double sided. The classic katana shape, with a single cutting edge or sometimes only a sharp point for stabbing movements, and variations thereof. Even Kubikiri Bocho, for all its size and brutality, had only a single edge.</p><p>This was a broadsword. Or close enough – I was hardly an expert at European medieval weaponry. Which… where did they come from?</p><p>It was well made, but the handle was ornate, with a large red gem fixed in the center of the hilt. I wasn't an expert on gemstones, either, but it was odd. Not a ruby. Not a garnet. It had a very consistent colour, no lines or waves or distortions. It almost seemed… artificial.</p><p>I tapped it gently with a fingernail, not sure what I was expecting to find. But the second my finger came into contact with it, I knew that there was something. I flicked it, with a tiny whisp of chakra and a single pure, clear note rang out, joining the song – no, the <em> symphony</em> – that was on the edge of my hearing.</p><p>I glanced around. Neither Shikamaru nor Naruto had noticed, but the captives were all looking in my direction. Right.</p><p><em> It is to do with them. This stone… they can hear it too. It's to do with chakra, too, but they don't know that. Or they don't call it chakra. </em></p><p>"Problem?" Shikamaru said, glancing in my direction. He might not have heard, but he could tell that something had happened.</p><p>"That may," I said, a tad sheepishly, "have just sent out a signal as to where we are."</p><p>"Almost certainly," Temujin agreed, blandly, the first thing he'd said since asking what chakra was. Shikamaru and Naruto's combined efforts hadn't really yielded anything other than frustration. I had tuned it out, I realized with dull surprise, hadn't even been listening to them.</p><p>"Troublesome," Shikamaru sighed, looking like he wanted to roll his eyes.</p><p>"Don't sound so smug, jerk," Naruto said, scowling at Temujin. "I don't care who's coming to rescue you. We'll beat them too. What you did to that town just isn't right."</p><p>"It was necessary," Temujin said, eyes cutting towards him.</p><p>"The hell it was!" Naruto shouted back, pointing aggressively at him. "How can you even say such a thing?"</p><p>His jostling apparently awoke the ferret in his backpack – funny, since it had stayed calm during a <em> fight</em> – who poked its head out the top and then slithered out with a lithe motion. I saw it and dismissed it. Right now, I couldn't have cared less for our original mission.</p><p>"Hey, don't-!" Naruto squawked as it ran down his leg, grasping at it and missing. The ferret darted away from him and, instead of disappearing into the forest, slithered around Temujin and popped up on his shoulder.</p><p>Temujin hardly looked impressed.</p><p>"Leave it," Shikamaru said tiredly. "We need to finish up here and move." He ran a hand through his hair, obviously calculating the best course of action. We didn't want to stay, if reinforcements were coming. We'd won this fight, quite handily, but we had had the advantage of surprise, and risking a repeat wasn't a good idea. We'd gotten some information from Temujin, but the big questions 'where are you from', 'what are you doing' and 'what happened to those people' remained unanswered.</p><p>I met Shikamaru's eyes, wondering just how much he meant by 'finish up'. We weren't equipped to take care of prisoners, especially ones with abilities we didn't understand. It rankled to let them go, but the other option was very final. I could probably do it – a ruthless part of myself I didn't particularly appreciate – but I doubted Shikamaru could and Naruto certainly would never allow it to occur. In some ways, this very much mirrored the situation with the Sand Siblings at the end of the Exam Invasion, but this time we didn't have the upper hand.</p><p>I nodded, setting the sword back down with the rest of the things. My fault, for being too careless. Tempting as it was to take it and deprive Temujin of his weapon, if it was trackable then that was an insanely stupid idea.</p><p>"I could summon a toad," Naruto offered. "Take them with us."</p><p>Shikamaru considered it, then discarded the idea. "If they can be tracked, then there's no point." He glanced at me, question in his eyes.</p><p>I shrugged. "Possibly," I agreed. The stone was key. But it wasn't the source, was it?</p><p>I strode over to the other captives, ignoring Temujin. Conversation wasn't getting us anywhere, and now our time was running out. Physical inspection would have to do. I didn't really expect to learn very much from it, but then I tried to remove the helmet from the first man and couldn't.</p><p>"Interesting," I noted, as my hands failed to find a catch to release it. I examined him, much more closely. "I think they're some kind of … golem. Not clones but more like puppets."</p><p>Interesting and worrying, that.</p><p>They weren't automations, clearly. They had been capable of responding, adapting, and reacting during the fight. They had some governing intelligence. They had chakra, however strange it was.</p><p>They had red eyes, same shade as Temujin, same shade as that blasted <em> stone</em> . It might have meant something. It might not. Having almost expected it, I didn't flinch this time.</p><p>I didn't know of anywhere that had jutsu like that. Clone jutsu were a dime a dozen, and Hidden Sand was the acknowledged master of puppetry, but this was something else altogether.</p><p>"Do you feel that?" Naruto asked, frowning at the ground. He was flexing his toes in his sandals, minutely shifting his weight.</p><p>I didn't at first, then abruptly, I could. Vibrations.</p><p>"Earthquake?" Naruto asked, uncertainly.</p><p>It wasn't impossible. But Land of Rivers wasn't exactly earthquake territory.</p><p>"Let's go," Shikamaru said.</p><p>We jumped into the trees, leaving the four captives behind. But we didn't go far before Shikamaru signaled and we doubled back, hiding ourselves in the leaves and waiting.</p><p>The vibrations grew worse, stronger and stronger, until we could hear the crashing of trees as something felled them.</p><p>"What is that?" Naruto gaped, as something pushed up the valley towards where we were.</p><p>I had to admit that I had no idea. It looked like a giant bulldozer, done up steampunk style. It was huge, towering above the trees, moving at a fair pace and creating huge amounts of destruction.</p><p>It didn't come close, so we didn't see that much of it, but we stayed in place and waited. Eventually, a woman in similar armour to Temujin appeared through the trees, followed by a cadre of the golem-men.</p><p>She seemed to find the sight of Temujin bound amusing, stopping to speak to him before letting him free. His reply was short and clipped, not friendly but not antagonistic either.</p><p>We waited until they were gone, then slid backwards, taking ourselves in the other direction for a bit more security.</p><p>"We need to send a clone to the border," I said quietly. "We need to let them know."</p><p>Neither of them argued.</p><p>"Will a clone make it that far?" Shikamaru asked.</p><p>I blinked. I hadn't even considered. I didn't think they had limited distance.</p><p>Naruto considered it, then shrugged. "I don't know. I've never tried. But I'll send a toad too." That way, the message would still get through.</p><p>"I'm surprised they haven't noticed already," Shikamaru said. "It's not exactly subtle."</p><p>"They probably have," I agreed. "But unless it starts heading towards Fire Country…" Hidden Valley was nominally allied with both Konoha and Hidden Sand, being that it lay between the two. That had both advantages and disadvantages, when it came to sourcing help. In this case, it probably meant that Konoha wouldn't interfere until they received a written invitation, or unless the culprit was Hidden Sand.</p><p>Or – hopefully – if a known mission in the area became entangled. Konoha looked after its people.</p><p>"What a drag," Shikamaru sighed. He rubbed a hand across his face. "We should probably follow that thing." He sounded decidedly unenthusiastic about that idea.</p><p>"They'll be expecting us," I said, though I didn't know how much that would actually effect. It appeared to be a mobile fortress, which meant they expected to be able to fight off attackers. On the other hand, they hadn't known about chakra, which gave us the upper hand in more than just combat.</p><p>"Follow it carefully, then," Shikamaru amended.</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The first shinobi on the scene have a responsibility for reconnaissance, and to provide up to date information and intelligence for reinforcements. </em></p><p>That was the general gist of one of the many ninja rules. It was generally applicable to things like discovering enemy camps, sneak attacks and emergency situations, where you didn't have a lot of Intel to begin with. That was pretty much the situation we had here, so our course of action was pretty clear.</p><p>We'd already given it a good shot, with Naruto's Shadow Clones searching every which way. That left the three of us tucked away on a cliff face, observing the stronghold as it travelled.</p><p>By nightfall, it had stopped, unable or unwilling to continue in the dark. I imagined it would prove difficult to rescue if they accidently drove it into a river, or toppled it down a canyon.</p><p>It proved a good opportunity to observe, as the golem-men went to and fro, setting up perimeters and clearing away debris from the outside of the stronghold. Yet more returned to the base from other directions, and I was almost resigned to the idea that there was probably more destruction in those places.</p><p>"There's like a whole army of them!" Naruto hissed.</p><p>A small army, maybe. I wasn't exactly certain on what terms to use for a certain sized unit of soldiers. Ninja had squads, or divisions, and very little in between. A platoon? A company? Regardless of what name you called it, there were a lot of them. More than the three of us could handle if it came to it.</p><p>"They won't do anything important outside," I said quietly, as we observed. If we truly wanted to learn anything we'd have to go in.</p><p>Which would be tricky. Intelligence gathering was an art, which was why there was a whole division responsible for it. Basic observation like this accounted for a fair amount, but to get more we'd have to infiltrate.</p><p>There were a lot of ways we could go about it. With transformation jutsu, passing a visual inspection was trivial, and we could simply walk in. However, that didn't supply us with codes or security protocols, and a simple conversation would be enough to blow our cover.</p><p>There was the extremely risky path of getting inside simply by being taken side – allowing yourself to be captured and manipulating the situation into a positive outcome. That wasn't exactly an amateurs game, though.</p><p>But we could likely get inside without being seen. We'd been following them for hours, watching them from a distance, and they hadn't shown any signs of noticing us. We'd just… sneak.</p><p>"Has Team Ten done any infiltration work?" I asked.</p><p>Shikamaru looked at me sideways and shook his head. That was a pity. Ino-Shika-Cho teams were optimized for information gathering, though that didn't always mean infiltration. It would have been nice to have someone with experience in the situation.</p><p>The cat fortress hardly counted.</p><p>"What are we going to do?" Naruto asked eagerly. He was itching to <em> do</em> something, but he'd been surprisingly patient about it so far. I wondered if the fact that he was currently using clones had something to do with it – some sense that he was taking action, not just waiting for something to happen.</p><p>Shikamaru steepled his fingers and stared at the stronghold. It wasn't quite his 'thinking pose' but the intention was clear. "'Kako," he said hesitantly. "Are you going to be able to do this?"</p><p>I blinked. "Yes," I said, automatically.</p><p>He looked at me. Okay, so I hadn't put the best foot forward this mission. I'd made a mistake. A few mistakes. But I wasn't-</p><p>"Yes," I repeated, more firmly.</p><p>"Alright. 'Kako and I will go inside and investigate. One through the main doors, and one in through the upper balconies." That would involve scaling the outside – without being seen – and then hoping that some of those windows up there actually opened. Tricky. "Naruto, you need to be our lookout. If something happens, and we need to get out fast or whatever."</p><p>Naruto might have looked a little disappointed at the order, but he didn't argue it.</p><p>"And if things start exploding, that's probably your cue to come and rescue us," I added, only slightly joking.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Stones of Gelel Arc: Chapter 68</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: So Elelith has begun writing fan-fanfiction for DOS. It's titled Sunshine and Stormclouds, and has three chapters so far.</p><p>The Gelel movie is one I really quite like, and not just because it has Gaara being awesome in it. I just wish that it had a bit more depth. It introduces so many interesting things, but never really explains them.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 68</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. ~ Buddha</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>We crouched out of sight and waited.</p><p>I could feel Naruto's chakra as bright as a lighthouse behind us, and I knew he would take being a lookout seriously. It was reassuring, even if subtlety didn't really feature amongst his skills. That was pretty much the reason that Shikamaru and I were going inside and he wasn't – we hardly wanted this to go the same way as the invasion of Kazahana Castle.</p><p>There was a gap in the patrol and Shikamaru caught my eye. This was it.</p><p>I nodded and we darted off, chakra boosting our speed while still maintaining silence. Shikamaru had the comparatively harder route; he had to get through the outside patrols, through the guarded doors and into the busy lower levels. I just had to get through the outside patrols, get up the walls without being seen, and find a way to break inside.</p><p>Comparatively.</p><p>The darkness helped cover our movements, and I made it to the walls without too many close calls. The lower parts of the machine were more exposed, caterpillar tracks like on a tank, gears for their movement, but above that everything was enclosed. It wasn't smooth all the way around, but ridged with columns and sections and pipes. I could see a few places that looked like promising entrances. Chakra made handholds completely redundant, but simply running straight up would be a lot easier to see. Instead, I darted up the wall in a kind of skittery crawl, staying as flat as possible.</p><p>I still felt incredibly vulnerable, out in the open, but every second that passed that didn't end in alarm bells ringing made me breathe a little easier.</p><p>About three quarters of the way up, there was a protruding platform, that bulged out and then dipped backwards. I would have almost said 'like a landing pad' except I really hoped they didn't have anything that could fly. Fortress tanks were bad enough, thank you.</p><p>At the top I paused, peeking over the edge of a flat portion. It seemed like a balcony, flat and clear, with large paneled doors leading into the stronghold itself. They were closed at the moment, but thrown open, they would open the entire space up.</p><p>There was no one inside that I could see, no chakra that I could sense, and so I pulled myself up onto it and padded forward.</p><p>A locked door was not really a challenge to a ninja, even when said ninja was being stealthy. Not unless it was a very good lock and a very good door. Given that this seemed to be a mobile fortress, it should have given me more trouble than it did, but they clearly hadn't been expecting an attack from this direction.</p><p>Poor planning on their part.</p><p>I tucked my lock picks back into my pouch, held the door open just enough that I could slide through the gap and then wedged it almost-closed. Leaving it open would be a clue that someone was here, but if I needed to get out in a hurry, then I probably wouldn't have time to pick the lock again.</p><p>The main room was huge and empty – probably some kind of meeting room. There was none of the wear and tear that suggested a gym or dojo, and it was too ornate; the floors some kind of marbled stone rather than anything practical. As I crossed the empty space, I saw a low dais against the wall, with a single chair centered to overlook it all.</p><p><em> Ah. Throne room. Really?</em></p><p>There wasn't much to see in there, however, and I slunk soundlessly over to the door and into the corridor beyond. Out of the throne room, things were more austere. The walls were simple metal, clean sharp lines that were functional rather than attractive. It seemed strange, almost alien, after so long with wood and stone. There was no one around, but even my breathing and heartbeat sounded loud in the silence, amped up by adrenaline. The ringing in my ears didn't really help my nerves, a constant reminder that there were things going on here that I didn't understand.</p><p>The corridor beyond the main room was well lit but empty. It was an eerie feeling as I ghosted along, on high alert for any one coming.</p><p>There were stairs close by, fairly wide and I expected they would be the main throughway for people heading to that main room. I ignored them for now, hoping that this high level would have more for interest. Shikamaru could explore below.</p><p>There were a few cupboards, a smaller meeting room and what looked like an observatory. Then I came across a furnished living room, with a connected bedroom. I spent several minutes investigating it, not certain what exactly I was looking for, but hoping I would find it. There wasn't anything that particularly stood out.</p><p>It was well furnished, with rich and expensive materials. The wardrobe was full of heavy, ornate robes. This was likely the room of the Daimyo or equivalent – rich, important, but not necessarily in a combat role. There was no weaponry or amour here and while it could have all been kept in an armory, there was none of the incidental detritus of weapon upkeep either – oil, cloth, whetstones.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was nothing that jumped out at me as interesting. There were no papers, or documents, or anything that really helped us. I slipped out of the room and kept looking.</p><p>Further along, there was a study.</p><p><em> Now this is more like it,</em> I thought.</p><p>There was no guarantee that it would have anything worthwhile inside, but it was worth the time it took to investigate.</p><p>It looked a typical office – huge desk, a low table piled with scattered papers, bookshelves full of serious tomes, decorative artwork on the walls – and it took a second look before things started to stand out as not quite right.</p><p>The papers piled on the table were dirty and crumpled.</p><p>The 'artwork' was a huge browned paper with hand drawn and faded ink, spread out under a glass cover, with dozens of coloured dots pressed onto the glass.</p><p>I frowned at it, the marks looking familiar. It was old and faded, and I wracked my brains for anything I might have seen in a history book and came up empty handed.</p><p>Carefully, I flicked through the scattered pages, touching them only the barest amount.</p><p><em> Dirty, crumpled – taken from the villages? Why?</em></p><p>There was a strange collection of things. Newspapers. Pamphlets. Maps.</p><p><em> Maps.</em></p><p>I spread it open and glanced up at the image on the wall. Yes. Yes, it was. It was a map, an old, old map. The coastline was different – either wrong, or changed – and the countries weren't delineated in the way I was familiar with, which probably accounted for why I hadn't recognized it.</p><p>The dots then… yes. That was River Country. That was where we were.</p><p><em> They've marked Wind Country too,</em> I though, mind racing. Did the different colours mean anything? If so, what? Had they attacked? Were they going to attack?</p><p>And why, exactly, were they trying to navigate from a map that old? Where had they even found that?</p><p>Where were they <em> from</em> ?</p><p>And what were they looking for?</p><p>That was definitely a search pattern. These weren't random attacks. But I didn't know of anything of interest in the area. They were sticking low, to the coastline almost – so not looking for the Hidden Villages, which were further inland – and there simply wasn't much here.</p><p>I moved away, around the desk, hoping to pick up more information. There was a single heavy book set on the surface, leather bound and <em> old</em> , the kind of book that should be in a glass case and handled with protective gloves. Gingerly, I lifted open the cover, hoping that it was somehow relevant and not just a sign that this guy was obsessed with old books.</p><p><em> The Book Of Gelel</em> it said, in heavy, elegant writing.</p><p>I turned the pages carefully, skimming more than reading. Half my attention was still on the door, making sure that I'd be aware if someone started coming this way. For a moment, I thought it was going to be useless – a royal family tree, some kind of trade route or agreement - and then I turned the page and staring up at me was a copy of the same map that graced the wall. It wasn't just the one either, there were others, close ups of certain provinces and towns, a whole landscape that barely resembled the one I knew.</p><p><em> The Empire of Gelel.</em></p><p>I stared at it. Was this an artefact from before the formation of the Elemental Nations? Or a copy of, at least. That was an incredible thought. Everyone knew there had been a continent spanning empire, in the days before the Sage of Six Paths had wrangled a wild world into some semblance of civilisation. There were plenty of ruins and abandoned cities across the Elemental Nations to prove it, though the details beyond that were very slim. I had looked into it, the possibility that this world was merely <em> future</em> of the one I had left, but there were too many fundamental differences for it to be true. To be honest, there was relief in that. If I had died and crossed between worlds, then everything I had left had continued on without me – was continuing <em> now</em> .</p><p>If I had been reincarnated in the far future, then everything I had ever known was dust beneath my feet.</p><p>Practically, there was no difference. I would never return, never see them again, never have anything to do with that life. It was gone, either way. But personally…. It mattered.</p><p>If it was true, if this was actual, written evidence of an empire lost to history, that made this book literally priceless.</p><p><em> But does that explain anything?</em> Unless it had clues to some kind of ancient treasure…</p><p>It seemed a bit far-fetched.</p><p><em> Then again, my </em> life<em> is far-fetched.</em> Improbable didn't equal impossible. Still, I didn't know enough to say for sure.</p><p>I flicked onwards, hoping something would jump out at me. 'Here lies the artefact of sacred power' maybe? Something did, but it wasn't what I expected. Math; pages and pages of complicated math. It almost looked like chakra conversion equations, proto-fuinjutsu. It was well beyond my level and I paged through it, wonderingly. What was this?</p><p>The sense of approaching people drew my attention. They were only at the stairs, which meant they could go either way, but it was a reminder that I wasn't alone here. I'd been lucky to find the level deserted; late at night wasn't exactly a time for meetings with the boss.</p><p>I bit my lip and considered the book still laid out on the desk. I <em> thought</em> it was related to whatever was going on here, but I didn't know, and I didn't have time to read it properly to find out. The obvious answer, then, was to take it. If it was important, though, it would certainly be missed.</p><p>The chakra equations looked terribly important, besides, and there was a reasonably large part of me that was dying to have a spare week or two to try and decipher them. That was a terrible reason to consider taking it. That was <em> stealing.</em></p><p>And yes, I knew that it was terrible morals to be okay with taking things for the sake of the mission and find the exact same scenario horrible otherwise. That, however, was a state of mind that Konoha tried very hard to instil in us, with corresponding rewards and punishments for those who followed or broke the system. When you had an army of people who were unlikely to be <em> caught</em> stealing, you wanted them to reject the choice all on their own.</p><p>The oncoming chakra presences bypassed the bedrooms, turning towards the study and made my choice for me. I picked up the book, trying to be as gentle as possible, and stacked it carefully in my backpack.</p><p>I ducked out the door, slipping up the wall and sticking to the ceiling. People rarely looked up. Still, to be extra careful, I layered a False Surroundings genjutsu over myself and crept slowly along the corridor. The two people were getting closer, and would pass right underneath me.</p><p>My palms felt sweaty and I flexed them on the cool metal of the ceiling.</p><p>It was the maybe-lord whose room I had seen – the same heavy robes – and a woman in armour. Not the same one that had retrieved Temujin, which was probably important.</p><p>"What do you think of Temujin's tale?" the lord asked, striding along.</p><p>"Farfetched," she bit out in return. "Lying to cover his failure is more likely, Haido-sama."</p><p>Haido chuckled. "I don't think lying to me has ever crossed Temujin's mind. He is far too loyal."</p><p>The woman made a 'tch' sound. "It could cause trouble if it's true," she conceded. "And it might explain why we haven't heard from Ranke's fleet. But we haven't run into anyone else with those powers."</p><p><em> Fleet?</em> I didn't actually like the implication of numbers that a word like 'fleet' brought up. And that was, what, a nautical term? Boats?</p><p>"I suppose it was too much to hope that they remained primitive and uncivilized in our absence," Haido said, swinging the door to the study open. "Still, we have seen very little to foster the idea that they are a true threat to our plans." He paused, turning to look at the woman who had faltered a few steps back. "Is there a problem, Fugai?"</p><p>She turned slowly, tilting her head. From my position I could barely see the prominent flare of her nostrils.</p><p><em> Scent tracker, shit.</em> My pulse doubled, and I tried very hard to keep my breathing shallow and quiet. Blocking scent was a much, much harder tact than sight or sound or even chakra, and there was no jutsu I knew that would eliminate a scent trail that had already been laid.</p><p>She stared back up the corridor, nose twitching and eyes darting around. "No, Haido-sama," she said after a moment. "There's nothing."</p><p>They went inside and shut the door. I let myself breathe a tiny, tiny sigh of relief.</p><p>Then I remembered that I would only have a few seconds before they noticed what was missing, dropped to the floor and bolted. I was almost at the throne room when I heard the study door slam back open and the heavy clatter of footsteps. The alarm went off, drowning almost everything out, and I dove through the doors, across the balcony and down the side of the building, sticking to the metal with barely enough grip to control my descent.</p><p>Halfway down, I looked below to find a landing spot, only to see the milling of Golems all around.</p><p><em> Crap.</em></p><p>I increased the chakra to my hands, juddering to a halt.</p><p><em> Can't go down, can't go up, can't stay here…</em> It didn't actually look like I had a lot of options. That was not so good.</p><p><em> What about across, then?</em> River Country was heavily mountainous, the whole countryside flattened out into levels like an excellent topographic map. That meant that no matter where you were, there was likely to be a cliff nearby. In the dark, it was hard to tell, but the stronghold had driven down a passage between two higher points, then stopped where the narrow ravine had opened out into a flat.</p><p>I pushed to my feet and went sideways, running horizontal along the stronghold until I reached the back. The sheer area of it made me perfectly aware I had explored very little of the inside, but I couldn't regret that now. The cliffs were too far away to jump to but I had kunai and ninja wire and I was pretty sure I could make a throw.</p><p>The first kunai clattered against the stone, but failed to find purchase and I hurriedly reeled it back in before it dropped to the ground. They hadn't seen me yet, but I could hear the shouting and cursing down below as security was tightened.</p><p>The second attempt stuck and I gave it a fair tug to make sure. Then I jumped before I could have second thoughts.</p><p>My stomach bottomed out at the sensation of free fall, barely affected by the thin wire swinging me sideways instead of going straight down.</p><p>I hit the wall with a heavy thump, going too fast for comfort and much lower down than I was happy with. I took a few moments just to breathe and promise myself that I wouldn't do that again. Really, Tarzan made the whole 'swing to safety' thing look so easy and comfortable.</p><p>Then I scrambled upwards, breeched the top of the cliff and started to loop around to where we'd left Naruto.</p><p><em> I hope Shikamaru made it out okay.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Shikamaru was already waiting anxiously by Naruto when I got back.</p><p>"You made it!" Naruto whispered, not quite quietly enough. I hushed him, hoping the sound hadn't carried.</p><p>"Sorry about the alarm," Shikamaru muttered. "They saw me."</p><p>Hadn't <em> I</em> set it off? "I was on my way out, anyway." I shrugged; it didn't really matter, did it? "But we're going to need to be careful. One of them was a scent tracker. I'm pretty sure I lost her on the walls, but if she picks up our trail again..." And I had little doubt she would. A well trained bloodhound was almost impossible to shake, and a well trained Inuzuka even more so. I didn't know where on the scale she would fall, but better safe than sorry.</p><p>Shikamaru groaned and rubbed a hand across his face. "Even better. We need to move, then. There's no point sticking around, if it's just going to get us caught."</p><p>"But did you find anything?" Naruto asked eagerly as we took off.</p><p>"I know what they're doing with all the people," Shikamaru said flatly.</p><p>I cast a glance at him. "How bad is it?"</p><p>His lips were set in a grim line. "They're using them to power the stronghold."</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>"What?" Naruto croaked out.</p><p>"They're keeping them in some kind of stasis pods, all hooked up to this generator. I followed some of the piping; it goes right down to the main engine."</p><p>"Chakra batteries," I breathed. It sounded very much like The Matrix, dozens if not hundreds of humans all hooked up to provide power… It explained why they were taking the villagers, and how they could manage to power such a creation without copious supplies of fuel.</p><p>"There's more too," Shikamaru added. "About how they made the golems. The bodies are formed with some kind of clay, then just activated with the machine."</p><p>That kind of chakra siphoning and redistribution was … incredibly complex. I'd never heard of it being used on more than an individual scale, though that could partially be because ninja didn't like sharing techniques. Still, it wouldn't be simple to set up. It would need knowledge… the kind of knowledge that was in the book I just took.</p><p>"And," he continued. "They're looking for something called the 'Stones of Gelel'."</p><p>"Gelel?" I repeated. "That's- no wait. Stones of?" Because the way the book had read I'd almost assumed that 'gelel' was a word for chakra, or more generically, power. But if it wasn't, if it was talking about a specific item… "The stone in Temujin's sword. It reacted to my chakra. Like an amplifier." There was something here, and I chased the idea, but the conclusion stayed just out of reach. I blew out a breath. "Never mind. I saw the map they were using. All the points that they're searching. They aren't the only group, either. There's another one. One that they called a fleet."</p><p>"Where?" Shikamaru asked tersely.</p><p>"West, along the coastline, mostly. They're going right down into Land of Wind, though."</p><p>"Wind? We have to warn Gaara," Naruto said, alarmed. He didn't wait for an answer, merely changing direction.</p><p>"We'd never get to Hidden Sand," I disagreed, even as I followed him.</p><p>"No, but Wind Country will have border patrols too," Naruto countered. "Besides, if we know where these guys are attacking, then we can help. And we've already sent messages to <em> our</em> border."</p><p>We couldn't really keep an eye on the stronghold anymore, not without having to fight. And Naruto was right, we had sent messages. And Naruto had clones out that were hopefully warning the surrounding villages. There wasn't much we could do here and now.</p><p>"Shikamaru?" I asked, uncertainly.</p><p>He sighed. "Troublesome. Yeah, I think we should see what they're up to in Wind Country. It could be important."</p><p>Well, that was settled then.</p><p>We didn't make it the whole way that night. It was late, and dark and we needed sleep. We went far enough to hopefully get away from Fugai and, despite Naruto's protest, set up camp. He might have had boundless energy, but if we did end up fighting I didn't want to be wrecked by the time we got there.</p><p>Not that I ended up sleeping. I took first watch and eagerly cracked open my stolen book, reading by the faint light of chakra from my hand. It wasn't easy going. The print was old and faded, and the wording was archaic. A fair bit of what I learnt was guess work and assumption.</p><p>With a little bit more direction – <em> stones of Gelel</em> – it was a bit more productive. The stones were what they used for everything, it seemed, using them like batteries. Even if I was only skimming through, I could see multiple use of them – agriculture, engineering, medicine, all with their own chapters – but I was more interested in <em> where </em> right now. There was a huge section on the mining of them, how they were cut, how they were treated, how the mine was formed, but nothing on where the mine actually was.</p><p><em> No wonder they're searching</em> , I thought, flicking back a few pages. <em> These stones… </em> I wondered how on earth this empire had fallen. Even with this one book there was just so much potential.</p><p>Potential I didn't really want to see in the hands of anyone who thought that invading and randomly attacking innocent villages was a viable strategy.</p><p>I marked down the locations of attack on my map – all of them along the main trade route marked in the book. It made sense, if the stones had been a major export. But I wasn't so sure. If they'd gone to all the trouble of withholding the location of it from written record, I doubted that they had loaded the stones out the front door. But in the end, we weren't looking for the mine. We were looking to stop them from finding the mine.</p><p><hr /></p><p>So up until about a week ago, you would have ended up with a very different chapter. I really struggled with this one, got it <em> almost</em> ready to post, then realized it would never work. So it was right back to starting over. That was… very frustrating.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Stones of Gelel Arc: Chapter 69</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Yeah, I know this one took a while. I got stuck, and it expanded in weird places and I don't even know.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 69</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Let's follow the sun until the shadows fade</em></p><p><em> Cross the desert till we find our place</em></p><p><em> Think of where you're going not where you've come from</em></p><p><em> Just lift your eyes and follow the sun </em></p><p><em> ~ Evermore; Follow The Sun </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Wake up!"</p><p>I rolled to my feet, disorientated, but hands going for my kunai automatically. I felt gritty and tired- that brief nap had not nearly been long enough – but snapped to awareness sharply at the tone of Naruto's voice.</p><p>There was only a brief moment to assess the situation; incoming enemies, one of the Gelel warriors (<em> Fugai?</em> ) and at least two squads of golems, too close, I could hear the music that seemed to mean Gelel, before there was a rush of chakra and an ear splitting howl.</p><p>Compressed air blasted at us, slamming into our little camp. Naruto took the worst of it, standing defensively between us and them. He was thrown back, slamming violently into the ground. I was just caught in the edges of the attack, but even being clipped by it was bad enough. I was spun around, tripping with more vertigo than the physical reality should have induced.</p><p><em> Like Dosu's Melody Arm, </em> I thought. Not that it helped. This was… not good.</p><p>We'd handled Temujin and his three okay, but that had been with the element of surprise on our side and in broad daylight. Twice that number without visuals would be a different prospect. Being a Nara didn't give us any special abilities to see in the dark, and without light we couldn't even use our shadow jutsu.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut against the nausea – it was too dark to see, anyway – and focused on my chakra sense. The kunai I threw clattered against metal but I doubted the hit had done much damage. With the golems being what they were, minor damage alone wouldn't be enough anyway, we'd have to find some way to restrain them or destroy them.</p><p>The golems were spreading out, clearly intending to circle around and trap us. I didn't know if they could see in the dark, or if they sensed in some other way. They'd clearly been able to navigate well enough to find us.</p><p>"Where is it?" A voice snarled out of the darkness. Yes, that was Fugai. We'd done what we could to lay false trails and shake them off – keeping to the tree tops, running up a river or two – but clearly it hadn't been enough.</p><p>She might have been talking about the mine – their ultimate goal – but there was no reason to believe that we would know its location. And we hadn't seriously countered them in any way, not enough to send that kind of force after us. So that meant that she was asking after the book, and that it was even more important than I had thought. And I had the inkling that it was very important indeed.</p><p>"What are you <em> talking</em> about?" Naruto shouted back. He sounded woozy, and I could hear the short shuffling steps he was taking as he staggered.</p><p>There was no response, just another dizzying howl that sent us scrambling back, then a sense of <em> movement</em> as they closed the gap too us. I yelped as something slammed into me – staff? Mace? They had all carried maces last time – and rolled across the ground. Just because I could vaguely tell where they were, didn't mean I knew what they were doing or how to fight them. Then again, the others didn't have even that advantage. Shikamaru cursed, and I knew he was thinking about retreat, but there wasn't going to be anywhere to retreat <em> to.</em></p><p>"You thought you could run from me?" Fugai snarled. "Come on, children! Let me see your '<em> power'</em> ." She howled, this attack a more focused blast of air. I felt the ground heave, and a scatter of dirt and rocks across my side as particles were thrown into the air. A rock the size of a fist clipped my shoulder; another hit I hadn't been able to see coming.</p><p>This wasn't going to work.</p><p>"That's all this is about for you, isn't it?" Naruto snarled, sounding angry. "Power? You don't even care about all the people that you've hurt."</p><p>"Sacrifices for the cause," Fugai tossed back.</p><p>"Shadow Clone Jutsu!" Naruto cried, and the sound of scuffling intensified exponentially. There was too much noise to pick targets out by sound. I knocked into one of the clones and was nearly belted for it.</p><p>"'Kako! Throw up a flare!" Shikamaru ordered.</p><p>That would give us a few seconds of light, but it would utterly destroy any kind of night vision we currently had going. A few seconds might not have been enough.</p><p>My hand went for my pouch and tags automatically, then paused and redirected. I couldn't form a lasting flare, taking something unstable and forcing it to hold, but I didn't need to because someone else had already done it.</p><p>I pulled the thin cylinder from the inner pocket of my jacket and activated it.</p><p><em> Zshooom</em></p><p>The legendary Sword of the Thunder God. <em> Also useful as a torch</em> , I thought with a hint of amusement.</p><p>There was a split seconds pause, as everyone adjusted to the change in situation, the steady thrum of the lightsaber almost blinding after the sheer darkness of before. I swung it, and the shadows danced, slicing the blade easily into the heavy armour of the nearest golem.</p><p>"Good thinking," Shikamaru said, and the shadows at our feet roiled.</p><p>"That's more like it!" One of the Naruto's crowed gleefully, leaping forward. His fist impacted with a heavy thud, leaving a nice dent in its wake.</p><p>I wasn't exactly trained at kenjutsu, but I was familiar with kunai use and fighting in general, so I could improvise. If I focused the lightsaber to a cutting edge, rather than to shock, its ability to slice easily through the golems more than made up for my own inexperience with using it.</p><p>The fact that Shikamaru was basically setting them up for me to take out also probably had something to do with it.</p><p>Fugai, from what I could make out in between focusing on my own opponents, was being occupied by Naruto. Her fighting style was rough and crude – much like his actually – but she had the speed and reflexes to make it work. Every time she drew in breath for one of those terrible howls, Naruto was up in her face, making her twist around and swallow it back down.</p><p>"People are only strong when they have something precious to protect," he quoted at her. "You think that just finding some stones is going to make you better?"</p><p>She laughed derisively. "You know nothing. Those stones are the foundation for our utopia. With them, no one will be able to stop us."</p><p>"I'll stop you!" Naruto said. He didn't shout it, just said it with a sort of quiet determination that was much more compelling. Blue chakra started gathering in his hand and a clone stepped forward to help him mold the Rasengan.</p><p>I twisted, carving through the chest of a golem that was held in place by Shikamaru's shadows. The pieces fell apart, the light fading from its eyes and leaving it inert. Another one struggled, Shadow Stitching Jutsu piercing both hands and feet and pinning it in place, and I swung again, barely feeling the resistance against my blade.</p><p>Naruto slammed the Rasengan into Fugai, drilling through her chest plate with a wail of rending metal, and she was thrown backwards into the dirt.</p><p>I lifted the lightsaber higher, letting the light still and illuminate the clearing cleanly. Shikamaru was kneeling behind me, one knee in the dirt, but his hands were clasped firmly in a rat seal and I could hardly argue with his results. The place looked like a mass grave, with the massive, toppled bodies everywhere, rent apart in ways that weren't always clean. There were the ones I had hacked apart with the lightsaber, the ones Naruto and his clones and simply <em> pummeled</em> out of shape, and at least one that had been punctured repeatedly with Shadow Stitching Jutsu until the life faded from it.</p><p>There were two of them left, and I hoped with the death of their leader, that they would retreat.</p><p>Shadows rippled across Fugai's body, and for a second I thought it was just an illusion – the light from the Sword of the Thunder God wasn't completely even, it was still <em> compressed lightning</em> – but her hand twitched, curling in the dirt and tensing so hard a shudder rocked across her entire body. Then her skin rippled and bulged, muscles underneath shifting beyond what was human, her entire structure reshaping itself.</p><p>The song that I equated with Gelel surged, not louder exactly but more present, maybe changing in tempo, in pitch, <em> something</em> , so I couldn't help but notice.</p><p>When she stood, she looked like a wolf. Well, not completely. Half way. A half wolf. A werewolf. Damn it.</p><p>"Hey!" Naruto objected. "That's- You work for Orochimaru!" It wasn't much of a leap to equate her transformation with the curse seal, or with whatever potion that Mizuki had cooked up, but I wasn't sure it was actually an accurate assumption.</p><p>"The only one I serve is Haido-sama!" Fugai snarled back at him. "He's the one who will lead us into a new era! He is our lord, our master, and I will not let you foil his plans!"</p><p>"And I won't let you hurt any more people!" Naruto shouted back, launching himself at her.</p><p>She breathed in again and this time when she howled the whole world seemed to toss like the sea in a storm. It was vertigo, but there was no genjutsu to cancel and I staggered and fell, unable to stay upright. My ears were ringing in more ways than one, and the lightsaber dropped from my nerveless fingers, plunging us back into darkness. I retched, trying to frantically scrabble for it, trying to get the light we needed back. The night seemed so much darker now, after having been illuminated, heavy and oppressive.</p><p><em> Where is it? Where is it?</em></p><p>My fingers raked up dirt and only dirt. I was having trouble telling up from down, my mouth tasted of sour stomach acid, there were still enemies about, and<em> I couldn't find our light.</em></p><p>I gathered chakra to my hand, enough to give a blue ghostly light. It wasn't much, just enough to throw outlines into focus, and I scanned the ground. <em> There!</em></p><p>I reached out –</p><p>- and a heavy armored foot slammed down on my hand, targeting the light. Pain surged up my arm like fire and a high pitched whine escaped my mouth. I tugged futilely as my hand was ground down into the dirt, something cracking ominously, but it was stuck. The pain was disrupting my chakra, and without my hand I couldn't form seals anyway. Instead, I curled forwards, over it – just in time to miss the end of the staff that plunged into the ground where my head had been – my other hand bracing against the ground and kicked upwards, foot clanging into a metal chin. I kicked again, levering the golem up and back just enough to pull my hand free and rolled out of the way.</p><p>I panted, cradling my hand to my chest. Adrenaline roared furious in my veins, battling the spikey waves of pain. Naruto and Fugai's chakra were closely intertwined, and Shikamaru's was moving unpredictably to my left with the last of the golems, so there would be no immediate help from them. I needed to get the light back.</p><p>Truthfully, I was more worried about Shikamaru than I was about Naruto. Naruto might have been impulsive and hot headed, but there was no denying he was good in a fight. Even, or maybe <em> especially</em> , when things were stacked against him. Even with that disastrous fight with Kimimaro still fresh in my memory, I did trust that Naruto could handle what was thrown at him better than the two of us could.</p><p>I flexed my fingers, then forced them into handsigns. "Earth Release; Earth Style Wall," I called, even though I couldn't hear my own voice. The ground I targeted – right underneath my opponents feet – churned, suddenly malleable with chakra. I pulled it up, not hardened enough to lift the golem but not strong enough to punch through what was effectively solid metal either, instead settling around it's legs and lower torso like a perfect mould.</p><p>I could feel through the chakra resonation – and vibrations in the ground – as it hacked away at the rock and knew that it wouldn't hold long. I scrambled around it, a messy graceless stumble, and swept my unharmed hand over the ground until I found what I had dropped.</p><p>The sudden light of the lightsaber activating made my eyes water, but I hardly paused, coming up swinging. I struck awkwardly, but my lightning blade carved into it as easily as it had before. I braced my other hand on the handle, ignoring the thrum of pain it caused, and pulled upwards, shearing the thing in two.</p><p>Its chakra spluttered out, and it collapsed, lifeless.</p><p>I didn't have time to pause, turning to help Shikamaru. He'd done a good job binding it down with ninja wire, and now that we had light again his shadow jutsu were back in play. But like me he was clearly having trouble keeping steady on his feet, which wasn't an advantage in a fight.</p><p>I helped finish off Shikamaru's golem with a grunt, wavering slightly.</p><p>"Okay?" Shikamaru mouthed. Or maybe he said it but I couldn't hear.</p><p>I nodded, breathing deeply. We weren't done yet.</p><p>We closed the gap between us and them, bringing the remaining fight into clearer light. Naruto looked awful, dirty and beaten with a trail of blood leaking from his mouth. I hoped it was a 'sliced my cheek on my teeth' injury and not a more serious 'internal bleeding' one. Fugai slammed into him, all animalistic fury, throwing him back at us.</p><p>I moved sideways, letting him tumble across the ground, and slashed out with the lightsaber. Lightning gathered along the side and lanced out, whipping through the air at her. It was a more powerful version of Striking Bolt, simple but effective and it homed in on her metal armour with great alacrity.</p><p>She staggered under it and I swung again. Beside me, Naruto rolled to his feet, rubbing the blood off his chin with the back of his hand and <em> grinned.</em> There was something so fierce and pleased about the expression that I felt an answering smirk steal across my face.</p><p><em> Let's finish this, then.</em></p><p>Naruto clapped his hands together and multiplied. I spared an idle thought to wonder how many clones he had running around, but dismissed it. It wasn't relevant right now.</p><p>Naruto clapped his hands together. "Shadow Clone Kunai Barrage!" His voice sounded a little muffled to me, but it meant I was getting my hearing back.</p><p>The kunai rattled against the metal of her armour, some of them finding chinks, but Fugai just snarled, low and vicious. It was hard to read any emotion but 'pissed off' on her muzzle. She charged forward, unwilling to retreat, with a blur of speed that was faster than I expected.</p><p>It wasn't enough, though, because neither Shikamaru nor I were still occupied with other fights. And getting into close quarters with a Nara was just asking for trouble.</p><p>I couldn't make hand seals while holding the lightsaber, but I'd had more than enough practicing at activating my shadow without them. Actually paralyzing her in the jutsu might have been a different story, but Shikamaru was right there, joining his shadow up on the other side.</p><p>"Rasengan!" Naruto cried, slamming his attack into her.</p><p>I felt the reflected force, pushing me back, but held in place. If she'd recovered once, she'd recover again, and we didn't need to go through this again. So instead of simply being thrown backwards, the Rasengan ground into her, the screech of warping metal giving way to something softer and more disturbing.</p><p>She sagged into our hold, body reverting out of its transformation. Her eyes were still open though, and her chest – however ruined – still struggled to draw in air.</p><p>"I will," she wheezed, "kill you. For Haido-sama."</p><p>She shouldn't have still been alive, let along talking. And her chakra was still humming strongly, bound up in the music of the Gelel. In fact… it looked like her wound was healing. Not as fast as Naruto's had when he had been bursting with Kyuubi's chakra, but still at a visible pace.</p><p>Another few minutes and she would be fully recovered. That wasn't good. If she could just keep going, if she was effectively immortal, we were in a whole lot of trouble. We couldn't keep fighting her. Eventually we'd just… run out of steam.</p><p>It would depend if her energy was infinite or depletable. The Sound Four had only been able to hold their transformations for so long, but I was wary about drawing too many parallels when the causes weren't the same. Who knew how these stones worked.</p><p><em> The stones…</em></p><p>The curses seals were <em> seals</em> , fully integrated into the individual, but the stones were merely objects. Could it be as simple as removing it from her person?</p><p>"What's that guy good for anyway?" Naruto complained.</p><p><em> Keep her talking, </em> I thought encouragingly. It would give us more information, and more time to work out what to do.</p><p>"A person like you will <em> never</em> understand," Fugai hissed back.</p><p>She wasn't carrying anything obvious like Temujin's sword, and for it to have transformed her, she probably needed to be in contact with it. It could be in her armour somewhere, though if it was, it wasn't showcased.</p><p>I caught Shikamaru's eye, trying to convey that I was about to do something and that he'd have to hold the Shadow Possession himself. That shouldn't be a problem unless she was able to transform again, or he ran out of time.</p><p>I already knew that the stones resonated with my chakra, so the easiest way to find where she was hiding it would simply be to diffuse chakra around her until it caused a reaction. Yes, it would probably send a signal, but it was unlikely to be more than what the fighting had already given.</p><p>I disengaged my shadow from her feet and started climbing it up, covering her legs. It wasn't the solid restriction of the Shadow Neckbind Jutsu, and it wouldn't actually do any damage, but it was sufficient for my purposes.</p><p>There was no reaction as my chakra wound around her torso, or down her arms, and I actually thought that my assumption was wrong and it wasn't going to work. Then I covered her neck and a clear strong note rang out from the base of her throat.</p><p><em> Bingo.</em></p><p>I cut my jutsu and walked forward until I was close enough to clasp my hand around her neck. There was no telltale bump or bulge beneath the skin, the way there should have been if the stone was inset there. I let a diagnostic jutsu seep into her skin but found that there was no evidence of pressure on the trachea or blood vessels either. Yet the stone was there, I could feel it as my chakra brushed against it. It was there, yet not, almost as if it had no physical presence at all.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Fugai demanded, sounding spooked. And no wonder, she had to know where the stone was and what it did for her. If I removed it, she would be powerless. Well, I amended, right now she would probably be dead without it to heal the damage she had sustained.</p><p>I hesitated at that thought, stepping back.</p><p>It wasn't that I <em> couldn't</em> . I was fully aware that I could. But was it necessary? It was one thing, in the heat of the moment, to do everything that you needed to stop an enemy. It was very different to make a considered, rational decision to kill someone you had already stopped.</p><p>I didn't really want to be the kind of person that made that call easily, when there were other options available.</p><p>The sun was – <em> finally</em> – starting to come up, bathing everything in grey pre-dawn light. It was enough to see by, anyway, so I flicked off my lightsaber and tucked it away.</p><p>"You should surrender," I said quietly. "You are out numbered and out matched. Your regeneration abilities are strong, but not unbeatable, especially if your power source is removed. But you can surrender-"</p><p>"I will die before being powerless like that again!" Fugai snapped before I'd even finished. Her face was twisted with rage.</p><p>There was a surge in the music, beating out a tempo like a war drum, and light began to glow at the base of her throat, seeping through her skin.</p><p><em> Shit.</em></p><p>I didn't know what it would do, but it was clearly an attack. The options were to try and dodge, which would involve Shikamaru letting her go, but we couldn't even predict where would be safe or what kind of attack it would be, or to shut it down in the half a second before it went off.</p><p>I was closest. I was the only one that could react in time.</p><p>My hand went for my kunai, plunging into her throat and ripping upwards through the skin. My other fingers curved in beneath it, plucking the glowing stone straight out of her.</p><p>A short, fear filled scream ripped out of her, choking off almost instantly. The chakra faded from her body, and her injuries stopped their rapid repairs.</p><p>I sighed and stepped back.</p><p>She stood there for a second longer, before Shikamaru stopped his jutsu and she just kind of … toppled gracelessly to the ground.</p><p>"All that for this, huh?" I said. I stroked my fingers over the stone absently, listening to it sing. It was cool and dry, despite the fact that it should have been covered in blood and fluids.</p><p>"It doesn't seem like much," Naruto agreed.</p><p>Shikamaru didn't say anything, and I glanced over to him. He was staring back, something vague and unreadable on his face. He looked uncomfortable.</p><p>I straightened, tried to see what was wrong, then caught myself. There was an obvious explanation lying at my feet. Had Shikamaru ever killed anyone? I … didn't actually know. That probably made me a terrible sister. Not during the exams, and although people had died on our last mission, Tayuya had survived. By rights, the answer should be 'no'. He hadn't exactly been responsible here either, but even being present was probably disturbing.</p><p>Sometimes I forgot that the other teams weren't like us, they didn't have missions like our missions.</p><p>"We should pack up," I said instead.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We passed the border with no complications, deciding to head onwards to the sites of attack, rather than try to find an outpost.</p><p>The coastline of Land of Wind was the most densely populated part of the entire region. There were shipping ports and fishing villages and other sea going businesses. The land in general was slightly more habitable too, a rockier, sandstone vista, with intimidating cliff faces and gullies. While there were villages further in the desert – Hidden Sand most importantly – they were in general fewer and less prosperous. If Haido's people had attacked here like they had in Land of Rivers, they could actually severely damage the nation.</p><p>Even the capital was down here, though it was much further along the coast than the attacks were to take place, and much more likely to be able to defend from an offensive.</p><p>The sun was well and truly up by the time we closed in on the first town, and even with chakra temperature regulation I was uncomfortably overheated. It was surprising how dramatically the conditions changed with less than a days travel.</p><p>"Looks like we're too late," Shikamaru commented lowly, as we halted on a high cliff with a good vantage point. Already we could see too much smoke spiraling in the air and too much movement.</p><p>"Maybe not," I mused. "It looks like Hidden Sand has already arrived." Either they had an outpost nearby with excellent response times, this wasn't the first attack, or they'd already been in the area.</p><p>Regardless, it meant we were walking into a firefight and not a massacre. It was more dangerous, perhaps, but more promising at the same time.</p><p>Naruto didn't pause, just launched himself forward, rocketing towards the village. Shika and I exchanged a look and followed.</p><p>The closer I got, the more I could see. It looked like we were only <em> just</em> arriving after the fight had started. There was a huge metal ship - the same design as the stronghold – hovering just offshore, likely having only just disembarked its soldiers onto land. Even as we watched, it fired cannons, dull hollow booms with rising smoke clouds. They would have devastated the shore, but never made it that far. The sand of the beach rose up, thick and fast, forming an impenetrable wall that they slapped against.</p><p>There were two or three squads of Sand ninja fighting, and there was a familiar looking puppet dancing through the chaos, though I couldn't spot the wielder. Much more visible was the white and purple of Temari's fan, and we angled ourselves towards her in order to make contact. Or Shikamaru and I did, Naruto simply entered the fray, splitting off shadow clones as he went.</p><p>"What are you doing here?" Temari demanding, heaving her fan in an arc. "I thought I told you not to get into trouble again."</p><p>"I dunno," Shikamaru said casually, hands folding into a rat seal and shadow spiraling outwards. "It kinda looks to me like you're the one in trouble. Thought we could help."</p><p>Temari barked a laugh. "You think Gaara needs help in the <em> desert</em> ?"</p><p>Watching the way the coast line seemed to move, sand hovering above the waves and advancing outwards, ensnaring the ship and relentlessly dragging it ashore… made it clear that it wasn't Gaara that needed the help.</p><p>I was suddenly, extremely glad that we had faced Gaara on our turf and not his. In the desert, with effectively an infinite supply of sand and an infinite supply of chakra, his only limits were his frail mortal body.</p><p>It was a bit breathtaking to realize the sheer scope of that.</p><p><em> Kazekage.</em></p><p>Maybe he wasn't yet. And right now those limits were a lot lower than they could be, but with time and experience… he could make the whole desert bend to his will. Every dune a soldier, every grain of sand a weapon; how could anyone fight that?</p><p>I turned back to the fighting going on around us, sending my shadow out. The thing about having so many people in one place like this was that it made catching them easy. The tricky part was determining which ones you possessed and which ones you let move freely.</p><p>If there had been any stronger opponents like Fugai, it would have been a different story. But they were all Golems and it wasn't like Hidden Sand didn't know how to fight puppets. The usual method of 'attack the puppeteer' wouldn't work, of course, but they weren't on completely unfamiliar ground.</p><p>By the time we had finished, Gaara had beached the ship, dragging it ruthlessly and inevitably ashore. It disgorged another, greater, load of Golems, and a tall figure flickering with lightning that had to be one of the warriors.</p><p><em> Ranke?</em></p><p>Then the Golems were on us, and I fell into playing backup for a kenjutsu using Sand ninja. With so many bodies on the battlefield and not much time to pause and look around, it was hard to keep track of everything.</p><p>It was impossible to miss some of Gaara's fight, though, as sand rose up in giant waves, spinning and spiraling. The flicker-flash of Ranke's lightning techniques was just as distracting, creating momentary blindness if you were looking the wrong way.</p><p>Just from what I could see, I thought that Ranke might have been stronger than Fugai – or rather, better at combating ninja. There were definitely different techniques going on there, and the fact that she was fighting Gaara without being immediately annihilated had to mean something.</p><p>Belatedly, I realized that we should really tell them about the stones. The middle of combat wasn't exactly the best time for information sharing, but if the only way to stop the Gelel warriors permanently was to remove the stones-</p><p>The ground surged, sand whipping through the air and slamming down like a tsunami where Ranke had been standing. There was a brief crescendo of sound, as though it was gathering energy for one final burst, then fluttered out into silence, leaving only the fainter notes of the Golems. Which told me that I was getting better at distinguishing this, wasn't I?</p><p><em> Or, you could just crush them,</em> I thought. <em> That seems like it works too.</em> Whether he'd actually crushed the stone, or merely 'just' reduced Ranke to such pulp that it wasn't actually connected to her anymore – and wasn't that a thought – it seemed like Gaara's favored tactics were pretty much right on cue to deal with these guys.</p><p>"By the gods," the ninja next to me breathed. I wasn't sure if it was in awe or in fear or a mixture of both.</p><p>Probably both.</p><p>After that it didn't take long to sweep up the rest of the Golems. Almost literally as Gaara proved.</p><p>"Chizuru!" Temari ordered, closing her fan and flipping it easily up onto her back. "Take Asano and scout the area. See if there were any other shore parties we missed. Mahana, wrap everything up here so we're ready to move out."</p><p>The named ninja – I presumed – snapped out affirmative replies and darted off to do as they were told. It was… interesting that Temari seemed to be in charge here, given that she, like me, was nominally a Genin. Gaara, I could see no one wanting to argue with, but Temari wasn't nearly so intimidating.</p><p>It wasn't that I doubted her skills, exactly, but several of the other ninja were wearing Sand style Chunin vests.</p><p>We shuffled out of the way, regrouping to the side. Shikamaru was slouching, hands tucked into his pockets, but didn't look much more ruffled than usual. Naruto was Naruto. Apart from the grime, you could hardly tell they'd been fighting. Next to them I felt supremely battered.</p><p>"So," Temari said, stopping in front of us and cocking her hip.</p><p>"So," Shikamaru echoed.</p><p>"You're not seriously going to play the 'it was a social visit' card, are you?" Kankurou cut in, walking up to us, his puppet rewrapped and settled on his back. Gaara arrived shortly after, sweeping in with a swirl of sand. "No one is going to buy it."</p><p>Naruto chuckled, scratching the back of his neck nervously. "Ah, we're not really supposed to be here," he admitted. "But we found out these guys were going to attack, so we came to give you a warning."</p><p>"The thought is appreciated," Temari said dryly. "But you're several days too late."</p><p>"Our mission was in the Land of Rivers," Shikamaru clarified. "We ran into these guys after they'd attacked a village there. It's … pretty bad." He gave a quick but thorough run through of the situation.</p><p>"Well, shit," Kankurou summed up. "We thought it was Hidden Mist at first, but it didn't fit." Mist was the only one of the shinobi villages that really did any of their attacking by sea, so yeah, I could see the initial assumption.</p><p>"They're from further away than that," I said. "They're not from the Elemental Nations at all. They're looking for the mine that produces those crystals; that gives them that power."</p><p>I spread our map out, flat on the ground. A curl of sand wound over the edges, holding it flat so it didn't roll back up and I spared a quick smile for Gaara.</p><p>"They're working off an old map, pre-Hidden Village," I said vaguely. "There used to be an old trade route through here." There'd been major cities, by the look of the map, which had probably affected the locations that Haido had dropped his men and stronghold. He might have assumed that, even if the cities themselves hadn't lasted, the resources that had made them ideal locations to build in the first place would have remained.</p><p>"That's where they attacked," Temari noted, crouching down beside me. She tapped the circles I'd drawn.</p><p>"Right," I said. "Well, where they were planning to attack anyway. We confirmed a few, but the stronghold was moving in this direction so they likely started at the far end." I shook off the thought as irrelevant. "Anyway. This is where they're looking, but I don't think it was on the trade route itself."</p><p>If you went to all the trouble of never mentioning the location of the mine, you probably didn't sell stones out of the door. Yeah, if I had time to read the rest of the book, I could probably do more than make educated guesses, but I didn't. Then again, Haido had read it and this was the best he had. I wouldn't presume to think he was an idiot.</p><p>"Given the other landmarks… I think it's more likely to be up here somewhere." I circled another area with my finger.</p><p>"There's nothing there," Kankurou said instantly. "That's the Dead Wastes."</p><p>"Dead Wastes?" I repeated blankly. It wasn't a name I was familiar with at all.</p><p>He shrugged. "What it sounds like, man. The whole area is completely dead. There's no water, no shelter; nothing grows there and nothing lives. They say if you leave a corpse there it won't even rot."</p><p>"That's… interesting," I said with a frown, considering the map again. It was possible he meant that a body would simply dehydrate and mummify, but that wouldn't be unusual by the standards of the desert, surely?</p><p>"So no one lives there at all?" Shikamaru asked. "No one explores it?"</p><p>"No," Temari agreed. "It's avoided." She looked thoughtful too. It helped explain how something could remain a secret if it was in an area that people simply wouldn't go. "It's still a big area though."</p><p>"Then let's go!" Naruto declared. "We'll find this stupid mine before anyone else gets hurt!"</p><p>I chewed on my lower lip, considering. The mine wasn't really our goal, except in terms of keeping it out of their hands. "What's the status on the outposts?" I asked. "Have your clones reached it yet?" They ought to have, if they'd been moving quickly. Land of Rivers wasn't that wide, and we'd come further in the other direction than they'd had to travel.</p><p>"Huh?" Naruto blinked in surprise. "My clones? Oh, right." He looked like he was mentally shifting gears, attention focusing from one topic to another. "Yeah, they got to the outpost. But Hayama-taicho said they can't leave the outpost to help!"</p><p>"What did he say exactly?" I asked patiently. I hadn't expected they would mount an attack, given the current focus on maintaining border patrols, but a flat 'nothing' was a bit… extreme. At the very least I would have expected an extraction team for us.</p><p>"Um, that they had to look after the border first, in case they decided to go to Land of Fire. And that they weren't supposed to be in Land of Rivers anyway. But they were going to send a message to Baa-chan to see what she wanted to do. And that we should stay out of trouble…"</p><p>Well, it was a bit late for <em> that.</em></p><p>It would probably take a few days or more for anything to happen, either way. Messages had to be passed, decisions had to be made, ninja had to be found and deployed. And they weren't even directly attacking Fire Country, so the level of priority wasn't as high as the mess with Cloud. There'd probably be messages to Hidden Valley, which would take even more time…</p><p>We'd already seen the amount of damage that these guys could do in a few days.</p><p>I didn't really want to see more villages destroyed.</p><p>"Okay…" I said slowly. "What about Hidden Sand?"</p><p>"We're defending the coast," Kankurou said. "But we can't exactly take the fight to them out there. We can't fight them until they come close to shore, and we never know where that going to be."</p><p>"Unless we do…" Temari mused. "If the mine is their goal, then all we have to do is defend that instead of the whole coastline. They won't bother attacking the villages when their real objective is so close at hand."</p><p>I wasn't so sure about that, if they were <em> using</em> the villagers to power their equipment, but it would still be <em> less</em> than what it currently was.</p><p>"And," she continued, staring down at the map. "If the location is so obvious, they're likely going to discover it very shortly. It's better if we're there first."</p><p>And wasn't that an ominous thought.</p><p>"We'll go," Gaara rasped in agreement. "Mahana will continue the patrol."</p><p>"Awesome! Let's go!" Naruto cheered, pointing off into the distance. Then he paused and looked around. "Wait. Which direction are we going?"</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Stones of Gelel Arc: Chapter 70</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: I think Avicii's 'Hey, Brother' might actually be my Nara twins song. There's something bittersweet about it.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 70</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Hey brother, there's an endless road to re-discover.</p><p>Hey sister, know the water's sweet but blood is thicker.</p><p>Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you,</p><p>There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.</em></p><p><em> ~Avicii; Hey Brother</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The Dead Wastes were probably more impressive to someone that knew anything at all about deserts. To me, they looked about the same as the rest of the desert that we'd passed through to get here. Granted, we had travelled through a few variations – rock, rocky sand, sandy sand, a dried out old creek bed to name a few – and this did seem to be on the rockier side of the equation.</p><p>Then again, there was something I noticed about it, and that was the complete and utter lack of chakra in the air.</p><p><em> Nothing lives here…</em></p><p>The desert had seemed pretty bare of life to my eye, with the exception of a few small and lonely plants, a spikey looking lizard or two, and a snake basking in the sun. (Kankurou had also suggested that our heavy footsteps might summon a giant sandworm - apparently straight out of Dune - but Temari had just scoffed and rolled her eyes at that, so I was pretty sure he was joking.) But the natural energy in the air had differed little in volume from any rural area in the Land of Fire, suggesting that there was a thriving ecosystem however little of it I could see.</p><p>The fact that this place had no chakra at all…</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>Tentatively, I gathered a little chakra into my hand, holding it up at eye level. The blue glow seemed to waver, like a candle flame in the wind, pulling inwards to the Wastes. Despite my tight control, it was peeling off, dispersing into the air and being sucked away.</p><p>"Interesting," I said, more unsettled than anything. It seemed… active. This wasn't just an area with no chakra, it was an area where no chakra could <em> be.</em></p><p>"What was that?" Naruto asked puzzled, staring at the air.</p><p>"It's almost like something is drawing the chakra away," I said.</p><p>"Eh?" Naruto frowned. "But where would it go? Into a jutsu?"</p><p>I blanched a little. "Let's hope not." An area this size, for however long it had been empty? That would be an extraordinary amount of chakra. That would be… destructive.</p><p>"It's still a huge area," Temari was arguing with Shikamaru. "It'll take weeks to search."</p><p>"I should be able to get us close," I said, cutting in. "I can sort of sense the energy the stones use, so we won't have to search <em> everywhere.</em> "</p><p>"That's better," Temari agreed, grudgingly.</p><p>I thought about pointing out that she had agreed to come this far without even <em> that much</em> of a plan, but it didn't look like she would appreciate the reminder.</p><p>We set off again, and suddenly I was in the lead, taking us deeper and deeper into the Wastes. My lungs didn't like breathing this lifeless air, which was rich considering how long it had taken them to realize that chakra wouldn't drown them.</p><p>The Wastes were flat, bare rock more than sand, with cracks and crevices reaching downwards that sometimes split it valleys or gulfs. That was interesting in its own way, and not just in making sure we didn't accidentally step off the edge of a cliff. It almost seemed like this had once been like Land of Rivers, since water erosion and underground rivers were the prime cause of such cave networks.</p><p>There was no water here now.</p><p>Sometime in the afternoon, I started hearing the song of Gelel grow louder and clearer, which was a relief as it meant we were going in the right direction. I followed it, until it was so loud my bones felt like they were vibrating, and it was so clear that I could have named each note, had the melody had recognizable notes. I couldn't have begun to describe it but it was beautiful.</p><p>"Somewhere here," I said, after a few circles around. It had grown dimmer in each direction, so it must have been here.</p><p>It could have been anywhere. This wasn't flat ground, and it could have been hidden in any number of crevices or caves, or buried a hundred feet underground. Even with Naruto's shadow clones, it would take us a long time to search them all.</p><p>"Quiet," Gaara rasped, crouching and pressing his hands flat against the ground. Specks of sand danced around him, as if caught in a breeze.</p><p>When he stood, he seemed to know exactly where we were going, and lead us down and through twists and turns with unerring certainty. We'd climbed through caves before, in Hidden Waterfall, but those had been built or repaired for human use, whereas these were just natural accidents. It made the trip… interesting, but we were ninja and were hardly about to be defeated by the natural world.</p><p>"I feel like this should have been harder," I mused. We weren't quite in a cave –there was still sunlight spilling down around us – but two giant stone slabs were wedged together to make the area virtually inaccessible. Beyond that, however, was a structure with clear signs of workmanship. It might have been half collapsed, pillars worn and engravings and patterns faded, the stairs covered with piles of sand… but it was here.</p><p>"Why?" Naruto asked, seeming to be honestly puzzled that I considered finding the remnants of a long lost civilization in a day 'too easy'.</p><p>I stared at him. He stared back.</p><p>"Never mind," I said, slumping.</p><p>He looked curious for a moment longer, before shrugging it off. "Let's go inside!" He called, running up the steps. "I want to see what it's like!"</p><p>"Idiot," Shikamaru groaned. "You deserve every trap you run into."</p><p>But we couldn't <em> not</em> follow, so after a moments pause we started up the stairs too. Whatever I'd imagined inside, it wasn't like that. The outside might have been crumbled and time worn, but the inside was as clean and fresh as if people had only left the day before. It was wide open, a central hub with many branching corridors off it, and every available surface was heavily decorated. The columns were carved, there were mosaics across the floor and picture frames on the walls, like the most extravagant of temples or palaces. It wasn't dark, either, like it should have been with no sunlight. I couldn't see any light sources, nothing glowing, but it was like broad daylight in here.</p><p>"Creepy," Kankurou said, stopping beside me.</p><p>I barely heard him. If the Gelel was a song, then this room was a masterpiece of acoustics. It pushed at me from all sides, and I could feel the stone in my pocket beating in time like a second heart.</p><p>And despite Shikamaru's mutterings, it didn't look like there were any traps. Naruto was darting in and out of the corridors, exploring with eagerness, and we broke up and spread out to have a look around. I paused to look at all the carvings, which were incredibly detailed. Like the mosaic patterns on the floor, they seemed very geometric, but not rigid and repeating.</p><p>I couldn't help but reach out an awed hand to brush over them.</p><p>And then yelped, jumping backwards and pulling my fingers away as though burned.</p><p>It had taken my chakra! Just pulled it straight out of my hand! It had been so strong, like the pull of a riptide sucking you out to sea just when you thought that the water was safe. I hadn't been able to fight it, or resist it, chakra to chakra, and it was lucky I <em> could</em> back away.</p><p>"It's a seal," I said, astounded. The others had stopped at my first exclamation, wary of traps and dangers. "This whole place is a seal…"</p><p>With a new eye, I looked over the patterns and carvings.</p><p>And swallowed.</p><p>It was huge. It was complex. I didn't even understand what it was for. But it made sense. The Dead Wastes, completely lacking in chakra because it was all <em> here</em> , sucked out of the air to feed this monster of a seal, for centuries. Millennia.</p><p>Shikamaru cursed, low and vicious. "Do you know what it does?"</p><p>I shook my head. If seals were like languages, then this was written in some long dead tongue, and I had no Rosetta stone. And even if I could translate it, it would be like babelfish, a mess of poorly aligned words with no context or explanation.</p><p><em> People only think in so many ways,</em> Jiraiya had said. But what about a different civilization altogether? I was different enough, and I had still grown up here a second time.</p><p>"I vote for <em> not</em> staying in the cursed and abandoned temple," Kankurou said, almost immediately.</p><p>Even if Naruto wanted to explore, no one was really arguing with that.</p><p>We set up a small camp just outside, with no small amount of relief. We'd been moving non-stop since yesterday, and a rest was long overdue.</p><p>"They're not going to be able to get the boats here," Temari said in satisfaction, perched on a rock and still somehow managing to look sophisticated. "Which means all we have to contend with is the mobile fortress that you described. We don't know how many soldiers they can deploy, but this is an excellent area for ambushes. We should at least be able to engage without suffering too many losses."</p><p>Especially since they had Gaara on their side. Once they stopped playing hit and run with the coast line, they were done for.</p><p>I was starting to feel good about our chances for dealing with this, which is why I probably should have expected things to start going wrong. A beam of bright white light cut through the air above us, visible in the small parts of open sky we could see.</p><p>"Lightning?" I tried, not even sounding like <em> I</em> believed that.</p><p>We went up, sticking to the walls to ascend vertically, and cautiously peering out in case of a trap.</p><p>"You!" Naruto shouted, jumping up and pointing angrily at Temujin.</p><p>I blinked. How on earth had Temujin got here? Had he followed us?</p><p>He wasn't alone either, but the man with him wasn't one I had seen before. He didn't look like any member of Haido's entourage, older, shabbier and less well dressed. He was carrying the ferret that had started this whole mess of a mission, cradling it dearly to his chest.</p><p>I wasn't exactly worried about this descending into a fight. Temujin was so outnumbered, and unless he was leagues above the other Gelel warriors, we'd be able to handle him.</p><p>"Oh, the unparalleled shinobi of the Leaf and Sand," the old man wheezed. "You must help me-"</p><p>"Be silent," Temujin commanded, shoving him in the shoulder and forcing him to stumble a few steps forward. "Haido-sama is already on his way. There is no need for you to resist any longer."</p><p>"Leave him alone!" Naruto shouted. "Are you alright, old man? What'd this freak do to you?"</p><p>"Tricked, tricked and betrayed!" the old man said, sniffling dramatically. "He came to us in friendship, as though he were the ninja hired to bring Nerugui home-" He hefted the ferret to demonstrate his point. "Then forced us to give up the secret location known only to our clan!"</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. This was the man who hired us? And he knew the location of the Gelel mine? This was utterly, utterly ridiculous.</p><p>… but I had started hearing the Gelel when we met the ferret, hadn't I. Not when we ran into the base, or into the golems, but the ferret.</p><p>"It has one of the stones, doesn't it," I asked, woodenly. It wasn't even a real question.</p><p>"Nerugui has been with our clan for generations," the old man confirmed. "He was once the companion to the kings of the empire, and we were trusted with guarding him." He looked dolefully at us all. "The mine must never be recovered, do you understand? It's power is beyond anything humans can handle. Those stones are the reason that the empire was destroyed!"</p><p>"Power is only power," Temujin shrugged. "What matters is who wields it. In the hands of Haido-sama, we will build a utopia. A world without wars, where the weak are never trampled by the strong… That is all that matters. That is our dream."</p><p>"There is so much wrong with that that I don't even know where to start," I said, annoyed. It was good that he was talking, it gave us more information, but it was still utter bullshit. "What part of devastating helpless villages and kidnapping people leads to peace? That's <em> exactly</em> what you're telling me you hate. Utterly hypocritical."</p><p>"We had no choice," Temujin insisted. "Sometimes sacrifices must be made. We have made sacrifices too, noble sacrifices to make the world better. That is what it means to accomplish something."</p><p>"You don't get to decide what sacrifices other people should make!" Naruto yelled, which was exactly the same thing I would have said. "It's not <em> noble</em> , and you should stop acting like you know better than everyone else!"</p><p>I really kind of hated that all these bad guys used 'world peace' as their explanation. It seemed to tarnish the whole concept, as though every time they were proven wrong, it was proven wrong.</p><p>"The ends don't justify the means," I continued, tag teaming off of Naruto. "The means create the ends. Any rule that's built with such needless bloodshed will continue that way. You think Haido will <em> stop</em> giving orders to kill people, just because he has what he wants?"</p><p>That one at least seemed to strike home, and Temujin faltered for a moment. "Don't talk about Haido-sama that way!" he snapped. Not deep enough, then, it seemed.</p><p>"This… Haido," Gaara rasped slowly. "Who is he?"</p><p>"Haido-sama is a great lord of Rikujou," Temujin said, earnestly for one who was so stoic. "He is noble and very wise and has achieved many great things in uniting the nations of our warring country. Even I… My friends and I were rescued by Haido-sama when bandits destroyed our village. That's why we believe so strongly in his dream to free the world of wars. That is why I must recover the mine of Gelel."</p><p>I couldn't say the revelation made me terribly sympathetic. "Your village was destroyed by bandits?" I asked, deliberately softly. "So you're just doing to others what was done to you?"</p><p>There was a bit of vicious satisfaction at watching the words hit home.</p><p>It had probably blown the small progress we were making. But there was satisfaction.</p><p>"He must be one of the descendants of the royal family," the old man said dolefully. "They left across the sea many years ago and took with them the Book of Gelel and the last of the stones. Only the blood of the royal family can destroy the stones, so we were never able to do more than hide the mine. Maybe now it can finally be destroyed…"</p><p>"Incredibly interesting," Temari said drolly, looking anything but interested. "Are you going to come quietly?"</p><p>Temujin raised his sword, but the sand that Gaara had been steadily piling around his feet as we talked spread up and immobilized him. A ninja would have expected that.</p><p>"I would have preferred to have greater forces here," Temari said critically. "But I suppose we don't have to worry about how to lure them in anymore."</p><p>Haido being on his way might have been accelerated from our plans, but it was basically what we were hoping to achieve in any case.</p><p>We tied Temujin up and went back down to our makeshift campsite. Now we were on a timetable, there were plans to make and traps to set. I didn't have much to offer, as the barren nature of the area made all my seals useless, so I spoke with the old man a little. His name was Kahiko, and he was part of a caravan of nomads that had been in River Country. He had been the one to hire us to retrieve the ferret – named Nerugui- which made me slightly regret our decision to abandon the original mission. If we'd ended up meeting him first, could we have learnt all about the stones and Gelel beforehand? Then again, the decision we'd made had been reasonable with the knowledge that we'd had and who knows what other events might have occurred.</p><p>All offers to take him to a safe distance, however, were rebuffed with melodrama that reminded me sharply of Tazuna. As much as I'd ended up liking the bridge builder, it was clear that Kahiko had his own agenda, whatever it might have been. I felt like throwing my hands up in frustration.</p><p>After that, it was mostly just waiting, and we took the opportunity to rest as much as we could.</p><p>"They're coming," Gaara rasped, just as the next day's dawn peeked over the horizon. The night had been <em> freezing</em> and I was almost glad for the return of the searing desert heat.</p><p>"Finally!" Naruto said, hopping up and peering around. There was nothing to be seen, but that didn't stop him from trying.</p><p>I made one last attempt to get Kahiko to safety – which he refused – and followed the others out to the places we'd chosen for fighting.</p><p>Like Temari, I rather wished we had more people with us. Especially when the stronghold came back into view, rumbling the ground like an earthquake and towering against the sky. It was moving quickly over the flatter ground; far faster than it had been in River Country.</p><p>We waited, tensely, until it hit one of the spots we had readied, and the ground caved in, a bare crust of rock hiding crumbly sand and open space beneath. It pitched forward, nose sinking down into the ground, treads circling without grabbing, and ground to a halt.</p><p>"Perfect," Temari said, heaving her fan in a wide circle. Winds blasted out, only gaining speed and strength as lashed across the open space, so that they carved deeply into the metal of the machine, more than one pipe bursting and spilling steam or simply being sliced straight off and clattering to the ground.</p><p>Sand whirled through the air, stirred up by the winds, but luckily was directed <em> away</em> more than toward us.</p><p>It made visibility poor, however, and when the golems came crashing towards us, it was only luck that one of us spotted the one flying overhead. Temari slashed at it with a sweeping gust of wind, but it dived agilely out of the way, low enough to see that it was not one but two; a twisted feminine warrior carrying the lord himself.</p><p>And they were headed towards the mine.</p><p>Temari broke off from the fighting to follow them, and I shared a quick glance with my brother before doing the same.</p><p>I wasn't exactly happy to leave the fighting when there were <em> so many</em> of them, but Haido outranked them in order of priority. And with both Naruto and Gaara there, they were unlikely to be overpowered.</p><p>Temari took another swing at the flying figures, and even standing behind her, I felt the kick back of the technique, then seemed to … falter. She stared ahead, eyes blank, wrists bending awkwardly under the weight of her Tessen.</p><p><em> Genjutsu?</em></p><p>I didn't know Temari well enough to know if she had a plan – pretend to be helpless under the effects and reel the attacker into a trap – or what her level of genjutsu defence was, but the Gelel warriors were fleeing, not attacking, and it was better to offend her with help than leave her stuck in it.</p><p>I altered my course, skidding to a stop beside her and clamping a hand down on her shoulder to disrupt the genjutsu. It was stubborn, and not-quite-chakra and I probably rattled her slightly harder than strictly necessary to break her free of it.</p><p>Then I took off towards the mine, because our targets had made great time while we were occupied.</p><p>By the time I got within range again, Haido was gone, Temujin was freed – again – and the disturbingly vampiric flying woman was swooping overhead.</p><p>"You must be really desperate to get your ass kicked by us," I sighed, as Temujin drew his sword.</p><p>"<em> Rising Thunder!</em> " A line of pure green light blasted out of the blade, curving along the path of his strike, as though the air itself was being cut apart. A note of Gelel sang out, pure and refined, ringing with strength and power.</p><p>"Wind Release: Wind Cutter Technique!" Temari called out, and as the two jutsu clashed they hung frozen in the air, just for a second, and I swore I could see where they met.</p><p>Then the blades of wind shattered and broke, flying back towards us on the wave of green light.</p><p><em> This is going to hurt,</em> I thought grimly as I threw myself at the ground – <em> into</em> the ground, though I barely scratched the surface as the leading edge of the attack passed overhead. But it had widened out into a wedge as it travelled, and I couldn't avoid it totally. Temari's scattered wind blades stabbed into the ground haphazardly, dangerous and uncontrolled.</p><p>I rolled unsteadily to my feet, feeling scraped and raw. Temari had sheltered behind the open lee of her Tessen, though she didn't look happy with the damage it had taken, and there was a nasty gash in the stone behind us that would make Shikamaru very annoyed to have to cross when it came time for them to follow us.</p><p>The vampire laughed, nauseatingly sharp and high pitched, looping overhead. "You said they were dangerous," she jeered at Temujin.</p><p>"Wind Release," Temari growled. "Great Task of the Dragon." The sky – I kid you not – went dark, with what was apparently <em> just wind</em> , which then descended upon us like some kind of tornado from hell.</p><p>I took one look at it and went 'nope'. I wasn't staying out in this. Temujin was standing between me and the mine entrance, but that was too bad for him because he was going to have to move.</p><p>Temujin might have been fast and had great reflexes, but a ninja moving at Body Flicker speed is all but invisible to the naked eye. Body Flicker was a burst of pure speed, almost <em> sliding</em> over the world, pulling yourself from one spot to another, done with chakra alone. You could start at a standstill, and finish at a standstill, in a different position to the one you started in, without having to do all that pesky <em> running</em> in between.</p><p>So when I mirrored one of Lee's favourite openings, appearing in a low crouch in front of him, and sweeping his legs out with a roundhouse kick, he was taken by surprise.</p><p>Then I made for the mines with as second Body Flicker, and didn't even look back to see whether he was following me, or caught in Temari's tornado.</p><p>The inside of the mine was just as eerie as before – maybe more so now that there was actual fighting going on and I knew that the Gelel was drowning out my ability to sense enemies. Which meant I couldn't rely on sensing to find Haido, and would have to use the old fashioned method of looking.</p><p>Ruefully, I wished we had investigated more closely, then at least I would have had a map and an idea of which way he would have been likely to go.</p><p>As I ducked into one of the side tunnels, there was a clatter of metal against stone, which at least told me that Temujin had followed. I wasn't exactly eager to confront him, regardless of what I'd said outside. We'd been running and fighting and running with little pause for days, and I was starting to flag. My hand, barely healed and then sorely abused once more, was a hindrance, my seals would not work due to lack of natural chakra, and unwary brushes against the seal work of the mine would result in chakra loss. It was not an ideal situation for fighting.</p><p>Hopefully, there would be a good spot or two for an ambush, and I'd be able to take him out that way.</p><p>I wasn't actually sure what I would do once I found Haido. 'Stall' seemed appropriate.</p><p><em> This is a right mess.</em></p><p>I moved onwards, trying to guess at which paths Haido might have taken. Down? Deeper into the mines? But he was hardly going to dig them out of the ground himself, was he? Depending on how quickly the fall of the empire had progressed, there might have been a store of stones kept awaiting sale… or they might have been cleaned out completely.</p><p>The volume of the music was making my head pound, and it was hard to think, like standing in the front row of a concert and trying to do math.</p><p>Then I heard the sound of raised voices echoing along a corridor, and realized I had found my answer. I couldn't make out the words – it was too indistinct for that – nor who it was that was shouting, but there could hardly be other people here at this time, could there?</p><p>I darted into the room just in time to see Kahiko stab Haido with a small dagger.</p><p><em> Kahiko, of course.</em> I hadn't seen him outside, but I'd assumed he'd just hidden when the fighting had broken out. But no, of course he was getting himself involved.</p><p>Haido yelled, a wordless roar, and threw the old man backwards. I moved to intercept; around the central plate we were standing on, the floor fell away, stairs circling the walls and descending far downwards. If Kahiko fell from that, he wouldn't survive.</p><p>There was a small dais on the wall opposite the entrance, with an empty pedestal. I had the feeling that it hadn't been empty a few minutes ago, and the greenish glow visible from Haido's hand seemed to confirm that.</p><p>I dropped Kahiko to the ground to keep my hands free, and hoped he didn't jump into trouble again. It hadn't even achieved anything, because the small wound had already healed with the regenerating power of the stones.</p><p><em> At least it's in his hand,</em> I thought. <em> Easy enough to cut off.</em> It wouldn't kill him, either, unlike Fugai.</p><p>"More interruptions?" Haido said, looking at me with a sigh. "Those children really are worthless. But it's too late. I already have the first stone of Gelel, the Heart Stone, and there is no longer anything you can do to stop me."</p><p>"Yes, there is!" Kahiko snapped, and drove his little dagger into the centre of the mosaic on the floor. There was a pulse of chakra, and it <em> rippled</em> , surging out from the point. "This is the Chamber of Sealing, and with the royal blood, this will destroy the entire mine! These legends have been passed down our clan for generations!"</p><p>And Haido started to laugh.</p><p><em> Oh, that isn't good.</em> I didn't know what he was laughing about, but it was never good when you revealed your trump and the enemy laughed. And… the seal didn't actually seem to be doing anything.</p><p><em> You could have told us this before, Kahiko!</em></p><p>"Fool! I have searched long and hard for these stones, they were not handed to me by birthright alone."</p><p>Well, it was too much to assume that they would have survived so long passed down from parent to child. It had been thousands of years. They could have been sold, stolen, traded, lost… any number of things. There wasn't even any guarantee that there were any of the 'royal blood' that still existed, nor that there actual blood would fit whatever parameters were designed into the seal. Good grief.</p><p>Metal clattered behind us, heralding Temujin's entrance into the hall. Behind him, a tiny furred face peeked out inquisitively, before churring happily and bounding through the room to curl up on the pedestal.</p><p>"Ah, Temujin. I thought I gave instructions to allow no one inside?" The reminder was sharp and biting. "No matter. Kill them."</p><p>And Temujin, wonder of wonders, hesitated. "Haido-sama? We have what we came for. There is no longer any need…"</p><p>"You always were too soft," Haido snorted contemptuously. "How many times do I have to tell you? They are noble sacrifices for a greater cause. Those who stand at the top have to make tough decisions, so the rest of the world may be drawn into a peaceful utopia."</p><p>"You mean 'so the rest of the world bows to your might'," I cut in softly. "You only say 'peace' to convince others to follow you."</p><p>"What does it matter? I have the stones now. If no one dares fight, then there will be peace."</p><p>"You will be a tyrant and people will always rise up to fight tyrants," I retorted. "Besides, those stones are not as powerful as you seem to believe. Maybe your home is different, but there are people here who could crush you, stones or no." If he thought we were the pinnacle of ninja ability, he was in for a rude awakening.</p><p>Still, I hoped it didn't come to that. Because having actual ninja get their hands on these was a far more frightening thought.</p><p>Immortal, endlessly regenerating ninja. It would be like Edo Tensei zombies come early. No, something would have to be done about it.</p><p>Haido glared darkly and raised his hand, palm facing towards me. I was moving before the blast of energy left his palm and impacted on the ground I had been standing a bare second before.</p><p>"Such power!"</p><p>"Haido-sama!" Temujin objected.</p><p>And Haido turned his hand on him. Unlike me, Temujin didn't move fast enough to avoid the blow, and it sent him tumbling across the ground, sword flying from his grasp.</p><p>"Hmm, I can't control it properly yet," Haido mused, seeming unconcerned about what he'd just done. "That should have killed you, Temujin. I really don't have any use for you, anymore, if you're just going to get in my way. Your sacrifice was appreciated."</p><p>Temujin rose up on hands and knees and was staring at Haido with disbelief. "You- you…"</p><p>There was light glowing on his breastplate, just above the heart. No, not just light, it looked like writing. A seal?</p><p>"The royal symbol," Kahiko muttered. "So it was the boy all along…"</p><p>Haido twitched his fingers, but instead of another blast of light, Temujin's swords started sliding across the floor towards him, with some speed. My jacket pocket pulled forward, the stone inside it seemingly drawn to Haido, but wasn't the target of the technique, and therefore not strong enough to pull through the material.</p><p>"This sword was one of the relics of the Empire," Haido said stooping to lift it. "This was what led me to you, in the end. Your mother fought in the battle of Fuchidoru, and there were many tales of her skills. I knew it was a power I must have. She refused to hand it over, for the betterment of all, so what happened afterwards was necessary."</p><p>Wait. Hadn't Temujin said his parents were killed by bandits?</p><p>Haido examined the sword carefully. "In the end, it was useless. The stone was corrupt, answering only to your family. But your mother also had a book, and that was much more valuable." He threw the sword to the side.</p><p>"You were the one that destroyed his village!" Kahiko said, verbalising what we were all beginning to realise. "You killed them all."</p><p>Temujin was staring in mute horror. I did feel sorry for him now. Maybe Haido had seemed reasonable, before they'd come here. Maybe the violence had crept up on them. But this was a lie right from the start, from before the start.</p><p>"But you no longer have the book," I said, carefully drawing attention back to myself. "Do you?"</p><p>That did it.</p><p>"Where is it?" Haido snarled. "You stole it, you thief!"</p><p>"If it wasn't yours to start with, how am I the thief?" I asked. I didn't actually want to provoke him into action, just distract him. I was perfectly fine with Haido monologuing as much as he liked.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Kahiko shuffling towards Temujin. I hoped he wasn't going to try the knife trick again, because I'd rather not have the entire place destroyed while I was inside it. Afterwards… well that was fair game.</p><p>I took a step forward, cautiously. My lightsaber was in my pocket, and all I had to do was cut off his hand. He hadn't mastered the stone, and so far its abilities had seemed straight forward.</p><p>"That book is the foundation for our new world," Haido said. "It contains the secrets to how to use the stones for a prosperous existence. If you return it, I will show mercy. I will even allow you to be part of our new utopia."</p><p>"Eh," I said, shrugging a shoulder. "I already destroyed it."</p><p>So much for not provoking him. I should probably have played along with accepting the offer and buying time to get closer.</p><p>I dodged the first blast, planted my good hand on the ground and flipped over the second, drew my lightsaber and deflected the third – which worked, and I didn't consider that it might not until the moment before it hit – and was close enough to swing at him when something hit me in the back and I staggered.</p><p>I blinked, confused. Temujin and Kahiko were to my side, I could still see them, staring in wide eyed horror. It hadn't been them.</p><p>My lightsaber went out, and tumbled from nerveless fingers.</p><p>I blinked again, slower and heavier.</p><p><em> That's not good.</em></p><p>My legs weren't working right. I fell forward, onto my knees. They jarred against the stone, but it was a distant feeling.</p><p>There was a shriek, like the cry of a wounded animal, and the air turned red.</p><p>Sluggishly, I raised my head – when had I dropped it? – and watched Naruto careen past me, making the air bleed. Red chakra snapped over my skin, and it should have been unbearable, but all I felt was heat.</p><p><em> Naruto is here. It'll be okay now, right?</em></p><p>"-he'll pull the place down around us!" Temari's voice said, warbling and wavering in my ears. She was holding Shikamaru by the arm, trying to drag him back out the door. But he didn't want to go, was shaking her off, and you couldn't make a Nara go where they didn't want.</p><p>"<em> Shikako!"</em></p><p>I struggled to get up. Shikamaru was never so upset, never sounded so hopeless. I just had to show him it was okay.</p><p>But there was something heavy attached to my chest, and it was so hard to move, I was so tired…</p><p>I reached up to touch it, fingers clumsy. It was cold, cold and metal, pressing out through my sternum. It shouldn't have been there. It was Temujin's sword, and it was in my chest.</p><p>Shikamaru crouched in front of me - when had he moved? - eyes wide and hopeless. It looked like all the pain I wasn't feeling was hitting him. Listlessly, I raised an arm, touching his face gently. Blood smeared from my fingertips across his cheek.</p><p>It was so hard…</p><p>"'Kako, 'Kako, come on, please," he was saying, just my name, over and over again. His hands fluttered, my shoulders, hands, arms, chest, shoulders as if he couldn't decide where to touch.</p><p>And it dawned on me that I was going to die here.</p><p>I was…</p><p>I swallowed, tried to say something. But there was nothing. What could I say? I'm sorry, I love you, I failed, I'm sorry, I don't want to go.</p><p>I didn't want to go.</p><p>Because I was going to lose this.</p><p>I was going to lose Shika and Naruto, Ino and Sasuke and Chouji and Sakura… I was going to lose mom and dad. I was going to lose feeding the deer in the early morning and the dawn peeking over the tree tops. I was going to lose shogi in the living room and feet under the kotatsu in winter. I was going to lose standing on water and defying gravity. I was going to lose lightning sparks dancing over my fingers and earth trembling underfoot and I was going to lose a shadow that moved itself…</p><p>I was going to lose the chance to make a difference.</p><p>I was going to lose everything.</p><p>Again.</p><p>It didn't matter what came after, if it was nothing or everything, the end or a new beginning… I was going to lose this.</p><p>I didn't want to go.</p><p>Shika was still talking, but I couldn't hear him anymore. The song in my head was too loud, and there was nothing else, anymore. But it was <em> beautiful</em> , and nothing hurt, and it was dragging me away into light. The tempo was like the beat of a heart, and the melody like breathing and it was warm and almost familiar.</p><p>But I… didn't want to go.</p><p>I wanted to <em> live.</em></p><p>And the light roiled and twisted inside me, filling me up, like a supernova inside my chest. I gasped, eyes flying open.</p><p>Because… it. The Gelel. It wanted to live too.</p><p>It had begun here. A long time ago. And there had been people here, always people, short sparks of life that lived and shared with it, tended to it and it grew. It lived. Maybe not sapient. But sentient. It had lived, and it had shared life with the little sparks, and they had lived longer and better, shining brighter. It had loved.</p><p>And then they had gone.</p><p>We had been alone here, and we had waited, waited for them to come back. And now they had, bright, shining life carrying pieces of us.</p><p>And then one of them cut out, candle flame guttering into darkness.</p><p>We cried out, a long note of despair. We did not wish to lose them, not to go back to being alone. We reached out, and we <em> knew</em> them. Shikamaru, Naruto, Gaara, Temari, Kankurou, Temujin, Kahiko, Nerugui… we knew them.</p><p>We could feel the anger of Kurama breaking against the seal. Like glass it was, clear and true, separating the two of them the way we were not separated. We touched him, soothed him – <em> time passes</em> – and he shone, clear and bright and alive. And we could feel the other, Shukaku, and we could touch him too, alive and eternal like us, as great and infinite as the depths of the universe.</p><p>Then… a note of discord. A shadow where there was nothing to cast it. Something that was not us, within us.</p><p>Shikamaru.</p><p><em> You would fight a god?</em> We asked him, curiously. He did not hurt us, could not hurt us. We were light and life, not mortal flesh to be injured or damaged. We were. We existed.</p><p><em> Yes,</em> came the reply, fierce and bright. <em> Give me back my </em> <em> <strong> sister.</strong> </em> He pushed and pulled and he was so small and nothing compared to the vastness of space, a drop of ink against the night sky, an ant trying to destroy a star.</p><p>His energy drained, little by little, fading away, life leaching out as he expended it in a fruitless struggle. For what?</p><p><em> Shikako,</em> he pleaded.</p><p>My name. For me.</p><p>We were –</p><p>I was –</p><p>I was caught in the center of a storm, torn and tugged in every direction. I couldn't hold on. I couldn't let go. I wasn't who he thought I was, wasn't who he was fighting so hard to get back.</p><p><em> Shikako!</em></p><p>I had wanted to be special, hadn't I? Wasn't this… wasn't this special, precious, terrifying, to know that someone would fight a god. For you.</p><p>So that you would stay.</p><p>I didn't… I didn't want to go.</p><p>I reached for him, and it took everything I had. The Gelel pulled at me, and it wasn't malicious, it wasn't, it was safety and light and joy and life and it was so hard, so <em> hard</em> , but I-</p><p>-let-</p><p>-go.</p><p>Light exploded upwards, a fountain of it, a column of it, pouring out of me and into the sky. It covered the sky in all the colours of the aurora, bright enough to be seen under the noonday sun.</p><p>I choked, trying to breathe, and Shikamaru's hands were on my shoulders, and he was crying, and my body felt wrong, heavy and ungainly and imperfect. I was hollowed out, burnt from the inside, empty and too full all at the same time.</p><p>Naruto was sitting, half collapsed, eyes wide and face pale. He looked uninjured, more awed than horrified. Temari crouched beside her younger brother, a half formed shell of sand protecting them both from falling debris. Kankurou, further away, had dragged Temujin and Kahiko to safety.</p><p>The temple around us was shattered and gone, and things were unfurling from the ground, growing things, grass and trees and flowers. I could hear water burbling up, a cheerful babble, as an underground spring refreshed.</p><p>I breathed.</p><p>It didn't hurt.</p><p>Cautiously, with great dread, I looked downwards. There was no sword protruding from my chest.</p><p>I touched it. There was nothing but solid, unbroken skin. If it hadn't been for my tattered, blood soaked shirt, I wouldn't have believed I was injured at all.</p><p>"We were stars," I said to Shikamaru.</p><p>And started to cry.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Well, this one's been a long time coming. The next chapter should be the last of the movie, wrap up and help explain all the things Shikako didn't really see.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Stones of Gelel Arc: Chapter 71</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 71</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Weep for yourself, my man,</p><p>You'll never be what is in your heart</p><p>Weep, little lion man,</p><p>You're not as brave as you were at the start</em></p><p><em> ~Mumford and Sons, Little Lion Man</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Shikako!" Naruto cried, scrambling across the ground to where Shikamaru and I were huddled. "You were- You're okay!" His voice was a painful mix of confusion and relief.</p><p>I blinked back the blurry tears clouding my vision. There was a lump in my throat, something thick and heavy, filled with grief and loss and slowly fading fear. "I-" I rasped. "I'm okay. I'm okay."</p><p><em> I'm okay.</em></p><p>If I said it enough, was it true?</p><p>Shikamaru's fingers were claws digging into my shoulders, a solid grip anchoring me in place. It was starting to hurt, but it made it feel like I was me again. Like I was settling back into this body, not some ethereal figure made of energy. The two of us were separated by flesh and blood, no longer joined by spirit and soul.</p><p><em> Oh, Shikamaru</em> . I closed my eyes and let my forehead rest against his shoulder. Just for a few seconds. Just a few. He wasn't letting me go. He wouldn't let me go. Not even if the thing taking me away was death. How had he even done that? How had he managed to reach me, when I wasn't even <em> me</em> anymore?</p><p>I shivered, muscles jerking and contracting under my skin, an uncontrollable impulse even in the desert heat.</p><p>The feeling was fading, of what it had been like. I'd understood things, then, but now it was like a dream. In a way, I supposed I was grateful, because it was <em> too much</em> even now, some kind of sharp and raw thing that wasn't meant for humans.</p><p>Naruto's hand tangled in my sleeve, and it was such a <em> young</em> move, such a childish request for contact, that I drew a deep breath. I was okay. I could do this.</p><p>I rocked back, sitting up and wiping my eyes clear on the sleeve of my jacket.</p><p>Generally, I didn't really like crying in public. It was too messy, too personal, and just because it was <em> understandable</em> didn't really make it any better. The fact that I wasn't the only one in tears didn't help either, it just let me feel embarrassed on their behalf too.</p><p>There was movement to the side, as the other moved now that the land had stopped restructuring itself. I flushed as I caught Gaara's eye, even though his expression gave nothing away.</p><p>The immediate fighting might be over, but we were still in the middle of a mission and it wasn't exactly appropriate behavior.</p><p>There went any respect I'd earnt from the sand siblings.</p><p>"We should move," I murmured, voice still raspy. "We've got a mission to finish." There were so many things that needed to be done, but the list of unfinished tasks didn't motivate me like it normally did. I just wanted to close my eyes against the endlessness of it all.</p><p>Shikamaru made a harsh, disbelieving sound. "You just <em> died."</em> His voice cracked heavily. "The mission can just-"</p><p><em> You just died. </em></p><p>Because, if we didn't move, I had to sit here and think about what that meant. About how close I'd come to losing everything, about how close I'd come to failing.</p><p>I'd thought I'd known where the danger was coming from. But this mission wasn't even on my list – wasn't anything I'd had forewarning about. And that was the kicker, wasn't it? This wasn't Orochimaru or Itachi or Pein. This wasn't part of the 'story'.</p><p>And yet I'd still nearly died here.</p><p>And it had been because of my own mistakes. I'd been tired, and distracted by the sounds I could hear. I hadn't taken Haido seriously. I hadn't been paying attention to my surroundings. I should have been able to dodge the sword when he called it towards himself, when it started flying through the air, but I hadn't even seen it. I'd forgotten about it.</p><p>I'd made a mistake.</p><p>And it had nearly killed me. It <em> had</em> killed me.</p><p>I drew in a shaky breath, trying to hold onto the little composure I'd regained. My eyes were tearing up again. So much for dignity.</p><p>"I'm sorry<em> ,</em> " I said, voice breaking. "But please-"</p><p><em> Don't make me do this here.</em></p><p>Shikamaru softened and drew back. "Okay," he murmured, eyes searching mine. "Okay. We'll finish this." He drew a deep breath. "We'll finish this, then we're going home."</p><p>I nodded, relieved he was letting it drop. Relieved that he was going to take charge and sort everything out. If it had been my responsibility, I'm not sure I could have managed. At the same time, I <em> needed</em> this to be done, needed to see it to the end and know how it all worked out. I needed it to finish.</p><p>I was just… teetering on the edge. On the edge of what, I didn't know, but too much pressure would send me toppling. And I didn't really want to find out what was at the bottom.</p><p>We stood together, which was slightly awkward as no one seemed to want to let go. I slid my hand into Naruto's. His skin seemed fever hot to me. Or maybe I was cold. I felt cold.</p><p>We'd missed part of what the rest had been talking about, though it seemed like Kahiko was fretfully explaining what had occurred inside the mine, including the details about Temujin's parents. Temujin's eyes flickered up as we approached, and I noticed with a start that they were green, not Sharingan red.</p><p><em> Did his stone vanish?</em> I didn't think it had been removed. Not before I'd been stabbed, anyway, and who would have had the chance afterwards?<em> Or is it just because the spirit of the Gelel is… gone?</em></p><p>"What have we done?" Temujin murmured quietly, face ashen.</p><p>"Invaded our country," Temari replied, with an ease that belied the impact of her words. "Killed a lot of people. Attacked shinobi of Suna and the Hidden Leaf. Attempted to release some kind of ancient chakra beast." She drummed her fingers against her leg and arched an eyebrow. "Answer your question?"</p><p>Temari, clearly, didn't do sympathy.</p><p>He stared at her, eyes slightly over wide. "There is no apology I can give," Temujin said, eventually, "for those actions."</p><p>Temari snorted. "You've got that right," she said, leaning on her closed fan. "An apology isn't going to cover it."</p><p>"The only thing I have is my life," Temujin said, bowing his head. "Take that, then."</p><p>To me, that seemed to be a slight over reaction. But then, this was a world where suicide – seppuku – would wipe the slate clean, regain lost honour and make things better. It was a mindset I had never assimilated. To me, all it seemed to do was leave one more body to be buried.</p><p>Naruto's hand tightened on mine, likely out of surprise. "You're just giving up, just like that?" He interjected, slightly bitterly. "After everything you've done here? Everyone you've <em> hurt?</em> All your big talk about bringing peace and a better world, it means nothing to you?"</p><p>Temujin didn't move, but he closed his eyes. "I was mistaken. Haido-sa…" he choked. "Haido's utopia was no utopia at all."</p><p>"So <em> what?"</em> Naruto shouted. "You think that guy's way is the only way to do things?"</p><p>Shikamaru shifted on my other side, subtly. He was looking at Naruto, not <em> quite</em> surprised, but something indefinable in his features. Yeah, Naruto had that effect on people, when he got serious like this.</p><p>Kankurou frowned. "It doesn't really matter if he gives up or not," he pointed out. "From now on, he's a prisoner of Suna. He's not really going to get a chance to do anything else." Cynically, he added, "It might be better for him if he is resigned to it."</p><p>Gaara looked vaguely troubled by the whole conversation, though it was hard to tell.</p><p>"Regardless," Temari cut in. "That's the least of our worries right now. There's still an invasion going on out there. The longer we waste here, the longer that goes on."</p><p>"Is there any way to contact the rest of your fleet?" Shikamaru asked Temujin bluntly. "You called them here, so you must have some kind of signal." It was the simplest solution to the problem, if Temujin could order them to stand down from here. Or if we could fake Haido ordering them to stand down. If there was communication, there were options.</p><p>Temujin blinked. "Ah." He licked his lips. "Yes. There's a communication array in the stronghold. But. The only ones who could use it were those with the stones…"</p><p>Kankurou made a face. "Great," he muttered. "Like we'll trust you to do that." I didn't think Temujin would try anything. He was done. He had given up. It was possible they wouldn't even work anymore, anyway. Still, attempting would cost us very little, and mostly only in the way of time.</p><p>The other option was heading back to the shore and attempting to stop whatever ships remained, one by one. That would be a much longer siege.</p><p>"I say we just knock him out," Kankurou said, mulishly, "and if we <em> need</em> one of those stones, we could make sparky over there give it a go." He used his thumb to gesture over his shoulder at me. Shikamaru made a small sound somewhere between surprise and outrage.</p><p><em> Sparky?!</em></p><p>Gaara held up his hand. "Wait," he rasped. He stared at Temujin for a very long and unnerving moment. "If we take you to the stronghold, will you give the order to stop?"</p><p>Temujin nodded. "It wasn't supposed to be like this," he said, misery creeping into his voice.</p><p>"You're sure, Gaara?" Kankurou asked quietly. He shifted uneasily, readjusting the weight of his puppet.</p><p>"It's not so different," Gaara rasped, "from what we did. We attacked the Hidden Leaf, caused pain and suffering… I thought it was the only way to validate my existence, but I was wrong. We were defeated, and we found that it wasn't just strength that mattered in a fight. It was the bonds between people that mattered."</p><p>"Well, yeah," Kakurou agreed. "But-"</p><p>"We were given a second chance," Gaara continued, cutting him off. He turned, slightly, so he was looking towards us. "Even though we were clearly your enemies, had attacked your village and hurt you, you let us go, so that we could attempt to fix our mistakes and become better people. You showed us mercy. Because of that, we have become allies and both our villages have benefited."</p><p>Naruto laughed awkwardly, and scratched the back of his head. "Well, we are friends," he offered, a little uncertainly.</p><p>Gaara's expression did something complicated, where it seemed to soften and firm with resolve at the same time. "It's not so different," he repeated. "Only this time, we are the ones who can offer a second chance."</p><p>Temari didn't look happy, though whether that was at the reminder of their defeat, or at Gaara's decision, I couldn't tell. Kankurou just seemed resigned.</p><p>"Temujin. Tell your fleet to stand down and bring this fighting to an end."</p><p>Someone had made a decision. That was really all I cared about right now. In an undertone, Shikamaru directed Naruto to go and fetch our bags. We'd stashed them away outside the mine before the fighting had started, and hopefully they would have survived the destruction. I really hoped so, actually, because I could use a clean shirt.</p><p>And I was trying not to think about what my shirt was wet with. It was sticking uncomfortably to my chest. And it was <em> warm.</em></p><p>It would have been less disturbing if it was cold, maybe.</p><p>"Are you sticking around?" Temari asked, cocking an eyebrow at Shikamaru.</p><p>He shrugged. "Even if we left now it would still take us three days to return to Konoha," he replied. "So we might as well stay and see what happens with the rest of the fleet. That way we can give a full report to Hokage-sama about the situation." It was sound reasoning, clear and understandable, said in a manner that was just a little detached. If it hadn't been for the arm slung around my shoulder, I might have even bought it too.</p><p>She shrugged. "Suit yourself." But she did look at him oddly, so I didn't think Temari really brought it either.</p><p>Truthfully, if the Gelel hadn't healed me fully – as it seemed to have – then rushing home for medical treatment would have little effect on that. We'd never make it in time for it to be useful. The only benefit would be in avoiding future conflict, and we'd risk that anyway by rushing back through River Country without making sure the fleet was dealt with.</p><p>When Naruto came back, I apologetically slid out of Shikamaru's hold and grabbed my bag from him. It was a little battered, but everything seemed to be intact.</p><p>"Be right back," I muttered, ducking away somewhere for some privacy.</p><p>I rifled around in my bag, pulling out a change of clothes and ignoring the Book of Gelel that was haphazardly crammed in there. I'd have to do <em> something</em> with that later, but I just… couldn't muster the energy right now. I changed shirts – carefully cleaning away the flaky blood over skin that was slightly pink and sensitive, but otherwise unscarred – and regretfully disregarded my jacket as a goner. The front zip was busted, and there were tears in it, but the major problem was the giant red bull's-eye stained into the back. I shivered, and hastily scrunched it up and shoved it in my bag.</p><p>I didn't have a spare jacket and it was funny how lack of a single layer of clothing made me feel so much more exposed. I swung my backpack on and absently scrubbed at my arms as I wandered back towards the group. It was ridiculous, really. A jacket was no protection at all, when jutsu could carve stone. And it wasn't even like I was underdressed compared to everyone else – all that was really visible was my inked up arms.</p><p>Everyone was ready to go, but didn't look like they were <em> exactly</em> waiting for me to hurry up, so that was good. Shikamaru had a familiar cylinder in his hand, which I took in relief. It probably wouldn't be very good to have lost my sword on the second mission I took it on, would it?</p><p><em> Tsunade would probably be pissed. </em></p><p>Oh, she was not going to like this mission report, really. Not at all.</p><p>We didn't run, because we had Kahiko and Temujin with us, and that was probably a good thing, because I didn't have any chakra. It was funny, I didn't feel… that badly off. There <em> was</em> exhaustion, but it was more the mental and emotional type, rather than limb shaking and sleepiness. Still, after what had happened, a little chakra loss was hardly unexpected.</p><p>"Are you cold?" Naruto asked in a whisper loud enough that everyone probably heard.</p><p>I stopped rubbing my arms. "Ah, it's fine," I said, perfectly aware that I <em> shouldn't</em> be cold. I should, probably, be worrying about heat stroke and sunburn if I didn't have chakra to regulate with.</p><p>But I felt cold.</p><p>Naruto wiggled out of his jacket, leaving himself in only Chunin vest over mesh shirt. "Here," he said, shaking it out and offering it to me.</p><p>I made motion to resist again, then gave in at the stubborn set of his jaw. Orange wasn't exactly my colour, but I'd take what I could get.</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p><em> Oh, if Ino could see me now. </em> Although, actually, I was pretty sure Ino would find the jacket the least of all worries.</p><p>"I could carry you," Naruto suggested about a hundred meters later. "If you- if you're tired or anything." He bit his lip, looking worried.</p><p>"I'm fine," I said.</p><p>One foot in front of the other. That's all I needed to do. Just keep walking. It wasn't far away, even counting the way that the ground had been reshaped, and it was now grassy hills instead of rock and sand.</p><p>There was movement around the stronghold, however. I didn't think that the others would have left any of the golems behind them, but it was possible that they had only just arrived. Or were newly created.</p><p>Temujin stepped forward. "Wait," he said, as the golems turned towards us. "My friends… the fighting is over. Lay down your weapons."</p><p>It was tense for a moment, then, almost as one, they did as asked.</p><p>"They're your friends?" Naruto asked, eying the golems curiously.</p><p>Temujin nodded. "Many of us were from the same village. Haido took us all in, after…" he trailed off.</p><p>There wasn't much more to say to that.</p><p>Temujin led us inside, walking confidently through the halls of the stronghold. At my side, Shikamaru was tense, but even if this was a trap, we'd already shown that we could take them on. I didn't think it was, anyway.</p><p>The room he led us to was crowded with all of us there. There was some kind of radar like display to one side, and some kind of sound board with numerous dials and switches. Temujin adjusted a few with practiced ease, and brought an old-fashioned microphone towards his mouth.</p><p>"This is Temujin to all members of the fleet. Please stand down. Disengage from all combat and await further orders." He took a deep breath. "Haido is dead. We have surrendered."</p><p>There was nothing but the crackle of radio for a moment, then replies started coming in. Thankfully, they were all 'affirmative'.</p><p>"And the villagers," Shikamaru mentioned, voice a low rumble. "You'll release them." It wasn't so much a suggestion as a fact.</p><p>Temujin nodded. "I- yes, of course."</p><p>That took much longer. Temujin could cut the power draining from the pods that they were in, but they had to be all individually released and removed. It wasn't just the villagers, either. The golems were controlled by people who were also in stasis, and with the sudden lack of power they also had to be removed. Even after the power was cut, everyone was still unconscious, and we took several trips to bring them outside.</p><p>And then had to repeatedly explain and calm people down as the civilians started waking up, disorientated.</p><p>I smiled for the thousandth time. "You're all safe now," I repeated. "Everything is okay. We'll sort things out and get everyone returned to their homes."</p><p>"They destroyed it all!" One man said. "I saw it!"</p><p>I paused. The village we had come across had been unlivable, that was for sure. What were we supposed to do about that?</p><p>"We will help you rebuild," Temujin offered. "It will not be the same as it was, but perhaps… we can make some amends for what has happened."</p><p>It was a good offer. It helped the civilians, it showed that Temujin was willing to make amends. It helped refocus his priorities. It was a <em> really </em> good offer, actually. There was no denying that.</p><p>Except…</p><p>It might not be.</p><p>I squinted against the sunlight, and located Gaara. He was to the edge of the clearing we had deposited the villagers in, standing on the edge of a rough cliff, overlooking the desert. I extracted myself from the people I was helping and walked over towards him.</p><p>From this vantage point, I could see the changes we'd wrought to the land clearly. I could have believed we were in Land of Fire almost, from the look of it.</p><p>"There are Suna shinobi on their way," he murmured, unmoving but acknowledging me with a glance from the corner of his eye.</p><p>I couldn't see anything. I couldn't sense anything. But I didn't doubt him. Besides, given our lightshow, I would have been more surprised if they <em> weren't</em> .</p><p>"Right," I agreed. "Temujin offered to help rebuild the villages that they destroyed."</p><p>"I see," Gaara said. I didn't know if that was approving or disapproving.</p><p>"It's up to you, in the end," I said hesitantly and bit my lip. "But, uh, I'm not so sure they should hang around that long."</p><p>He turned towards me.</p><p>"Even if the Mine of Gelel is gone, they probably still have a few leftover stone shards, if the communications array is any indication." Temujin's sword still had one, at least. Temujin himself might have still had one. "And… I think there are a lot of ninja that would really like to get their hands on those, if word got out. Plus, you might want to consider what people will think of Sand having an army camping on their doorstep so soon after the Invasion."</p><p>"That we mean to attack again," Gaara completed, voice low and rough.</p><p>"It might be taken that way," I acknowledged. "Especially if they're looking for reasons…" They didn't even have to <em> believe</em> it to use it to justify an attack.</p><p>I shrugged, and folded my arms around myself. "Just something to consider, I guess."</p><p>Gaara nodded and turned back to staring out over the land. I waited a beat, assumed the conversation was over, and was about to leave before he spoke again. "The Gelel. Is it gone?"</p><p>"Yeah." I cleared my throat of the rasp it had fallen into. "It's gone. It was… It's not like Shukaku or Kyuubi, who can hold themselves together if they're let go. Without the mine forcing it smaller it just … spread out. It's the air. It's the earth." I scuffed a toe against the ground. "You don't have to worry."</p><p>"I'm not," Gaara murmured. "It is… peaceful here."</p><p>"Yeah. Hardly the Dead Wastes anymore, is it?"</p><p>"It's a garden." Gaara nodded. "Life made from death." He looked pleased.</p><p>"Poetic," I said. <em> Shi Kara Ikioi-en.</em> The Garden of Life from Death. It was a better name than I would have come up with, anyway.</p><p>We waited until Gaara's reinforcements had arrived, then said goodbye and headed home. Everything wasn't <em> quite</em> finished but what remained was clean up and we had even less of a stake in that than we did the fighting.</p><p><hr /></p><p>By the time we set up camp, we were already back in River Country, though further north than we had been previously. We'd considered travelling longer and setting up camp late, but there was no denying that we were all tired. We could use the rest.</p><p>I fell asleep to the sound of crackling fire, and woke hours later when my body told me it was time for shift change, even if no one had roused me.</p><p>"Eh?" Naruto whispered loudly as I sat up. "What's wrong?"</p><p>"It's my turn," I said, also whispering. Nighttime had that effect. "Isn't it?"</p><p>Naruto shook his head. "Nuh-uh. You got hurt so you don't have to keep watch tonight. We decided."</p><p>I sighed and hooked my arms over my bent knees. I should have seen that one coming. "Are you sure? You used the Kyuubi's chakra and I know that makes you tired…"</p><p>Naruto hesitated. "Nah. It's fine."</p><p>I hummed, saying nothing.</p><p>"I wasn't going to say anything," he said in a rush. "Because you were hurt so it doesn't seem fair. But when… when you were…" He struggled with the words.</p><p>"When I was," I agreed. We didn't have to specify.</p><p>"Yeah. I was really angry. And… I guess I used a lot of its chakra. Even more than I used the last time against that bone freak." He made a face. "But you started to glow, do you remember?"</p><p>I didn't, but I guess that was a given. I'd <em> seen</em> light, so it wasn't much of a stretch to think everyone else had too.</p><p>"You started to glow, and there was all this light everywhere. And it kinda… went inside me and made me feel all warm. And the Kyuubi got really quiet and all its chakra just went away. I was inside my head – inside the seal, I guess – and I saw it. The light. And the Kyuubi. Normally I don't see it," he clarified. "Even if I talk to it in the seal. It's hidden in the dark and only teeth and anger. But this time I saw him." He looked pensive.</p><p>I couldn't think of what to say to that. "Ah."</p><p>"He does kinda look like a fox."</p><p>I cracked a smile. "I guess that's where the name comes from, then."</p><p>Naruto grinned back, eyes squinting into tiny crescents. "Kurama. That's his name, I mean."</p><p>"Kurama," I repeated, wondering vaguely if Naruto had any idea… But of course he couldn't. <em> I'd</em> encouraged him to this end, had asked about the Kyuubi's name back when he'd first 'revealed' he was the Jinchuriki. I just… hadn't expected it to happen so fast.</p><p>Not that simply <em> learning</em> his name meant that they would work together. But it was the first step along a road that Naruto wasn't meant to take for years yet.</p><p>I hoped…</p><p>"That's… wow." I was super eloquent, clearly. I tried to marshal some kind of train of thought.</p><p>"Yeah," Naruto agreed. Then he laughed awkwardly and rubbed the back of his neck. "But you should go back to sleep! I'll keep watch, no problem!"</p><p>"Right," I agreed. "I just have to-" I waved a hand vaguely in the direction of the trees, and slid out of my sleeping bag. "I'll be right back."</p><p>I wrapped his jacket around myself and ducked out of the campsite. I didn't go far, just enough to have a bit of privacy to go toilet, but I didn't head back immediately afterwards.</p><p>Because I still couldn't feel my chakra.</p><p>By now it should have started to return, even if only just slightly. The fact that I wasn't showing any of the symptoms of chakra exhaustion only made it stranger. I just didn't <em> have</em> any.</p><p>I touched the spot on my chest anxiously, but it was healed. It hadn't come undone.</p><p>Then I reached for my chakra, the same way I had done a million times.</p><p>Beneath my hand, my flesh turned malleable, losing solidity and slithering in a way unnatural. I gasped, but no sound was made, no air rushed around, because I no longer had lungs with which to draw breath. My entire torso was transformed, blackly shifting shadows instead of flesh. It crept down my arms and legs, marched up my neck towards my face.</p><p>I jerked backwards, trying to get away from <em> myself.</em></p><p><em> Stop! Stop!</em></p><p>I panicked, trying to claw at it. But my fingers went through the shadow with only the barest sense of <em> pressure</em> , grabbing nothing. I tried to press it down, suppress it with my chakra, but I couldn't. I didn't have chakra. This <em> was</em> my chakra. The more I pulled, the stronger it was, the faster the transformation happened.</p><p>I was struggling, and that only made me pull harder, a reflex action, grasping at my chakra to strengthen myself against whatever enemy I was fighting.</p><p><em> Stop!</em></p><p>It was cold, crawling over me, out of me. It was shadow. It was darkness. It was the void.</p><p>Colour dropped away as the transformation completed. Sound dropped away. Everything was less vibrant, less real. The darkness of night became less threatening, my eyesight piercing it cleanly and completely. I had become it. I could twist and float away, nothing more than one shadow among many.</p><p>But… I was still me.</p><p>I waited, calming by the moment as nothing more happened. My mental grip on my chakra relaxed, letting it ebb back down to resting state.</p><p>I let it go.</p><p>The world snapped back into place. My body was flesh and blood once more. I gasped for breath. And then I started to cough, great hacking heaves that burnt my throat.</p><p><em> Don't do that. Don't do that again.</em> That had been… I didn't know what that had been. It wasn't a technique. I hadn't done anything. But it was a transformation, like the Gelel warriors had transformed. It was clearly linked.</p><p><em> Maybe it was a fluke,</em> I thought desperately, trying not to contemplate the scope of it. If it was caused by the Gelel, if it was permanent… then how would I be a ninja without chakra?</p><p>No. That was getting ahead of myself. I leant against one of the trees and just focused on breathing. I'd feel better when I wasn't hacking up a lung, and closing in on hyperventilation.</p><p>"Shikako-chan?" I heard Naruto call uncertainly. "Are you okay?"</p><p>I swallowed another cough. "Fine," I rasped back, starting to move. "Just swallowed wrong."</p><p>Shikamaru was awake when I got back, and I murmured an apology for waking him before slipping back into my sleeping bag.</p><p>Sleep was a long time coming.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We got back to Konoha three days later, skipping the outposts and making a beeline for the village proper. It was slow going because I couldn't chakra enhance and simply couldn't keep up a standard ninja pace.</p><p>That said, we didn't run into any complications, so there was a small bright side to it.</p><p>"You're instructed to report to the Hokage's Office immediately," the gate guard said, as we signed in.</p><p>"We have a team member in need of medical treatment first," Shikamaru said, hands stuffed into his pockets, and slouching.</p><p>The Chunin's eyes flickered over all of us, but he seemed willing to let that go.</p><p>Then another ninja appeared out of the crowd to 'escort' us to the Tower, and things started to go downhill. Common sense – and regulations – said that injured shinobi should be treated at the hospital before reporting, especially if said injuries were serious. If it was really bad and urgent at the same time, debriefing could be done at the hospital.</p><p>Except this guy was unmoving about the fact that we needed to report right now, immediately, ASAP.</p><p>And Shikamaru wasn't happy with that. He hadn't been happy all the way home, and it had just simmered under the surface. Someone was about to find out what happened when you really pushed a Nara into nastiness. You really didn't want a genius brain one hundred percent focused on making you just as unhappy.</p><p>"We can report in first," I said, nudging Shikamaru's shoulder. "Another hour isn't going to make that much of a difference."</p><p>He scowled.</p><p>"Besides," I said. "Tsunade-sama <em> is</em> a medic. We'd probably have to talk to her anyway." Because it was <em> weird</em> and crazy and probably well out of the normal limits of medical ninja.</p><p>So, really. Reporting to the Hokage would be much faster than going to the hospital.</p><p>"I don't like it," Shikamaru said flatly.</p><p>"Those are your orders," the Chunin said, equally flatly. "Your opinion is irrelevant."</p><p>I was starting to dislike him. I hoped he wasn't going to be someone we ran into repeatedly.</p><p>But when we got to the Hokage's office, Tsunade wasn't even there. The two village elders were, and an older man with one covered eye and an arm in a sling. Danzo. It could only be Danzo.</p><p><em> Shit.</em> I could feel cold sweat breaking out on the back of my neck, just from being in the same room as him. He had Shisui's eye, with its undetectable, mind altering genjutsu. He was the one that had sentenced the Uchiha clan to death. He was responsible for <em> so much</em> .</p><p>And my team mates had no idea who they were in the room with.</p><p>"Hey!" Naruto cried, indignant. "Baa-chan made us come all the way up here and she's not even here!"</p><p>I could feel my heartbeat picking up, starting to hammer uncomfortably in my chest.</p><p>"Uzumaki Naruto, Nara Shikamaru, Nara Shikako," Koharu said, giving us all a gimlet stare and ignoring Naruto's outburst. "This is your mission debrief."</p><p>"Who are you all, anyway?" Naruto asked, crossing his arms. "And why are you in Baa-chan's office?"</p><p>I made an aborted gesture in his direction. I didn't really want Naruto getting in trouble with these people. Especially not with Danzo.</p><p>The Elders looked offended. I supposed it had been a while since they'd had to introduce themselves, or run into anyone with Naruto's brand of bluntness.</p><p>"Idiot," Shikamaru sighed, stuffing his hands into his pockets. "They're the Elder Council. The Hokage's advisors. Koharu-sama. Homura-sama." He nodded at them both and left an empty, querying silence where Danzo's name should have gone. Maybe he didn't know it.</p><p>No name was offered. It probably flew straight over Naruto's head, but Shikamaru would have picked up on it.</p><p>I hoped he picked up on it. It wasn't exactly like I could tell him 'beware of Danzo'.</p><p>And it wasn't exactly like we could refuse to say anything. We could insist on reporting only to Tsunade, but I wasn't sure how that would go down. We had no specific orders saying we could only report to the Hokage, and theoretically we should have been able to trust them.</p><p>And we definitely didn't want to look like we had anything to hide.</p><p>"Where is Baa-chan?" Naruto asked again.</p><p>"Tsunade is currently at the hospital. I believe there was a situation that required her personal attention," Koharu said. "However, it has already been decided that this mission was to be upgraded to S-rank, due to the politically sensitive nature of your actions."</p><p>"<em> S-rank?</em> " Naruto squeaked in surprise.</p><p>I was a little surprised myself. While, yes, the most basic description of mission rankings involved the danger level – A-ranks were more dangerous than B-ranks and so on – there were other factors that counted. S-ranks were more likely to be assigned because of politics than because of the chances of running into S-rank shinobi. Put that way, an alliance with Hidden Sand to defend against an invasion of two countries from an unknown aggressor probably did count. I just… hadn't expected it. Doing A-ranks was one thing. S-rank…</p><p>No one did S-ranks as a Genin.</p><p>It wasn't done.</p><p>"Yes, S-rank," Homura confirmed. "As such, it is very important that we are able receive your account of events immediately and assess the situation for the benefit of Konoha. There is no time to waste."</p><p>"Well, we gotta do it quick," Naruto acquiesced. "Because Shikako-chan is supposed to be at the hospital."</p><p>I shifted uncomfortably in my borrowed jacket as three sets of eyes bored into me - three sets? Two sets and one? – and was grateful that I didn't look obviously injured. Then again, that might have got us out of this meeting.</p><p>"I'm sure it can wait," Koharu said dismissively.</p><p>Shikamaru took a short step forward. "We were arriving at Mizugiwa to complete our original mission, when we noticed a distinct lack of activity in the area," he began, tersely. "The town had been destroyed, and we estimated it to have been within the last day. We began a search of the area to determine if the perpetrators were still nearby. We located a large, mobile stronghold that they were using as a base, and decided to investigate further while Naruto sent a message to the border outpost via summons. In our investigations we discovered several more targets and decided to move on ahead in order to warn our allies in the Land of Wind. Once there, we took part in an ambush that defeated the leader of the army, and his subordinates surrendered."</p><p>"Those actions are well beyond your initial mission parameters," Homura noted.</p><p>Shikamaru nodded, face neutral. "Our Intel at the time suggested that reinforcements would take several days to arrive, so we were prepared to gather information for them. We were forced to act, however, when they spotted our presence, and when we found that there was a second force already attacking the coastline of the Land of Wind."</p><p>For all he was saying, there was a <em> lot</em> that Shikamaru wasn't telling them. And the way he was saying was heavily slanted. True, yes, but presented in such a way that we were less likely to get in trouble for it all.</p><p>"This army," Danzo said, speaking for the first time. "Where was it from?"</p><p>"South, across the ocean," Shikamaru said. "They believed that they used to reside in the Elemental Nations before the time of the Sage of Six Paths, but sailed across the sea. Their intentions seemed to be to return and subjugate their original homeland."</p><p>"The oceans to the south are supposed to be impossible to pass," Koharu said. "They would have had to sail through the doldrums and convergence zone…"</p><p>"Their ships were weird?" Naruto offered, a little uncertainly, not looking like he really understood what she was saying. I didn't really, either. "They were all made out of metal, not wood."</p><p>"First contact with a new nation," Homura mused, exchanging a look with his fellow Elder. "An unpromising beginning, but perhaps…"</p><p>"More importantly," Danzo interrupted, stepping forward, cane tapping on the floor. "Were they the cause of the atmospheric phenomenon over the north-east of Wind Country, several days ago?"</p><p>I swallowed. This was where we had to tread most carefully of all. "Yes," I said. "During the ambush, a relic was destroyed. It released a large amount of chakra, but did little damage."</p><p>"A relic?" Danzo repeated. "A weapon." His eye stared into me, like he knew I was lying. Like he could <em> see.</em> See what I knew about the mine, about the stones, about how they were created. See… about the book.</p><p>I froze.</p><p>The book. In my bag. That explained everything about the stones. About how they were created. That might, just, have enough information to repeat the process.</p><p>"I-" I started, voice rasping and breaking. I reached for my chakra to stabilise myself, to regain composure.</p><p>And realised what I had done.</p><p>I gasped, hands flying to my chest, folding over in half to <em> hide.</em></p><p>I ignored the cries of my name, then hands fluttering on my shoulders, and focused on keeping my chakra small and squashed in my chest. I couldn't let myself transform. Not in front of them.</p><p>Shikamaru's hand pressed in under my neck, fingers seeking out a pulse. I choked, fear and panic causing another surge of chakra that I repressed. I had to. I had to. I couldn't tell if it was working. I could only hope.</p><p>I couldn't let it go without calming down.</p><p>But I couldn't calm down.</p><p>"What is going on here?!" A strong, familiar voice called, door slamming open. I caught a glimpse of Tsunade in the door frame, Sakura peering out behind her.</p><p>"She doesn't have a pulse!" Shikamaru shouted.</p><p>A hand descended on my back, green chakra flowing into me.</p><p>Then there was nothing.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Yakumo Arc: Chapter 72</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 72</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The water in a vessel is sparkling; the water in the sea is dark. The small truth has words which are clear; the great truth has great silence ~ Rabindranath Tagore</em></p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Yes</em> , I thought, as I dragged myself into consciousness. <em> This is chakra exhaustion</em> .</p><p>It was too awful to be relieving, but at least it was familiar. It indicated that things were back on the right track and in working order again.</p><p>I felt like I had swallowed half the desert, and had the other half permanently jammed into my eyeballs. Opening them was like trying to drag a brick wall up a steep hill, and I ran out of energy half way up.</p><p>It was enough to see the white tiling of a hospital ceiling.</p><p>Figured.</p><p>My chakra sense was telling me there was someone in the chair next to my bed. Someone who's chakra buzzed and crackled in a familiar pattern. I rolled my head to the side, so I could look in that general direction. It took an unholy amount of effort.</p><p>He looked back.</p><p>"Kaka-sensei," I rasped to break the silence that was heavy enough to be uncomfortable. "You're late."</p><p>He flinched like I'd slapped him.</p><p>"Sorry. That was," I swallowed roughly, "a bad joke."</p><p>I tried to sit up, but managed only to lift my head off the pillow. Instead I limply raised and arm and twitched my fingers at him in an obvious offering. He didn't respond. After a moment, I gave up, and let them fall limply back to the bed. But as they were starting to droop downwards, he reached out to clasp them in his own.</p><p>"Ah. What's the damage?" I asked lightly, trying not to be scared of the answer. Kakashi-sensei wasn't the hospital visiting type. My thoughts bounced along frightening paths such as 'permanently crippled', 'never be a ninja again' and 'only a week to live'.</p><p>"You're going to be fine," he murmured after a long silence. I couldn't tell if that was the truth, or just what he wanted to believe was the truth. Then again, Kakashi-sensei was hardly the type for self-delusion, was he? If I was <em> hurt</em> , he'd say. Or at least, wouldn't be the one who had to break the news. Right?</p><p>"Thought you were on a mission," I said, instead. My fingers twitched against his, weakly. "You've been busy."</p><p>"I heard my cute little students were in trouble," he replied, eye crinkling into an obviously fake smile. "So I hurried home. But here you are, all safe and sound."</p><p>"Here we are," I echoed. I yawned, eyes sliding shut and ending up too heavy to open again.</p><p>Then the door slammed open and I found that, no, actually, I could sit up. Adrenaline did that. I was sharply aware of everything from the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunlight streaming through the window, to the shifting of bandages wrapped around my chest, to the garbled echoes of voices from further along the hospital.</p><p>I was exhausted but that didn't mean I was helpless; I could probably take anyone who assumed I was by surprise, if I was fast enough. The closest weapons to me were Kakashi-sensei's – I had no idea where mine were - but at a pinch, the chair, bedside table and bed itself would probably work. I had a clear run to the window, which was probably my best bet, if Kakashi-sensei would delay-</p><p>Tsunade-sama stalked in, looking irritated and glaring at sensei. "I said 'no visitors'," she ground out. "It wasn't a suggestion; it was an <em> order."</em></p><p>Kakashi-sensei shrugged his shoulders in a manner that said he gave precisely no fucks about her orders.</p><p>Tsunade narrowed her eyes at him. "Hatake," she said, warningly. It dripped out, viscously, and flooded the room.</p><p>I tried very hard to discover invisibility. This was not an argument that I wanted to be caught in the middle of.</p><p>"She's my student," he muttered, sounding sullen.</p><p>"And you can wait outside like the rest of them," Tsunade snapped. "I shouldn't have to tell you what 'classified' means!"</p><p>"I don't care about <em> classified-</em> "</p><p>"Out!" Tsunade pointed a single finger towards the door, and held it until Kakashi-sensei sullenly rose and shuffled out of the room.</p><p>Then she sighed, a long aggravated sound. Her heels clicked on the tile floor as she strode forward, in a way that had to be deliberate for a shinobi. But her touch was gentle as she propped a pillow behind me and let me sit, and then swept green chakra through my system.</p><p>"That bad, huh?" I rasped, aiming for joking and missing by a wide margin.</p><p>Tsunade arched an eyebrow. "You did die," she said, voice mild now. "The second time this week, according to your brother."</p><p>I gaped at her. "Died?" I squeaked.</p><p>I had <em> not.</em></p><p>"You were," Tsunade said clearly, "so chakra exhausted, that you were no longer producing any. That alone is enough to declare death, and that's not even mentioning the cardiac arrest you went into on the floor of my office. No chakra, no pulse, no breathing," she ticked off on her fingers. "I'm not even sure I'd get neural activity from you on a good day."</p><p>I closed my mouth with a click. When you put it like that…</p><p>Although, calling me brain dead was a bit far. Not enough to get me to say anything to an obviously annoyed Tsunade but, yknow, unfair.</p><p>"My chakra's been like that for a few days?" I offered meekly. "So it's not really so bad?"</p><p>"I figured," she said dryly, clicking a small sample container down on the bedside table. I craned my neck to look at it. A small rectangular stone, about the size of my pinky finger rattled around the inside. I knew instantly what it was and where it had come from.</p><p>It was a stone of Gelel. And it had been in me.</p><p>"<em> This,"</em> Tsunade said pointedly. "Was retrieved from your Eighth Chakra Gate. It was blocking or absorbing all of your chakra. You're lucky I was able to detect an anomaly in your system, otherwise you'd never be able to mold chakra again."</p><p>I shivered a little, at the thought. That would have ruined everything. Without chakra, I couldn't stand against the threats that were coming. Couldn't protect Sasuke and Naruto. Couldn't do anything.</p><p>But…</p><p>The Gelel warriors had been able to use techniques to attack us. They hadn't been that much weaker than us, in the end. With proper training… I would have been able to manage. I might have even been able to turn it towards even greater strength.</p><p>Because I'd turned into shadows. It had been a full and proper transformation. That level of control was restricted to A rank techniques – or bloodline limits. The Hozuki clan from Hidden Mist; able to turn into water. Konan; paper. Kakuzu; thread. It was a powerful ability, one that might have appealed to me if I hadn't been so quick to panic. Our clan oath even said 'become one with the shadows' did it not?</p><p>And it had healed me of a mortal wound. That ability to regenerate, like Fugai had when we had as good as killed her would have been exceptionally handy.</p><p>I hadn't really wanted it. But now that it had been taken away, before I'd even had the chance to <em> try…</em></p><p>Well.</p><p>"Tell me what it was," Tsunade said, making me tear my eyes away from my stone.</p><p>I coughed, accepted a drink of water, and started. "Before the Sage of the Six Paths, there was an empire that spanned the Elemental Nations. These people didn't have ninjutsu as we know it, but seemed to have a source of power that they used to strengthen their nation. It was, I think," I hesitated, twisting my fingers around. "They dammed a dragon vein."</p><p>Dragon veins were what I would have called ley lines. Areas of land that had high concentrations of chakra running through them. I'd looked up the subject after our trip to the Land of Snow had made them of interest, though there had been little to find. Some people were said to be able to use them to bolster attacks, though that sounded rather like limited senjutsu.</p><p>"They created a huge seal, incredibly intricate and detailed, and blocked the flow of chakra so that it all pooled together. And then they compressed it until it crystalized."</p><p>If you had enough chakra, you could make light. If you had more it could even be solid, like Naruto's Rasengan. The next step… or step after, would be crystal. The amount of chakra, though that it would take, even for something the size of my tiny little stone… it was probably more that I would produce over my <em> lifetime.</em></p><p>"The mined this crystal and used it in various ways, including inserting it into people in order to give them powers comparable to a ninja. That's what the people we fought had," I clarified. "During the fight with Haido, the mine itself was damaged and the Gelel began to escape. It was… it was alive. It was like a spirit. A kami."</p><p>It felt odd to put a name to it, because it wasn't what I would really call a god. But it was similar to a Shinto spirit, the kind that was simply an essence of the world.</p><p>"I was… I had been stabbed at that point," I said, glossing over it. "And it used me as a conduit to escape the seal, healing me in the process. Which was a better option than the seal rupturing, exploding, and quite possibly wiping out the entire continent."</p><p>Kahiko had not-so-cheerfully informed us that this had been an option after the fact. I was rather glad I hadn't known ahead of time. His intended alternative of <em> summoning a black hole</em> wasn't too flash either, in my opinion. That had been what he'd been trying to accomplish with the 'blood of the royal family' maneuver, and while I could admire the sheer balls of it - and the reminder that seals were reality bending <em> dangerous</em> - I repeated my desire to not be caught in the middle of it.</p><p>A minute twitch of Tsunade's eyebrow was the only indication that she was bothered by what I'd just said.</p><p>"It must have left a piece behind and when I tried to use chakra, something else happened. That's why I collapsed in the office," I finished.</p><p>That wasn't the end of it, of course. She had far more questions than that. But she seemed to know the majority of it already, so she'd probably spoken to Naruto and Shikamaru. The extended information about the Gelel was really the only thing that I knew and they didn't. Apart from the book… and somehow I failed to bring that up. I should have, I knew that. I just didn't.</p><p><em> It's not really about the mission</em> , I rationalized. <em> And the fewer people that know about it the better.</em></p><p>Afterwards, I tentatively asked, "Tsunade-sama? About the Elders…" I wasn't entirely sure how I would have finished that sentence, but she seemed to get my meaning.</p><p>She smiled sharply. "Oh, I wouldn't worry about them. That won't be happening again." She looked satisfied. "You can thank your brother for making such a fuss at the gates about needing medical treatment. In light of that, their actions are highly negligent and I have more than enough justification to implement restrictions on their ability to interfere with my shinobi."</p><p>"Glad to be of service," I muttered, even as my insides squirmed. 'Justification' meant that people would back her on this issue. It meant that people would <em> know</em> . I would forever be 'that girl that died in the Hokage's office'.</p><p>How embarrassing.</p><p>"More than you know," she said cryptically, even though I was pretty sure I <em> did</em> know. "I'm slapping this mission with an S-rank Classified label. Where you went and who you met is public information, but anything with regards to this Gelel, the stones or mine is not."</p><p>"Why only that half?" I asked curiously.</p><p>Tsunade smirked. "I'm good, but even I can't hide the invasion of two countries. Besides, this could work in our favour. Coming to the aid of Hidden Sand like that shows we're taking this alliance seriously, even with how new it is. It will almost be worth dealing with those old fossils, knowing how much they're going to have to grovel for this."</p><p>"Taking it seriously? We have barely a year of experience between us," I said skeptically. "That's not exactly…"</p><p>She arched an eyebrow. "Our Jinchuriki. The Jounin Commander's two children. The fact that you succeeded <em> makes</em> it 'exactly'<em> .</em> "</p><p>It sounded so weird when she put it like that.</p><p>Like people would actually think that we'd been on a purposeful assignment, rather than randomly stumbling into trouble.</p><p>"You'll stay in the hospital until I'm satisfied your condition has stabilized," Tsunade said, business-like again. "There are a number of tests to run." She stood and walked towards the door. "Try not to get too excited."</p><p>Shikamaru ducked in through the door and under her arm the second she opened it, sliding around her with barely a nod. She seemed more amused than anything.</p><p>Shikamaru slid onto the bed next to me, sitting so we were thigh to thigh and tucking me in under his arm. I sighed and leant against him. It was a good thing we were both small, otherwise we might have been in danger of falling off the sides.</p><p>Sakura and Ino waited until Tsunade was gone before following him into the room, but Sakura ruined the sense of composure by immediately throwing herself at me and bursting into tears on my lap. I awkwardly patted her on the back and waited for the tears to subside. Ino perched on the other side of her and made an apologetic face.</p><p>"No Naruto?" I asked. I hadn't expected Kakashi-sensei to stick around, not really, but I had expected Naruto.</p><p>"He was pacing," Shikamaru muttered, in a tone that clearly added 'and he was annoying me'. "I sent him home to tell mum what happened."</p><p>I peered up at him. "That was dumb," I said. "What's mum going to think when she sees our squad leader come home without either of us?" I really hoped she didn't think to unpack our gear either, because I didn't want to see what she would make of my jacket.</p><p>There was a pause and an aggravated sigh. "Shit."</p><p>Sakura hiccupped and wiped her face. "Sorry," she whispered. "I was just so worried!"</p><p>"Sakura's the one who got Tsunade for you," Ino said, as explanation. I thought I remembered seeing Sakura behind Tsunade, right before I'd done an ungraceful face plant on the ground.</p><p>"I was at the market, and I heard the rumours from the gates," Sakura said with a sniffle. "So I came to the hospital to see you, but you weren't here. So I asked Tsunade-sama what was going on."</p><p>Sakura, I considered, didn't lack courage. At all. Because most people would take a few intermediate steps between 'can't find' and 'ask the Hokage'. It made me wonder what else had been going on, that that seemed like a logical progression of events. Maybe Tsunade had just been especially easy to locate.</p><p>"Thanks," I said. "I'm lucky you did."</p><p>She burst into tears all over again.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>I looked at Ino helplessly.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Eventually, the medic ninja came and kicked Shikamaru out so they could run some more tests and put me to bed. I was a little uncomfortable under their probing gazes, because they seemed utterly fascinated. That was probably a result of Tsunade's 'you died' story.</p><p>I got to be a medical marvel. Wonderful.</p><p>Once they were gone, I looked at the plastic jar still sitting innocently on my table. I reached out, fumbled the lid off, and tipped the stone into my hand.</p><p>There was no flash of chakra. There wasn't even any music. Nothing that said this was anything but a hunk of earth. It seemed utterly ordinary.</p><p>But I curled my fingers around it anyway. Maybe I could find a chain for it; wear it as a necklace.</p><p>I slept like the dead, though, a side effect of actual chakra exhaustion. When the medics came by in the morning for round two, I just rolled over and dozed. They could beep things at me all they liked, I didn't have to be awake for it.</p><p>People came by, but I have to admit, I mostly dozed through those visits too, feeling too drained to want to socialize. Mum was there, and I roused myself enough to mumble at her, even if it was most likely an incoherent jumble of syllables. That was pretty typical 'just woke up' behavior from our family, really.</p><p>Sakura came by with lunch, and I was awake enough at that point to want a change of scenery. It took a little convincing, but we moved out to the hospital courtyard and sprawled out on the grass under the shade of a tree.</p><p>We weren't the only ones out there, and I let the general chatter wash over me while we ate.</p><p>Two of them, either young medical ninja or trainees, by the looks of them, were having a very fugitive conversation, which involved plenty of glances in our direction. I considered them. On one hand, I had so little chakra recovered that it seemed like a huge waste to use it eavesdropping. On the other… I was really quite nosy. If they were talking about me, or my mission, then I'd really rather know. There were bound to be some rumours circulating by now.</p><p>I carefully channeled a dribble of chakra to my ears.</p><p>"-that's Shikako Nara!" the brunette hissed to her friend. "She's the one that Tsunade-sama brought in yesterday!"</p><p>"I thought she was dead," the other said, puzzled. "Critical chakra exhaustion, right?"</p><p>"Migaki-sensei said she was basically a corpse already - that even Tsunade-sama couldn't save her. But he said that last time as well. You remember that big mission where all the clan kids got hurt, a few weeks ago? I was on shift then, and she just walked right in. They didn't think she was seriously hurt until they went to take a reading and the chakra sensor started spitting out single digit readings."</p><p>I squirmed uncomfortably and dropped the jutsu. Well. That did answer my question about how likely people were to believe what had happened.</p><p>Did she have to sound so… awed about it, though?</p><p>"I can't believe you," Sakura hissed at me. "You aren't supposed to be using chakra!"</p><p>I gave a guilty start. I hadn't expected Sakura to notice. "I was just… curious," I said, lamely. "I wanted to know what they were saying."</p><p>Sakura glanced sideways at them, frowning a little, and I realized she'd been listening in too. "They shouldn't have said that," she said.</p><p>I shrugged, looking up at the sky. "It doesn't matter, really," I demurred. "It's even kind of funny, really. I mean, if you go with 'shikabane'" – which was a more formal way to say corpse than 'shitai' or 'nakigara' – "then you can even make a pun about our naming tradition."</p><p>"How can you say that?!" Sakura burst out, looking at me with something akin to horror. "It's not a joke!"</p><p>"Ah, no, sorry," I said hastily, pulling myself into a sitting position. Had I crossed a line there? It hadn't been <em> that</em> bad. As deflections went, it was a little tasteless, but in a gallows humour kind of way.</p><p>"Everyone was really worried about you!"</p><p>And… I felt a flash of temper rising up. <em> I</em> had been the one hurt. <em> I </em> was the one who had become a god and said 'no'. <em> I</em> had been the one who had walked home worrying that I wasn't going to be the same ever again. <em> I </em> was the one in hospital.</p><p><em> Why is your worry more important than </em> <em> <strong> that</strong> </em> ? I thought viciously. <em> Why do I have to reassure </em> <em> <strong> you?</strong> </em> It was an ugly thought, and an ugly emotion and I clamped down on it hard before it could escape.</p><p>I didn't really want to say that to Sakura. Except for the parts of me that did.</p><p>Of our group - heck, maybe of all our year – Sakura was the most emotionally honest. If she was upset, she cried, regardless of whether she was in public or not. If she was upset with something, she wanted to talk about it and have it known. It wasn't a bad thing. But it wasn't how <em> I</em> was.</p><p>I did not, actually, want to talk about it – even if I could thanks to everything being classified – and I didn't want to rehash how everyone else felt. I wanted to be left alone.</p><p>"Sorry," I repeated, shortly. I lay back down and threw my forearm over my eyes, blocking them from the sun. "Do you have class this afternoon?" I asked, changing the subject to something less volatile.</p><p>"Yeah," Sakura said, after a lengthy pause. "Anatomy."</p><p>I seized onto that as a reasonable way to redirect the conversation, and also with the vaguest sense of relief that she wouldn't be sticking around all day. That was a mean thought, too, but I couldn't help it.</p><p>She offered to help me back to my room before she had to go, but I said I'd much prefer to stay outside. It wasn't like the medic-nin couldn't find me if they wanted to.</p><p>I wasn't in much of a mood to be social after that, but I did make an effort when Sasuke showed up. He didn't seem inclined to talk about the mission, or the rumours, anyway, for which I was grateful. It would probably be brought up at some point, but I was glad for the brief reprieve.</p><p>"Hey," I rasped, squinting up at him.</p><p>"Hey," he returned, dropping down to sit beside me. He put his back to the tree trunk, which was about as defensible as you could get out here. "Cloud watching?"</p><p>I made a sound of agreement, even though the only thing I could see from here was leaves.</p><p>We sat in silence for a while. "So what kind of trouble have you been up to while we've been gone?" I asked, covering a yawn.</p><p>His eyes flickered towards me. "Nothing so exciting."</p><p>Huh. I hadn't actually thought there <em> had</em> been something. Guess the curse of Lucky Sevens didn't die just because we were separated.</p><p>"Well, you can't leave it there." I nudged him in the thigh. "Go on."</p><p>He tilted his head. "A lightning bolt struck the Hokage's Tower," he said, casually.</p><p>I squinted at him. Because we'd just been to the Hokage Tower, and it had been remarkably undamaged. Still, I didn't disbelieve him. There had to be more to the story. "Bet that must have pissed Tsunade-sama off."</p><p>He smirked. "A bit. It wasn't real, though. Just a Genjutsu even if it fooled everyone. I had to work with the Hyuuga, but we managed to break it."</p><p>There was only one person that was 'the Hyuuga' to Sasuke with that level of disgruntled hostility. His grudge with Neji seemed to be deeper than just a personality clash. It wasn't stereotypical clash of clans, either, because he got on reasonably well with Hinata.</p><p>"Must have been some genjutsu," I said. Area of effect were normally weaker than targeted, but if it had affected the whole village, and had taken two genjutsu piercing bloodlimits to disrupt… And someone with that kind of strength had got deep enough into Konoha to strike the Tower…</p><p>"It was," Sasuke said, with a slight frown. "Kiba helped us track the caster down, afterwards. It was a girl from the Kurama clan. She'd managed to link it to some kind of foci – a painting. I almost thought it was a seal at first."</p><p>The name made me blink a little – what were the odds? – but then hazy knowledge dredged itself up. "They have some kind of bloodlimit, don't they? Based around genjutsu?" And there was something more than that… about the paintings…</p><p>"Yeah. Turns out she used to be Kurenai's student, a few years ago. Then something happened and she's basically been locked up under watch ever since."</p><p>That was definitely ringing some bells. Kurenai's student. Genjutsu. Mostly I remembered Team 8 running around with Naruto. Was she the one with some kind of alter ego? How had that been sorted out?</p><p>I drummed my fingers on the ground. "Locked up? Why? And why did she attack the tower in the first place?"</p><p>He hesitated. "For revenge, she said. She seemed to think that the Hokage had her parents killed."</p><p>I stared up at him in horror, heart stuttering in a way that would have given the medics conniptions. "Don't say things like that <em> here</em> ," I hissed. "Don't you know how easy it is to be overheard?"</p><p>I'd already proven that, eavesdropping on those medics before. They were gone, but we weren't alone. And better shinobi than me wouldn't even need to be nearby to do it. They could listen from inside, or leave recorders or traps or-</p><p>I swept my chakra sense out, trying to tell if there was anything there. It didn't help much. There were people in the hospital and any one of them could have heard.</p><p>I went cold. If anyone heard <em> Sasuke,</em> of all people, talking about the village killing its own… And Danzo had just been poking his nose into <em> my</em> mission. Had he been paying attention to Sasuke's? How quickly would he draw the wrong conclusion? What would he do, if it seemed like Sasuke was on to him?</p><p>Sasuke's face slowly lost all colour.</p><p>I didn't feel much better.</p><p>"What happened to her? The Kurama girl?" I asked, mind whirring. It was risky to keep talking about it, but it was also risky to put off the damage control.</p><p>Sasuke blinked, looking shaken. "She… was taken back to her house. Tsunade said- Tsunade said she was sick." He gave me a look that could be described as vaguely pleading.</p><p>"And who heard her say that?"</p><p>Just Sasuke, Neji and Kiba, apparently. And the other two had dismissed it; hadn't believe it was possible. <em> Sasuke</em> had dismissed it; he'd only really been joking and trying to get a reaction out of me. Well he had one, I thought grimly, but not at all what he wanted.</p><p>"You haven't done anything… out of the ordinary after that?" I persisted. "You haven't seen anything? People following you?" Would he even notice? ROOT <em> had </em> to be good at stealth, just to exist in Konoha. And if Sasuke had his guard down, because he was at <em> home…</em></p><p>I blew out a deep breath.</p><p><em> I have no idea what to do,</em> I thought miserably. If Danzo already knew, then he already knew. If he didn't know, then Sasuke really needed to stay away from anything that remotely linked him to it.</p><p><em> I wish dad was home.</em></p><p>Not only would dad know what to do, he'd probably have some idea if it was plausible or not. Whether or not he would tell me was another story, but it would at least mean someone was looking into it.</p><p>But he wasn't, and maybe wouldn't be for a while. There was no use wishing for things that couldn't be.</p><p>"Come visit when I'm out of hospital," I said. "We'll work it out. And until then,don't do anything different." Don't attract attention, I wanted to say. Don't let them think you know anything.</p><p>Sasuke gave a jerky nod.</p><p>I regarded him unhappily, aware that I had freaked him out, but it was necessary. He didn't know how close he had just stumbled to disaster.</p><p>"Help me back to my room," I said, because there was nothing else to say, and I needed to move. Outside wasn't comforting, anymore. It was too open, too exposed. Too dangerous.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Yakumo Arc: Chapter 73</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Okay, there has been some fantastic fanart for DOS drawn recently, so go check out the links in my profile page, if you're interested. <strong> Violet-skya </strong> has done a comic panel of chapter 70, which is awesome.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 73</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Fear cannot be banished, but it can be calm and without panic; it can be mitigated by reason and evaluation. ~ Vannevar Bush</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"I'm okay," I said, repeating the mantra that had been falling from my lips for days. The syllables were starting to become meaningless.</p><p>Shikamaru tapped a shogi piece into position. I made my move without giving it that much thought. It was a sloppy, haphazard play that I saw fault with almost immediately.</p><p><em> Too late, keep moving.</em></p><p>Shikamaru sighed, long and long, as if it came from his very bones. "No, you're not," he refuted. "You're not okay, 'Kako."</p><p>"I am," I countered. "I'm perfectly fine, see?" I lifted my arms in a little demonstration.</p><p>"That's not what I mean, and you know it," he said, but he seemed defeated, so I hoped he would give up this line or argument soon. I wasn't sure how much longer I'd be able to fight it without agreeing that he was right.</p><p>I really didn't want to do that.</p><p>We played silently for a while longer. The game was very lopsided, and I knew Shikamaru would wipe me off the board with no effort. It made me irritated, like an itch under the skin. I usually played better than this.</p><p>"You know," Shikamaru said, then stopped.</p><p>He clicked his piece into place, and I spent a few minutes studying it, half to avoid his eyes and half to try and salvage the game.</p><p>"You know that if you want to-" he started again. Stopped. He was looking at the board too. "You don't have to do field work. There's plenty of-"</p><p>My head jerked up. I glared at him. "I made a mistake, okay?" I said, and my voice wobbled a little bit. "I know I did. But that doesn't mean I… It doesn't mean I'm <em> bad </em> at this. I can do this. <em> Shikamaru.</em> "</p><p>"I didn't say you couldn't," he said. "I just… you got hurt. You got really, really hurt, Shikako." He ran a hand through his hair. "Do you know how lucky we were? You nearly didn't walk away from that. What if… next time you're not so lucky?"</p><p>My breath caught. "There won't be a next time," I said, as firmly as I could. I could hear the emptiness of the assertion, though. That wasn't something I could promise. "I won't make the same mistake again. I'll train harder. <em> It won't happen again.</em> "</p><p>"What if it does?" he persisted.</p><p>"It won't."</p><p>He looked frustrated.</p><p>I felt frustrated.</p><p>"I can't just quit," I said.</p><p>"Why <em> not?</em> "</p><p>I stared at him, feeling my throat constrict around the words, suffocating them. "Why don't you?" I choked out. "You could get hurt next mission. It's all the same."</p><p>How could I argue, when I couldn't explain <em> why</em> it was so important? When I couldn't share everything I knew? And the thing was, it wasn't about trust, not really. I'd known for years that I could tell them if I had to. I hadn't kept silent because I thought they would turn on me. I didn't think they would turn me in. If nothing else, I knew Shikamaru was on my side.</p><p>After Gelel, how could I not know that?</p><p>I kept silent, because to tell them the truth now, would be to tell them that I had <em> lied.</em> I had lied every day they had known me, every word and every action overshadowed by omission.</p><p>I wasn't the Shikako Nara they thought I was.</p><p>I didn't keep silent because I didn't trust them.</p><p>I kept silent because they would no longer trust me.</p><p>"It's not the same," Shikamaru muttered. "I don't get missions like you do."</p><p>Which… was true. But not really the issue. "You could," I said. "It only takes one."</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>I bit my lip and tried not to feel too hurt. I could see his point. I could. I knew what he was trying to do. That didn't mean it didn't hurt when it sounded like he didn't think I could make it as a ninja. That I wasn't good enough. That all I was going to do was get myself killed.</p><p>I clicked a piece into place on the shogi board, not caring if it was a good move or not. I didn't even care if it was a legal move. It was just something to do.</p><p>Our standoff was broken by a knock on the door.</p><p>"Am I interrupting?" Ino asked cautiously.</p><p>I forced a smile. "No, of course not. Come on in."</p><p>"Right," Ino agreed, awkwardly edging into the room. She passed me a leather necklace strap, just like I'd asked for. I twisted it around my fingers and didn't put the stone on it immediately, because I thought Shikamaru might recognize it, and after that conversation I just… didn't want to.</p><p>"Thanks," I murmured. "I owe you."</p><p>"No problem," Ino said, eyes flicking from one of us to the other. "Is everything okay?"</p><p>Shikamaru sighed and stood up. "Yeah, it's fine," he said dully. "I should probably go. Mum wants me to help sort out the fortnightly orders."</p><p>Given that dad wasn't here, and mum was handling a lot of the clan matters, it wasn't so strange that she wanted his help with it.</p><p>It still seemed like a retreat.</p><p>"Have fun," I said, idly, starting to pick up all the shogi pieces from our terrible game. I didn't look up as he left.</p><p>"Okay, that was not 'fine'," Ino said, sinking into the vacant chair. "That might be the very definition of 'not fine'."</p><p>"It's <em> fine</em> ," I stressed. "Just leave it alone, okay?"</p><p>She leveled a serious look at me. "I want to help you. I know you don't like it so much when you need help, not like this. Not when it's for real. But … I am here for you, okay?"</p><p>Ino was in the middle of her own identity crisis. Ino had been hurt in a way that even my near death experience didn't match. And she was still trying to help.</p><p>It wasn't fair to dump that on her. It wasn't fair in the way that Sakura expecting me to reassure her wasn't fair.</p><p>"I know that," I said quietly. "But… I'm okay, yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah," she agreed seriously. "You are."</p><p>I sagged. Until she said it, I hadn't realized how much I needed someone else to verbalize it. To agree with me.</p><p><em> Yes. You are okay. You will be okay.</em></p><p>Everyone was so insistent that I wasn't. They were tearing down the foundations that I was using to keep myself steady, the walls and defenses that I had built. And Ino… Ino had just pitched in to help fortify them.</p><p>I made a muffled sound, that might have been a sob, and covered my eyes.</p><p>Arms wrapped around me. My chin dug awkwardly into her shoulder. "You're okay," she whispered. "You're so strong, you know that? This isn't going to be what takes you down."</p><p>I focused on breathing, and let the words settle in.</p><p><em> Yes. You are okay. You will be okay.</em></p><p>Then I chuckled and drew back, a wry smile tugging at my lips. "Sneaky," I said.</p><p>She feigned innocence. "I'm here to help. That's all."</p><p>And that was a huge part of who Ino was. Someone who wanted to help. Who wanted people to be happy and healthy and confident in their own skin. Who liked fixing things.</p><p>"I had a fight with Sakura," I admitted, slightly abruptly. "Yesterday when she visited me."</p><p>It was a simple problem, something that would probably blow over by the next time Sakura and I saw each other if we ignored it. But it was also something that would be so, so easy for Ino to fix.</p><p>"What about?" she asked, because Sakura and I didn't really argue. We didn't always get on, but I didn't like arguing and Sakura hadn't always been so assertive.</p><p>"I made a joke," I said, shrugging a little, and looking up at the ceiling. "Okay, it was a bad joke but still." I told her about it.</p><p>"Shikabane," Ino said, shaking her head. But she snickered. She understood, at least, why I'd said it. "That is bad. Please tell me no one in your family was that bad at names."</p><p>I considered. "Well there was Shikatsu. Which could mean 'Life or Death'. But she picked that one out herself, I think. Her birth name was Amago." She hadn't been the heir, but it had been … not uncommon for heirs to die. Whoever took over as clan head usually picked a traditional 'shika' name to go with the role even if they hadn't been born with one. Dad had kinda bent the rules with giving both Shikamaru and I the same name, even if I suspected he just didn't want to come up with another one.</p><p>Ino snorted. "Trout. Like that's much better."</p><p>"Like you have room to talk, <em> Ino.</em> "</p><p>She shoved me in the shoulder. We grinned at each other.</p><p>It occurred to me, that just as I knew what she had done, she knew exactly what I had done in telling her about that fight. Was this what ninja friendships were like? Knowing what each other needed, and giving just that and no more? And each of you knowing, all the while? It seemed manipulative, almost. And yet… was it really that different?</p><p>It was just … more deliberate than before. That was all.</p><p>"We should all get together again," I suggested. "Study group."</p><p>"Absolutely," Ino agreed easily. "I think we're all in the village at the moment, anyway. We should take advantage of it."</p><p>"As soon as I get out of here." I stretched. "Hopefully soon."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Tsunade did discharge me from hospital in the end, even if she seemed slightly concerned about the rate that my chakra was returning.</p><p>I didn't tell her I had used some of it. That would have got me far worse than 'slight concern'.</p><p>It was good to get home, even if the first thing I did was clean out my mission bag. I was so glad that ninja became so paranoid about packing their own mission gear. No one had touched mine. It was all really gross by now, and everything would need cleaning, but no one had touched it.</p><p>The book was safe. No one had seen the bloody remains of my clothes. Because there was a difference between hearing that I'd been hurt while seeing me perfectly fine in the hospital, and seeing the physical evidence of just how bad it had actually been. I didn't want mum to have to come face to face with that.</p><p>I shoved the book into a sealing scroll, feeling the bite of chakra as it activated much more than I usually would, and hid it amidst my other scrolls. It wouldn't do as a permanent hiding place, but for now…</p><p>Then I emptied out the pockets of my bloodstained jacketed, rolled it up and binned it. I wasn't keeping it. Everything was thoroughly unpacked, cleaned, replaced and repacked. Tsunade had said two weeks, but I felt much better having my stuff ready <em> now.</em></p><p>The fact that it hadn't been ready had been a minor but persistent nagging in the back of my brain the entire time I was at the hospital.</p><p>Then I cast a critical eye around my bedroom and decided it needed tidying too.</p><p>There was a shine of productivity that came from making progress, even if it wasn't on the things that you <em> should </em> have been doing.</p><p>"Cleaning?" Shikamaru asked quizzically, leaning on the doorframe to my room, hands tucked casually in his pockets.</p><p>I shrugged, and ran a hand through my hair. It was sweaty. Yuck. "Seemed messy," I said.</p><p>He shrugged, because it wasn't like mess bothered him. It usually didn't bother me either. "Mum's making gyoza for dinner."</p><p>I liked gyoza, don't get me wrong. They were lovely little steam fried dumpling things, and I would happily eat them all. But they were a ridiculous amount of effort to make, and I could never see the point of putting that much work into something you were only going to eat.</p><p>No, that wasn't an opinion I would ever voice in the hearing of an Akimichi. I wasn't an idiot.</p><p>"I guess that was a hint to come downstairs and help out?" I asked, standing. I sighed. I didn't really feel like either cooking or socializing but giving in the first time mum asked would probably give me some leeway down the road. If she really wanted us downstairs, it would escalate from 'hint' to 'order' to 'nagging' and I didn't want to deal with that either.</p><p>In the kitchen, mum had already made the dough and filling, so all that was really left was putting it all together. The three of us sat around the table in comfortable familiarity.</p><p>I scooped a ball of filling mince out of the bowl, pressed it into the center of the dough wrapping and pinched the edges shut. My hand twinged, still stiff and awkward. Even though the Gelel had healed it, it would likely never be as good as new. The initial damage, that Kimimaro had caused, had been nearly healed before I'd gone out on the mission. It was better than anyone expected it would be, and with training I could probably get it to a level where no one would never notice it had been hurt, but it would never reach the level of speed and flexibility that it <em> could have </em> if it had never been damaged in the first place.</p><p><em> Think of it as PT</em> ,I thought, carefully pinching the edges of another dumpling shut. <em> Productive PT even. Much better than 'move your finger twenty times'.</em></p><p>It wasn't silent – we did talk. It was just nothing that struck me as important. 'You should be more sociable', 'don't just shut yourself away in your room', 'have you cleaned up' all made an appearance.</p><p>"I'm plenty sociable," I protested lightly, mostly focused on my hands. "I might go visit Hinata tomorrow, or Kiba. He promised to show me the new puppies." Not recently, mind you, but if there was an excuse I would take it. I wasn't quite sure how I'd manage to get from 'invite Hinata to study group' to 'ask Neji about the Kurama girl <em> without</em> making him suspicious' either. It wasn't like Neji and I were friends.</p><p>"You can take the fortnightly delivery to the Inuzuka clinic then," Mum said. "If you're going that way."</p><p><em> Even better</em> .</p><p>I made a grumbling sound, just so she didn't get suspicious. Somehow, she always seemed to be when we agreed to do things without complaining.</p><p>"So Sasuke said there was some excitement while we were gone?" I asked vaguely at a later point. Surely a lightning strike to the tower wouldn't have gone unnoticed.</p><p>Mum hummed. "Yes, there was an emergency drill. I suppose with all the things that have been happening lately, Hokage-sama has been refining the response system. And, well." She looked at us both and sighed. "The situation with Hidden Cloud… it could escalate at any time."</p><p>"What happened?" Shikamaru frowned.</p><p>"The Kurama clan provided a genjutsu," Mum elaborated. "Lightning striking the Hokage Tower, in order to simulate an attack by Hidden Cloud shinobi. It was only a short response drill, two or three hours at the most, but it does show she is taking things very seriously, doesn't it?" She frowned, looking worried.</p><p><em> Oh. Wow.</em> Because that was all kinds of brilliant, wasn't it? Disguising an actual attack as a drill, using the actual enemy outside our boarders as an explanation… and yes I could see why 'lightning strike' and 'Cloud Ninja' went together without elaboration. The fact that that kind of attack was a legitimate worry and people were wondering if we were going to be stepping up onto war footing... Tsunade wouldn't want to compound matters by revealing that our own shinobi were turning on us.</p><p>"The Kurama," I repeated, with a frown. "Wasn't there a thing about them, a few years ago?" That was a risk. I had no idea what happened.</p><p>"A few… oh, yes. The Clan Head and his wife were killed in a house fire," Mum said, trying to recall. "It was suspicious, but it was just after the Uchiha… well. There wasn't anyone to look into it. Their daughter survived it, though. She must have been around the same age as you two, come to think of it. Was she at the Academy with you?"</p><p>I frowned. "I can't remember," I said. Not in our class, I didn't think. I would have recognized the surname.</p><p>Shikamaru shrugged when I looked at him. No, he wouldn't have really noticed either.</p><p>That was good information, though. Something concrete to look into.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning, I went round to the Hyuuga compound. I didn't quite make it all the way there before I almost literally ran into Naruto.</p><p>It was, frankly, one of the last places I expected to see him.</p><p>I blinked. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>He rubbed at the back of his head and chuckled awkwardly. "Eh, I had to come and get Neji," he explained. "I have a mission with his team."</p><p>"Already?" I asked, a little surprised. Then again, Naruto hadn't been hurt and he couldn't exactly do much training in the village when Kakashi-sensei had been sent out again almost as soon as he'd returned.</p><p>"When I sent out all those clones to look for stuff in Land of River, they found some guys who wanted to come to Konoha." Naruto shrugged. "I helped them a bit, and they must have got here okay because when I asked Baa-chan about it, she said it could be my problem."</p><p>Well, it was good that Naruto was taking responsibility for things, and following up on what happened. I guessed that Tsunade was trying to encourage that. And it would probably be good for Naruto to 'lead' a mission where he actually was the person in charge, rather than the way he would defer to me or Shikamaru. Not that I suspected Neji would let him get away with terrible decisions but it would be different.</p><p>It did put a bit of a hole in some of my plans though.</p><p>"That's great," I said, distractedly. "Uh. Do you think… could you do me a favour?"</p><p>"Of course!" Naruto said, brightly, as if he'd love nothing more.</p><p>I felt a little bad about asking. It wasn't that I thought he would say no. It was that I was pretty sure he would say yes. "I'm a little low on chakra," I said. "Do you think I could…"</p><p>Naruto lifted his hands up, glowing blue. "Of course! That's easy. I have heaps of chakra!" He giggled. "I thought you were going to ask something difficult."</p><p>I didn't have enough chakra to properly do a Transfusion. It wasn't really the kind of jutsu you were supposed to use on yourself, either. In the end, I only really managed to smooth out some of the peaks before shunting it into my coils. It felt awful. It <em> burnt</em> .</p><p>"Thanks," I said, managing an actual smile despite all that. "Good luck with your mission. Stay out of trouble."</p><p>Naruto grinned and bounced off.</p><p>I rubbed tiredly at my eyes, and went and talked to Hinata anyway. Maybe it was for the best that Neji wasn't there. He was clever enough to put it together that something was up if I asked about it directly, and good enough at reading people that he'd notice if I tried to ask about it indirectly.</p><p>Maybe Kiba would be the better choice after all.</p><p>I headed back onto the clan grounds and swung by the main pharmaceutical office to pick up the Inuzuka Clinic delivery and requisite paperwork. It wasn't unusual for me to do that, so no one really raised any eyebrows, though I did have to repeat 'I'm fine, I'm fine' a few times.</p><p>Hana was in the office when I got there, so it was a simple matter of running through the checklist, checking the bottles and signing off that everything had arrived safely. I liked Hana, she was brisk and no nonsense, but never really rough or curt. Also, you had to respect anyone who maintained both an active field presence and effectively adapted Konoha medical training for animals.</p><p>"Great," I said, folding up the signed papers and tucking them into my pocket when we were done. "Is Kiba around?"</p><p>Hana filed her copy away into a black folder. "In the kennels," she affirmed, pushing the back door to the office open and bellowing his name down the corridor.</p><p>I smothered a grin.</p><p>"What?" Kiba hollered back, vaguely annoyed, before his head poked into the office. He blinked at me. "Oh. Hey. What's up?"</p><p>I shrugged. "Just dropping off the clinic's medicine. How're you holding up?" He'd been injured worse than I had on the Sound Four mission, but we hadn't really had a chance to catch up since.</p><p>"Eh, I'm back on light duty." Kiba shrugged and held the door open, a clear invitation to follow. "I heard you got yourself messed up again."</p><p>"Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated," I said, because when did you ever get the chance to quote that and mean it?</p><p>Kiba laughed. "Well yeah, they must have been." We twisted through a few corridors, though a room with small dog cages and outside where the large runs were. Most of the Inuzuka dogs roamed free, but about half of the cages were full with dogs that were injured, or had puppies, or otherwise needed to be separated from the rest.</p><p>There was a press of small fury bodies to the outer fence as they all rushed over to investigate the 'new' person. I crouched down and wiggled my fingers at them. "So cute."</p><p>"They all need names," Kiba said idly. "You got any good ones?"</p><p>"Sorry," I said. "Nara are good at a lot of things, but names aren't one of them. We're twins named 'deer girl' and 'deer boy' and the only reason we have the 'deer' is because of tradition."</p><p>"Better than getting called 'nose'," he shrugged philosophically.</p><p>"Is it really that Kanji?" I asked. "I thought it would be 'flower'?"</p><p>"That's what Hana wants people to think," Kiba said. "But it's not. Mom was on the good drugs and dad was too scared to argue. At least they picked mine in advance."</p><p>I snickered. We bantered a bit more. I learnt that Shino was apparently back in the village, and annoyed that he'd been the sole member of the Konoha 12 to <em> not</em> go on the Sound Four mission.</p><p>"Seriously," Kiba said. "Don't bring it up unless you want a half an hour rant about it."</p><p>"Would telling him that he was one of the first people we asked for help?" I asked. "If he'd been in the village, he would have been there." Because I could sympathize with feeling left out. It wasn't like we'd done it on purpose, but it was a big event that everyone but him had been involved in.</p><p>"Oh, I know," Kiba responded. "I told him it was his own fault for being so smug about going with his dad. If he'd just been doing nothing like the rest of us…" He grinned at me.</p><p>"The price of ambition," I quipped lightly.</p><p>Kiba opened the gate, and a whole litter of puppies came tumbling out over me. "So this is what you've been doing? Looking after puppies?"</p><p>"Mostly," Kiba agreed. "And training."</p><p>"Sasuke said you helped him with the genjutsu thing the other day," I said, hoping that was opening enough to get him to talk. I didn't want to ask too many pointed questions. I wasn't sure if Kiba would know anything that Sasuke didn't, and I didn't want a repeat of how <em> that</em> conversation had gone. Kiba would be much safer if he didn't suspect anything was amiss.</p><p>"He told you that? Well yeah. When the lightning bolt hit, I sniffed the caster out; used the scent of the jutsu to track back to where she was hiding. Should have figured it was a genjutsu at that point, but I didn't."</p><p>That was pretty impressive actually, in terms of tracking. I wasn't an expert, but jutsu didn't exactly leave much in the way of a ninja's scent. Maybe a small amount of chakra residue…</p><p>"Then she got us all in another genjutsu, like the entire village was empty and destroyed." He frowned. "It was weird. Even Kurenai-sensei's genjutsu aren't like that."</p><p>"Like what?" I asked.</p><p>"Even though we knew it was a genjutsu we couldn't break it. None of the normal methods worked." He showed me a bite mark on his hand, and since Akamaru wouldn't do that, I guessed it had to be part of their attempts to break the illusion. "Even Neji's Byakugan couldn't see through it. Sasuke even put a genjutsu on us, <em> inside</em> the genjutsu. I dunno, I think he hypnotized her into undoing it, in the end." He shrugged. "But the medics took her away after that. They said she was sick. And the Hokage said we'd call the whole thing a drill."</p><p>He cast a sheepish look at me.</p><p>I put on a reassuring smile. "It's okay, I already knew," I said. "She was about our age though, right? Yakumo Kurama?" I'd looked up the old newspapers in the clan archive, dredged up the articles about the house fire that mum had mentioned. There hadn't been a lot. There never really was, in the newspaper, and I wasn't exactly sure it was trustworthy anyway. But it had given me a name. "Did she go to school with us?"</p><p>"Nah," Kiba said with complete confidence. "I've never met her before." He tapped his nose. "She never went to the Academy at all."</p><p>Setting aside the implication that he would recognize and remember all those scents – which I wasn't sure I could even do with <em> faces</em> – that meshed with what I had thought. She might have just been old enough that we'd never crossed paths, or she might have not gone to the Academy the same way I narrowly missed out. It wasn't common, in clans, but it could happen.</p><p>"Did she seem sick?" I asked, mind ticking over. Sasuke had mentioned that too, that she had been called 'sick'. Was it a euphemism?</p><p>Kiba actually tilted his head in thought. "You know, I didn't notice," he said. "She didn't smell sick-sick. Not, like, hospital-sick." He shrugged. "But there's a lot of stuff that I wouldn't have picked up on. I'm not Hana. You gotta have training to notice that kind of stuff."</p><p>"Of course," I agreed automatically. Some of these were details I probably should have gotten from Sasuke in the first place. But some of them were things he wouldn't have known either. This had been a worthwhile venture.</p><p>There wasn't much else he could tell me. I let the conversation fade away from that topic, falling to other things, and maybe staying to play with the puppies for longer than was <em> strictly</em> necessary to maintain cover.</p><p>I swung by Sasuke's apartment, but he wasn't there. He wasn't at the team training grounds either, or the Uchiha training grounds, and that exhausted my list of places to look for him.</p><p><em> Damn.</em></p><p>I blew out a breath and leant against a tree, staring at the sky and hoping it would provide inspiration. The explanation that Yakumo was 'sick' had potential, but it was a dead end in terms of information. I couldn't access medical records – they were highly secure. It might not have been 'doctor-patient confidentiality' but Tsunade believed in keeping records of what were effectively <em> weaknesses</em> secret. That kind of stuff could literally be a killer if it got out.</p><p>Anbu was even more of a laugh, if they were involved. I'd get nothing there.</p><p>Short of out and out going to the Kurama clan compound… and we didn't really have any contact with them. I had no <em> reason</em> to. It would raise too many alarms if anyone was watching.</p><p>And Sasuke said she had been locked up <em> before</em> this attack, so it was doubtful I'd be able to get to her now.</p><p>I chewed the thought over as I wandered home, hoping something would jump out at me. There were <em> ideas</em> , but nothing I was willing to run with at this stage.</p><p>When I got home, Shikamaru was seated in the lounge, playing shogi against himself. There was a thick file sitting next to him, and he held it out to me without looking up from the game.</p><p>"Kofuku-oba dropped this off for you," he said, naming the aunt that was in charge of approving the clan research projects. I knew her reasonably well, but I couldn't think of any reason off hand why she would be looking for me <em> now.</em> "She said to come discuss it with her later."</p><p>"Okay," I agreed, uncertainly, taking it and flipping it open. The first page was familiar though. I'd forgotten about this. I'd lodged an application to have access to a variety of stone and rock types, and possibly crystals to see if there was variation in the amount of chakra that they would be able to store. It had been one of the first steps to my attempts to create a chakra storage seal.</p><p>I'd forgotten about it, because it had been lodged before I'd graduated, and I suspected it was full of faulty fuuinjutsu assumptions.</p><p>"It was approved?" I asked surprised, and received no answer.</p><p>It wasn't that I was asking for materials that were rare or difficult to get a hold of. It was just… even I didn't stand by my original application. There was no way Kofuku-oba thought it was a good research plan. Unless she meant for me to learn that, but … well. There were easier ways to convey that.</p><p>I'd have to go see her to find out.</p><p>I sighed, deeply. Infusion of chakra or not, I felt <em> tired.</em> All these mysteries didn't help.</p><p>"I'm going to go lie down," I said. "Read a book or something."</p><p>Except that reminded me that I really did have a book to read. I tromped up the stairs, mind whirling into a different problem and the solutions I'd picked out.</p><p>Now that I had chakra to use, I knew what I could do with the Book of Gelel. It was a little risky, but infinitely safer than leaving it lying around in my room, even sealed into a scroll.</p><p>I'd seal it into me.</p><p>Storage seals could be put onto anything – there wasn't anything wrong with that. They just weren't usually practical to put on <em> people</em> , unless you were desperately in need of a spare kunai. And most ninja wouldn't have known enough about sealing to do it themselves, and wouldn't have trusted a Seal Master to put a seal on them either.</p><p>None of those were really a problem for me. I could do it myself – had put seals on myself already – and I only wanted to store one thing.</p><p>I got out my ink and brush and stared at myself in the mirror, trying to decide where it was going to go. Somewhere that it wouldn't be immediately noticeable, so arms were out, and my training seal already took up a chunk of space around my wrists. Back would be too difficult to reach, and I probably wanted to be able to get the damn thing out to read. Eventually I settled on the curve of my hip bone, where it would be hidden regardless of whether I wore pants or swimsuits.</p><p>It required a bit of awkward twisting to paint the seals along my leg and stomach. I had to lie flat on the ground, and one part trailed off me and onto a scroll laying on the floor. I tried not to move much as I put the brush down and unsealed the book from its previous home.</p><p>I took a deep breath, balancing it carefully on the point of my hip. "Seal."</p><p>Chakra flexed. Smoke puffed out. The ink coiled and retracted, chasing its way over my skin to the center point. I could <em> feel</em> it twisting, could feel the new pocket dimension forming, could feel the seal setting on my skin. I breathed deep, rode it out, and <em> pressed</em> , forcing the seal smaller and smaller, compressing it to a point.</p><p>It was… interesting. I didn't usually compress seals. None that I used were big enough to bother with going the extra step.</p><p>I sat up. Moved my hand so I could see it. Heavy gothic lettering, English letters, slightly smaller than the palm of my hand. Not bad.</p><p>Granted, I could have chosen a better compressed form than the word 'book' but it was descriptive. It worked. It conveyed the essence of what I wanted it for.</p><p>I pressed chakra into the seal, releasing the book. It appeared with no problem, and the outline of the seal was still visible on my hip. Good. It was no good if the seal would only work once. It was too messy to have to redo it each time. But there was no reason it <em> shouldn't </em> have. Normal storage seals worked more than once.</p><p>The whole process hadn't taken all the much chakra, but it was have been more than I would have been able to spare if I hadn't run into Naruto. As it was, I was probably going to have to use some up before I went to my next hospital check-in, otherwise there would be questions asked.</p><p>I fixed my clothes, put away my ink and brush, and sat down to read.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Later that afternoon, head buzzing with a long dead civilization and chakra matrix theories that I only half understood, I headed down to the research labs to find Kofuku Nara.</p><p>She had a tidy little office, a desk and a few chairs, filled with books and folders. Most of them were unnamed.</p><p>"Ah, Shikako-chan," she said, looking up from reading a scroll. Even as I hesitated in the doorway, she smoothly rolled it up and tucked it into a holding stand. "I didn't expect to see you so soon."</p><p>"Oba-san." I bobbed a quick bow. "You, uh, you approved my research application?"</p><p>"Preliminarily," she agreed, ushering me in and shutting the office door. "We do have a fair basis of information on some of the points you mentioned – certainly the geological ones. I don't expect that you have access to them at the moment, but I can get you dispensation for certain articles and papers."</p><p>I'd expected that. I only had access to the Genin level archives, so anything in the upper level archives was beyond my reach. Soil types, rock types; those things were useful, for farming, for building foundations… all sorts of things. And not, in terms of difficulty, all that hard to study.</p><p>"I would be grateful," I murmured politely.</p><p>"Once the necessary background has been established," Kofuku-oba continued. "You can re-submit an edited proposal and I'll reconsider it. I've heard good things about your sealing aptitude so far, and this is certainly a direction that we would encourage you to explore. A functioning, independent chakra storage unit is certainly an ambitious goal."</p><p>I gave my thanks and tried not to frown. Because while I'd redesigned a few seals and could make copies of a dozen more… that wasn't exactly in the same league as creating them. Nowhere near. My 'best' seal was a touch based explosive, which was a fancy alternative to something you could purchase in any licensed weapons store in Konoha.</p><p>It was a bit of a stretch to expect me to jump from that to chakra storage.</p><p>Admittedly, the Book of Gelel would probably help extraordinarily in that situation. But it wasn't like anyone knew I had that.</p><p>We hammered out a few details, and she escorted me to the research specific archive to introduce me to Takatori. He was a distant cousin who was in charge of the archive and researching … something.</p><p>"You won't be able to remove anything from this room," Kofuku-oba said. "But you'll be able to come here as long as Takatori is present to supervise you."</p><p>Takatori yawned, rubbing at his eyes. "That's not something you should worry about. I'm starting to think I live here."</p><p>"He has authorization to acquire additional material if he thinks it's relevant," my aunt added. "I think you'll find plenty on the premises to occupy you, however."</p><p>Judging by what I could see, I agreed with her. These weren't <em> books,</em> they were hand written, or printed off type writers, an accumulation of individual research efforts. There were shelves and shelves of them, densely packed, the bookshelves barely far enough apart for a person to stand between.</p><p>My fingers itched. I wanted to touch them.</p><p>Takatori was grinning at me, like he could see the thoughts written all over my face. "We'll get along just fine, oba-san,"he said to her. "Where do you want to start?"</p><p>I stepped forward. "Where <em> can</em> I start?"</p><p>I didn't end up staying as long as I might have, however good company Takatori was. I was <em> tired</em> , and I'd already put in a few hours of 'study' today. And in terms of 'things important enough to force myself to do' this didn't reach the top of the list.</p><p>"You talked to Kofuku-oba?" Shikamaru asked, when I got home. He was still sitting in front of the shogi board, and I wondered if he'd played the whole afternoon, or if he'd gone and come back.</p><p>I nodded absently. "Yeah. I might be spending more time in the archives for a while."</p><p>"Too bad."</p><p>I paused, only halfway past him, and looked down at the game. It was a stalemate. "Shikamaru."</p><p>He looked up, quizzically. "Yeah?"</p><p>"How'd you get her to approve it?"</p><p>There was a flash of something in his eyes. "Why would you think I-"</p><p>"<em> Don't</em> ," I warned him. <em> Don't lie. Don't pretend you didn't.</em></p><p>Because it was a good move, wasn't it? If he couldn't convince me to quit the way he wanted to, then he could certainly distract me by giving me something I <em> wanted.</em> It might have even worked.</p><p>He shrugged. "I didn't tell her anything that wasn't true."</p><p>I waited. The silence stretched out.</p><p>"She was interested to know that you were being taught by Jiraiya," Shikamaru added, as explanation when it became clear that I wasn't going to move. There might have been more to it that that – there usually were more layers than there seemed to be – but it answered my question.</p><p>Shikamaru wanted me out of the field. And he was willing to work around me to get it to happen.</p><p>And the thing was…</p><p>It might have worked.</p><p>I wanted to do this.</p><p>But I <em> needed</em> to be stronger.</p><p>And …</p><p>It hurt that he'd done this. That he was trying to undermine me. That he was suddenly someone I needed to out think. That I couldn't trust him to be behind me one hundred percent, because his idea of what was best was different from mine.</p><p>I swallowed, rough and harsh. My throat was dry. I couldn't speak.</p><p>I brushed past him, up the stairs and into my room. The door shut with a click of finality.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"I, uh, I looked for you yesterday," I said awkwardly. "But you weren't home."</p><p>Sasuke shrugged, eyes flickering over the trees around us. We'd just gone for a 'random' walk in the clan forest, which was one of the safest places I could think of. "Patrol," he said, by way of explanation. It was even less verbose than was normal for him, and, yeah, that wasn't a good sign.</p><p>I nodded, sitting down against the base of a tree trunk and stretched my legs out in front of me. "I looked into it," I offered, because it was hanging in the air between us, unsaid. "Her name is Yakumo Kurama. She's fifteen and the heir to the clan. Her parents both died four years ago in a house fire. She's not officially registered as a ninja, and she never attended the Academy, so if she was Kurenai's student then it was a special arrangement. Unfortunately, Kurenai-sensei is still at the border, so it's impossible to ask her what happened."</p><p>Hesitantly, Sasuke came to crouch in front of me. "You think it's possible," he said, as if half disbelieving. "You think that she was telling the truth."</p><p>I hesitated. "I think … it's not <em> im</em> possible." This was a shaky line to tread. Because how much of his faith in the village did I shake? Too much, and Orochimaru's offer might seem attractive. Too little, and his own history would take him off guard.</p><p>"I thought you trusted Tsunade." That sounded almost accusatory.</p><p>"Four years ago wouldn't have been Tsunade," I reminded him. "And there are more people in power in Konoha than just the Hokage, no matter what it seems like. Something like this… we might not ever know the truth, Sasuke. That doesn't mean it's still not dangerous, either way. If it's true – <em> if</em> – then it's supposed to stay secret."</p><p>"But you're looking," he said flatly. "You think it's dangerous… you <em> panicked.</em> But you're still looking."</p><p>"I did," I admitted. "Sorry. You really surprised me with that one." I ran a hand through my hair. "But I'm looking because… even if it happened, that doesn't mean it was right."</p><p>"Right," Sasuke agreed with a prolonged exhale. "What do you need me to do?"</p><p>I considered it. "I don't know," I admitted. Because Sasuke getting involved would be dangerous for him because of his own history. And yet, I couldn't exactly push him out of it, for much the same reason.</p><p>"No plans?" he asked, but there was a faint hint of teasing.</p><p>"We'll have to wing it," I said gravely. "Though, if there are people keeping watch on her, they'll probably keep tabs on the people that came into contact with her. You probably don't want to look like you're looking…"</p><p>"I haven't seen anyone," Sasuke said, uneasily.</p><p>I nodded. "Just… keep your eyes open, okay?" I said. "That's all we can do."</p><p>Sasuke still looked troubled, which was fair. This hadn't been a very reassuring conversation.</p><p>I felt bad that I had no answers to give him. If I hadn't made a big deal out of it at the hospital, then he would never have considered anything to be wrong.</p><p>I didn't like this either. I'd gotten used to having, if not complete knowledge, then at least a decent idea what was going on. It seemed like everything this week was proving me wrong.</p><p>I felt very small.</p><p>"Want to do some training?" I asked half-heartedly, rolling my neck back to look up at the sky.</p><p>Sasuke snorted. "Aren't you supposed to be on medical leave?"</p><p>I shrugged. "What they don't know won't hurt them, right?"</p><p>He seemed to be considering it. "No." He shook his head. "I have afternoon patrol. I need to go soon."</p><p><em> Disappointing</em> . I sighed. "Too bad." It wasn't exactly that I felt up to training, but it would have been normal. We could use some normal.</p><p>And I needed to burn off some chakra before my check-up at the hospital.</p><p>Well. If Sasuke wasn't going to train with me, I knew how I could do that.</p><p>I stayed in the forest after he left, not bothering to seek out a proper training field. I wasn't going to be doing anything that damaging, and I didn't want anyone stumbling over me.</p><p>Instead, I leant back against the tree, and fished my new necklace out from underneath my shirt.</p><p>"You," I murmured, inspecting it.</p><p>It wasn't like the other stones of Gelel that I had seen. I couldn't hear it, couldn't feel it. But it couldn't be inert, either, because it <em> was</em> compressed chakra. It wasn't as physical or material as it seemed. So it couldn't be dead.</p><p>But maybe I couldn't feel it the same way that couldn't feel yourself.</p><p>Gently, gingerly, I touched a spark of chakra to it. It sank in with no sign that anything had happened. But I could still feel it. It was still <em> there.</em></p><p>Puzzled, I pulled it back out.</p><p>My hand came away from the stone, shadows creeping over it as the chakra re-emerged.</p><p>The transformation.</p><p>"Ah," I said.</p><p>I didn't panic. Not this time. It didn't get very far, barely covered my index finger and knuckle. There wasn't that much chakra.</p><p>I examined my finger with almost detached curiosity.</p><p>The stone clearly altered my chakra. My chakra then altered me. It wasn't so different from the principles of our jutsu in the end. This level of change might have been found in the upper levels of our clan techniques, but I'd never seen anything like it in action.</p><p>Tsunade had said this had been in my eighth gate, beside the heart. That meant that when I had tried to use chakra, this transformation had taken place. Now that it was external, I had to put chakra in and withdraw it for the same effect to take place.</p><p>I pushed chakra back into the stone. The shadows slid off my finger like a glove, retreating and retracting.</p><p>I flexed my hand. Nothing felt different about it. I gathered more chakra, pushed it into the stone and <em> pulled. </em></p><p>My hand wavered, shadows creeping up to the bend of my elbow. The necklace was still suspended it in, shadows solid enough to hold things. I let it go, let it fall to the ground. My hand stayed transformed.</p><p><em> Doesn't need contact. Nice to know.</em></p><p>I concentrated, trying to manipulate the shape of it. I could stretch it, a little, could bend and twist it in ways that hands generally <em> didn't</em> . It was difficult, but I didn't know if that was an inherent difficulty, or simply because it was something new to me. I'd keep trying.</p><p>I played around with it. How quickly could it change? How much chakra for how much transformation? I didn't try and do a full transformation, not like the one that had happened on our journey back – for one, I didn't have enough chakra to waste, and… I wasn't quite ready to risk it.</p><p>It left me tired though. Not exhausted-exhausted, but enough to remind me that yeah, I was supposed to be on medical leave here.</p><p><em> Need to work on it more,</em> I thought, looping the necklace back around my neck and tucking it away. <em> It's promising.</em></p><p>More than promising, really. If I could get it up to the level of full body transformation that it had been… that was Jounin level skills right there. I didn't expect I'd manage it quickly, but surely in a year or two… if I could get it by then, it would be brilliant.</p><p>At least one good thing had come out of this whole mess.</p><p>I took myself home, walked past Shikamaru without speaking, and went to my room.</p><p>I had a lot of reading to do.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"That looks much better," Tsunade said in satisfaction, ticking something off on her clipboard.</p><p>I swung my feet back and forth, perched on the edge of the examination bed.</p><p>I hadn't really expected Tsunade to be the one here. It seemed a little menial for the Hokage herself to follow through on boring things like check-ups. The initial damage, sure, but I'd expected to be offloaded to a regular doctor by now.</p><p>Not that I was complaining. I just hadn't expected it.</p><p><em> I thought you trusted Tsunade,</em> Sasuke had said yesterday.</p><p>I did.</p><p>I answered her questions, omitting only the slight jiggering of chakra I had done to get back into 'acceptable parameters' and considered.</p><p>At the end of the examination, Tsunade set the clipboard down and looked at me with serious eyes.</p><p>"Alright," she said, making a 'come on' motion with her hand. "Out with it."</p><p>I blinked. "Tsunade-sama?"</p><p>"Whatever it is you want to say," she elaborated. "Out with it."</p><p>I considered. Well. It wasn't Tsunade that we had to hide from, was it? She might not know about Sasuke, but Yakumo would be on her radar, if only from the attack on the tower.</p><p>"Yakumo Kurama," I started.</p><p>Tsunade sighed. "Medical leave means resting, not poking your nose into other people's missions," she scolded. "I don't know why I expected anything else from you."</p><p>"I was just wondering, if she was here at the hospital? Sasuke mentioned that you said she was sick…"</p><p>I didn't really want to bring Sasuke into it, but Tsunade basically knew where I'd heard about it all from already. I hoped he didn't get into trouble for it.</p><p>She raised an elegant brow. "Why?"</p><p>"I just wanted to know if I could speak with her," I said in a rush. "Based on what Sasuke told me, the way that she anchors genjutsu to paintings seems to mimic the fundamentals of sealing. Jiraiya-sama has been a great help in developing my own studies, but I'm very interested in the applications of being able to tie a technique to a picture. Even if it turns out to be a facet of her blood limit, I believe that studying it will provide a-"</p><p>"Stop, stop," Tsunade said, interrupting my semi-plausible explanation of my interest.</p><p>I stopped, sheepishly aware that I had perhaps sounded a <em> little </em> rehearsed. Possibly like the opening statement of a thesis. It was overdone.</p><p>I tucked my hands under my thighs, hunching my shoulders in a little.</p><p>"Yakumo Kurama is," Tsunade said delicately, "not sick in a way that I can cure. However she is still quite disturbed and very dangerous."</p><p>Well that was ominous, wasn't it?</p><p>"Aren't we all dangerous?" I asked, then ducked my head when I realised how cheeky that sounded. Clearly Naruto was a terrible influence on me, if I was talking to the Hokage like that.</p><p>I did see her smile, though.</p><p>"The Third decreed that she was dangerous enough to require Anbu supervision and permanent home detention." Her voice sounded idle, and she tapped her nails against her clipboard rhythmically. "I don't think you're quite at that level."</p><p>"Why home detention?" I asked, because Tsunade was willing to talk. I didn't know quite why she was explaining rather than telling me to shut up, but I wasn't going to ignore the opportunity. It might have been a test, it might have been an offer – I didn't know. But I wasn't going to ignore it.</p><p>"He considered it a merciful alternative to a more permanent solution."</p><p><em> Okay. What? </em> I frowned. Was Tsunade admitting… no surely not. She would hardly be so blasé about an in-village assassination to <em> me.</em> But clearly <em> killing Yakumo</em> had been an option somewhere along the line. I felt like I was missing a huge piece of the puzzle.</p><p>"With all due respect," I said, hesitantly, not really confident in this conversation at all. "But solitary confinement isn't merciful." There was a reason it was used as a punishment. No, not just punishment, it could cross the line to torture.</p><p>"Oh, I agree," Tsunade said. She sounded satisfied, like I'd said something she was waiting for. I felt very off-balance. "What would you suggest instead?"</p><p>"I.. suggest?" I faltered. Yeah, no. I had no idea what was going on here anymore. "I suggest that…" That what? I'd thought this was about her parents, but it might not have been, after all. <em> Disturbed and</em> <em> dangerous</em> . Tsunade had said. <em> Not sick in a way I can cure.</em> What did that mean? What did that leave? "… that unless Yakumo is completely unable to function in a social setting, isolation will only exacerbate whatever issues she suffers? Rehabilitation should focus on the building of support structures and social contacts…?" I trailed off.</p><p>Of all the responses I'd expected to asking, this wasn't one of them. I didn't know how to answer, and it made me very, very nervous – a trait that every student was familiar with. I had not studied for this exam.</p><p>I didn't know how we'd gone from asking what had happened, to talking about rehabilitation.</p><p>"And more specifically?" Tsunade prodded.</p><p>There was an answer she was looking for. And I didn't know what it was.</p><p>I took a deep breath. What could I say when I didn't know anything about her, about her circumstances? She was our age. Mixed up in something serious. Dangerous. Sick. Alone. <em> Alone.</em> "Specifically," I said slowly. Well why not? I'd already told Tsunade I wanted to talk to her. "There is a kunoichi study group that I would like to invite her to."</p><p>Something that looked an awful lot like surprise flickered across Tsunade's face.</p><p>Okay, that didn't seem to be the answer that she was going for, after all. I bit my lip and stayed silent.</p><p>"An interesting proposal," Tsunade said, eventually, and then said nothing more about the topic at all. "Your examination is completed. Your follow up will be in a week. Make sure you make an appointment with reception."</p><p>I gave her an uncertain look, as she swept out of the room.</p><p>No. I had no idea what all that had been about.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Yakumo Arc: Chapter 74</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: I sort of feel that anyone who has stayed for seventy chapters but still feels like this fic is about the plot is missing something…</p><p>Also, new Sidestory up to go with it.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 74</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> A shadow leaned over me, whispering, in the darkness,</em></p><p><em> Thoughts without sound;</em></p><p><em> Sorrowful thoughts that filled me with helpless wonder</em></p><p><em> And held me bound.</em></p><p><em> ~ Alfred Noyes</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"I think it's time to break for lunch," Takatori said with a yawn, stretching his arms up over his head.</p><p>I looked up from the book I was reading, pen absently tapping against my lip. "Hmm?" I queried. I knew he'd said something, but the meaning had been lost by the time it had registered. My head was floating in a cloud of calculations, ideas spiraling through but conclusions just out of reach.</p><p>"Lunch," he repeated. "Food. Sustenance."</p><p>My eyes drifted from his face to the clock. The library was windowless, tucked securely away inside the building, and there was a sense of quiet timelessness to it that made it difficult to keep track of the hours.</p><p>"Crap," I said, once it sunk in. "I'm late."</p><p>I shuffled my papers into my bag and darted around, putting all the books back on the shelves where they belonged. Takatori watched me with half-lidded eyes and mild interest, as I slung my bag over my shoulder and skidded out the door with a wave.</p><p><em> I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date…</em></p><p>I legged it out of the compound and towards the park, keeping to ground level out of the last remaining dregs of respect for my medical leave status. By now, my chakra was almost fully recovered and I hadn't felt <em> injured</em> in the first place, so it seemed terribly pointless to avoid training.</p><p>Hinata, Sakura and Ino were already there, which was unsurprising given how late I was. Tenten was out on a mission with Naruto, which meant that despite best intentions, she still hadn't been invited to a study group.</p><p>Well. That was just how things worked out sometimes.</p><p>"Guess I'm not missing much, huh?" I asked, dropping down to sprawl beside Hinata. She was sitting all proper and daintily, but I'd been hunched over a desk all morning and I wanted to stretch.</p><p>"Sakura-san wanted to work on her taijutsu," she murmured to me.</p><p>The park wasn't <em> technically</em> a training field, so they probably shouldn't have, but there was no one else here and Ino and Sakura weren't doing more than slow and basic taijutsu. I eyed them critically. Maybe my standards were higher now, but I was sure Sakura had been <em> better</em> than that. Then again it had been months since graduation, and that was more than enough time to lose your edge, especially when it wasn't something you had ever really used in action.</p><p>"Probably a good idea," I said. "If she wants to be a field medic, anyway. There are pretty strict requirements."</p><p>I wondered if she'd done any work on the strength technique I'd shown her. It… hadn't actually been that long ago, really. It just felt it, what with everything that had happened. So, probably not.</p><p>I tried to see if there was anything different about the way Ino fought – maybe she was a little twistier, maybe her moves were a little more circular and serpentine than before – but if there was anything it was negligible. She traded blows with Sakura, a quick back and forth, and said something that made them both laugh.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>"You want to?" I asked Hinata, motioning at the field. There was plenty of space. I could use the practice too, even if Hinata would probably trounce me. "No chakra though."</p><p>I wasn't <em> that</em> eager to get crushed.</p><p>She looked a little surprised, but agreed.</p><p>I bounced to my feet and took a couple of paces away from our stuff on the ground before assuming a ready stance, fists closed and up. Not quite my usual style, but if we weren't going to use ninjutsu, then I didn't need to be able to quickly form handseals.</p><p>Hinata sunk into a Jyuuken stance, but there was no surge of chakra and no glow to her hands, which meant I didn't worry overly when she slid forward, hand curving towards my chest.</p><p>I dodged rather than blocked, light on my feet and twisting around the follow up moves like I would have if they really were Jyuuken.</p><p><em> Back, back, left!</em> I pivoted outside, as if to come around from behind, but she was ready for me, twisting neatly on the spot and lashing out with a kick that would have taken me out at the knees if I hadn't jumped.</p><p>I grinned, tipped backwards and handspringed off the ground, flipping for distance.</p><p>Hinata smiled back, a light, serene curve of her lips, before launching an absolutely <em> relentless</em> assault against me.</p><p>I twisted, turned, dodged and feinted, and resorted to blocking what I couldn't avoid. It wasn't totally one sided, and I gave some back when I had an opening, sending us dancing and whirling across the grass. Wind swept around us, making my hair dance in the breeze, but it was warm and the sun was shining.</p><p>I laughed, feeling light and free, and Hinata danced after me, happiness glimmering in her eyes.</p><p>And then she swept my feet out from under me with an absolutely <em> vicious</em> ankle hook, and sent me tumbling into the dirt.</p><p>"Mercy, mercy!" I gasped, still laughing. "I give."</p><p>She offered me a hand, two fingers extended, and I reached up with my own extended similarly to clasp it and complete the seal of reconciliation. More formal, maybe, than this little tussle warranted, but I wasn't going to refuse it.</p><p>Then she used it to haul me to my feet and startled a yelp out of me.</p><p>"Go Hinata!" Ino cheered.</p><p>"Weren't you fighting?" I demanded, amused. "Go on. Shoo."</p><p>She poked her tongue out at me. Looked like I wasn't the only one feeling a little silly. And what was wrong with that, really? We were home, safe and happy.</p><p>It was okay to be happy.</p><p>I hummed, twitching a bit to a remembered beat. A bubble of mischief welled within me.</p><p>Well. Why not?</p><p>"It's the eye of the tiger," I started singing, flicking a smirk towards Ino. "It's the thrill of the fight, rising up to the challenge of a rival…"</p><p>The thing was. I hoarded my memories, spending them like a miser with a handful of precious coins. Because once I shared them, I lost them. Ino and Sakura and Hinata would never know the real song, the singer or the music or the way that it was just one of those pieces that everyone knew. To them, it would only be a weird ditty that I had sung off key in a forgettable place on a forgettable day.</p><p>Even if I showed it to them, it wasn't the same.</p><p>Sakura looked a little gobsmacked, hands coming up to cover her mouth. I was definitely toeing the line of acceptable here. Ino had every right to take offence. If I'd judged it wrong, she could even be hurt.</p><p>But Ino threw her head back and laughed. "Rawr," she said, fingers curling into little claws and stalking towards me. "I'll show you tiger."</p><p>I laughed and ran backwards. "And the last known survivor stalks the prey in the night, and she's watching us all with the eye," I drew it out, "of the tiger…"</p><p>It wasn't the first time that I'd sung something from my past to them – it was rare but Ino and Sakura had probably heard more of it than anyone, even if they didn't know what they were hearing. But what would they think of that? That I liked singing and making up tunes? It was harmless.</p><p>I was aware of two chakra signatures moving towards us, but it was a public place and they were only at walking speed, so I mostly ignored them until they actually approached us.</p><p>"Can I help you, Mitarashi-san?" Hinata queried politely.</p><p>I did recognize her. Anko Mitarashi had been the proctor for the second stage of the Chunin Exam, and she wasn't exactly forgettable. The second person I didn't know, but she was slightly older than us with long brown hair swept neatly to the side, bangs braided over one shoulder but loose elsewhere. She was wearing a pink kimono over purple baggy pants and mesh undershirt, which was all well within the range of normal ninja outfit. Her chakra was strong, not impressively huge or anything, but enough to tell she was trained in using it.</p><p>"You can," Anko agreed. "Oi, Nara. Your invitation has been graciously accepted." She put her hand on the girls shoulder and edged her forward a fraction. "Yakumo Kurama."</p><p>I was a little more surprised that it was Anko escorting her, than by Yakumo's presence itself, truthfully. Then again, with consideration, it wasn't that surprising. Anko was an Intelligence Division Special Jounin, personally experienced in betrayal and traitors, and probably reasonably aware of the troubles of reintegrating into society after said events. She was probably an excellent person to look after Yakumo.</p><p>Yakumo bowed. "I am very pleased to meet you."</p><p>I bowed back after a moment of hesitation. "Likewise." There was an awkward pause, and I took over providing introductions for everyone. It was probably my responsibility, since I'd invited her. Anko hung back, not really taking part, but not venturing too far away either.</p><p>"Sasuke met her on his last mission," I explained, glossing over the details of it.</p><p>Sakura clapped her hands together. "Really? You have to tell us about it! What was it like? Was he cool?" Her starry eyed crush on Sasuke had never really gone away, and I didn't really expect it to. There was nothing really <em> wrong</em> with having a crush, even if it occasionally made things awkward. People were allowed to have feelings.</p><p>"Give her a minute, Sakura," Ino said with a laugh. But then she shot me a look that indicated I was going to have to do some explaining later.</p><p>I gave her a harried nod. Yes, okay, springing this on them wasn't exactly great either. But I hadn't exactly expected my invitation to be taken up? No, that was a shitty excuse.</p><p>"Yakumo specializes in genjutsu," I volunteered. "I know that that's not quite what we're working on, but I thought it would be interesting to have a different perspective on it." I turned more towards Yakumo to continue the explanation. "None of us have had much of a chance to study genjutsu since graduation. Well, apart from Hinata, since Kurenai-sensei specializes in genjutsu… I think you know her?"</p><p>Yakumo nodded, but something dark flickered across her face at the mention of Kurenai. "Yes," she said. "Kurenai-sensei tutored me several years ago."</p><p>Hinata smiled at her, clearly pleased with the connection. It probably said something about the strength of the student-teacher bond that Konoha promoted, that students that had never met before were more accepting over that recommendation alone. Then again, if Kakashi-sensei had other students… yeah, I probably would have been <em> really</em> interested in them.</p><p>I eyed Yakumo thoughtfully as the conversation took off. <em> Dangerous and disturbed</em> , Tsunade had called her. Was that the truth or a layer of misdirection? Would I ever know the difference?</p><p>What was I even doing?</p><p>I rubbed a hand across my eyes wearily.</p><p>I looked up and watched Anko watching us. She seemed intense – alert – but not unhappy. She caught my eye and smirked, like she'd felt me staring at her. She probably had. I was hardly being stealthy.</p><p>I dropped my attention back to Yakumo. She was getting on just fine with the others, and I withdrew a little from the group, watching and waiting. I'd take an opportunity if any presented themselves, but for now, I'd watch and wait.</p><p>It did, in the end. The topic swung away from genjutsu, touched on the medical knowledge that was ostentatiously our reason for meeting, and around to art. Or, more specifically, Yakumo's art.</p><p>"I'd like to see that in action," Sakura said, a little wistfully. "It sounds amazing. The combination of beautiful paintings and deadly genjutsu… a perfect kunoichi art!"</p><p>"Me too," I agreed, propping my chin up on my hand. "It sounds really interesting. Did you want to spar sometime?"</p><p>The words slipped out before I'd really considered them. It was a casual offer, one that got made reasonably regularly but not always followed through on. Once it was out, I wasn't sure if I wanted her to accept it or reject it – on one hand, I actually did want to see them in action. On the other. Well. I had just told myself I was going to watch and wait, hadn't I?</p><p>Yakumo blinked. "Um. Well, I don't know if I can," she said, and threw a look towards Anko.</p><p>Anko shrugged as all our attention focused on her. "Suit yourself," she said.</p><p>"I would like that very much, then," Yakumo said. "I haven't… I haven't had much of an opportunity to practice with other people."</p><p>I swallowed, and pasted on a smile. "Great. I've got a lot of free time at the moment, so whenever it suits you is fine."</p><p>We hashed out a time for the three of us to meet. I wasn't entirely sure that having Sakura be there was a good thing but… well, I wasn't going to say she <em> couldn't</em> be there. Not when I'd sort of jumped on her comment to initiate it.</p><p><em> This is why planning matters.</em></p><p>And then the group broke up, Hinata apologetically taking her leave to make it home on time for dinner, Anko whisking Yakumo away with an offhand wave in our direction and Sakura cheerfully tottering off with a stack of books.</p><p>That just left me and Ino in an empty park, sitting at a picnic table.</p><p>Ino braced her elbows on the table and looked at me over laced fingers.</p><p>"Sorry," I blurted out.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow in surprise.</p><p>"For…" I waved a vague hand. "Inviting Yakumo. Not warning you. Whatever." I shrugged. "I wasn't sure she would come."</p><p>"You don't have to apologize," Ino said, still sounding a little surprised. "The more the merrier, right? And it's not like we've ever stuck to <em> just</em> medical jutsu, even if that's what we started studying. I just wondered when you had time to meet her; Shikamaru made it sound like you were flat out with clan stuff."</p><p>"A bit?" I said. "I mean, none of it is urgent or anything, I just haven't had anything else to do. But, um, I didn't. I mean, I haven't met her before."</p><p>"Okay, now I'm lost," Ino said.</p><p>"Sasuke met her on his last mission," I repeated what I'd said before. "And her technique sounded interesting-" Saying it like that made me sound awful. I had no problems with Tsunade thinking I only wanted to learn her techniques, but it was different with Ino. "-And she sounded lonely and stuff…"</p><p>I cringed. That was terrible. Why was I so awful with words?</p><p>"That was nice of you," Ino said quietly. "I'm glad."</p><p>It was my turn to blink at her in surprise.</p><p>"You get quiet," Ino explained. "When you're uncomfortable or upset… like you don't want to been seen or talk to anyone. And you haven't been around lately, and then you were late today… I was worried that something was wrong."</p><p>"Oh," I said.</p><p>"But, you know," she looked away for a second. "That sounds like something I would have done. Inviting someone along because they sounded lonely."</p><p>"Would do," I corrected. It hung heavily in the air, because neither of us were talking about the grammar of the sentence.</p><p>Then Ino rolled her eyes. "Like something I would do," she corrected and huffed. "Take the compliment, Shikako. Sheesh. Don't be all weird."</p><p>"I'm not weird," I denied. "You're weird."</p><p>I grabbed my bag, darted off the table and stuck my tongue out at her.</p><p>Her mouth dropped open in shock. Then she scrambled after me. "You're weird, weirdo!"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Our team training ground was always free. Either Kakashi-sensei had reserved it for the whole year in preparation for his Genin team – which probably would have taken a fair amount of pull – or people just… didn't go there. Given that it also housed the memorial stone, the latter explanation wasn't as unusual as it initially seemed.</p><p>No one really wanted to interrupt someone else's grief.</p><p>Either way, it meant that I could show up at our Training Ground 3 the next day without worrying that someone else would be there, or having to go to the hassle of reserving it for us.</p><p>"Is this…" Sakura asked worriedly, hands clutched together. "A good idea?"</p><p>I smiled reassuringly at her. "Sure," I said easily. "I want to see her genjutsu in action, don't you? Besides," I added with a tease. "If something goes wrong, we have a medic-nin on hand."</p><p>I had given a bit of thought to how Yakumo might fight, and strategies to deal with that, but the spar itself worried me <em> least</em> out of all the issues here. It was genjutsu. I was pretty damn good at countering that.</p><p>Sakura huffed, but smiled, so I took that as exasperated-but-pleased, and ran through a slow warm up kata while we waited.</p><p>Yakumo arrived right on time, clutching a large artists bag with a combination of nerves and eagerness. Anko strolled casually beside her, hands in her coat pockets, looking for all the world calm and at ease and not like she was actually on a mission.</p><p>"Good morning!" I greeted. "Are you ready?"</p><p>"I really am looking forward to this," Yakumo said. There was something slightly off about her smile that rang warning bells very, very loudly. "Are you both going to be fighting?"</p><p>"Just me to start with," I said easily. "If we get to a round two, then Sakura might join in. Is that okay?"</p><p>Yakumo nodded, still smiling. "I should set up then."</p><p>"Be my guest." Normally, I wouldn't let someone <em> prepare</em> like that. But the whole point was to see her genjutsu in action, which meant letting her use her genjutsu. In a real fight, that would be akin to someone letting me start writing seals all over the floor and I'm pretty sure there was a saying somewhere about giving fuiinjutsu masters time to prepare. It kinda went "<em> don't</em> ".</p><p>She set up an easel and small folding chair, put a blank canvas on it and started mixing paint on a palette. I watched with mild interest as she started painting with impressive speed – green for the ground, blue for the sky, then darker shades that started bringing in details and depth. The training ground took shape on the page, and she started to detail in a single, small figure-</p><p>There was a <em> thrum</em> , a deep, soundless vibration that rattled through the entire <em> world.</em> I dropped to my knees, hand coming up to instinctually press against my chest, even though I knew it wasn't my heart.</p><p>I disrupted my chakra.</p><p>"Kai." I clapped my hands into a seal, trying again, the complete process of genjutsu release that we were taught in the Academy.</p><p>The world looked… exactly the same. Me and her. The training field. But Sakura was gone. Anko was gone. I wondered, if I travelled away from here, how far it would extend. If Konoha was still there, but empty. If Land of Fire was. Further than that? Would it only be things that Yakumo knew and could project? Or things that I knew?</p><p>I swallowed. "This is your genjutsu?"</p><p>Yakumo paused, hand hovering over the canvas. "Yes," she said. "This is the true power of the Kurama clan. This is why I was the one they put their faith in, why I was supposed to restore the greatness of our clan…" She trailed off, completing the stroke of grey. On the canvas the sky being overwritten with dark and ominous clouds.</p><p><em> Lightning strike</em> , I remembered. <em> That's how she attacked the tower.</em></p><p>That was… not good.</p><p>I curled a tiny shard of chakra around my canine tooth, and bit my lip. It sank easily into the flesh, pain shooting out and making my eyes water.</p><p>Nothing changed.</p><p>Up above me, grey clouds started rolling in.</p><p>"It's very impressive," I said. "Genjutsu isn't an art that we see a lot. It's hard to take it to this level."</p><p>The only other greatly impressive genjutsu I had seen was-</p><p>-was-</p><p>My hands shook. I pressed them flat against my thighs. <em> Was Tsukiyomi</em> , I completed the thought, deliberately.</p><p>The parallels hovered around in my brain. <em> Stupid. Stupid. </em> Letting myself be caught in it like this. <em> Inviting </em> it even. I was <em> stupid.</em></p><p>I had to- had to keep it together.</p><p>Had to focus.</p><p>"Yes," Yakumo agreed. "And it makes people… it makes people so <em> jealous.</em> " She sounded distraught.</p><p>I was a little too preoccupied to share her much sympathy.</p><p>"Kurenai-sensei … I thought she would teach me how to be a ninja. That was all I wanted! To live up to the expectations of my clan, to use my genjutsu to serve the village! But she hated me! Was so jealous of what I could do that she never would… She sealed it away, took my potential from me and left me nothing!"</p><p>I blinked, breathing with forced and exaggerated rhythm. "She… sealed you?" My head was aching, like I was being forced in two different directions, like I was splitting straight down the middle.</p><p>"It's breaking now," Yakumo confessed. "I'm getting it back. For so long… I could do nothing. Do you know what that's like? To have it all take away? I hate her. I want to kill her! I want to destroy this whole place!"</p><p><em> Dangerous and disturbed</em> , Tsunade had said. I was seeing it. Why had I doubted her?</p><p>Thunder rattled. Even as she spoke, she hadn't stopped painting. I was learning, but… I really also needed to keep fighting. I didn't want to find out what happened if that attack actually hit me.</p><p>"I-" I said. "I don't know what it's like, to be sealed. But I do know what it's like to be helpless. And … I do know what it's like to lose everything. But, killing Kurenai… destroying the village… that's not actually going to make anything better. You know that, right?"</p><p>The thing was… I couldn't actually feel her genjutsu. There was no probe intruding in my system. Disrupting my chakra hadn't worked, because it <em> wasn't in my chakra.</em> But… that left the very, very puzzling question of how the hell it was working.</p><p>"I do know that," Yakumo agreed. "But it's not just that she sealed me. It's not just that she took away my dreams." She turned to look at me, and there were actually tears in her eyes. "Just before I was sealed, my parents died when our house caught fire. The flames spread quickly, too quickly for my parents to react. But they were <em> Jounin</em> , they would never have been taken off guard like that. By a fire! A fire that mysteriously broke out in board daylight. The investigation ruled it was an accident but the report was sealed and kept secret. I was never allowed to see it."</p><p>I stared at her, stomach twisting nervously. I could make the same connection. Had already made the same connection.</p><p>"My parents were put to death, by order of the Third Hokage!"</p><p>"That's…" I tried to find words. "That's awful." I'd thought about what I would say to Sasuke, when he discovered what had happened, thought about it over and over, but I'd never come up with a set of magic words that would make it better. I couldn't find any now. "But… why?"</p><p>"Because they were jealous!" Yakumo shouted. "I heard them talking about it! Kurenai-sensei and the Hokage! They were afraid of the secret power of the Kurama clan – my power!"</p><p>That wasn't – that wasn't right. The Uchiha had been planning a coup, that was one thing. But…. And how would Yakumo have heard it? The Hokage was the <em> Hokage</em> , it would be too hard to eavesdrop on a conversation like that.</p><p>My head throbbed. The world seemed to be growing darker, like a cloud had moved across the sun. I snuck a glimpse at the painting, but it hadn't changed. Yakumo was still staring at me, chest heaving and eyes running.</p><p>"But," I said slowly, frowning. Something was niggling at me. "If they were going to seal your power anyway…"</p><p>The genjutsu wasn't on me. It was on <em> everything around me.</em> An illusion on reality itself. Her painting was an anchor, recasting the jutsu continuously, so that each time I breathed, each time I blinked or listened or touched, I was taking it in, submitting myself to it.</p><p>Was it still an illusion, when the world itself believed it was true? Until it ended, was it the true reality? What if it didn't end? Could she just leave it here, leave me trapped alone, alone forever?</p><p>Some part of my mind giggled hysterically.</p><p>But if seals, ink and paper and <em> words</em> , could reshape the world, then why not this. I had been right, about that at least. Her art and my seals were not so different.</p><p>The world was growing darker and dimmer. This, I thought with what I considered to be admirable calmness, would be a really, really bad time to pass out.</p><p>"What are you saying?" Yakumo scoffed. "That there was a <em> reason </em> for it? How can there be a reason that justifies what they did?"</p><p>"That's not…" I swallowed again, head splitting. "What I said."</p><p>I blinked, my eyes fuzzing like they were coming uncrossed. I thought… I could see an outline of Sakura. Anko. They were just in black and white, transparent and ghostly. But they were there.</p><p>And Yakumo. Yakumo was there twice. Once in colour, crying and yelling. Once in black and white, frozen in front of her canvas.</p><p>I was seeing double, images sliding apart and re-joining before sliding apart again. They aligned, overlapped, real and illusion at once.</p><p>The pain stopped.</p><p>I was in a genjutsu. (But I was not in a genjutsu.)</p><p>I stood up, breathing calmly, panic faded away to nothing. (My body collapsed to the ground, face pressing against the grass. I could smell the grass, the dirt, could feel the wetness of it against my face. It was real and true, even if everything was greyscale. My fingers twitched, but I was too weak to move it.)</p><p>This wasn't, I knew objectively, a good thing. When I'd trained in the clan jutsu, sometimes I had felt an echo of myself – all the things I pushed away, the things I hid and didn't acknowledge. Right now, it was strong. The mission that I had just had, this conspiracy, the reminder of Tsukiyomi… all those things made it strong.</p><p>If I had shown up to training in this state, dad would have forbidden me from using any jutsu until I dealt with it. To have your shadow become strong enough to <em> separate</em> …</p><p>No, it wasn't good.</p><p>But.</p><p><em> I</em> was in a genjutsu. (I was <em> not</em> in a genjutsu.)</p><p>And that meant that I could fight her. I could multitask – fight her both in here and out there. I couldn't evade the genjutsu, or break it, but I could shield that other part of myself, my shadow, from it. I could be in two places – two <em> worlds </em> – at once.</p><p>"What did they seal, Yakumo?" I asked.</p><p>"I'll show you!" she declared, swiveling to face the painting. Her hand lashed out, white paint striping down the page. (She moved, hand lashing out, white paint striping down the page.)</p><p>I moved, as she did, running even before the brush had touched the page. Lightning was impossibly fast, but she wasn't. (I twitched, couldn't move, but nothing changed. Sakura hovered worriedly, exchanging words I couldn't hear with Anko, but neither interfered.)</p><p>The ground exploded into pieces where I had just been standing. A chunk of stone clipped my shoulder. (The pain was a dull thump, bruising but not breaking. I made a choking sound of pain, unable to stifle it. Tears gathered in my eyes.)</p><p>She looked startled, like she couldn't believe I had dodged it.</p><p>Dodging and running wouldn't get me anywhere. I had to be able to retaliate.</p><p>I reached. Not outwards, but inwards. Found that echo, that duplicate, that line that separated me from myself and-</p><p>-<em> switched.</em></p><p>I gasped into the ground, planting my hands and heaving myself up. Sakura yelled something encouraging, but I was already in motion, racing towards Yakumo and her painting. She was still drawing, readying another attack.</p><p>(I drifted along, a shadow on the ground, barely real enough to hold a form even if I wanted to. I moved closer, inching my way towards her shadow, ready to see if I could still pin her down even inside this illusion.)</p><p>From my kunai pouch I withdrew a knockout tag, hoping that if she was unconscious then her genjutsu would fade. Otherwise I could destroy the painting.</p><p>(<em> Shadow paralysis complete</em> , I thought, and her hand jarred to a halt.)</p><p>She scrambled away, almost falling from her chair, brush and palette landing in the grass and then froze. I darted closer, slapping the tag on her forehead and activated it. There was a long, long second as she fought it, then it took hold and she crumpled.</p><p>I barely caught her, stunned as the genjutsu snapped, the recoil of the technique slamming into my brain.</p><p>I was-</p><p>I was not-</p><p>We both sank to the ground, Yakumo's limp body pressing heavily into my stomach. It wasn't comfortable, but I just … wanted a second before I moved.</p><p>Something sharp dug into my sternum.</p><p>I froze.</p><p>"You are," Yakumo rasped, voice very, very low and distorted. "An obstacle in my path."</p><p>I contorted, heaving Yakumo up and bunching my legs under her body to launch her away. The paper knockout tag floated to the ground, useless. I rolled to my feet, crouching low for balance and stared at her.</p><p>"Secret power of the Kurama clan," I murmured. Sealed away. That was starting to make sense, at the very least.</p><p>It looked like a curse seal transformation. It was almost unnervingly like one. Darkened skin, elongated fangs, protruding horns and black sclera.</p><p>Fuck, but we ran into way too many people that were able to do this.</p><p>It didn't feel like natural energy, as far as I could tell, and it wasn't Gelel. It probably <em> was</em> part of her bloodlimit, but that didn't exactly tell me how to go about defeating it.</p><p>"Yakumo-"</p><p>"I," she rasped. "Am not Yakumo. I am… all the pain that gathered in her mind, all the suffering that could not be alleviated. I am… what protects her."</p><p>I very, very deliberately did not think about the parallels of that or what it could mean for me.</p><p>"You don't need to protect her here. She isn't in danger," I said, putting as much sincere authority in my voice as possible. "No one is going to hurt her."</p><p>"Liar," it rasped. "I felt it. The pain of disappointment is unmistakable to me. The pain of failing to meet the expectations heaped upon her, crushing her with their weight. My purpose is to protect her from it, to obliterate those that are responsible for it. And that means <em> you.</em> "</p><p>I tensed, ready to jump into action. This was not good, but I wasn't out yet. If we were about to get serious, then I could get serious.</p><p>"Annnnd, play time is over," Anko said, cutting in. Her hands flashed through seals even before she started talking, and Yakumo's body froze. She slapped a paper tag on Yakumo's forehead, the same way I had done only minutes ago. I squinted at it, barely catching sight of the writing scribbled across it before it began to glow and sunk through the paper. The transformation undid itself, leaving Yakumo blinking wide-eyed at us.</p><p>She swallowed heavily. "I- I remember now," she said, voice shaking. "The one… the one that killed my parents… was me."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"You were never supposed to find out," Anko said, though it was gentle. "Kurenai sealed the memory away, along with that transformation when it became clear you couldn't control it. Personally, not a decision I agree on." She shrugged, one shoulder rolling more than the other, and my eyes darted to the mark on it. "The question is, though, now that you know what are you going to do?"</p><p>Yakumo's eyes dropped to the ground. "I… I don't know," she whispered. "I… I…" Her eyes began to water and she started to cry.</p><p>Anko sighed, dropping a hand onto her shoulder.</p><p>I straightened from my crouch, now that it seemed everything was over. The adrenaline burst of it all was fading.</p><p>Sakura edged closer to me. "Oh, it'll be fine," she hissed, reaching out with greenly glowing hands. "This does not look <em> fine.</em> "</p><p>I hesitated. "Looks pretty good to me," I murmured back to her. No one was dead and the truth was out, and it was much less terrifying than it could have been.</p><p>"Says the Shikabane-hime," she said, sounding torn being fright and annoyance.</p><p>I blinked at her, startled. . It wasn't an entirely <em> positive</em> response, but it wasn't as bad as it could be. And I'd made that joke in the first place… so, it kinda was supportive in a backwards way.</p><p>Although I wasn't entirely sure where she'd got 'princess' from.</p><p>"Yes?" I said uncertainly. "Everyone came out of it okay."</p><p>Her hands moved over my shoulder, chakra sinking in and easing the bruise there. I almost told her not to bother, but thought that that might lead to another fight. Better to just sit silently and let her heal. Once she was done, she even went as far as to touch a thumb to my lip and heal the tiny bite mark there.</p><p>"There. All done." She cast a critical look over me, like she might have missed something with her scan.</p><p>I thanked her, because it wasn't like I <em> liked</em> being in pain. I just didn't like the fuss that people made over the injuries.</p><p>"We're off, then," Anko said, wrapping an arm around Yakumo's shoulders and giving us a lazy two fingered salute.</p><p>"See you next time!" I said hastily, since we hadn't really discussed any future plans.</p><p>The two of them vanished in a cloud of chakra smoke and body flicker.</p><p>"I don't really understand what just happened there," Sakura admitted.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Yakumo Arc: Chapter 75</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: ThoughtBubble – believe it or not, I've had thoughts in that direction for a while, using sealing to make it. It's just there are so many ideas that it hasn't been brought up.</p><p>ImpressedAnon: That's pretty much it. The shadow jutsu side effects, and reincarnation side effects combining for interesting results. The second part is metaphorical, not literal – though it would make for an interesting SI twist, that's for sure.</p><p>Violet-skya has put up the second part of their lovely Chapter 70 comic, and there are a few more pieces of fanart that I recommend everyone check out. Links are in my profile as per normal.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 75</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> And they settle 'neath your skin</p><p>Kept on the inside and no sunlight</p><p>Sometimes a shadow wins</em></p><p><em> ~Sarah Bareilles; Brave</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Were you waiting for me?" Sasuke asked, dropping to sit beside me on the edge of the roof. Given that it was the top of his apartment building we were perched on, I assumed that was a rhetorical question.</p><p>I swung my legs idly, heels drumming against the brick wall below us. "I just wanted some peace and quiet," I said, closing my book.</p><p>"Peace and quiet," Sasuke repeated, deadpan, with a look at the bustling street below us. It was residential district, not commercial, but there was still a decent number of people coming and going. And that didn't even count the traffic on the roof tops behind us.</p><p>"Mmm," I agreed, because it might be there, but I didn't have to interact with it and that was good enough. Home, my usual bastion of quiet, meant Shikamaru. Meant mom. Meant research.</p><p>I was perfectly aware that hiding from my problems didn't fix them. I knew that. But sometimes it just took a bit of time to work up the motivation and energy to do anything about them.</p><p>"You should walk me home," I said.</p><p>Sasuke blinked at me, drawing a knee up and hooking his forearm over it. "I should, should I?"</p><p>Given what I'd learnt, it probably wasn't essential to drag Sasuke to the Nara grounds to talk about Yakumo, but at the same time, I hardly wanted to talk about it <em> here.</em></p><p>"Unless you've got something better to do?" I slid backwards, stood up and offered him a hand.</p><p>Sasuke sighed, but took it and let me haul him to his feet. "You never used to be this bossy."</p><p>"You were fooled by my calm and pleasant demeanour," I said, deadpan. "Now that you know the truth you shall never be allowed to escape. Mwahaha. Ha."</p><p>He rolled his eyes at me.</p><p>We roof hopped towards the Nara compound. Once upon a time, I would have looked at the distances between the roofs and gone 'no way', but now it barely even seemed like an obstacle. A quick application of chakra into a Leaping Monkey technique that was drilled into us well before we left the Academy, and you were bouncing over the gaps like they weren't even there.</p><p>Shikamaru was sitting out on the veranda, playing solo shogi, when we got home. I gave him a half-hearted wave and proceeded to drag Sasuke around the house and towards the forest rather than say hi.</p><p>It didn't go unnoticed.</p><p>"What was that about?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>I shrugged. "He doubts my ability to make valid life choices."</p><p>"I doubt your ability to make valid life choices," Sasuke said dryly.</p><p>I shoved him with my shoulder. "You would make the exact same ones, so you don't even get to voice an opinion." The idea that Sasuke would quit being a ninja because it was dangerous and he got hurt was laughable.</p><p>"Alright," Sasuke said, once we were in the forest. "What's wrong now?"</p><p>I dropped down to sit with my back against a tree trunk. "Listen closely, this is probably going to be the only time I say this." I took a deep breath. I hated to admit it, but even if I explained he was going to call me on it. "I was wrong."</p><p>"Can I get that in writing?" Sasuke smirked.</p><p>"No." I waggled my finger at him. "I was wrong. Yakumo was wrong. The actual truth is something like this. Yakumo had a very strong expression of her clan's bloodlimit, but she was otherwise pretty sick as a kid. She still wanted to be a ninja, but it didn't look like it was possible. And then the Kurama clan started declining in strength right at the point where the village needed more genjutsu users, so people were looking to Yakumo's talent to restore them. That put a lot of stress on her, as you can imagine. She then developed a secondary personality to protect herself," I summarised. "I don't know if the Kurama have a secondary bloodlimit, or if it was just an odd manifestation of the main one, but it was able to take control with a transformation not unlike the curse seal."</p><p>Sasuke blinked at me.</p><p>"Not like-like," I clarified. "But the whole demonic appearance thing. Anyway. Said personality was trying to protect her from all that stress, and was maybe fuelled by resentment against the clan for putting it there in the first place, and used her genjutsu abilities to cast a fire."</p><p>"That killed her parents," Sasuke said quietly, filling in the blanks.</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed. "The Third apparently was aware of it, and organised Kurenai-sensei to either teach her to control it or seal it away along with all her memories of the event. She chose the latter option, obviously. Then they put Yakumo under house arrest and observation. Only, the seal started breaking down recently, and she was recovering her powers, hence the attack on the Tower."</p><p>"So she knows now?"</p><p>"She knows now," I confirmed. "Anko took her away again. I hope she's okay."</p><p>Sasuke shook his head, staring out into the trees. "That's crazy," he said quietly. "How awful would it be…"</p><p>I wasn't sure I was supposed to hear that. I leant back and waited.</p><p>"But," he said after a moment. "I don't get why you believed her in the first place. I mean, maybe not guessing all of<em> that</em> but it makes more sense if you just assumed she didn't know what she was talking about. But you didn't. You believed her. You never even met her and you believed her."</p><p>It was hard to defend myself while knowing I had been <em> wrong</em> . Anything I said now was just going to sound paranoid. I huffed. "Because that's the kind of accusation you take <em> seriously?"</em></p><p>"This is Konoha," Sasuke said with a bite of impatience. "Not Hidden Mist. Do you really think that kind of thing goes on here?"</p><p><em> Oh, Sasuke.</em> My heart ached for him.</p><p>But maybe it was better if he didn't believe it. If he thought Konoha just wasn't capable of that level of treachery. Maybe then, when the other shoe dropped, when the truth was revealed, he would doubt it. Maybe it would take away one weapon that Tobi had to use against him. Maybe.</p><p>Or maybe it would just make the betrayal all that much greater.</p><p>I ran a hand through my hair, ruffling my fringe. "Sorry." I swallowed. "Maybe I'm just paranoid."</p><p>I didn't look at him, so I didn't know how that went over. But he didn't say anything.</p><p>"How'd you find all this out anyway?" Sasuke asked, after a beat. "Did she get out again?"</p><p>"Oh, I invited her sparring," I said. "The seal broke while we were fighting."</p><p>There was a long silence.</p><p>"What?" he asked incredulously.</p><p>"I… invited her sparring?" I repeated uncertainly.</p><p>"That is the <em> stupidest</em> <em> thing I have ever heard,</em> " Sasuke said flatly. "You invited her sparring? She wanted to destroy Konoha! I told you what her genjutsu were like! And you just thought 'oh, no, that sounds absolutely <em> perfect, </em> I'll let her cast one on me<em> '</em> ?"</p><p>"I-" I stammered, eyes wide. "It wasn't that bad," I muttered defensively.</p><p>Sasuke breathed very deeply through his nose. "No. Shikako. I thought Naruto was supposed to be the one that leapt into things without thinking about them."</p><p>"Hey," I objected. "I thought about it."</p><p>"Really?" he asked. "And it still seemed like a good idea after that?"</p><p>I didn't really appreciate this. "It all worked out in the end!"</p><p>"That doesn't mean it was clever," Sasuke argued. "You have to see that that was a moronic plan."</p><p>I stopped myself from snapping at him. The fact that I <em> wanted</em> to snap meant he was probably closer to the truth than I wanted to admit. I was feeling cornered – I <em> hated</em> feeling cornered – and it was because he was right. "It… wasn't the best plan I could have made?" I admitted in a small voice. It wasn't. Even the 'ask Tsunade' stage of the plan hadn't been brilliant. I'd been scrambling from start to finish, and I was really lucky that nothing had backfired on me.</p><p>"And you did it <em> alone</em> ," Sasuke said. "I wish you'd..."</p><p>"Look, Anko was there as her guard, okay?" I said. "And Sakura. It wasn't like I was completely alone."</p><p>Sasuke gave me a baleful look that said the minor concession to safety did not impress him at all. "I just- Why?"</p><p>I drummed my fingers against my thigh, and ordered my words carefully. "We haven't really fought any serious genjutsu users. It's a rare art to do well."</p><p>"There was-" And he cut himself off, scowling.</p><p>"There was Itachi," I finished softly. "Yeah. But… Itachi is Itachi. Saying he uses genjutsu is like saying a Jounin and a Genin are both ninja so you can fight either one. He's in a different league." I struggled to put it into words. "Yakumo is like <em> us.</em> She's our age, with the same or less training. Strong bloodlimit or not… I thought that… it would be good practice…"</p><p>"Yeah," Sasuke said, and he looked suddenly tired. Drained. I thought that this was probably the most that we had ever discussed about Itachi. Maybe we should have talked about it, but what was there to say?</p><p>I felt pretty drained too. "If," I said, "I meet her again, do you want to come too? Maybe not spar, but just… exchange notes or whatever." I shrugged. It sounded like a neat solution, but I was clearly not having as many great ideas as I thought I was.</p><p>But he wasn't wrong. And… I didn't really want to do this alone if I didn't have to.</p><p>"Maybe," Sasuke said.</p><p>That was good enough for me.</p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Shikamaru rapped his knuckles against my open door. "Naruto is here," he said, tone bored.</p><p>I closed the book on chakra theory that Takatori had sourced for me, and looked at him. "He's back already?"</p><p>Well, it had been almost a week... It seemed much shorter than that somehow.</p><p>"Hey, Shikako!" Naruto cheered as I came down the stairs. "Are you okay? Is your medical leave over? Can you come back to training now? I hope we can do a mission together soon, that would be awesome! Not that it was bad to do a mission with Lee's team, but I missed you and Sasuke."</p><p>I paused under the barrage of words for a second, and tried to parse them. "Uh, nearly over, yeah," I agreed. "How was your mission?"</p><p>"It was okay," he said, and shrugged. "There was this curry restaurant that we stayed at that Lee knew – he trained near there with Gai-sensei last year, he said, and baa-chan remembered him so she made us special curry, but it was so hot. And the town was being controlled and stuff by this missing-nin guy called Raiga, and he used to be one of the Seven Swordsmen. I asked if he knew Zabuza, but then he just got mad at me."</p><p>"Raiga Kurosuki?" Shikamaru asked, looking a little poleaxed.</p><p>"Mmm, I guess so." Naruto shrugged. "He was really nuts though. Like, crazy-nuts. He had a cool apprentice though. His name was Ranmaru. Hey, do you think all the swordsmen had apprentices? Like, Zabuza had Haku?"</p><p>"I don't think so," I said, amused. "Kisame didn't have one." That I knew of, at least.</p><p>"Oh, hey, he was one of them too! I forgot. I should have asked if he knew him." Naruto punched a fist into his other hand. "Rats. I coulda, like, gathered information. Then next time we saw him, we could have kicked his ass. Stupid blue fish guy!"</p><p>Well, at least he was considering gathering information. That was something. "So Ranmaru?" I prompted.</p><p>"Oh, yeah, he had some weird doujutsu," Naruto said. "And he was sick so he couldn't move very much? Raiga basically carried him around all the time. And he was kinda like Haku, too, because he only wanted to be acknowledged and useful to the person he cared about. Except Raiga was even more of a jerk than Zabuza."</p><p>Naruto even sounded disappointed, like that was a serious level of jerkiness to achieve.</p><p>"We had to fight him. He had a lightning sword too. But it wasn't as cool as yours," he added generously. "We were awesome though, and he didn't stand a chance! Ranmaru even helped us out."</p><p>I wondered if it had truly been <em> that</em> easy, given that Raiga was in fact a Jounin member of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist. On the other hand, if he wasn't injured, no one on the team was dead or massively hurt, then did I really need a play by play?</p><p>"But you can come to the hospital tomorrow and meet him, right?" Naruto added. "Baa-chan said she could probably even heal him and stuff."</p><p>"Wait," I said, confused. "Heal who? Who's at the hospital?"</p><p>"Ranmaru," Naruto said, as if I should have followed that.</p><p>"He… came back with you?" I repeated faintly. More surprising than Naruto befriending an enemy was that Tsunade would let him in the village. Even for a doujutsu.</p><p>"Yeah! You'll come and meet him, right?" Naruto said.</p><p>I shared a long look with Shikamaru, both of us on the same wavelength for now, just so we could communicate our disbelief with someone that understood.</p><p>"Sure, why not?" I sighed.</p><p>"Awesome!" Naruto beamed. "So, uh, what have you guys been doing?"</p><p>"Nothing really." I shrugged. "Hanging out, taking things easy. Doing a lot of reading."</p><p>Naruto made a face. "I suppose that's good," he said, clearly of the opinion that it was very boring.</p><p>"And playing shogi," I said thoughtfully, struck by a little spark of inspiration.</p><p>"Oh yeah?" Naruto perked up. "I haven't played in ages." He folded his arms behind his head. "Can we play the cool way? Please?"</p><p>"The cool way?" Shikamaru asked sardonically.</p><p>"Let's go outside." I grinned, sliding open the door and stepping out onto the veranda. There was more than enough space in the backyard. "The floor is yours, Naruto."</p><p>He clapped his hands together, fingers twisting into a cross seal. There was a surge of chakra, and the yard filled with clones, already arrayed in varied outfits of black and white.</p><p>Shikamaru made a sound of surprise.</p><p>"Hey," I said, as if it had just occurred to me. "Why don't we add some more rules to keep it interesting?" Naruto was better at it this way, where it was actually <em> people</em> rather than just game pieces, but Shikamaru would still wipe him away. Not only did he know the game inside and out, he also had experience. Shogi was a game with a lot of history, a lot of set plays that you could make and counter.</p><p>I could throw a curveball into that.</p><p>"We can give the Genin elemental affinities. Then each one can only defeat the affinities that it's advantaged against. Fire beats wind beats lightning beats earth beats water beats fire," I rattled off quickly. "There are only nine of them, though, so two of everything except wind? Because it's so rare in Konoha."</p><p>I actually had no idea how this change would impact the game. But it would impact it big time.</p><p>"You can't just add rules to shogi," Shikamaru said.</p><p>"Can," I replied, very maturely. "Did."</p><p>"Hehe, that sounds fun!" Naruto said, and the front row of players altered their transformations so that their headbands showed an element sign rather than the Konoha symbol.</p><p>Shikamaru narrowed his eyes at us, and folded his hands into a circle.</p><p>The game was on.</p><p>It was messy and it was chaotic. Naruto and I played off each other, argued, and occasionally got in the way of move sets the other was planning. Shikamaru plotted and planned, succeeded and was foiled time and time again. The change to the pawns, the genin, really did upset the whole thing quite a bit. His carefully learnt stratagems were obsolete, and he had to adapt to new and changing circumstances, just like we did.</p><p>I was quite pleased with that.</p><p>"Checkmate," I said, as the last clone moved into place. Naruto punched a fist into the air.</p><p>Shikamaru considered the field, eyes sparking. "Again."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I waited outside the hospital for Naruto to arrive, and was mildly surprised to see Sasuke in tow when he did.</p><p>"Lucky Sevens together again, nah?" I said cheerfully, as we brushed past reception. Naruto seemed to know where he was going.</p><p>Sasuke gave me a bland look. "Don't call us that," he said. "It'll stick."</p><p>"I didn't think it was that bad," I teased. "It's pretty funny even."</p><p>"You say that now," he said.</p><p>I shrugged. "Better the 'Rookie Nine', though you have to give it points for being descriptive."</p><p>We wove through a waiting room where there was a single Chunin flipping idly through an out of date gardening magazine, and knocked on a door.</p><p>"Hey Ranmaru!" Naruto called, stepping inside.</p><p>I was a little surprised. When Naruto had said 'apprentice' and described him like Haku, I had thought he would be our age. But he wasn't. Seven or eight at most, and very small. Youth didn't mean he <em> wasn't</em> dangerous but… Maybe that accounted for Tsunade's lenience.</p><p>He had blue hair and red eyes. Why was it always red eyes? Why couldn't there be a doujutsu that was a nice shade of green? But no, it was always red.</p><p>"Naruto," Ranmaru said quietly, but he smiled. "You came to visit me."</p><p>"Yeah, well I said I would, didn't I?" Naruto said awkwardly. "This is Sasuke and Shikako, my teammates."</p><p>I waved. "Hey. Welcome to Konoha."</p><p>Sasuke offered a nod, and Naruto took off chattering. I had a quick nosy at the hospital notes sitting by the foot of the bed, but it was only Care And Feeding Of type instructions, so there was a limited amount I could glean from that.</p><p>"So, I forgot to ask last time, but Raiga was one of the Mist Swordsmen, right? Did you ever see this blue guy, with a bandage wrapped sword?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"You mean Kisame?" Ranmaru asked. He frowned. "I know he slipped away from Kiri, but I don't know any more than that…"</p><p>"Aww, man," Naruto complained. "That's nothing."</p><p>"Sorry."</p><p>"No, it's not your fault." Naruto waved a hand. "We just ran into him once."</p><p>Even Sasuke looked a little disappointed at the lack of information. I guessed that Naruto had used the possibility as an excuse to drag him along.</p><p>It wasn't much longer before we left, though Naruto managed to convince us both to go to Ichiraku with him. It wasn't even lunchtime yet. Distance apparently made the heart grow fonder, because we both caved with minimal arguing. Sasuke barely did more than sigh.</p><p>"Oh, hey! Old man Genno!" Naruto called, sliding into the seat. "You're having an early lunch!"</p><p>The old man looked up in surprise, but chuckled warmly. "Ah, Naruto! I haven't seen you in a while. Yes, we just finished the last of the Academy upgrades this morning, which means my contract is finished. I was here to celebrate with a last bowl of Ichiraku."</p><p>Sasuke and I slid into seats next to Naruto and ordered from Ayame. Somehow, it didn't surprise me at all that Naruto made friends with other ramen stand patrons.</p><p>"So you're leaving Konoha then?" Naruto said, looking a little crestfallen. "That sucks! We won't be able to see each other anymore. But I guess you're going to go treasure hunting with your grandson like you said, now, right?"</p><p>"Yes, that's right. It's been a long time since I had a good treasure hunt." He looked a little wistful. "Actually, it's lucky that you're here. I had a bit of a present for you, before I went." He winked. "It's a surprise though. You'll have to wait till tomorrow."</p><p>Naruto practically vibrated in his seat. "A present?! For me? No way!" He then proceeded to pester the guy for details, and got nowhere.</p><p>I smiled, but politely stayed out of the obviously familiar conversation.</p><p><hr /></p><p>However tempting it was to hang out with Naruto and Sasuke all day – and it was tempting – I left after we'd batted each other around the training field for a good hour. I had things to do.</p><p>Things that I had been putting off.</p><p>I wandered back to the Nara compound, going over the potential conversations in my head, the way I would plan a battle. It helped keep the nerves under control.</p><p>I walked slowly, curving through the woods, past a small clumping of houses until I found the one I wanted. I didn't bother knocking on the door; he wouldn't be inside anyway.</p><p>Kasuga Nara sighed when he saw me. "Your brother just left, girl," he complained. "No point looking for him here."</p><p>I bobbed a quick bow. "I know, ojii-san."</p><p>He wasn't my grandfather– Shikano Nara's death during the Third Shinobi War had been what promoted dad to Clan Head – but he was grandfatherly enough. Clever and cagey, but still kind, and he'd been the one supervising our training while dad was gone. I figured he was knowledgeable enough – and experienced enough – to be my best chance of getting answers.</p><p>That answer didn't make him happy, no matter how politely I'd said it. "Oh," he said, a displeased twist to his lips. "This is going to be one of <em> those</em> conversations isn't it." He looked me over, a long, shrewd stare.</p><p>I tried not to fidget, but didn't say anything. The more I said, the more I gave away. If I gave things away, it would at least have to be for benefit, not in the opening moves of the game.</p><p>"Go on then, girl," he said at last. "Make us some tea. And do it properly!"</p><p>I shuffled inside, switching my sandals for house slippers as I went. 'Properly' meant not just banging a tea bag and some hot water in a cup, though thankfully not the full bowing and scraping of a formal tea ceremony. I would probably wouldn't have come here until I was desperate, if I thought I would have to go to those lengths.</p><p>I shuffled back outside with the tea tray, and set it down on the veranda, kneeling down in seiza beside it to mirror Kasuga. I poured the tea, and waited until he'd taken the first considering sip.</p><p>"Alright," he said. "What is it? Though, if it's womanly problems, I reserve the right to tell you to go ask your mother."</p><p>I was at once bemused by the sheer idea that I would come to him with <em> womanly problems </em> in the first place – and what did that even mean, honestly – and jumpy with anxiety over having to initiate this conversation.</p><p>"I'm good," I said dryly, taking a sip of green tea. I let the cup rest on my knees. "The clan jutsu." I paused, both to pick my words carefully, and also partially in hope that he would take the opening and answer my questions before I had to ask them.</p><p>He didn't.</p><p>Well, I'd always known I wasn't going to get out of this without admitting that something was wrong.</p><p>"There are side effects, to the clan jutsu, aren't there?" I asked, carefully casual.</p><p>"There can be," he agreed, neutrally. "Especially if you do it wrong. Sometimes, even if you do it right."</p><p>I nodded. Took a calming breath. "What are the common consequences of incorrect usage?"</p><p>There was a pause. Of course he knew what I was really asking. I knew what I was admitting to. I hated to admit it, but I needed to know what to do next.</p><p>"Why don't you tell me what's wrong," he said. "And then I will tell you why."</p><p>"Sometimes," I said, "when I use the clan jutsu, I hear an echo."</p><p>Kasuga's hands stilled around his cup. The look he gave me was just as steady and assessing as the first. "An echo of what?"</p><p>"Me." It sounded dumb. But I kept silent, resisted the urge to try and explain further, because there weren't really words that I could use to explain. I'd only babble and get myself all tangled up. Everything I could try boiled down to that. He'd either understand, or he wouldn't.</p><p>"Oh, girl. You always were the problem child." He sighed. "When did it start?"</p><p>"Only recently," I said, even though I wasn't sure it was completely true. But I'd <em> split</em> myself, and that was the part that worried me.</p><p>He took a sip of his tea. "I'm sure your father gave you the run down on the dangers of spiritual manipulation."</p><p>"That's why I'm here," I responded. I knew the seriousness of it.</p><p>"Don't get snippy with me," he chided. "Your little <em> echo</em> is what happens when things don't line up quite right."</p><p>I nodded, because I'd realised that much.</p><p>"The problem," he explained. "Is cohesion. Ideally, you want to be manipulating your energy so that it maintains the same shadow-density throughout. The best way for that to happen is to have all your spiritual energy on the same wavelength and cycling interchangeably. In theory, easy enough. In practice, it's not an ideal that's easy to live up to."</p><p>I frowned. That was all information I knew, but put together like this was giving me a niggling of an answer. "What happens when there are … different densities? How do you <em> get</em> different densities in spiritual energy?"</p><p>He huffed. "How do you think, girl? It's spiritual energy. It's made up of all your thoughts and feelings, hopes and dreams. You strengthen one part over another, they don't mix together properly and all of a sudden you get gradients. If the differences get too extreme… that would be your little echo."</p><p><em> Shit.</em> I could see it. How it had happened, though… I'd always considered myself to be fairly self-aware. Sure, I put things to the side, sometimes, but it wasn't like I was fooling myself.</p><p>Was I?</p><p>"How do I fix it?" I asked flatly.</p><p>Kasuga gave me a long, mildly amused look. "That very much depends on what you mean by 'fix'."</p><p>It was too much to hope that it would be simple or easy, of course. I knew that much. But the prevarication didn't make me any happier.</p><p>"To make it go away?" I suggested.</p><p>"Quit as a ninja," he said, as if it were the easiest thing in the world. "Stop using shadow jutsu at all."</p><p>"No." It wasn't an option. I couldn't let it <em> be </em> an option. There had to be something else.</p><p>"Then that's not what you mean by 'fixed'," he said, equally straight forward.</p><p>I tried to hide the face I made by drinking my tea. I suspected that it didn't work very well. "Then how about something like… controlled with enough assurance that I can be trusted to operate on missions and not endanger people around me?"</p><p>The worst thing I could think of – the most terrible, horrifying thing – would be to become Yakumo. To wake up and know that <em> I</em> had been the one to kill someone I cared about. It was that possibility, shoved so brutally in my face, that made me search for answers.</p><p>Kasuga turned the full weight of his attention on me. "Did something happen, Shikako?"</p><p>I pulled back, feeling too exposed. "No. I just want to eliminate it as a possibility." Nothing had happened, not with me. I just didn't want it to get to the point where it <em> did. </em></p><p>"Do you think it <em> is</em> a possibility?" he asked.</p><p>I hesitated. How should I know? I wasn't the expert on shadow jutsu, here. I was guessing blindly. "I don't want it to be."</p><p>He stared at me for a long time, frown settling between his eyes. I began to feel like I'd made a mistake. Somehow, somewhere along the line, I had made a mistake.</p><p>"I have some exercises you can do," he said finally. He stood with a groan and a creaking knee. "Come inside."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I woke, close to four am, from the sound of a muffled explosion.</p><p>It was distant, maybe even clear on the other side of Konoha, but unmistakable all the same. I listened carefully, but there was no follow up explosion. There was no alarm. There was nothing.</p><p>I got up.</p><p>No alarm meant there was no immediate response necessary. But I doubted there were many shinobi in Konoha that could hear an explosion in the middle of the night and not worry.</p><p>I moved through the house until I could look out the window and have a clear view of a signalling station. Sure enough, the village security level had been increased, and there was an additional 'curfew in effect' lamp burning. There was an 'in pursuit of suspect' signal, but none of the lights that indicated who was in charge of the operation, or who to defer to if you became caught up in it.</p><p>"Anbu," Shikamaru murmured behind me, fighting a yawn. "Go back to sleep."</p><p>I made an agreeable sound, leaning on the window frame. <em> Want to remind me how safe the village is?</em> I didn't say.</p><p><hr /></p><p>There was a knock on the door while we were still eating breakfast. I could tell it was Sasuke – I'd felt his chakra come – and wondered if it were too much to hope that he was just stopping by for food.</p><p>It was.</p><p>"Mission," he said curtly, looking far too awake. I wondered if he'd been up for whatever had happened last night.</p><p>"Both of us?" Shikamaru asked with a yawn, eyes flicking over to me. "What a drag."</p><p>Sasuke shrugged a shoulder. "You have to report to the Hokage. We're supposed to collect the rest of the team."</p><p>"How many?" I asked, hurriedly finishing eating so I could go grab my stuff.</p><p>"Us, Team Eight, Team Ten and Team Gai," Sasuke replied.</p><p>I paused and looked over at him. "All of the Konoha Twelve, huh?" Damn. It must be something big. I was literally only just finished with my medical leave. I hadn't even reported in for a change in status yet.</p><p>Shikamaru stood and stretched his arms above his head. "Troublesome," he muttered, clicking his neck to the side. "I guess I better go and see what Hokage-sama wants." He sounded completely unenthusiastic, grabbing his Chunin vest from the hook by the door.</p><p>I sighed. "Gimme a second?" I asked, rushing up the stairs to get changed into more mission appropriate gear.</p><p>There was no rest for the wicked, around here.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Trap Master Arc: Chapter 76</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Also many, many thanks to erimies who has very patiently listened to me ramble about DOS for the last couple of months, and been inundated with half-formed ideas. She's just started her own fic 'The Clan of Samsara' with a whole sweep of reincarnates. I really recommend it. XD</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 76</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> One may go a long way after one is tired. ~French Proverb</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>There were a few conference rooms in the tower big enough to accommodate a group of twelve. Not the kind with a table and chairs, but there was floor space and a pile of seiza cushions to kneel on.</p><p>It felt weirdly formal, but this was a mission briefing, so maybe the weirdness was that I was used to them being <em> in</em> formal?</p><p>The atmosphere in the room was more boisterous than tense, however. There was a bit of wild speculating going around – I wasn't the only one who thought that getting these four teams together was a sign of something big – but no one had any more information, or was willing to share if they did.</p><p>"Ah, damn," Kiba moaned at me. "That's the last time I come to you for information."</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him. "I only found out this morning, same as you did," I complained back. "How am I supposed to know more?"</p><p>"I don't know, but you always do," he said. "Come on, Shino, back me up." He nudged his teammate with a shoulder.</p><p>Shino shifted his glasses in a move that seemed to convey mild exasperation. "It is illogical to assume that Shikako would be privy to more information than we are in possession of. Why? Because the rapid assemblage of multiple teams indicates an emergency response."</p><p>I smirked at Kiba. "I think that means he's on my side. And it's good to see you again, Shino. It's been a while."</p><p>"Yes, it is pleasing to be involved this time," Shino said. And wow, that was a little passive aggressive, wasn't it.</p><p>"Hey, you know you were the first one we asked for last time," I said, because being left out of the group sucked. I knew that. "And I, for one, would have really liked you to be there. There was a particular giant spider I would have left all for you."</p><p>"Hey," Kiba butted in. "I thought we'd agreed not to mention that." In his jacket, Akamaru made a sad growling noise at me.</p><p>"Sorry, Kiba. I'm bad at secrets." We shared a smirk, because the back and forth banter was just so <em> easy.</em></p><p>"Then I will endeavour to be around in future," Shino said, looking pleased. "In order to protect you from spiders."</p><p>It startled an actual laugh out of me. Shino's sense of humour tended to take people by surprise. "Now there's a promise I can accept," I said with amusement. "Careful, Shino. You keep sweet talking like that and you'll have a fan club the size of Sasuke's."</p><p>Shikamaru slouched in nearly half an hour later, a sheath of papers held loosely in one hand. "Everyone's here?" he asked rhetorically, running a hand through his hair. "Great."</p><p>"Oh, don't sound so enthusiastic!" Ino said irritably. "You better not have been keeping us waiting just so you could dither around-"</p><p>Chouji wrapped an arm around her shoulder to stop her from getting up and possibly assaulting our team leader. I would have wondered if Ino was on edge because this was her first mission since her injury, except that was actually fairly normal Shikamaru and Ino interaction.</p><p>Beside me, Naruto muffled a snicker.</p><p>Shikamaru sighed, and rolled his shoulders back until he looked at least vaguely at attention. "Alright, everyone pay attention. This mission comes direct from the Hokage. It's A-rank, classified, and extremely sensitive."</p><p>Several people straightened at the information. Naruto perked up. Even now, the promise of a high ranked mission was like candy to him.</p><p>"It have anything to do with those explosions last night?" Kiba asked, guessing what we had all suspected was the reason for this meeting. "Village security went up another level this morning, too."</p><p>"Yeah." Shikamaru gave a brief nod in his direction. "Just let me explain. The explosions last night were part of an Anbu operation to bring in a fugitive who had infiltrated the village. He evaded them for a while, but was eventually cornered and refused to surrender, setting off a bunch of explosive notes. He was pronounced dead at the scene."</p><p>There was a shift of confusion amidst the teams.</p><p>"I do not understand," Lee said. "If the target is dead, then what is our mission?"</p><p>"I'm getting to it," Shikamaru said, eyes dropping to his papers for a second. "As far as I know, the Anbu had him under surveillance for about two weeks and the reason that they attempted to bring him in last night was that, last night, he finally made a move. He broke into the construction company headquarters and made off with a bunch of important blueprints."</p><p><em> Oh, shit.</em></p><p>I wasn't the only one that seemed to be thinking that.</p><p>"I don't get it," Naruto said, looking around at the rest of us. "What's so important about a bunch of blueprints?" He frowned, turning slightly towards me and Sasuke, but it was Neji who answered him.</p><p>"If Konoha's enemies got their hands on those blueprints, it could be disastrous," Neji said, and he didn't sound at all put out about having to explain something that should have been obvious. "Once they have a detailed analysis of the structures within the village, it would be a simple matter to find the most efficient way to break in or cause harm."</p><p>Realisation stole across Naruto's face. "Oh, yeah. That would be bad," he agreed.</p><p>"The Anbu searched the blast site," Shikamaru continued. "But they concluded he was unlikely to have been in possession of the plans at the time. Which is where we come in."</p><p>"Can we be certain that the blueprints are still within Konoha?" Shino asked quietly. "Because the most logical conclusion is to assume that the reason the infiltrator was not in possession of the plans is because they have already been delivered."</p><p>"No," Shikamaru said seriously. "We can't. We can only hope that the plans aren't already in the hands of our enemies."</p><p>That was sobering. The last thing Konoha needed right now was a gigantic hole in our defences. If Hidden Cloud were serious about attacking us, then that would be an opportunity that they simply wouldn't be able to pass up. We would have an invasion on our door step in weeks.</p><p>I'd never known anything about another invasion, but after Gelel, I was reluctant to assume that meant anything at all. I didn't – desperately <em> did not</em> – want to be wrong.</p><p>"Additionally," Shikamaru continued. "This guy has a reputation for setting some pretty nasty traps, so we're likely to run into some during this mission. Keep your eyes open."</p><p>"Understood," Ino nodded firmly. "Just tell us where to start looking."</p><p>"We'll start by heading to the construction HQ," Shikamaru said. "They've put together a list of plans that are missing, so we know what to look for." He handed out the pages that he was carrying. "This is the dossier for the guy. He came into the village a few months ago, in the guise of a carpenter."</p><p>"No!" Naruto protested loudly, shooting to his feet. The dossier page was clutched crumpled in his hand. "This has to be wrong."</p><p>I shared a glance with Sasuke, then grabbed one of the pages myself. At first glance, I couldn't see anything wrong. The photo was nigglingly familiar for a few moments, before I managed to place it.</p><p>"The old man from the ramen stand," I said with resignation. "You know him, Naruto?" Of course he did. That was another layer of complication to a mission that didn't look simple to start with.</p><p>Naruto nodded vigorously. "Old man Genno doesn't have a mean bone in his body!" He said. "There's no <em> way</em> he's some kind of imposter ninja."</p><p>There were other people trading glances too. They did not seem overly supportive.</p><p>"Maybe that's what he wanted you to think," Kiba said with a snort. "Sure looks like it."</p><p>Naruto glared. "No. I knew him, okay?"</p><p>"Maybe you didn't," Sasuke said quietly. "Sometimes you don't." He wasn't looking at either Naruto or the information page, and the comment wasn't even that loud.</p><p>I sucked in a breath, the words I was going to say getting caught in my throat. I could see so much meaning behind those words.</p><p><em> Sasuke, are you-</em></p><p>"I <em> did,"</em> Naruto insisted, steamrolling right over the protests with sheer bullheadedness. "And I'm saying that he wouldn't do something like this. There's a mistake."</p><p>Shikamaru sighed. "Come on, Naruto. He might have seemed harmless, but it was an act. He wanted us to let our guards down. And it worked."</p><p>Naruto clenched his jaw, ready to burst into another round of protests. I could see the divisions in the room forming, of people siding against him. Hinata was nervously twisting her fingers, glancing between Naruto and her team. I could see she <em> wanted</em> to believe him, but wasn't convinced of the logic of it. Lee, maybe, could be swayed by Naruto's sheer conviction, but Neji looked surprisingly thoughtful too.</p><p>"Either way," I said, hastily, because we didn't want to start this mission a team divided. "We have to investigate this. If you're right, then we should find some information to exonerate him and prove that he wasn't involved, right?"</p><p>We didn't need to be all on the same page about why we were looking, as long as we kept looking. Maybe it was even better to have a doubter involved, so we didn't interpret information in the light that we wanted to. That was a problem when you had your conclusion long before you found supporting evidence – you tended to try and shove puzzle pieces together to make them fit the picture you wanted.</p><p>"Or find he <em> did</em> ," Kiba muttered.</p><p>I hoped someone stood on his foot. I was too far away to do it myself.</p><p>Naruto held my gaze for a long second. I tried to look as calm and as serious and thoughtful as I could – it felt like sinking into mission mode, like gearing up for a fight.</p><p>"You're right," he agreed, almost grudgingly, before throwing himself into it. "Let's go and find out what <em> really</em> happened!"</p><p>Personally… I wasn't sure where I stood on the matter. On one hand, I didn't want Naruto to be wrong. On the other… well. It looked pretty likely.</p><p>I trusted Naruto but he wasn't exactly known for being observant.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"I can't tell you how ashamed I am that we did not guard those blueprints properly," the foreman of the construction company repeated for probably the third time. "I can never face Tsunade-sama again."</p><p>The construction foreman seemed very like a normally stable man reduced to a state of flustered shock. Given what had happened and how badly it was likely to reflect on him and his company, it was understandable. Also, it was highly likely that we weren't the first ninja to knocking on his door today – and I suspected that the others had been Anbu. That would make anyone flustered.</p><p>But, it wasn't actually our job to pass judgement on any of that. We were just here to <em> find</em> the missing blueprints.</p><p>"I need you to tell us everything that you know about Genno," Shikamaru said. "Where he came from, what he was doing here, everything."</p><p>"Well," the foreman said. "He came to the village about three months ago, with a letter of recommendation from a master carpenter in the Land of Wind. I'm sure you're aware that there's a bit of a construction boom in Konoha at the moment; every local carpenter has all the work he can handle. We desperately needed more skilled hands, so we took him on. He was an adequate carpenter. Nothing special. I didn't see any reason to offer him a permanent position, but like I said, we needed all the hands we could get. He took his job seriously, showed up on time, always did as he was told. After he was here for some time, I discovered that the letter he'd given me was a fake. I don't know if it'll do any good, but here it is."</p><p>Not exactly good news, but not unexpected either. We already knew he was an infiltrator.</p><p>"How'd you know it was a fake?" Naruto asked, puzzled, as Shikamaru looked over the offered letter.</p><p>"I was going over my records, and I found another record from the same carpenter. When I compared the two, I found that the handwriting didn't match." He shuffled through his papers, and frowned. "That's odd. I can't find it. To be honest," he admitted. "We didn't really care that the letter was a fake as long as he kept his nose out of trouble and did his work. Now I realise that that was a mistake. I never considered that the old man could be a shinobi."</p><p>And that, right there, was the number one problem with any security system. The weakest point was always, <em> always</em> the people involved. They'd let something slide, because it didn't seem important and then bam. Trouble.</p><p>"Do you have a list of the missing blueprints?" Shikamaru asked, moving away from that line of questioning. "Which of these sites did Genno work on?"</p><p>"None of them," the foreman said. "The structures on that list involve the safety of the village. An outside contractor would never be allowed to work on something so important, even if we are so shorthanded."</p><p>That at least was security conscious. Didn't make up for what had happened, but hopefully reduced the risk quite a bit.</p><p>Shikamaru sighed. "We still need to check these over and make sure he didn't slip inside to set traps anywhere or sabotage the construction. Neji, Hinata; we'll need your Byakugan for that. Take …" his eyes scanned over the group, selecting and discarding options, "Lee and Tenten with you."</p><p>Both Hyuuga gave curt, professional nods, and took half the list each.</p><p>"Yosh," Lee said, bouncing to his feet. "Hinata and I shall finish our half before you and Tenten, or I shall do five hundred chin ups!" He pointed a finger at Neji.</p><p>Neji ignored him. "Do not over exert yourself, Hinata-sama. Don't rush or … allow yourself to be rushed." The statement could have seemed harsh, especially given what I knew about their relationship, but it seemed more like well intentioned advice than censure.</p><p>"I will be thorough," she said quietly but with certainty.</p><p>Neji left the hall, Tenten shadowing him on his right.</p><p>Hinata stood gracefully and bowed slightly to the rest of us. "Lee," she said softly. "We should hurry if we want to finish before Neji-niisan."</p><p>Lee might have actually swept her off her feet in his rush to get going, but all I saw was a blur of green, so I couldn't actually say.</p><p>"Also, there's a chance that Genno was able to hide the plans before the Anbu cornered him," Shikamaru said, glancing towards Kiba and Shino.</p><p>Kiba smirked. "And you want us to think like thieves and figure out where, right? No problem, leave it to us. I'll have all his hiding places sniffed out before it's time for lunch."</p><p>"Alright. And Sasuke. I need you to liaise with the village patrols to see if you can work out what happened last night. No doubt the Anbu have already covered that angle, but it can't hurt." He cracked his neck. "Ino, you need to talk to the Hospital and see if they've learnt anything from the body."</p><p>Both of those were good choices – Sasuke had been working with the patrols recently, so he'd know who to talk to, and either Ino or I would be mostly likely to understand what the hell the medics were talking about.</p><p>"Shikako, I want you to go over the records here. Maybe see if you can find that other letter. Or whatever."</p><p>I nodded, wondered if Shikamaru was giving me the easiest, safest assignment and was abruptly angry with myself for even thinking that. He'd given everyone tasks they were suited to, and I couldn't argue that this wasn't well within my abilities. Who else was going to do it, Naruto?</p><p>Whatever was going on between us, whatever we were arguing about – this was a line I didn't want to cross. I wasn't going to bring this kind of ill feeling into a mission. I wasn't going to doubt legitimate orders just because I wasn't happy with the person giving them.</p><p>And it was Shikamaru. I still trusted him. I still thought he would have the best plan for dealing with all of this. How could I not?</p><p>"Naruto, Chouji and I will go and investigate his lodgings and talk to his co-workers. See if we can learn anything."</p><p>Everyone moved out.</p><p>I turned to the foreman, feeling calm and settled. I was on a mission. I knew what I had to do. "Do you have a record of Genno's work history? A list of the sites he was working on?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>"That's not a face that tells me you have good news."</p><p>I held up a hand, forcing Shikamaru to wait while I finished making notes. My hand was starting to cramp, and the entire page was filled with a list of tiny writing. "That's because," I said. "I really don't have good news."</p><p>He sighed. "We're updating the Hokage in five. Neji and Hinata are done, and Kiba and Shino admit that they're stumped."</p><p>I nodded, standing and stretching. "Find anything?"</p><p>He shook his head. "'suppose it's something," he said, hands in his pockets. "We didn't actually <em> want</em> the Hyuuga to find things."</p><p>It meant that Genno hadn't left any traps behind. Or, more pessimistically, he hadn't left them anywhere we could find.</p><p>Tsunade was waiting for us when we got to the tower, and we filed into her office. It was a little crowded, but we spread out in an arc around her desk.</p><p>"We conducted a background sweep on this guy, his place of residence and recent known locales," Shikamaru began without preamble. "The fact is he was remarkably unremarkable. He was an average carpenter; did his work, never stood out and never made any big mistakes. He didn't have any friends but didn't have any enemies either. He was the kind of person that if he disappeared one day, no one would miss him. He could just … fade away. His undercover technique was so good it ought to be in the shinobi textbooks."</p><p>I winced. That was not a promising opening.</p><p>"The only person who seemed to think he was something special was Naruto." Shikamaru jerked a thumb in his direction. "His apartment was empty, he wasn't involved in any clubs or groups, and the only places he ever seemed to go was out to eat. His entire stay here is a carefully constructed dead end."</p><p>"We also agree with that statement," Shino said. "Why? Because even Kiba and I were not able to find any trail more recent than twenty four hours old. Unless he maintained a frequently visited hideout inside Konoha, we are unlikely to be able to retrace his last steps."</p><p>"Yeah," Kiba agreed, frowning. "I can find you every place he visited in the past week, but sometime yesterday the trail just stops cold. I don't know what kind of scent blocking technique he used, but it's good. I couldn't even find the scent of things he was wearing and carrying. Usually people pick up the scent of things they interact with and you can track those for a bit, but I got nothing."</p><p>Tsunade nodded, but looked a little grim. Fair enough, those were the two best ways to go about finding an imposter and both had turned up nothing.</p><p>"In contrast," Neji said. "I can report that the structures that Hinata-sama and I examined were not trapped or tampered with in any way." Beside him, Tenten sighed in apparent relief, though she clearly already knew that.</p><p>"I've got a general timeline of events from the on duty guards and patrol units," Sasuke said. "Between the initial alert, and the explosion detonating, there's a gap of two and a half hours, which is when we presume Genno hid or exchanged the plans."</p><p>I made eye contact with Ino, asking if she wanted to go first or I should. She looked reluctant, and tilted her head slightly to the side.</p><p><em> Me, then.</em></p><p>I took a deep breath. "Bad news," I said, apologetically. "Those blueprints aren't the only items missing."</p><p>There were several hissed breaths.</p><p>"The letter that the foreman mentioned is gone, as well as a variety of other plans and documents. Nothing as crucial as the blueprints, of course, but some of its still sensitive information. There's a whole sweep – accounts, supply order forms, employee records, a copy of Konoha's building codes… it's all very random. I suspect that it's mostly a smokescreen to hide a few specific documents, but what they are, I can't tell."</p><p>I held out the pad with all my notes on it.</p><p>"I cross referenced with all the jobs that Genno was known to have worked on, or people he was known to have worked with. There are a few hits, including the Academy upgrades and for lack of a better option, I'd suggest starting there."</p><p>Tsunade took the pad and skimmed it closely. There were a lot of documents. Mostly it just seemed like Genno had grabbed handfuls of things at random, which was why I assumed it was a cover for whatever it was he didn't want us to know he was after.</p><p>"I have worse news," Ino said, holding out a hospital report. "The body that the Anbu brought in… isn't Genno."</p><p>And I thought that <em> I</em> had dropped a bomb. No wonder Ino looked reluctant.</p><p>"It was badly burnt," she said. "But initial autopsy is consistent with a man of between ages twenty five to thirty, not sixty to seventy, who lived a life of low physical exertion. So not a labourer or shinobi, in other words. Also, he was most likely to have been dead in excess of twenty four hours before he was brought in. So he would have died before the explosion anyway."</p><p>"So he's still alive?!" Naruto exclaimed, sounding less distressed than probably everyone else in the room was feeling.</p><p>"The Anbu didn't notice that?" Kiba asked. "Seems like a hard thing to sneak past them."</p><p>"They would have been a fair distance away to avoid the explosion," Tenten said. "So there was probably a short period of time where Genno was able to make a switch. But that means…"</p><p>"It was a trap," I finished. Of course it was. If this guy was good enough to lose the Anbu in the middle of a chase, then he could easily have drawn them to a predetermined location rigged with the things he needed.</p><p>"It did seem strange that a guy that good would be caught by the Anbu in the first place," Shikamaru acknowledged. "So that means our mission is even more time sensitive. He could be retrieving those plans right now."</p><p>So even if they weren't in the hands of the enemy, they could be very, very shortly.</p><p>"The perimeter guards are still on high alert," Tsunade said. "But I'll raise it another level. No one gets in or out without inspection. If those plans are still inside the village, they won't be able to get out."</p><p>It was a big if, and we knew it. But if we couldn't track him inside Konoha, how the hell were we going to track him outside it? He could have gone anywhere.</p><p>"Alright," Shikamaru decided. "Team Eight, Team Ten, you're with me. We'll go and check out the explosion site, see if there are any clues as to how he pulled this off. The rest of you will start on Shikako's list."</p><p>We filed out of Tsunade's office. I noticed that Shikamaru hadn't specified who was in charge of our team, which technically meant Naruto was – being the only Chunin in the group. But Naruto was slightly… emotionally compromised.</p><p>I met Sasuke's eyes. This could be awkward. Just our team, and we'd work together the same way we usually did. But the addition of Team Gai made things different.</p><p>"The Academy is probably the priority," I said softly, working to present the information in such a way that everyone would agree on a tactic. "Not only is it a site that Genno actually worked on, the repair list and specifications that are missing are only slightly less sensitive than a full blueprint. And… it's the Academy." I gave a helpless shrug. According to the foreman's security protocols, Genno really shouldn't have been working on it. He had only been included in minor repairs of training halls, and only because they were busy and he had never caused any trouble.</p><p>Still.</p><p>It was the Academy. All those kids…</p><p>"I agree," Neji said. "An attack upon the Academy could be devastating. And given the volume of people that pass through it every day, any traps are almost certain to be triggered accidentally. It would be prudent to eliminate such a possibility before spreading our attention."</p><p>We exited the tower and turned to head towards the Academy. We were walking quickly, but not running. At this point, it would only needlessly tire us with no benefit.</p><p>"Hyuuga has a point," Sasuke said grudgingly. It wasn't completely hostile, but it was close.</p><p>I bumped his shoulder with mine in remonstration. I was about to continue with a vague outline of a plan, when someone shouting Naruto's name caught our attention.</p><p>"Ehe, I'm on a mission right now, Ayame-nee," Naruto said sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. "I can't come and eat right now." He looked longingly at the restaurant.</p><p>The Ichiraku waitress ducked out of the stall. "Oh, is that so?" She said. "Okay then. We'll look after the note that Genno left you until you're finished."</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>"Eh?" Naruto asked, surprised. "He left me a note?"</p><p>"Yesterday," she confirmed. "After you left. He said it was part of your surprise! I was a little worried that you weren't going to come by today and see it. You seemed so excited about it yesterday." Her face crinkled into a happy smile.</p><p>She had no idea the kind of news that she was bearing, or the importance of it.</p><p>"Take it," Sasuke directed after a momentary pause. "We can spare five minutes." It was a bit of a weak redirect for how intensely focused we all were in this conversation, but Ayame didn't appear to notice.</p><p>"I don't believe it," Tenten hissed as Naruto went into the stall to get it. "A <em> note?</em> What kind of trap is this?"</p><p>"We'll have to see," I said, reluctantly. Because there was no way that Naruto <em> wasn't</em> going to try and see whatever the note was about. What had Genno said yesterday? Why hadn't I been paying more attention? Something about a treasure hunt? No, hadn't Naruto said that?</p><p>It probably looked really strange for six ninja to be huddling over a piece of paper in the middle of a street, but then again, this was Konoha. It probably wasn't that strange.</p><p><strong> It's time to start your search for treasure! </strong></p><p><strong> The hunt begins at your leisure.</strong></p><p><strong> Be quick of mind and sharp of eyes,</strong></p><p><strong> And answer the riddles to find your prize.</strong></p><p><strong> Find the next clue near deep water,</strong></p><p><strong> Man walks over, man walks under, </strong></p><p><strong> Footsteps echo with a clatter, </strong></p><p><strong> in times of war it burns asunder</strong></p><p>Really.</p><p>No. Really.</p><p>I wasn't the only one that looked completely baffled.</p><p>"Eh?" Naruto asked. "What does it mean?"</p><p>"It's a trap," Tenten repeated. "He's trying to lure you somewhere."</p><p>"I told you," Naruto said mulishly, jaw setting with stubbornness. "Genno is my friend. He wouldn't do this. This whole thing is a big misunderstanding.</p><p>I bit my lip and considered our options. As far as leads went this was probably the best we had. Yes, it was probably a trap but…</p><p>"The easiest way to find out would be to spring the trap," I pointed out. "Follow the riddles to the final location. It's risky, but…"</p><p>It was risky. To spring a trap without getting caught in it was tricky at the best of times. If Genno was a trap master, then he would also know how to deal with people who thought they could get around his traps.</p><p>"Yes!" Lee agreed enthusiastically. "This is a splendid plan. I shall go with Naruto, and we will be prepared for any surprises me might encounter along the way."</p><p>"No," Sasuke said cutting him off. I thought he was vetoing the whole plan, but he continued. "Tenten and I will go with him. You three continue on to the Academy."</p><p>That… yeah, that was a better combination of people. Lee and Naruto together would just play off each other and get more and more energised. Sasuke and Tenten had better heads on their shoulders.</p><p>Maybe we could have split up into Team 7 and Team Gai, but I had been the one to find all the missing documents, so I was the one who knew the most about that arm of our mission. Even if I was a little disappointed to be missing out on the more interesting part. Really. Riddles.</p><p>"Alright," I agreed. "Good luck."</p><p>"Finally!" Naruto exclaimed. "… so what's the answer to the riddle?"</p><p>"A bridge," I said, maybe a little impatient. That still left a lot of locations. Although… "Did you tell Genno about our training grounds?" Because there was a little red bridge there that we met on, sometimes. It was a personalised location, and reasonably isolated. If no one was specifically looking for it, chances were anything there wouldn't have been seen yet. "Otherwise probably one of the main Nakano crossings."</p><p>"Yeah, a bit," Naruto agreed. "Let's go check it out."</p><p>Lee looked a little disappointed, but not particularly upset about being turned down, or that Sasuke had just taken charge. That was good.</p><p>"Do you know which parts of the Academy Genno was working on?" Neji asked as we started walking again. "It will be helpful to know where to focus."</p><p>"Unfortunately no," I said, because he was right. If he had to go over things inch-by-inch, then having target locations would help. And it would be mostly Neji doing it. The Byakugan was invaluable here. "All those documents were missing. I'm hoping that the Academy records will have a copy, or at least specifics of what was repaired so we can narrow it down."</p><p>Unfortunately for us, the Academy office was staffed by a single middle aged Genin with a broken arm, who fully admitted he had been there all of a week and had no idea where any such records were kept. We could look ourselves, but without some kind of clue, we had no idea where to start either.</p><p>It would take more time to try and locate a specific file, than it would to simply begin our search. We could look for the paper later, if we still needed it then.</p><p>We started on the roof and worked our way downwards. Lee and I did physical sweeps while Neji activated his Byakugan and scanned everything that way. I wondered if he was starting to get tired – he'd clearly been using it all day to check the last list of construction sites – but he was probably well aware of his own limits.</p><p>We got as far down as Training Hall B – the same one that Lee and Sasuke had used to fight before the Chunin Exams – before we spotted anything strange.</p><p>"That's new," I said, referring to the wooden target post dominating one wall.</p><p>It was also slightly unusual. Training logs like that normally went outside, where stray kunai wouldn't damage the walls, and you had more room to move freely around it. An inside post might be good for when the weather was nasty, but a single one wouldn't do much for a class of thirty.</p><p>It seemed a little strange.</p><p>I dropped down off the balcony to inspect it closer. It had a circular target painted on it, but didn't actually seem to be different from any other training log I'd ever seen.</p><p>"Wait! Don't touch it!" Neji ordered sharply, staring at it with his Byakugan.</p><p>I stepped back. "Have you found something?"</p><p>"Yes," he said grimly. "It has an explosive note beneath it."</p><p>"That," I said. "Is not good." Still… beneath it? That was odd. "Is it pressure activated? Or…"</p><p>"The bulls eye of the target is the trigger, I believe," Neji said. "But there is another fuse leading away from it. I think…"</p><p>"What is it, Neji?" Lee asked, confused, after his teammate faded into silence.</p><p>Neji was looking for something, that much was clear. It was a little creepy, actually, how his irises were moving but you could <em> tell</em> that he wasn't looking in the direction he seemed to be looking in. Three sixty degree vision was undoubtedly handy, but… it was weird.</p><p>"There are at least four more explosive notes within the exterior walls of the Academy," Neji confirmed. "And there are more fuses leading out of my range. They're all connected to the same trigger."</p><p>I ran a hand through my hair. Oh, that was not good. That could <em> flatten</em> the Academy. And, you know, the Academy? Was full of people. Kids.</p><p>Shit. What were we going to do? I could feel the creeping of panic starting to set in. The situation had been serious before this, but it hadn't been so immediate. Missing blueprints were a long term problem. This could be bad, <em> right now.</em></p><p>"Someone needs to inform the Hokage," I decided. "I'll go. Maybe Lee could find Shikamaru and tell him what we've found?"</p><p>Neji nodded. "I will locate the rest of the explosives."</p><p>I jumped away and made a beeline for the Hokage's office.</p><p>Tsunade-sama took the new information in stride, which was incredibly relieving. There was something to be said for operating inside the village and being able to get orders quickly.</p><p>"Issue an order to evacuate," she said, quickly writing down a proclamation and stamping it. "Get the kids out, and then we can send in some experienced trap breakers to clear the tags out. Don't try and remove them on your own, but keep an eye on the trigger. Get both Hyuuga working out where any more tags might be."</p><p>"Yes, Hokage-sama," I said, taking the scroll quickly.</p><p>I jumped back to the Academy, glad it wasn't far away, and found Neji standing outside, near the road. He didn't look happy.</p><p>"No good news?" I guessed.</p><p>"No," he agreed. "It appears that the fuse branches in several directions, leading out into the village."</p><p>I pursed my lips and considered. "Well, Hinata will be here soon, so we can get the two of you following that. Do you have an estimate of how many there are?"</p><p>"I have seen the fuse branch six times. That would be the minimum. If it continues to branch further, as I suspect, then there could be dozens," Neji said. "Hundreds, even."</p><p>And wasn't that a terrifying thought. Even worse than knowing what was behind us.</p><p>"Let's not borrow trouble just yet," I said. "I'll get the evacuation started." I hesitated, an idea springing on me. "Are there any Hyuuga currently at the Academy?" It wasn't totally unprecedented to drag more ninja into a mission as the situation called for it, and I figured this probably called for it.</p><p>I could see Neji following my train of thought. "Yes, several of them. Hanabi would be capable of assisting us. Sumiko, as well. The others might not have the focus necessary to identify the hidden notes."</p><p>"Okay, I'll see if I can pull them out of class to help." It wasn't exactly one hundred percent fantastic to get Academy students messed up in this – and I knew Hanabi was only Konohamaru's age – but at the same time, the Byakugan was our best bet at finding these things, and who knew how many actual ninja Hyuuga were in the village.</p><p>We designated the Training Hall as our meeting place so we could keep an eye on the trigger and I headed inside to start the evacuation process.</p><p>It might not have technically have been to procedure, but the first room I knocked on was Iruka-sensei's.</p><p>"Shikako," he said, blinking at me in surprise. "Can I help you?"</p><p>"Sorry to interrupt," I said, smiling as blandly as I could. "I need to borrow Hanabi Hyuuga for the day. Also, I have a message from the Hokage."</p><p>Iruka-sensei took the scroll and read it. Then his eyes jumped to mine, faintly alarmed.</p><p>I doggedly held that bland smile in place. Nothing to see here folks. No reason to panic.</p><p>Iruka-sensei knew damn well that 'random' evacuations of the Academy didn't really just happen. At the same time, he also knew that freaking the students out was not going to benefit anyway.</p><p>"Alright, kids," he said, giving me back the notice. "We have an evacuation drill. Everyone pack up your things. Hanabi, you're excused. Please go with Shikako."</p><p>I waited until she had efficiently tucked her books and pens away, and came down to meet me.</p><p>"Go to Training Hall B," I said. "Neji will be there to give you further instructions."</p><p>I repeated the process to get Sumiko, who was a branch house member that was thankfully in the graduating class so I didn't have to worry about dragging <em> two</em> little kids into this mess. Okay, she was still eleven, but it was closer.</p><p>Then I raced around and presented the evacuation orders to the rest of the classrooms.</p><p>By the time I got back to the training hall, the Academy was rife with the low murmur of people moving. It sounded steady and practiced, and I knew that it was well drilled into them. We'd done evacuation drills at least once a term, and these kids would have already taken part in a <em> real</em> evacuation during the Exams.</p><p>Lee had returned with Team Eight and Team Ten, and I dropped from the balcony to land lightly beside Ino.</p><p>"Progress?" I asked quietly.</p><p>She shook her head. "We found how he escaped and fooled the Anbu, but that's about it."</p><p>I kinda wanted to know the explanation behind that, but I could wait till later, it if wasn't crucial.</p><p>Neji had clearly filled Shikamaru in on the developments from our half of the team. He looked grim.</p><p>"Locating these exploding tags is clearly important, but we can't forget that Genno is still out there with all of the papers. If we operate on the assumption that Genno was the one to plant all the tags, then there <em> might</em> be clues. At this stage, we really need that kind of lucky break." He looked over the group. "Shino, go with Sumiko. Kiba, with Hanabi. Ino and Lee can go with Hinata and Neji. Be thorough, but try not to attract too much attention; we don't know if he's watching us. We don't want him getting the bright idea to set these tags off anyway."</p><p>He'd put our better trackers with the younger Hyuuga, clearly in hopes that they'd pick up anything that the pre-Genin missed. Unfortunately, that left the best remaining trackers as Ino and <em> me.</em> Not great.</p><p>Everyone accepted their assignments with firm nods.</p><p>"I did not mention this before," Neji said. "But underneath the training post, there is more than an explosive note. There is also a scroll. I do not know what it says, but it could be important."</p><p>Shikamaru sighed and shoved his hands into his pockets. "Great. We'll work out how to get that out too."</p><p>"Do we have any leads?" I asked, as they filed out, leaving Shikamaru, Chouji and I behind. Chouji was snacking away on a bag of chips, and I took an offered handful because yes, it was getting late and I was hungry.</p><p>Shikamaru shook his head. "Not unless Naruto's team finds something." He huffed in exasperation. "Was it really the best plan to send them?"</p><p>I shrugged. "Not the worst," I said. "And Naruto is pretty damn stubborn when he wants to do something. I could have cajoled him, but the instant we hit another roadblock like this? He would have switched right back to wanting to go."</p><p>At least this way Sasuke could direct him a little. The two of them would bicker like anything, but they'd work together. And as far as 'spring the trap' teams went, well, Naruto was unpredictable. Not so observant, but that was what Sasuke was for.</p><p>"Do you think it's strange?" I asked, frowning at the training log.</p><p>Shikamaru glanced at me sideways. "The trigger?" he clarified.</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed. The fact that he'd pointed out the exact thing I was thinking meant we were on the same track. "It's so… haphazard. Someone has to hit the bulls eye to set it off. It would be totally random as to when that would occur. It might not happen for weeks. It might happen right away. It's a weird thing to leave to chance like that."</p><p>"Maybe he left instructions for someone to set it off?" Chouji volunteered. "After he was gone and everything."</p><p>"Maybe," I said, doubtfully. Then paused. Reconsidered. "Neji said there was a scroll under there." If Genno had set Naruto up to trigger the trap…</p><p>That was so far beyond awful that I couldn't even wrap my mind around it.</p><p>"You think…" Shikamaru trailed off. "Troublesome. Okay, let's get it out."</p><p>It was a little nerve wracking to try and disarm the trap. We didn't really disable it entirely – I didn't know if there were backups or fail safes and I didn't want to find out by setting them off – just raised it off the base high enough for Shikamaru to slip a Shadow Stitching tendril in and hook out the scroll.</p><p>Without touching the explosive note that was also in there.</p><p>"Troublesome," he repeated.</p><p>I unrolled the scroll on the floor.</p><p><strong> Can weather even the mightiest blow,</strong></p><p><strong> And will crumble only to river flow?</strong></p><p>I sat back. "That's… short." And much less helpful than the clue that Naruto had picked up at Ichiraku.</p><p>The answer was stone, clearly. Strong, but eroded by water? But which stone and where? I flipped the paper over, half hoping there was more written on the back, but there wasn't.</p><p>"At least we know it was definitely Genno," Shikamaru said, leaning back.</p><p>"We weren't really doubting that," I countered, frustrated.</p><p>Maybe if Sasuke and Naruto followed the trail here, then they would have more clues.</p><p>Instead we marked out a floor plan of the Academy and drew in the locations Neji had indicated the tags were for the trap removers. Then I went to the office to start looking for the Academy copy of the records. At this stage, it probably didn't help us much, given that we'd <em> found</em> the traps, but at least we'd have a copy for the records if we didn't manage to get the plans back.</p><p>When I felt Naruto getting close, I regrouped in the Training Hall. The log had been removed; clearly disabled. If I concentrated, I could feel two people moving around the outside of the Academy – that had to be the team Tsunade had sent. They even seemed familiar…</p><p><em> Koharu and Homura?</em> My eyebrows shot up. But I supposed that you couldn't doubt their skill. As far as finding people on short notice to do extremely complicated work went, that was a neat solution.</p><p>But it was also no wonder that Shikamaru looked slightly cranky.</p><p>They were not his favourite people.</p><p>"No way!" Naruto exclaimed. "You guys beat us here."</p><p>"Idiot," Sasuke grunted. "You knew they were coming here. <em> We</em> were supposed to come here."</p><p>"Not Shikamaru," Naruto retorted, and okay, he was kinda right. "Hey, where is everyone else?"</p><p>"Out looking," Shikamaru said. "Tell me what you found."</p><p>Tenten groaned. "Riddles and more riddles. Not a single trap, either."</p><p>"Yeah, there were lots of super hard riddles," Naruto exclaimed, waving his hands and dropping a whole bunch of scrolls on the ground. "But we got them, and hey, one was even in my apartment and that wasn't there this morning because I totally would have seen that."</p><p>Sasuke interrupted him. "The last riddle is in three sections," he said, crouching to lay two scrolls flat on the ground. "The last one is here at the Academy somewhere."</p><p>Mutely, I retrieved the scroll we'd found. That made sense, if it was part of a set. On its own, it wasn't very descriptive.</p><p><strong> Find the truth in parts of three,</strong></p><p><strong> Here, your home, the Academy,</strong></p><p><strong> Find them all and find the plans, </strong></p><p><strong> They'll be safe when in your hands</strong></p><p><strong> What has roots that no one sees,</strong></p><p><strong> touches sky and kisses breeze,</strong></p><p><strong> Upon its side has faces five</strong></p><p><strong> But does not grow, is not alive</strong></p><p><strong> Can weather even the mightiest blow,</strong></p><p><strong> And will crumble only to river flow?</strong></p><p>"We were pretty sure that it was referring to the mountain, even without the last part," Sasuke said. "But we figured that we – Shikako?"</p><p>I felt all the blood drain from my face. "We evacuated the kids to the mountain," I said hoarsely, looking up to meet his eyes.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Trap Master Arc: Chapter 77</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: And that makes DOS three years old today, from its first posting on FFNet. Scary thought, isn't it?</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 77</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> When we were young and brave</p><p>We fought to save the one thing that we loved</p><p>We took a sacred vow</p><p>And signed our names in blood</em></p><p><em> And through it all, we kept on shining</em></p><p><em> We fought the doubt and faced the pain</em></p><p><em> We built it up from dust and ashes</em></p><p><em> To cheat the odds and rise again</em></p><p><em> ~Lynyrd Skynyrd; Through It All</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I flew out the doors of the training hall.</p><p>There was shouting behind me, but I ignored it, dropping my training weight seals, and leaping upwards. I hit the side of the Academy, bounced to the roof, angled myself towards the mountain and <em> pulled.</em></p><p>The world around me hazed with the lines of body flicker, and I dropped out of it in full sprint.</p><p>One step. Two.</p><p>And Sasuke was beside me with the whooshing of air that suggested he'd used a body flicker of his own.</p><p>"Slow down," he said lowly. "They can't keep up."</p><p>I grimaced, aware that Naruto couldn't match either of us for speed. Yet my feet didn't slow.</p><p>We had evacuated the kids to the mountain. We'd sent them there. And it wasn't safe at all.</p><p>One step. Two. My toes brushed the edge of the roof and I <em> pulled</em> , open air the only thing beneath me as I barrelled, uncontrolled, to the mountain.</p><p>I felt… compelled. Driven. We had to fix this before it became a disaster.</p><p>"Hey wait up!" Naruto's voice drifted faintly after us. "Ah! Summoning Jutsu!"</p><p>He sailed over our heads, riding on the back of a toad bigger than he was.</p><p>"Or that works," Sasuke conceded, matching me stride for stride. We hit the stairs, taking them four-five at a time, flying more than we were running.</p><p>Naruto was waiting for us, sliding off the back of his ride and peering into the dark tunnels of the mountain.</p><p>"Which way do we go?" He asked, an anxious curl twisting the corners of his eyes.</p><p>"Send out clones," I said. My breathing was a little too harsh, I'd pushed too hard. It didn't matter. "Lots of them. Tell the teachers that the evacuation drill is over."</p><p>They could probably return to the Academy if the tags had been deactivated. Better than telling them to go elsewhere and finding that that was just as dangerous.</p><p>"Start a branching search pattern," Sasuke added, hard on the heels of my comment. "Split a new clone at every intersection. We need to find Genno."</p><p>Naruto nodded, face set with concentration, and clapped his hands together. Orange spilled into the mountain, each and every face just as determined.</p><p>I could still feel the clock ticking.</p><p><em> If he knew- if he knew we knew- how long do we have- if he knows-</em></p><p>I closed my eyes, ignoring the pounding of my heart and whirling of my mind and tried to <em> feel.</em> Where was he?</p><p>There were too many-</p><p>I couldn't-</p><p>Naruto was like a river of light, blanking out everything around him. There was the low humming of a hundred children, all packed together. There was the village behind us, the familiar shapes of Shikamaru and Chouji almost out of reach. There were blurry smudges in the mountain, and oh, of <em> course</em> there were defences against sensors.</p><p>The muscles in my neck bunched and strained with tension. I wanted to shout. I wanted to stamp my feet.</p><p>I <em> couldn't find him.</em></p><p>"The weakest points are going to be the places that people have to access frequently," Sasuke said bluntly, staring at the mountain with steely eyes. "Archive Library. The main entrances. The-"</p><p>"The construction," I said, words spilling out before I'd consciously put the information together. It seemed like my brain was being cut out of the decision making process, left quivering in the corner like the useless lump of flesh it was. I turned sideways and stared up at the half completed face of the Fifth Hokage. My lips pulled back over my teeth, annoyance at missing the <em> blinding fucking obvious.</em></p><p>We dashed up the side of the mountain, feet sticking easily to the rock. Sasuke took point, eyes spinning Sharingan red to search for traps. There was nothing, and we landed lightly on the scaffolds set up around the sculpture.</p><p>"Where's the entrance?" Naruto asked, bouncing around the small working area. The wooden planks bounced underfoot as he went. "There has to be one, right?"</p><p>There was, probably. Somewhere for the workers to get out here, if they weren't ninja. Somewhere to store tools, to take a break.</p><p>I pressed my hand flat against the stone. It was hard and gritty, rough beneath my palms.</p><p>Everything I could sense was blurry, like looking through a frosted glass door. But less so here than it had been further along the path, rough and unfinished. The construction did nothing for the security of the things behind it. It wasn't much, but it was the difference between being able to tell 'someone' from 'nothing'…</p><p>"We've got an entrance," I said, and held my hands out towards the two of them.</p><p>We didn't have time to waste.</p><p>Sasuke hesitated a half beat of a second, eyes searching mine for assurance that I <em> could</em> do this. Then he stepped in close, arm wrapping like a steel band around my waist. I pulled Naruto in close and <em> slammed</em> us into the rock.</p><p>It was like fighting – an end and goal in sight and knowledge of how to get there, but needing the strength and will to do it. The stone was hard and unyielding, bitter and rough, clamping down around me when I needed it to give. It was a struggle. Not only was the stone so hard and difficult to move through, I was trying to drag two extra people with me. I'd never done that before.</p><p>By the time we surged out the other side, my lungs were working like bellows, trying to draw in oxygen. I was dizzy and sweating. My chakra levels had once again dropped to an almost alarming low.</p><p><em> Fast, yes. Efficient, not really.</em> And the Earth Walking jutsu probably didn't do anything good for the integrity of the rock. Well, whatever. We were inside now.</p><p>"Genno!" Naruto exclaimed, pointing at the man waiting for us.</p><p>He spun around. "Ah, Konoha's number one most unpredictable ninja indeed! I led you here every step of the way, yet you still surprised me by finding another entrance." He eyed the wall behind us, which didn't, in any way imaginable, qualify as an 'entrance'.</p><p>Sasuke shifted his grip on me, lowering me so I could kneel instead of letting me simply collapse.</p><p>I wasn't done, not by a long shot, not really. But we didn't lose anything by letting Genno think I was. I tucked my chin close to my chest, peering at him only from beneath the fringe of my hair.</p><p>"Old man, you've gotta tell me that this is all a bit mistake," Naruto pleaded. "You didn't take those blueprints or set all those traps, right?"</p><p>I surreptitiously glanced around the room – cave? It was all hewn stone, did that count? – and made note of what I could see. There was a tripline trap on the entrance, a set of scattered tool boxes and a battered old trunk sealed with three explosive notes near the outer wall. There was a suspicious looking depression on the ground about a meter in front of Genno, like stone had been carved away. Maybe some kind of pressure activated trap, or maybe there was something buried there.</p><p><em> Be careful, be careful.</em> We'd sprung the trap. Now we needed to survive it.</p><p>"Oho, so you found all my traps as well, did you?" Genno smiled. "You've surprised me again."</p><p>Naruto looked devastated.</p><p>"But why?" he demanded.</p><p>"I suppose you've never heard of the Kagero Village," Genno said thoughtfully.</p><p>My shadow was starting to creep along the walls. I didn't have the chakra to stretch it far, or hold it for long, but if he was distracted, then maybe he wouldn't notice it and I would be able to connect.</p><p>"I have, actually," I said, voice rough. "It was a small town in the Land of Mountains. It wasn't a Hidden Village, but it was home to at least one clan of shinobi and was considered close to one. It was destroyed sometime during the Second War."</p><p>Those kind of mid-way villages didn't really exist anymore. There were clans out there, certainly, ones that had decided against joining a Hidden Village, though even those were a dying breed. But as far as villages went, you were either a Hidden Village, or you had nothing to do with shinobi.</p><p>"That is correct," Genno mused. "It was nearly thirty years ago now. Our villages were at war with each other, you know. Or rather, we were on opposite sides of the war. I don't imagine my home was large enough to <em> truly</em> bother the Hidden Leaf. For good reason – one night, our ninja were lured out with a false alarm, and we returned to find our village burning to the ground. There were very few survivors, and they unanimously told us that it was the work of Leaf shinobi."</p><p>He didn't sound angry. Just distanced and dispassionate.</p><p>"The leader of the attack was your very own Hokage," he added. "Tsunade of the Senju was a name to be feared, in those days. Tsunade the Mountain Crusher, they called her. She was like an avalanche, fierce and unstoppable."</p><p>Naruto's face was stricken.</p><p>Beside me, Sasuke shifted lightly on his feet. "And what does that have to do with anything?"</p><p>"We could hardly let that go, could we?" Genno said mildly. "I was dispatched with the most critical mission of my career – to make Hidden Leaf regret what they did. I took it gladly too, for my wife and son, who both perished in the fire and ruin. For three months, I wandered this village, infiltrating it, placing explosive tags at every corner. It was different then – you had less security, fewer Anbu in the village, once I made it inside I could almost do as I pleased. I was supposed to detonate the tags while the rest of our forces attacked from the outside. We would have crushed you."</p><p>"Thirty years ago," I said. Obviously it hadn't happened. But were those still the same tags <em> now?</em> Had they been sitting there, waiting, for <em> thirty goddamn years?</em></p><p>That was almost more horrifying than the rest of the story he was telling us.</p><p>"Yes. But it wasn't to be. While we were weak, we were attacked again, and this time there were no survivors. So my mission could never be completed."</p><p>"So why come back now, after all this time?" Naruto asked, aggrieved. His hands were clenching into fists at his side. "Is it just to fulfil your stupid mission?"</p><p>"Well," Genno replied. "It just seemed like such a <em> waste.</em> I thought they should be put to use."</p><p>My shadow crossed the last few inches, sneaking between two toolboxes and grounding itself on his shadow.</p><p>"Shadow Poss-" I began to say-</p><p>- And there was a sudden, blinding flash of light, so bright it was <em> hot,</em> searing straight into my eyes. I screamed, jerking backwards, arm flying up to cover my face. There had been no warning, no chance to turn away or protect myself.</p><p><em> Chakra activated trap,</em> I realised numbly. I'd set it off with my chakra, not Genno. He knew who we were and what we could do, obviously. He was ready for us.</p><p>I flung myself sideways on the ground, moving to avoid any possible counterattack that I could no longer see to avoid.</p><p>I could feel the rushing of air, and the clattering of metal, and knew that I had only narrowly escaped.</p><p>My eyes were watering, and when I opened them, everything was dim and blurry. Spots danced in front of me. I squeezed them shut again.</p><p>Someone slapped their hand against the floor. "Mother<em> fucker,</em> " Sasuke hissed.</p><p>Naruto staggered forward. "Genno!" he yelled. His chakra surged in a familiar pattern, ready to bring forth an army of clones.</p><p>Belatedly, I remembered the pressure plate. Would Naruto have noticed it? Would he remember to avoid it? The more people in the room, the more chance that someone would set the traps off.</p><p><em> Shit.</em></p><p>I threw a brace of kunai towards Genno, didn't wait for confirmation that they had hit or been deflected and moved sideways, clamping my hands over Naruto's and resisting his initial, instinctive move to throw me off. "Stop! You'll set off the traps!"</p><p>Sasuke was moving now, and I cracked my eyes open to watch him leap nimbly towards Genno, kunai in hand. His eyes were flat black, and there was a gleam of wetness on his cheeks, which indicated that Sharingan and flash bombs didn't mix.</p><p>Naruto stilled, and dropped his hands. "Crap," he said.</p><p>"Water Style; Water Bullet Jutsu," Sasuke said, shooting off a series of small, incredibly fast projectiles. Genno ducked and it wasn't until the first struck the wall behind him with a metallic clatter that I realised they weren't just water – like his Phoenix Flower Jutsu, they hid shuriken in their middles.</p><p>I was glad he hadn't used that one actually. Right now, light sounded like a bad idea.</p><p>"Oho, you're clever," Genno said approvingly, and launched a kunai not towards us, but the roof.</p><p>There was the slight wuffing of a spring releasing, a trap I hadn't even <em> seen,</em> and a set of weights were launched down, separating to reveal a net just in time to tangle dangerously around Sasuke, too fast to really be dodged at close range. If he'd had his Sharingan, he might have stood a chance, but he didn't.</p><p>He'd be okay, but he was also out of the fight for a few seconds.</p><p>Naruto leapt forward, thankfully over the pressure plate, and filled the gap that Sasuke had left. I circled around, attacking from the opposite side.</p><p>I was wary about trying Shadow Possession again, after last time.</p><p>"Are you serious?" Naruto cried. "You'd destroy this whole village just so everyone will know what you did 30 years ago?"</p><p>He landed an ugly uppercut to Genno's stomach that made the old man double over. I took the opening, with a snap kick to the back of his knees, and only narrowly missed with a knife hand strike to the back of his neck that would have made game over.</p><p>Genno coughed and pulled on something hidden in his sleeves. Thick purple smoke billowed out of his shirt, filling the room.</p><p>I held my breath, in case it was poison, and managed to hook my fingers into the back of Genno's jacket.</p><p>He rolled sideways, and I was pulled off balance, not anchored firmly enough to resist. My arm twisted and I had to let go.</p><p>There was a grinding sound, of a pressure plate depressing, and then Genno's chakra vanished with a replacement jutsu, leaving a log of wood to be tackled furiously by Naruto.</p><p>There was a heavy crash of stone, and the air inside the room seemed even heavier and more claustrophobic than before.</p><p>"Door's locked," Sasuke said tersely, having thrown off the trap. The smoke was thinning enough for me to see him, and I could make out the crumpled shape of his fuuma shuriken wedged underneath the stone slab blocking the entrance. He'd been fast enough to try and stop it closing, but not fast enough to escape.</p><p>"I'm going to Rasengan it," Naruto said, clenching his fists. "I can't believe him. That old man-"</p><p>"Wait!" I said, feeling like I was doing nothing but interrupting Naruto at every turn. "It'll be trapped. Use a clone."</p><p>"If Genno expected us to enter that way," Sasuke said, "the traps should be focused in the other direction."</p><p>I hoped so. But he'd got us good. He'd been one step ahead the entire way.</p><p>The door shattered under Naruto's Rasengan. The clone holding it dispelled almost instantly, though I couldn't tell if it had been hit by the shrapnel from the door, or from some other trap.</p><p>"Shadow clone jutsu!" Naruto cried, and sent a wave of clones down the hallway. The first exploded two steps down, and I ducked back, cringing.</p><p>"Well that's one way to do it," Sasuke said drolly.</p><p>It probably wasn't the <em> best</em> way. If there were exploding notes, or traps that did a lot of damage, or trip wires that set traps off somewhere <em> else</em> … then no, just setting everything off with an endless supply of disposable soldiers was not a great move.</p><p>But it would clear the hallway fast.</p><p>I felt like one of us should object out of habit, but Naruto was already charging into the chakra smoke.</p><p>I followed, falling into step with Sasuke.</p><p>The halls weren't well lit, but I could tell when we were getting closer to an exit by the lightning of the gloom. My eyes were aching, and I swiped at my cheeks to brush away the reflexive watering.</p><p>Stepping out into the sunlight was almost painful.</p><p>We were on the mountain plateau, overlooking the village from the tip of Tsunade's head. No wonder Genno had expected us to come from this direction – the door was close and obvious. If we'd bothered to look we would have found it in seconds.</p><p>I'd been expecting the rest of the team to be waiting for us. I'd been able to feel their chakra as we got closer to the exit – the muffling seals of the mountain doing their jobs well – and if they'd followed us, there was nowhere else that they were going to be.</p><p>Genno threw down another smoke bomb, but Tenten leapt high above it, soaring into the air and pulling out one of her weapons scrolls. A veritable rain of weapons pelted down, everything from kunai to kusarigama, a widespread scatter that was intended more to corner a target than aimed to kill. That was something interesting about Tenten – she was prized for her accuracy and she used that accuracy to <em> not </em> hit things.</p><p>Chouji's hands, partially expanded to be large as the rest of him was, clapped at the edge of the smoke cloud, catching the agile form of Genno between them as he tried to escape Tenten's barrage.</p><p>"So these are your friends, Naruto?" Genno asked, coughing slightly. "You work well together."</p><p>"Don't bother trying to distract us," Shikamaru drawled. "We've already disarmed the traps that you planted up here. You're finished, now."</p><p>"Oh, have you?" Genno asked, slyly as though he knew a secret. "This wasn't how I intended for this to go, I admit, but what a finale. It has been fun."</p><p>"Fun?!" Naruto shouted. He waved an arm out towards the village. "You call that <em> fun?</em> Hurting people and trying to blow things up? That's not <em> fun!</em> "</p><p>Genno chuckled dryly. "You have such a one track mind, my boy. Whoever said I wanted to blow them up? I merely said that I didn't want them to go to waste. A good trap can be put to use in other ways."</p><p>"What?" Naruto sounded confused.</p><p>"You didn't have even a little bit of fun?" Genno asked. "All my riddles, all the treasure for you to find… I have to admit, you exceeded all my expectations."</p><p>"No one was hurt," Sasuke said softly. He wasn't looking at Genno anymore. He was looking at Naruto.</p><p>Naruto who had insisted, all along, that Genno wasn't dangerous – right up until we'd caught him in the act. Who had been so betrayed.</p><p>"Well whatever your intention was," Shikamaru said, hands in his pockets. "You're still charged with the theft of important documents. I don't think there'll be any fun in your future for a very long while."</p><p>"There was a reason I came back now," Genno said. "I'm old, and sick. There is no fun in my future anyway. I had thought to claim my last piece of vengeance and put some old ghosts to rest…" he smiled. "But I think this was better in the end. It was just like old times. I think my son would be happier to know it ended like this."</p><p>"W-what?" Naruto stammered. "What are you saying, old man?"</p><p>"I came to Hidden Leaf with the intent of setting off all my traps. But then I met you, and you reminded me so strongly of my son," Genno said. "I just… didn't want to do it anymore. And there was no reason. Kagero village has been gone for years and when you get to my age, some wounds no longer bleed. Even the ones that you thought would last forever. So instead, I planned this treasure hunt for you, and turned my tags into part of the prize."</p><p>I let out a jagged breath, but didn't take my eyes off him. He seemed sincere, but I couldn't chase away the sharp spike of fear that had sent me racing away from the Academy.</p><p>No one had been hurt, that was true. But we'd spent a day fearing the absolute worst. There was a kind of damage in that.</p><p>No. It hadn't been fun. Maybe in time we'd be able to look back on it and laugh, but it hadn't been <em> fun.</em></p><p>"Uh, can we wrap this up?" Chouji said, a little awkwardly. Given that he was still holding onto Genno with giant hands, it was probably a good reminder. I actually had no idea how long Chouji could hold his Partial Expansion Jutsu for.</p><p>Shikamaru sighed. "You going to come quietly?" he asked, jerking his chin towards Genno.</p><p>Tenten idly flipped a set of kunai in her hands, which demonstrated the idea that he really <em> should</em> without actually saying anything.</p><p>"Very quietly," Genno said, with that same amused smile. "Don't mind me at all." He closed his eyes and sighed. "It's all over."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The Hokage's Office was crowded. Koharu and Homura hovered behind Tsunade's shoulders, much to her apparent annoyance, and the twelve of us packed ourselves in how we could.</p><p>Hanabi and Sumiko had been thanked and sent home with the rest of the Hyuuga that had been rounded up to assist on short notice, a grim faced collection that had gone over Konoha with a fine comb.</p><p>"Preposterous," Koharu sniffed, at the explanation of Genno's motives. "Likely another trap itself. Once you let down your guard he will strike again."</p><p>"That will be difficult," Tsunade said dryly. "I already have a report from the prison pronouncing him dead. With certainty, this time."</p><p>Naruto made a shocked, upset sound.</p><p>"Initial diagnosis is a suicide pill, but it might not have mattered. He was showing signs of late stage terminal illness, which might have been what he was referring to. Even with medical intervention, he was unlikely to survive much longer."</p><p>Reactions to that were mixed. Naruto looked like he was going to cry, and Hinata patted him softly on the arm, but others weren't quite so invested.</p><p>I couldn't help the little petty 'good' that I thought, even if I was immediately ashamed.</p><p>"The chest in the mountain storage room contained all the missing blueprints," Shikamaru said, taking the attention away from Naruto. "Including the previous letter of recommendation that was missing from the foreman's house. Without something to compare it to, it's hard to tell, but it's highly likely that the original is also a fake, and was what Genno used to infiltrate the village the first time around."</p><p>Tsunade nodded. "We began to suspect something of the sort when we began retrieving the explosive notes," she admitted. "The Academy was clearly a new target, but many of the notes scattered throughout the village are of an old style that aren't in use anymore. If they were planted so long ago, that explains why."</p><p>"Yeah, that's what I don't get," Kiba said. "How can all those explosive notes have just been sitting there for so long? Someone ought to have noticed them."</p><p>I agreed. I really, really agreed. In this village full of ninja, it was nearly unbelievable to think that no one had stumbled across a single one, and then followed the fuses, in thirty years. There were hundreds of ninja in the village. Large swathes of it had been destroyed through the years, with the Chunin Exam Invasion, the Kyuubi Attack… had no one noticed <em> then</em> either?</p><p>Or… maybe people had.</p><p>There were, if you considered with very cold logic, benefits to having a last resort trap wired into your own village, if you could be certain that only you controlled it.</p><p>It was maybe the sort of thing that would only occur to people who looked for worst case scenarios. The kind of people who thought 'if I can't have it, no one else can either'.</p><p>There was someone that sprang to mind, when I considered it. Who would have taken something like that, hidden it, and waited for the moment to use it.</p><p>Who was a person that I really would not have wanted to have an explosive trap wired into the walls of my home.</p><p>"On the contrary," Shino said to Kiba. "It is easy to miss something that no one is looking for. As well hidden as they were, they would never have been spotted unless someone was using Byakugan in the right spot."</p><p>"That's why we have random sweeps," I said. "Spot checks. Audits. Inspections. So that we find things we don't know we're looking for."</p><p>Then I shut my mouth, the niggling conclusion still bouncing around in my head. I had no proof. I was maybe being paranoid.</p><p>But.</p><p>Was it so improbable?</p><p>I dropped back, and let the rest of the debriefing flow over me. We'd managed to sum up the main points, anyway. The Academy was fine, and the students none the worse for wear for traipsing up the mountain and back. The explosive tags had all been retrieved. The plans had all been retrieved. Security plans were in action to cover all the newly revealed holes and flaws.</p><p>"Naruto, Shino, Ino, Shikako. Stay behind. The rest of you are dismissed," Tsunade said and waited till everyone shuffled out. Even the two Elders left with disapproving sniffs.</p><p>"Congratulations, Nara," she smirked at me briefly. "You get what you wanted. For the next week and a half, you're taking over from Anko on day shifts with Yakumo Kurama."</p><p>I blinked. I hadn't considered that something I'd asked for at all.</p><p>"Thank you?" I said tentatively.</p><p>It wasn't bad. I just. Hadn't asked for that? I mean, yes, I had asked about Yakumo… but I hadn't expected the results I'd got in the first place, let alone more. And that was a bit of a downgrade, wasn't it, from Special Jounin to Genin? Maybe Tsunade considered the worst of the danger past.</p><p>I didn't really understand what the Hokage was trying to do here.</p><p>"You three are assigned to Anko for a B-rank mission to the Land of Sea," Tsunade continued, turning to the other three. "She's currently on an exterior patrol for the emergency response, so your departure time is at her discretion. I suggest you be prepared."</p><p>Naruto looked like he wasn't really paying that much attention. Given that he was still upset about Genno, I could see why. But I wasn't really worried about him.</p><p>Ino nodded sharply. "Understood, Hokage-sama," she said.</p><p>This would be her first real mission since the Sound Four. Since Orochimaru. I hoped she was ready for it.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sealing Arc: Chapter 78</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: So I made a couple of AMV's for DOS in an attempt to kickstart some creativity. You can find the links in my profile, as always. Please be kind – I've never tried to vid anything before.</p><p>… And apparently that opened the floodgates. N. Hamilton has made an amazing Dreaming of Sunshine AMV. Thank you!</p><p>And as always, major thanks to Juno-nine and erimies for letting me bounce ideas off them and putting up with various half-finished scenes being flung in their direction for opinions.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 78</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Hello darkness, my old friend</p><p>I've come to talk with you again</p><p>Because a vision softly creeping</p><p>Left its seeds while I was sleeping</p><p>And the vision that was planted</p><p>In my brain still remains</p><p>Within the sound of silence</em></p><p><em> ~ Sounds of Silence; Simon and Garfunkel</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Anko didn't get back to the village till late, and arranged to meet me early the next morning for a briefing slash mission handover.</p><p>I wasn't exactly thrilled about that, but it was a mission, so I couldn't complain, could I?</p><p>The village was beautiful at sunrise – I could appreciate that – but it was also cold, and I strode along with my shoulders hunched and my hands shoved into my pockets.</p><p>The tower at this time of morning was almost eerily quiet – not deserted, but it lacked the normal bustle of activity. Everything seemed muted and dim; foreboding, like you weren't meant to be here at all.</p><p>But I was, so I lifted my shoulders, rolled them into a position of confidence, and pushed open the door. Inside, it was just as quiet, the bare bones of a night shift skeleton staff whiling away the hours. I nodded to the Chunin at the front desk, and wound my way through the corridors to the briefing room.</p><p>Naruto wasn't there yet and I wondered if I should have swung by his apartment to make sure he was awake. But Naruto had never been late to any of our team meetings, or had problems with early mornings, so I didn't really doubt that he'd get here.</p><p>"Morning," I greeted the rest of the team, voice quiet.</p><p>Ino smothered a yawn behind her hand. "Hey. I didn't realise you were coming to this meeting too."</p><p>I shrugged, turning to Anko.</p><p>"Saves time," the Special Jounin said, snapping the scroll she was reading closed with a sharp flick of her wrist. There was a small frown creasing her forehead, and she looked tired. Not just dawn-o'clock-wake-up-tired, but pulled-an-all-nighter-tired.</p><p>"Nara. You're taking over watching Yakumo until I get back. Lucky for you, you're already informed about the situation." She smirked, briefly. "It's classed as an escort mission, Level Three security restrictions."</p><p>Security levels started at Level One (Non-resident; No Access) to Level Two (Resident; Low Access) - which was what Konoha citizens were by default – to Level Three (Shinobi; Low Access) and up to, supposedly, Level Ten for the Hokage. In general promotions in rank went hand in hand with promotions in security clearance, though it was more of a correlation than a causation. You could have one without the other. Clan shinobi tended to rank up faster than first generation ninja, as a simple matter of fact, which might not have been fair but was what it was.</p><p>Level Three was Academy students and Genin, mostly. Which was interesting, because it treated Yakumo like a reasonably trusted member of the village. I <em> might</em> have been a Level Four, depending on paperwork, though Tsunade was being pretty lenient with us at the moment in regards to what we were supposed to know.</p><p>"No house arrest?" I asked curiously.</p><p>"That's been lifted," Anko said, bracing a hand against the side of her neck and cracking it. "There've been no repeat incidents, but if there are, you're authorised to use all necessary force." She pulled a scroll and set of notes out of her pocket. "These are the chakra restriction seals that have proven to be effective on her transformation. They should be your first resort."</p><p>I took them and nodded crisply. I didn't want to hurt Yakumo. That was the last thing I wanted.</p><p>Also? Chakra restriction seals? Sounded pretty damn amazing and I was thrilled to be able to have a look at them. How did they work? How strong were they? Would they be able to, say, stop a Jinchuriki from transforming? Maybe not, but Jiraiya had made seals that could do that; were these the same type of thing?</p><p>Getting my hands on these was worth a week and a half of downtime, no question.</p><p>"Your shift ends at curfew, after which Yakumo will remain inside. Night time monitoring is handled separately. Unkai has raised the possibility of her moving back to a less isolated part of the compound, so you might have to liaise with him about that."</p><p>I nodded, accepting the information. It all sounded fairly straight forward, really.</p><p>Any further questions I had were cut off as Naruto burst through the door, unrestrained and energetic despite the hour. "Good morning!" He hollered cheerfully.</p><p>Ino sighed, chin dropping into her palm. "Not so loud," she admonished.</p><p>Anko smirked. "Well someone is enthusiastic," she said. "I guess that's something." She caught my eye and tilted her head towards the door. "We can start the mission debriefing now."</p><p>That was my cue to leave, obviously.</p><p>I glanced over at Ino. I wanted –</p><p>I wanted to tell Naruto to look out for her. I wanted to tell Ino to look out for him. I wanted to tell Shino to look out for them both. To make sure that they would be okay.</p><p>I didn't. That would have been so insulting. They all knew to do that anyway. They all would. And… they could look out for themselves. They weren't helpless, not now, not ever.</p><p>They didn't need me trying to interfere to protect them.</p><p>The thought made something weigh heavy inside my chest, press up against the backs of my eyes. I blinked, swallowed, and pushed it away and down so quickly it barely had time to register.</p><p>"Good luck with your mission," I said, the rasp to my voice no worse than usual.</p><p><em> Sheesh</em> , what had that been about?</p><p><hr /></p><p>I went home for breakfast because it was still well before I had to go to Yakumo. I was a little annoyed that I'd had to get up so early when it wasn't really necessary, actually, because that debriefing had taken all of about ten minutes.</p><p>"A mission, already?" Mum said, with a sniff of disapproval. "You'd think they'd give you some down time after rushing around all yesterday."</p><p>"It's only an in-village escort," I said. "It barely counts. Personally, I think Tsunade-sama is just trying to extend my medical leave as long as possible."</p><p>Not that she really needed excuses, if Tsunade didn't want me taking missions, I wouldn't be taking missions. End of story. I was actually glad that if I was on Tsunade's radar, it wasn't in that way.</p><p>That would be … problematic.</p><p>"Thought you were busy working on research stuff," Shikamaru said casually, which meant it wasn't.</p><p>"I am," I countered, equally casually, and aimed more for sarcastic than passive-aggressive. "There's this thing called multitasking, where you do more than one thing at once. I know it must seem strange to you, since you try and avoid even <em> one </em> task at a time…"</p><p>Shikamaru snorted.</p><p>"No fighting at the table," Mum said, waving a wooden spoon threateningly in our direction.</p><p>I smiled at her. "Us, fighting? Too much effort, mum."</p><p>I really had to work on my deflections. It seemed like no one was buying them, ever.</p><p>I bowed away from the table, grabbed my bag, and left. It was still a little early for me to be going, but I could take the long way around. Maybe pick up something for Yakumo in town. Make it seem a little more like I was a visiting friend, not a jailor.</p><p>Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot open because of the early hour. And I had no idea what Yakumo would like anyway. In the end, I spotted a bakery that had light spilling out of the door, and brought a tray of dango and some sweet bean buns.</p><p>I went to the Kurama compound and followed the directions on the mission scroll to Yakumo's house. It… wasn't what I expected. Frankly, it looked like a mansion, and I would probably have assumed it was the house of the head of the clan, if I hadn't known otherwise.</p><p>My sensing told me that there was no one inside but Yakumo, and even her chakra was muted with sleep. I considered knocking, but I didn't want to wake her up.</p><p>On the other hand, letting myself into someone else's house felt a little weird, even if I had a key and permission.</p><p>There was a pair of muddy shoes haphazardly lying in the genkan, and I straightened them out of habit. The mud on them was still damp. That was interesting – it implied they'd been worn very recently. They <em> were</em> Yakumo's size, however. I set the food down in the kitchen, and ghosted through the house, performing a quick perimeter check and scan.</p><p>Yakumo was asleep and there was no one else in the house.</p><p>It was a large house and felt very empty. I settled awkwardly on the couch in the living room, and pulled out the seals and a notebook, carefully keeping half my attention on the sleepy presence of Yakumo's chakra.</p><p>The seals were fascinating. After about an hour, I was pretty confident that I could recreate them. I'd made copies, anyway. I thought I'd made a good job at translating parts of the seal, but I wanted to look up a few parts in my Sealing Styles book – I was sure Jiraiya had said something about them. They were done in the common Konoha style, and it had taken me an embarrassingly long time to arrive at the conclusion that the common Konoha style? Was Jiraiya's style. It was the common Konoha style <em> because</em> it was Jiraiya's style. The mess with the explosive tags yesterday and the old style of the seals on them had reminded me that sealing styles changed over the years, which I knew, I just hadn't connected that to it changing <em> because</em> of a new seal master.</p><p>Unfortunately, that book was still with Tenten, so I'd have to go and find her to get it back.</p><p>Upstairs, Yakumo was waking, chakra beginning to move around. I contemplated leaving and knocking on the door like I'd just got here, but it felt… dishonest. Not that simply being here was much better, but at least it wasn't a lie.</p><p>"Oh," Yakumo said, as she shuffled down the stairs sleepily. She was wrapped up in a set of traditional sleepwear and a housecoat, hair ruffled and unbrushed. "Good morning. Anko told me you were coming." She yawned, and rubbed at her eyes. "Sorry, I was asleep. We didn't get in till late. Did you want something to drink? Tea?"</p><p>I smiled up at her and the attempt to be a good host. "Good morning. It's fine – I hope you don't mind that I let myself in. I brought some dango and buns; I didn't know what you'd like."</p><p>I put the book down, and shuffled into the kitchen with her, offering to help make breakfast.</p><p>"What happened last night?" I asked curiously.</p><p>Yakumo blinked at the counter, picked up a cup, put it back down again, and reached for a bowl instead. "I was with Anko-sensei," she said. "We were on patrol? Because a criminal stole something yesterday, and she had to go and look for him. But she was also supposed to be watching me, so she took me with her." She seemed pleased with that.</p><p>"Ah," I said, nodding. "Tsunade-sama did say she was on patrol." I wasn't totally sure that taking Yakumo with her fit the whole 'escort/protection detail' thing, but that had been Anko's choice. It didn't seem to have done any harm. "That must have been hard."</p><p>"I liked it," Yakumo said. "It reminded me… why I wanted to be a ninja all those years ago. Not just to bring honour to the clan, but to help protect and defend people."</p><p>Personally, I thought patrol was really boring – necessary, but boring – but if it helped her, then more power to her.</p><p>"I am tired, though," she said sheepishly. "I haven't done that much exercise since training with Kurenai-sensei… Anko-sensei had to carry me home."</p><p>I smiled at her. "That just comes with training," I said. "I'm sure you'll manage in no time."</p><p>I expected a quiet day after that, and I wasn't wrong. After breakfast was cleared away, I asked Yakumo what she usually did all day.</p><p>"Paint, mostly," she said quietly, and lead me to a room dedicated to her hobby. I looked around while she slipped away to get changed.</p><p>Some of these were really gorgeous.</p><p>"What do you do with them all?" I asked, when she'd come back. "Sell them?"</p><p>Yakumo shrugged. "Uncle does sometimes, I think. I hang some of them up… but mostly I just paint over them and start again."</p><p>That was <em> sad.</em></p><p>"That's a shame. They're beautiful," I said. "I would totally buy some of these."</p><p>There was one, still sitting on the easel, of a bunch of girls in a park. I could see the splash of familiar purple denoting one figure, and thought I knew who it represented.</p><p>"It's not finished," Yakumo said, a flush rising over her cheeks. "But… you can have it when it is."</p><p>"Are you sure?" I asked. "Because I wasn't joking. I would pay for it." I didn't want her to feel obligated. And there was a hazy line about receiving gifts on duty. I didn't want it to be misinterpreted.</p><p>"Yes," Yakumo said. "A… gift. For a friend."</p><p>"Then I'd be honoured," I said. And since she was here, I couldn't resist asking her about her paintings. First the more mundane questions, like what types of paints she liked to use, and the kinds of things that she liked to paint.</p><p>"Have you ever used chakra ink?" I asked, watching her mix paint. I'd found a place to sprawl on the floor, comfortably browsing my own books. "It's what I use for seals."</p><p>"Yes," she replied affirmative. "It makes chakra conduction easier, but it is limiting. I like to use colours, and coloured ink is hard to come by. It doesn't really make the genjutsu much stronger, anyway."</p><p>Given how hard they had been to break already, I supposed she didn't really need the extra boost. They would either work on someone, or they wouldn't, and that small amount of improvement would make virtually no difference.</p><p>"Do you infuse your own chakra into it?" I asked curiously, because that was what I was really curious about.</p><p>Seals didn't run solely on the casters chakra, they took in natural energy as fuel. But I hadn't felt any such thing while she was painting during our spar. The genjutsu had – maybe – influenced the natural energy, or been carried on it, but it hadn't been fuelled by it.</p><p>"Yes," she said, casting me a slightly confused look. "While I paint. This one isn't like that, though. This is… just a painting."</p><p>Not entirely like seals, then. But not entirely <em> unlike</em> seals, either.</p><p>Of course, if it ran off of her chakra, then there was the risk of the technique running out of chakra. I … hadn't been paying attention to how much it had taken for her to maintain, or if it had just taken a certain amount to activate. It couldn't have taken that much, not the amount I would have expected for a genjutsu of that level, or she wouldn't have managed it at all.</p><p>I chewed on the tip of my pen, thinking.</p><p>"Could someone else use one of your genjutsu?" I asked. "Like, you paint it, but someone else activates it at the end? Or does it have to be you, all the way through?"</p><p>Yakumo paused. "I've never tried," she said, sounding surprised. "I don't know."</p><p>"Huh, okay." It was possible it wouldn't work, since it didn't seem to work the same as fuuinjutsu. But it was worth a try.</p><p>What I really wanted to ask about was the alter-ego she had, and how she was dealing with <em> that </em> and all its associated revelations, but it wasn't exactly the kind of thing that came up easily in casual conversation. I was probably pushing the limits of propriety by asking about her jutsu in the first place.</p><p>After lunch – eaten late because breakfast had been late – she asked me to train with her.</p><p>I was a little surprised.</p><p>"Anko-sensei has been teaching me how to tree-walk," Yakumo said, looking down. "I want to keep practicing."</p><p>"Yes, of course," I said. Chakra control exercises were cake. I could show her enough chakra control exercises that they started coming out her ears.</p><p>I guessed part of it was also that Yakumo <em> was</em> lonely. I'd thought she must be; I'd only been here a morning and the mansion seemed huge and empty to me. I'd have probably gone mad if I'd had to live there alone.</p><p>"I know it's strange… that I want to be a ninja when all I can really do is genjutsu," she said. "But there used to be a boy at the Academy who was trying to become a ninja with only taijutsu, so it's not so different, is it? I wonder what happened to him…"</p><p>I blinked. "You mean Lee? Rock Lee? He graduated the Academy last year. He's a Genin right now."</p><p>She looked at me in wonder. "So he did it," she breathed. "It is possible."</p><p>I had to wrap my head around the idea of a world where <em> Lee</em> was somebody's hero. That wasn't fair, exactly, because Lee was excellent but… It was Lee.</p><p>"Did you want to meet him?" I asked, before I really considered it. "I think he's in the village right now. I'm sure he's love to meet you."</p><p>I wasn't even joking. Lee would love her determination to be a ninja despite shortcomings. They had the same dream, just from different angles.</p><p>"Do you think that's possible?"</p><p>"Sure," I said. "I even have to talk to one of his team mates soon, so you'd probably be doing me a favour if we went together." Otherwise I'd have to wait until after curfew set in, or until my job here was over completely. And who knew where Tenten would be at that point.</p><p>Yakumo hesitated, then nodded firmly. "Yes. Let's go."</p><p>I knew where Team Gai trained, so that was my first choice of place to try and find them. I didn't actually know where Lee lived, so if they weren't there, things might get tricky.</p><p>They were though. I felt their chakra before I set foot in the Training Field, and I hovered by the edge a little nervously. I didn't want to walk straight into the middle of a fight – that was both rude and dangerous – but what could I do to attract their attention?</p><p>I didn't need to, it turned out. Tenten jumped down from the tree tops, rolling up one of her long scrolls and walked towards us.</p><p>"Saw me here, hey?" I asked.</p><p>"Neji did," Tenten replied with a shrug. "The boys are going at it, so you don't want to end up in the middle of that." She glanced curiously at Yakumo.</p><p>Right. They hadn't met.</p><p>"This is Tenten, she was away on a mission last week, so she wasn't at the kunoichi group. But she's amazing with thrown weapons, she probably has the best accuracy out of all the Genin in Konoha." I hoped that didn't sound <em> too</em> over the top. "And this is Yakumo. She's training to be a ninja right now. Uhm. Is Lee free for a few minutes?"</p><p>Tenten's eyebrows jumped upwards. "Lee? Well. Okay. Sure, let me break the fight up?"</p><p>She leapt back into the forest to find her teammates, and in a couple of minutes all five of us were standing around awkwardly.</p><p>I cleared my throat. "Yakumo is training to become a ninja specialised in the art of genjutsu. Or rather, using only genjutsu. She'd heard about the fact that you managed to become a ninja using only taijutsu, Lee."</p><p>"It's very impressive," Yakumo said, clasping her hands together and bowing. "It gives me hope that I, too, might be successful."</p><p>Neji and Tenten looked rather like I'd felt – like they needed to readjust their world view a fraction. I was glad that Neji was starting to change, actually, because if he'd said something about fate and worthlessness of attempting it, I would actually have had to kill him.</p><p>"That is splendid!" Lee said, giving her a thumbs up, and a bright, sparkling grin. "To overcome such an obstacle requires incredible determination. You must be working very hard!"</p><p>"I have been trying," Yakumo said.</p><p>And it was hard, obviously, to keep training when you had no goal and no hope that things would ever change. The fact that she <em> had</em> anyway was probably more than I would have done without some kind of outside push.</p><p>"She's been learning tree-walking," I volunteered, on her behalf.</p><p>Lee took the invitation like the champ he was. "That is fantastic! Please come and show me!"</p><p>"Wow," Tenten muttered, shaking her head, as the two of them walked away, Yakumo looking hesitantly over her shoulder at me. I waved.</p><p>"Yep," I agreed. "She's had a pretty tough time of it, though, so I figured she could use some of Lee's brand of support. I hope he doesn't mind too much. And sorry for interrupting your training."</p><p>"It's fine," Tenten said. "Neji and I can work on other stuff."</p><p>Neji was actually staring at me in what looked like disbelief. "You might not be aware," he said, carefully. "But I was recently on a mission where we encountered Yakumo…"</p><p>Oh. That was right. I'd nearly gone to Neji to ask about her in the first place. I'd forgotten that he knew that part of the story.</p><p>"The emergency response drill?" I said, equally carefully. "I'm sure you'd be glad to hear that there was a minor misunderstanding which has since been cleared up?"</p><p>A minor misunderstanding. Listen to me.</p><p>Tenten could clearly tell that there was some kind of subtext there, and glanced between the two of us, but seemed content to let the matter drop.</p><p>Neji, well. I couldn't tell what Neji actually thought of the matter. But if he wasn't going to protest, then that was all I really needed.</p><p>"Anyway, Tenten," I said, switching my attention. "Do you have that sealing book? There are a few things I wanted to look up in it."</p><p>I should have really made a copy before I gave it to her, rather than having to come and find it every time I wanted it. But making copies before it was <em> finished</em> seemed a huge waste, because if I added things or discovered that some entries were wrong, then I'd have to find and update the copies too.</p><p>"Do you want it back?" Tenten asked immediately. "You can take it. I think I've looked at everything I need."</p><p>"No, it's fine. It's nothing serious. I just couldn't remember a few things. They're a bit different to what I normally do," I explained.</p><p>Which lead to Tenten and I having a spirited discussion about sealing, while I kept half an eye on Yakumo.</p><p>"Do you think…" Yakumo asked, as we walked back. "That I could really be a ninja?" She sounded very quiet and wistful.</p><p>I regarded her seriously. "Do you really want to be?"</p><p>"Yes," she said immediately. "But I –" she swallowed and looked away. "There is a reason why Kurenai-sensei sealed me away… I don't want to be dangerous to the people around me."</p><p>Oh. So we were going to talk about this. Well.</p><p>"That's not an unfounded worry," I said carefully. "And it's not something that we should ignore. But it's also not a complete obstacle."</p><p>We let ourselves into the quiet, lonely mansion. I slipped my shoes off and stacked them neatly in the shoe rack.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Yakumo asked. She was so… unguarded, almost. Even more than the other girls I knew – like she was willing to listen and believe I had all the answers.</p><p>I paused. "How much do you know about it? You called it 'the secret power of the Kurama clan'."</p><p>"I didn't know it was like that," she said, voice hushed, eyes wide. "I make things real, like the paintings. I thought that was all there was to it. The… the monster… it… I don't know where it came from, or why it was there."</p><p>"It said…" I said, very slowly, pieces of the puzzle edging closer together in my head like the shifting of tectonic plates; slow, but inevitable. I didn't know what the shape of them would be, when they formed. "That it wanted to protect you – that it was created out of pain and suffering…"</p><p>She swallowed. "I never wanted it to do that. I never wanted it to hurt-" She hunched forward where she was sitting, hands coming up to her face. "I didn't want that."</p><p>"You couldn't control it," I agreed, watching her closely. I had to tread carefully here. "You might never be able to control it. Or make it go away. But that doesn't mean you can't work with it, or around it. It doesn't have to be an enemy for you to overcome."</p><p>Oh. There it was. The landscape of the revelation.</p><p><em> It doesn't have to be an enemy for you to overcome.</em></p><p>I'd been afraid, when I'd split apart. Jumped instantly to the worst possible outcomes. What if I hurt someone, what if, what if, what if? I'd gone to Kasuga looking for answers. No wonder he had worried, had thought that I had done something.</p><p>What had I done, when I was a shadow? <em> Exactly the same things</em> as the other half of me. It was still <em> me.</em> Was that what Kasuga had been trying to ask? Why he'd turned all those questions back on me and asked what I thought the danger was? It was my thoughts and feelings, just the ones that I didn't want to deal with, the ones I tucked away, put behind a brave face and mustered motivation to work past. What were the things that I put away, tucked into the corners of my mind and left there? Loss, and fear, and sorrow. Tiredness. Loneliness, sometimes. Jealousy and guilt.</p><p>They were the things I couldn't deal with – or couldn't deal with immediately. Was there a version of me, tucked up in my head, who felt only those things? God, what that must be like. To be only scared, tired and angry, all the time…</p><p>It would be awful. If there was a person sitting next to me, who felt only those things, how much sympathy would I have for them? How much would I try to help, and make them better? How could I do any less when there was no other person, just myself and my shadow?</p><p>I took that thought, and wrapped it in regret, and then wrapped the regret in the swell of pure gratitude rising in my chest. And then I tucked that away into the dark spot in the back of my mind.</p><p>"One day," I said to Yakumo. "You might need the protection that it offers. But until then, to protect others from it, you need to protect <em> you</em> . If it comes from your suffering and pain, then you have to look after yourself, treat yourself so that your emotions don't get to those levels. You can't just ignore them, even if that seems like the easiest way to cope."</p><p>"You think that will work?" She asked quietly.</p><p>"I hope so," I said.</p><p>I looked out the window, staring out at the sky. There's a saying that the best way to learn something is to teach it; I guess there's some truth in that.</p><p><em> I hope so.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Saying 'I don't have time right now; I'll think about it later' was exactly the kind of thing that got me into this mess in the first place. And in some circumstances, it had been the right decision.</p><p>It wasn't the right one now, I could see that. Guarding Yakumo was more about being a friend, reintroducing her to Konoha, and being on lookout for the worst case scenario than it was about keeping an exact twenty four hour watch.</p><p>That didn't mean I could fix everything <em> now.</em> This wasn't going to be something that I could just decide and do – it was going to require careful management for the rest of my life.</p><p>I flopped backwards onto the floor, sprawled out, and listened to Yakumo humming while she painted. I hoped I'd done the right thing for her, even if some of my advice amounted to little more than 'breathe deeply', 'count to ten' and 'evaluate how important it is'. It probably did me good to go over all the lessons I'd been given about being in control and about <em> feeling</em> in control, because they were things that I'd been forgetting to apply.</p><p>Stress was a downwards spiral. You stressed, and you stressed about being stressed, and then that gave you more stress… very unproductive.</p><p>"Hey, you want to help me with something today?" I asked, rolling my head vaguely in Yakumo's direction.</p><p>She looked at me quizzically, apparently a little bemused for my penchant for lying on the floor when there were perfectly acceptable chairs around. I felt like we had skipped the step in our friendship where proper guest behaviour was required though, and I liked to stretch out.</p><p>I rolled over, laying a piece of A4 paper on the ground, and kicking my feet into the air behind me. "See, I'm doing some research," I explained. "About people storing chakra into things. Say, if I take a rock and put chakra into it… how much chakra, and how long does it stay, and things like that. And if someone else takes an identical rock and does the same thing, how much changes." Research was only really good if it were repeatable, after all. "Measuring the chakra is no biggy. We already have things that do that. But obviously, there are things that will affect how two different people go about the same exercise, and one of those things is chakra control." And elemental affinity, probably. There were ways to measure that, but chakra paper was expensive and I didn't think my research budget would cover that for everyone involved, but it probably wouldn't be <em> that</em> difficult to come up with a seal that would indicate affinity-</p><p>I waved that thought off for later. "I made this seal which should help measure control, but I need people to help me test it," I concluded. "See the Fibonacci Spiral? I've put LED's – Light Emitting Diagrams – at intervals along the spiral, and the closer they get to the center, the more accurate you need to be with your chakra to activate them."</p><p>I demonstrated, threading my chakra along the path. The lights lit up, one by one. They weren't especially big or bright, and clustered tightly together as the spiral got smaller. It took a particular twist and curl to get the last ones, but all ten lit up in the end.</p><p>That was the problem. I didn't have perfect chakra control. I knew that. But I'd made the seal, and I knew how it worked, and I'd had quite a few repetitions to get it working correctly. Practice made perfect, after all. Which indicated that repeated use would invalidate the results, but that was a hurdle for a later stage.</p><p>Yakumo looked intrigued. "And you want me to have a try?"</p><p>"Yeah," I said. "If you don't mind. It's not dangerous or anything, and I'm not recording the results. It's just difficult to do myself now. I was wondering if I should make it cover only the top, say, fifty percent of the spectrum instead of the whole thing; it would make it more accurate and the most important part is clearly the top twenty to thirty percent…"</p><p>She looked a little lost, but gamely came over to sit beside me.</p><p>I withdrew my chakra from the seal, making the lights fade and scooted it over so she could try.</p><p>"Oh, I see," Yakumo said, peering into the seal as the lights lit up. "As the spiral gets smaller you have less margin for error."</p><p>She got the seventh light easily enough, but the eighth flickered before stabilising. The ninth refused to light.</p><p>"So probably somewhere between eighty and ninety percent efficiency," I said. You could calculate for chakra control efficiency – and did for medical jutsu – but as far as I was aware it was more of a theoretical thing than anything. "Of course, it's only really measuring one type of external manipulation, rather than anything inherent…"</p><p>"Why is the top thirty percent more important?" Yakumo asked, following what I'd said earlier. She withdrew her chakra from the seal and started again.</p><p>"That's the place where most shinobi are going to fall, I think," I said. "Anything below fifty percent is… well, you wouldn't be able to achieve very much. Maybe that's where the Academy students who're just learning would be, but I don't think anyone who actually works with chakra would have control so low."</p><p>Naruto had famously low control, but even he was probably not under about seventy percent. He could do the <em> Rasengan</em> . Even if you considered that he could bear a bigger chakra loss than most people, he wouldn't be able to do it at all if his control was truly so bad.</p><p>"The people that have the highest control would be the medical ninja, or genjutsu users," I continued. "And at those levels, it would probably be more useful to have a more exact measure."</p><p>I took out another paper and used a ruler to divide in the squares that would let me draw a perfect spiral. "If I use ten squares, for twenty percent, each light can be worth a two percent increase…"</p><p>As far as seals went? This was really damn simple. The spiral channelled the chakra around, and the LED's were triangles on a line, just like they would be in a circuit diagram. The trickiest part was setting the 'limit' that would require certain values of control to activate, and even that wasn't really difficult. In a way, the seal itself was 'incomplete'. It didn't hold chakra, and it didn't do anything. The LED required constant application of chakra to light up – in effect, you were completing the circuit with your own chakra like closing a switch – rather than running off the natural energy in the air.</p><p>Again, when I channelled chakra into it, all ten of the lights lit up. Yakumo got three of them, which meant eighty six percent. Not bad.</p><p>"Are you going to test it with others?" she asked, fascinated.</p><p>"I'll have to," I said. "I was going to ask Sakura… she has the best control out of our group. Though the more people I ask, the better my results will be."</p><p>"Okay, let's go!"</p><p>I hadn't meant <em> now</em> but, okay, why not? There was no reason to stay in the mansion all day.</p><p>Sakura wasn't at her house, so I waved hello to her parents and we headed off to the hospital instead, where she was in class. We had to wait till that was finished, so I grabbed some dango from a nearby stall and took Yakumo to visit Ranmaru, since he was the only person I knew currently in hospital. We must have been getting better at this ninja thing.</p><p>Poor kid looked horribly surprised to see us.</p><p>Surprisingly, after an awkward start, the two of them started to bond over being sickly kids and using genjutsu. Huh. I thought about throwing in my own two cents, but I'd never been sick like that.</p><p>"Did you do that on purpose?" Yakumo asked, as we left.</p><p>"Actually," I admitted. "I had no idea that he was a genjutsu user. Naruto ran into him on a mission a little a while ago, and brought him back to Konoha. I've only met him once. I just thought we could kill a little bit of time while we were waiting for Sakura."</p><p>"I see," Yakumo said softly.</p><p>I eyed her a little curiously, wondering what it was she saw, but she didn't elaborate.</p><p>We hovered in the corridor as the med students trickled past, waiting for that distinctive flash of pink hair.</p><p>"Shikako," Sakura said, surprised. She hefted a massive looking textbook on her hip. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>"I can't visit a friend?" I asked, hand over my heart.</p><p>She snorted. "Okay, now I know you want something."</p><p>"Ouch," I said, good naturedly, falling into step beside her as we headed for the gardens. "You got me. I kinda want your help with something."</p><p>"I knew it," Sakura said, claiming a picnic table. "It's not the…" her eyes flickered to Yakumo a little nervously. "The technique you gave me last time."</p><p>The subterfuge of it amused the hell out of me. Oh, Sakura. "Nah," I said. "Although, have you made any progress on that? Wait, nevermind. This first." If I let myself get distracted, we'd never get back on topic. It had only been a month, anyway; I didn't really expect her to have done much more than thought about it.</p><p>I took out the two seals and explained what they were.</p><p>"So I just put chakra into them?" she asked, laying a hand on top of the first.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>On the first seal, she got nine lights, and frowned.</p><p>"Ninety percent is good," I said.</p><p>But there was a determined light in her eyes as she laid a hand on the second seal. Right, Sakura was incredibly competitive.</p><p>This was either going to be great, or terrible.</p><p>One by one, the lights flickered on. Her forehead creased in concentration. Ninety two. Ninety four. Ninety six. Ninety eight.</p><p>There was a tiny surge of chakra. Ninety eight flickered and died. She'd tried to brute force it and that was the exact opposite of what you needed to do.</p><p>It came back on.</p><p>And-</p><p>"One hundred percent," I said, shaking my head. "Way to go, Sakura."</p><p>She nodded, looking satisfied. And then hesitated. "Is this <em> really</em> accurate?"</p><p>"Hard to say," I said evasively. "That's why I'm testing it. But… to the best of my abilities… yes, it is."</p><p>"I wonder what the others have…" That competitive gleam returned to her eye.</p><p>And somehow, that lead to a whole posse of medical students clustered around our table, trying out the seal, with Sakura presiding over the lot. I faded to the back of the group and observed.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Afterwards, I took Yakumo to our training grounds to work on some taijutsu.</p><p>"Even if it's not your primary method of fighting, it's good to have as a fall back," I said. "It's a good way to build up stamina, and <em> knowing</em> that you can fight if you have to can help you to feel in control."</p><p>Which, I didn't need to clarify, was especially important for Yakumo.</p><p>She was an eager pupil, I had to give her that. It was only Academy style Shorin-ryu, so it wasn't the most exciting lessons ever, but she didn't complain.</p><p>"Maybe we should stop here," I said, once we'd done roughly as much as the Academy teachers would have made us do.</p><p>"No," Yakumo protested, but she was panting pretty heavily. "We can continue." She braced her hands against her thighs and gasped for breath. "I just need… to catch my breath."</p><p>I was actually a little worried. "Twenty minutes," I said. "Walk around a little to cool down, otherwise your muscles will seize up."</p><p>Was I pushing her too hard? She was – or had been – sickly, though I didn't know exactly what that entailed. But physical fitness was a huge part of being a ninja, even if it was just in the travelling. She wouldn't get far if she couldn't run.</p><p>I hadn't made a decision either way by the time the twenty minutes were up, but in the end, I didn't have to because Sasuke turned up.</p><p>"Really, Shikako?" He asked me, after taking a good long look around the clearing. Mostly, I assumed he meant Yakumo.</p><p>"Tsunade-sama gave me the mission," I said in defence of myself. "And we're not sparring. I was showing her some taijutsu."</p><p>Sasuke sighed, sounding very put upon. "I've been looking for you," he said. "We need to practice."</p><p>I blinked at him. "Practice what?"</p><p>"Blind fighting."</p><p>He wasn't wrong. We'd been seriously caught off guard by Genno and his flash bomb, and even before that fighting at night had put us at a disadvantage.</p><p>"I'm kind of on a mission..." I trailed off. "You could start training and I'll catch up later?"</p><p>"Lee already knows," Sasuke said, crossing his arms. His pride probably drew the line at getting totally kicked around in the name of training. Mine did, unless there was no other option.</p><p>It made sense, that Lee was already experienced, if Gai-sensei was training him to fight against Sharingan. And if Lee could, then Tenten was probably a little trained too, and good luck ever blinding the Byakugan. And that probably applied to Hinata too, and Kiba and Shino had clan advantages with other senses. So the only teams that had problems were us and team ten…</p><p>I grimaced.</p><p>"Hey, Yakumo, wanna see something cool?" I asked.</p><p>Sasuke helpfully held a bandanna out towards me. He'd planned this. Jerk. For himself, he simply retied his headband lower, across his eyes.</p><p>I waited for Yakumo to take a seat near the posts, so we didn't accidentally run into her, and put on the blindfold.</p><p>"Taijutsu only," I warned. "Otherwise we'll damage ourselves."</p><p>Sasuke grunted in confirmation. Then his chakra rushed forward, straight at me.</p><p>I closed my eyes and focused on it. Feeling it get closer and closer.</p><p>I dodged to the side. Lashed out with a kick. But he must have anticipated? Because he twisted and, instead of slamming into his side, it connected solidly with his elbow.</p><p>I wasn't sure which of us yelped louder.</p><p>Oh boy. This was going to be so <em> great.</em></p><p>I staggered back a pace or two, mood unhelped by the sound of soft giggling from Yakumo's direction.</p><p>It didn't really get any better from there.</p><p><hr /></p><p>By the time I got home, I mostly just wanted a shower and to sleep.</p><p>But the instant I walked through the front door, I knew it wasn't to be. The house was dark. Neither mum nor Shikamaru were home. But Kofuku-oba was sitting at the table, drinking a cup of green tea, despite the late hour.</p><p>I felt unease creeping up my spine, the beat of my heart starting to pick up in anticipation, nerves jangling tightly with the sheer abnormality of it.</p><p>This was out of the ordinary. It couldn't mean anything good.</p><p>And that was before she opened her mouth.</p><p>"Shikako Nara. You are in so much trouble."</p><p>I gaped. "What?"</p><p>She didn't look like she was kidding either. There was a tight pinch to the corners of her mouth.</p><p>"What for?" I swallowed. My mind raced. <em> Why? </em> Because I could think of a whole lot of things that I had done – things that I <em> knew</em> – that could get me in trouble, but the kind of trouble that would come from those things wasn't the kind that ended with a quiet talk in my own house.</p><p>No. If it were <em> those things</em> then I'd know.</p><p>Something to do with the Nara Research and Development, clearly, if Kofuku-oba was the one here. But <em> what?</em> I'd barely done anything with them at all. There was a scroll on the table and she motioned at it. Hesitantly, I padded forward, feeling unreal in the utter stillness of the house, to unroll it.</p><p>It was stamped with the official mark of the tower. My trepidation rose. Looking at Kofuku-oba gave exactly no reassurance.</p><p><em> Holy shit. It's an official reprimand.</em> I read on, eyes widening. That was bad news. That was the kind of thing that went on your permanent record, and led to fines, restrictions or friggin court martial.</p><p>And it had my name on it.</p><p>I swallowed.</p><p>"What were you <em> thinking?</em> " Kofuku-oba's voice cracked. "Testing seals on Konoha shinobi!"</p><p>"I wasn't!" I protested immediately, because it sounded <em> so bad </em> when she said it like that. "I didn't!" Panic was clawing at my chest, squeezing my heart. I gripped the scroll tightly, the words on it hammering into my mind with their severity.</p><p>"Then explain this to me!" She actually slapped the table. "If this is how you act, then I <em> will</em> ban you from the department and bar you from the libraries. This is not a game, and these are not toys! There are laws against this for a reason! Do you understand the damage you've done to the clan? The kind of penalties we'll face from the village for this?"</p><p>"I didn't!" I said, wide-eyed and almost panicked, under the barrage of condemnation. "It doesn't even <em> do</em> anything! I just wanted Sakura to see it."</p><p>"Explain," Kofuku-oba ordered, thankfully halting in her lecture and letting me <em> actually do so</em> .</p><p>I pulled out the seals, showed them, explained what they did and what had happened. It was those fucking medical students that had got me in trouble – and they'd been the ones who <em> wanted</em> to try it out. So eager to compare their scores against each other.</p><p>"We need to get this registered, <em> now,</em> " Kofuku-oba decided. "That'll eliminate the problem of it being untested… but you <em> cannot</em> do this again, do you understand? I don't care if your friends agree – any seals you want to test on anyone other than yourself? You do through the official channels. At least that way we can cover you if things go wrong."</p><p>"Yes, oba-san," I said meekly, eyes down, shoulders hunched; the perfect appearance of submission. "Thank you."</p><p>"Don't thank me yet," she said grimly. "We have a long night ahead of us."</p><p>She was right. She dragged me out of the house, to the main R&amp;D office, and dropped a stack of paperwork in front of me.</p><p>"Fill that out. I have damage control to run," she said briskly. "And don't even think about going anywhere."</p><p>I didn't. I felt like I was physically bound in place by the weight of disappointment and disapproval. I could barely breathe with it. And when I lifted my hand to grasp the pen, it shook like I was coming down off an adrenaline high.</p><p>I swallowed, and began to fill out the papers. There were problems almost immediately – it was clear they were designed with the main pharmaceutical staple of the clan in mind, all the terminology geared towards drugs, and did not crossover well to seals.</p><p>Name? I penned in 'Chakra Control Measurement Gauge Seal' then wanted to cross it out because it was needlessly complicated and redundant but didn't because I only had one copy of the form and didn't want to make a mess.</p><p>I didn't want to do anything that would make Kofuku-oba more upset at me.</p><p>But the contents were only paper and chakra ink, and that meant I couldn't answer the next three questions or provide supporting documentation as to their purity. It wasn't a pharmaceutical product. It was just ink. Just paper.</p><p>I spent close to an hour filling it out, thinking and rethinking my answers and nearly gnawing my lip right through out of nervous biting.</p><p>"I've rounded up several ninja who are willing to assess and vouch for your seal," Kofuku-oba said, appearing out of the hallway and snapping up the papers. "You're going to owe them very large favours for the foreseeable future. Come."</p><p>I scrambled after her.</p><p>I was a little relieved to see that Takatori was one of them, even if I didn't <em> especially</em> want him to also be disappointed. The others, I didn't really know personally. Ryosen Nara, who worked in Analytics. Todai Nara who did something relating to quality control approval.</p><p>"Is this the seal?" Ryosen asked immediately. "Is it accurate? How much chakra does it take to run? Can it be mass produced? Is the scale consistent from person to person? What's the margin of error? How much does individual repeatability vary?"</p><p>"More importantly," Takatori said. "Is it safe? What's the output? What's the <em> input</em> and where does the difference go? What happens if it gets overloaded?"</p><p>I wilted back under the barrage of focused questioning. "Umm," I said, intelligently, holding the seal almost like a shield in front of me. No one came to my rescue.</p><p>I decided to focus on Takatori's questions first, which sounded, at the heart of it, more important.</p><p>"The output of the seal is ten points of blue light, that is electromagnetic waves of approximately 500 nanometers and about the same intensity as a single candle," I started, clearing my throat.</p><p>I had a feeling this was going to take a while.</p><p>I was right. Once they ran out of questions for me – and that took a <em> long while</em> – then we moved into testing the seal. Firstly they wanted to prove that it was safe, which, okay, fine, and measure the chakra input and output and the intensity of the light and I had to draw up about ten identical seals for repeatability testing. Then there were more questions and more testing, and by the end of it, I was mostly just following commands on autopilot.</p><p>"Form and function are both very simple," Ryosen said, eventually. "The ability to accurately and easily measure chakra control of test subjects will come in extremely handy for large survey groups, especially as the seal is reusable and reproducible. Medical might find it useful as well." She nodded. "I'll sign off on it."</p><p>"It passes the safety tests," Takatori said, covering a yawn.</p><p>"I'm not happy with the rush testing," Todai said, crossing his arms. "I'll sign, but I'm putting a month long sale restriction on it – I want a full test completed before we even think about producing these."</p><p>Kofuku nodded crisply. "That's fair. I'll get the paperwork completed and submitted to the Hokage's office in response to their complaint. Thank you all for your time." She dropped a hand to my shoulder and <em> gripped.</em> "Come along, Shikako. You aren't finished yet. I want a proposal for intended uses, benefits and advantages of this seal."</p><p>My eyes flicked to the clock. "I have a mission in the morning."</p><p>Her voice was unyielding. "Then you had better write quickly."</p><p>I hunched over the desk, sullenly filling pages with bullshit explanations on the 'real world applications' on a seal that had taken me no more than an idle thought to design. Ryosen had provided more than a few potential uses in her own field, and had seemed legitimately interested in the field, so that was something.</p><p>But the more I considered the situation, the more it <em> burnt.</em></p><p>Everything I'd done, the secrets I held, the decisions I'd made in the field – and this was the thing that got me punished?</p><p>It was ridiculous.</p><p>I stretched by arms above my head and bent backwards until my spine cracked. The clock told me that it was nearly four o'clock in the morning, which meant I wasn't getting any sleep tonight no matter what.</p><p>I bared my teeth in a move that no one would mistake for a smile, and found my original proposal for the chakra stone project. Then, with lines of my pen so savage that the nib scored holes in the paper, lined the whole thing out.</p><p>'Amendment to Proposal SN-012610-01' I penned neatly, at the top of a new page. And then proceeded to outline a study into chakra matrixes that was completely divorced from the idea of user variance and thus required <em> no fucking chakra control analysis.</em></p><p>If I could do it, and no one else could, fine. Great. Fantastic even.</p><p>Clearly no one wanted it anyway.</p><p>"You don't have to re-design that now," Takatori said, leaning against the door. "Kofuku-oba isn't that angry. She was just worried and trying to get enough paperwork together to prove your case. She <em> is</em> fighting this on your behalf."</p><p>I shrugged stiffly, not looking up at him. "I'm minimising the chances of a repeat occurrence by eliminating the need for outside participants."</p><p>"Oh. I see," Takatori said, sounding far too shrewd and knowing. "This isn't about appeasing anyone at all. This is about tanking the seal that got you in trouble so that it never sees the light of day and no one ever benefits from it at all. That's a little petty, Shikako-chan."</p><p>I couldn't stop the reflexive flinch of my shoulders. I refused to look up at him.</p><p>"You know that you won't be allowed to work on anything outside the scope of your project until you can prove trustworthy again. And that, if there's no one to take charge and pushing it through the testing, that seal will just linger indefinitely in quarantine." He plucked the proposal off my desk and skimmed it. "And that if it ever did get to the point of sale, the hospital would probably be a big purchaser. My, my. No one quite does passive-aggressive like a Nara."</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>"Ryosen will be disappointed," he added lightly. "She's already quite excited about the possibilities of adding it to her population surveys. Something about kicking the myth of kunoichi being better at control?"</p><p>I didn't rise to that bait either.</p><p>He sighed. The paper fluttered back to the desk, and his hand landed heavy but friendly on my head. "It's not the end of the world kid," he said kindly, fluffing my hair. "We all fuck up sometimes."</p><p>My throat closed, leaving me speechless. I wasn't sure what I would have said, if it hadn't, but I doubted it would have been pretty.</p><p><em> That wasn't the point.</em></p><p>When I'd fucked up, I'd gotten myself killed. This wasn't a fuck up. This wasn't <em> anything.</em> It meant nothing, it did nothing, and it was so fucking <em> unfair.</em></p><p>I breathed in through my nose, muscles so tense that they shook.</p><p>"Get some rest," Takatori said gently. "It'll look better in the morning."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I didn't get sleep, and it didn't look better in the morning.</p><p>I washed my face in the office bathroom, combing wet fingers through my hair and trying to look a little less like how I felt. It would do no good to show up at Yakumo's like that.</p><p>It felt like it took herculean effort to straighten my shoulders, and smooth my face into something that looked calm and happy.</p><p><em> Good enough.</em></p><p>"Good morning," I said to Yakumo, voice carefully bright but not chirpy.</p><p>She smiled in return, not appearing to notice anything out of the ordinary. "Good morning."</p><p>I felt myself relax a fraction. "Did you have plans for today?"</p><p>Yakumo shrugged. "Could we do some more training?" She asked. "I promise I'll try harder."</p><p>"Of course," I said. "I think I can come up with something."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

Do what you can. ~Arthur Ashe</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Oh, Shikako," Mum said with a sigh.</p><p>I braced myself for the scolding. I'd dragged my feet returning home because of it, ugly anticipation twisting in my gut, but there was really no way to avoid it forever. I'd just have to suck it up, sit quietly, and nod.</p><p>"Come and sit down," she said instead, patting the couch beside her.</p><p>I padded over, feet silent against the tatami floor.</p><p>At least Shikamaru was upstairs, and not sitting there watching with his stupid smug face. I didn't need to know <em> his</em> opinion on this too.</p><p>"You look miserable, my girl." Her hand brushed the bangs off my face. "It's been a tough few days, hasn't it?"</p><p>I blinked. That wasn't… that wasn't to script.</p><p>She exhaled. "I wish your father were here. He'd have had this all sorted out before it even became a problem. But I'd be a poor mother if I relied on him for everything."</p><p>"What are you talking about?" I asked, tilting my head in puzzlement. This wasn't what I had prepared for. I didn't know what to say.</p><p>"Tell me what's wrong," Mum said gently.</p><p>I frowned. "But you know what's wrong." Of course she <em> knew.</em> Kofuku-oba would have explained. Heck, she'd probably been the one to receive the reprimand on my behalf, if it had been delivered to the clan.</p><p>"I know what happened," she corrected patiently. "But I don't know what's wrong."</p><p>"I don't either," I said, voice suddenly very small. Why did someone else saying it make it so much easier to voice? "I don't… I don't understand. Why am I in trouble <em> this </em> time? I've made bigger seals than that and no one cared."</p><p>I'd spent <em> years</em> fluffing around with explosives, for crying out loud. Sometimes around clan heirs. And it had never garnered anywhere near that kind of response. Parental supervision, yes, but we'd never been in <em> trouble</em> for it.</p><p>"Oh, sweetheart." Mum's eyes filled with understanding, and she wrapped an arm around my shoulders. "You know, when I got married, there were a whole lot of things that I had to learn about how to live in a clan. And it wasn't even the big things that tripped me up, because I knew to watch for them. But there were some things that were so common that no one ever thought to warn me about because they were so <em> obvious.</em> It was their mind set, the way they'd grown up… and I hadn't."</p><p>I leant against her, listening, even if I couldn't quite see the comparison.</p><p>"You might have grown up in a clan," she continued. "But you were trained for the field, not the hospital or research labs. I don't think they quite understand how different that is. You wouldn't throw a medical ninja in the field without more training, and they shouldn't have expected you to do the opposite." She sounded quite firm about that.</p><p>"I don't…" I trailed off. Was there something there? Something that was so obvious that I didn't see it? Staring at me, right in front of my face? I was no stranger to having a perspective that was <em> just</em> a little too different to see all the right things.</p><p>"For you – and for me – a seal is a weapon," she said. "You can use it in battle, or in training, or you can pass it to a friend… it can be dangerous, yes, but that's what weapons are."</p><p>I nodded. The analogy was apt. It was so apt it wasn't even an <em> analogy.</em> Seals were jutsu were weapons. It was how you used them that made them dangerous, absolutely, and a kunai could cut dinner as easily as an enemy… but it was a weapon all the same.</p><p>"But for medical ninja, that's not how they see it." Mum glanced at me. "They see seals as more… like medicine."</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>"Everything in the hospital is controlled, before it ever gets used on a patient," Mum said.</p><p>I nodded. I knew that. I approved of that. Health standards and quality control and all that sort of thing. It wasn't <em> quite</em> like the system I was used to, since you still had things like the secret Nara Medical Encyclopaedia and ingredients and medicines were still <em> secret</em> . But the clan was trusted – entrusted? enforced? – with ensuring that the medicines and ingredients we used were up to standard, and did what they said they would do.</p><p>It might not also have been <em> strictly</em> true, since medical ninja were a lot more likely to employ on the spot inventions and experimental drug treatments in response to extreme injuries.</p><p>"Well, that doesn't just apply to the medicine itself. Fuuinjutsu is also very common at the hospital, as a tool for the medic nin to use. So they're also very strict about the quality of the seals that they use."</p><p>"Oh," I said, as I understood. If they considered it the equivalent of handing out untested drugs, then yes, I could see why they made it a big deal. It <em> wasn't</em> the same but… "It was because I was at the hospital."</p><p>"And because you work for the research division," Mum added. "Even if you weren't doing it <em> directly</em> for them, you're still affiliated with them and have to follow their rules."</p><p>Which meant that if I hadn't been working for them, but had done the exact same thing… would it have been such an issue?</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not.</p><p>I slumped even further, feeling exhausted.</p><p>"Kofuku and I never exactly got along," Mum continued, and I knew that. Mum and Dad getting married had been a Thing, capital T, and relations inside the clan hadn't exactly thawed out until Shikamaru and I were born. That was probably due more to Shikamaru than me. Everyone wanted a strong heir.</p><p>"But she is the best person to be running damage control on this," she said, smoothing a hand over my shoulder. "It won't turn out too badly. I don't expect you'll get more than a warning for it."</p><p>I heaved a sigh. "It's just… troublesome," I complained.</p><p>It was easy to forget – and I was guilty of this – that mum nagged because she loved us and we were miserable at actually doing the shit she told us to do, not because she got any particular joy in repeating the same thing over and over again. We'd have been worse off if we didn't have her constantly prodding us into action.</p><p>It was probably a good thing that mum had talked to me first, because when I headed to my room, I found Shikamaru sitting at the top of the stairs.</p><p>I'd sensed him – but I'd rather thought he would leave before I got there.</p><p>It was clear that he had heard us… and that he'd had the same thought that I had.</p><p>If I had not been in the research division, would I have been in trouble now? And… who, exactly, was responsible for the fact that I was?</p><p>He looked stricken.</p><p>I was angry with him. And hurt that he'd tried to undermine me. And exasperated at the whole situation.</p><p>But he was still my brother - he was still the boy that had fought a god for me and won - and I still loved him. I didn't want him hurt or upset. Not even when I was angry at him.</p><p>"Go to sleep, Shika," I said, sighing. "They'll fix it."</p><p>"I'm sorry," he said.</p><p>"You're not, really," I contradicted, quietly, because I knew that underneath the guilt he still thought he was <em> right</em> . Maybe, from his point of view, he was. "You're sorry it went wrong." I stepped past him, bumping his shoulder gently. "I'm tired. I really want to sleep."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The hearing was set for the day after my mission officially ended, which was a mixed blessing. On one hand, I didn't have to <em> quit</em> my mission, or be suspended, which was what I suspected should have happened if the situation had been a little less muddy. On the other, it was awful to have so much time to consider it, because there was nothing I could do to prepare or change the outcome of it – it just hung over my head like a very pale imitation of the sword of Damocles.</p><p>I spent the rest of the week intensely introducing Yakumo to the idea of 'normality' or whatever that was, trying to get her re-involved in the village and its people. We went shopping, to the onsen, went training, met up with friends… I wanted her to have things to fall back on when I wasn't constantly around. Also, it was better to have first meetings in a semi-controlled setting, just in case.</p><p>Not that she'd had another … event, anyway. I wondered how many she had had before they'd decided to seal her power away. Surely it couldn't have been that many. Yes, the one I knew about had been destructive, but since then there had been a single one while we were in the middle of a fight, and talking about her parents death.</p><p>You could hardly blame her for feeling a little threatened there.</p><p>"I yield," Yakumo said, gasping, as I pinned her to the training field ground.</p><p>I pulled my forearm away from her throat. I had restricted myself to taijutsu, which was why I was in so close, in order to keep it a little fair. I hadn't <em> forbidden</em> her from using genjutsu, but I'd made sure it was damn difficult for her to do so. Her paintings needed a fair bit of set up time, and I just hadn't given it to her. Apart from that, her genjutsu were good, but not unbreakable, and I'd shaken them, even if it had been tricky at times – with layered illusions, or time based ones, or ones that activated as I dispelled the last.</p><p>She wasn't bad but, even holding back, I was better.</p><p>"How do you feel?" I asked.</p><p>She paused. "A little disappointed," she confessed. "I thought I would do better."</p><p>"But not worried," I said. "Even when I pinned you down, there was nothing."</p><p>"I guess I knew you wouldn't hurt me…" Yakumo said.</p><p>Which was a dangerous mind set, really. Because she wouldn't believe anyone was trying to hurt her right up until they did, which was going to be the least appropriate time to work out if she was going to transform into her alter ego or not. But there was very little I could do about that – I doubted she'd believe any of the other Konoha 12 were going to hurt her either, so I couldn't even ask them to spar with her.</p><p>Or I could try and convince her that I <em> was…</em> but no. I'd have to go a long way to be convincing and that would break all the trust that had built between us.</p><p>I didn't think it was worth it.</p><p>I sighed. "Ready to go again?"</p><p>The problem with having one deadline looming over me, was that it reminded me of the greater, further off deadlines that I had to deal with. I hadn't <em> forgotten</em> them, precisely, but they were harder, vaguer goals with a nebulous timeframe.</p><p>I had tried but there was very little in the way of results. Even linking Aoi to Hidden Rain was iffy – I had no idea if he knew anything worth knowing or if Konoha would give the information the weight that it really had.</p><p>What was this compared to that?</p><p>I knew what I <em> should</em> have been focusing on, though I could only guess at how. It was just… it had been fun. It had been fun, and interesting, and felt like it would be rewarding to get involved with research. I had gained access to information, that was true, and I knew that would come in helpful with my own sealing, but…</p><p>It had been fun.</p><p>And now the idea of it filled me with dull dread rather than anticipation.</p><p>I had been back to the research division, mostly to complete whatever forms my aunt wanted, and to actually hunt down some kind of goddamn rulebook so I didn't cross any lines again. But it had lost its shine.</p><p>I would finish the project I was working on, because I'd said I would, but beyond that I didn't know. All the little things that had threatened to spin off into side projects suddenly seemed less interesting, less important.</p><p>I had the Book of Gelel. That was a resource better than most of what I was getting from the clan. If I didn't continue to do research for them, I would still be able to progress in my own sealing. Maybe a little limited in scope, but I would be fine.</p><p>It was a thought I turned over again and again during that week.</p><p>"Anko-sensei!" Yakumo greeted happily. "You've returned! Please come in!"</p><p>Anko stepped into the house, followed closely by Ino. They were both still carrying packs strapped across their backs, having clearly come straight here. Ino looked… not happy, exactly, but confident. Settled.</p><p>"Welcome home," I murmured. "How did it go?"</p><p>Ino smirked at me. "That's classified," she teased. She flipped her ponytail over her shoulder. "But you know, we made a new friend. Brought her home with us. Her name is Isaribi; she's at the hospital getting checked out by Tsunade-sama right now."</p><p>Despite the teasing tone, she seemed to be serious. It was actually classified, then? Had it evolved to be classified? Or – no, I didn't know what their mission had been in the first place, did I? Land of Sea, but what and why…</p><p>"Oh, no, is she seriously hurt?" I asked.</p><p>"She's not injured," Ino answered. "She ran afoul of some people who were interested in bloodlimits. You know how it goes."</p><p>Ino, with her new found knowledge of Orochimaru and his history. Anko, with her own. A girl with bloodlimit experiments. Classified.</p><p>It wasn't a totally secure conclusion. There were other possible explanations. But.</p><p>"I see," I said. "That's terrible. I hope she gets better soon."</p><p>Ino nodded. "Yeah, she will." She shrugged. "Well, Anko said she was coming here, so I just wanted to swing by and let you know we were back all in one piece. I should go home; have a shower. I swear I've got road dust in my hair."</p><p>I smiled. "You'd never notice," I assured her.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The hearing took place the next morning.</p><p>Mum wrestled my hair into twin pigtail braids, rather than its normal single braid, and fished a formal shirt out of my closet for me to wear. I wasn't even allowed to wear my kunai pouch or leg holster.</p><p>I looked all of about ten years old.</p><p>It seemed that we weren't above taking advantage of my age and relative lack of experience in arguing our side of the case. It wasn't, particularly, that looking young bothered me. It had been a long time since I looked the age I thought I was, and I had recently looked ten. Or eight. Or five.</p><p>It was just that it frustrated me, that we had to go through this rigmarole and illusion, rather than simply presenting the facts and having the correct judgement made from that.</p><p>"It will have to do," Mum said critically, twitching a piece of hair so that it curled closer to my face.</p><p>I gave her my best wide, sad bambi eyes, and fiddled with the sleeves that were a fraction too long and covered my hands.</p><p>She looked nothing but amused. "Keep that up and we'll have no problem," she said dryly. "Put your shoes on. Now remember, Kofuku is going to do most of the talking, but if they want your opinion-"</p><p>"Then I am very sorry and I won't do it again," I said dutifully, even if I rolled my eyes. I sat and pulled my sandals on.</p><p>Shikamaru had left for a mission with Chouji and Kiba during the week, for which I was mostly thankful; otherwise, I knew he would have insisted on coming with us. I didn't think we needed an <em> audience. </em></p><p>Kofuku-oba was waiting outside for us and we headed into town together. I felt increasingly awkward the further from home we went, dressed differently, hair done strangely and on my way to an official meeting.</p><p>I fiddled with my too long sleeves.</p><p>We entered the tower, Kofuku leading the way and winding through the hallways until we reached a set of hallways signposted as the Judiciary. It wasn't an area that I had been before.</p><p>There was a receptionist, to whom Kofuku submitted a set of papers and had a quick and quiet conversation, and a waiting room with a few stiff backed chairs where mum and I took a seat.</p><p>Then we waited. It was very boring.</p><p>They could have at least supplied us with magazines.</p><p>My hands twitched, curling in my sleeves. I hadn't actually brought any of my notebooks with me, so I couldn't even take one out to work on. I suspected that wouldn't have gone over well anyway – hence leaving them behind in the first place.</p><p>Well. Even if I couldn't write it down, I could still think. They couldn't stop me doing <em> that.</em></p><p>Sometime later, mum jostled my shoulder, shaking me out of my contemplation and back to my surroundings. Reluctantly, I slid to my feet and followed the two of them into one of the offices.</p><p>"Now, Shikako Nara, is it?" The man behind the office desk asked, peering at me through his glasses. He looked about sixty, maybe, hair white with age and face lined. There was no sense of hidden strength to him, or power, like there had been with the Hokage, though he seemed perfectly commanding in this room.</p><p>Bambi eyes, I reminded myself. "Yes, sir." I bowed.</p><p>"Alright, take a seat." He waited as we did so. "Now the complaint was lodged by the hospital and is a charge of failing to abide by testing restrictions and endangering the health and safety of Konoha shinobi."</p><p>Kofuku-oba laid out the situation, neatly and concisely, though she was very vague on the details of what I was actually working on for the clan.</p><p>They debated a little over the differences between 'shinobi testing a seal' and 'testing a seal on shinobi' and went over the documents that we'd provided to prove that the seal really was harmless.</p><p>"I see," he said afterwards. "I believe I have a full understanding of the situation now. Is there anything else you would like to add?"</p><p>I tucked my hands flat beneath my thighs and waited. This was it.</p><p>"Despite the seriousness of the initial accusation," he said, taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes. "I believe this was not an incidence caused by malice or wilful disregard of our laws. However, negligence is still dangerous, especially when we consider the ways in which this situation <em> could</em> have gone. In that light, I am reducing this reprimand to a warning, though it will still be noted on your permanent record. In the next six months, I expect to see evidence that you acknowledge and understand the rules and regulations involving seal use and research testing in Konoha, and the reasons behind them. I charge the Nara clan with seeing this is carried out."</p><p>I nodded solemnly, though it didn't seem so bad. Actually, that sounded like I was getting off really lightly. I'd have to, what, fill out a questionnaire? Write an essay, maybe. I'd already looked up the damn rules.</p><p>"I'm also going to levy a fine, to be paid to the village in the next quarter," he finished, stamping the scroll and signing it. He handed it to mum, and the three of us stood and bowed.</p><p>Kofuku-oba sighed as we left the tower. "I thought we'd get away without the fine," she said regretfully. "But it wasn't too bad, overall."</p><p>I peeked at the scroll mum was holding. It was… well. It wasn't a small amount. It would probably have taken a Genin a good few months to try and pay that off, especially if they'd had other things to drain mission pay away. But… it was less than I'd been paid from my last big mission.</p><p>My last 'big mission' had been an S-rank; if it came out of my pay, I wasn't really going to suffer much.</p><p>Mum rested her hand on my shoulder, and tucked the scroll away. "You let me worry about that," she said. "Why don't we get something to eat?"</p><p>She nodded goodbye to Kofuku-oba, and we found a nice little café to sit and drink tea at. She even ordered me a plate of sweets without admonishing that they'd ruin my teeth, weren't healthy, or that it was nearly lunch time.</p><p>That definitely indicated she was worried, but since the hearing was over, I wasn't sure about what.</p><p>I drank my tea quietly.</p><p>"Hey, hey! It's Shikako's mum!" Naruto's voice broke the silence, yelling cheerfully across the street. "Hi!"</p><p>He dragged Sasuke along behind him, weaving through the people on the road like they were an obstacle course and he was being timed.</p><p>"Hey, have you seen- No, way! Shikako, you look different."</p><p>I propped my elbow on the table and rested my chin in my palm. "Really?" I asked dryly.</p><p>Naruto squinched his eyes at me; I couldn't tell if he was trying to glare or smile. Maybe both.</p><p>"We were totally looking for you," he said accusingly. "It's team training, how could you miss it?"</p><p>I considered. Then affected a very familiar drawl. "Mah, well, I had a very important meeting, and when that was over, I had to recover my spirit through the quick application of wagashi-"</p><p>"No!" Naruto hollered, sounding absolutely horrified. "You can't become sensei!"</p><p>He was so melodramatic. I let my lips curl into a smirk.</p><p>Sasuke rolled his eyes. "We didn't have training planned, idiot," he said, and elbowed Naruto in the side. "She didn't know."</p><p>"But you know now!" Naruto said, apparently recovering quickly from his shock. "So let's go!"</p><p>I smiled at mum. "It sounds like I have no choice," I said, slipping from my seat. "Can I go?"</p><p>She smiled back, lifting her cup. "Have fun."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"So what's with the…" Sasuke said, after we'd finished fighting, waving a vague hand in my direction.</p><p>I pulled a kunai out of a tree trunk, and examined it to try and decide which one of the boys it belonged to. I'd had to liberate a few from them at the start of the fight, on account of not having my own with me, but there were enough items in the training field that could be impromptu weapons in a pinch.</p><p>Being creative had been… fun.</p><p>I shrugged. "I had a meeting," I said, touching the pigtails a little self-consciously. I threw the kunai into the dirt near Naruto and started to re-braid them properly.</p><p>"Yeah?" Sasuke prompted, frowning at his new Fuuma Shuriken. His last one had been destroyed with Genno's traps, but this one's opening mechanism seemed to stick. It was possible there was some grit in it, or that the plates weren't quite formed properly. He'd have to sort it out before he took it into the field, or that could cause problems at the worst moment.</p><p>I thought about putting them off – calling it 'clan stuff' or just out right deflecting – but that wasn't fair. They'd asked. They were my team.</p><p>I gave them a short summary of what had happened.</p><p>"What?!" Naruto exclaimed, outraged. He bounced to his feet. "That's not fair! I'll tell 'em that you didn't mean to hurt anyone!"</p><p>I waved him off. "It's fine," I said. "Everything is sorted now. It doesn't matter."</p><p>"You didn't say anything before," Sasuke said, still frowning at his weapon.</p><p>"To be honest," I said. "I didn't want to talk about it. There was nothing that either of us could do to fix it. And… it just made me upset to think about it."</p><p>It still did, a little. I didn't like admitting that I'd made mistakes. I'd rather the whole thing was dropped in a deep hole and forgotten about, actually.</p><p>"Don't be upset!" Naruto said, switching from indignant to concerned. He patted me awkwardly on the shoulder and threw a slightly desperate look at Sasuke.</p><p>I sighed and threw an arm around his shoulder to pull him into a hug. "Thank you, but you don't have to worry. Just forget about it, okay?"</p><p>Sasuke was watching out of the corner of his eye, even if he pretended his attention was focused on the shuriken. He snapped it shut. "In that case; round two?"</p><p>I grinned. "Prepare to go down."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"I'm assigning you a B-rank mission," Tsunade said, after summoning Naruto and I to her office. "You'll be apprehending this man – Gosunkugi, also known as The Nail. He recently stole an artefact of some value from the Land of Tea's court; they're eager to get it back."</p><p>"No problem," Naruto said confidently. "It'll be just like the time with that weird teddy bear statue."</p><p>Tsunade looked like she was trying to cover a smile. "Quite," she agreed. "It's unlikely that the item is still in his possession at this point. Mostly likely it's been sold on the black market. If that <em> is</em> the case, we'll have to question him until we can begin to track it down again." She picked up the mission scroll on her desk and threw it to Naruto. "He's been keeping his head low, but we got word that he's been spotted in the Land of Stone. I want you to head there and track him down."</p><p>I hesitated. "Just the two of us, Tsunade-sama?"</p><p>"No, your third teammate will be here soon," she said.</p><p>I wondered who it would be. Apart from the team that returned with Naruto, Hinata was the only other rookie still in Konoha. She would have been a good choice for a mission like this too; it was more to her skill than ours. But either Shino or Ino would have been a handy addition, in different ways.</p><p>Turned out, even I could be completely blindsided.</p><p>"Hello," said the boy who stepped into the office. "It's nice to meet you." He smiled.</p><p>I turned to look at Tsunade.</p><p>"Eh?" Naruto asked, puzzled. "Who are you?"</p><p>"He's an experienced Chunin who's been assigned to your team for this mission," Tsunade introduced. "This is Sai."</p><p>She had to know.</p><p>She had to. There was no way she <em> didn't</em> know who he was – who he worked for. Not if she was assigning him to Naruto's team. Sure, it was Sasuke that had so far been targeted, but thinking that Tsunade wouldn't be equally careful with Naruto was missing the point.</p><p>Which begged the question of <em> why?</em> Why put him here? What was she hoping to accomplish?</p><p>And what was <em> Danzo</em> hoping to accomplish? Sai, in the story, had always been a double agent. He'd… what, been supposed to go after Sasuke? Or deal with Orochimaru? But that wasn't the case here and now. It couldn't be. So what <em> was</em> his goal?</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>There was not a single expression that gave away anything on the Hokage's face. I might as well have been staring at the carved mountainside, for all the good it was doing.</p><p>"Shikako Nara. Pleased to meet you," I echoed, bowing to Sai, and pasting on an equally bland smile. "I hope we can work well together."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Naruto said, and jabbed his thumb towards himself. "I'm Naruto Uzumaki, Konoha's Number One Most Unpredictable Ninja." He grinned. "I hope you're good. You're gunna need to be, to keep up with us."</p><p>"I am," Sai said, completely without any bravado.</p><p>Naruto faltered at that, just a little. He was used to people self-promoting, or being intimidating, but <em> actual</em> confidence was something different. But his smile came back full force in under a second. "Great. Let's go then."</p><p>"Tsunade-sama," I said lowly. "Since Sai has yet to be briefed… I assume that Naruto is the Team Leader for this mission?"</p><p>She'd introduced Sai as 'more experienced' after all, which tended to indicate that he would be the one. I just… well. I didn't trust him as far as I could throw him, as the saying went.</p><p>I didn't want him in charge. I didn't want him arguing that he should be in charge. And I really didn't want Naruto to fall into the habit of listening to him like he was in charge.</p><p>"That's right," Tsunade agreed. "Naruto could use a little more experience as a Team Leader. Though I'm sure Sai will be willing to offer advice and guidance should the need arise."</p><p>I bowed to her, thankful that that was one hurdle down. Now I just had to find the rest of the hurdles, before I could clear them.</p><p><em> Why are you here, Sai?</em></p><p>He wasn't supposed to show up for <em> years.</em> That meant that something was different, somewhere along the lines. I didn't expect that nothing would have changed after all this time, but… well.</p><p>He could still have been after Sasuke, in an oblique fashion, trying to get at him through us. But that felt like it was reaching a little. There were easier ways.</p><p>"How long have you been a Chunin, Sai?" I asked politely as we headed towards the gates. "You didn't take part in the last Chunin Exams." It was both an attempt to break the ice with small talk, and to fish for information. I wasn't sure if anything that Sai would tell me was <em> true</em> but… well. There had to be something.</p><p>"Two years," Sai responded and didn't elaborate further.</p><p>To be fair, it answered the question directly – it just didn't respond to the social cue to <em> talk.</em></p><p>I couldn't tell if that was deliberate or not. My knowledge of Sai had him being generally offensive and insulting, with an added smile. It could have been pure social incompetence, but there had to be a factor of deliberateness to how often he had hit the mark.</p><p>"Oh yeah?" Naruto said, falling into step on Sai's other side. "Where did you take the exam then? It wouldn't have been Konoha, right? Since that only happens every three years." Naruto looked pleased with himself for remembering that – which he probably only knew because Idate had made a big deal out of it. But whatever worked.</p><p>"It was not," Sai said placidly.</p><p>This was going to be so fun. I could tell.</p><p>"So where was it?" Naruto persisted.</p><p>We spent much of the trip that way, pressing Sai for information and occasionally throwing out small, unimportant tidbits about ourselves so that it didn't seem like a total interrogation – or at least I did. I was pretty sure Naruto considered the whole thing a successful conversation.</p><p>It wasn't that I didn't like Sai, or that I didn't want to help him, or didn't think he deserved helping. That wasn't the case. If I could, I would have gladly welcomed him into Team Seven and had him at our backs.</p><p>But I knew that he worked for Danzo. And that made him dangerous to us. Until I could work out what he wanted and why he was here… I couldn't trust him.</p><p>"Do we want to set up camp here?" I asked, as the sun was starting to sink towards the horizon. "I don't think there are any inns along this way."</p><p>Land of Stone was an offshoot of the Land of Earth, wedged in the bordering countries between it and Land of Wind. It had been part of Earth Country up until the last war, when Konoha's offensive –read, the Yellow Flash – had devastated the border line so fully that the troops had had to pull back and abandon miles of ground including all the war bases and outposts. The outposts had been reclaimed by locals made homeless by the war, and they'd managed to cobble together a series of functioning villages and governance before Hidden Rock had thought to do anything about the place after the war ended.</p><p>Whether it was its own country, or a vassal state of Land of Earth, depended entirely on who you talked to – the Daimyo of Earth Country claimed it as theirs, but everyone else tended to accept it as a tiny, unimportant country of its own.</p><p>The fastest way to get there, by rights, would have been to head north-west from Konoha and cut through Land of Rivers and Land of Wind. Of course, that ignored terrain issues – the fact that River Country was basically one giant mountain range, and the fact that the desert of the Land of Wind was dangerous at the best of times. So instead, we were going to head to the north-west corner of the Land of Fire, cut through River Country there, and then head west.</p><p>It was a trip that would take us three and a half, maybe four days depending on how hard we pushed.</p><p>"Yeah," Naruto agreed. "Let's find a place to camp out. Man, I feel like I haven't seen a real bed in weeks."</p><p>He probably hadn't, depending on how they'd slept on the last mission.</p><p>We found a flat clearing with cover that we agreed upon, even if it took a bit of poking to get Sai to deem it 'acceptable'. It wasn't so much that he didn't like the place, it was just that didn't seem to recognise he needed to contribute an opinion after the Team Leader had made a decision.</p><p>"What, you don't like it, or something?" Naruto asked, piling wood together to make a fire. "We got cover, exits, and there's a little river down that way a bit."</p><p>Sai blinked. "I don't feel anything about it, one way or the other. Emotions are a hindrance to a ninja."</p><p>Naruto scoffed and crossed his arms. "That's a load of crap. How can you act if you don't feel anything at all?"</p><p>"I follow orders." Sai smiled.</p><p>I looked carefully at him. This was… okay, this was a lot deeper than I thought we were going to get so fast. Maybe not into <em> why</em> he was here, but the issues of Sai himself?</p><p>I sat down next to him, carefully casual. "You don't feel anything at all, Sai?"</p><p>"No," he said. "Why would I?"</p><p>I hummed and tipped my head back to look at the sky through the trees. Now how did I handle this? "Sometimes," I started. "It's easier to be like that. Emotions <em> can</em> be a hindrance to a ninja, but they can also be really beneficial. They might stop you from completing a mission, but they might also give you an extra reason why you <em> should</em> complete a mission even if it seemed like it was beyond your capabilities."</p><p>"What she said," Naruto agreed. "There've been a lot of times when I've been scared, but <em> so what?</em> My friends needed me, so it didn't matter that I was scared. The bonds I have with them, the need to defend my precious people, that was what made me <em> really</em> strong."</p><p>"Are you implying that I'm scared? I'm not," Sai objected quietly, calmly. "I just don't feel anything at all."</p><p>Not the right track to take, then. I reconsidered. There was something almost <em> fragile</em> about him, which I hadn't expected to see. Not when I thought of him as being so dangerous to me. But to bring this up so quickly, to reach out so fast to people he didn't know or trust himself…</p><p>Either Sai was playing us so well, or this was something that was so often at the top of his thoughts.</p><p>"Have you ever been hit with a flashbang?" I asked, keeping my tone a little detached so it didn't sound like a threat. "You know, afterwards? After all the light and sound has faded, you still can't see or hear, because you were so overwhelmed with it. It can take a little while for it to come back. Emotions can be like that too."</p><p>Sai tilted his head. "That would assume I once suffered enough emotion to render me 'blind'," he said.</p><p>"Did you?" I asked, still calm, still detached. It was an offer, not a push.</p><p>His eyes drifted towards his bag, but he said nothing more.</p><p>Naruto was watching us, arms still crossed, still scowling. But his eyes were trained on my face, and when I flicked my eyes towards the direction of the river, he nodded. "I'm going to go catch some fish to eat, okay? You guys get the campsite ready." He disappeared into the trees, before pausing to holler, "and make the fire!"</p><p>Maybe I should have left Sai to him, he was <em> better</em> at getting through to people, even if it normally involved shouting and punching. But I didn't really want to leave the two of them alone together.</p><p>Sai stood briskly and started getting things ready. I knelt down to fix the fire that Naruto had half way readied, and used a lighter to catch the kindling alight.</p><p>"It's okay, you know," I said quietly. "Whatever you feel or don't feel. It's even okay if you don't know."</p><p>"How could one not know?" Sai asked blandly. "That doesn't make any sense."</p><p>I gave him a small smile. "Feelings aren't always simple," I said. "Especially the big ones. See… for the two of us, right now… I could show you a stick just fine," I held one up, for demonstration. "Or even a tree. But how could I show you the forest? Or the Land of Fire? We're inside them. Maybe if we got distance, we would be able to, but right now, it's impossible."</p><p>Sai gave a bright, fake smile. "You really like to use metaphors, don't you?"</p><p>I laughed, and dropped the stick into the fire. "I guess I do," I said.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Stone Arc: Chapter 80</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 80</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> It's more humane to cure your enemies than to kill them. ~Hugh Mann</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"So this is it, huh?" Naruto said, as we curved around the pass that lead to Station One, the first town into the Land of Stone. The path in front of us curved and wiggled down the steep mountain side, but the village was cradled in a flat valley spread out before us. "It looks pretty rough."</p><p>I hummed. "We should probably check and see if Gosunkugi has been spotted in the area. Start with the hotels, maybe check out the bars and food markets? And maybe ask the local police if there have been any recent incidents – if he's not worried about keeping his head down, then he might have stolen something here too."</p><p>I wasn't entirely sure what kind of lead Tsunade had had that pointed here; it didn't say in the scroll, only that it was 'likely'.</p><p>"Okay." Naruto nodded, determinedly. Then he stopped and turned to his other side. "What do you think, Sai?"</p><p>Sai blinked. "I concur with this plan of action."</p><p>"Great!" Naruto clapped him on the shoulder with great enthusiasm. It was maybe a little over done, but not exactly <em> false</em> cheerfulness. Bull headed, stubborn cheerfulness, like the rest of his smiles, but not false.</p><p>Naruto it seemed, had not just accepted Sai as a pale, slightly weird, fellow ninja, but distinctly decided that he was a <em> friend.</em> A friend in need of a perpetual cheering squad, constant prodding and persistence, but a friend none the less.</p><p><em> He's going to feel so betrayed.</em></p><p>I looked down at the town below us, pretending to examine it.</p><p>If I said anything, Naruto would never let it lie. He would confront it – confront Sai – immediately.</p><p>"Hey," I said, throwing a teasing smirk at the boys. "First one to the village gets to pick where we stay tonight."</p><p>I stepped off the edge of the path and fell.</p><p><em> Oh, shit. Why did I think this was a good idea?</em></p><p>No, I wasn't falling. I anchored myself to the rock with <em> just</em> enough chakra to skim over the rock, like snowboarding without the board. Or snow.</p><p>Naruto shouted behind me, and a glance over my shoulder told me that he was imitating me, chakra glowing blue around his ankles and throwing up a mess of dust.</p><p>I grinned, adrenaline burst fading from 'mind numbing terror' to 'pleasant thrill', and slid my stance out so that it really was like I was snowboarding. I picked up speed, wind whipping through my hair as I careened down a nearly seventy degree slope.</p><p>Then Sai plunged past me, not slipping down the mountain, just falling. I nearly leapt out to catch him, but noticed, last second that he had a scroll out and was drawing on it in freefall. A huge bird burst out of the page, swept underneath him and delivered him lightly to the ground.</p><p>I increased the chakra in my feet as we neared the ground, bracing my legs against the increased stress and slowing my speed. At the last minute I jumped off, flipping and hitting the ground rolling to bleed off the rest of it, before popping to my feet.</p><p>I laughed, exhilarated, and threw my arm around Sai's shoulder. "Hurry up, slowpoke!" I shouted at Naruto. "Do we have to wait for you all day?"</p><p>He crashed into the ground moments later, landing a little gracelessly on hands and knees, but unharmed. "Hey! You're both cheaters!"</p><p>I poked my tongue at him. "I can't hear you over the sound of how long you took~!"</p><p>Naruto puffed out his cheeks. "You lost too! Serves you right for cheating first."</p><p>Sai shifted a little awkwardly beside me. Clearly too much contact. I dropped my arm and stepped away, turning to head for the village.</p><p>We headed to the main hotel first, mostly because it was the most obvious building in the main street. It looked like the ground floor was a bar instead of a reception anyway, so it was probably an important locale to check out.</p><p>"What's that?" Naruto asked, puzzled, as we stopped at the huge notice board right next to the front doors. "There's a picture of Gosunkugi."</p><p>"A bounty posting," Sai said.</p><p>"Land of Stone doesn't have a ninja village," I explained to Naruto as he continued to look confused. "So, when there is a criminal who has evaded the local police, they can't easily hire a ninja to bring him in. Instead, they just put up a bounty, and whoever finds him and turns him in can claim the reward. Kinda like a bingo book."</p><p>It wasn't exactly so straight forward – for one, plenty of other countries did bounties as well, and not always only on criminals. There were plenty of ninja that had money on their heads; Asuma-sensei for one had a bounty of 35 million ryo, or something. And bingo books were more like warnings than bounty postings.</p><p>"Oh," Naruto said. "So there might already be a lot of people looking for him, right? So they'd be able to tell us where to find him?"</p><p>"They wouldn't tell us," Sai countered. "Because they wish to claim his bounty themselves. They might even hinder us in our mission." He smiled.</p><p>I ignored the out of place expression. "It's a possibility," I allowed. "But not particularly worrying. Gosunkugi might be trying harder to hide if he knows so many people are looking for him, though."</p><p>"We'll find him," Naruto said, completely unworried. He turned away from the bounty board and pushed his way inside.</p><p>I shrugged and followed him. The inside was … okay, not just a <em> bar,</em> I was going to call it a saloon. I had noted that the architecture of the town seemed to be not just 'western' but 'old west', but this was really getting ridiculous.</p><p>Naruto made a bee-line for the counter and bartender, but Sai and I – with surprising synchrony – flared out behind him and scanned the room. For being mid-afternoon, there were a surprising number of people in here. A group of men playing cards at a round table, a couple drinking quietly, two separate men with cloaks and hats pulled low over their faces in the corners.</p><p><em> Not suspicious at all. Right.</em></p><p>"Hey, old man," Naruto said, amicably enough to the bartender. "We were hoping you could answer some questions."</p><p>It was a tossup whether it was the greeting, or if the guy just had a naturally surly disposition. He glared. "If you ain't buying anything, then beat it."</p><p>Naruto slid onto a barstool. "We're looking for this guy," he said, putting the picture of Gosunkugi down on the bar. "Has he been here?"</p><p>"Hah," the barkeep said, leaning back and crossing his arms. He didn't even look at the picture. "You think you're a bounty hunter, kid? You've got no idea. Get the hell out of here and you might even survive."</p><p>Since Naruto was facing the bar, I turned around, leaning casually against it and facing the rest of the room.</p><p>Naruto scoffed. "You're the one who has no idea," he said, slapping his hand down on the bar. "Have you seen him or not?"</p><p>"I wouldn't tell you, even if I had," the bartender said.</p><p>One of the guys playing cards put down his hand. "What's this? A buncha kids think that they can be bounty hunters? What a joke. But you know, I'm a nice guy. I'll give you some advice. If you pay me."</p><p>I eyed him. Somehow, I didn't believe that the 'advice' would be worth the money. "Information first, money after," I said. "We'll pay what its worth."</p><p>"Oh yeah?" Naruto said eagerly. He turned around. "What is it?"</p><p>"Don't get messed up," the guy lunged forward, huge steps clearing the ground between the table and the bar, "in things that don't involve," he swung, one meaty fist heading on a collision course for Naruto's head, "YOU!"</p><p>Naruto caught it, barely shifting in his seat. "That's pretty crappy advice, yaknow," he said, frowning.</p><p>The rest of the guys at the table stood, dropping their cards. A couple of the chairs clattered to the ground in the rush. The man at the right back corner of the room twitched, arms shifting underneath the poncho cloak that covered him. Reaching for a weapon, no doubt.</p><p>"Manaka Michizou," Sai said suddenly. He smiled. "Your picture was on the bounty board outside. Fifty thousand ryo, was it?"</p><p>About the same as a D-rank mission. Or a low C-rank, if you wanted to be generous. He might have been dangerous – all the people in the room were carrying knives or machete or even rough swords – but he wasn't anywhere near the league of a ninja. Even a Genin.</p><p>It was clear that no one in the room was, because not a single person had looked down to notice that the shadows on the floor were darker than they should be.</p><p>I was confident but I wasn't stupid.</p><p>"Only small time," Sai concluded.</p><p>"What'd you say?" Manaka roared, pulling back to turn on Sai. He stalled as his fist failed to budge in Naruto's grip.</p><p>"So you're a crook, too, huh?" Naruto said, contemplatively. "What'd you do?"</p><p>Manaka didn't answer, arm muscles bulging as he tried to wrench his fist out of the lazy grip Naruto had on it.</p><p>"Cattle rustling," said the man in the corner, tilting his wide brimmed hat back a fraction, to reveal a face cut with scars. So far he'd seemed perfectly at ease with the brewing fight – not even moving for his weapon. "And some petty thievery. He also has a habit of getting into bar brawls, but that ain't even considered a crime round these here parts."</p><p>Of all the people in the room, I would have put him as the most dangerous.</p><p>Apart from us.</p><p>"Let Michi go, you little brat," one of Manaka's friends snarled, drawing a machete out of his belt. The blade was rough, and I suspected it was used a lot more for actually chopping wood and… things… than it was for fighting. A tool, not a weapon.</p><p>"No fighting in here!" The barkeep shouted, a little frantically. "Take it outside."</p><p>"There won't be any fighting, will there, pal?" Our informant said, directing it towards the man with the weapon.</p><p>"You bet there will, <em> pal,</em> " the man snarled back.</p><p>The man with the hat <em> moved.</em> He had some respectable speed, slipping around the table and using the hilt of his – oh yes, he had an actual <em> sword</em> – to knock the man out. An equally quick blow to the sternum took out his neighbour, and the third man fell in quick succession.</p><p>Naruto twisted the hand he was holding, forcing Manaka down into a very simply arm lock in effort to avoid having it dislocated.</p><p>"There you are, sir," the man said, tilting his hat at the barkeep. "No fighting."</p><p>I laughed.</p><p><em> Suspicious. But funny.</em></p><p>"How about we drop these guys off at the sheriff's?" he continued, turning to us. "I don't think you're going to get any answers here."</p><p>Naruto shrugged. "Sure thing, old guy. You're pretty quick on your feet."</p><p>I stepped behind him, like I was just pushing off the bar. When my hands were out of sight, I twisted them into the Rat Seal.</p><p><em> Shadow Possession Complete.</em></p><p>"To the Sheriff's," I said, and took another step forward. The three unconscious men got to their feet. Naruto let Manaka go, turning to pick up the photo he'd slapped on the counter, and the crook followed my movements.</p><p>I walked out the door.</p><p>It took a little bit of quick stepping and spatial awareness to get all four of them outside without crashing anyone into a wall, but it wasn't exactly complicated.</p><p>Okay, so there wasn't <em> really</em> any need for the drama, or to hide that we were ninja or anything. But the wide eyes of the rest of the bar had been pretty damn gratifying.</p><p>And it wasn't like I wanted to carry them or anything. This was just easier.</p><p>"That's… a neat trick you got there," the man with the hat said, a little weakly. "The sheriff's is this way."</p><p>"Who are you, anyway?" Naruto asked. "Why'd you step in like that?"</p><p>"The name is Sazanami," the man said. "I'm a bounty hunter. I remember what it was like when I was starting out, so I thought I should give you a hand. I guess you didn't need it, though." Even from beneath the hat, I could see the apprehensive glance he gave the four men walking under my power.</p><p>"Ehehe," Naruto laughed, folding his hands behind his head. "We're not really bounty hunters," he explained. "We're ninja from Konoha. But we are looking for this one guy – so I guess you could say we're temporary bounty hunters."</p><p>"Ninja, huh?" Sazanami said. "I've met a few before, but none who weren't old enough to shave." He ran a thumb over his own chin. "But I guess that makes sense. If you were bounty hunters, you'd know that that wasn't really the way to go about asking – crime makes for a pretty insular community, they don't really like to share things with strangers."</p><p>Surprisingly, Naruto's straightforward way of asking things seemed to work more often than it didn't, in situations where it probably shouldn't. It wasn't the way I would have gone about it, for sure, but it wasn't a bad tactic to take either. And it was a good gauge of the town and what we had to work with.</p><p>"So have <em> you</em> seen this guy?" Naruto asked. "His name is Gosunkugi."</p><p>"Oh. There's the Sherriff's office," Sazanami said, in one of the worst deflections ever.</p><p>I resisted the urge to roll my eyes, and walked the posse inside.</p><p>"Manaka Michizou and companions," I announced, to the poor stunned sheriff, who probably wasn't used to criminals walking into his office. I let the shadow possession fade, and three of them collapsed to the ground. Manaka took a step back, as if to try escape, then toppled over with Naruto's foot planted firmly on his back.</p><p>Sazanami slipped inside, stepped around the pile of bodies, and handed the guy a flyer. "They here to collect the bounty."</p><p>"Right," the Sheriff agreed weakly. "I see."</p><p>The process was a little interesting, but took way too long. Konoha was much more efficient at handling prisoners.</p><p>"You should take it," Naruto said fairly. "You did most of the work." He held the envelope of cash out to Sazanami.</p><p>The bounty hunter shrugged. "It's fine. I wouldn't feel right taking money from kids, even if you are ninja. Besides, I've had a pretty good run lately."</p><p>"So, Gosunkugi," I prompted, to see Sazanami's eyes flicker to the side.</p><p>"That's a dangerous man," Sazanami said. "You might have been able to handle thugs like Manaka, but Gosunkugi is in a whole different league."</p><p>The warning was useless – a bounty hunter like Sazanami had no idea what kind of strength a ninja had, and unless Gosunkugi turned out to be a secret member of Akatsuki…</p><p>I was pretty sure he was not –</p><p>… or otherwise a missing ninja, or so on, then we could handle it.</p><p>"He's an unrepentant murderer," Sazanami continued. "He's killed dozens of people, just for the sake of robbing their corpses. He even killed an innocent family, just for the chance to steal some money."</p><p>I tilted my head to the side. Interesting.</p><p>"Did you know them?" Naruto asked, also homing in on that line. He had a sense of what was important to people.</p><p>Sazanami blinked. "What makes you say that?" he asked, caught off guard.</p><p>Naruto shrugged. "I don't know. It just seems like you did."</p><p>Because why mention the family? If there were dozens of people… what made the family stand out, above the rest? If he was doing it to scare us, then he would mention the most horrifying, or the one that involved people most similar to us. Mention kids, or the fates of the bounty hunters that had come after him before, or the way he always escaped.</p><p>Sazanami sighed. "Not well," he said, pulling his hat low, and shading his face. "Look, kids. I'm also looking for Gosunkugi, to bring him to justice. I don't want you getting in my way out there. You should just go home."</p><p>Naruto glared and crossed his arms. "Well, maybe we don't want you getting in our way," he shot back. "This is our mission and we're not going to quit!"</p><p>Sazanami smirked, slightly mockingly. "Well then," he said. "I guess that's it. May the best man win."</p><p>He turned and strode away. I narrowed my eyes at his retreating back. "Naruto. Spider."</p><p>Naruto nodded, a puff of smoke forming into a spider over his hand. He flicked it towards the bounty hunter, a small black spot sailing unnoticeably through the air. Sazanami never detected the bug clinging to his back.</p><p>That was one lead available to us.</p><p>"Shall we continue searching?" I asked.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Sai decided – using the 'winner' prize from this morning at much prodding from the rest of us – that we were camping out tonight. Given that there was a town <em> right there</em> it was a little bit of an odd choice, but then, I wasn't entirely confident the hotels would be bed-bug free either.</p><p>"Are you worried that we have not found a lead yet?" Sai asked as we set out camp.</p><p>"Nah," Naruto said, shrugging. "There's plenty more places to look. Besides, Sazanami seemed pretty certain that he was in the area."</p><p>He hadn't said as much, but he'd admitted to be looking for the guy. And if he was as good at what he did as he seemed to be, then that was a big hint in and of itself.</p><p>"Even if he's not in this town," I said. "There are a few more we can check out before we start to worry. Unless he heads north into Land of Rock…" I shrugged.</p><p>Whether or not we followed him then would depend on the circumstances. Unless we had a strong lead, it probably wouldn't be worth risking running into Rock shinobi on their own turf.</p><p>"I see." Sai looked pensive, then smiled. It was even more forced than his normal look. And that was saying something. "You would not be concerned if he headed south. The Land of Wind is familiar to you."</p><p>"Sure," Naruto said. "We were there a little while ago."</p><p>I leant back, hands flat on the ground, and watched. <em> What is it, Sai?</em></p><p>"I have heard about that mission."</p><p>Naruto chuckled. "Ehe, well, I guess it was a big thing," he said awkwardly.</p><p>"An S-rank mission is very impressive," Sai prompted. "Can you tell me about it?"</p><p><em> Is that what you're after?</em></p><p>Sure, Danzo had been interested in the Gelel – had mistakenly called it a 'weapon'. But he didn't think that Naruto would spill classified information, did he? If that meeting in the Hokage's office had truly gone through then maybe but not here, not in the field, to someone who shouldn't know.</p><p>"Well, some of it is classified," Naruto demurred. "But when we were in Land of Rivers…" he started to spin the non-classified parts into a story, seeming gratified at the way Sai was drinking it in.</p><p>I kept a careful ear on just how much detail was being shared. But there was no point that I felt the need to step in and silence him.</p><p><em> Or is the story a bonus? Are you after Naruto?</em></p><p>Not wholly, or completely. Naruto couldn't vanish without a lot of questions being raised. But if he was wondering if Naruto could be <em> controlled</em> …</p><p><em> Too much speculation.</em> I didn't know.</p><p>"And now there's a forest there, and stuff," Naruto finished, scratching his neck. "It's not a desert anymore."</p><p>That part didn't make any sense if you didn't know about the Gelel or the natural energy, but those parts of the tale <em> were</em> classified.</p><p>"A forest?" Sai asked. "It was created? Like… Wood Release?"</p><p>"The First Hokage's ability?" Naruto frowned. "A little bit, I guess? I don't really know. They weren't Hashirama trees, though, if that's what you're asking."</p><p>That… was an <em> excellent</em> assumption, even if it was completely and utterly wrong. "It would be interesting if there were people out there with the First Hokage's bloodlimit, wouldn't it?" I mused out loud.</p><p>If Sai really was reporting in to Danzo about this, then a little misdirect like this wouldn't hurt. The further from the truth he was, the better. And it wasn't like there were any mysterious Senju-like figures for him to find, even if he did start searching.</p><p>"Yeah!" Naruto grinned. "That would be pretty cool. I bet they'd be really strong."</p><p>"I see," Sai said, almost pensively. "That is very interesting."</p><p>We set a watch, but I slept lightly anyway. I didn't entirely trust Sai to take his without incident. Oh, I didn't think he would let us be attacked – but he could get up to a lot of things while the rest of us were unaware.</p><p>Therefore, I was awake when Naruto surged out of bed. "Sazanami found him!" Naruto blurted out, getting his legs tangled in his sleeping roll and nearly falling over. He hopped, impatiently, and shook them away.</p><p>I slid out of bed with a little more grace. "Where?"</p><p>"Not far," Naruto said, squinting into the night. "There's a valley to the west of the town…"</p><p>I rolled my sleeping roll up, quickly and efficiently, and sealed it away. Sai was moving too, packing up his gear, and we dismantled the campfire and buried the ashes.</p><p>"Here, take these," I said, pulling three square tags out of my pouch. "They LED's – lights. Channel chakra into them and they'll work."</p><p>They were stronger than the version that I'd used in my <em> other</em> seal, but not much more than a good light bulb. The need to constantly channel chakra was both an upside and downside – you'd have to keep concentrating on it, but we could stop and start it easily at will, which could come in really handy in some situations. Like if we needed to sneak up on a fight in progress.</p><p>"A torch." Naruto nodded. He held it uncertainly for a minute before grinning and tucking it into the front of his headband. He had to concentrate, but after a second, the light blinked on.</p><p>I turned my eyes away. "Jeeze, ruin my night vision, why don't you?" But it wasn't a bad idea – it kept his hands free and provided good light – as long as he could keep it going. Maybe I could affix the seal to his actual headband, in future.</p><p>We followed his lead to the fight, but it was well over by the time we got there. The 'valley' was a narrow channel, maybe a dried out river bed, with high walls on either side. It was almost a perfect spot for an ambush. I wondered who had ambushed who, because it was clear there had been a fight. There were senbon – no, nails, so that was where the nickname came from – scattered over the ground, and Sazanami's sword lay forlornly discarded. Sai knelt to examine the footprints in the ground, but Naruto beckoned me to the side.</p><p>"Spider used a replacement jutsu to get him out of the way," he said. "But he still got pretty hurt."</p><p>"Show me," I ordered, taking mental stock of what was in my medical kit. I slapped my LED to my forehead and used chakra to both stick it there and light it up.</p><p>Naruto scaled the wall easily, taking me to an outcropping that had been hidden from view from below. Sazanami was flat on his back, breathing shakily and in obvious pain, but it wasn't as bad as it first looked. He'd obviously managed to block or deflect whatever was aimed at vital points, and I was confident that I could treat the rest.</p><p>I'd had practice. Nails weren't too different from senbon, even if Haku hadn't aimed his with intent to kill.</p><p>"I didn't give Spider a lot of chakra," Naruto said, sounding almost upset. "It sent the memories, but then it didn't have enough to fight."</p><p>"You got him out," I said, as calmly and confidently as I could. "He's fine. I can heal him, and then we'll go after Gosunkugi."</p><p>"That man…" Naruto clenched his fist. "He's a real nasty piece of work."</p><p>"We'll go after him," I repeated. I laid a glowing green hand on Sazanami's forehead, sending my chakra to measure the damage and numb the pain. "Go help Sai, okay? See if there are any clues down below."</p><p>I didn't exactly want Sai and Naruto off alone together, but Naruto was upset, and this wasn't exactly going to be pretty.</p><p>Grimly, I took hold of the first nail and pulled it out.</p><p>It squelched.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"There is a group of five travelling west," Sai remarked, landing on the ledge behind me. It wasn't a big space, and with four of us there it was getting crowded. "They're undoubtedly heading to Station Two. We can catch them before they arrive." He looked unconcerned with everything that had happened tonight. I didn't really expect anything else from him.</p><p>Naruto nodded, almost absently. "Is Sazanami awake?" he asked me, peering over my shoulder. "Oh, hey! Are you okay?"</p><p>Sazanami stopped staring at my glowing hands – finally – and gave him a shaky nod. "I am. How… how did you get here?"</p><p>Naruto grinned sheepishly. "Well, uhm," he dragged out. "You see…"</p><p>"You were our best lead on Gosunkugi," I said softly, which was the truth but not the whole truth. 'How' was a little tidbit I wanted to keep under wraps.</p><p>"He kicked your ass pretty bad," Naruto said with utter bluntness. I nearly cringed. "Why's it so important for you to catch him?"</p><p>Sazanami took a deep breath. "Well, I guess I owe you an explanation," he said, reluctantly.</p><p>I finished healing the last of his injuries and sat back. Medical jutsu weren't <em> incredibly</em> chakra intensive by nature, but there had been a lot of small injuries and it had taken me a long time, so it had used a fair portion. I could still fight, but I'd have to watch it.</p><p>"Years ago," Sazanami started. "I was a swordsmith." He touched the handled of the sword that Naruto had retrieved for him. "I lived in a small village, but people would travel fair distances so that I would forge a weapon for them. I think some of them were even ninja, but they rarely said anything about it. It was… a good life." He sighed. "It was the day of the festival. I was delivering a sword to a customer when I walked past a house that had its doors left wide open. I thought it was a little unusual, so I stopped to see what was happening. I fought him," he said. "But it was already too late. The family was dead. And I was no match for him. He escaped."</p><p>"Gosunkugi," Naruto confirmed.</p><p>Sazanami nodded. "I told everyone what had happened, but they didn't believe me. They said I was the only person not at the festival and… I was carrying a weapon. They wouldn't listen to reason. I ran," he admitted. "Became a fugitive. I swore that I would bring Gosunkugi to justice, so that they would know the truth."</p><p>Running might not have helped him much, I thought, in appearing innocent. But that would depend on which country he had been in, and what the justice process was like there. I couldn't make that judgement.</p><p>"So you became a bounty hunter to clear your name," Naruto concluded. "That's why it's so important to you."</p><p>"This is irrelevant to our mission," Sai interrupted. "We should begin our pursuit of the criminal. It will become more difficult if he reaches the next station."</p><p>Naruto nodded firmly. "Right. We should go." He raced through a set of hand seals. "Summoning Jutsu; Gamanori!"</p><p>"Naruto!" I protested, leaping up to stand on the wall. "Careful!"</p><p>Gamanori was only small when you compared him to the other summons of the toad contract. He was big enough to ride, and the toad that Naruto frequently summoned when he wanted to do so.</p><p>"Hey," the toad said, not seeming at all to mind that he was being summoned in an awkward locale. "You need a ride?"</p><p>"Not me, but Sazanami does," Naruto explained, jerking a thumb over his shoulder. "He got kinda beat up, but we need to move fast, okay?"</p><p>The toad shrugged, which looked … odd on an amphibian. "You're the boss," he deferred.</p><p>Sazanami appeared to decide he had been shocked enough for one night, and gamely raised one hand to lift his hat. "Pleasure to meet you."</p><p>Sai was almost frowning. "Why did you do that?"</p><p>Naruto blinked. "Well, if we have to move fast, then he's not going to be able to keep up with us," he said logically. "But Gamanori can."</p><p>"We don't have to bring him with us. We know where Gosunkugi is," Sai pointed out. I wouldn't quite have called it 'arguing' but there was some definite tension there.</p><p>"We have to clear his name," Naruto said, as though it had already been decided. In his mind, it probably had. "So of course he has to be there with us."</p><p>"That wasn't our mission," Sai said. He glanced at me, frustrated. Clearly hoping I would intervene.</p><p>"The two are not entirely mutually exclusive," I said calmly. True, it would be much more difficult, but… not impossible.</p><p>Sazanami's reasoning was not a bad one. And, okay, I really wanted to see how Sai reacted to something off script like this.</p><p>"It's pointless," he said. "We should focus on our mission."</p><p>"This is our mission," Naruto argued, crossing his arms. "It's all the same in the end – we just have to catch Gosunkugi!"</p><p>"You can't… change the mission." Poor Sai. He sounded so bewildered. In a flat, monotone way.</p><p>"I'm not changing the mission," Naruto denied. "I'm, uh, I'm making a field command decision, based on new information to, uhm, to-"</p><p>"Update our objectives?" I supplied. "To ensure that all loose ends are appropriately dealt with and will cause no future issues?"</p><p>"That," Naruto agreed with a nod.</p><p>"The- The Hokage won't like it," Sai said, and now I knew his arguments were becoming desperate. I wondered what he'd been about to say first, before he'd changed it.</p><p>"Why not?" Naruto asked, honestly puzzled. To be fair, he had brought home at least two borderline enemy ninja to the village and had them folded in. This wouldn't even rate on the list of things he thought Tsunade would be upset about.</p><p>"I don't think she'll mind as much as you suspect," I said dryly. "And anyway, she's too far away to ask – that's why shinobi are authorised to make field decisions. You're a Chunin; surely you've had a mission where you had to make a judgement call?"</p><p>Sai withdrew. There was no other word for it.</p><p>Maybe the last question had been going too far. I doubted he ever had been able to make a judgement call in the field, not truly. Not without it being exactly what Danzo would have wanted anyway.</p><p><em> Poor kid.</em></p><p>"Let's go," Naruto said impatiently, when Sai didn't argue anymore. "We need to catch this guy."</p><p>We headed out, running down the wall and following the curve of the pathway towards the next town. Gamanori kept pace with us easily, landing in surprisingly quiet thumps for such a large creature.</p><p>Honestly, some part of me expected Gosunkugi to lose us, or to reach the next town. It just seemed like a thing that would happen. But he was a man travelling on foot, who expected to have a whole night to get where he was going.</p><p>And we were ninja on a mission.</p><p>"I sense him," I breathed.</p><p>We slid to a halt.</p><p>"There's five men," I said, concentrating. "One of them has moderate chakra levels, the others are no higher than civilians." I'd pick that the one <em> with</em> chakra was Gosunkugi, and that his rapid firing nails were some kind of jutsu. We'd have to watch out for that.</p><p>"Okay, Shikako, you go right. Sai, you go left. I'll jump down and get him."</p><p>It was a very simple plan. Basic pincer movement, with Naruto providing a head on attack and distraction. But simple wasn't bad.</p><p>Sazanami slid down off the toad. "Wait. I can help."</p><p>Naruto grinned, a little feral. "Nah, don't worry. We got this."</p><p>I nodded to him, then split off to circle around, sensing Sai do the same in the other direction. The sun wasn't up yet, but if I could get into position and get some light going, then they still wouldn't be able to evade my shadows.</p><p>"Hey, Gosunkugi!" Naruto shouted, voice breaking the dark stillness of the air like a glass shattering on the ground. "I've got something to say to you!"</p><p>I rolled my eyes. He couldn't have waited another minute, could he?</p><p>I cut my wide circle short, instead aiming for a rocky outcropping closer to the group.</p><p>I was close enough to hear the low mutter of 'so who is this brat' and I crouched down, pressing my hand to the rock and setting a seal, just in case.</p><p>"You're under arrest!" Naruto shouted down at the group. "For being a thief! And for hurting my friend!" He was standing out in full view, silhouetted against the moon. He couldn't have made himself a better target if he tried.</p><p>Ah. Of course.</p><p>"I don't have time to waste on the likes of you," Gosunkugi said, utterly dismissive. He took a single nail out of his pocket, and flicked it to the ground. "Torpedo Nails!"</p><p>It seemed to be a derivative of the Shadow Clone Kunai jutsu, multiplying one into a storm of many.</p><p>I wondered if Gosunkugi had had ninja training, but that wasn't the sort of thing that would be left out of our mission briefing. If he had, then it was well buried. He wasn't a missing nin. Chakra and related skills weren't entirely the province of ninja, no matter what we might have liked to think – Jako hadn't been a ninja either, and he'd still got us into trouble with that sticky chakra of his.</p><p>The nails soared towards Naruto, a lethal net of spikes.</p><p>He burst into smoke.</p><p>The real Naruto dropped down from above – just like he said he would – and landed feet first on Gosunkugi's face.</p><p>"Lighting Release: Radiating Shockwave," I called, because it was a good area of effect jutsu. It struck the four accomplices, arching along the metal swords they carried, and making them drop. Then Sai's ink beasts were on them, and they were out of the fight.</p><p>All in all… it had taken about a second. It was probably the easiest fight I'd ever been in.</p><p>I waited for another beat, just to make sure that there was no last minute save and retaliation, and they weren't faking us out, and then scuffed a foot over my seal and cancelled it.</p><p>Naruto was frowning down at the criminals. He looked up at me and scratched his neck. "Was that it?" he asked, sounding honestly a little puzzled. He nudged the unconscious body with his foot.</p><p>I shrugged. "I guess so."</p><p>Sai faded into sight. "Targets nullified, taicho," he said stiffly.</p><p>Naruto looked around once more, still seeming disappointed. "Right, well okay. Let's get these guys to the sheriff."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered.</em> <em> ~ G. K. Chesterton</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The stranger blocked our path.</p><p>He was tall and heavy set, with a thick and wild looking beard. He was dressed in a red poncho, and carrying an axe. The gates of Station Two loomed large behind him. We couldn't get to them without going through him.</p><p>He looked distantly familiar and it took a moment to place him as the <em> other</em> mysterious figure from the saloon in Station One.</p><p><em> He must have come straight here to make it ahead of us.</em></p><p>We drew to a halt.</p><p>"What's the big deal?" Naruto demanded. He threw out a hand to halt Gamanori, who was placidly hopping along with our prisoners piled onto his back.</p><p>Sazanami dropped his hand to the hilt of his sword.</p><p>A gust of wind blew past, flapping our clothes. A lone tumbleweed blew past.</p><p>"Tokichi," the stranger rasped. "You're under arrest."</p><p>Naruto squinted at him. "Who's Tokichi?"</p><p>The tension shattered. Sazanami coughed awkwardly. "That's me," he said. "He's after my bounty."</p><p>"Oh," Naruto realised. "That's okay, the whole thing is just a big mistake! Sazanami didn't really do it, and we caught the guy that did, so everything is sorted now." He folded his hands behind his head and grinned. "Wait until you hear the whole story, it's kind of a doozy."</p><p>The bounty hunter looked at him, seeming just a <em> little</em> put out by the change in script.</p><p>I smothered a smile.</p><p>"We're going to the sheriff's office now," I offered politely. "If you'd like to join us."</p><p>It wasn't that I thought we couldn't fight him… but if there was no need, then there was no need.</p><p>"What's your name, anyway?" Naruto asked. "Are you a bounty hunter? Were you after Gosunkugi too?"</p><p>He started walking, expecting the man to fall into step with us on the way to deliver the prisoners.</p><p>There was a moment of hesitation, where I thought that the bounty hunter would still try <em> something,</em> then he shook his head and turned.</p><p>"Gatsu," he said. "Yes. Yes." He paused. "That's an … interesting looking horse you have there."</p><p>Naruto gave him a weird look. "It's not a horse. He's a toad."</p><p>Gatsu gave him a look that was so bland it spoke volumes.</p><p>We made an odd procession, walking down the streets of Station Two. This town seemed a lot more lively than the last one, brighter and more well off, with a nice collection of temples and shrines.</p><p>"Ah, it's the ceremony of the Golden Bell," Sazanami said, after a loud tolling noise had cut through the air. "It's a shame to miss it."</p><p>"The what?" Naruto said, settling back down after it turned out not to be an attack.</p><p>I admit that I had jumped too.</p><p>"The main temple has a giant bell made of gold," Sazanami explained. "It's the center piece to the festival. They move it from the temple out to the belfry for a day, so that people can see it and admire it." He squinted upwards, tilting his hat back. "I've heard a legend that it was a key item in the last war, used to defend the border. But I think that's just a story."</p><p>I looked at Naruto and shrugged. "There are weirder things," I said, though maybe we could check it out after.</p><p>"Do you think that's what that guy was after?" Naruto wondered, jerking a thumb at the criminals. "A giant bell made of gold has to be worth a lot?"</p><p>"An item so famous and unique would be difficult to sell without notice," Sai criticised. "Regardless of how much money it was worth."</p><p>It was a valid point. Assuming that Gosunkugi wasn't vain enough to want to do it anyway, simply because the thing existed. He <em> had</em> stolen from the Tea Country court, so it wasn't like he was afraid of retaliation.</p><p>Which was a bit of a mistake on his part, frankly. He'd taken things from people who had the ability to hire ninja to get them back, and so here we were.</p><p>"Well whatever," Naruto said. "There's no chance of it happening now."</p><p>The next step of the mission – depositing the prisoners at the police station and acquiring a confession to both Sazanami's story and the theft – went slightly less smoothly. For one, although he was there willingly, Sazanami was also taken in to custody.</p><p>"I expected it," he said, and relinquished his sword to us rather than the police. "Please look after this for me."</p><p>Naruto took it, slightly awkwardly. "You bet! I'll keep it safe for you."</p><p>Gatsu watched, hawkeyed, as Sazanami was led through the hallway where the prisoners were kept.</p><p>"I didn't expect him to go," he admitted. "It has been a long chase to catch him."</p><p>I didn't point out that Sazanami had hardly been <em> caught</em> at all. He looked thoughtful, and I wondered if he was considering the likelihood we were telling the truth about the true criminal. At this stage, his opinion didn't really matter.</p><p>"Yes," I repeated, to the police officer who had taken the other prisoners, for about the tenth time. "We require information from Gosunkugi about a crime committed in the Land of Tea. We will need to question him."</p><p>"I can't allow that," the sheriff said. "There is no access to prisoners without authorisation."</p><p>"I have the authorisation of the Village Hidden in the Leaves," I corrected. "As a representative of the Land of Fire as granted by the Daimyo."</p><p>I wasn't one hundred percent sure that Land of Fire had a treaty with this place as to that effect but … 'I'm a ninja' was generally a pretty strong statement. Officially, ninja <em> were</em> representatives of their country of origin in a whole lot of ways. We were military, and we interacted with legislative branches in actual, legally obligated ways. Granted, ninja tended to bend 'legal' as far as it could go without breaking, if they didn't circumvent it altogether, but there was <em> some</em> official power behind it. We weren't (always) just renegades that ran around doing whatever we felt like.</p><p>He still seemed doubtful. I showed him my headband and ninja registration card.</p><p>"I'll have to inform the chief," he said at last, which was at least progress.</p><p>Even my patience was starting to wear a little thin. Naruto was starting to fidget.</p><p>"Maybe you can take Sai to scout the town?" I suggested. "See if there is anything going on, maybe pick up some breakfast?" We'd travelled all night, and it didn't look like we were going to be done here anytime soon. We'd done worse than skip a meal in the past, but there wasn't any need to push ourselves.</p><p>Naruto nodded thoughtfully. "Okay, you stay here with Gatsu and sort this out. We'll make sure that nothing else is happening."</p><p>I still wasn't confident in sending them away together, because time was ticking down if Sai was going to try something. I still had no idea <em> what</em> that might be.</p><p>"Keep an eye on each other," I suggested, trying to smile like it was a light-hearted admonishment. Naruto could take Sai if it came to an out-and-out fight, but Sai would be a fool to make it one.</p><p>I sank back into the visitor chairs to wait. Gatsu was leaning against the wall like an intimidating block of muscle and seemed disinclined to talk.</p><p>Maybe we'd made a mistake, handing Gosunkugi in before we'd questioned him. It wouldn't have been that much harder to wait until he woke up and then give him to the police.</p><p>But… I was a little leery about doing it that way.</p><p>All on our own, there were a lot of paths that we could have taken to get a man to talk. I didn't think Naruto would have allowed it, but how hard would it have been to send him away for half an hour, until we had the information we needed?</p><p><em> No. Definitely not. </em> This would be done properly, legally, and ethically.</p><p>"So, you're the ninja from Iwa?" The police chief said briskly, stopping to a halt in front of me. He was a tall man, wide shouldered, and wore his uniform with crisp practicality. There were streaks of grey in his hair, and wrinkles in the corners of his eyes, but he was not frail.</p><p>I straightened. There was a spark of intelligence in his eye that made me think the question itself was a trap. He wasn't a ninja, not unless he was good enough to completely present his chakra as civilian, but he clearly wasn't as unknowledgeable as the rest of the station.</p><p>"Konoha," I corrected with a smile. I pulled the coat of my sleeve until he could see the village symbol on the headband there. "Gosunkugi has also committed crimes to the south of here, so we were dispatched to arrest him."</p><p>"And you want to interrogate him," he said bluntly.</p><p>I tilted my head slightly. "Yes," I agreed, because we had to call a spade a spade. "We need to know where the item he stole is located. Also, there is another crime that is of interest to us. Several years ago, Gosunkugi murdered a family of three and framed our friend Tokichi for it. I'd rather like that matter to be settled."</p><p>His lips pulled down in a tight frown. "If that is the truth," he prevaricated.</p><p>"Yes," I agreed, since he seemed at least willing to consider the whole matter. Good that this wasn't the type of police that would consider any conviction better than none. Sazanami would have been in trouble if that were the case. But, he probably knew attitudes of the law here reasonably well, and would hardly have surrendered if justice was completely off the table.</p><p>I hoped.</p><p>"I will allow you to ask your questions," the chief began. "Under certain conditions. At no point will you be alone with the prisoner. At no point will the prisoner be harmed. You have no authority to make plea bargains. You have no authority to sentence the prisoner. At any point, the interrogation may be cancelled."</p><p>I considered it. That cut out several options – some of them, I was glad to see go – but still left some fairly wide margins around the edge. "I accept," I said, and hoped I knew what the hell I was doing.</p><p>Surely they had someone here whose job it was to ask prisoners questions? They <em> had</em> to investigate all these crimes.</p><p>Except that might take <em> weeks</em> and Tsunade would not be impressed with us in that case.</p><p><em> Nothing for it but to try.</em></p><p>Maybe I should have kept Naruto here to shout at him. That generally seemed to get people to spill.</p><p>"Very well," the police chief nodded. "I hope you are prepared. Gosunkugi has already been questioned and has been uncooperative. Follow me."</p><p>I fell into step, feeling a flash of wry amusement at the new information. Not only was Gosunkugi awake already, but they'd already started questioning him and they hadn't said.</p><p>Well played.</p><p>I felt Gatsu push off the wall and follow us as well. Well, whatever. If he wanted to loom menacingly, I wasn't going to complain.</p><p>The room that the chief led us to was plain. There was a single table, with Gosunkugi seated on one side. His hands were shackled and resting on the table, but didn't appear tied down.</p><p>There were two chairs opposite him. I paused in the doorway for a moment, observing, before choosing to sit down directly opposite him.</p><p><em> I need to make him want to talk.</em></p><p>I braced my elbows on the table and laced my fingers together. Gosunkugi had been stripped of the rich, almost formal clothes he had been wearing before, and was dressed in a simple prison overall. His hair was mussed, there were still smudges of dirty across his face, and he looked deeply disgruntled.</p><p>But not afraid. He looked like a man that was confident that he was going to get out of this.</p><p>His eyes flickered to the police chief, who sat down beside me, and to Gatsu, looming behind us.</p><p>This was a case where our quick combat worked against us. Gosunkugi didn't understand enough to be afraid of the real threat. It had happened too fast – he might not even know how he had gone from yelling at Naruto to the police station.</p><p>Despite the fact that there was no possibility of combat – and if there was, I would hardly be threatened – my mind was combat clear. I was aware of everyone in the room. I was aware of every potential weapon in the room, however bare it was.</p><p>I was aware of every shadow.</p><p>We were all sitting around the same table. The light was coming down from above.</p><p>I couldn't have created a better trap if I had planned it.</p><p>I could certainly use this.</p><p><em> Okay, let's do this.</em></p><p>Firstly, I tried something that I had never consciously done before. I gathered my chakra, and spread it through the air with a shiver of killing intent.</p><p>Sweat broke out on Gosunkugi's forehead.</p><p><em> I'll kill you,</em> I thought experimentally. It felt … flat. Empty. But how could I work up the passion of a fight over this? I wasn't afraid. I wasn't desperate. I didn't need to.</p><p>Yet-</p><p>Yet the most terrifying killing intent I had ever felt had not been at Zabuza's feet. It had not even been the wild, uncontrolled bloodlust of Gaara.</p><p>No. Terror had been Itachi and his sense of duty, willing to go so far for so little. Terror had been Orochimaru's dispassionate, cool gaze. The blinding, rising tide of it, swallowing everything. It had been his cold reptilian gaze that could kill you and simply… not notice.</p><p><em> I could kill you</em> , I thought, and layered it into my chakra.<em> If I needed to. And it would not be because I enjoyed it, or because I wanted to, it would simply be because you were in my way.</em></p><p>I felt distanced from myself, almost as if I had gone to shadow.</p><p>"Gosunkugi," I said coolly. "You're going to answer my questions."</p><p>He swallowed, nervously. His eyes were wide, pupils blown out with fear. There was a slight tremor to him, shaking the chains on his handcuffs with a metallic clacking noise.</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about," he bluffed. "I'm an innocent man. Officer, I was attacked by… by a young ruffian while I was on my way to visit this lovely town, you should invest more heavily into controlling the rabble-"</p><p>My brow creased slightly. That wasn't good.</p><p>Stage two, then.</p><p>I channelled some chakra into my shadow. It swelled beneath the table, spreading out to envelop all within it. I latched on to Gosunkugi's shadow.</p><p>He shuddered. The shaking stopped as he was immobilized, but his eyes started to roll. He was almost panting with fear.</p><p>I paused. That was a reaction greater than what I was going for. I'd been going to use the 'you can't even control your own body' as an intimidation tactic, certainly, but this was…</p><p><hr /></p><p>Shadow Possession was a spiritual connection. We used that to control the body, but right now I was emitting killing intent and it was going straight from my chakra to his. It no longer relied on him sensing it from the air around him.</p><p>Well. I could work with this.</p><p>I pulled on my shadow, like I was meditating, laying in on thicker and darker. "Gosunkugi," I repeated. "<strong> You're going to answer my questions.</strong> "</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Can I speak with Sazanami as well?" I asked, as we exited the interrogation room.</p><p>Gosunkugi had been mostly cooperative, shrill and terrified though he was. I wasn't entirely sure how I felt about that, but I had the information I was after and he had confessed to more than just framing Tokichi. I didn't think he would be seeing daylight for a very long time.</p><p>The police chief gave me a wary look. "Do you have questions for him as well?" he asked, a little dryly.</p><p>He and Gatsu hadn't felt the extra boost of the Shadow Possession, but I wasn't exactly expert enough at killing intent to direct it solely at one person. They'd probably caught a bit of that, though neither of them <em> looked</em> like they were badly off.</p><p>Actually out of the two, Gatsu looked worse off.</p><p>I was absolutely certain that the police chief had had dealings with ninja before.</p><p>"No," I said. "He's a friend. I just wanted to let him know that Gosunkugi had confessed." I gave him a friendly smile. I felt cold and distant inside, so it was a little difficult, but I put effort into it until it felt natural.</p><p>It didn't seem like he brought it, not truly, but he called one of the other officers over to escort me.</p><p><em> Even better</em> , I thought. It would have been tricky to have this conversation under his watchful eye. Easy to dismiss him as a 'civilian' simply because he wasn't a ninja – but that didn't mean he was <em> lesser.</em></p><p>"Shikako," Sazanami greeted politely. Like Gosunkugi, he was cuffed and wearing uniform, but his confidence was of a different sort. A little more nervous. A little more hopeful.</p><p>I smiled at him, sliding into the seat. "Good news," I said. "The police have his confession, and the police chief is going to take care of all the paperwork. They might keep you for a few days to clean up the loose ends and do a bit more investigating, but it looks like you'll be a free man soon."</p><p>Hopefully not much more than a few days, anyway. That was very fast for a legal process, so I thought it was a <em> little</em> optimistic, personally. Then again, maybe the chief just really, really wanted to get rid of us ninja.</p><p>Sazanami slumped in his chair. "Oh," he said, sounding dazed. "That's funny. I thought it would feel different."</p><p>I regarded him carefully. "You thought it would feel like before," I guessed.</p><p>He chuckled. "I guess it sounds silly when you put it like that. It's not like the truth would make the last few years just vanish."</p><p>"It doesn't change what's already happened," I agreed.</p><p>"No, it doesn't," Sazanami said. "But it's over. Finally, it's over."</p><p>"What are you going to do now?" I asked, curiously. "Stay a bounty hunter?"</p><p>"I don't know. I always thought that I would go back and start up as a sword smith again…" he looked pensive. "But I don't hate this life. And I don't know if I could live in a town that once believed the worst of me with no cause or reason."</p><p>Carefully, I dropped my hands beneath the table into my lap, and folded them through a set of handseals.</p><p>The genjutsu dropped lightly over the police officer beside me. To him, we merely kept talking in the same vein – light-hearted words between friends.</p><p>"You know, when we met in Station One, you said that there were special ways to get information on bounties," I said leadingly.</p><p>"I don't know if I would say 'special' ways," Sazanami said. "But you have to know what you're doing. Newcomers are easy to spot in a lot of ways. What you guys did was a pretty classic mistake." He looked thoughtful. "There is someone you're looking for, isn't there?"</p><p>I leant back in the chair, picking my words carefully. I had to be so, so careful here. This was important, but it couldn't sound it. Couldn't sound more meaningful than 'we met yesterday and maybe you can help me'.</p><p>Damn. This was a <em> terrible</em> idea.</p><p>"Yes and no," I said. "There is someone I'm looking for information on."</p><p>Sazanami glanced at the police officer, who was looking a little bored and not reacting to our conversation.</p><p>"He can't hear us," I clarified. "The conversation he can hear is filled with technical weapon terminology. More about the uses than the smithing, sorry." Okay, so 'light-hearted' in only a certain sense. But it was something we both could be expected to know, and probably a few levels of jargon higher than the poor officer could easily understand and remember. "Try to not make any huge exaggerated movements or anything, though."</p><p>It did cover sight as well – simple layering of what was already here with no differences – but the less I needed to change, the easier it was to keep going.</p><p>"Right, of course he can't." Sazanami ran a hand through his hair. "So you wanted me to keep an eye out at the bounty offices? You found Gosunkugi pretty quickly without them."</p><p>I hesitated. "The man I'm talking about," I said carefully, "is a very dangerous ninja who just also happens to be a bounty hunter. If you think about how easily we dealt with Gosunkugi… that's how easily this man would deal with us. The opponents he deals with have ten million ryo bounties."</p><p>"That's a little out of my league," Sazanami said.</p><p>"I know," I admitted. "I'm not asking you to do anything about him. Just… if you happened to notice that he had been around…"</p><p>It was also why I had waited until Gosunkugi <em> had</em> confessed to have this conversation. Sazanami was free. I didn't have anything to hold over him. Because it would have been so, so easy to say 'do this, or he might have an accident on the way to jail' or 'or we'll take him to Konoha and the truth will never come out'. And that was stupid and short term and <em> awful.</em></p><p>Cruel. It would have been cruel to blackmail someone into doing something so dangerous, would have built resentment and turn Sazanami against me totally, even if he did what I needed him to.</p><p>It sounded like something Danzo would do. And I didn't want to be that person.</p><p>"Someone like that must have done something pretty terrible," Sazanami said cautiously. He leant his elbows on the table. He looked… intrigued.</p><p>I supposed that was good.</p><p>"Yes," I said. "He's a criminal that even other ninja are scared of. And he works with a group made up of men that are the same or worse."</p><p>Sazanami blinked. "You know, I've never really considered the idea that ninja form gangs too. I don't think I should be as surprised as I am."</p><p>I smirked. "Yeah. It's not something that the villages like to let happen. So when it does happen, it can be pretty bad." I put my hands on the table, palms flat. "Look, I'm not asking you to doanything about them. I'm really, <em> really</em> not. I just wanted to know if there was a way to get information from bounty offices about them."</p><p>Sazanami nodded slowly. "I can keep an eye out. But I can't promise anything."</p><p>"Good," I said. "That's really the best…" I swallowed, aware that my palms were sweaty. I resisted the urge to rub them dry on my pants. "The bounty hunter is called Kakuzu. The group is called Akatsuki. And neither of those are things you should name drop. Ever. You should probably pretend I never told you them."</p><p>I gave him a quick rundown on them. It wasn't like I had much to share. And even giving him the name was… iffy. I didn't doubt that Jiraiya probably knew it but he hadn't told me. By rights, I shouldn't have even known it. If this worked out, then I could say I learnt it from Sazanami…</p><p><em> This is a terrible, terrible idea.</em></p><p>"Even the littlest piece of information would be helpful at this stage," I said. "Where he was, the bounty he turned in, who he was with… anything. I'm not asking for deep secrets."</p><p>"If I do find something," Sazanami said cautiously. "How do I tell you?"</p><p>I bit my lip, mind racing. "I'll give you something before we go," I said vaguely, settling on an idea. "But if you can't contact me, send it to Konoha care of the Nara Clan."</p><p>I gave us a few more minutes, and cancelled the genjutsu. "We'll come back and visit later!" I said cheerily. "Hopefully everything will be sorted by then."</p><p>Even though the conversation was over – and had gone well – my stomach was roiling with nerves. Now was the time for second guessing myself while it was too late to do anything about it.</p><p>We'd only known Sazanami for two days. We barely knew him at all. This was a lot of trust to put into someone. This was a dangerous situation to get someone involved in. This could go wrong in so, so many ways.</p><p><em> So. So. Terrible. What are you doing.</em></p><p>I paused just outside the police station, sensing Naruto and Sai on their way back. Gatsu had been waiting inside and had declined to come with us. I didn't quite know what he wanted – maybe he was concerned about knowing the truth about Sazanami. Maybe he just liked police stations.</p><p>"Hey, Shikako! We got you some mochi!" Naruto said cheerfully, passing me a tray. There were a few pieces missing. "Well, I got it for Sai but he doesn't like it."</p><p>"Thanks," I said dryly, but took it anyway. "Not a fan of sweets, Sai?"</p><p>"No," Sai said. He looked a little uncomfortable, but it was hard to tell.</p><p>"Fair enough". I shrugged. "What do you like to eat then?" I popped a piece of mochi into my mouth. It was good.</p><p>Sai considered the question with more weight than it probably deserved. But then again, I was asking him to declare a <em> preference</em> for something, so it might have been a big deal, after all.</p><p>"Tofu," he said, after a long pause. "Momen tofu."</p><p>"Bleh, tofu," Naruto said immediately, then backpedalled. "Well, it's okay in ramen. And if you like it, then that's okay too."</p><p>I passed him some mochi. "Did you see anything interesting while you were out?"</p><p>Naruto laughed awkwardly, holding Sazanami's sword closer to his side. "What makes you say that?"</p><p>I chewed, and raised an eyebrow at him. I <em> hadn't</em> meant anything by it, but that absolutely sounded like there was a story.</p><p>"I only put it down for a second," he protested. "And we got it back. So it's fine."</p><p>I looked at Sai. He said nothing.</p><p>Well. The village didn't look like it was on fire. No one was screaming and running around in chaos. He was in possession of Sazanami's sword.</p><p>"Okay," I said. "Why don't we go get some lunch then? Mochi is nice, but it's not real food."</p><p>It was a festival, so there were lots of vendors out in full force. Despite deciding on 'real food'… we kind of just snacked on things as we went.</p><p>"The bell is up here," Naruto said, winding us through the streets. "It's really big. Do you think it was actually used in the war?"</p><p>I eyed it. It was big. And gold. And loud. "Maybe," I said, because maybe someone used it for auditory genjutsu. Though all I really had was the vision of dropping it on someone's head, acme style. Maybe Minato's.</p><p>"You haven't heard about it?" Naruto asked, sounding disappointed.</p><p><em> So much faith in me</em> , I thought wryly. "Unfortunately, Konoha's war records tend to go 'and then the Yellow Flash showed up and the fighting was over'. Giant bells not included."</p><p>"Why is it important?" Sai asked. "Do you believe it is a weapon?" He was staring at the bell, as though assessing its viability as a weapon of mass destruction. He didn't look particularly impressed.</p><p><em> Says the man that fights with art.</em></p><p>"No, it just sounds awesome," Naruto said.</p><p>Well, it wasn't like we had anything else to do all day. It could be fun to do a little bit of sightseeing. "Maybe the shrines will have a history plaque?" I suggested. "We could check them out."</p><p>"Great idea!" Naruto enthused. "Let's go!"</p><p>There was some interesting things to be learnt from the shrines and temples, and the festive atmosphere kept the whole thing fun, even for Naruto who normally wasn't one for academic outings.</p><p>"Eh? What's this?" Naruto asked, staring up at a huge monolith in an isolated temple courtyard. The temple itself was on the outskirts of the village and quiet, even now. I half suspected it was closed, because it appeared fairly derelict, except that there was a monk sitting quietly on the cobblestones.</p><p>The monk coughed. "That is a memorial stone for all the shinobi that died defending the border."</p><p>"They're all names," I said, eyeing the hundreds of tiny kanji etched into the surface. There were so many.</p><p>The grin dropped off Naruto's face, to a look of solemnity. "This place really was a battlefield, wasn't it? Hey, old man. Can we buy some incense?"</p><p>We exchanged coins and lit the sticks at the altar. I went through the motions, noticing that Sai was even stiffer and more awkward here. No, I didn't imagine he got much of a chance to visit temples.</p><p>It wasn't that I really believed the incense would help the spirits of the dead, but it was a culturally significant action that conveyed respect, so it wasn't something I minded doing.</p><p>"I recognise that symbol," the old monk said to us. "You're from the Land of Fire, aren't you? Why light incense for people that your country killed?"</p><p>"What land do the dead belong to?" I asked rhetorically. "All people are the same in the end."</p><p>"Yeah," Naruto agreed. "I don't know what people were fighting over, back then, or why so many people died but… we're not enemies now. A person that gives his life defending others is someone that should be respected."</p><p>"Wisely spoken," the monk said, and bowed. "Welcome to the Saikon temple. This place was a bustling temple many years ago, but it was damaged in the fighting and is now kept as a memorial."</p><p>So 'derelict' wasn't too far off. I looked at the damage in a new light. Some of it was caused by time and nature, certainly, but… yes, I could see things that could have come from ninjutsu. There; charring. There; the ground split apart and cracked. There, in the wall…</p><p>"It almost looks like Rasengan," Naruto said, running his hand over the damage. The hole in the stone wall went all the way through, growing wider and wider, the edges of it carved like a drill. "Hey! There's like an earth wall outside!" He peered through the opening. "It goes on for <em> ages.</em> "</p><p>"It's impressive," I agreed. Naruto seemed more excited by the clear signs of battle here, but I found them almost eerie. A decade later, this was still here, even though there was no more fighting. Even though it was likely that all the people who had stood here, who had fought here, were already dead.</p><p>We wandered out of the temple to the field, and I couldn't help but run my hand over the wall. It was pock-marked with damage, and there were the handles of rusted knives sticking out of it. It might have been raised to block those, years and years ago. I could almost feel a ghost of chakra, trapped within the metal of one, as though it had been imbued with an attack that had never truly dissipated.</p><p>On a whim, I softened the rock, and pulled the handle free.</p><p>And blinked.</p><p><em> That's a Hiraishin kunai.</em></p><p>It was one thing, to suspect that he'd been here. Another to see proof that it couldn't have been anyone else. The kunai were distinctive, three bladed, and even now… the wrapping on the handle was aged and dirty, but the seal was still plain to see.</p><p>The Flying Thunder God Seal. What was it that Jiraiya had said? <em> He created his own branch of sealing to make it work.</em> This was… the utter pinnacle of sealing ability.</p><p>I swallowed, and looked around. Neither of the boys was nearby. I dropped the kunai into my leg pouch, feeling as though it were a hundred times heavier than a normal knife, as if I could feel the weight of its history and importance attached to the metal.</p><p><em> I didn't expect that.</em></p><p>Surely over the years, people would have come here, would have looked? But then, who cared for knives stuck in a wall of rock? Kunai weren't that expensive, and these were probably damaged beyond use anyway. Anyone who could easily remove them probably didn't care enough to try. If there had been loose Hiraishin kunai on the field, they'd probably been taken shortly after the battle – by either side.</p><p><em> Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous. What even is this? What are the chances that I would find that here?</em></p><p>"This is pretty cool, right?" Naruto said, beaming down at me from on top of the wall.</p><p>I swallowed. "Amazing," I agreed.</p><p>"What do you think, Sai?" Naruto called out, turning to look down the other side of the wall. With a shrug, I jumped up to stand beside him.</p><p>"There are a minimum of twelve different patterns of ninjutsu damage," Sai said. "That excludes those ninja who fought with genjutsu or taijutsu, or did not leave lasting damage to the environment as a result of their battle. More than one ninja may have used the same jutsu, and a single ninja may have used more than one type of jutsu. After so long, it is impossible to gain more accurate information regarding the battle here."</p><p>Naruto blinked. Then grinned "That's so cool, Sai! You can tell all that just by looking at this place?" He jumped down, landing lightly on the grass.</p><p>"If you would inform me of what you were looking for, I could be of more use," Sai said blandly, in a way that was completely unsubtle and yet flew miles over Naruto's head because he wasn't looking for anything at all.</p><p>"Fun," Naruto said. "We're looking for fun." He laughed.</p><p>I dropped to sit, legs dangling over the edge, and watched them with a smile.</p><p>Then, glad they were occupied, I pulled out my notebook and started to work. I had something to make, and not a lot of time to do it.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Hey, Sazanami!" Naruto shouted. "You're outside. Do you want your sword back?"</p><p>Sazanami took it back solemnly. "Thank you," he said. "For your help. All of it."</p><p>Naruto chuckled awkwardly and rubbed the back of his neck. "Well, it was our mission to catch that guy, and it was no problem to help you at the same time. Besides, you're a cool guy, and you helped us out first!"</p><p>"I don't think that really compares," Sazanami said, tipping his hat. "But I thank you kindly all the same."</p><p>"Are they really letting you go already?" I asked, mildly surprised. "That was quick."</p><p>"I'm on bail," he said. "Gatsu has agreed to ensure that I don't try and run." His lips quirked in a way that said he didn't intend to, but if he <em> had</em> , then that might not have been enough to stop him.</p><p>Gatsu crossed his arms. "Hmph. It's appalling to think that so much time and effort has been wasted on false accusations. These things should be properly investigated before a bounty is ever issued."</p><p>"I'm glad you feel that way, friend," Sazanami said. "It makes my life easier."</p><p>"Then we should return to Konoha," Sai said. "Our mission is complete, correct?"</p><p>"Yeah," I answered. "I have the information we needed. And the police know that Fire Country or Tea Country might want to extradite him, just in case." I shrugged. "There isn't much else we need to do."</p><p>Naruto nodded. "It was nice to meet you guys! I hope we'll see each other again sometime."</p><p>We turned to go, and I paused, as though I had just remembered something.</p><p>"Oh, Sazanami!" I scrambled in my pocket, withdrawing a small packet with a decorative coin and a slip of paper that was usually a fortune reading. "I brought you a good luck charm from the shrine. Stay out of trouble!"</p><p>The coin had been what sealed the idea, in the end. Once upon a time, I'd been a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. And when they had needed to communicate a location to each other in secret, they had used a set of charmed coins to transmit that information unnoticeably. The sort of item you could be expected to carry, and that no one would look too closely at.</p><p>This wasn't the first time I had tried to make that seal work. Linking two objects together wasn't so difficult in the end, but it was detectable, which was a problem for ninja. The burst of chakra that activating it made counteracted the benefits of having a secret transmission method in the first place. And the more information you tried to transmit, the more the connection degraded, the more chakra it took, and the more likely it would collapse and fail. Hence, having a letter that would instantly transcribe itself on a duplicate sheet of paper was impossible.</p><p>All this was currently completely irrelevant anyway, because Sazanami didn't use chakra. Having something that required him to activate with chakra just wouldn't have worked.</p><p>Instead, I'd made the connection 'open', and instructed him to inscribe the coordinates onto the side of the coin with blood, which would complete the seal and make it close. Hopefully. The open connection was more of a background hum than the spike of chakra that anyone would think to look for. Hopefully.</p><p>And if anyone with skill was paying him that much attention, he was probably in trouble anyway.</p><p>I liked to think it was a good solution to the 'how do I contact you' problem, even if it still had minor flaws. We didn't have to arrange a meeting time or location now, we could do it when he had some information.</p><p>"That was a good mission," Naruto said, tucking his hands behind his head. "But I can't wait to go home and visit Ichiraku."</p><p>I laughed. "Well, let's get moving then."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Are you the team from Konoha?" the woman behind the counter of the diner asked in relief. "Thank goodness you're here!"</p><p>Naruto and I traded looks. We'd stopped at the little crossroads inn for an early lunch before making our way through the Kubisaki pass, and hadn't expect that sort of greeting at all.</p><p>"Uhm," I said awkwardly. "We are <em> a</em> team from Konoha. But we weren't sent here. Did you hire a team?" Something was niggling at me. Something was … off.</p><p>"Yes," the woman replied. "Lady Kayo from the Land of Honey was supposed to be travelling through here with her retinue. But she never arrived, and we had no word that the trip had been cancelled. Something must have happened to her."</p><p>The woman in front of us was middle-aged, dressed appropriately for an owner of a small, family run alongside a pass that was infrequently used but not totally abandoned. It wasn't a major shipping route, but it <em> was</em> direct and not overtly difficult to cross. There was the chakra of a handful of civilians scattered upstairs – guests, presumably – and another two in the kitchen behind the counter.</p><p>No. One was a civilian. The other had ninja training.</p><p>"This is not our mission," Sai said to Naruto.</p><p>"That's awful," Naruto said, ignoring him completely. "And no one has come looking for her yet?"</p><p>"No," the woman said, a little fretfully. "We sent the message bird days ago. Someone should have been sent by now."</p><p>"You keep a message bird here?" I asked, curiously. That was actually starting to make more sense. The lady had recognised us as ninja, no question, which didn't seem strange until you contrasted it to the attitudes we had just had to deal with in Land of Stone. She'd known how to hire ninja right away.</p><p>"Oh yes," she said. "Well. Maybe you should talk to-" She turned to call out into the kitchen. "Ami, dear! The ninja are here!"</p><p>The chakra in the kitchen moved. The face that came out was familiar. It was surprising, yet not.</p><p>Ami. The girl who had clashed so frequently with Ino, Sakura and I at Konoha Academy. She had passed the graduation exam, but if only our three teams had made it into the General Forces… well. It had never occurred to me to wonder what she was doing now.</p><p>"Oh," she said, lukewarm. "Shikako. Naruto." Her eyes flickered over Naruto's Chunin vest.</p><p>"Ami," I said, politely. "So you're working here now?"</p><p>"Yes," she said, without elaboration. It was probably for the best – I could fill in myself why a Genin was posted somewhere like this with a message bird. Lost princesses notwithstanding. It probably wasn't a bad assignment for a first year Genin Corps, it did imply a certain degree of skill, trust and autonomy, even if it wasn't terribly exciting, but it likely didn't make her too happy to see us.</p><p>We left our orders for food, and Ami slipped out to sit at the table with us and fill us in on what had happened. Her report was pretty good, clear and concise, even if there weren't that many more details in general.</p><p>"The team is probably checking the route to see where she was last seen and following it from there," I said, studying the map. I could see a couple of hazards that could cause problems to a travelling group. "It makes more sense than coming out here and working backwards."</p><p>"There have been a couple of rumours about strange things happening at the old Kubisaki Castle," Ami confessed. "Nothing concrete. Just 'my brother had a friend who once saw' kind of stuff."</p><p>"What kind of things?" Naruto asked.</p><p>Ami shrugged. "Strange noises. Lights on inside the castle. People getting lost."</p><p>"People vanishing?" I asked, quirking an eyebrow.</p><p>"Nothing concrete," Ami repeated. "But a lot of people travel through without anyone knowing they're coming, so how can you tell if they never arrive?"</p><p>Naruto shivered. "Creepy. I hope it's not ghosts."</p><p>"Well," I said, meaningfully. "We're going that way anyway."</p><p>"We're going to help them, aren't we?" Sai said, sounding resigned.</p><p>He learnt so quickly.</p><p>Naruto nodded firmly. "Great idea, Sai. That's exactly what we're going to do."</p><p><hr /></p><p>AN: Parts of this chapter were super fun to write. Parts weren't and I'm not so happy with them. Also, so tempting to write The Adventures of Sazanami and Gatsu; Bounty Hunters. You know it would be great.</p><p>Oh, and, I don't usually like to confirm/deny plot things before they happen, but I can foresee this one filling up my inbox – no, Shikako is never going to learn the Hiraishin.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Haunted House Arc: Chapter 82</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Erimies has posted The Corona, featuring the DOS universe! So if 82 chapters plus change aren't enough for you… XD</p><p>Check out the 'dosbysilverqueen' tumblr page for audio posts and art, it's really kicking off now.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 82</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be. ~ Douglas Adams</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>We'd passed through Kubisaki pass on our way to the Land of Stone and it honestly hadn't struck me as anything very unusual.</p><p>This time, we were keeping our eyes open.</p><p>"It's creepy and I don't like it," Naruto determined as we circled the castle for the third time.</p><p>The castle was perched atop the cliff, watching over the pass like a guardian, but there was an easy path splitting off to the front gates. For being abandoned, it didn't look too shabby. It was a little battered maybe, but the walls and roof were still intact and it looked structurally sound and defensible.</p><p>And possibly a little creepy. I was <em> almost</em> certain I could see a light flickering in an upper window.</p><p>I made a noise of agreement. "I can't sense anyone inside," I said. "But-"</p><p>But it didn't feel normal, either. The castle was <em> Something.</em></p><p>What that something was, I didn't know and couldn't explain.</p><p>Naruto didn't look enthused. "I bet it's haunted."</p><p>"It's unnecessary for us to enter the castle," Sai offered. "It is not part of our mission and we are not required to undertake exploration."</p><p>"Yeah, but we promised we would," Naruto said. He squinted at the castle once more then squared his shoulders.</p><p>He stepped forward to knock-</p><p>- And the doors swung open.</p><p>He screamed and leapt back, landing in a crouch and drawing kunai in either hand. I fell into a fighting stance automatically at the sound, and Sai did the same.</p><p>After a second, I felt incredibly silly.</p><p>"It just surprised me, is all," Naruto muttered defensively.</p><p>"The only one who keeps insisting this place is haunted is you," I said, sighing, because we weren't going to get anywhere like this. There was 'careful' and then there was 'paranoid'. "I'm sure there's an explanation that <em> isn't</em> ghosts."</p><p>It wasn't exactly a glowing reassurance, but he did look a bit more confident.</p><p>"Right," Naruto agreed. "That would just be silly. Ghosts. Hah. Who believes in those?"</p><p>He crept forward gingerly though, cautiously edging into the entrance hall. Nothing happened.</p><p>Sai followed, on high alert. I gave once last look behind us and went in.</p><p>If the outside had been in good condition for an abandoned castle, then the inside was impossible. It was well lit, the furniture was as new, and there wasn't even any dust.</p><p>This place wasn't abandoned.</p><p>The doors creaked ominously, and slammed closed, shutting out the outside world.</p><p>Not just shutting out the sight of it.</p><p>They <em> shut it out</em> . I couldn't even sense it anymore. Like it wasn't there anymore.</p><p>I whirled around to try and yank them back open. The door handle turned to sticky slime under my fingers, melting away and <em> oozing</em> back into the wall.</p><p>I leapt backwards, tearing my hand away.</p><p>Not slime. Sticky, flesh like <em> something.</em> The wall pulsed, the wood-and-stone imagery giving way for a second to reveal something that was almost muscular.</p><p>"Naruto," I said urgently. "Can you summon a toad?"</p><p>Naruto blinked at me, but tried. His hand pressed flat against the floor, chakra heaving and falling. "No? Hey! Why not? Oi! Gamakichi!" He ran through the handseals again.</p><p>I backed away from the walls, stepping carefully, even though they were once more disguised. "I think the castle is a summons. We're inside it now. Once the doors shut, it trapped us."</p><p>"Like the Pervy Sage's Toad Stomach technique," Naruto said, thankfully catching on. I forgot he'd probably seen it in action against Itachi.</p><p>"What does that mean?" Sai asked. He'd backed up too, turning and standing shoulder to shoulder with me. If Naruto joined in, we'd be in a perfect defensive Manji formation. There was something reassuring about it, knowing that he'd responded like that, instinctively defensive, even though he had protested this exploration all along. "Can we create an escape route?"</p><p>I shifted uneasily. The floor beneath my feet still felt like wood. But I wouldn't bet on it. I doubted anything around us was part of the <em> original</em> castle.</p><p>"Summoning jutsu like this make a self-contained chakra-space…" I said. "It's not something you can just <em> cross.</em> You have to break the technique." Like when Ibiki had tried to capture the Sound Four; like when Kajika's group had trapped sensei in a seal. "We might be able to damage it enough that we can cancel it, or we might have to disrupt it some other way."</p><p>And I wasn't sure what that would mean for us trapped inside. I really didn't want to dispel a summons only to find that it took us back to its homeland with it.</p><p>Still, that was probably the best option. If we attacked this outer wall… maybe a Rasengan, or if I used explosives…</p><p>"Hey," Naruto asked sounding troubled. He'd moved deeper into the castle, apparently unafraid now that it definitely wasn't ghosts. "Are these…"</p><p>A little reluctantly, I turned to see what he was looking at. Set against the back wall of the entrance hall were three packs. Almost identical to the ones we were carrying.</p><p>I crouched next to them, and carefully flipped the top open. It didn't take more than a quick look to pick out signs that these belonged to ninja. Actually…</p><p>"I'm pretty sure this is Ino's," I said. It was a surprise – even if there was a Konoha team running around, that didn't mean it had to be one we knew. Let alone one we knew well.</p><p>But it also made me uneasy. If she had been here, had taken her pack off, had been trapped like we were trapped…</p><p>Where was she now?</p><p>"Let's go find them," Naruto said.</p><p>I didn't voice the possibility that we wouldn't. I didn't even want to think it.</p><p>"I can't sense them," I said softly. It could have just been that the castle-summons was blocking my ability. We were, after all, inside it. The walls, the floor, the air, they were all saturated with its chakra. Maybe I just couldn't pick anything out, through all that noise.</p><p>I sealed the packs away into one of my storage scrolls. Who knew if we could come back this way, again. Maybe there was an exit somewhere else and the team had just decided to leave them behind.</p><p>I pressed my hands to the floor, letting ink spill out into an explosive seal. A last resort. If we couldn't find Ino… if they weren't in here… I could set it off and make the summons dispel. I hoped.</p><p>The next room was a dining room, with a long table set with seven plates. They were still warm, like the occupants had just got up and stepped out for a moment.</p><p>It was more than a little creepy.</p><p>We skirted around it, peering cautiously into the hallway. It was long and narrow, with many varied doors scattered along it. I would have called it a perfect ambush spot, except that we were <em> already in the trap.</em> There were several armour forms – statues? Displays? – along the length, that reminded me of nothing more than golems. Not that they had their own chakra reserves, but I wouldn't count them out.</p><p>"That picture is the same as the one in the entrance hall," Sai said, abruptly. "It is identical."</p><p>"Repeating design elements?" I suggested. "We know the whole thing is a fake." Or it could have been purposeful. For some reason. The man in the picture looked important, dressed like a lord, and people generally didn't display huge portraits everywhere for no reason.</p><p>"Man, I don't know where to start looking," Naruto complained. "I'll send out clones and then we can just follow them."</p><p>I nodded in acceptance. Naruto's Shadow Clones were useful for searching large areas in short amounts of time. I didn't know how much time we'd have to search.</p><p>Except the second he clapped his hands together in the seal was the second things started to go wrong.</p><p><em> It knows it's an attack!</em></p><p>The illusion of the building cut out, leaving pulsing walls of muscle, heaving and contorting. The floor was no longer stone, and pulsed under foot, rising and twisting like a wave. It bubbled up around my ankles and I leapt up, looking frantically for somewhere to land that <em> wasn't</em> dangerous.</p><p>I felt the catch and release of a replacement jutsu, one of Naruto's clones trying to pull me out, but <em> there was nowhere to go.</em> My new location was no better than the last, even as I tried to retreat for where the doors had been.</p><p>I pressed chakra to my feet, trying to skate on top of the summons and not let it catch and drag me down. Naruto's chakra was whirling as he formed a Rasengan to fight it off, and Sai was floating on the back of an ink bird, desperately twisting and turning into the air to avoid what looked like a lashing tongue.</p><p>"Split up!" Naruto shouted. "We still have to find them!" Some of his clones darted off, Sai flew higher both in an attempt to dodge and follow that order. I went backwards, putting distance between us, aiming for the entrance.</p><p>"… devour…" the walls hissed. "All who enter will be devoured…"</p><p>That was just. Lovely.</p><p>I stamped down, pressing a Touch Blast into the floor with my foot, and leapt away even as it surged up and dragged at my ankles. I wouldn't be able to keep this up. Already my legs were starting to burn with the effort, and if I didn't find somewhere safe to land…</p><p>The explosion was satisfying. The way the entire floor then retracted and I <em> fell</em> was less so.</p><p>I twisted in the air like a cat and prepared myself for what was below me. To my surprise, it was hard stone. I landed in a crouch, absorbing the fall with my knees, poised to jump away again if the ground turned out to be a trap. But it appeared as though it were actual stone, not genjutsu or transformation jutsu. There was no chakra running through it. Maybe this had been part of the original castle and I had been disgorged out of it… or maybe it had also been swallowed and simply remained intact inside the stomach…</p><p>I looked up, but the ceiling had surged together again, closing over and blocking any glimpse of my teammates. That wasn't good. We were separated now. And I'd seen enough horror movies to know that that wasn't a good plan.</p><p><em> It's a summon. Not a haunted castle. Naruto really got to you with that.</em></p><p>But I could sense something interesting.</p><p>Something that made being separated worthwhile.</p><p>Without the chakra of the summons interfering and blocking me… I could sense people.</p><p>I raced down the corridor, taking turns at speed and hurdling over piles and rubble. There were bodies littering the way, but they were old ones. Almost skeletons. Wearing armour. Not important.</p><p>I rounded the last bend and ducked. A kunai flew perilously close to my head and ruffled my hair.</p><p><em> Maybe shouldn't have surprised them</em> ,I thought a tad sheepishly.</p><p>"Shikako?" Ino said, looking absolutely flabbergasted. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>I was so glad to see her. And Shino and Hinata. The three of them were tending to a set of civilians, probably the missing lady and her party. They all looked uninjured, if a bit scuffed and upset.</p><p>I guessed I was the last person she expected to see. "Oh, you know," I said. "We were in the neighbourhood. Need a hand?"</p><p>"Like getting yourself stuck in here as well is so helpful," she retorted after a seconds pause. "Do you even know what's going on? How'd you get here so fast?"</p><p>"Yes," Shino agreed. "I would also like the answers to those questions. Why? Because we did not send any request for backup."</p><p>"My team was in the Land of Stone," I explained. "We were heading towards Kubisaki Pass when your contact told us that you hadn't arrived. So we diverted here to see if you needed help."</p><p>"Right," Ino said, not sounding very impressed. "But do you know what's going on?"</p><p>"It's a summons," I said. "Disguised to take the form of the castle and deal with intruders."</p><p>"Yes," Hinata agreed softly. "It was summoned by Gosa Kubisaki fifty years ago at the conclusion of a battle when his forces were overrun. They retreated here, but the enemy followed them. So he used the castle as a trap to get rid of them, and it's been here ever since." She was holding onto some old, yellowed scroll, so presumably there had been a written record of it somewhere in here. "Once they were inside they couldn't leave… and they either killed each other or starved to death." She gestured at the bodies.</p><p>"A summons staying around for that long… after the summoner is dead even…" I mused. "There's got to be an anchoring seal somewhere. No way there isn't." It was kind of impressive. In a horrible sort of way.</p><p>Did it even count as a pyrrhic victory? It wasn't so much a victory as posthumous revenge.</p><p>"Yes, we assumed as much, and attempted to discover and destroy them," Shino said. He adjusted his glasses. "However, we have been unable to leave this section of the castle, once we were taken here."</p><p>"Are there traps?" I asked. I hadn't seen anything on my way – hadn't even occurred to me. I should have been more careful.</p><p>Shino shook his head. "No more than it used against us before. It is simply that Hinata is the only one of us who has successfully managed to damage the castle. My Kikaichu are at a supreme disadvantage against this summon. Why? Because it appears to be insectivorous."</p><p>"And I don't really want to try and see if my jutsu works on it," Ino admitted, hands curling into fists.</p><p>"Yeah, no," I agreed. After what had happened <em> last time</em> , I didn't want her to try and see either. "We're not trying that."</p><p>I took a second to consider the situation. It wasn't <em> dire</em> , exactly, but it was serious. In this section of basement, we at least weren't at risk of being 'devoured'. But it didn't bode well for our long term prospects, either, given the bodies around us.</p><p>"Hinata," I asked. "Can you see any seals? Or scrolls? It would probably have to be in a section of the castle like this, or in a … separate chakra space." I wasn't exactly sure that you would be able to write a seal to summon something on the summons itself. That was a bit… circular. Wasn't it?</p><p>It was probably separate.</p><p><em> Crap. What if it's outside?</em> No. If Kubisaki had retreated to the castle, that meant he'd summoned it from inside the castle. Therefore, the seal should also be inside the castle.</p><p>If it wasn't…</p><p>We'd try something else.</p><p>My planning was cut off by a deep rumbling, and the ground we were on shook, as though the whole section had been dislodged and was moving. Lady Kayo gave a short scream, and Ino reached out reassuringly to steady her.</p><p><em> Should probably hurry up,</em> I thought grimly. Just because the danger wasn't immediate, didn't mean it wasn't there.</p><p>"Shino… what were your plans?" I asked. It might have been a bit belated, given the way I had just charged in and started asking questions… but he was the Chunin in charge.</p><p>But Shino looked at me seriously. It was hard to tell with his dark glasses, but his gaze seemed assessing. "Do you have suggestions?" he asked.</p><p>"The hardest part is going to be keeping them safe," I admitted, gesturing at the civilians. I kept my voice quiet, so they wouldn't overhear. "They can't travel out of this section, and four of us can hardly carry seven of them…" Maybe if Naruto were down here with his shadow clones; that could easily provide enough spare bodies…</p><p>Thoughts turned over in my head. "If Hinata can find Naruto and bring him back," I said slowly, a plan coming together. Hinata could break through the walls, but the others would probably be better off staying and protecting the civilians. "Then that shouldn't be a problem… I could go and find the seal…"</p><p>"By yourself?" Ino interjected as she came closer, voice a little doubtful. "It'll probably have defences if it's so important."</p><p>I shrugged. "Then that'll give you more time to get ready. I think we'll need pretty good timing if we want to escape safely." I was being purposefully vague on the details of the plan here, because I didn't really have details of the plan. It was basically the same plan we'd had before, only with more people involved.</p><p>"That's not even related to <em> the</em> <em> point,</em> " Ino said. "I'm coming with you."</p><p>I thought about all the things I could say to stop her. And some of them? Some of them were cruel. '<em> You'll only be dead weight'.</em></p><p>I shrugged again. "Okay." That would leave Shino alone down here… but he nodded, so apparently he agreed with Ino.</p><p>Okay, then.</p><p>We re-grouped and explained the plan to Hinata, who was a pretty crucial part. With her Byakugan, she'd be able to keep an eye on everyone's progress, and thus make sure we were all operating in sync. Without communicators, it was about the best we could do.</p><p>The ground shook again.</p><p>We exchanged grim looks.</p><p>"Okay," I said. "Now." I drew the Sword of the Thunder God, flicked it on with a thrum of chakra, and focused. I slashed it through the air, patterning my chakra so that the blade extended like a wave or a whip, lightning lashing up into the ceiling. It carved through, leaving only the smell of burning flesh behind.</p><p>We leapt up, Ino and I splitting one way, Hinata going the other.</p><p>I bounced off a wall, foot planted on the head of an armoured form that was slowly moving, and slashed at the ceiling again.</p><p>There was a hissing, gurgling sound, and fluid started to gush from the walls, dripping down around us. I hissed as some of it splashed on exposed skin.</p><p>"Stomach acid," Ino said, wincing, either from disgust or pain. She had more exposed skin than I did.</p><p>"It really doesn't want us going this way," I confirmed. Which had to mean we were going in the right direction. Given that we only had a vague idea of where we were going, and that our surroundings could change at any given moment, that was actually a good sign. Well. 'Good'.</p><p>We went up another level and a tapestry turned into an extending, lashing tongue. I wheeled backwards, conscious of the fact that we couldn't stop moving or risk being sucked into the floor.</p><p>Ino looped ninja wire around her fingers and caught it in a twisted ring of wire, catching the ends in a kunai hoop and pinning it to the floor, effectively immobilising it.</p><p>"Thanks," I acknowledged.</p><p>She nodded, a quick distracted thing, as we kept racing on, leaping over grasping appendages and sliding through gaps where the walls closed together to catch us. I wielded the sword with brutal efficiency and carved us a path where we wanted to go.</p><p>We hit what would have been the upper landing, prepared for a final launch to the towers and…</p><p>Everything stopped.</p><p>The walls and floor reverted to the illusion. The acid vanished. The armour statues returned to places by the wall.</p><p>And a ghost walked out of the door.</p><p>"It did this before. The phantom," Ino said. "He's just another one of its tricks."</p><p>"Uhm, no," I said, staring at him. "I think he's really a ghost."</p><p>A ghost. A <em> ghost</em> . It crossed in front of us, didn't look at us, didn't react, and started up the stairs.</p><p>I hesitated a second, then followed.</p><p>If you'd asked me why I was so sure it wasn't a trap, I would have fumbled with an answer. The truth was, I could sense it, but hazily, as though it were smoke in the breeze. Not <em> quite</em> chakra, but maybe spiritual energy. There was clearly nothing physical to it.</p><p>It was an imprint. Something left behind after the death of the physical.</p><p>Maybe some actions, some journeys, were repeated enough that they were engrained in the fabric of the world, that even when they were no longer undertaken, they could still be seen? How many times had he walked this path, if it lingered after his death?</p><p>Or…</p><p>I'd never argued that souls could exist. Not now. How could I? How else could I be here? And you could quantify them and bind them with jutsu – that was the premise of Edo Tensei, however awful it was.</p><p>So, after that, was it such a stretch to believe that ghosts could exist too? That after the body died, the soul could linger, could still have the determination and will to influence things? Especially if there was something to anchor it to, a summons… or a seal?</p><p>We followed Kubisaki, and who else could he be but the lord who had summoned this castle to deal with his enemies, to the top of the stairs, and along to a room that held a dais on which rested a scroll.</p><p>He stopped then.</p><p>"He… brought us to the seal?" Ino asked, behind me. "Why?"</p><p>And the ghost bowed his head. "It has been…" he said, as though it took so, so much effort. "so long…"</p><p>He was talking to us. Had heard, and could answer. This wasn't just an imprint, repeating actions mindlessly them. He was aware. Alive, without being alive.</p><p>If you could be alive after death, then what was death, really? Were all those people that sought immortality really so crazy as they seemed? The boundaries of life and death were really rather more… flexible than they should have been.</p><p>I swallowed. <em> Naruto is right. Ghosts are terrifying.</em></p><p>I pushed the considerations of the afterlife and all its related implications aside. It was too big to deal with now. Maybe too big to ever deal with.</p><p>"The seal," I said, instead, and stepped around the ghost to look at it. No way was I touching him.</p><p>The black ink on the table was basic, and at its most simple was merely a chakra funnel, gathering natural energy and providing it to the scroll in the middle. That was what anchored it, providing it the energy to stay.</p><p>"He is loyal," the ghost said. "I asked him to stay… to devour my enemies, and he did so. But it has been so long."</p><p>"And now he won't leave," I finished, only flicking a glimpse at him through my bangs. Gingerly, I unrolled the edge of the scroll, to see what it was.</p><p>Then I sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>"This is the contract!"</p><p>Not just a summoning seal. But the actual contract as signed by every summoner. The edges of it were inked with designs of animals… chameleon. I guessed that made sense. Insectivorous, illusion users. Kubisaki's name was there, the very last on the list.</p><p>"What's that mean?" Ino asked. "In terms of us getting out of here."</p><p>"Return him home," the ghost breathed and started to fade away. "It is over…"</p><p>I cleared my throat. "I could disrupt the seal. Or destroy the scroll. I'm pretty sure that either of those things would disrupt the summon. But I'm not sure what would happen to everyone that was inside it. But we have another option…"</p><p>Ino seemed to click instantly. "Sign the scroll."</p><p>"It's not a perfect solution. Summons don't <em> have</em> to listen and obey… they've still got free will." Given the way that Gamabunta or Manda behaved, obedience was not guaranteed in the slightest.</p><p>"But we'd be able to dismiss it, at the least," Ino said. "Okay. I'll sign it."</p><p>I paused. "Are you sure?" Because she'd decided so <em> fast.</em> It seemed almost rash.</p><p>"Yeah." She nodded quickly. "It fits me more than it fits you. Aren't you glad I decided to come with you?"</p><p>"Always," I said. "Alright, sign quickly. I don't know what the ghost did to make it calm down, but it probably won't last."</p><p>She cut her fingertip on the point of a kunai and wrote her name in blood on the scroll, pressing a palm print to the bottom of it. The scroll seemed to shiver, the ink blurring and reforming.</p><p>It was accepted, then.</p><p>She cleared her throat. "Hello. This is Ino Yamanaka. I just signed your summoning scroll. Please return all the people you have swallowed to the outside world. Then … you can dismiss yourself and return to the summon realm."</p><p>We waited with baited breath.</p><p>"Your words have been heard," the castle sighed.</p><p>And then everything shivered. My feet were swept out from underneath me and the two of us tumbled together. I reacted like it was an attack, rolling Ino beneath me so I could stand, hands flying to my kunai-</p><p>- And we tumbled onto the grass. There was a tangle of limbs as approximately thirteen people, give or take a few clones, landed in the same spot.</p><p>Ino 'oofed', air wheezing out of her lungs. "Couldn't have said 'gently return', couldn't I?" she muttered.</p><p>I made a grunting sound, because someone's knee was making acquaintance with my kidneys.</p><p>"Hey!" Naruto shouted. "What's the big idea?!" He leapt to his feet, looking like he wanted to charge back at the castle.</p><p>But the castle was no longer there.</p><p>It was dark outside, late at night, but it was still clear to see that there was nothing but rubble remaining of the Kubisaki castle.</p><p>"But where did it go?" Naruto asked, baffled, and looked around as though it could be hiding.</p><p>Shino managed to extract himself from the pile, and adjusted his sunglasses. "Obviously the plan to disrupt the seal and dismiss the summons was a success. We simply were not required to create an escape route after all."</p><p>"Yep," I said, getting to my feet, and starting to help the others up. I took a quick headcount to make sure we were all there. Sai – the lucky one – had managed to avoid getting dogpiled entirely and was hanging at the edge of the group with an expression that almost counted as a frown. "You can thank Ino."</p><p>Naruto scratched the back of his head and then shrugged. "Okay. Thanks Ino! So… that's the mission complete, right?"</p><p>"Not entirely," Shino corrected. "Why? Because we should escort Lady Kayo to a safe destination. However, it is too late for travel over the mountain path, so we should establish a camp here."</p><p>"That's going to be fun," Ino muttered. "We don't have any gear."</p><p>"Oh, right," I said. "I picked that up for you." I unsealed their packs from my storage scroll. "And we have a tent and stuff. It's too late for us to go on, too, so we might as well camp out with you."</p><p>"Yeah!" Naruto agreed. "That sounds super fun, right Sai?"</p><p>"We shouldn't delay our return to Konoha," Sai said, which was a weak protest, since we'd actually wrapped up our own mission well under time frame. Tsunade wouldn't even be expecting us back yet.</p><p>"We're totally not," Naruto said, fairly. "We have to camp somewhere. So it might as well be here."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"So who's tall, dark and pale?" Ino asked, dropping to sit on the log beside me. She'd been busy helping all the civilians settle in while we'd made camp. I'd offered to help, but frankly I'd been glad to be turned down.</p><p>I stopped scribbling in my notebook and tucked it away.</p><p>"Sai?" I asked, tilting my head. "He's a Chunin who was assigned to us for our mission."</p><p>She stretched out, wincing as her shoulders cracked. "We were both sent on the wrong mission," she said.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, not quite sure what she meant.</p><p>"Creepy haunted castle? That has you all over it. I should have got the cute new guy." She eyed Sai where he was sitting quietly, drawing. He'd been even more reserved tonight than he had been on our mission, and that was saying something.</p><p>I huffed a laugh, almost startled. "We could have used you for the interrogation," I admitted. "So yeah, you're probably right. We would have been perfect in opposite places."</p><p>Our shoulders bumped. "Well," she said, sounding more subdued. "What can you do? Have to cope with what you've got."</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed. "So. New summons, huh? How's that feel?"</p><p>"I'm not sure," Ino admitted. "I mean, it's totally unexpected. But I think I'll wait till I'm back in Konoha before I try summoning any of them. After that, it could go either way. But… if it works out, they could be really useful."</p><p>"Oh, yeah. Well, as long as you're into people-eating-castles," I teased. "Those are super useful."</p><p>In the morning, we split ways. I gave Ino a teasing warning to not be surprised by who their contact was – which only really ensured she was super curious about it the whole way there – and headed back to Konoha.</p><p><hr /></p><p>And, since I probably won't have a new chapter before then – Merry Christmas all!</p><p>(Or Happy Holiday of your choosing.)</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

"Papers?"</p><p>"Geeze, Sasuke," Naruto complained. "It's like you don't know us or anything."</p><p>Sasuke looked dully bored and this was clearly not the first hour of his shift on the front gates of Konoha. I didn't really envy him the duty. Sure, it was necessary. And sure, if it failed, things would get <em> bad</em> , but that didn't actually mean it was fun to do.</p><p>"No exceptions, idiot," Sasuke scoffed. He held out his hand and wiggled his fingers impatiently.</p><p>Naruto grumbled as he passed his ID card and the mission scroll over.</p><p>Teasingly, Sasuke flicked his Sharingan on and inspected it seriously, turning it over like he expected there to be something wrong with it.</p><p>I snickered and dropped mine on the table, beside Sai's. "I feel safer knowing Sasuke is prepared for all the imposters trying to sneak into the village <em> right now.</em> "</p><p>There was silence. Not just 'silence' but <em> silence.</em> Meaningful, as conversations cut out behind me, as nervous tension jumped in the air.</p><p>I had just enough time to meet Sasuke's eyes in surprise, watched them widen in warning, before I dropped, rolling sideways away from the knife that swiped through the air where my head had been. I came up on one knee, shadow coiling like a spring and lashing out.</p><p>In the second I had been down, Sasuke leapt across the table and had one man pinned face down in the dirt, arms twisted up his back. The second had been backed against the wall with Sai's tanto pressed snugly against his throat.</p><p>The crowd startled, a few sudden screams springing up. Ninja materialised out of the gates, to herd them back and to remove the prisoners we had acquired. The Special Jounin – Hayate, I thought, the proctor from the exams – who had been manning the opposite desk, stood and quickly took charge of the situation, efficiently directing people until it was as if nothing had ever happened.</p><p>The fight had taken a second, maybe less. The clean up might have taken a minute. In less time than it took for someone to have a smoke break, the line was moving again.</p><p>No one could say ninja weren't efficient.</p><p>"That was dumb," I said, "launching an attack right at the gates. What did they think would happen?"</p><p>Sasuke rolled his eyes. "Probably because you just <em> blew their cover.</em> Why do you have to make my job difficult?"</p><p>"I was just making a joke," I muttered. Because dammit, I hadn't known they were infiltrators. How the hell would I have known that? If they'd kept their cool and <em> not attacked me</em> I would never have known anything. They'd have had much better luck if they'd just kept bluffing. Didn't they teach you that before they sent you off from infiltrator school?</p><p><em> Deny, deny, deny.</em></p><p>Sasuke swept our ninja ID's up, and handed them back to us. "Get lost," he ordered. But he smirked, so I was pretty sure the brief fight had been the highlight of his day.</p><p>I stepped past, then had an idea. I smacked him on the shoulder. "Dinner. Ichiraku."</p><p>Sasuke shrugged. I took that as acceptance.</p><p>"Dinner after missions is a Team Seven tradition," I explained to Sai, as we continued on. "And Ichiraku is Naruto's favourite."</p><p>Those two sentences were both true. They just weren't related at all. But I didn't… I really didn't want to take Sai to my home. He hadn't <em> done</em> anything on this mission, and that wasn't as reassuring as it should have been. Because if he hadn't done anything, then why was he here? Why now, why with us, what was he after. What had he accomplished that I <em> hadn't seen? </em></p><p>And until I had answers to those questions, then I didn't want him in my home.</p><p>But I didn't want to totally exclude him either. One, I wanted to keep an eye on Sai, not just now but in the long term. Two… socialising would be good for him.</p><p>"Ichiraku is the best!" Naruto said without pause. I was glad he hadn't questioned the change in routine, which was partially the reason I'd chosen Ichiraku. Naruto was hardly going to turn down an excuse to visit his favourite place. "You've gotta come. The tofu ramen is really good!"</p><p>Sai didn't really say 'yes' but he didn't say 'no' either, and I was hoping that his general propensity to follow orders would come through for us here.</p><p>"If you don't like Ichiraku," I offered. "You can pick the restaurant next time." Implicit that there would be a next time, that we would have another mission together. But Naruto had taken to Sai, so I was pretty sure that he was going to request it.</p><p>It wouldn't be so bad, as long as I could keep an eye on him. And work out what he was up to.</p><p>Being able to keep Sai would be handy, in the long run. It gave us a line back to Danzo, who had already shown he could keep tabs on us. We were playing at a disadvantage, here.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Sai! You made it!" Naruto waved vigorously and nearly fell off his stool. Sasuke's reflexive grab was the only thing that stopped him.</p><p>Sasuke looked like he regretted the impulse. "Idiot, sit down," he said. "You're making a spectacle of yourself."</p><p>"Taicho," Sai greeted, barely refraining from standing at attention. "I am present, as requested."</p><p>Naruto practically beamed at the title. Sasuke looked at me and raised an eyebrow. I shrugged.</p><p>"This is Sai," Naruto said to Sasuke. "He was on our last mission with us. He's a pretty cool guy – he does this awesome ink drawing stuff. And this is Sasuke, our other team mate."</p><p>"Thanks for watching their backs," Sasuke said, and though he sounded disinterested there was something sharp and wary about his eyes. "And for this morning. You've got good reactions."</p><p>Sai simply nodded and slid into the open seat beside Naruto. Ichiraku was pretty busy at the moment, so we were crammed together down one half of the counter. But the food still arrived pretty sharply after we gave our orders.</p><p>Naruto filled the air with chatter, about our mission, pestering Sasuke about what he'd been doing, dragging Sai into the conversation – he was actually getting pretty good at wrangling people into talking with him and not just talking <em> at</em> them.</p><p>We didn't end up staying that long. Sai slunk off shortly after the 'goal' of consuming food was completed. I couldn't say I was exactly sorry to see him go, but Sai was a problem that I would rather have close at hand, rather than operating where I couldn't see what he was up to.</p><p>We went to the training grounds. It was starting to get too late to really be training now, but we were beginning to get used to taking our time together where we could get it and it wasn't like you could pick your conditions in the field. We'd worked that out.</p><p>"Spar?" Naruto suggested brightly.</p><p>I smiled. "I have a few new seals I want to test out in controlled conditions." Not that sparring was really 'controlled' per se. But it was better than trying to test them in actual combat for the first time. That was reserved for if we were in really deep trouble.</p><p>Sasuke eyed me warily. "I don't like the sound of that."</p><p>"They're harmless," I assured him. "Really. They shouldn't even explode."</p><p>I wasn't even lying, so the fact that that only made them warier was <em> fantastic</em> .</p><p>The seal I was talking about was basically a magnet. Magnetism as a jutsu was pretty damn rare, but I couldn't see a reason why. Magnetic fields were easy. Wrap a coil of wire around a hunk of metal, and bam, electromagnet. High school physics level. If you could do it like that, then you could probably do it with chakra. I <em> knew</em> you could do it with seals.</p><p>It was just that magnetic fields were one of those huge, fundamental forces. They were a little intimidating.</p><p>I wasn't even all that interested in the magnets themselves – this was just my trial run for the one I really was interested in; Gravity.</p><p>That was going to be more difficult.</p><p>"Ready?" I asked, teasingly.</p><p>The boys looked at each other, then leapt backwards up into the trees.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"So?" Sasuke prompted, turning to me, once we had finished sparring.</p><p>"So what?" I returned, genuinely perplexed. He'd have to give me a little bit more to go on than that.</p><p>"How come you don't like Sai?" Naruto continued. He frowned. "I thought you didn't, but then you were all nice to him so I thought maybe you did, but then…"</p><p>Huh. Naruto was always perceptive when you didn't really want him to be. "I like him just fine," I said. That was true, wasn't it? "It's just different working with someone new."</p><p>"Right," Naruto said doubtfully. "Because even if he's a little weird, I think he's really lonely. He needs a friend."</p><p>"I know," I said gently. Sometimes, I was in danger of forgetting that Naruto didn't win people over because he was a great fighter, or anything like that. It was because he empathised. He'd seen himself in Gaara and Haku and Sasuke. And now in Sai. And he'd wanted to help them. "I think so too."</p><p>Sasuke shrugged. Whether people <em> liked</em> each other had never been a high priority to him. But he probably spotted the inconsistency of not having team dinner at my house, amongst</p><p>other things. He was undoubtedly curious.</p><p>"Baa-chan agreed he could come with us on our next mission," Naruto said, like I hadn't been there for that conversation. "That's okay, right?"</p><p>I smiled reassuringly. "That's very okay."</p><p>Risky maybe, but okay.</p><p>"It's … interesting," Sasuke said, slowly. He crossed his arms, and leant against the wooden training post. "This morning at the gates…"</p><p>"He was pretty cool, right?" Naruto said. "Like, Shikako moved and then you moved, and then Sai had the other guy caught before I could even do anything." He looked a little sheepish.</p><p>It wasn't that Naruto didn't have good reflexes. He did. Once he knew that he was in a fight. Something like this morning, where the fight was unexpected and unprovoked could still take him by surprise. That was just something that experience would teach.</p><p><em> I'd</em> been taken by surprise.</p><p>"That too," Sasuke said. "But his ninja ID…"</p><p>I sharpened. "Yeah?"</p><p>He looked at me, steadily. "It was new. Newer than ours. It wasn't worn. Didn't even have any fingerprints on it." Ours were new, seven months old, and it wasn't like we subjected them to terrible conditions. But they still got handled, pulled in and out of pockets, got bent and scratched. The edges wore away. They got faded and frayed.</p><p>"You could see that?" Naruto asked, confused.</p><p>Sasuke shrugged. "I had my Sharingan on, remember?"</p><p>I sat back. Not surprising, if 'Sai' was an identity created for this mission. Sasuke hadn't said there was anything <em> wrong</em> with the ID, which probably meant it was either a perfect forgery or created by the Konoha Administration. It wasn't hard to imagine that Danzo could get things fabricated. ROOT had to be interwoven with the village in order to function.</p><p>"People get replacement cards," I said cautiously. It was true.</p><p>"Yeah," Naruto said. "Maybe it got damaged on a mission. We could have asked him."</p><p>I… didn't really want that to happen. It was better for us, if Sai didn't know we knew. Once he realised we were onto him, it was going to be so much harder to keep an eye on him, than if he thought we were just unaware.</p><p>"It's not really a big deal," I said. "I mean, it's just a card."</p><p>Sasuke stiffened. Sharpened. "Do you know something, Shikako?" he asked.</p><p><em> Aww, dammit.</em></p><p>I blinked, trying to look surprised. Also innocent. "No?"</p><p>Unfortunately, Sasuke didn't look deterred. "We all know something is up," he said. "You might as well spill."</p><p>I did groan, that time. "Sasuke."</p><p>"Look," he said. "You did this before. With Yakumo. And you said you'd tell me next time."</p><p>I wasn't sure I <em> had</em> said that, actually.</p><p>"I don't know what it is," I tried.</p><p>Sasuke continued to look unimpressed. He folded his arms.</p><p>"I don't know <em> exactly</em> what's wrong," I amended. "And you're just going to think I'm paranoid." I chanced a glance at Naruto. He looked pretty nonplussed, looking between me and Sasuke like there was a tennis match in progress.</p><p>"I'm starting to feel pretty paranoid myself," Sasuke grumbled. His eyes were searching mine. "But even if it's nothing, we can look into it together. You don't have to do it alone."</p><p>"You're a better friend than I deserve," I said, sighing. I dropped my eyes to stare at the ground. The guilt was biting, a niggling feeling of shame twisting in my gut.</p><p>I was perfectly aware I was going to keep lying to him. There were a lot of things I was lying to Sasuke about, even if only by admission. He was better than I deserved.</p><p>"Shikako?" Naruto cut in. He sounded worried, and earnest. His face was creased and lined. "Is something wrong?"</p><p>I crumbled.</p><p>"Sai," I said. "Don't you think he's a bit… strange?"</p><p>"The ID," Sasuke said. "That's important, right?"</p><p>I nodded. "I think so. And just how he acts and stuff. Some of the questions he asked. Nothing big. Nothing that <em> proves</em> anything." I was trying to downplay it, now. Because I couldn't <em> really</em> point a finger to any one thing that screamed suspicious.</p><p>Sasuke hesitated, as though he were putting things together. "You think he's…" his voice dropped, secretive, even though we were here alone. His hands twitched into the sign for 'Anbu'. "There to watch out for you and Naruto? It's probably not the worst idea."</p><p>It was actually a little impressive that Sasuke had managed to come to a nearly correct conclusion from only two meetings. From barely any information at all.</p><p>"Or to watch <em> us,</em> " I said. No, Tsunade assigning an Anbu to watch out for Naruto wouldn't have been the worst of ideas, when Kakashi-sensei was away and we were down a team member. But.</p><p>"That's the bit where you start to sound paranoid," Sasuke said cautiously.</p><p>"Wait." Naruto's voice rose several decibels. "Sai is-!"</p><p>I cut him off with a furious wave. "Don't say it! You aren't supposed to talk about it," I said. You weren't actually supposed to <em> know</em> about Anbu, even when it was something that 'everyone knew', like Kakashi-sensei. It was a bit of polite fiction. "And… Maybe. We don't know."</p><p>Naruto cupped his hand in his chin. "That's pretty cool. I believe it."</p><p>I shared a look with Sasuke.</p><p>"You can't believe it if we don't have evidence," Sasuke scolded, exasperated.</p><p>"We could ask," Naruto protested.</p><p>"We can't ask," I said, firmly. "It's a secret, remember?"</p><p>Damn, but I felt like a juggler, trying to keep a hundred balls in the air. I couldn't tell if this whole conversation had been a good thing or a bad thing. Maybe both.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Nara R&amp;D stole me away for the next few days, for the introductory course / internship thing that I probably should have gone through before I'd been thrown in the deep end. It might not have totally prevented that giant muck up, but it probably would have gone a long way. And now I would absolutely classify all my seals as 'personal' rather than 'experimental' and would attach them only very grudgingly to my research project.</p><p>It wasn't all bad, and I could see the point of it, but it did seem too-little-too-late.</p><p>"Are you certain you don't want to transfer here full time?" Kofuku-oba asked.</p><p>"Absolutely certain," I said, flatly. "I like field work."</p><p>I hadn't wanted full time before, I certainly didn't want it now. This wasn't even part time. It was extracurricular. It was 'when I have time' work.</p><p>Except, there were a couple of things I really would have liked access to <em> right now</em> , that were unfortunately out of my reach.</p><p>I had a Hiraishin kunai burning a hole in my pocket and absolutely no way to read it.</p><p>I needed a seal expander, and yet, as Jiraiya had demonstrated – they were really damn difficult. There was no way I was getting at an R&amp;D one (if they had one) without a whole list of reasons.</p><p>So. Either I had to give up, for now.</p><p>Or I had to make one myself.</p><p>There were problems with that. Firstly, I had no idea how. Secondly, seal expansion took up a whole lot of room. It was going to be really hard to find someplace secure where I could do it.</p><p>Jiraiya's had reminded me of a projector. It had magnified the seal and projected it. What if I went a different route? I didn't need it projected, I only needed to see it. I needed a microscope.</p><p>Or something.</p><p>I daydreamed about the solution while I complied my project notes for review, and avoided all the people trying to talk to me about the control measurement seal.</p><p>Yeah, no. I still wasn't doing that.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Hey, Naruto," I asked, at our next team training. "Do you think you could teach us the Shadow Clone Jutsu?"</p><p>I'd seen it done often enough – felt it done, when I'd been trying to help him with summoning jutsu – that I thought I could probably do it myself. And Sasuke had almost certainly copied it at one point or the other. But it was politer to ask.</p><p>"Sure!" Naruto agreed. Then he hesitated. "It takes a lot of chakra, though…"</p><p>"I know," I said. "But I'm pretty sure if we only make one, then we'll be fine." Half our chakra to the clone, plus the initial jutsu cost… Sasuke would be fine for sure. He probably would have been fine all along – shadow clone wasn't more intensive than chidori. Me? I'd felt how much it had taken Naruto to use it, and as long as I wasn't much worse than that (and I didn't think I would be, honestly) then I'd be fine too. It was unlikely to be a staple of my combat jutsu's, but I could think of many benefits to being in two places at once.</p><p>"Okay," Naruto agreed. "Uhm. Well the hand seal is like this… and you just kind of let the chakra go." His hands twisted with familiarity, and a second Naruto appeared with ease. "It's a really easy jutsu. I don't know what else to say."</p><p>It probably wasn't teaching on a very grand level, and probably wouldn't have worked if we hadn't known how already… but it was good enough.</p><p>"It has to be easy if you can do it," Sasuke scoffed. But I noticed his Sharingan was on, and he looked focused and intent as he made the hand seal. There was a slightly messy puff of chakra smoke, and then there were two Sasuke blinking at each other.</p><p>"Awesome!" Naruto cheered. "Now you do it, Shikako!"</p><p>I nodded. "Alright, here goes." The hardest part was just letting the jutsu take my chakra and not trying to manipulate it and control it… but it worked.</p><p>The sudden loss of so much chakra was disorientating, and so was the appearance of the clone. She looked…</p><p>Well. Obviously she looked like me. But you know, normally? You never see your own face. You see reflections, and pictures, but never yourself in 3d, and that's different. You look different.</p><p>If I'd walked past her on the street, I probably would have assumed she was one of my cousins – not that she was me.</p><p>"This is so weird," we both said, in unison.</p><p>I winced. Was that really what my voice sounded like? That was terrible.</p><p>It was also interesting that she clearly had <em> my</em> chakra, not her own. But it was… discrete and separate. I tried to reach out and manipulate it, like I might chakra in any other jutsu.</p><p>She shivered and made a face. "Don't do that."</p><p>"So how do you dispel them?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"They can do it themselves," Naruto said. "Or you just stop the jutsu like this, and all the clones will dispel." He did something, and yes, actually, I could feel the way that the jutsu was still <em> running</em> . It didn't need constant attention and maintenance, like transformation, but it wasn't finished after you created the clones.</p><p>Well obviously not. The memory transfer function tended to indicate that.</p><p>"You want to…" I asked my clone.</p><p>She shrugged, but pressed her hands together. "Dispel." I had a sense of chakra <em> rushing</em> towards me –</p><p>And I blinked up at the blue sky.</p><p>" – medic over here as fast as possible. Tell them it was a training accident," Sasuke said rapidly, voice flat and controlled. He was kneeling beside me, looking across at someone. Naruto.</p><p>I reached up and grabbed his shoulder. "Wait," I rasped. "I'm fine. There's no need."</p><p>"Shikako-chan!" Naruto exclaimed. He dropped down on my other side in a flurry of movement. "Are you hurt? What happened? You just fell over!"</p><p>I tried to sit up. Sasuke's hands on my shoulders very firmly pressed me back down again.</p><p>I sighed. Everything ached. It kind of felt like I had been slammed by a truck. A truck made of chakra that wanted to go <em> through</em> me.</p><p>My chakra had returned. But I hadn't been… ready for it. It had wanted to go into my coils, and they'd been full and unprepared to expand. It had fit, but I felt stretched tight, my skin pulling up goosebumps, and jittery.</p><p>"I felt my chakra come back," I said. "It took me by surprise."</p><p>"Surprise," Sasuke repeated flatly. Yeah, okay, 'surprise' was a weak descriptor for something that made you pass out. Faint. Faint with surprise. Oh, man, I hope they didn't tell this story to everyone.</p><p>"I wasn't ready for it," I said. "It'll be better next time."</p><p>Sasuke didn't look like he agreed. "I still think you should see a medic."</p><p>I really did not want to see a medic. The amount of time I'd spent in the hospital was ludicrous. And they were going to start to think I just couldn't take care of myself.</p><p>"It's fine," I insisted. "They'll just tell you it was my hypersensitivity anyway." Because I had a diagnosis that would explain this – sort of – and that would be the easiest conclusion to jump to. "If you really insist, then we can send for Sakura."</p><p>Naruto brightened, but Sasuke did not. "She's not fully trained," he argued, but it was weak. I was fairly confident that I had won.</p><p>He didn't protest when I sat up this time.</p><p>"I didn't think it would hurt you," Naruto said lowly.</p><p>"I'm not hurt," I said, quickly. "It just felt strange, that was all. I wasn't expecting it." I pushed myself to my feet and hid the fact that I felt a little shaky. "See? Perfectly fine."</p><p>Sasuke shrugged, but didn't rise. "Why don't you tell us more about what the jutsu does?" he suggested to Naruto. "We can practice another day."</p><p>That was a good suggestion. The idea of trying to repeat the shadow clone jutsu right now had dread curling in my stomach. I just <em> knew</em> it was going to hurt.</p><p>This jutsu was probably going to be beyond me, unless I could find some way to control the return of the chakra afterwards. Which was a real pain, because it could have been so <em> useful. </em></p><p>"Okay," Naruto said. "Well, you know about the memory stuff, right? Oh, but if you don't want to make a whole clone to send it, then you can just make the memory into a clone and dispel that."</p><p>I blinked. "What."</p><p>"Like…" Naruto searched for words. "You just stop the jutsu before it actually makes a clone? But it still forms and dispels, so you can still pass information along." He nodded. "Yeah. That's it."</p><p>He might have described it as simple but that was definitely high level chakra manipulation. I was pretty sure that even counted as <em> mastery</em> of the jutsu.</p><p>Naruto really was the most unpredictable ninja.</p><p>"You idiot," Sasuke said. It almost sounded fond. "You don't even see why that's impossible, do you?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>"There you are," Ino said. "I've been looking for you."</p><p>I blinked at her. There was a small lizard – less than the size of my hand – perched on her shoulder. A chameleon. One of her new summons, almost certainly. It was completely still and unmoving, like a little ornament. Or a toy.</p><p>She also had a purple aster tucked into her hair, which was a habit I was starting to notice more and more with her. If it wasn't an actual flower, it was a clip, or hair tie… some kind of decoration. And I knew Ino liked flowers, but she hadn't always felt the need to dress like it. To have a constant reminder of the fact.</p><p>I wondered if I was reading too deeply into that.</p><p>"I'm at home," I said. "Where else would I be?"</p><p>"That's my question," she shot back, hands on hips. "You're so busy these days."</p><p>I tucked my pen into the pages of my notebook and set it down on the veranda beside me. "I guess I can't argue with that," I admitted. "But it looks like you've been pretty busy yourself." I made a vague motion to the chameleon on her shoulder.</p><p>Ino dropped down to sit beside me. "It's a work in progress," she admitted. "I'm negotiating with them. Apparently signing the scroll in the middle of combat isn't how it's typically done."</p><p>"Who would have thought?" I said dryly.</p><p>She smirked. "Exactly. They're a bit wary." She didn't seem too upset by it, and the fact that there was a summon clinging to her shoulder meant that it couldn't be going too badly. "They were really loyal to Kubisaki, you know? Even at the end there…"</p><p>Staying for fifty years, for a man that was already dead? Carrying out his dying wish? Yeah, they'd been loyal. That was good if she could win them over, but not so good if she couldn't.</p><p>"But it's going well?" I asked.</p><p>She smiled. "Yeah. This little guy is a Watcher. I agreed to keep him with me for a few days, so he can see where I live. The kind of person I am. That kind of thing."</p><p>A show of trust. The Watcher wasn't a combat summons, so it was unlikely to turn on her by itself, but I of all people knew the value of information. If they decided that they didn't want Ino as their summoner… well… There wasn't that much they could do with it without another one – as far as I knew – but it was still something to hold over her head.</p><p>Ino probably knew that too. But at some point, you had to take the risk and give trust in order to get it back.</p><p>"Ah," I said. "Much further to go?"</p><p>"A little," she said. "I was going to go see Sakura and Isaribi next."</p><p>The name rang a bell, but it took me a few minutes to place it. Isaribi was the girl that Ino and Naruto had brought home from the Land of Sea, who I suspected had been part of some of Orochimaru's experiments.</p><p>"I haven't seen Sakura in a while," I offered. "I'll come with you."</p><p>It meant taking a trip to the hospital, but at least it was as a visitor, not a patient. I'd take what I could get.</p><p>We decided to stop by and see Isaribi first, which turned out to be a good choice. Sakura was there, after all, and she wasn't the only one, either. Even though Isaribi had a little hotel-esque room all to herself, it was a little crowded.</p><p>"I hope we aren't interrupting," Ino said, knocking gently on the open door.</p><p>"Only slightly," Anko drawled. She leant against the wall and tucked her hands into her pockets.</p><p>"No, not at all!" Yakumo countered, clapping her hands together in excitement. "Anko-sensei was just saying that Isaribi is going to start training with me. Now we only need one more person for a proper team!"</p><p><em> That explains why she's here,</em> I thought, because Sakura worked here, so her I could understand, and Anko had been the leader of the team that brought her back, but Yakumo had no connection.</p><p>She looked thrilled at the news. The girl that could only be Isaribi looked slightly less so, eyes down, fingers fidgeting with the fabric of her pants. She was dark haired and dark eyed, but wearing bandages across her face and shoulder. That was barely worth mentioning as far as ninja fashion went, even less so when the person in question was actually in a hospital.</p><p>"That sounds great," Ino said. "What do you think?" She perched herself on the bed next to Isaribi.</p><p>I hovered awkwardly around the edge of the room, next to Sakura. I hoped she wasn't too upset to see Isaribi being folded into a ninja team, when she herself hadn't made the cut. The circumstances were different, and I suspected that Anko was going to be doing a lot more supervision than training, as she was doing with Yakumo.</p><p>It wasn't actually a bad set up. As with Yakumo, Anko had a lot of skills that made her ideal for helping to integrate someone that had been on the bad side of Orochimaru's experiments. If Isaribi really did want to be a ninja, then it was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>"So, ah," I said to Sakura awkwardly, seeing that Ino had already made herself the centre of attention. "Had much time for training?"</p><p>"A little," Sakura said, tucking her bangs behind her ear. "I've been working on the, uhm. The thing you gave me." She darted a glance at Anko, which. Didn't so much <em> avoid</em> suspicion as the complete opposite. Nothing quite got a ninja's attention like people with secrets.</p><p>I made a humming noise. "Working on it theoretically or 'working on it' working on it?"</p><p>"Both," Sakura said, surprising me. "I mean, I redid some of the theory according to medical ninjutsu… I'll show you it later. It's at home."</p><p>"Sounds good," I said.</p><p>Sakura rubbed at the knuckles on one hand. I noticed they were slightly… pinkish, as though the skin had been damaged and healed. "It's a work in progress," she admitted.</p><p>I huffed a laugh, and made a mental note to get her some gloves or something. "Everything is," I said. "Don't feel too bad. The last time I tried to learn a new jutsu I knocked myself out. If you're doing better than that, then you're fine."</p><p>Sakura spluttered, halfway between shock and laughter. "You did not."</p><p>I grinned. "You think I'd make that up?"</p><p>"Probably not," she allowed and rolled her eyes. "You're ridiculous."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I sat very quietly, and very still, under Kasuga's eye, and practiced bending my shadow to my will. I wasn't doing anything particularly advanced or new – just exercises I'd done more than a thousand times before.</p><p>Yet for some reason, he was watching with an intently focused look.</p><p>"And how are your other exercises going?" he asked, eventually.</p><p>I paused. <em> Oh. Right. </em> "I haven't had any problems since," I said.</p><p>It wasn't even a lie. I'd just changed my definition of 'problem'. Being able to separate myself into two wasn't a problem as long as I could control it.</p><p>It was a technique. Nothing more. Nothing less.</p><p>"Is that so," Kasuga said, and it was less a question than a statement.</p><p>I smiled at him, the expression as open as I could make it when I was being less than truthful. "I panicked before," I said. "In hindsight, the situation seems much less dire than I thought it to be."</p><p>The look he gave me was assessing and piercing.</p><p>I went back to my exercise, splaying shadow tendrils on the ground around me. In my own practices with the stone, I'd learnt that the chakra imbued-and-retrieved in it came out thicker and darker than any of my own truly was – as though it was purified to some perfect level of shadow jutsu. It could turn me to shadow, yes, but I could also use it as chakra for my jutsu and they would be stronger for it. But the imbuing took time, so I wasn't content to simply add that step to any use of my jutsu in combat. It would be too much of a liability.</p><p>I'd used it instead as a baseline - a comparison - to help strengthen my own chakra, holding it in one hand and continuing with the path dad had shown us to strength our shadow affinities, trying to match that level with my own abilities.</p><p>Not something I could do under the watchful eye of Kasuga, given that I couldn't explain where the Gelel stone came from, but ironically, the stone itself provided a safeguard against falling into the black.</p><p>If I went too far, stretched myself too fast… then I lost the balance in imbuing the stone and would simply transform into shadow.</p><p>It was almost difficult to remember how frightened I had been the first time that had happened, when now it was so reassuring.</p><p>"You have progressed… significantly," Kasuga said, the words weighty.</p><p>I threaded six tendrils through the loops of six kunai and lifted them into the air. One jerked higher than the others, the kunai slipping loose, until I made a last minute correction and turned the tip of the tendril into a hook.</p><p><em> Sloppy.</em></p><p>It was hard to exert pressure when you couldn't feel anything in response. Or not nothing. But the feeling I got through my shadow was very vague. Being able to judge how hard to pull or push was simply a matter of experience here.</p><p>I spread my fingers out, then slowly turned my hands over. The shadow tendrils curled over, an orbital ballet, the kunai swinging around. One came too close to my arms. They were blunt training ones, thankfully, but it still showed a lack of precision that annoyed me.</p><p>"Thank you," I said, too much of my attention focused on my training to try and guess whether or not that had truly been a compliment.</p><p>I looped the tendrils around, rotating them in a circle around my body, moving them right from the base where they touched the ground. Too often I treated them like arms, fixed at a point, but they were not. The bottom was as free to move as the top.</p><p>I could feel the strain of it now, tension creeping between my shoulder blades, as they took more and more concentration to control. Mental fatigue and nothing more, though the chakra cost itself was nothing to sneeze at.</p><p>I breathed carefully, in and out, and drew forth a seventh tendril from the ground, reaching it up to circle around and loop through the hooks of all six kunai. Then, one by one, I withdrew the others, until it was the only one remaining, and brought my kunai back to the ground.</p><p>"Kai," I said, tiredly. The metal clattered in the dirt.</p><p>I flexed my shoulders and rubbed at the back of my neck where the tension had built up. I nearly had it. But nearly was not good enough.</p><p>"Do it again," Kasuga said.</p><p>I ran through the seals. "Shadow Stitching Jutsu."</p><p><hr /></p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Birds Arc: Chapter 84</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Someone pointed out that the calendar on deviantart wasn't as accurate as it should be… I redid it only to find that the twins birthday had slipped past. Whoops. . I could push graduation back, since it's kind of never specified when it occurs, but that makes things awkward too.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 84</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The Road goes ever on and on</p><p>Down from the door where it began.</p><p>Now far ahead the Road has gone,</p><p>And I must follow, if I can,</em></p><p><em> ~ Lord of the Rings, J.R.R Tolkien</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>We celebrated our birthday the day Shikamaru returned.</p><p>I honestly hadn't noticed it slipping past. Usually, it was Ino who reminded me, talking about her own birthday approaching. Since hers was the day after mine, it was a pretty convenient reminder.</p><p>… which also meant I'd forgotten Ino's birthday this year.</p><p><em> Damn.</em></p><p>"Problem?" Shikamaru murmured, catching my eye.</p><p>"Forgot to get Ino a present," I murmured back. It was only the three of us, but we'd gone out for dinner. It was the kind of fancy restaurant and traditional food that we didn't often go to, but I enjoyed all the same.</p><p>He gave me a look. "Her birthday is literally the day after ours."</p><p>"I know that," I said, annoyed.</p><p>He blinked. Then he sighed. "I can't believe you forgot your own birthday."</p><p>"I know when it is," I said. I just… hadn't put together 'hey, it's September 22nd' with 'my birthday is September 22nd'. And well, frankly, birthdays stopped seeming so important after you'd had about twenty of them, and resetting the count to zero hardly changed that. I'd never really been the type to throw a party for it, and there was even less of a point getting worked up when there were two other people planning things at the same time.</p><p>Mum laughed and covered her mouth with her hand. "I wondered why you didn't say anything," she said. Her eyes were bright with mirth, crinkling at the corners.</p><p>I huffed, exaggerated, and made a show of intently picking up food with my chopsticks. But I didn't really mind them laughing at me in this instance, because I could acknowledge that it was really silly. I would have laughed too.</p><p>"I guess I shouldn't expect a present then," Shikamaru said.</p><p>"I got you one ages ago," I replied flippantly, even though I didn't think he really cared. He was just poking. "Don't you worry about that."</p><p>And I did. When we got home, I rummaged around for the 'safe place' I'd hid it, and eventually managed to unearth it from my desk drawer, where it was buried beneath an avalanche of miscellaneous blank notebooks and paper that seemed to accumulate. It made a good hiding place, but even I didn't tend to go through that very often, so I'd forgotten that was where I put it.</p><p>The box was only about the size of a shoebox, and I took care not to rattle it as I took it downstairs.</p><p>I gave mine to Shikamaru first.</p><p>He picked it up and tilted his head, considering. Then he gave it the tiniest of shakes and listened to the clatter of metal.</p><p>"Kunai?" He guessed.</p><p>It was an old game, one we'd always played, to try and see who could guess what their gifts were before they opened them. Sometimes it was easy. Sometimes it wasn't.</p><p>"Half right," I said, teasingly. "Open it."</p><p>He didn't though, turning the box over in his hands, eyes narrowed at it. I could tell he was trying to work out what I meant by 'half right', but I honestly didn't think it was something he would be able to tell. Well, maybe if he had the same thought process I did, but they'd been brought on a whim when I'd seen them, rather than a logical plan.</p><p>Then he gave me an exasperated look and pulled the wrapping paper off. "They are kunai."</p><p>"Half right," I repeated, and flicked one up out of the box, rolling it over my fingers until the handle fell into the palm of my hand.</p><p>Then I stabbed it into my thigh.</p><p>Reflexively, Shikamaru grabbed my arm. His fingers clenched bruise tight around my wrist, but he would have been too slow anyway.</p><p>I lifted an eyebrow at him and raised the knife. My leg was unharmed.</p><p>"Trick blade," I said. The blade slid up in pieces, smaller sections inside larger ones. It didn't retract the whole blade, but it was still a fair portion of it. And it was blunt besides.</p><p>Shikamaru exhaled a breath. It shook, just a little. "You didn't have to be so dramatic," he grumbled. It took another second for him to lift his hand away.</p><p>I'd intended to tease. But maybe it had hit home a little deeper than that.</p><p>"I saw the chance; I took it," I said, lightly, twirling the blade over my fingers. "You'd have done the same."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"You didn't remind me," I said to Ino reproachfully, walking into the flower shop.</p><p>Ino flicked a glance up at me, then went back to arranging a bouquet. There was a tiny lizard perched on the counter, and I would have taken it to be a garden ornament if I didn't know better.</p><p>"Remind you what?" she asked. She held up two carnations. "Pink or red?"</p><p>"Red," I said, with barely a glance. "It was your birthday."</p><p>Ino considered, then discarded the red and tucked the pink into the center of the arrangement. "Uh, yeah. Happens every year. You had one as well. "</p><p>I paused. There was a moment when I could have made an excuse. "I forgot," I said sheepishly. "Sorry. But I got you a present."</p><p>I dropped a small, wrapped gift box onto the counter. It was only a set of hair clips, with a jewelled flower (and a sharp edge, we <em> were</em> ninja), but they were the kind of thing I thought she would like.</p><p>"Aw," Ino said, wiping her hands on her apron. "Thanks. We didn't get back to Konoha till after, so I was honestly waiting to see how long it took you to notice." She ducked down and opened the cupboard door, rummaging around until she found a package, and gave it to me.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "Until someone wished me happy birthday, apparently," I said. In the same vein as mine, the gift turned out to be a heavy silver clasp for my braid – with nifty little catches inside to conceal a lock pick. Handy.</p><p>"And no one did?" Ino frowned.</p><p>"Shikamaru did," I said. "And that might have been the reason mum cooked gyouza the other day, come to think of it." And I couldn't imagine mum <em> not</em> wishing me happy birthday, so that meant I hadn't been paying very much attention. Which wasn't exactly unknown, if it was early morning or I was in the middle of reading something.</p><p>"You are actually hopeless," Ino decided. She slid the clips into her hair, replacing the set she was already wearing and dropping them in her pocket. "How did you fool people into thinking that you're smart and observant?"</p><p>"I lied on my exams," I deadpanned.</p><p>The shop bell jangled angrily as the door was thrust open. Sakura burst inside. "Ino, you have to help me!" she wailed.</p><p>She didn't look injured, I assessed. Which didn't exclude verbal harassment, if someone was trying to bully her again. It didn't seem like she was being followed, and I couldn't sense anyone hovering suspiciously, but I angled myself against the counter so I could see out the window down the street, just in case.</p><p>Then Sakura caught sight of me. "You! This is your fault!"</p><p>And promptly burst into tears.</p><p>Ino darted forward to console her, even as I blinked in confusion. "My… fault?" I asked.</p><p>Sakura clenched a fist, and I noticed it was scraped red and raw, like she'd hit something with it. "You! You and your techniques and your seal and – and one hundred percent!"</p><p>Ino gave me a querying look, patting Sakura on the shoulder and leading her to a seat. I shrugged, a little helplessly. But I was starting to get an idea.</p><p>"She's going to kill me," Sakura continued, inconsolable. "I'm dead and its all your fault."</p><p>"No one is going to kill you," I said firmly. "What happened?"</p><p>"I was practicing and I broke the log and someone saw me and I'm in <em> so much trouble!</em> " She hiccupped, tears still brimming in her eyes.</p><p>I rocked backwards onto my heels, a little bit of relief brimming in my chest. That was all. But it was clearly a big deal to Sakura, so I squashed the impulse to brush it off.</p><p>Ino gave me a look that said 'explain, now'. It was still creased with worry, so it wasn't all that impressive, but I obliged.</p><p>"You were working on the super strength technique?" I asked, just to confirm. "And someone saw you?"</p><p>Sakura nodded miserably. Even her hair seemed to be drooping. "Tsunade-sama is going to be so angry at me."</p><p>"It probably won't even get to Tsunade," I pointed out. "She's the Hokage and very busy. I think you're making too big a deal out of this. It's just a broken post. That happens all the time."</p><p>"They already told her! I have to go and meet her this afternoon at Training Ground One!" Sakura refuted. "I'm dead. This is it. I'm never going to be a ninja."</p><p>My mouth dropped open. My only consolation was that Ino looked equally stunned.</p><p>"You get to train with Tsunade-sama?" Ino breathed, looking awestruck. "Sakura, that's amazing."</p><p>Sakura had already caught Tsunade's eye? No way. I didn't doubt that she had the skills – how could I? – but I honestly hadn't expected that. Not until she actually made medic nin, or picked apart the technique enough that it became obvious what it was. One broken training post did not the next Tsunade make.</p><p>How much had Sakura done that I was missing?</p><p>She squeaked and looked utterly gobsmacked. "I- I didn't think of it like that," Sakura said weakly, looking even paler if that was possible. It looked as if that thought was even more intimidating than the prospect of being in trouble. "What am I going to do?"</p><p>"What do you want to do?" Ino asked seriously. "This is an amazing chance but you don't have to take it, you know. No one is going to be angry if you turn it down."</p><p><em> But it would be really, really dumb</em> , I didn't add.</p><p>Sakura took a deep breath and let it out slowly. She wiped her eyes. "It is really amazing, isn't it? It's Tsunade-sama."</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed.</p><p>"I'd have to be crazy to turn it down," she said. "It's <em> Tsunade-sama.</em> " The shock of it seemed to be starting to fade. A little.</p><p>Ino smiled at her. "You're going to be amazing," she promised. "We'll get you cleaned up, then you're going to go and impress the hell out of her."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I made plans with Ino to meet up the next day and find out how Sakura's training went, but I never got the chance to follow through; Naruto came and told me we had a mission.</p><p>"Make sure you ask Ino how Sakura's thing went," I told Shikamaru, nudging him awake with my foot.</p><p>He rolled his head in the grass, looking at me with bleary eyes. So much for 'cloud watching'. "But I don't actually care," he said.</p><p>"Ask anyway," I directed. "I wanna know."</p><p>"So you ask."</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him. "I have a mission."</p><p>He made a displeased face, and I ignored it. I wasn't having that argument now.</p><p>"So I'll see you later," I finished, raising one hand in a lazy wave and turning to go. I half expected him to say something after me. But he didn't.</p><p>We didn't know where to go to find Sai – unsurprisingly – but he apparently had received word about the mission because he arrived at the tower the same time we did.</p><p>"Geeze, you look awful," Naruto said bluntly. "Are you sick?"</p><p>He wasn't kidding. Sai looked terrible. I mean, he was pale anyway, but this was an extra level of looking like a ghost. There were dark creases beneath his eyes and he looked… rumpled. Ruffled.</p><p>I pressed the backs of my fingers against his cheek. "You don't have a fever," I said quietly. "Are you feeling okay?"</p><p>Sai took a quiet, deep breath. I could feel him stiffen, to try to regain some composure. "I am prepared for our mission," he said, voice clear of inflection.</p><p>Naruto looked uncertain.</p><p>I hoped the reason wasn't <em> us.</em> That the reason Sai looked so terrible wasn't because of something that had happened on the last mission – that we had made him cross Danzo in some way – that we had made things <em> worse</em> for him.</p><p>That wasn't what I wanted for him.</p><p>Tsunade spared us barely a glance as we trooped into her office. There was a young nervous looking man hovering awkwardly in the middle of the room. He definitely wasn't a ninja, I could tell that much.</p><p>"This is Chishima," Tsunade introduced briskly. "He's hired a team for a C-rank to the Land of Birds. They're having some problems with rumours of a ghost-"</p><p>"A ghost!" Naruto interrupted, sounding remarkably alarmed for someone who actually ran into a ghost on our last mission. Well. Naruto didn't, exactly, but it still counted.</p><p>"<em> Rumours of a ghost,</em> " Tsunade repeated, glaring. "That are causing some upset with the civilian populace. You're to investigate the source of the rumours, hopefully put a stop to them, and bring world peace to all the little boys and girls. There should be no fighting involved. Are we clear?"</p><p>"Gotcha," Naruto said confidently. "Rumours. Investigate. Peace on earth. No problem, leave it to us."</p><p>"Mission accepted," I murmured, quietly, and tried not to seem too amused because Tsunade-sama seemed annoyed.</p><p>But really.</p><p><em> World peace. </em></p><p>Chishima stepped forward hesitantly. "Uh, I'm pleased to meet you." He gave a small smile. "I'm really glad that you've accepted this mission, we really are quite desperate."</p><p>Tsunade threw us the mission scroll, and we led Chishima out of the tower and towards the gate. It was late afternoon to be setting out, but he seemed eager to get home, and had apparently travelled all the way to Konoha alone for the purpose of hiring a team. That spoke of dedication. It was a long way, and not particularly safe for a solo traveller.</p><p>Hence why people hired ninja as guards.</p><p>"Ah, well, I guess I should start at the beginning," Chishima said as we walked away from the village.</p><p>"Is there really a ghost?" Naruto asked, before he could really start.</p><p>Chishima rubbed his head awkwardly. "That's what people have been saying," he said. "The Cursed Warrior… it's an old tale in the Land of Birds. There was a samurai lord who was murdered, but no one could bring the man who killed him to justice. So he rose from the grave and hunted down his killer himself. They say that anyone who isn't avenged after their deaths can become a Cursed Warrior, and still walk this earth."</p><p>A pretty tale, but I thought it would rather take a bit more than determination to hang around after you died. It clearly wasn't impossible, but Kubisaki had at least had a seal involved.</p><p>I would very much have liked to dismiss the entire ghost story out of hand but, unfortunately, my cynicism had taken a hit. Now ghosts were one of the possibilities I had to explore before arriving at a conclusion. How very taxing.</p><p>"There has been an assassination?" Sai asked, seeming uninterested in the majority of the story.</p><p>"No!" Chishima exclaimed. "Well. No. That's why the rumours are so terrible. Our Daimyo passed away only recently, leaving the title to his son Sagi. Only… Sagi-sama is very young; the same age as me. There were many people who felt that he was too young to inherit the title."</p><p>"So the rumours are meant to discredit him?" I asked, frowning. Chishima didn't seem all that young, from our point of view, but I <em> could</em> see the problem with crowning a Daimyo that wasn't even twenty. And if the Daimyo had died suddenly or unexpectedly, then assassination was always a possibility.</p><p>"I think so," Chishima said. "Or to discredit Mousou-sama." He caught our blank looks. "Mousou-sama was the chief advisor to the previous Daimyo. He's currently acting as the regent for Sagi-sama. He's a very wise man."</p><p><em> That</em> , I thought, was even more interesting. "So, Mousou is the regent. Hm. Who were the people most against Sagi becoming Daimyo?"</p><p>"That would have been Komei-sama," Chishima said. "He's the chief strategist and the leader of the military forces of the Land of Birds."</p><p>"You have a large military?" Sai asked, and there was something flat about the question, even for him. He wasn't looking at Chishima, eyes straight ahead on the road.</p><p>Chishima cocked his head to the side. "I guess?" He said, uncertainly. "I don't know how big other countries militaries are to compare it to. But the palace has a lot of guards."</p><p>A lot of guards, yet he'd still travelled alone? It didn't look like the thought had even occurred to him. Maybe I was being overtly paranoid here – Chishima gave the vibe of being very sheltered.</p><p>"But no ninja, right?" Naruto jumped in. "Or you wouldn't have had to come to get us."</p><p>"Right! To be honest, I don't really know much about ninja," he admitted. "They say you can do magic, is that true?"</p><p>"It's not really magic," Naruto said, laughing awkwardly. "It's just chakra. See?" He started forming a Rasengan in one hand, blue chakra swirling together. It was a little wobbly, but he wasn't using a clone to help stabilise it, either.</p><p>Chishima adjusted his glasses. "That's amazing," he breathed. "I've never seen anything like that."</p><p>Naruto preened under the praise. "That's not all I can do," he said.</p><p>"So where do you fit into this?" I asked, interrupting the showing off. "Do you work at the palace?"</p><p>"Yes," he answered. "I'm the assistant to Mousou-sama, and I have been for years. In fact, Sagi-sama was a dear friend of mine when we were growing up. I have to say… I'm really very worried about him. Ever since he became Daimyo, he has become very cold and closed off, nothing like the happy boy I remember."</p><p>"Responsibility is hard," I said, sympathetically. "It can change people, sometimes."</p><p>"Yes," Chishima agreed. "I know. And he's also grieving. It wasn't just his father that died, either. Shortly after that, his younger sister Toki became very ill and passed away. That would be very hard on anyone."</p><p>Oh. Well. Two sudden deaths in a royal family in under a year? <em> Curiouser </em> and <em> curiouser</em> , as they said.</p><p>It might have been nothing. But then again.</p><p>"That's awful," Naruto said, empathetically.</p><p>"So that's why I want these awful rumours to go away," Chishima continued. "So that Sagi-sama doesn't have to suffer through them."</p><p>I sort of wished Naruto was the type to pick up on subtle implications like this, so that I could talk it over with him. Scratch that. I wished Sasuke was here. He would have spotted it.</p><p>"So you came all this way by yourself, for your friend?" Naruto asked. "That's super brave."</p><p>Chishima laughed awkwardly. "No one else wanted to come," he confessed. "And I've never left Land of Birds before, so I got a little lost on the way. I had to ask a lot of people for directions."</p><p>In which case, it was doubly amazing that he ever made it to Konoha. I wondered if that was the point.</p><p>Naruto seemed impressed, however. "Wow. Sagi sure seems lucky to have a friend like you. So you don't have to worry anymore. We'll find out what's going on and make sure your friend is okay. And that's a promise."</p><p><hr /></p><p>In deference to the fact that we were travelling with a civilian, we made camp early in a large clearing and set a campfire going.</p><p>Chishima had been happy to keep talking about the Land of Birds and its recent troubles, and combined with what I already know about the place, it was all adding up to an interesting picture.</p><p>Bird Country wasn't exactly insular, but it wasn't a huge exporter either. They were rather traditional compared to neighbouring countries and, as the Cursed Warrior story showed, had a tendency towards being rather superstitious.</p><p>But I was rather more interested in the current political makeup of the place, and the facts that Chishima didn't seem to be aware that he knew. Something fishy was definitely going down, the only question was what. Without being there, or being able to question anyone else, I couldn't draw a conclusion, but I would be really damn surprised if there really was a ghost.</p><p>If the Daimyo hadn't been assassinated, then someone was at the very least taking advantage of his sudden death to shake things up.</p><p>"What is it that you're writing?" Chishima asked Sai over the fire. "Are you also a scribe?"</p><p>Sai looked at him blankly. "It's a drawing," he said. His hand smoothed over the small book. "It's for my brother."</p><p>"You have a brother?" Naruto piped up. "You didn't tell us that!"</p><p>"He's dead," Sai said, bluntly. But there was an inflection to the words that hadn't been there before. They seemed softer. "This book was going to be a present for him. But before I could finish it… he succumbed to an illness and died. Afterwards, I couldn't continue drawing it. There seemed to be no point. But I remember now, what it was that I wanted to draw in it."</p><p>"I'm sorry," Naruto said. "About your brother. That sucks. I'm sure he would have loved it."</p><p>"How can you know that?" Sai asked. "You never met him."</p><p>"Because he was your brother, duh," Naruto answered, as if it were self-evident. "And he would have known how much hard work you put into it and how much you cared. When someone gives you a gift like that, it's impossible not to love it."</p><p>I smiled at them, through the flickering light of the campfire.</p><p>When it came time to split up the night watches, there was an unspoken agreement between Naruto and I.</p><p>"Me and Shikako will take watch tonight," Naruto said. "You get some sleep, okay, Sai?"</p><p>Sai blinked. "It is standard to divide the night watches into three," he said. "I am capable of taking watch."</p><p>"We know," I said, reassuringly, so he didn't feel like he was at fault. "But you look really tired, so it's better for you to get some rest. There's no point in pushing so hard at the start of the mission."</p><p>Sai looked like he wanted to protest more, but this wasn't really a situation where either of us were going to budge.</p><p>"Goodnight," Naruto told him. "Don't worry about anything, okay?"</p><p><hr /></p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Birds Arc: Chapter 85</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Does anyone have songs that remind them of DOS? We've got one awesome playlist already, and I know I have my own internal soundtrack, but I'm curious to see if anyone else does.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 85</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The world is a looking glass and gives back to every man the reflection of his own face. ~ William Makepeace Thackeray</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>When we arrived at the palace, it was late at night, and there were a whole bunch of guards running around. They weren't aimless; they definitely had a purpose and a destination.</p><p>"That doesn't look good," I noted. There was nothing immediately wrong at first glance – no fires or fighting – and there were no alarm bells or warning shouts. But the tension in the air suggested this was no drill.</p><p>"Hey!" Naruto shouted, flagging a guard down. "What's going on here?"</p><p>"Who are you and what are you doing on the palace grounds?" the guardsman demanded in return, tightening his grip on his polearm. He caught sight of Chishima and seemed to recognise him. "No, never mind. Just stay out of the way! The Cursed Warrior has been sighted."</p><p>That was exactly what we wanted to hear. Or no, I would have preferred a little time to scout around and question people first, but it was a pretty lucky break, all things considered.</p><p>"Awesome," Naruto said, following pretty much the same train of thought. "Let's go check it out!"</p><p>We followed the stampeding of the guards towards whichever location they were heading, dragging Chishima with us. It was a little risky to be dragging him to a place where there was known trouble, but I was confident we'd be able to protect him, in a way we couldn't if we just left him behind.</p><p>It was likely we'd need him to explain our presence, as well, since we hadn't had time to introduce ourselves to anyone else.</p><p>"Send a patrol out the east gate and check the forest. Make sure a team has been dispatched to guard the Daimyo!" The orders were directed at the force of guards from and older man with impressive sideburns who was standing barefoot on the wooden veranda. He was wearing sleeping clothes with a robe hastily thrown over top, though that didn't seem to diminish his professionalism any.</p><p>I rather approved.</p><p>"That's Komei-sama," Chishima said, bracing himself against the wall and breathing heavily. The brief sprint might have been a little too much for him.</p><p>"Stay here," I said, because it was safe enough, and we leapt up the wall and started running along the rooftops, overtaking the guardsmen as they ran towards the gates. We fanned out, maximising the area we could search without losing contact with each other, and swept the area.</p><p>The security response might have been good in terms of defence but the sheer number of people provided cover and erased any signs that might have let us track it. The ground had been stamped down by heavy military boots and it was impossible to tell if any tracks had been left behind.</p><p>Then –</p><p>"There, up above!" I said.</p><p>It hovered against the night sky. A figure, clad all in white with a helmet and a halberd in hand, with the mask of a demon, just as Chishima had described it to us.</p><p>And while there were ninja techniques to achieve flight, or the semblance of it, I could see why this ruse had been so convincing to people.</p><p>It was almost drifting eerily away on the breeze.</p><p>In the dark it was almost impossible to pick up on the tell-tale strings holding it aloft. I couldn't even see what the strings were attached to, since there wasn't anything <em> above</em> us. In its own way, that kind of fakery was a type of ninjutsu – it was the only type that would have existed in my old world.</p><p>We converged together, aiming to follow it wherever it landed. There was no doubt that the Cursed Warrior saw us in return, for it abruptly dropped low, angling towards the ground and vanishing from our sight.</p><p>I burst forward, pouring on the speed. The vibrations of the roof underfoot told me that the others were doing the same. We had it now – we weren't going to let it get away.</p><p>We were well out of the palace grounds, and the housing was giving way to forest. It made sense that the Cursed Warrior would head towards a deserted area to hide, but trying to escape Konoha ninja in a forest was a mistake.</p><p>"Just give up!" Naruto hollered. "We found you! We know you're not a real ghost!"</p><p>The forest gave way to a small clearing where there was an abandoned and disused shrine. It was fairly big, with a courtyard surrounded by high walls. The doors were wide open and I caught the briefest of glimpses as the figure in white ducked inside. I locked onto the chakra signature, which was faint and untrained, but definitely real.</p><p><em> Gotcha.</em></p><p>Sai and I circled around the shrine, just to make sure there was nothing else there, even as Naruto made a bee-line for the door. It didn't feel like a trap but, then, that was the best kind, wasn't it?</p><p>"It's empty?" Naruto said, puzzled, screeching to a stop in the middle of the shrine. He spun around and around, eyes getting wider and wider.</p><p>I slid in through the open door and let my eyes adjust to the even dimmer interior. We could probably have used torches or seals to create light and track the Cursed Warrior based on footprints in the dust, but I still had a lock on their chakra.</p><p>"Trap door," I said. "They're below us."</p><p>Below us and moving, which indicated tunnels. Clever. They could come and go without being seen, and it would appear as if the Cursed Warrior simply vanished.</p><p>It took us a few minutes to find the location of the trap door and to pry it up. I pulled out three LED seals for us, and we dropped down into the pitch blackness of the tunnel. Well, there was actually a ladder, but it wasn't so deep that we needed to use it.</p><p>"If the tunnel continues in this direction," Sai pointed out as we cautiously started moving. "We will return to the palace grounds."</p><p>"Interesting," I said, because he was absolutely right. Then again, all our main suspects for starting the rumours all lived in the palace anyway, so perhaps it wasn't so far-fetched.</p><p>Even if we were warily looking out for traps – of which we found none – we still caught up with the Cursed Warrior long before the tunnel reached its end. And in a tunnel, with a little bit of light, was close to a perfect set up for my shadow jutsu.</p><p>"We caught you!" Naruto crowed.</p><p>The Warrior tried to struggle, but they had no resistance to my jutsu. I reached up, awkwardly managing to undo the catches of the helmet and pulled it free.</p><p>Long black hair tumbled free, framing the angry face of a young woman. She was in her late teens, maybe not quite twenty.</p><p>"Uh," Naruto asked, hand coming up to cup his chin. "Who are you?"</p><p>She clearly wasn't anyone we'd met here. But since we'd been in the palace for all of five minutes before giving chase, that wasn't surprising. We could have just dragged her up and found her identity that way – but given that the situation looked a lot deeper than 'someone is dressing up as a ghost' I didn't particularly want to do that.</p><p>At least, we could talk to her first.</p><p>"Let me free!" she spat. "You have absolutely no idea what you are meddling with!"</p><p>"Hey!" Naruto protested immediately. "What's the big idea? You're the one running around pretending to be a ghost and scaring everyone! Lots of people are really worried about this."</p><p>"It's regrettable," she said, and however regrettable she found it, it wasn't enough to sway her. "But necessary. You wouldn't understand."</p><p>"So tell us what's going on," I suggested quietly, trying to sound as reasonable and approachable as possible. It was a little difficult when I was actually the one holding her hostage. "We're ninja from Konoha who were hired to discover the truth behind the situation. We can help you."</p><p>She gave a short, bitter laugh. "You were hired by Mousou to do his bidding. He just wants me silenced. What does the truth matter to you?"</p><p>Interesting. So she was informed enough to know who had sent for us. Probably not working for him, though, with that amount of scorn.</p><p>"Problems that aren't resolved correctly have a habit of resurfacing," I said, trying to pick the angle that would most appeal to her. Since I had no idea what her motive was, it was a little tricky. "We hardly want it said that we failed in our mission."</p><p>Self-interest was a believable motive, right? Presented that way, it made it seem that we were open to being swayed by the truth. It was a fine line, but our mission briefing had been about finding the truth, and not about aiding in a cover up.</p><p>"This situation is greater than merely that of ghosts and rumours," she said. "You have no right to interfere with it."</p><p>"Well tough," Naruto said, crossing his arms. "We're here now, so you've just gotta deal with that."</p><p>Immovable object, meet unstoppable force.</p><p>But this kind of argument could get very messy.</p><p>"Is this," I said slowly. This would be a leading question. If I was right, it would probably help us. If I was wrong, I was giving her an option to deceive us. "About the assassinations?"</p><p>"You know," she said, and her voice cracked and broke. A shiver wracked her body, and though I couldn't see it in the darkness, I could feel it through my jutsu, a ghost of a feeling.</p><p>"What assassinations?" Naruto asked, alarmed. His eyes went wide. "Did someone really kill the old Daimyo?"</p><p>"He was murdered," she said. "Killed in cold blood. I know it to be true! I <em> will</em> find out who is responsible. I will have vengeance!"</p><p>Carefully, I let the shadow around her feet fade out. I could catch her again, if she made to flee. Or attack. But we had her now, in a much realer sense, and we would learn much more from conversation than from fighting.</p><p>"That's awful," Naruto said. "What happened? And who are you, anyway?"</p><p>She sighed, a deep rattling thing. Her eyes closed, briefly, in contemplation. I could tell the minute she gave in and decided to work with us. Or to try and use us. "This is not the place for that discussion. Come with me."</p><p>She turned and continued walking down the tunnel. I fell into step easily. There was only one pathway, so only one exit. Unless there was a trap waiting for us at the end – and I had my sensing on full alert just to make sure there wasn't – there was no harm in relocating.</p><p>She carefully shed the armour of the Cursed Warrior, leaving it in the tunnel, before ascending up the ladder. "It belongs in the abandoned temple," she said, by way of explanation. "There is no time to return it, but it is too much risk to have it in my rooms."</p><p>Almost surprisingly, the ladder came out in an opulent room. I didn't know where I had <em> expected</em> it to lead, but this wasn't it. The trap door was hidden beneath a low table, and we rolled awkwardly out from beneath it. When it was closed it was indistinguishable from the tatami flooring.</p><p><em> Very neat.</em></p><p>But the room itself…</p><p>This was a tunnel built right into the heart of the palace – a way for the royal family to escape, should it ever be brought under siege. Likely one of the most guarded secrets of the land.</p><p>"Wow," Naruto said. "This is almost as nice as Yukie's palace."</p><p>It was a living room, wide open spaces and plentiful seating. From beyond the shogi doors I could hear the gentle clinking of a zen garden water-piece. There was a fireplace and mantle, and above it a giant painted portrait of a family. The Daimyo's family, clearly, if the robes the man was wearing was any indication. There were two young, identical ten year olds in the picture. The picture was several years old.</p><p>And several pieces of information clicked into place.</p><p>"Chishima said that Toki died," I murmured, staring at the painting.</p><p>The young woman – Toki herself – sat in seiza across the table. There was a pocket watch on it, one she picked up and flicked open.</p><p>"Toki is dead," she said. "All that remains is a ghost seeking vengeance for those that are gone."</p><p>"What?" Naruto repeated. "You're the princess? But how come you're alive? What happened to Sagi?"</p><p>"I know not whether they meant to kill me," she said. "Or whether Sagi was the true target of the attack. But he- he died all the same."</p><p>Tears glistened in her eyes, but the rest of her expression was iron hard. Her fingers curled over the watch.</p><p>"Toki is not a person that holds any power in this court," she continued, eyes low. "Toki alone could never have discovered the truth, nor brought the guilty to justice. But Sagi is the Daimyo. Sagi has the freedom. I believed that."</p><p>I took a second to wrap my head around that. That was a mind-trip. Her brother, her <em> twin</em> had been murdered, and every second since she had lived in his place, pretended to be him. Every second had to be a reminder that he was dead.</p><p>I couldn't even imagine…</p><p>What if Shikamaru <em> died</em> ? I'd been twinless Before. But that was different. I'd been a different person then. This life, this lifetime, was so woven around him. He was everywhere, in every memory I had, part of every skill and talent. They all linked back to him, inextricable.</p><p>If he died… there would be so many empty holes in my world. Empty places, the shape of a brother. His absence would be as noticeable as his presence.</p><p>I tried, for a second to imagine that. Then I tried to imagine myself filling those holes with myself, to convince everyone else that he was not dead.</p><p>My skin <em> crawled.</em></p><p>"It didn't work," I said. She wouldn't have needed to go to these lengths, to dress up and run around at night, if she'd been able to go through legal methods.</p><p>"No," Toki said, admitting defeat. "Sagi has less power than I thought. Mousou controls the court now and Komei the militia. I played the part of the cursed warrior, instead, in hopes of discovering who was behind the assassinations. It is an old legend in this palace, that only a ghost can gain true vengeance."</p><p>"We'll help you," Naruto declared boldly.</p><p>"That is not our mission objective," Sai said mildly, almost sounding like he was saying it just for forms sake. It was the first time he had spoken since we had found Toki, and that was being quiet, even for him.</p><p>"Sure it is," Naruto replied. "Our mission was to stop the ghost, so if we find out who is behind the assassinations, then all the ghost sightings will stop."</p><p>I considered that to be a fairly sound argument, really. More so than some of the things we'd done.</p><p>"Have there been more assassination attempts since?" I asked. "Against you?"</p><p>Toki shrugged, carelessly. "Some. But none have led back to the culprit. I have fought them, and I have chased them, and nothing has been accomplished."</p><p>I reassessed how well I thought she was dealing. That was a very deep well of apathy, right there. An astonishing disregard for her own life. Even if she did gain vengeance and discover the truth, what did she have then?</p><p>"Maybe one of us should stay with you," Naruto suggested, giving me a slightly wide eyed look. "So that you don't get hurt."</p><p>"The only reason I continue this shameful existence," Toki said. "Is so that I can get my revenge. Once that is done, I can perish for all it matters."</p><p>"Hey! Don't say things like that," Naruto cut her off. "There are heaps of reasons that you shouldn't die. What about your friends? This country? You're supposed to be the Daimyo, right? Living only for revenge is no life at all."</p><p>"You have no idea what it feels like to lose everything you hold dear," Toki spat at him, suddenly. "You have no <em> idea-</em> "</p><p><em> I do,</em> I thought, and didn't say. <em> Every person, every place, every story and song and-</em></p><p>But that wasn't something I could share with her, to ease her pain, to show sympathy. It just left me feeling old and tired.</p><p>"You're right!" Naruto shouted back, interrupting the gathering pity party. "I don't know! But I do know that you shouldn't just give up because of it."</p><p>I shushed him, and swept my senses out to make sure that no one had heard and was coming. Alone, we might have been, but I didn't think people were truly that far away. And if there had been assassination attempts, then the guards would be on alert for noises coming from the Daimyo's rooms.</p><p>Naruto shook his head, as if shaking the argument itself off. "Shikako, you stay here with her tonight, okay? Me and Sai will go back and find Chishima."</p><p>I nodded. I wasn't exactly thrilled to be on body guard duty and not be investigating things, but better me than Sai. Whatever his secret mission from Danzo was, leaving him alone with a Daimyo was asking for trouble. "Stick together, okay? And be careful what you say to Mousou –"</p><p>"You cannot tell him," Toki interrupted, eyes fierce. "If the identity of the Cursed Warrior is revealed, then I will never be able to discover the truth." Her hand went to her side, where the sword of the Warrior would have hung, as if she were prepared to offer an ultimatum at swordpoint.</p><p>"I get it," Naruto said impatiently. "They'll try even harder to kill you if they know you know. And that's not going to happen. We're going to protect you <em> and</em> find out the truth!"</p><p>Whether she wanted it or not.</p><p>I covered an amused smile.</p><p>"Do as you will," Toki said. "As long as you do not interfere with my search."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Guard duty was a tedious experience.</p><p>I found a comfortable spot to sit in Toki's room, where I could have my back against a wall and see both the window and door. And waited.</p><p>It was like meditating, in a way. A certain serene watchfulness, where thoughts faded into a quiet hush. It was as though the brain was a computer going to standby, to screensaver, everything there but still.</p><p>I waited as Toki slept and stirred and tried to sleep again.</p><p>Eventually she gave up, sitting so the covers pooled around her lap. She reached out and grabbed the pocket watch sitting on the bedside table, rolling it in her palms. In the darkness, lit only by the light of the moon from the window, she was a blur of outlines.</p><p>"Are you awake?" she asked, hushed and quiet.</p><p>"Yes," I replied, equally so. There was always something intimate about conversations in the darkness. Something that made it easier to talk.</p><p>"Sagi and I used to share a room," she said, still so soft. "We didn't have to, of course. But we did."</p><p>I breathed out, slowly. "I have a twin brother," I said, as though it were a confession. "We did the same."</p><p>"It's empty, without him," she whispered. "I don't know how to be one person, instead of one half of two."</p><p>"What was he like?" I asked.</p><p>She shifted. "Kind," she said eventually, and it sounded broken. "Kinder than me. He was good at making friends. With everyone, even the scribes and apprentices. He hated going to training with Komei. I used to convince him to let me go instead. No one could ever tell us apa- apart." She choked, and there were soft, breathy sounds of sobbing. She muffled them into her hand.</p><p>I shifted, uneasily, and wondered if I should go closer. Should comfort her.</p><p>"This watch," she continued eventually. "He gave it to me. As he. When he died." She swallowed, seeming to fight off another bout of tears. "It has been handed down for generations of Daimyo. From father to son. But no longer. The chain has been broken. The watch stopped ticking the moment that my father was killed. As if it too felt the pain of death. It is as broken as my heart – we are both stopped forever in the past."</p><p>She fell silent, sounding exhausted. Little wonder, if she was.</p><p>"Daimyo to Daimyo," I said, so so softly. "It doesn't sound like the chain has been broken at all."</p><p><em> Cold comfort</em> , I thought. Watches could be fixed. Hearts were so much harder.</p><p>I listened to her cry and felt the ache in my chest. I wanted to say something. I wished I could make it better.</p><p>Even hearts healed, eventually. But that didn't make it any easier to bear when they were wounded.</p><p>"My brother and I have been fighting," I said quietly, leaning my head back against the wall. I was no less alert but… it felt easier. To not look at her. It felt like I was offering something up, cracking myself open to trade pain for pain. "As ninja, we're not really safe. I got hurt. It was- it was pretty bad. I was so scared."</p><p>I breathed in, ragged, startled at myself for saying it. For admitting it. It had been weeks, and I was only just starting to be able to consider it, without gently skirting the edges of my own thoughts.</p><p>"It scared him too. He wanted me to quit, to stay at home, where I would be safe. But I couldn't. I can't. This is what I'm for." I didn't know how much of this she was understanding. How much she could even hear. Maybe I wasn't even saying this for her. "I hate fighting with him. But I can't even imagine what I would do if he were gone."</p><p>"Revenge," she said, voice cracked. It sounded like a pact. Like we were swearing it, together. "You would get revenge."</p><p>"It won't bring him back," I said, the truth plain. I couldn't tell her she was wrong.</p><p>"No," she agreed, hand clenching around the watch that didn't tick. "But that's not the point of it."</p><p>Dawn came slowly, a creeping of light into the comforting darkness. Toki dressed in heavy, masculine finery and donned the mantle of her brother. If I hadn't known the truth, I probably wouldn't have guessed just from looking at her.</p><p>I trailed after her all morning, and though I received a few questioning looks, neither Toki nor I explained, and no one asked. She spent the morning embroiled in court politics, and was tireless in her arguments.</p><p>Even now, even spending nights hunting murderers, even planning to die once it was done… even now she was fighting tooth and claw for her country. Fighting to take part in discussion, to be the Daimyo she should have been.</p><p>It was a good sign. <em> You haven't lost everything, Toki. Not everything.</em></p><p>I had hope for her. I just had to make her see it.</p><p>At lunch time, she decreed that we would eat at the lake. That was apparently more complicated than just packing a picnic basket and going, because there was an entourage of guards and courtiers and servants bustling about to escort her.</p><p>I bore with it.</p><p>And then three ninja jumped out of the lake to try and assassinate her.</p><p>I sensed them coming, chakra in a place that chakra shouldn't have been, and wasn't surprised when they leapt out of the water. I slid in front of her and deflected the shuriken – strange, triangular designs – and let them close into Shadow Possession range.</p><p>They landed on the shore, feet squelching in the mud, and my shadow slithered into theirs.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," I intoned.</p><p>Face to face, none of them looked remarkable. In fact, they looked carefully unremarkable. Blue formless outfits over mesh under-armour, with cloth masks that covered all but their eyes.</p><p>The eyes widened.</p><p>"Who are you?" I asked.</p><p>There was a flicker of chakra. A familiar flicker. Something I had set myself more than a thousand times.</p><p>An exploding tag.</p><p>My hands raced through seals, even as I caught sight of the first, terrible spark of fire. "<em> Earth Release; Earth-Style Wall!"</em></p><p>It wouldn't be in time.</p><p>I had to be in time!</p><p>The explosion rocked the wall even as it grew, shattering it into shrapnel. I was pelted with it and the heat blast of the explosion - tinged with the smell of burning flesh - seared my face.</p><p><em> That was. Sudden.</em> I thought numbly, as the smoke faded away. There was no chakra left. <em> Why did he.</em></p><p>I hadn't been going to kill them. Arrest them, maybe. But …</p><p>That didn't call for a suicide attack. This hadn't been that kind of fight. Had it? They hadn't even fought back, not really. There had been no escalation. No build up. No exchange of techniques or attempts or conversation. Nothing. They had just. Blown themselves up.</p><p><em> Dammit all. What was the point of that?</em></p><p>"Sagi-sama!" One of the guards cried out, in between coughing. "Are you injured?!"</p><p>"I am unharmed," Toki said. I glanced at her over my shoulder; she was giving every appearance of being completely unruffled. Good. The blast hadn't harmed her. "The attackers?"</p><p>"Dead," I confirmed, as the dust cleared and all I could see were… remains. Gingerly, I went forward. There were little enough of them left. Too little to gain any decent information from, without an experienced pathologist. Fire had a way of erasing evidence really well. What wasn't charred black was melted.</p><p>There would be no recognising who these men were.</p><p>I sighed, and ran a hand through my hair, rattling the dirt out of it. I picked up the strange shuriken, weighing them thoughtfully in my hand. They were unique, different to the standard Konoha model, but that didn't mean I knew where they were from.</p><p>The lake was wide enough that they could have entered it at any location, even swum up the river if they were skilled enough. It would be hard for the palace guards to have stopped them.</p><p>But.</p><p>This picnic had been a spur of the moment thing.</p><p>"Do you come here a lot?" I asked, mind racing. "To the lake?"</p><p>Toki blinked at me. "Occasionally," she said. "We would often play here as children. It is a place to remember."</p><p>But not so frequently now that it was a habit. Interesting. So, either they had chanced upon us, had been waiting here for some time, or… they had known we were coming. Either by following us, or by being informed. It had not been particularly secret, but at the same time, there had not been much time for the news to spread.</p><p><em> More questions. No answers.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>We hadn't exactly set a time to meet up again, but I expected Naruto and Sai to come and find us in the evening. I couldn't exactly go and find them, since that would mean leaving Toki alone.</p><p>I almost regretted that we hadn't put a Naruto clone on Toki-duty but since there had, actually, been an assassination attempt, I didn't continue too far down that line of thought.</p><p>"Sorry we took so long," Naruto stage whispered as they snuck in through the shogi doors to the courtyard, having come in over the roof. "This investigating thing is really hard."</p><p>I smiled at him. "What have you found out?"</p><p>"The times, locations and causes of death of the Daimyo and 'princess'," Sai answered, smoothly. "The main suspects all have alibis. There have been three more attempted assassinations of the new Daimyo. They have alibies during those times too."</p><p>"Four assassination attempts," I said calmly, gesturing to the shuriken that I'd stacked on the table. "Three ninja attempted to ambush us at lunch time."</p><p>Sai frowned imperceptibly. "Ninja?" he repeated. But he also didn't seem surprised. I filed that thought away.</p><p>Naruto bent over the table and grabbed one of the weapons. The neatly stacked tower of them clattered over and scuffed the table. He rubbed the mark sheepishly with his sleeve. "These look like the ones we saw in the armoury, right Sai? Chishima took us around on a tour," he explained to me. "He said some of the guards used them but not many."</p><p>I sighed. "So they used local weapons." They could have just stolen them from the armoury. That would have been the easiest solution. It was a dead end.</p><p>"But they were ninja?" Naruto asked. "Really ninja?"</p><p>I nodded, biting my lip in thought. "I didn't see a headband and I didn't exactly ask for their ID cards," I said wryly. "But they had chakra and it was trained. And they had exploding tags."</p><p>"Can we interrogate them?" Sai asked.</p><p>"They had exploding tags," I repeated.</p><p>Sai didn't ask anything further about the matter.</p><p>"So you have found nothing," Toki said, wearily. "Another day, and I am no closer to the truth."</p><p>"Hey," Naruto protested. "We've only been here a day! There's heaps more stuff we have to do before we give up." He sounded stung, like solving this in a day wasn't an expectation too high to have.</p><p>She pushed herself to her feet. "I will continue my own investigations! These wasted hours weigh heavily on my heart."</p><p>She stalked off in a flurry, shedding the heavy robes of office and returning in a simple cotton outfit to wear beneath the heavy Cursed Warrior armour.</p><p>I yawned, propping my elbows on my thighs and letting my chin rest in my hands. After a full night keeping watch and a day of body guarding, I was tired. But it didn't look like rest would be coming any time soon.</p><p>At least this wasn't the constant rush-fight-rush of some of our missions.</p><p>"We don't all have to go," Naruto said suddenly.</p><p>I blinked at him. "Well, no. As long as one of us is with her. Did you want to split up again?"</p><p>"We could cover more ground," Sai agreed.</p><p>Naruto nodded, linking his hands behind his head. "We should watch Toki in shifts, like we do night watch. So I'll go now, and Sai can watch her tomorrow. That way you can get some rest."</p><p>That was directed at me. I raised an eyebrow. "I'm not that tired. I can keep going," I said. He did have a point, and I wasn't objecting the idea. I just didn't need it done solely for my sake.</p><p>He grinned. "I know. But you don't have to yet, so you should get some sleep."</p><p>This conversation felt oddly familiar, a strange echo of what we had told Sai at the start of the mission. In that vein, I could hardly argue with it, could I?</p><p>Sleep deprivation hardly contributed well to keeping a clear mind. I'd be a fool not to sleep when I could, especially if this turned out to be a long mission. We had no idea how long it would take to solve this.</p><p>"Yes, taicho," I said teasingly.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I woke to darkness, not quite sure what had startled me awake, but knowing it was a threat.</p><p>Beside me, Sai also jerked awake. We hadn't set a night watch for the two of us, but neither of us were heavy sleepers. The trade-off had seemed worth it.</p><p>"Status?" Sai breathed quietly. He hadn't moved.</p><p>There was nothing in the room with us. Nothing I could see or hear or sense. Further out… I stretched my senses, straining to find whatever it was that had awoken me.</p><p>There was chakra there, stronger and more defined that that of the palace guards.</p><p>"Ninja," I breathed back, sliding out of the futon. I slipped my shoes on, grabbed my kunai pouch and found my jacket. There was no question that I would follow them and find out what was going on.</p><p>Sai was ready to go in equal time – maybe even less. He followed me as we silently stole out of the room and slipped along the palace hallways. My only guide was the chakra<em> right</em> on the edge of my sensing range. I didn't want to lose it. It was moving directly away from us, towards the edge of the palace grounds.</p><p>Then I stopped. Because there was something coming towards us, something small and scuttling that had only the barest traces of chakra clinging to it. Sai's chakra.</p><p>He knelt to retrieve the ink mouse.</p><p>I hadn't known he'd made those. Now I had another thing to worry about.</p><p>"There are more ninja congregating in a room in the west wing," he said, without preamble. "A full squad, if not more."</p><p><em> Great.</em> I weighed up how much I trusted Sai, over the urgency of the mission. Squads of ninja meant nothing good. I'd already taken out three. There was another ahead of us. How many were there?</p><p>"See if you can find out what they're after," I said, deciding. I hoped I wasn't wrong. "Try not to engage. I'll follow this one."</p><p>We broke apart, soundlessly going our own ways. I pulled my chakra in, as small and tight as it would go, as unnoticeable as possible, and made my steps as utterly soundless as I could. I was little more than a ghost in the night.</p><p>I followed, cautious but confident, all the way out of the palace and into the forest. They were heading close to the shrine, which made me a little nervous. Did they know? Were they after Toki? Was this another assassination attempt?</p><p>I touched down cautiously on the ground in the shrine courtyard, intent on sneaking the last few meters to avoid notice, and the chakra –</p><p>- vanished.</p><p><em> Damn.</em> I flung myself sideways, rolling across the ground and coming up kneeling, kunai in hands and facing my original spot.</p><p>Nothing happened. The wind blew through the tree leaves. The stars twinkled overhead, moon beaming down brightly, giving enough light to see by. Enough light to tell that the courtyard was completely empty.</p><p>I refused to relax my guard. <em> A trap. I walked straight into it. </em></p><p>I was on high alert but I couldn't sense anything. Nothing. Not a single person in my range.</p><p>I channelled chakra to my ears, hoping I could hear something. Breathing. Anything.</p><p>"Did you think I didn't notice you following me?" A heavy, male voice asked. Behind me. Too close. Too loud.</p><p>I spun around, rising, kunai whistling through empty air. Nothing.</p><p><em> Calm down.</em> I told myself sternly. <em> Don't get yourself worked up.</em> <em> Think it through. You know there is someone here, you just have to find them.</em></p><p>I could see nothing. Sense nothing. Hear only what he let me hear. He might as well have not been there.</p><p>I breathed in and out, slowly, trying to calm the rapid hammering of my heart. My palms were sweaty around the handle of my kunai. It wasn't productive.</p><p>My eyes darted across the ground. It was too dark to tell if he was leaving footprints.</p><p><em> I can fix that,</em> I thought, trading one of my kunai for my lightsaber. It was a pity my legendary weapon was so frequently useful as a torch. The glow of it lit up the night, stripping away any chance I might have had of hiding – but they knew I was here, anyway. To my disappointment, the light it threw revealed no shadows of hidden people.</p><p>"That's a neat jutsu you have," I said, conversationally. My voice didn't even waver. "Camouflage Technique, right? You must be good to be able to cover your chakra with it."</p><p>The people we'd encountered before – Kajika's people – couldn't. They hadn't been able to move and keep it going either. I had a sinking feeling that might not be the case here.</p><p>I held the lightsaber out to the side. It had the effect of making my shadow stretch in the opposite direction, right to the walls. I could circle it around from there, running unobtrusively around and enclose the courtyard. It picked up nothing.</p><p>I hoped that meant he wasn't in the shadows, rather than his technique protected him from it. I could have tried to stretch it further – to cover the entire ground in shadow and find him no matter where he was hiding – but I didn't think I would manage it. Stretching a shadow to increase its length was one thing; area was another.</p><p>"You stuck your nose into something that's none of your business," he said.</p><p>I swung the lightsaber, lightning dancing off the blade in a wide arc towards the source. It fizzled harmlessly into the ground, the words not betraying the true location of the man. He was throwing his voice, keeping me from finding his true location.</p><p>"It's our mission," I said, trying to keep the conversation going. <em> Engage him. Stall him. Play for time.</em></p><p>"And you'll die for it," he spat. "Hidden Leaf scum."</p><p>The ground grasped at my ankles, suddenly, with no spike of chakra warning. I yelped, caught off guard, chakra going immediately to my feet to free me. Even as I struggled, it pulled me deeper and I knew I had bare seconds before I was underground.</p><p>"Touch blast!" I pressed it down with my foot, using a conical shape that would drive the force of the blast away from me.</p><p>But it was still setting off an explosion in an enclosed space and it wasn't pretty. The stone shattered, yes, but I was lifted up and catapulted backwards from the force of it. I rolled across the dirt, scrambling to rip my shoes off. The soles were <em> melting</em> from the heat of it.</p><p>I hissed in pain.</p><p>I'd lost my jutsu. My shadows were gone. My lightning blade shut off. My nightvision was ruined and I could see nothing.</p><p>But there was no time to stop. I had to keep moving. I pushed off the ground, narrowly missing being struck by a kunai.</p><p>The angle of it –</p><p>I followed it back, activating and launching another sweep attack from the lightsaber. Again, nothing.</p><p><em> Earth jutsu; is he even above ground?</em> I cursed not being able to sense him. I cursed being so reliant on the fact that I usually could. The kunai suggested he was, but kunai launchers were so easy to rig.</p><p><em> I need something bigger</em> , I thought. Radiating Shockwave was the only area of effect lightning jutsu I knew but dammit, I had the Sword of the Thunder God. That had to mean something.</p><p>I stabbed it downwards, deep into the earth. It cut the rock easily, but that was only where the blade could reach. "<em> Lightning Release; Sword in the Stone</em> !" I howled, all but throwing chakra into it.</p><p>Lightning blasted out, a full carpet of it, lighting up the courtyard from beneath; the force of it was focused downwards into the ground, but spikes of electricity danced up into the air in a parody of reversal. I wove chakra into my legs and feet, protecting as much as I could, but it still hurt where they lashed at me.</p><p>A shape, hard as rock, hurled itself out of the ground at me.</p><p>I dodged, but barely, clipped by an arm that threw me to the ground. I tumbled, jutsu fading.</p><p>But it had served its purpose.</p><p>"You'll die for that," he growled out, voice like rocks grinding together. I had been half right with my earlier assumption of that he was using camouflage jutsu. He was using it to blend in with the rocks and stone, and to remove himself from my senses. Even now he was grey and marbled, and I had a feeling that if I lost him again, it would be much harder to find him a second time.</p><p>I panted, breath coming in sharp gasps. "Thought that was your plan from the start," I managed. "I could have sworn you'd already said that."</p><p>I really needed to learn how to say more helpful things.</p><p>"Rock Tank," he growled, and spun forward. His body became circular, rolling like Chouji's Human Bullet Tank. The moving sphere picked up mass like an avalanche, growing larger and leaving a giant trail of destruction in its wake.</p><p>I moved again, springing off the rock and ignoring the way pain stung through my feet. I was cushioning them with chakra as much as I could, but it wasn't enough.</p><p>The seals I planted in the dirt went off as soon as he passed over them. I was pelted with rock shrapnel, and threw and arm across my eyes to protect them.</p><p>That was the reason I didn't see him coming at all, as he slammed me into the wall, hand locked around my throat. My head rattled against the stone, red spiking through my vision.</p><p>I froze, muscles locking up.</p><p>The world buzzed red and black. Red and black.</p><p><em> In the world of Tsukiyomi, time and space are mine to command…</em></p><p><em> Some strange whimpering sound escaped my mouth, but it didn't seem real. Nothing seemed real. I was pinned and I was floating away and I was both at the same time.</em></p><p><em> I – </em></p><p><em> -</em> pulled free.</p><p>I was the shadow pooling around our feet. Everything that touched me fell under my sway. I reached, stretching up and up, blackened limbs looping around and around. My arms elongated, black hands clawing at a neck, pressure and more pressure. Stone skin refused to give way, the attempt at strangulation useless. I reached up further, splitting another hand to cover nose and mouth. Suffocation was also sufficient for my purposes.</p><p><em> (- slumped against the wall, hard stone pressed against my back. There was no escape. I was caught. I was helpless. I couldn't, I couldn't do this again. I couldn't. Please. No.)</em></p><p>The enemy heaved and twitched in my grasp. The body, lost in fear, twitched in his.</p><p>I needed to make him release it.</p><p>I changed tacks, shifting form from solid shadow to shadow possession. His limbs moved under my power, hand unclenching and drawing backwards. The body slumped against the wall, making small, distressed sounds.</p><p>I stepped him backwards. And again, until there was sufficient distance between them.</p><p>(<em> Hands drew back from my neck and I choked, gasping for air as my lungs burnt. I burnt. My back slid against the wall, skin scraping raw against stone. I couldn't stop the sounds escaping my mouth. I was </em> afraid<em> . I didn't want to be here. I didn't want to be doing this. </em> Please. I want to go home<em> .)</em></p><p>"Who," he asked. "Who's there?" His eyes were wide and rolling, trying to see behind him, or to the sides.</p><p>"That depends," I said, voice made only of air changing shape. "Who are you?"</p><p>If he would talk, I would not kill him. Our mission was to acquire information. He could still be useful.</p><p>"We are the Watari Clan; the Wandering Ninja," he said, something indefinable in his voice.</p><p>I had heard of them. There were not that many large groups of shinobi that did not belong to a village left any longer. Fewer still that didn't have land of their own and maintained the nomadic lifestyle of the pre-village era, moving to wherever there was work.</p><p>"The Land of Birds has not hired you," I said, confident in the fact. Because if they had, then they would not have hired us.</p><p>He snorted. "You know nothing. What it means to be nomadic, forever travelling with no place to call your own… that's something that a pampered village brat like you would never understand."</p><p>I could hardly deny that. But he was warming up to the topic, speaking more freely, and I hoped I could glean something useful from his ranting.</p><p><em> (I huddled against the wall, arms drawing over knees. I wanted to run but there was nowhere to go. There was nowhere to go. Nowhere was safe. I could never escape this life. All I could do was stay small and quiet and hope that no one noticed me.)</em></p><p>"What would you know of endless drifting? Of sharpening skills without benefit of a school or teacher? Of having limitations that can't be surpassed, and of always being looked down upon by those like <em> you</em> ."</p><p>"How terrible," I said, blandly. "That doesn't explain why you're here."</p><p>Had someone hired them to assassinate the royal family? If so, who? Who would have had the knowledge, in this cloistered, superstitious place? Was it even someone within the country at all?</p><p>"That," said a different voice. "Is not your concern."</p><p>And I realised I had made a terrible mistake.</p><p>The enemy had been stalling as much as I was. He had been waiting for backup. And it had arrived in the form of a blue haired swordsman, slinking out of the night and holding a blade to the body.</p><p><em> (He was holding a sword to my throat. I have to do </em> something<em> , I thought, but it was a dim and distant thought that belonged to someone else. My reflexes were choked with panic and terror. I would die here, die for nothing, with nothing.)</em></p><p>I threw myself across the courtyard, a streak of black on the ground, rising up between the two and batting the sword to the side. He repelled the two shadow stitching tendrils I aimed at him, slicing one in half. It didn't hurt, exactly, it was not a physical limb to feel pain. But there was loss, because of it.</p><p>"Nagare," the swordsman said, retreating a fraction as I drove more tendrils at him. "I wondered what was keeping you."</p><p>I hovered, uneasily, on the ground in front of the body. This was not good. And worse yet, I could feel the strain of the jutsu trying to pull us back together.</p><p>The enemy – Nagare – grunted. "I got caught off guard."</p><p>I swirled backwards, gathered around body's feet, ready to move her to safety and –</p><p>(<em> The dark shadow, my jutsu, defended me, launching attacks that drove him off. It came to me and</em> -)</p><p>- We were one.</p><p>I staggered to my feet, woozily, uncertain. Nothing really felt real. But it didn't feel so unreal either. I was in two minds, but I wasn't. I was myself again, except I had always been only myself.</p><p>A hysterical laugh bubbled past my lips.</p><p><em> Maybe the clan was right. This is really screwed up.</em></p><p>But I had two enemies in front of me that needed dealing with. Breakdowns could wait till after. They had to wait till after.</p><p>"Careful, Hokushin," Nagare said. "She's stronger than she looks."</p><p>Considering I must have looked pretty damn awful, that wasn't really saying much.</p><p>I coughed. "We don't have to fight," I rasped. "If you aren't trying to attack the Daimyo, then I have no problem with you." It might have been a better argument if we hadn't already been fighting. But. I made do with what I had.</p><p>"Funny," Hokushin said, levelling his sword in my direction. "That's exactly what we're trying to do."</p><p>That was more information than Nagare had given me. But it was not good. It meant that I couldn't afford to let them go, either. Not if they were just going to attack Toki.</p><p>I had to deal with them here and now.</p><p>Right. Two enemies. Both good at concealing chakra. One had a sword. I didn't want to engage him close range, obviously. The other, an earth jutsu user. Taijutsu would be useless, but he was weak to lightning. He had distance attacks, however, and I couldn't discount that.</p><p>I reached for my sword.</p><p>And it wasn't there.</p><p>Luck wasn't on my side today, clearly. I couldn't even remember when I'd dropped it. When Nagare had attacked me? When I'd been split?</p><p>I didn't waste the energy cursing it.</p><p>Nagare raced through a set of handseals, slapping his palms down on the concrete. The ground under my feet went mutable, rising to grab me.</p><p>I <em> moved.</em> I couldn't risk getting caught in that trap again. Not after the damage I'd done to myself trying to escape it the first time.</p><p>I speed boosted, dropping my resistance seal and amping my chakra enhancements to the max. The strain of it felt like a deep burn in my muscles, already trembling from the abuse I'd put them through.</p><p>It wouldn't last me long, then.</p><p>I grimaced. <em> Time to abandon subtlety.</em></p><p>I took a second's break, though, perched sideways on the courtyard wall, to gather myself, before launching at them.</p><p>Nagare was ready for me, blocking my first attack with a simple arm bar. It was hard as rock. I didn't even try force it, using it instead to push myself up, planting a hand on his shoulder and flipping right over him. My fingertips left ink behind.</p><p>I hit the ground and rolled, ducking beneath Hokushin's sword swing, digging a hand into my kunai pouch and planting an experimental magnetic seal on the ground. They'd worked well enough during sparring, even if they weren't particularly refined.</p><p>Then I performed an extremely fast replacement jutsu with a hunk of rock on the other side of the courtyard and narrowly escaped being crushed to pieces.</p><p><em> Activate!</em> I used a half seal to focus, and set both seals off at once.</p><p>Hokushin stumbled as his sword dragged towards the ground, metal caught in the magnetic fields created by a piece of paper.</p><p>Nagare. Well. Nagare exploded into a shower of rock.</p><p>I was far enough away to escape the debris. His ally was not. He was clipped across the face and went tumbling across the ground, sprawled lax and awkwardly.</p><p>I wasn't sure if he was dead. But he wasn't moving. I waited for a long second, almost sure he was faking. But nothing happened.</p><p><em> Two birds with one stone, right?</em></p><p>I smothered a set of inappropriate giggles. This was not the time.</p><p>I pushed myself to my feet and limped towards him, still alert for ambush. If he wasn't dead, then I wanted to be sure he stayed out of it.</p><p>"Rock," a voice said, just as I reached him. "Blizzard."</p><p>I hit the ground. It wasn't quite enough to save me from the stones that flew through the air in a parody of the explosion I'd forced on them. They whistled through the air above me, a couple clipping me before I evaded, and began to form a person.</p><p><em> You have got to be kidding me. What does it take to put this guy down?</em></p><p>I had had people brush off explosions before. Kidomaru. Kimimaro. But to put himself back together <em> after</em> I'd blown him up? That was something different.</p><p>And worrying. That was bodily physical transformation, like Konan and her paper form. That was an A-rank level technique of serious utility.</p><p>How do you take out an enemy that you can't damage? Or rather, that damaging doesn't <em> stop?</em></p><p>I didn't have time to consider it, pushing myself off the ground with speed that belied my injuries. The ground quaked and cracked beneath me.</p><p>I tried to make for high ground, shooting for the walls to try and get to the trees. If I could get to the trees –</p><p>Spikes shot out of the wall. I ground to a halt, bare feet skidding painfully over the ground and doing nothing good for them. But I managed to avoid taking a spike to the face, so it was probably worth it.</p><p><em> Keep moving.</em></p><p>He had me blocked in. I couldn't get out, and there was nowhere in the courtyard that was safe to pause. I had to keep moving – keep moving in an unpredictable pattern – and it was wearing me down. I couldn't keep it up.</p><p>I couldn't even tell if the constant ninjutsu was equally wearing on him. I couldn't count on it.</p><p>This was a battle of stamina and I was losing.</p><p><em> Think,</em> I told myself. <em> You have options.</em></p><p>Did I? I couldn't run. I had tried to fight. I couldn't outlast him. I had to, somehow, get rid of him.</p><p>Get rid of him.</p><p>A crazy, stupid idea bloomed in my mind.</p><p>I grabbed it with both hands.</p><p><em> This had better work</em> .</p><p>I yanked a blank scroll out of my jacket and bit my thumb for blood. No time for ink. The seal itself wouldn't be tricky. It was a simple one, one of the first I had learnt. It was just… adjusted, a little bit.</p><p>The attacks slowed a fraction. Either he was curious or cautious. I didn't care which; I took huge advantage of the fact.</p><p>I launched myself across the ground towards him, scroll held ready in my hand. This was going to be the tricky bit, and I mentally spared a quick thanks to Tenten for teaching me how to throw them. That was an art in its own right. Paper was not aerodynamic.</p><p>It arched around, flying through a full circle, enclosing him and returning to my hand.</p><p>Nagare responded by sinking into the ground. If I let him, he'd be out of my trap before I could put it to use.</p><p>"Seal!" I said grimly, feeding it chakra. There was a huge puff of chakra smoke. The seal was not efficient, but it did its job. Air rushed past me, whooshing in to fill a void.</p><p>Everything within the loop of the scroll had vanished.</p><p>There was a gaping pit in the ground, a perfect circle going down and down. I didn't even know how deep it was – it looked endless. It wouldn't be. Even though I hadn't put a terminating distance on the effect, the sealing matrix got weaker and weaker the further from the anchor that it was. Eventually it would simply have faded out and ceased to affect the world.</p><p>I shivered. My hands clutched at the sealing scroll that held a person. He wouldn't have survived that, no matter the jutsu he was using. Sealing scrolls were not for living matter.</p><p>I used my bleeding thumb to line an edge of red around the top. It wasn't quite the black of a body scroll. But people would still know.</p><p>Then I very carefully limped away to retrieve my lost weapons.</p><p>There was nothing more to be done here.</p><p><hr /></p><p>So even when I tell myself that everything is going to fit into one chapter, it doesn't. I shouldn't even be surprised by this anymore. .</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Birds Arc: Chapter 86</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>ImpressedAnon – I always wish I could reply to reviews like this. I'll try keep it short. The bounties? Probably declared and taxed as a secondary income, I suppose. It wasn't much money. Hopefully Shikako doesn't seem <em> too</em> blasé about it all – I have tried to keep her very aware of what it is she's doing, even if she still does it. Com clones – the team expected to have more time / fewer enemies and didn't think they'd be necessary. Mostly just not thought of. XD The mission was vetted, and it seemed simple and not noteworthy, as you pointed out, Chishima was on the level and there was no indication that ninja were around. <em> Italised</em> thoughts are just a way for me to not right 'I thought' every sentence, while having them separate from the overall narrative. There's no distinct voice behind them. Lastly, yes, Anko is involved. Probably. Maybe not. It's likely. How did you know about Cadet Stimpy?</p><p>In honour of Terry Pratchett and Leonard Nimoy.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 86</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> It is not by muscle, speed, or physical dexterity that great things are achieved, but by reflection, force of character, and judgment ~ Marcus Tullius Cicero</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>My feet were blistered.</p><p>That was second degree burns, at least. I hissed as I tipped my canteen of water over them, trying to wash off the worst of the dirt. It was a little too late for the 'run under cold water' treatment to do much good, and I didn't have that much water anyway.</p><p>Well, it wasn't like I'd never had burns before. Admittedly, these were the worst – I'd never tried to set off a tag I was holding before. Because I could recognise that as a dumb move, even if it had been the only option I had at that point.</p><p>There were also lightning burns marking up my shins, little feathery fernlike patterns. Lightning flowers, they were called, caused by the rupturing of capillaries under the skin. These were probably no more serious than a bruise.</p><p>But it did highlight one fact.</p><p>Despite how the fight had gone, most of my injuries had been the result of my own actions. Nagare had managed to land very few hits. I'd have bruises, for sure, but they wouldn't have slowed me down nearly so much.</p><p>I was getting careless, and it was becoming a problem.</p><p>More than a problem – I'd unintentionally torn myself in two with an untested, experimental jutsu that I'd been heavily advised against developing. This time, it hadn't even been a neat and even split like it had the first time I'd used it. It had been rougher, lopsided, and had left me physically defenceless in the middle of a fight.</p><p>I hadn't meant to use it. I'd just… panicked. I'd been trying to get away.</p><p>I shuddered and gently coaxed my burns into healing with medical chakra, then slathered them with burn cream before wrapping them heavily in bandages. It would have to do.</p><p>I rubbed my throat, chasing the phantom touch of a hand wrapped around it. My palms were sweaty. I was trembling, faintly. It had never been this bad before. A feeling of Deja vu once or twice. A lurching feeling in the pit of my stomach. Nightmares. A momentary faze when faced with Sharingan. Nothing like this.</p><p>"I'm okay," I told myself, out loud. The words didn't have some magical ability to fix everything. I didn't feel any better. "It's okay."</p><p>It wasn't, though. And the worst thing was I didn't know how to fix it, because I had done the best I could.</p><p>I limped towards the shrine tunnel, subdued.</p><p>Toki was going to have to overhaul this whole tunnel thing after this. Secret evacuation tunnels worked best when they were actually, yknow, secret. Otherwise they were just a direct line into the heart of the palace. And while I would have said that neither Naruto or I would abuse that knowledge, Sai also knew. And if Sai knew, Danzo would know.</p><p><em> More problems.</em></p><p>Wearily, I crawled out from the trap door, sliding out under the table and giving Naruto what was apparently the fright of his life. Well, at least they were back. I'd wondered if they were still out investigating.</p><p>"What happened?! You're hurt!" Naruto hovered, darting forward, then back again as he changed his mind. "Do you need me to get stuff? A first aid kit?"</p><p>"I'm fine," I said. "I've got one."</p><p>"But what happened?!" Naruto burst out. "Did someone attack you?"</p><p>There was a rustling sound in the other room, and Toki appeared in her night clothes. One hand rested out of sight behind the door, and I was sure she was holding a weapon.</p><p>"Another attack?" she asked, eyes flicking over me. I felt twice as dirty and dishevelled because of it.</p><p>"Something like that," I said.</p><p>"Where's Sai?" Naruto followed up. "Was he hurt too?"</p><p>I shook my head. "No, I don't know; we split up. He went to listen in on some kind of meeting."</p><p>"A meeting?" Toki echoed. "This late at night?"</p><p>"We were a little suspicious as well," I agreed. "It's definitely ninja, though. The two I fought were from the Watari Clan – they're a bunch of wandering ninja that don't belong to a village. Not missing ninja, they just never had one in the first place. I bet the three assassins earlier were also from there. Whoever hired them hasn't skimped on the numbers."</p><p>"So there's probably more," Naruto finished. He lifted his chin and knocked his fists together. "So we'll just beat them all up!"</p><p>"Right, right," I agreed almost absently. I didn't bother pointing out that the conspiracy likely went deeper than we'd expected, if someone was able to hire and hide a whole lot of ninja for the several weeks, if not months, that it had been since the Daimyo died.</p><p>Sure, ninja were sneaky. But we were talking at least a dozen people. That had to leave some kind of imprint.</p><p>"I didn't get much information out of them," I said. "Hopefully Sai knows more."</p><p>"I'll send a clone to go and find him," Naruto said. "In case he runs into trouble too." His face was creased with worry.</p><p>I gave Toki as much of a reassuring smile as I could. "You should go back to sleep. Tomorrow might be busy."</p><p>Her hand closed around her pocket watch. "Good."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Sai snuck into the room.</p><p>He was good at that, in a way that betrayed training and experience. I tried to think of it as a helpful trait, not as something to be wary of.</p><p>"Taicho," he said, dropping one knee to the ground. "I have information."</p><p>"What is it?" Naruto asked. "What was the meeting about?"</p><p>"There was a squad of ninja receiving orders from their employer," Sai said, calmly.</p><p>"Who is it?" Toki demanded. "Who is behind all of this? Tell me."</p><p>Sai was still looking at Naruto, not her. He didn't continue until Naruto nodded impatiently. "Their employer is the same man who hired us. Mousou."</p><p>I hissed through my teeth. It had always been a possibility, but not one I had taken <em> that</em> seriously. I hadn't even met the man.</p><p>Naruto looked shocked. And betrayed. "Oh, no!"</p><p>Toki's face closed down, becoming cold. "Mousou. So it was you, all along," she murmured.</p><p>"I was unable to confirm the identity of the ninja, or the village they were from," Sai said.</p><p>"They're from the Watari Clan," I said. "I ran into two of them, earlier."</p><p>Sai's eyes flickered over me. I knew he couldn't have missed my injuries, but he had given no indication that he'd noticed them, either. "I see," he said. "They were identifiable?"</p><p>"Nagare and Hokushin," I offered, on the off chance that the names meant something to him.</p><p>He might have recognised them. He might not. But he pulled out a Konoha issue bingo book and after a few moments, managed to open it to display the faces of the men I had fought. The Watari Clan had a two page spread in general, with several more pages following for the stronger shinobi in their ranks.</p><p>I was surprised he had a bingo book, though I shouldn't have been. Of course he did. Even Naruto might have been issued one when he was promoted, though I'd never asked.</p><p>"That's them," I confirmed, though the pictures were seriously out of date. Looking at their bingo book stats made me feel twice as lucky to have won - I'd already known that I shouldn't have really stood a chance, but this just confirmed it. "Who else do they have listed?"</p><p>More information was better, if we were going to run into more of them.</p><p>"There's one more thing," Sai said, surrendering the bingo book to me. "Komei has been arrested. Guards confiscated a suit of armour identical to that of the Cursed Warrior from his quarters."</p><p>"But he's got nothing to do with it!" Naruto protested.</p><p>"It's a set up," I confirmed. "He's being framed." It was a cunning plan, if you considered it. Komei was Mousou's main opposition in gaining control over the country. This way he got to disgrace him <em> and</em> stop the rumours about the ghost of the Daimyo. It wouldn't actually solve the problem of the ghost – but how many people could see Toki, how many times could she go out without getting caught? It was a fairly neat solution to what had to be a last-minute complication; no one could have <em> expected</em> someone to seek vengeance as a ghost.</p><p>"He is going to be executed at dawn."</p><p>I nearly dropped the book. "What?"</p><p>"He is being provided with an opportunity to commit seppuku and end his life in an honourable fashion," Sai said. "Though I imagine someone will assist him if he decides not to."</p><p>"There's no time to lose. We'll go there right now!" Naruto declared.</p><p>"That is something we cannot do," Toki said, just shy of sounding regretful. Like she had judged the outcomes and knew that she could live with it. Or not live with it, as the case may have been. "It would mean revealing to Mousou that we know truth. I wouldn't get my revenge."</p><p>"You're saying you'd sacrifice an innocent guy for the sake of your stupid revenge?" Naruto exclaimed, voice rising higher and louder. He sounded both disbelieving and totally appalled. "You're the Daimyo! You're responsible for all your people!"</p><p>"I have no choice!" Toki responded. "Besides, he'll be guarded by a legion of soldiers. We would never be able to save him with anything less than starting a civil war."</p><p>I winced. That would be bad. That was pretty much the opposite of what we were going for here.</p><p>Naruto's chin edged out in a sullen, defiant way. "Not if we do it," he said. "Do you have a problem with <em> that</em> ?"</p><p>"Okay," I said in the tense silence that followed. "Do we have a plan?"</p><p>"We can be the ghost," Naruto said. "Then everyone will know that Komei didn't do it."</p><p>It was a workable plan. We'd be able to get Komei out, at least. Then we just had to reveal Mousou for the mastermind behind it all in some way that was incontrovertible.</p><p>I drummed my fingers against my leg.</p><p>Well. We already had a ghost in play. It would be all very Hamlet.</p><p>"Okay," I said slowly. I didn't want to jump into another fight so soon. But Naruto was here. I wouldn't be alone. "I think that this could work."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The plan went wrong even before it started.</p><p>Of course it did.</p><p>It wasn't even <em> that</em> complicated a plan. Toki and I would take our places at the dais, because she was the Daimyo and I had been sort of acting as her bodyguard. Sai would tail Komei to ensure he made it safely to the execution grounds. And then Naruto would swoop in as the Cursed Warrior, reveal himself to be the murdered Daimyo through careful transformation, proclaim he had been murdered and try to get some kind of reaction or confession. Toki would then join in, condemn Mousou and get her vaunted revenge.</p><p>That was the plan.</p><p>It went wrong the second that Mousou entered to sit on the dais, and I saw him for the first time.</p><p>And felt the chakra humming from him. The chakra of an active technique. It wasn't much. Maybe about the same amount as an academy technique, and done with efficiency and precision besides. If he hadn't been so close to me, I might not have notice. His chakra signal felt natural enough that I wouldn't have looked twice at it – but now that I second guessed it, it felt distinctly compressed, for a civilian.</p><p>As casually as I could, I draped my braid over my shoulder and ducked my chin. Perched on the silver clasp at the end of my hair was a tiny Naruto clone spider. I'd wished I thought to tell him to make it into some other creature, but they were small and handy and that trumped my instinctive dislike of eight legged things.</p><p>"Mousou," I breathed to it, the barest of sounds. "Is a shinobi."</p><p>It didn't disappear, but it did, sort of, <em> wave</em> legs at me. I hoped that meant the message was received.</p><p>Then I sat back and watched Mousou as well as I could without staring. That changed things. If he <em> was</em> a shinobi and hadn't just hired them… was he Watari Clan as well? Was the whole clan here? That would be ridiculous and really bad.</p><p>Toki was in much more trouble than we'd thought.</p><p>A set of guards lead Komei into the yard. He was dressed in a white kimono – the formal attire of the rite of seppuku – with his hands bound. He also did not look entirely unharmed.</p><p>He waited, still and watchful, as he was led to kneel on a mall bamboo mat. It was positioned in front of Mousou, not Toki, which said large amounts about the power structure here. I wasn't sure Toki had even been invited, it was just that no one could turn us away after we had showed up.</p><p>Casually, Mousou opened a scroll passed to him by one of his attendants – also ninja, unless I missed my guess. "A verdict has been reached," he said. "Betraying your position as chief tactician to the late Daimyo, Owashi-sama, you conspired to his assassination as well as the murder of his daughter, Toki-sama. Furthermore, you and your subordinates were responsible for manufacturing the apparition known as the Cursed Warrior; your purpose being to spread panic among our people, undermine the authority of Sagi-sama and usurp his role as Daimyo of the Land of Birds. You are a traitor. You are commanded to take your own life!"</p><p>There was muttering from the crowd that had started to gather. This event had not been publically announced, but people had been drawn here anyway, through a grapevine of gossip. We had been counting on that, initially, as witnesses but now they were people we'd have to keep safe.</p><p>There were a lot of them. I swallowed, nervously.</p><p>Komei gave a short, bitter chuckle. "So that's it, Mousou," he said. "I see it all now. You've sprung your trap, haven't you?"</p><p>"If you're a warrior, Komei," Mousou said, eyes narrowing. "Then die like one."</p><p>One of the guards lifted a sword, clearly the kaishakunin - the second - that would perform the beheading. Komei lifted the unmarked tanto lying on the mat.</p><p>I shifted. <em> Where was Naruto?</em></p><p>I didn't want to see this. I didn't want to let it happen.</p><p>Then, fog started rising from the ground. It was thick and eerie, billowing up around our knees, and completely saturated with Naruto's chakra.</p><p>He was going to continue with the plan then.</p><p>"Yooouuu," Naruto moaned in a credible imitation of a ghost, appearing suddenly in the middle of the yard with a replacement jutsu. We didn't know what the old Daimyo had sounded like, so the ghostly voice would have to do.</p><p>And while all eyes were on him, I felt the spike of chakra and switch that suggested Komei had been replaced with a clone as well.</p><p>Good. That was one thing down.</p><p>"My trusted advisors," Naruto continued, drawing all the words out. "Betrayed me."</p><p>I could <em> see</em> Mousou taking stock of the situation and trying to work out how to turn it to his advantage. "What trick is this, Komei? This will not stay your execution!"</p><p>Naruto reached up to unlatch the helmet, revealing an excellent transformation into the last Daimyo, copied straight from the portrait in Toki's rooms.</p><p>Mousou may have known that he was facing ninja. So he probably knew that it was only a transformation. But the whole thing was a performance, for the crowd, more than it was about him.</p><p>He backed up a step, then caught himself. "Owashi-sama," he said smoothly. "As you can see, we have apprehended the man responsible. You can rest in peace."</p><p>"He is not the one," Naruto said, though it sounded slightly less ominous and slightly more ridiculous. I hoped he didn't ham it too much. "I am here for my vengeance! I name you, Mousou, as the one responsible for my death! You are not what you seem!"</p><p>Mousou cursed, low and vicious. "Men! This ghost is an imposter trying to sow deceit! Arrest him!"</p><p>Toki lunged to her feet, interrupting him. "Is this true, Mousou?! Did you assassinate my father, so that you could become the regent of this country? You, of all people, have gained the most from his death!"</p><p>"You trust the words of a ghost?" Mousou protested. "They are nothing more than filthy lies!"</p><p>"Strike! And see the truth!" Naruto commanded, throwing the Cursed Warrior's halberd to Toki.</p><p>She caught it easily, spinning it in her hand and lunging at Mousou. It was well done, and skilful, but as slow as a civilian. "Guards! To me!"</p><p>Mousou blocked it, with his bare hand. "Now, Sagi. This is not the time to be over reacting."</p><p>Then, the small stun tag on the metal tip of the halberd went off. I'd given Naruto a bundle of them, earlier, but the placement of it had been his own choice. And it was a good one – the electric shock might not have hurt Mousou all that much, but it shattered the fragile chakra shell of his transformation, leaving behind a very different person.</p><p>Mousou – no. Hoki. I recognised him as the leader of the Watari Clan, from Sai's bingo book – cursed.</p><p>He ripped the polearm out of Toki's hands, lunging forward faster than the eye could follow.</p><p>Then froze.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," I said, still kneeling where I had been sitting all along. Toki had dragged my shadow with her as she lunged, and from there it had been easy to snare him.</p><p>The guards hovered, nervously torn between orders. The complete change of Mousou's person probably wasn't helping them.</p><p>The ninja, on the other hand, leapt into action. Naruto created a score of clones to occupy them, and Sai's ink beasts burst into the scene to help subdue them. I raced my shadow out, helping to hold who I could, and hoping that no one was going to try suicide bombing again.</p><p>"Who <em> are</em> you?" Toki demanded, staring. "You aren't Mousou at all!"</p><p>"I am Hoki," he said, lips twisting. Clearly he understood that there was no way back from this. "The leader of the Watari Clan. Mousou was just the lie that your father fell for!"</p><p>"Right from the start…" Toki said, eyes going wide. "You've been plotting to take over since the moment you arrived here."</p><p>"How dare you judge us, you spoilt feudal brat!" Hoki spat. "Fortune has always favoured you. You know nothing about our lives. We suffer in ways you could never understand."</p><p>"So?" Naruto demanded, ditching the transformation with a puff of chakra smoke. "You had it tough, big deal. So do lots of people. That doesn't make it okay for you to come here and kill people!"</p><p>"And what would a village brat like you know?" Hoki said scornfully. "Pampered ninja from a wealthy village couldn't begin to understand. Those that have homes and families and the support of clans… how can you compare to our wandering, vagrant lifestyle?"</p><p>Of the ninja on our team, the only one that fit those criteria was me. There were shadows in Naruto's eyes at the accusation.</p><p>"All we wanted was a place to call our own," Hoki said, voice turning syrupy and cajoling. "There's nothing wrong with that, surely?"</p><p>"So find someplace else," Naruto said bluntly, completely unimpressed with the attempt to sway him. "Don't try and take someone else's home. That's not right! You could have found somewhere new! You could have <em> asked!</em> "</p><p>"You speak as if we never tried that!" Hoki shouted. "As if we didn't build from scratch only to have the ninja villages destroy it from under us! As if your precious <em> Hidden Leaf</em> hasn't hounded us for years. This way we have the power to fight back! We would be in control. We would never be forced out to wander again!"</p><p>I wondered if the accusation had truth to it. Konoha did not have a history free from morally reprehensible actions. And that was without even considering what happened in the shadows.</p><p>Toki slapped him. I winced as my head was rocked to the side, the force carried through my jutsu. "That doesn't give you the <em> right</em> ," she hissed. "You killed them!"</p><p>He sneered back, blood dripping from his lip. "That's what ninja do. Ask your little friends. How many of my men have they killed in the last two days alone? You think they're any better than us?"</p><p><em> Five. The answer is five,</em> I didn't say. Did he think I didn't know that?</p><p>"They attacked us first!" Naruto retorted. "If they hadn't done that then they wouldn't have been hurt. You can't blame us for your actions." He crossed his arms. "Stop trying to make everyone else feel bad. It doesn't make what you did any less wrong."</p><p>"Hurry it up," I suggested tightly, feeling the strain developing on my jutsu. There was a limit to how long I could hold it for. Generally speaking, we didn't have conversations like this.</p><p>Toki drew back and took a ragged breath. "Hoki, formerly known as Mousou!" She declared, half to him and half to the slightly confused audience. "I pronounce you a traitor to the crown. I have found you responsible for the assassination of Owashi, Daimyo of the Land of Birds. And," she reached up to remove her hat, and let her hair spill down her back. "Of Sagi, Daimyo of the Land of Birds! Twice over you have killed our lord! I, Toki, sentence you to death!"</p><p>There were a number of startled exclamations from the crowd.</p><p>"Toki," Naruto said. It wasn't quite a protest, more of a reminder, but I thought he didn't exactly approve of that last bit. Killing people in battle was different, in a way. You didn't have time to consider it. It wasn't so <em> deliberate. </em> As if that made it better.</p><p>Toki grabbed a sword from one of the guards.</p><p>We could have stopped her. Of course we could have. All I would have needed to do would be to let go.</p><p>And what then? Would Hoki go quietly? I didn't think so. And keeping ninja imprisoned took a lot of skill and caution. It would almost inevitably fail. A second attack wouldn't be so subtle – and we wouldn't be here to stop it. We could try take him back to Konoha, try to transport him and however many other ninja were here by ourselves. And really. Would that be any better future for them?</p><p>So we could have stopped her. But we didn't.</p><p>"Hoki-sama," one of the Watari-nin gasped, sounding stricken. "You'll pay for that."</p><p>"<em> Enough!</em> " Naruto shouted. His hands were clenched into fists at his side. "Enough fighting! It isn't fixing anything! Revenge just goes around and around and everyone ends up dead! Why can't you try talking to each other?!"</p><p>There was chakra gusting out from him, kicking up wind, like it would have in the middle of a fight. Still blue, still only Naruto, but a sign he was really upset all the same.</p><p>Toki was breathing heavily, gaze upon the corpse. The sword in her hand was limp, dragging on the ground.</p><p>The tableau was frozen. The silence stretched out.</p><p>"He is dead," Toki said, wearily. "Owashi. Sagi. You can rest in peace now." She turned, slowly, to take in the sight of everyone else.</p><p>"The dead have their justice," I said, quietly. "What about the living? You're the Daimyo now, Toki. You need to make a decision."</p><p>Maybe I wasn't quiet enough. A cry of 'Toki-sama!' went up from the crowd, and people started collapsing to their knees. They were bowing to her, crowning her with the power she'd only held in her brother's name before.</p><p>Her eyes were wide. She swallowed, harshly, then stepped forward. "The dead have their justice!" she repeated, voice carrying clearly. "No more will Cursed Warriors haunt our lands – their time has passed! We must look to the future now; move forward with the hands of the clock." She turned towards the prisoners held captive in our grips. "For you who followed Hoki, the ninja of the Watari Clan, I tell you this. Your leader has died. And like a true warrior, with him die his crimes."</p><p>She stood straighter, looking calm and resolute. "If you are as you claim, and wish only to have a place to call home, then I give you a choice. Stay. Make this land your home and love it as we do. If you do not wish to stay here then leave and do not return."</p><p>"And don't even think about attacking," I added, as severely as I could. My shadow jutsu broke, and I unfolded my hands. They were stiff from being held in one seal for so long. I was glad that none of them had been fighting to break my hold at the end, it probably would have worked.</p><p>One ninja faltered, then knelt. And one by one the others began to make their choices. Some knelt. Some turned and fled. None were foolish enough to try their luck.</p><p>Cynically, I didn't think that it would last forever. Toki had – maybe – avoided making an enemy of the entire clan by accepting them, but she was almost certainly keeping enemies close.</p><p>"Toki-sama," a more familiar voice said, breaking from the crowd to also kneel near the front of the stage. "Forgive me," Chishima entreated.</p><p>"You could not have known of his betrayal," she said. "We were all fooled."</p><p>"Not only for that," Chishima explained. "Forgive me for not seeing how much pain you were in. For not noticing that you were not Sagi, all along. I should have seen it."</p><p>I felt a little like we were witnessing something private, but he had brought this up here and now. Everyone was witnessing it.</p><p>"I didn't wish for you to see it," Toki said finally. "You are forgiven. And I am sorry that as you learn it is I who stands here, you must realise that Sagi is long dead."</p><p>He bowed.</p><p>She turned away. "Bring me Komei. We have much to discuss about the future of this country."</p><p>Sai arrived quietly bringing Komei from wherever he had been evacuated to avoid the fighting.</p><p>"Why didn't you stop her?" Naruto hissed at me, as we followed Toki towards a meeting room.</p><p>It sounded like an accusation. I hated it. It immediately put me on the defensive and I hated that too.</p><p>"Why didn't you?" I hissed back, like an attack. "It was the best thing to do."</p><p>Naruto looked actually surprised. "How can you say that? I didn't think you'd think like that."</p><p>"Why not," I responded. "He was the enemy. He tried to kill us. He wouldn't have just gone away."</p><p>"You let Gaara go," Naruto said. "And Temujin. And that was the same."</p><p>"No it wasn't," I said. "It's not even remotely the same." It was different, with Gaara, because I had known. Temujin had been Gaara's choice. I wasn't sure it had been the right one, but I could justify it.</p><p>I huffed, impatiently. "Gaara and Temujin were totally beaten. We had the upper hand, do you understand? Even if they came back and attacked again, we would have won again. Konoha was too strong for the invasion; Temujin's soldiers couldn't stand up to ninja. But Land of Birds doesn't have that strength. You think he wouldn't have waited until we left and then killed Toki afterwards?"</p><p>"It's still not right," Naruto said. He looked troubled.</p><p>"Then find a better answer," I snapped. "Because I don't know what it is."</p><p>I tried to reign in my temper, because I didn't want to be mad at Naruto. Not when he was right. Maybe I was mad because he was right, and that meant we had been wrong. And I didn't like that.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We kept taking watch with Toki. I'd rather insisted on it, even though she and Komei had spent the entire day hammering out what to do with the remaining Watari-nin – and what to do if the rest attacked.</p><p>I'd even volunteered for first watch. We'd switched to shifts rather than full nights, and there was a tiny Naruto spider snoozing somewhere in the end of my braid. I tried not to fidget and squish it, though I really wanted to.</p><p>"They want to have a crowning ceremony tomorrow," Toki said, sighing. "Apparently, having been Sagi doesn't count."</p><p>"It might help ease the confusion," I suggested. "The situation <em> is</em> complicated."</p><p>"I know." She held up the pocket watch so that I could see it. "When they called me the Daimyo… I heard it tick." There were tears welling in her eyes. "From Daimyo to Daimyo. Time moves on."</p><p><em> What kind of jutsu does that?</em> I wanted to know but that wasn't the important question to ask.</p><p>"It does," I agreed. "Do you know what you're going to do now?"</p><p>"I had no plans," she admitted. "I thought that I would join my ghosts. But there is so much to be done here. If someone kills me, then someone else will try and gain revenge for it. It will be a never ending circle."</p><p>I nodded. In that way, killing Hoki probably hadn't helped. "It's a hard one to break. You know, you're going to need someone to guard you, right? For a long time; until you can be certain of their loyalty. They might mean it when they say this is their home now, but it only takes one."</p><p>"You won't stay, will you?" She asked, already seeming to know the answer. "The three of you."</p><p>I quirked a smile, and risked drawing my knees to my chest. "To tell you the truth, we're not really trained for this. We're making it up as we go along."</p><p>Toki laughed, and it sounded real. "The secret is… so am I."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Naruto sent a toad to Konoha in the morning. Apparently Jiraiya had a system where they could get there pretty fast, so Toki's mission could be accepted with ninja dispatched in a day's time.</p><p>But before that, we still got to sit through the second Daimyo's coronation that we'd been invited to. That we'd been the cause of. There was probably something wrong with that.</p><p>I'd even been gifted with a formal kimono that had apparently belonged to Toki when she was younger, mostly because I'd made a vague comment about finding a place to buy replacement shoes, and that had apparently led to a whole new outfit. Or something.</p><p>Granted, it was better than being dirty and dishevelled at a very formal event, but I was a little afraid of moving in fear that I would wrinkle it.</p><p>During the ceremony, the Watari Clan made their formal statement of commitment towards the Daimyo. There were more of them than there had been before – apparently not <em> all</em> of them had been involved after all – including women and children. There was a woman with a particular shade of blue hair that caught my eye.</p><p>"Sorry," I said to Naruto after the ceremony. "There's someone I have to speak to."</p><p>I didn't want to. And it wouldn't fix anything. But I had to do it all the same.</p><p>I approached her awkwardly, and not only because of the kimono. "I'm Shikako Nara," I said quietly, folding myself into seiza across from her. "One of the Konoha ninja."</p><p>"Hokuto," she said in turn, eyes guarded. "Of the Watari."</p><p>"Hokushin." I faltered. "Was he your…" In some ways, I didn't want to know the answer to that. Easier, if he was just an enemy. If he didn't leave anyone behind. But the world didn't work like that.</p><p>She was silent. "He was my brother."</p><p>I reached into the neck of the kimono and withdrew two scrolls. It hadn't felt right, leaving them behind with my gear.</p><p>"I'm sorry," I murmured, setting them respectfully on the ground. I didn't make any excuses. Either she would understand, or she wouldn't, and nothing I would say could change that.</p><p>She reached out and picked them up. Her hands were trembling. "Leave," she said.</p><p>I left.</p><p>We stayed vigilant, but two days later when Raido Namiashi arrived we were able to report that there were no further incidences. I wasn't sure whether he seemed very impressed or very <em> un</em> impressed, but it did seem like we were leaving Toki in capable hands, either way.</p><p>We said our goodbyes, and started a quiet and subdued journey home. It wasn't that our mission had ended badly. But it hadn't been quite so clean cut, either.</p><p>"Did you want to take first watch?" I offered to Sai, after he checked our perimeter for the third time.</p><p>He came back and sat down. "No," he said. "There is something I want to tell you."</p><p><hr /></p><p>There is also now a DOS community, to contain anything related to this story.

			<h2>Land of Birds Arc: Chapter 87</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 87</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> There's a battle outside and it is ragin'</p><p>It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls</p><p>For the times they are a-changin' </em></p><p><em> ~ Bob Dylan; The Times They Are A-Changin'</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Eh, what do you want to talk about? Is it about the mission?" Naruto prompted, puzzled. He seemed more confused than worried, which was fair enough because the mission was, to all accounts, over. It had already been dealt with. We'd even handed it over to someone else.</p><p>We shouldn't have been running into any new problems just yet.</p><p>Of course, that never really worked out very well for our team, anyway.</p><p>I was a little warier about whatever Sai was going to bring up. I knew what I <em> wanted</em> him to say but it was probably a bit too much to hope for. We'd only been on two missions together, and there hadn't really been anything pushing for the truth.</p><p>Sai looked as nervous as Sai could look, which wasn't very. "About the Watari ninja," he corrected. "It's likely that we will face censure for our decision to allow them to ally with the Land of Birds. That ninja was not wrong when he said that Konoha has long been preventing them from settling down in one place in the fear that they will grow strong enough to be a danger."</p><p>He took in our puzzled faces and forged onwards. "My secondary mission was to prevent the Land of Birds from establishing ninja forces."</p><p>Something unpleasant jolted through me. I hadn't forgotten that Sai had been up to something, but it had taken on a much lesser priority.</p><p>"What?" Naruto asked, again. "What do you mean 'secondary mission'? Did Baa-chan tell you to do that?"</p><p>He crossed his arms, frowning at Sai. He looked a little hurt, which was fair enough if Tsunade was going around giving missions to his team mates behind his back.</p><p>"No," Sai said, and smiled. "She did not."</p><p>That didn't sink into Naruto with as much gravity as it should have, but I understood it. What he was skirting the edge of saying.</p><p><em> Sai. </em> Was he really telling us now? So early and easily? We hadn't done anything to convince him, or earn it. Even the way we'd been trying to make him focus on emotions had sort of been shelved for this mission. There just hadn't been time<em> .</em></p><p>"What's <em> that</em> supposed to mean? Sai? What did you do?" Naruto said in frustration, voice rising in volume and pitch. He uncrossed his arms and planted them on his hips. He was still more confused than angry.</p><p>"I didn't do anything," Sai said. "That's why I'm telling you. I was supposed to, but I failed my mission."</p><p>Oh. That was it. He was looking for reassurance. <em> Tell me I did the right thing.</em></p><p>I swallowed, and reached out so that my hand curled around his. While deciding what was the right course of action ahead of time was hard, I was an expert at coming up with reasons to justify it <em> after.</em></p><p>"You made the right decision," I said firmly, trying to transfer the idea just by sounding confident in it. "The Land of Birds is our ally. They have a strong trade agreement with the Land of Fire and have mostly avoided being caught up in the fighting between ninja villages. And they're only a minor country, besides. They don't have the resources to maintain and supply a village that could be an effective threat to us."</p><p>Okay, that one wasn't exactly true. Sound and Rain were both villages in minor nations, but they had the benefit of S-rank shinobi bolstering their fighting prowess. Without those, they wouldn't have been nearly as dangerous.</p><p>"It's much better to have the Watari settled somewhere where they have no reason to turn on us, rather than to keep them on the run. Eventually, if we kept pushing them, they would decide that retaliation was a better strategy than evasion – which is exactly what we're trying to avoid, right?"</p><p>They were good, sound, logical reasons; things that might comfort Sai, or that he might be able to use to argue his position. I guessed I could see why Danzo would want to have kept them moving, to prevent them from settling down and gaining power and becoming a threat rather than an annoyance. But that didn't mean he was right, or that it was a good tactic. If you pushed them too far, hounded them too much, then they wouldn't care that Konoha outclassed them. They would just throw everything they had at us, just to be left alone.</p><p>The cornered animal was the dangerous one.</p><p>"I failed my mission," Sai repeated quietly.</p><p>"You made a judgement call," I countered. "That's what they train us to do. To operate in the field where we don't have the direct supervision of our superiors, based on the information available to us."</p><p>"Yeah, it's okay," Naruto said. "No one's going to be mad or anything. You aren't in trouble." There was a silence. "Right?"</p><p>Sai gave him a fake smile. "It's nothing to worry about."</p><p>"No, I don't understand what's going on here," Naruto said. He looked from Sai to me. "About secret missions, or, or any of that! But we did the right thing and you shouldn't get in trouble for that! And I'll tell anyone who says otherwise!"</p><p>I had a brief, horrifying image of Naruto striding up to Danzo and doing just that. Sai's fingers flexed against my own, briefly, and I was sure he shared it.</p><p>"Thank you," Sai said. "But it's not necessary. I only wanted to tell you that I might not get another mission with you."</p><p>My eyes jerked to his face. I hoped he was talking about being reassigned. He looked so calm and composed that I couldn't tell.</p><p>"Like hell," Naruto declared. "You're our team mate. And that's that. Baa-chan will say you have to stay with us, and then whoever is giving you dumb missions will have to listen. She's the Hokage!"</p><p>I hoped it would be as easy as that. I expected it wouldn't be.</p><p>"Can you tell us who <em> did</em> give you the mission?" I asked, wondering if it was worth it to push it. We were walking a fine line here, all three of us. It <em> was</em> important, but I already knew. And I wasn't, entirely, sure what Naruto would do if he knew. At this point, there was very little we could actually change, especially for Sai.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>"Why not?" Naruto asked. "<em> Are</em> you an Anbu? Is that why…"</p><p>Sai blinked, and actually looked startled for a second. "Something like that," he said. It wasn't a yes. But it wasn't a no, either. And to be fair, ROOT both was and was not.</p><p>Naruto did look slightly appeased by that answer. "It's a secret, I get it."</p><p>"Yes," Sai echoed. "A secret."</p><p>I bit my lip, then took a chance. "You don't <em> want</em> to tell us," I said slowly. "Or you <em> can't</em> tell us?"</p><p>"I cannot tell you," Sai said. He hesitated again, then opened his mouth and pushed his tongue forward.</p><p>"A seal?" Naruto asked, voice suddenly hushed. The volume of earlier dropped away so fast it was startling. "What does it do?"</p><p>"Stops him from speaking," I said, stating the obvious. "Or at least speaking about something in particular."</p><p>"Can you fix it?" he asked.</p><p>"Remove it?" I said, guessing what he was really asking. "Probably not. Or … not yet. It's a compressed seal, I'd have to expand it to be able to understand how to undo it." I thought of the project I had barely started, trying to understand how to magnify a seal so that I could see the components. "It's a complicated one too. Part of the Eight Trigrams arrangement? No, it's a hexagram, that's even more…" I trailed off. It could have been 'Kan' or it could have been 'Ton'. Influence or concealment? Or both, layered over top of each other?</p><p>Sai closed his mouth. He didn't say anything else.</p><p>The silence stretched until it broke.</p><p>"Someone in Konoha put a seal on you, so you couldn't talk," Naruto said, voice flat like a he was pressing a lid down over simmering rage. "And they give you missions that Baa-chan doesn't know about. Missions that are <em> wrong.</em> "</p><p>I shifted, drawn back out of my thoughts, eyeing Naruto warily.</p><p>His hands were clenching and unclenching, muscles vibrating with tension.</p><p>"Did you know about this?" He asked me, still the same flat voice. His eyes were piercing blue. Still blue. Was this something I should be worrying about?</p><p>It was like the conversation with Sasuke all over again. I had the uncomfortable feeling that I was somehow <em> wrong</em> . It had sounded too accusatory.</p><p>"I had … suspicions," I said, trying to keep my voice as calm and neutral as I could. My heart was starting to hammer. I was a liar and I would keep lying to them. "But no proof."</p><p>"Does… does Baa-chan know about this?"</p><p>I gave a stiff, one shouldered shrug. I was as drawn tight as a bowstring. I'd snap, if I pulled any tighter. "I don't know," I said. "But. I don't think she could have missed it. Do you really think she would have assigned anyone a mission with you without doing a thorough background check? I think- She must have a plan. To find out how bad it is. Or how deep it goes."</p><p>Was this a good idea to be discussing in front of Sai? Was this a trap, a trick? But he gained so much less than he'd given, for this to be a trap. Would Danzo have judged it worth us knowing, in order for Sai to… to what? Get closer to Naruto? Sai had been doing that just fine on his own. This wouldn't help.</p><p>The thing was, our only advantage over Danzo was that he didn't even know we were playing the game. He was too settled, too powerful, had far too much experience here. If we played with fire, we would end up burned. And he was a whole lot of fire.</p><p>"It's not right<em> ,</em> " Naruto said, as though saying it would fix it. "It's like Neji's seal. It's not <em> right</em> ."</p><p>"It isn't," I agreed. "But there's not much we can do about it right now, is there? Look… I'll work on how to break it. It might take a while, that's all."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Naruto was… not exactly happy, all the way back to Konoha.</p><p>I doubted Sai was, either, and I was really not in any kind of mood to play peacemaker. I was tired and I was hurt and I was about a billion different kinds of stressed.</p><p>So I wasn't <em> thrilled</em> when the first thing that Naruto did was ask for another mission.</p><p>I could see why, though. If Sai really was in trouble, then turning right back around and leaving the village would delay it. Until we could think of something better or a way to help.</p><p>I got that.</p><p>But a back to back mission right now would have been … difficult.</p><p>"Not a chance, brat," Tsunade said gruffly. "Downtime exists for a reason and you are well and truly over the acceptable mission-load anyway."</p><p>"Besides," a second voice intruded, heralding Jiraiya entering the Hokage office behind us. Shizune trailed behind him apologetically. It was nice to see her again – I'd been vaguely aware that she had been on the front lines with dad.</p><p>"You won't have the time."</p><p>Oh<em> .</em> <em> Oh</em> .</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Surely not. They couldn't be leaving already.</p><p>We <em> needed</em> Naruto.</p><p>I glanced at Sai out of the corner of my eye. This was bad. If Sai had been assigned to watch Naruto, then Naruto leaving on his training trip would mean he would vanish back into the depths of ROOT. Even if you didn't factor in whatever punishment this mission promised for him, it was hugely unlikely that I'd get to work with him again.</p><p>He had just been shown light, and now it was all going to be snatched away from him.</p><p>"Why not?" Naruto demanded, spinning around.</p><p>"Why not, he asks," Jiraiya huffed. "You forget already, kid? I told you we'd be leaving after I finished looking into some things for Tsunade. And now I'm finished."</p><p>"Oh, but-" Naruto hesitated. He looked at me. At Sai. "I can't go. I… I have responsibilities. I'm a Chunin now."</p><p>Tsunade and Jiraiya exchanged mutely surprised looks.</p><p>"Nice to know you realise that," Tsunade said. "I'd been beginning to wonder if you thought the promotion was just about a fancy jacket. But I'm granting you special dispensation for this training trip. It'll be a good chance for you to get stronger, among other things. That <em> is</em> what you want, isn't it?"</p><p>She had him there.</p><p>"Yes," Naruto agreed, reluctantly. "But I could do that here," he argued weakly.</p><p>"Not safely," Jiraiya countered. "Not the things I want to teach you." He raised a meaningful eyebrow. "So go and say your goodbyes, we'll be leaving tomorrow."</p><p>It was like a punch in the gut. Like something I should have seen coming but got hit with anyway.</p><p>I <em> had</em> seen it coming. I'd <em> known.</em></p><p>But so soon…</p><p>"We'll have a farewell dinner for you," I offered, and if my voice was off no one said anything. "Tonight. At Hyakumi." That was a big Akimichi owned place that would probably not be too mad about a huge party coming in without much warning. "So that everyone can say goodbye. Uh. Hokage-sama. Jiraiya-sama. Shizune-san. If you wanted to come," I added, a little flustered. I knew them, and they were exactly the people that Naruto would <em> want</em> at his farewell dinner, but that didn't change the fact that I was currently inviting the leader of the village to a dinner party.</p><p>Awkward.</p><p>"Sounds like fun," Jiraiya said and patted me on the head. "You might want to stop at the Jounin Commanders office on your way out."</p><p>I was fairly sure I knew what that meant, but the surprise of it caught me somewhere between joy and panic. Dad had been gone for ages and a lot of things had happened in that time.</p><p>We were ushered out of the office and split up. Naruto heading home to pack and Sai to do… whatever. We managed to wrangle a promise out of him to show up for dinner, and I hoped it would hold.</p><p>I knocked on the door to the Jounin Commanders office.</p><p>"Welcome home."</p><p>He looked up from reading a scroll. I caught a faint flicker of recognisable handwriting – my own – before he rolled it and set it aside.</p><p>"Welcome home," he echoed. "You just got back?"</p><p>I nodded, leaning against the door frame. "Just now. Was going to head home and get cleaned up but Jiraiya-sama said you were here."</p><p>His gaze flickered over me. I had no doubt he could tell that I was tired and hurting. Guiltily, I hoped that would be enough to excuse me from any kind of in depth conversation right now.</p><p>"I was called back a few days ago," he said. "There's plenty of time for us to get caught up later. Go and get some rest."</p><p>I smiled. "Will do."</p><p><hr /></p><p>There wasn't actually much time for <em> rest</em> , but a shower and clean clothes went a long way to making me feel better.</p><p>I restocked, told mum and Shikamaru about dinner plans and bullied Shikamaru into actually going out and inviting the rest of his team.</p><p>Then I headed around to Sasuke's place, only to find that Naruto was already there.</p><p>"I heard you the first time, idiot," Sasuke was saying.</p><p>"Hey," I said, briefly knocking on the door. "Guess you've heard all about it already?"</p><p>Sasuke rolled his eyes. "And some," he agreed. "You heard about sensei yet?"</p><p>"No?" I said, with a tone of vague alarm. He didn't seem worked up, but that sentence didn't sound good. "What about sensei?"</p><p>"Hospital," Sasuke said. "Chakra exhaustion. We were going to go visit."</p><p><em> Not so bad.</em> Kakashi and chakra exhaustion went together like… stuff that was often together.</p><p>"I'll meet you there," I offered. "I have a few more things to do first. People to invite. Stuff."</p><p>Very smooth, Shikako. You're on a roll.</p><p>"Right," Sasuke said, dubiously, like he was weighing up whether it was worth asking more. "We'll see you there."</p><p>It wasn't like I had <em> much</em> to do, actually. And I did swing by and invite all the other Rookies and Team Gai to dinner. Everyone seemed to actually be in the village together, for once, which was a little surprising.</p><p>It was just that, after the debacle of forgetting my own birthday, I'd made of note of when my teams were. Sasuke's had already been and gone – while we'd been on a mission, no less, and he hadn't said anything – but Naruto's was <em> tomorrow.</em> He was leaving on his birthday.</p><p>So yeah. I wanted to get him a present.</p><p>In the end, I picked out a sturdy travel case – the kind for toiletries that had little compartments and sections for different things – because it was useful and he would be travelling a lot. Also, it was bright, screaming orange, so I felt like he would appreciate that.</p><p>Then I swung by Hyakumi to make a booking for dinner and ensure that we actually had somewhere to eat and had to politely choke down the onigiri that Tsubame Akimichi made me because 'you're too thin, dear'.</p><p>Chouji's family were fantastic people, they really were. They were kind and generous beyond all expectations. But I really did not eat as much as any of them seemed to assume I did.</p><p>By the time I got to the hospital, it was clear that Naruto had already repeated the story of our latest mission, judging by the semi-baffled look on sensei's face.</p><p>"Miso soup," I said, breezing in and handing sensei the takeaway cup I'd picked up along the way. "It's got eggplant in it."</p><p>I lifted the medical notes from the end of his bed.</p><p>"Pretty sure those aren't for you," Kakashi-sensei said mildly, popping the lid off the cup to check.</p><p>I shrugged. It was mostly blacked out anyway, but there was the 'chakra exhaustion' followed by a ramble of other codes that made little sense to me. No injuries listed, and no special care instructions as far as I could tell. "Just looking," I demurred. "You get into such trouble without us."</p><p>The expression he gave me was totally worth it.</p><p>I perched on the edge of the bed, because the chairs were all taken.</p><p>"And you get into no trouble at all," Kakashi said dryly. "What was this I heard about Watari nin?"</p><p>I shrugged, then had an idea. "Hey, how <em> do</em> you fight people using that Hiding with Camouflage Jutsu? Last time I could sense them, but this time they were better." I looked at him expectantly.</p><p>"What?" He said back.</p><p>"You're our sensei, you're <em> supposed</em> to be teaching us this." I wiggled my fingers at him. "So teach." Yeah, our team was being broken up. It had already been broken up, but this time, Naruto was actually leaving. There was no way to pretend that we <em> might</em> get another mission together. Not for three years, anyway. But that didn't mean that we had to all fall apart.</p><p>We were still a team. Kakashi was still our sensei.</p><p>"How did you fight them?" Sasuke asked suspiciously. "Naruto didn't say."</p><p>"Area of effect techniques," I said promptly. "I just blasted everything until I hit him. But that didn't work so great because I was <em> in</em> the area of effect. I want to know if there's a better way."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei put the still full cup down on the bedside table. "Right," he said, and cleared his throat. "Well. It depends on the circumstances and surroundings. But. You have a few options…"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Dinner was loud and rowdy. Sai had come, as promised, and Tsunade and Jiraiya. Word had got around, too, and it seemed like everyone who wanted to say goodbye to Naruto had shown up. Iruka. The Konohamaru Corps. Ebisu. Anko and Isaribi. An old Genin and some Jounin I didn't recognise.</p><p>He seemed torn between happiness and misery.</p><p>"Seems like the end of an era," Kiba said, jostling me with his shoulder. "Nothing's going to be the same now."</p><p>Akamaru scurried around under the table, not technically supposed to be here but somehow allowed anyway.</p><p>"You're too young to be talking like that," I shot back. "The end of an era. Tch."</p><p>He laughed, unoffended. "But it's true, isn't it? Damn, I never woulda thought that <em> Naruto</em> would be the first of us to leave."</p><p>I managed a laugh. "He's not going forever, Kiba. Three years, that's all."</p><p>"I know, I know. Feels like a lifetime, that's all. You know how much shit has happened in six months?" He shook his head. "I'll be surprised if he recognises us all when he comes back."</p><p>My stomach might have swooped. I would deny it, though. "We might have to invest in name tags."</p><p>"Good plan. Shino especially. Then people might remember him." He grinned, teasing.</p><p>Said person glared at him across the table and adjusted his glasses. "In that circumstance you should train to increase your observation skills. A skilled shinobi should not forget those around them."</p><p>"Don't fight," Hinata scolded gently. She wasn't being particularly obvious, but she'd been watching Naruto out of the corner of her eye all night, even though she hadn't spoken to him very much.</p><p>"Hey, Hinata, want to come with me? I have to give Naruto his birthday present." I would bet ten to one that Hinata also had something to give him, but hadn't quite worked up the nerve to actually give it to him.</p><p>A bet that was totally rewarded when she fished a neatly wrapped box out of her bag and stood to accompany me.</p><p>It was a good night. And early the next morning, I went out to the gates to wave goodbye as they left.</p><p>Sasuke was there too, and Kakashi-sensei leaning casually against a wall as though he'd picked this particular spot for no reason at all.</p><p>"Train hard, okay?" I said, hugging Naruto. "If you're going for so long then when you come back, you better be <em> at least</em> able to kick Sensei's ass."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei snorted.</p><p>"Believe it!" Naruto shouted at him.</p><p>"Yare, yare, keep it down kid," Jiraiya groused, looking bleary eyed. Since he'd been drinking with Tsunade the night before when we'd left the restaurant, I wasn't surprised. "And if we're giving out impossible challenges, then <em> you</em> better be able to fight me when we get back."</p><p>He dropped a hand on my head and ruffled my hair.</p><p>Beneath the surprise I was… pleased. I had exactly no chance in hell, but… it was a goal. Something to aim for. That was the level we needed to be on, anyway. This would just be an excuse as to why I was aiming so hard for it.</p><p>"Challenge accepted," I said winningly.</p><p>He laughed. "Whatever you say. Keep out of trouble, you hear me? And keep working on those seals. You've got some good ideas. I'd hate to see them go to waste."</p><p>They walked away.</p><p>That was it. That was all it took.</p><p>Naruto was leaving now.</p><p>At the gates, he paused, and turned around one last time. "Shikako?" he called. "I <em> am</em> going to find a better way. You better believe it!"</p><p><hr /></p><p>A.N: You can all blame Sai for this chapter taking so long. That conversation took forever. And Naruto is now gone, just like everyone wanted.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert.</p><p>ImpressedAnon: Answering as many as I can without this dragging out <em> too</em> much… Fire/Wind techniques – no ninjutsu, though she might be able to manage a fire one by copying Sasuke if really pushed. I assume Edo Tensei would just… fail? Since most of it's involved with dragging the soul back. And it's <em> probably</em> not powerful enough to rip out the soul, move it, then resurrect. Slightly terrifying idea to contemplate. Shadow Jutsu: It depends how she 'splits' as to what parts can do what, but yeah, it would be possible to use the stone. Moon watching is probably not a favourite hobby anymore, no. Not as bad as some other parts, especially when she's prepared for it, though. Childhood likely did involve a lot of shutting down and periods of non-communication. Which is still a thing she does now. The letters would be kind of hilarious, actually. Orochimaru paranoia – it's hard to know what he's up to when he's not actually acting. The kids are doing a lot more reacting than acting at this stage. I think Hidden Lightning only needed a very small push to start out and are using it as an excuse more than really believing it, and I wouldn't put <em> all</em> the blame on Shikako but…yes, Team 7's high profile missions have certainly not helped in this regard.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 88</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Turn your face to the sun and the shadows fall behind you. ~ Unknown</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>It was silly, but after Naruto left, I almost expected to blink and find that three years had gone by.</p><p>Which was… it was silly.</p><p>This was my life. It didn't work like that.</p><p>Just because Naruto wasn't here, didn't mean that there weren't things happening.</p><p>I went training with Sasuke and Kakashi-sensei because we were all there. Sensei wasn't exactly healed or participating, but he had a lot of advice to offer and I knew it was things we needed to work on. Sasuke and I had been practicing our blind fighting up to now, but that hadn't helped me much when I didn't have sensing to fall back on.</p><p>I think we were all conscious of the person missing, but we made do.</p><p>"We could get lunch?" I offered, when we were done.</p><p>Sasuke shook his head. "I've got gate duty."</p><p>"I had a meeting," Kakashi added, lazily.</p><p>I made no comment on his use of past tense or the implication that he was only going to go now. It didn't actually cause me any surprise.</p><p>So instead I picked up some takoyaki and went to knock on Sakura's door.</p><p>"Hi?" I said, holding the tray out in front of me as a peace offering.</p><p>"Hi," she said back, stepping out of the way to let me inside. She didn't seem upset, so that was something. On her end it had been nearly two weeks, but the last I had seen of her had been slightly strained.</p><p>"How did the thing with Tsunade go, in the end?" I asked.</p><p>Her eyes lit up. "She is so <em> amazing</em> ," she gushed.</p><p>I nodded, empathetically.</p><p>"I know, I know," Sakura waved it off. "But no, really. Tsunade-sama is amazing! I thought I was going to die. She wanted to know where I got the information from and stuff." She peeked at me from under her eyelashes.</p><p>"So you said me?" I confirmed.</p><p>She shrugged, unapologetically. "I couldn't lie, could I?"</p><p>Which, I supposed not. Tsunade hadn't said anything to me when we'd reported in, so that was something. Maybe she was just saving it up for later?</p><p>"She wasn't really that mad," Sakura went on. "More, I don't know, irritated? She said I shouldn't practice it without proper supervision anymore. And then she made me demonstrate it to her. And I think. Umm. I think…"</p><p>"You think?" I prompted.</p><p>"I think she wants to train me," Sakura said in a rush. She looked terribly pleased, and no wonder.</p><p>"Wow," I said. "Like, permanently?"</p><p>"I don't know," she said. "I don't think it's like it'll be like a sensei or anything. But still."</p><p>"It's Tsunade," I finished. And yeah, she was probably too busy to directly hands on teach a lot of stuff, but she'd managed to apprentice Sakura in the story, so she could probably make a bit of time here and there. And <em> any</em> teaching from her had to be worth its weight in gold.</p><p>"I, um," Sakura said a little more hesitantly. "I'm not supposed to share it with you. When I learn it. That was one of her conditions."</p><p>I nodded, a little disappointed but not particularly surprised. "Ninja don't really like sharing techniques all that much." It had dropped on my list of things to learn – yeah, it'd be nice to be able to punch stuff to death and there were no circumstances where being stronger was a bad thing – but straight out taijutsu wasn't exactly my focus and I was being pulled in so many different directions anyway.</p><p>And if Sakura learnt it… well. She might not be teaching me, but I had many, many more chances to see her use it than I did Tsunade. If they thought I couldn't work backwards from that, then Sakura hadn't been forth coming about how much information I'd given her in the first place.</p><p>"But you did!" Sakura burst out. "You gave it to me. The whole technique is your work. It should be you!"</p><p>I blinked, startled. "It's fine," I said awkwardly. "It suits you more than it does me anyway." I shrugged. "It's not a problem. Really."</p><p>It wasn't a big deal. Or… it was, and I could see why it was, but I didn't want it to be a big deal. It felt a little like payment for something she didn't know could have been an option. And she'd still made it, gone for the Medic Corps and impressed Tsunade, all on her own without me or Team 7 or any of it.</p><p>I cast around for something else to say. "Have you covered burns yet, in class?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>"You're never home," Shikamaru said.</p><p>It was a little too soft to be an accusation, but it felt like one anyway. The lazy relaxed attitude didn't cover the sharpness of his eyes.</p><p>"I'm busy," I said, as mildly as possible. "Missions, training… Maybe you've heard of them?"</p><p>I held up a bunch of scrolls as evidence.</p><p>The fact was – I hadn't been intending on going out again. But I'd been home for about half an hour before my mind had started buzzing with ideas. Things I had to do. Things to work on. There was the barrier seal, and chakra storage seal and the seal to view compressed seals that was suddenly much more important. And that lead to thinking about other seals I'd considered recently, and the magnetic one could probably use a bit of tweaking and, oh, that storage seal that I had brutalised in battle probably deserved to be recreated.</p><p>I'd been meaning to take a break (there was a pile of fiction sitting next to my bed that I hadn't touched since… since when? Graduation?) but with all that in my head, how could I just sit still?</p><p>"Rest, relaxation, family," Shikamaru shot back. "Maybe you've heard of them?"</p><p>"Can't say I have," I said. "I'll look them up later."</p><p>I slipped my feet into my shoes and was out the door before he could come up with another rejoinder. There had been nothing about the conversation that was aggressive or antagonistic, yet it still put me off balance. There was still that unspoken something between us that wasn't quite right.</p><p>I'd wanted to say something to him, when I'd been talking to Toki in the Land of Birds. But I could barely remember the feeling now. Or how to put it into words.</p><p><em> I get it; it would suck. I've seen what it does to people, losing a twin. </em></p><p>But I still couldn't stop. Because then we'd lose more.</p><p>Instead, I set it aside and picked a training ground to practice my sealing.</p><p>It was strange to be working with storage scrolls again. They were one of the first things I'd learnt, one of the easiest variations. Practically everyone knew how to make a storage scroll.</p><p>This one though… this one I had stripped of all the limiters and safety restrictions and basically everything that made ninja feel safe creating one then rolling it up and sticking it in their pockets.</p><p>It had done what I'd needed it to. And it had worked. And it was probably not a bad move to fall back on, if I really had to. But it was something I would have to be really careful with using, otherwise I might find myself minus a hand or two. Or it might destabilise and fail and rip a hole in reality.</p><p>Well. Probably not that one. I hoped.</p><p>It probably wasn't a great idea to leave holes of questionable depth in Konoha centric training fields, so I booked it out to the place that Kakashi had taken Sasuke, all those months ago during the Chunin Exams. It was a desolated rocky place, with plenty of giant stone pillars shooting up into the air, and somewhere where it was fairly safe to practice jutsu of destructive ability.</p><p>Go me.</p><p>And I was alone. Completely alone. Not another person within sight – or sensing distance. Probably a lot further than that, even. It made the world feel larger, wider, a little more echoing.</p><p>It felt a little like there was weight being lifted from my shoulders.</p><p>"Well then," I said to myself, bouncing a little. "Let's get to work."</p><p>The landscape didn't really stand a chance.</p><p>By the time I had some functioning prototypes that were mostly stable and reasonably unlikely to take my hands off when I used them, the place was littered with giant gouges in the ground and missing more than a few pillars.</p><p>It probably wasn't polite to leave huge holes in the ground, so I messed around with an amplification seal to try and use an earth jutsu to close them over – it was well out of the scale of things I could do on my own. My earth jutsu were rarely bigger than me.</p><p>That just led down a path of creating a functional seal to do it for me, though it was incredibly specific to the area and needed a specific breakdown of soil types in order to be able to do anything at all. Not exactly something I could pre-prepare and carry around, or make up on the fly.</p><p>But not bad, all the same.</p><p>It was dark by the time I got home, but there was still a light in the window.</p><p>"Tadaima," I said softly.</p><p>"Okaeri," Dad returned from the living room, where he was observing a half played game on the shoji board with almost absentminded thoroughness. "You missed dinner."</p><p>I shrugged, setting my shoes neatly aside. "I was training. Lost track of time."</p><p>"Leftovers are in the fridge." He said, turning his attention on me. It was the same look, the same lazy analysis; patient, like turning a problem over and over in your head before you had enough information to make a move.</p><p>"Not hungry," I said, with a shake of my head.</p><p>"Want to play?" He gestured at the shogi board.</p><p>"It's kinda late," I declined. I really wasn't in the mood for a game anyway.</p><p>"Such an important person, always too busy for a game with her poor father," he teased. It <em> was</em> a tease, but it hit home all the same. Because he'd always made time for us. Always.</p><p>I huffed a laugh, and came to drop down next to him on the couch. "I missed you," I said, dropping my head down on his shoulder and turning on my best exaggerated sad fawn eyes. "You were gone forever. I counted."</p><p>His chest vibrated with a repressed laugh, but all that escaped was a soft puff of air. He dropped his arm over my shoulders and pulled me closer. "It did feel like forever," he agreed.</p><p>I thought he might have brought up the things that had happened while he was gone. He had to know about them. But he didn't.</p><p>"If you have time in the morning," he said, instead. "There's a new clan jutsu I want to show you."</p><p>I made a vague, sleepy sound of assent.</p><p>Apparently, when he said 'you' he meant 'you and Shikamaru'. Which was… obvious and not something I would have ever needed clarification on before.</p><p>And yet, in the morning, I was still somehow surprised.</p><p>We didn't go far. Only out to the back lawn. Dad stayed sitting on the edge of the veranda, a cup of tea steaming gently beside him. It was still early and we were all a bit bleary eyed with sleep.</p><p>"This is something I've been working on these last few months," he said. "It's a new jutsu, but I don't think it will be much harder for you to learn than Shadow Stitching."</p><p>I perked up. I liked learning new things, especially things that weren't just 'new' to me, but entirely new creations. Even Shikamaru looked intrigued, shaking off his sleepy disinterest.</p><p>"What does it do?" I asked.</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched up. "Why don't you tell me?" he asked. He ran through a series of seals - they were not so different from our other jutsu – and reached a hand out towards each of us. I held still as two fingers rested next to the outside of my eye, then curled like claws and <em> dragged</em> across.</p><p>Shadows like black smoke curled through the path his fingers had taken, thick and opaque. His chakra hung heavy and warm across my face, like descending twilight, familiar and friendly.</p><p>I blinked slowly, feeling them catch and drag on my eyelashes. For all that the shadows were dark, I could see through them. Everything was washed out and grey and strangely flat, but I could see.</p><p>"Shadow Sight," Dad said, sitting back. He picked up his tea and held it loosely in his hands, looking prepared to stay there a while.</p><p><em> So what does it do?</em></p><p>I looked around, up and down, stared at my hands and flexed them, scuffed my foot against the ground and leaving an ink mark behind. The low power Flash Seal went off and Dad winced.</p><p>Shikamaru had settled his hands into his thinking pose. He too had a thick band of shadow covering his eyes. I couldn't see them, couldn't tell where he was looking or what expression he was making. It was strangely intimidating.</p><p>I sighed. "Shadow Sight," I said thoughtfully, letting my impressions settle themselves into words. "The band of shadow filters the incoming light, reducing it to a consistent intensity. Shadows aren't visible, and neither are extremes of light."</p><p>That was why everything looked flat and strange. There were no shadows. You never really thought about how common they were, or how you used them to help gauge distance or depth.</p><p>"It'll make our jutsu a little more difficult if we can't tell where the shadows are," I continued, frowning slightly. I tapped my fingers against my lip. "But it would make a good night vision jutsu when light levels are low, and protection from flashbangs and the like. It'll probably be a good defence against visual genjutsu-"</p><p>Beside me, Shikamaru inhaled a sharp breath.</p><p>I stopped and looked at him.</p><p>"Go on," he said, shaking his head.</p><p>"Right," I said doubtfully. I didn't have much more to say, anyway. "Dad?"</p><p>"That's about the size of it," Dad said calmly. "It didn't quite work out how I wanted it to, but it will still be useful in certain situations."</p><p>It would make night time excursions a whole lot easier, that was for sure. Torches were well and good, but it did mean people could see you coming, and there were times when secrecy mattered. And we couldn't really use shadow jutsu well at night anyway, so the downsides were negligible. Well, for me. I had other techniques. Shikamaru might find it a bigger hurdle.</p><p>Dad dispelled the jutsu and my eyes watered slightly as they readjusted to the light. It wasn't especially bright today, but it was enough.</p><p>Then we began the long and laborious process of learning how to do it ourselves.</p><p>It wasn't, as he said, all that different or difficult. But there were subtleties to it. Variations and ways that we needed to twist to make it work. And then we had to hold it. This wasn't an attack, to be used and forgotten, it was something we would have to maintain.</p><p>"You've both improved," Dad said mildly, after we'd been at it for a while. "Your technique is much better than when I left."</p><p>I gave a lazy shrug, still half focused on the jutsu. Shikamaru mirrored me – I knew that without even looking up to see him. Because of course we had; it had been months. It would have been stranger if we hadn't improved.</p><p>"There anything else you want to cover?"</p><p>I hesitated, but it wasn't something I want to bring up with Shikamaru around. I could just <em> see </em> how well that would go.</p><p>I wasn't exactly thrilled to bring it up to dad either, but that was probably slightly more necessary.</p><p>Just… not now.</p><p>Later. I'd do it later.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>Dad gave no indication that he expected any other response. I didn't fool myself into thinking that he hadn't talked to Kasuga, but he was patient. He probably wouldn't push it right now.</p><p><em> How</em> patient he was, I didn't know.</p><p>"Then that's enough for today," he said. "I have to get back to the tower." He stood, groaning, and ambled off with a lazy stride.</p><p>Shikamaru groaned too and flopped backwards onto the ground, staring at the sky. "How troublesome."</p><p>I nudged him with my foot. "You going to stay there all day?"</p><p>He barely moved. "Maybe."</p><p>I rolled my eyes and went back inside.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The Hokage's Office wasn't meant to cram so many people in.</p><p>There was the Rookie Nine, minus Shikamaru and Shino, Team Gai as well as three more teams of Genin who I vaguely remembered making it to the second exam but didn't actually know.</p><p>So yeah, I could <em> guess</em> why we were here, right off the bat.</p><p>"You've all been nominated for the Chunin Exams," Tsunade said briskly, confirming it. "It's being held in Hidden Grass. The format will be a little different from the last one you participated in."</p><p>The Exams happened every six months and cycled around the villages. Since there were only <em> five</em> major villages that meant that once every three years one of the minor hidden villages had a chance to host it.</p><p>It was lucky for us that it had landed on Hidden Grass. We had a non-aggression treaty with them. Well… so did everyone, really. They tried to play all sides and keep all their neighbours happy, because if it <em> did</em> come to war they were in prime position to get trampled all over.</p><p>But this would probably be our last invite to an exam until the roster circled back around to Sand or Konoha. I could not see Tsunade sending a team into Hidden Cloud – especially not now.</p><p>"Unlike the Konoha exams," she went on. "The entire thing will last for one week. All the guests – including myself and the other Kage – will arrive at the beginning and will be observing you through the entire test, rather than just at the tournament. You will not have preparation time before the one-on-one fights, so I suggest you all start planning now."</p><p>Sasuke shifted slightly beside me.</p><p>If Tsunade was coming… if she would be there the whole time… then there was really no safer way to take Sasuke out of the village. Even Orochimaru would think twice about that.</p><p>So this wouldn't just be the only chance we might get for <em> years</em> , it might be the only chance that Sasuke got. Period.</p><p>Well. Okay. We could do this.</p><p>"I don't have to tell you to do your best to represent us." Her gaze swept over us. It was compelling. Collectively, we stood a little straighter. "The Chunin Exam is the one place where we can present ourselves to new clients <em> without</em> danger, and show them that we value ideals like honour and courage. It's a place where we can interact with other villages so that, at the end, everyone walks away. This is much more important than you know – it exceeds promotions or even advertisement<em> .</em> "</p><p>Somehow, I liked Tsunade's speech much more than the Third Hokage's 'this is a replacement for war'.</p><p>We were dismissed from the office and trailed out into the corridor where a bunch of Jounin were waiting. Everyone split up and went to their sensei, almost instinctively, but Kakashi-sensei wasn't there.</p><p>Asuma motioned us over. "Kakashi put your names forward," he said. "But since we have three partial teams, we're going to be combining them. Shikako will be with us, and Sasuke with Kurenai."</p><p>I could see the logic to it. "Ino-Shika-Cho?" I offered, not <em> quite</em> wryly. Ino shrugged a shoulder back at me. It was what it was.</p><p>Kiba knocked his fists together. "Hell yeah, we are going to kick ass."</p><p>Sasuke smirked at him. "Only because I'm with you."</p><p>So this was why Tsunade had recalled so many of her best ninja from the border. Dad and Shizune were going to have to hold the village together while she was away, and the Jounin would be coming with us to represent the village. She was really pulling out all the stops with this 'make an impression' thing.</p><p>"We have a week before we leave," Kurenai said smoothly, interrupting the taunting. "So there's a little bit of time for us to make sure that you're functioning properly as a team."</p><p>I didn't think that would be much of a problem, really. We <em> had</em> worked together, and we all knew each other reasonably well. Maybe we wouldn't be the well-oiled machine of a permanent team, but we wouldn't be a mess either.</p><p>Still, not a bad idea.</p><p>"We'll start with a team verses team match tomorrow and go from there," Asuma finished. "So come prepared."</p><p>Oh. <em> That</em> should be good. My mouth crooked into a smile. Sasuke smirked back at me.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Sensei," I singsonged drawing the word out into all its syllables. "You didn't tell us you'd nominated us for the Exams."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei looked up from his book, projecting an air of complete indifference. "Mah, didn't I? Well. You've been nominated for the Chunin Exams."</p><p>Beside me Sasuke snorted. He shoved his hands into his pockets. "You aren't coming?" He asked.</p><p>Kakashi gave a brief twitch of one shoulder. "I am, actually. Just not as your sensei. I landed the enviable task of standing around looking intimidating."</p><p>He slouched even further, out of what must have been sheer contrariness. It wasn't that he <em> looked</em> especially intimidating, but there would be no one there who didn't know who he was. And the reputation was a fearsome thing.</p><p>I translated the sentence in my head. "As the Hokage's bodyguard?" I clarified. There were limited numbers of people that would be going to an event like this, and few of them could be described as 'standing around'.</p><p>"If she needs it," he said, an amused crinkle forming around his eye. Because, yeah, there was a joke to thinking that Tsunade needed bodyguards.</p><p>"As long as you're there to see us be awesome." I nodded, so overly serious that it wasn't anything but a joke, to cement the statement.</p><p>"That's the plan." Kakashi-sensei nodded back.</p><p>It wasn't that we would be short on Jounin or protection – Tsunade was going to be there – but it was reassuring to know that Kakashi-sensei was still going to be around. And, yeah, okay. There was encouragement to show off for him.</p><p>I split the rest of the afternoon with light training and strategizing, and for once, we were all home for dinner.</p><p>"This is nice, isn't it?" Mum commented. And it wasn't even passive aggressive or a subtle hint in our directions.</p><p>Which probably made it work better than if it had been. I sank just a little lower in my seat.</p><p>After dinner was full of quiet conversation, the clatter of dishes getting washed, and shogi games that I lost horribly. All of it comfortably familiar.</p><p>I stretched out on the couch and turned a game piece over and over in my hands, fingers smoothing over the sides.</p><p>"Little hard to play when you've taken one of the pieces," Dad said, settling himself down beside the board.</p><p>"It's not an important one," I said idly, tracing the kanji for 'pawn' without really looking at it. Upstairs, the shower was running and Shikamaru had settled into bed. I probably wasn't going to get a better opportunity than this. "You can play without it."</p><p>"They're all important ones," Dad corrected easily, without really sounding like he was arguing. "It's not the same game without them."</p><p>I dropped it back on the board, where the last game was still frozen in its final moments. "I lost that game," I said.</p><p>"You did," he agreed, eyes sweeping over the layout. "You know why?"</p><p>"Yes," I said, and rolled onto my side. I had the half aware feeling that we weren't really talking about the game. Or the pieces. "I want to show you-"</p><p>It maybe wasn't the best way to introduce the problem. But, none of the other options that I had come up with were any better, either. At least this way, I didn't have to <em> explain </em> it. Didn't have to put into words 'I am coming apart'.</p><p>He looked up, slow and steady to meet my eyes. The lack of speed gave it an implacable weight, like he was the unstoppable force and immovable object all in one. "Show me what?"</p><p>I closed my eyes and breathed in. I gathered my chakra, divided it neatly in half so that it would be <em> even</em> not that fumbling, terrified thing I'd done accidentally.</p><p>Then I-</p><p>(-<em> pulled</em> .)</p><p>I breathed in. I sat up on the couch.</p><p>(<em> I swelled across the ground, shadow on wood. I didn't want to use too much chakra, didn't want to alarm anyone, but I needed to make it obvious. Needed him to see what I was doing. I formed upwards, entire being flowing into the shape of a hand, solid and black.)</em></p><p>"Show you this," I said. "It's not a clone. Shadow clone. That's a … duplication. Everything you are, repeated again. This is just one of me, but in different places."</p><p>Dad didn't react. He very, very carefully did not react. "Okay," he said. "You can undo it now."</p><p>(<em> I swirled back, twisting around my own ankles, fading into insubstantiality. Then-)</em></p><p>-it was over.</p><p>"How did it happen?" he asked, still calm.</p><p>I could have described the fight. Either of them, the one against Yakumo or the one in the Land of Birds. But the heart of the matter was much more simple. "I was scared," I said. "I wanted to go away."</p><p>I swallowed, and pulled my knees up to my chest. I hated admitting things like that. Hated it even more when it was true.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Dad said, voice heartbreakingly gentle.</p><p>That wasn't what I was expecting. I'd expected disappointment. I'd done the things that I'd been told not to – twisted our jutsu until they broke. We had rules against training alone for this reason.</p><p>"Nothing you could do about it." I ducked my chin down, didn't look at him.</p><p>He moved, slowly and loudly so I saw and heard it, and dropped next to me. An arm wrapped around me. "I know," he said. "That's why I'm sorry." I wondered, suddenly, if the gentleness was for him and not for me.</p><p>Maybe it was.</p><p>"I'm sorry," I echoed back. "I didn't want-"</p><p>Didn't want to hurt anyone with it. But, I couldn't even say I hadn't wanted it.</p><p>I had been… not sure, exactly. But confident I could handle it. Willing to take the risk. And it hadn't backfired. The jutsu had still been useful, still done what I'd needed it to do even if I hadn't <em> known</em> that I'd needed it. But it had shaken me, and I was less certain that I had a grip on it, now. Wasn't sure I was as in control as I needed to be.</p><p>"It will be okay, dearheart," Dad said into my hair. I curled even closer to him. "We can work through this."</p><p>I noticed, though, that he didn't promise we could fix it.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Grass Chunin Exam Arc: Chapter 89</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 89</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> One's destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things ~ Henry Miller</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Okay," Asuma-sensei said, lighting a cigarette. A curl of smoke drifted gently into the air. Kurenai-sensei was waiting further out, with Shikamaru and Shino who technically hadn't been invited but had shown up to watch their teams anyway. "Go."</p><p>He dropped his hand.</p><p>For a fraction of a second, none of us moved, poised tense in a moment of <em> potential.</em></p><p>Then Sasuke brought his hands together and breathed fire.</p><p>It sizzled the air in front of us, blocked sight, caused my shadow to extend backwards away from it. But it was a distraction, not an attack. I stood my ground, used a kunai to deflect the shuriken that burst out of it, jigged my shadow back and past Ino and Chouji to create a line of defense.</p><p>Hinata burst forward, through the fire, hand extended and glowing with Jyuuken, aiming for Chouji. But I'd sensed her coming, was ready for it, and she had to backtrack rapidly to avoid being caught as my shadow pulled away from Chouji towards her.</p><p>I forced her back even further with a kunai-exploding tag combo into the ground in front of her, then had to twist and avoid Sasuke when he popped out of the ground beneath my feet.</p><p>"Not fair, that's my move," I said, rolling across the ground.</p><p>"Everything is fair," Sasuke retorted.</p><p>Then Chouji's enlarged hand smashed down where he was standing and he had to make a hasty dodge to avoid being paste.</p><p>I smirked.</p><p>Then raced through hand seals, lashed a hand out to my left and caught Kiba with a lightning jutsu where he and Akamaru were trying to corner Ino. They hadn't gone Man-Beast Clone yet, but the fight had barely started.</p><p>Ino took advantage of his stagger, stretched her palms forward and used a pulse of chakra. "Summoning: Hidden Tongue Hands!"</p><p>Chameleon tongues, I discovered, were really damn fast. A pair of them unfolded from the sleeves of her purple jacket, uncurling into the air and wrapping around their target. It was a technique that gave me a moment's pause and I wondered if the idea had come from Orochimaru's memories – but combat wasn't the time or place for those questions and it didn't matter anyway.</p><p>Kiba pivoted, struggling against the bindings but getting enough momentum to generate a Tunneling Fang and wrench himself free.</p><p>It was clear already that when it came down to firepower Team Kurenai clearly outranked us with heavy hitters. We had to even the playing field.</p><p>I leapt upwards, taking the disadvantage of making myself a target, and pulled out a scroll.</p><p>Then I unsealed it and dropped a pillar of rock on them.</p><p>"What the <em> fuck</em> ?" Sasuke yelped, diving for safety.</p><p>It wasn't <em> huge</em> compared to the others I'd sealed. Maybe two meters diameter. The height of a tree. It didn't extend across the length of the training field, and the spectators stood no chance of being hit, but it made a nice distraction.</p><p>It plummeted down. I hadn't sealed movement with it, but it was a huge, heavy chunk of rock released in mid-air. It fell. Hit the ground and skidded, ripping up the grass.</p><p>Team Kurenai regrouped, leapt over it or onto it. Sasuke was smart enough – knew me well enough - to check it carefully first, which meant he noticed the explosive seals on the underside before I set them off.</p><p>Dirt went everywhere. But in this group, limited visibility really only hampered a few. It wasn't a viable tactic to gain an upper hand.</p><p>I pulled out a brace of kunai, wrapped flash tags around the handle, calculated the angles of the shadows and scattered them around the field.</p><p><em> If I can just pin them…</em></p><p>But I couldn't follow through because Chouji was having problems with Hinata – taijutsu verses a Hyuuga was no good and once she started shutting down his chakra system, he couldn't even use his jutsu.</p><p>"Earth Style; Earth Style Wall!" I raced through the hand seals and lifted up the earth beneath her feet.</p><p>She pirouetted off, barely disturbed, but Ino followed up with kunai and ninja wire, trying to drive her back even further.</p><p>But two of them tied up fighting Hinata meant there were still three enemies moving freely on the field – Sasuke, Kiba and Akamaru.</p><p>Outnumbered <em> and</em> outgunned.</p><p>I launched out another lightning jutsu, dropped my resistance seal and boosted as much chakra into speed as I could.</p><p>It still wasn't enough to take Sasuke by surprise. He saw me coming, retreated out of shadow possession range, and breathed fire to prevent me from following.</p><p>I dropped underground, popping up beneath Kiba and pulling him knee deep in the dirt. But Ino wasn't in position to take advantage of it, in a deadlock with Hinata and Chouji was –</p><p>An enlarged hand smashed into me.</p><p>I tumbled into Kiba, who grabbed me. It took a few seconds to use Shadow Possession and make him let go and then Akamaru was there, teeth bared.</p><p>I used a replacement jutsu to get clear across the field and drop down behind Chouji. That hadn't been a miss or a mistake. I'd been hit with friendly fire. Sasuke's chakra was burning like an ember with in him. Genjutsu then, of some sort. Sasuke didn't often use genjutsu, but it was foolishness to forget that when he did – he was good at it.</p><p>Grudgingly, I was impressed. But not happy.</p><p>I jumped on Chouji's back, clamped my hands down on his shoulders and pumped a burst of chakra into his system.</p><p>The genjutsu he was under shattered and broke.</p><p>"Shadow Sight!" I commanded, pulling my chakra across his eyes in a band of shadow. That would at least stop Sasuke trying again. It was harder to hold it on someone else, it probably wouldn't last long, but it would do for now.</p><p>I leapt off.</p><p>Kiba had pulled himself free with Akamaru's help but Sasuke was busy fighting off Hinata. Ino was standing behind her, hands set in a squared seal I didn't recognize, but clearly responsible for the role reversal.</p><p>But she was totally exposed.</p><p>I crossed the space in a body flicker, sweeping into a crouch beside her, hands already folded into a seal. My shadow flicked out around us, a circular wall of defense.</p><p>I saw Kiba recognize the threat, try to abort the attack he was already running. His feet slid over the ground, chakra ripping it up and scratching for purchase.</p><p>Then I set off the flare tag waiting patiently behind us, and my shadow flared out, stretching long over the training field.</p><p>"Shadow Possession Complete," I said heavily.</p><p>"Okay," Asuma-sensei interrupted. "That's enough."</p><p>It wasn't that we'd won. That was barely a pause in a real fight. Shadow Possession was good but it wasn't a complete victory. Sasuke alone knew more than a few ways to keep the fight going from there.</p><p>"That was something," Asuma-sensei said dryly. He regarded the training field with a bland, unimpressed face.</p><p>"Something," Ino mimicked, pushing her sweaty hair out of her face.</p><p>"He's not wrong," I agreed, tiredly. I dropped down to sit on a less-dirty patch of grass. "We don't train together enough. I had no idea that you'd managed those summoning jutsu."</p><p>"It's new," Ino said with a shrug.</p><p>Which explained it, but didn't excuse it. Because I'd thought that I knew how Ino fought, what jutsu she could use and how she would act… and I'd been wrong.</p><p>"We kept waiting for you to give us a plan of attack like Shikamaru would," she offered after a brief second, referring to herself and Chouji. "The three of us weren't coordinated."</p><p>"The plan <em> was</em> 'attack'," I retorted. But I thought I could see her point. We – Team 7 – didn't often lay out complicated plans and strategies, but Kakashi-sensei had put us through enough rigorous team building exercises that we <em> knew</em> how the rest would react to something. And that just got factored into our own individual plans automatically, so that the three of us could operate independently together in the same fight.</p><p>Team 10 was different. Team 10 had <em> formations.</em></p><p>"Yeah," Ino said dryly. "I get that."</p><p>Asuma-sensei coughed, like he was trying not to laugh.</p><p>"Same with us," Sasuke drawled. "We weren't coordinated."</p><p>"Sounds like you know where you went wrong then," Asuma-sensei said. "That makes things easier."</p><p>"We'll work on it," Kurenai-sensei agreed, moving closer now that the fighting was over. Beside her, Shino was inscrutable, but Shikamaru at least looked satisfactorily surprised.</p><p><em> Hah,</em> I thought with relish, <em> didn't think I could do that, did you?</em></p><p>This hadn't been full out, no holds barred, fighting but it was probably more than he'd seen me actually do before. We generally only trained with clan jutsu together and the few missions we'd done together hadn't been exceptional. We'd split up to face the Sound Four, and Gelel had ended badly.</p><p>The two teams split up, but we only really went to opposite ends of the training field, so it wasn't like we were trying to stay secret from each other. Asuma-sensei drilled me in a few of Team 10's common formations, and we got to try and apply some of them to a target.</p><p>It was unusual for me to be the one calling the shots – usually I just followed Naruto (if he jumped the gun) or Sasuke's lead for it – but I tried. It only took us a couple of hours before we were improvising off each other.</p><p>Then we had Round Two.</p><p>"I can't believe you invented an anti-Sharingan jutsu," Sasuke grumbled at me, after we were all finished.</p><p>"It's not an anti-" I started to protest and trailed off.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Well. How about that. And I would bet that Shikamaru had picked up on it, too hadn't he? 'Good defense against visual genjutsu'. I'd really understated that one, hadn't I?</p><p>"At least it will be helpful," I said, a little wearily.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The week passed in mostly the same fashion, with team training taking up most of our time. At home, dad was putting a lot of effort into helping me with the shadow split. There were no recorded techniques in any of the clan archives – unsurprising – but the base reason behind it was not unknown.</p><p>Granted, a lot of the information seemed to come from hospital reports from people that <em> hadn't </em> coped with it. If that didn't tell me I was walking a thin line, nothing would.</p><p>The strangest part was trying to control <em> where</em> I split. I could make it even or uneven, put more of myself into one part or the other, but it was hard to control <em> what</em> parts.</p><p>Because I couldn't tell.</p><p>It wasn't until the jutsu was active that it became obvious.</p><p>It wasn't, specifically, memories or knowledge or techniques although that was part of it. I'd had the unnerving discovery, that if I made the Split too strong, my own shadow techniques became very weak – sometimes I couldn't even manage them at all.</p><p>"The problem with spiritual jutsu is that the requirements are vague," Dad said, moving a shoji piece on the board.</p><p>I considered. Picked up a piece, changed my mind and put it back down. I could see my Shadow Split out the corner of my eye, running through a Shadow Stitching routine that Dad had suggested. It was … odd to see.</p><p><em> I've lost something,</em> Ino had told me, <em> and I don't know what.</em></p><p>I could understand that feeling.</p><p>I lost the game. It wasn't surprising. But dad frowned faintly at the board.</p><p>Once I cancelled the technique, I could see why.</p><p>"Reckless," I said, touching a fingertip to a piece in a terrible position. It wasn't the only one. All over the board I could see it, touches of strategies that I disagreed with.</p><p>"Very," he agree, soberly. "And you didn't even notice."</p><p>I hadn't. I could see it now, see it easily, and it was worrying. I wasn't making decisions to the best of my ability when I was using that technique, because I didn't have access to my full self.</p><p>I ran a hand over my face and sighed. "That's a problem."</p><p>"I wouldn't recommend using it," Dad said quietly. "But that's a decision you'll have to make in the field, based on the information you have at the time. Just be careful not to leave your common sense behind."</p><p>He ruffled my hair. The words might have been a joke, but the meaning behind them was pretty serious.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We left the village at midday. It wasn't exactly a subtle thing; there were a lot of us, for one thing, and Tsunade gave a speech and we basically had an entire procession walking out the gates.</p><p>There was a strangely amped atmosphere jittering through the group of us. Tension, but of a mingled excitement and anticipation, rather than fear.</p><p>We weren't all travelling as a big group – we sort of spread out like a string. Team Kurenai ended up at the leading edge, with Team Asuma and Team Gai trailing after. Tsunade was somewhere in the middle of the pack – either to keep an eye on everyone or in order to be rapidly deployed in any direction in case of disaster.</p><p>"It is most exciting for us all to be participating in the Exams once more!" Lee enthused, very loudly. "I wish to face you in the tournament, Neji! Then we may settle, once and for all, which of us is the better fighter!"</p><p>Neji didn't sigh, but it looked like a masterful restraint. "We fight all the time, Lee."</p><p>"Yeah," Kiba said, calling back over his shoulder. "It's not like we have that many secret techniques to surprise each other with this time!"</p><p>"It could be more fun that way," I suggested, though quietly and to Ino beside me. They could probably hear me, but I wasn't shouting. "I mean, we <em> are</em> supposed to be showing off here."</p><p>The slow, devious smirk curled at her lips. "Oh yes," Ino agreed. "If I fight you, you <em> better</em> let me use my summons."</p><p>I laughed. "It's a deal."</p><p>"I'll let you use them," Chouji agreed, too. "But you have to let me use my Bullet Tank."</p><p>We argued back and forth. Kiba wanted to use his Double-Headed Wolf form, though he did agree not to actually use the Fang Wolf Fang against anything that might, yknow, die because of it. Since I'd seen what that had done to Kidomaru, I was in full support.</p><p>And a bit of clever wrangling from Hinata got an agreement that Dynamic Marking probably wasn't the kind of impressive jutsu people wanted to see. Nicely done.</p><p>Lee, unsurprisingly, immediately swore he would go all the way to five gates. That also got argued down rapidly.</p><p>Asuma-sensei chuckled, though it sounded admiring. I took that to mean that the sensei wouldn't protest our match rigging. "Oh, they were right. You <em> are</em> going to be trouble."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Grass Chunin Exam Arc: Chapter 90</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>A.N.: Fell's Apprentice has started a DOS forum called 'We're all Dreaming of Sunshine' if anyone wants to go and check it out.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 90</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Sunlight sends you on your way</p><p>And those restless thoughts that cling to yesterday</p><p>Never be afraid of change</em></p><p><em> ~Bic Runga; Listening for the Weather</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Land of Grass was pretty much as advertised.</p><p>Land.</p><p>And grass.</p><p>It was prairie land, stretching out in an endless unbroken horizon of grass. It was strangely uncomfortable to leave behind the closeness of the forest and venture into a place where you could see everything in all directions. I wasn't the only one that seemed glad we wouldn't have to camp out here – as much as we could see everything around us, everything could also see <em> us.</em></p><p>"What's that?" Ino asked, squinting into the distance to our right. She shielded her eyes with her hands. "Asuma-sensei?"</p><p>There <em> was</em> something there, far off and barely visible, and it wasn't natural unless there were some strangely regular mountains around here.</p><p>"Hozuki Castle," Asuma-sensei said, briefly glancing at it. "Also called the 'Blood Prison' occasionally. Supposedly the most secure prison facility in the entire Elemental Nations. It's nominally under the control of Hidden Grass, but you'll find most villages make use of it."</p><p>"I've heard of it," she acknowledged, losing interest now that the question was answered.</p><p>So had I. I'd thought it would be more … remote though. Prairie land didn't exactly seem impassable.</p><p>There was a kind of tension to the group now, more controlled and serious than on any of the trip over. We all bunched together, no longer spread out in separate teams, the closer we got to our destination.</p><p>"So this is Hidden Grass, huh?" Kiba asked, once we started closing in on the bustling, small village.</p><p>"Actually, no," came the response. Tsunade moved up through the group, until she was at the head of it, leading the charge towards the village. "Hidden Grass is further west. This settlement has been built specifically for the exams – to host the influx of visitors and provide entertainment throughout the week to all the dignitaries."</p><p>Which wasn't so far removed from what countries had done for the Olympics, a lifetime ago. And it was probably better for village security to <em> not</em> let so many foreign ninja walk around. Especially when there were so many.</p><p>"They call these the 'festival exams'," Kurenai said, offhand. "The number of participants can sometimes be up to ten times as many as at other Chunin Exams."</p><p>"The promotions, too," Asuma said, glancing at her.</p><p>The only response she granted him was a swift flick of her eyes. "That doesn't mean it will be easier," she countered. "No matter what some people might say. The judges are just as strict. But you might have more opportunities to be seen."</p><p>Their teasing by play was interesting but self-evident. We were a little more interested in trying to scope out the playing field we were about to enter.</p><p>There was gate security that tried to seem more like a welcoming committee, but they gave us a pretty thorough once over anyway. I didn't know what they thought they were looking for, because Tsunade had put on her Hokage hat and was clearly <em> Tsunade.</em> If we were going to try anything, that was about all we'd need.</p><p>"The Konoha housing section is this way," the Chunin said, once we were inside. "Village sections are all isolated, and you're recommended not to try and enter the units of other villages but security is at the discretion of the occupants."</p><p>Translation – don't try sneak in and sabotage your opponents, because they've probably trapped their rooms and you will die. Very nice.</p><p>"Dining is provided in the communal hall," she continued. "But you're also welcome to manage your own meals or to dine out in the many restaurants around the village."</p><p>The Konoha section was a set of little camp houses arranged in a horseshoe shape. They were pretty basic, lined with bunk beds, but each one had a contained bathroom so it was far from rustic accommodation.</p><p>"Hmm," Tsunade said, though she sounded neither approving or disapproving. "Kurenai; set up a ward so we don't get any uninvited guests. Kakashi; make yourself useful and set a perimeter."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei sighed from behind his Icha Icha and loped off. Kurenai ran through a set of hand seals and a … <em> something</em> fell over the campsite. I didn't notice any changes, but I could feel it hovering in the air all the same. Interesting.</p><p>"Stash your gear," the Hokage continued, aimed at us, this time. "And make sure you're back by dinner time. Until then, your time is your own. Don't get into trouble and I don't want anyone wandering around alone. Go in pairs, at the least."</p><p>We shrugged and did as we were told. There was a whole lot to explore.</p><p><hr /></p><p>It really was like a festival.</p><p>Games and gambling and food stalls and people moving around in colourful clothing. Not everyone here was a ninja, far from it, and not all the ninja were competitors. There were quite a few that seemed to be sticking with the noble entourages, hired to protect them in an atmosphere that, if it turned violent, could go to hell extremely quickly.</p><p>But it was fun.</p><p>"Well, well, well," a familiar and mocking voice said. "If it isn't <em> Hidden Leaf</em> ."</p><p>I grinned. "Well, well, well," I mocked back. "If it isn't <em> Hidden Sand</em> ."</p><p>Beside me, Ino and Chouji were a little uncomfortable, but Sasuke gave a reasonably polite nod in their direction. None of them had been there the last time I'd caught up with the Sand Siblings, but Sasuke at least had been there when they'd helped us against Kimimaro.</p><p>Kankurou sighed theatrically. "I suppose it was too much to hope that we could get through this without running into you, sparky."</p><p>"If this is what you call evasion, you might want to work on it," I said dryly. He had been the one to call out, after all. "I guess I don't need to ask if you're competing?"</p><p>I was a little surprised to see them, though it did make sense. It was just… Gaara was going to be Kazekage. Hidden Sand <em> still</em> didn't have one, but they wouldn't hold out much longer, surely? I mean, I could understand why it was taking so long but the longer they left it the weaker they seemed.</p><p>"We are," Kankurou agreed readily enough. "Time to show the rest of these punks what Suna can do."</p><p>"Well," Sasuke said, when the silence stretched a beat too long. "Maybe we can have a rematch."</p><p>I gave him an incredulous look out the corner of my eye. I wasn't exactly the only one, either.</p><p>Gaara appeared slightly baffled but nodded. "That would be… acceptable," he rasped slowly. "I look forward to it."</p><p>"Sure," I agreed to nobody, since apparently that was it. Boys. "How did the cleanup go, after the thing?"</p><p>Temari gave a short shrug. "It was complicated," she said. "But everyone seemed happy at the end." Her expression seemed to indicate that this was nothing short of a miracle. "Your friend sailed home. The Daimyo even came to see him off. There was fanfare."</p><p>I made a sound of surprise at that. We grouped together and started moving back to the direction of the competitor housing.</p><p>"Yeah," Kankurou agreed. "I have no idea how Gaara managed to organize that one. I think the Daimyo likes him," he confided in a false whisper.</p><p>"That's good?" I offered, trying not to sound so uncertain. I caught Gaara's eye.</p><p>"It is," he confirmed, voice quiet. "It is important for the village to have strong ties to the Daimyo."</p><p>"I don't know how this happened," Kankurou lamented. "We take him to Hidden Leaf a murderous psychopath and you send him back a budding politician. Where did it all go wrong?"</p><p>"Kankurou!" Temari bit out, taking half a step towards him like she wanted to drag him out of the way.</p><p>I coughed. "Well. Happy to help," I said awkwardly. "Uh. Politics. Liaising with the Daimyo? That kind of thing?"</p><p>"I am going to be Kazekage," Gaara said, flatly. He didn't say it like Naruto did, a boast and a rebellion all in one. He said it like a lot of people had told him he couldn't, and he didn't care.</p><p>I nodded. "Pretty important stuff to know then." Well, at least that was one thing that wasn't changing. Gaara being Kazekage was kinda important. I'd hate to have screwed that up.</p><p>There was a long pause. That seemed to be the theme of this conversation.</p><p>"Naruto really did get to you," Sasuke said, with a tinge of resignation in his voice.</p><p>"He," Gaara rasped. "Inspired me. I wanted to be … accepted like he was. I want to be someone that Suna looks at with admiration, not fear."</p><p>"You'll be a great Kazekage," I said, reassuringly, nudging open the doors to the dining hall. There was an abrupt silence as everyone inside went quiet to stare at us.</p><p>And wow, there were a lot of people.</p><p>There was a very large group from Hidden Rock, maybe 50 people. An equally large sized group from Hidden Cloud across the other side of the room, who appeared to be trying to stab us with their gaze alone. Various sized groups of minor villages – I saw Waterfall headbands but no one that I recognized. Given that we'd hung out with Fuu and some Academy students, that wasn't so surprising.</p><p>One thing I had noticed was that there was no team size for entering the exams. Last time it had been Konoha standard three man teams, but other villages didn't really follow that trend. Rock teams were usually much larger, eight Genin led by a Chunin for example, and others tended to send out ninja in ones or twos. The three man teams had caught on with Cloud and partially in Sand simply because they were so effective. That could make things … interesting if it came down to team versus team.</p><p>The Jounin weren't really mixing with the Genin so much – ours had a table all to themselves and Tsunade and Kakashi-sensei weren't even there – but the ones I could see basically looked like the Bingo book had come to life. There was a lot of firepower in this room.</p><p>"Over here!" Kiba called, even though we were already moving in that direction. "We got a table. Might need to pull another one over, though." He gave an only-a-little-too-sharp grin to the Sand Siblings.</p><p>"Man, am I starving," Chouji said. "I hope the food is good."</p><p>It was buffet style, so we took a plate (or two or three in some cases) and served ourselves, ignoring the many eyes that followed us any time we stood up. Clearly people were starting to seize up the competition.</p><p>"Jeeze, look at that fatty with all those plates," someone said, deliberately too loud.</p><p>Chouji <em> turned.</em></p><p>Hastily I wedged myself under his arm, shoulder into his side and forced him back around. And readied my shadow to pin him, if I had to.</p><p>"Pass me some of the dumplings, Chouji?" I asked hastily, trying to redirect. The last thing we wanted was for Chouji to start a fight right here at such blatant and deliberate provocation.</p><p>Ino wedged herself into his other side. "What do you think of the chicken? It looks burnt."</p><p>He didn't look pacified, anger still burning in his eyes, but apparently food won out. Thankfully.</p><p>The Sand Siblings had gone tense and battle ready, but hadn't backed away. So apparently if we were going to get into a brawl in the middle of a dining hall, they would have our backs. To some extent anyway.</p><p>I couldn't tell who'd said it, but I kept an eye on the crowd as much as they were watching us. We shouldn't forget that they were competition, and ninja didn't play nice.</p><p>"I'm sure they didn't mean it, Chouji," Hinata said softly.</p><p>"We'll crush them in the fighting," Kiba chimed in, not refuting her but not agreeing, either. They clearly <em> had</em> meant it. "Then they'll have nothing to say."</p><p>Chouji sniffed indignantly. "I'm just big boned," he said, loading up another plate and balancing it easily on his forearm. That was getting into some fancy waiter skills territory there.</p><p>"Are you sure you don't want some salad with that?" Ino said despairingly. "Eat something healthy." They had a mini duel over the vegetables as she tried to put them on his plate and he tried to very skillfully avoid it. It might have been the smoothest agility exercise I'd seen Chouji do all week.</p><p>Tension successfully broken, we jostled our way back to the table, laughing and slinging quips at each other. I was relieved to see that Lee was making polite conversation with Gaara – bless him – and Kiba couldn't seem to resist verbally poking at Kankurou. Who couldn't resist poking back. Temari sat at the head of the table like a reigning queen but seemed willing enough to join every time we tried to drag her into conversation.</p><p>Then about halfway through dinner, the front doors swept open and silence fell like a lead weight.</p><p>I cut off in mid word, and twisted to see who it was.</p><p>There were only four of them, and no Jounin in sight. The oldest was only a few years older than us.</p><p>I kicked Sasuke under the table, slid out of my seat and wound my way through the tables towards them.</p><p>"Haku!" I beamed. "I didn't realize you would be here!"</p><p>The last I'd heard, they we're still with the Rebellion. In order to be at the actual Chunin Exams, they had to have succeeded.</p><p>Haku ducked his chin and smiled. "Yes, the Fifth Mizukage wished to send a delegation to the Chunin Exams so that we could establish a diplomatic rapport with the rest of the villages."</p><p>It sounded like a very scripted response, but it probably was. The rest of the hall was clearly eavesdropping on us, anyway. This would get back to every village intelligence division ASAP no doubt.</p><p>Tentatively, I stepped forward to give him a hug. Being out in front of everyone made me self-conscious, but it was good to see him.</p><p>Sasuke even shook his hand in greeting, which was weirdly formal, but still a pretty big gesture of trust between two ninja.</p><p>"Is Naruto-kun not here?" Haku asked, eyes sliding past us.</p><p>I shook my head. "No, he was promoted at the last exam," I explained, leading them towards our table. "He'll be really sorry that he missed seeing you."</p><p>"You're here alone?" Sasuke asked, hands in his pockets.</p><p>"Zabuza-sama is also here," Haku said, with another small smile. "But he is currently with the Mizukage greeting the others. We only just arrived."</p><p>"You must be hungry then," I said. "I'm sure there's still time for you to eat. You can squeeze in with us." I hoped the others wouldn't mind <em> too</em> much. I gave some brief introductions. "We met Haku on our first mission out of the village. And these are our friends from the Hidden Sand."</p><p>Haku bowed very politely. As far as ambassadors for a new face of the 'Bloody Mist' went, they could have done a whole lot worse than Haku.</p><p>Surprisingly, Gaara stood and bowed back. "I am pleased to meet any friend of Team 7," he rasped.</p><p>"This is Chojuro," Haku introduced the blue haired boy beside him. "And this is Shiku, and Yoro." He gestured to the two identical girls in smart looking kimono dresses over the same kind of heavy turtleneck that seemed to be a Hidden Mist staple. One had '46' on her shoulder, the other '49', which seemed to be the only way to tell them apart. They were young enough that it was significant even to us – maybe eight or nine years old.</p><p>"<em> Yoroshiku</em> ," they chorused in unison, bowing. Chojuro ducked his head and looked like he was cringing.</p><p>A spatter of laughter escaped me. I wasn't the only one, either. Lee bounced to his feet – on the seating bench, even, so he towered above the table - and beamed at them. "What an excellent greeting! I am very pleased to meet you as well!"</p><p>Neji subtly tried to pull him back down. Tenten was laughing into her hands. Or crying. I couldn't tell.</p><p>We squeezed together around the table, creating space for them to sit once they had food. It wasn't exactly comfortable, and I ended up half sitting on Chouji, but most of us were finished eating anyway.</p><p>"You did not say he was gorgeous," Ino hissed to me, while they were at the buffet table getting food and out of earshot.</p><p>"Pretty sure that story always gets told with 'oh, yeah, and Naruto thought he was a pretty girl' in there somewhere," I responded dryly, craning my neck to look at her.</p><p>"Naruto," she said dismissively as if that explained everything and tried to see her reflection in the back of a spoon. "I should have done my hair."</p><p>"Your hair is fine," I said patiently. "And there's no fighting so that already makes this 200% better than how we met."</p><p>We didn't exactly bombard them with questions when they got back – we did have some manners – but the conversation was distinctly lopsided.</p><p>"I didn't realize you were still a Genin," I admitted to Haku.</p><p>He smiled. "I was never officially ranked. I was Zabuza's apprentice, and that was enough. I was happy like that, but Mei-sama wanted a team to represent the village in these exams and I was chosen for it."</p><p>That made sense, I guessed. And it was a good loophole to exploit to be able to enter a contestant such as Haku. I wasn't kidding with that – if we were sure bets to make it to the finals, then so was he.</p><p>"It seems risky to come to the Exams if you've only just taken over," Sasuke said neutrally.</p><p>"It is," Haku admitted. "However, it is also a perfect venue for us to introduce Kirigakure under the hand of the Fifth Mizukage and to show the Elemental nations how it differs from the previous rule. No longer are we the 'Bloody Mist' village and the sooner we shake that reputation, the better."</p><p>It sounded a little bit like a rehearsed statement, if I was honest, but since everyone was listening in there were probably things that he was supposed to be saying. Well, if Haku needed to drop intelligence to the other villages, then I didn't exactly mind being a shill.</p><p>"And what <em> are</em> the values of the new Hidden Mist?" I asked. "What does the new Mizukage intend?"</p><p>"Mei-sama is of the Terumi clan," Haku said. "And a holder of two bloodlimits. So, of course, the first thing she wishes to do is to stop the persecution of bloodlines within the Land of Water. Many of us fled, so the gates of Kirigakure will be opened to all, ninja or otherwise, that wish to return."</p><p>"All?" I parroted, though it made sense. Of course she would want the strength of the village to return. And half of the missing ninja were probably people that didn't <em> like</em> how the previous Mizukage had been running the place anyway.</p><p>"Yes," Haku said with another quick smile. "All of them. Those that have committed crimes would be given a second chance, though they would have to abide strictly to the new laws and regulations. Which will ensure that all citizens are protected and that the excesses of the last regime will not be repeated."</p><p>There were a lot of eyes on him now, and not everyone was trying to be subtle about it.</p><p>"As for what Mei-sama intends…" He paused. "Well, I'm sure it's much the same as what your Hokage intends. For us to be strong enough to protect ourselves and to maintain strong alliances with those around us, so that there is no needless fighting and war."</p><p>I almost wanted to applaud. It was a good speech.</p><p>"Mei-sama wants us all to be friends!" one of the girls piped up in a high, cutesy voice.</p><p>"Then we'll be friends," Ino declared, smiling at her. "But that means you have to learn the secret friendship handshake."</p><p>Lee gasped, loudly and dramatically. "Can … can <em> I</em> learn the secret friendship handshake?" He begged. "Please, Ino-san?"</p><p>My shoulders shook with repressed laughter. Lee was really the best.</p><p>"Moron," Kiba said, shaking his head. I kicked him under the table too.</p><p>"Don't be mean," Hinata reprimanded softly. But then she spoke up, a little louder. "We can all learn the- the secret friendship handshake."</p><p>"Yeah, sure," Ino said. She may have rolled her eyes. "Friendship for everyone. Come on then."</p><p>The handshake involved many more motions than just shaking hands, of course. For something that was undoubtedly made up on the spot, it was very intense and complicated.</p><p>"Seriously?" Kankurou muttered under his breath, folding his arms.</p><p>Temari elbowed him in the ribs. "Just do it," she hissed. She didn't look all that impressed, either, but Gaara was impassively following the directions. Even Neji was, actually, though that may have been an actual result of Lee repeatedly grabbing his hands and moving them.</p><p>And somehow we managed to get sixteen people around a table doing a fist bump at once. That was slightly impressive.</p><p>"There, now its official," Ino said, grinning brightly. Which might have been just a side effect of getting everyone to do such a silly thing. I wouldn't put it past her. It was just more proof that she didn't need her jutsu to make people do what she wanted.</p><p>"Thank you," Haku said solemnly. "We're honoured."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Grass Chunin Exam Arc -1st: Chapter 91</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: A couple of things that people ask – Profile links appear to be mostly broken at this stage, so they just re-direct back to the profile. This seems to be an FFNet problem related to their most recent update. All Deviantart fanart is favourited on my profile there (Silver-Queen) so that should be easy enough to find. Otherwise, the DOS Chapter Guide site has some of it, and the DOSbysilverqueen tumblr has most of it as well, so thank jacksgreyson for that.</p><p>Also, yes. I welcome anyone that wants to make fanart or videos or fanfiction based around or set in the DOS-verse. Just drop me a line so I can favourite it and find it, because I adore seeing it all.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 91</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle. ~</em> <em> Napoleon Hill</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The morning dawned and we all gathered to start the exams. It wasn't exactly an early start, but most of the town was still quiet, a stark contrast to the late night festivities that had continued on.</p><p>We hadn't exactly stayed up to participate, no matter how tempting, because <em> this</em> was why we were here.</p><p>If I'd thought that the dining hall had been crammed full of firepower, that was nothing compared to the field this morning. Not only had all the Jounin escorted their teams down here before splitting off to stand at the sidelines… the village leaders were all here too. The Kage – and the Raikage had Killer B at one shoulder and Yugito Nii at the other; he wasn't playing around – but the minor village leaders as well. I saw Shibuki, the leader of Hidden Waterfall, hovering behind Tsunade.</p><p>It was honestly more intimidating than the competitors around us. And there were a lot of those. Konoha had sent seven teams and it looked like we had been conservative, even compared to the minor villages. Kurenai might not have been overselling it when she'd said there would be ten times as many entries.</p><p>"Welcome to the Hidden Grass Chunin Exams," the Hidden Grass village leader said, voice echoing loudly over the jam packed field. "We're delighted to have you all here. I could spend the next ten minutes telling you as much, but I think you're all quite eager to begin. Therefore, all I will say is – I hope you enjoy the challenges we have designed for you, and that you represent your villages well."</p><p>He stepped back, ceding the space to an older woman wearing a variation of the Hidden Grass flak jacket. Possibly she was the Jounin Commander, or some kind of high up equivalent, if Grass were as specific with their uniforms as we were.</p><p>"The First Exam," she began. "Will begin as soon as you leave this field. Each team will receive a list from the examination station. You will then proceed into the village and locate, identify, or retrieve all the items on the list!"</p><p>A scavenger hunt, in other words. A host of low murmurings broke out in the crowd, rolling like a wave through the assembled Genin.</p><p>She raised a hand and we all fell silent.</p><p>"Once you have completed the list, you will return here. If you have not finished by five o'clock; you will be disqualified. If your entire team is not present; you will be disqualified."</p><p>That left a whole lot of open ground. Actually, it more than implied that there <em> would</em> be fighting.</p><p>"Wait!" One of the braver Genin near the front of the pack shouted out. He was from Grass, so probably felt a little more secure asking questions. "In the village? Is it empty?"</p><p>"Of course not," she replied, seeming amused. "Those people are your potential clients and employers. They have come all this way to see you in action. It would be foolish on our part to deny them such an opportunity. You should simply remember that however you involve them here and now will reflect upon you and your village."</p><p><em> Translation; hurt them and you'll be in trouble.</em> Tsunade might actually kill us if that happened. Or worse, make sure we never left the village again.</p><p>That added an extra level of complication to what was seeming like it might already be very convoluted. Urban warfare with a lot of civilians around that couldn't be touched. Well, it was good Exam design, I'd give them that.</p><p>Should be fun.</p><p>We got into line as the crowd slowly moved through the examination stations, picking up our list and getting ticked off as officially competing.</p><p>"Looks like we've all got different lists," Ino observed, as we had a quick huddle with Team Gai and Team Kurenai.</p><p>"Wouldn't be much of an exam if we all had the same twenty targets," I said, shrugging. All you'd have to do then would be follow the huge line of people walking from one destination to the next.</p><p>"Race ya," Kiba challenged. "I bet we'll be the first team back. This is exactly our kind of mission."</p><p>It did play to their skills quite well. But it wasn't too far from ours, either.</p><p>"You're on," Ino agreed, eyes narrowing. "See you at the finish line."</p><p>"We will compete as well!" Lee agreed, boisterously. "We shall be the fastest! Neji! Tenten! Let us go now."</p><p>"Wait, Lee!" Tenten said, grabbing at him. "Give me the list! We don't know where the first one is yet!"</p><p>We slipped off with a parting wave. Hinata had her Byakugan active and it looked like Team Kurenai were strategizing over where to go first. They would be fine.</p><p>It was lucky that we had spent some time exploring yesterday, because it meant we had some idea of where to go as we deciphered the clues.</p><p>"This is as far as you go, Leaf." A group of Rock ninja blocked the street a head of us. I had felt them, but there were honestly so many ninja around that I couldn't even react to them all. Now that they'd initiated, I focused; there were five of them in front of us, another two on the rooftops, and one sneaking around behind us.</p><p>This was where the non-standard team sizes put us at a disadvantage. They out-numbered us.</p><p>But well. Quality over quantity.</p><p>"Is that so?" Ino asked dryly. She didn't seem very impressed either.</p><p>I double checked the rest of the street, just to be safe. There were people in the buildings – a café and a gambling house - on either side, but the road itself was clear. For now.</p><p>"Formation," I said quietly. "Bowling Alley."</p><p>Ino gave a small nod, not taking her eyes off the enemy. Chouji stepped forward, until he was standing between the two of us and them.</p><p>And the, sudden as an explosion, Chouji gave a huge roar and expanded, chest inflating and arms contracting until he was round and spinning in the Human Bullet Tank. He rotated slowly, momentum carrying him backwards into us.</p><p>I snapped a tendril of Shadow Stitching Jutsu out, a solid line, towards Ino. She grabbed the end of it, anchored it, and Chouji pushed into it like it was the ribbon at the end of the race. It stretched, elastic, gaining tension until we pulled it short, flinging him down the street at a pace that far outstretched what he could do himself.</p><p>The five were scattered like bowling pins.</p><p>There was a ragged cheer from inside the café. Nice to know the spectacle was appreciated.</p><p>Chouji unrolled in motion, turning from a ball to a boy and skidding to a stop just in time to avoid slamming into the wall. It was a little risky to have our team split like this, but there were benefits to having him suddenly behind them. He turned, hands enlarging to grab them from behind, just in case they felt like retaliating.</p><p>Ino and I leapt up and sideways, in opposite directions, to take out the people on the rooftops. I slapped mine with a quick Striking Bolt, swept his legs out from under him and kicked him off the roof. Then I rounded up the last of them – the one that had been sneaking up behind us – and proved that three Konoha Genin were more than a match for eight Rock Genin when those three were us.</p><p>We tied them up and dumped them against the wall. Someone might help them. Might not.</p><p>"Mind-Body Skim," Ino murmured, hands forming a square seal. She looked a little vacant, and wavered back and forth, but it was clearly a lighter version of the Switch. Then she dropped and briskly went through the pockets of one of the protesting Genin, pulling out their list. "Cheers," she said mockingly.</p><p>Well. That was a way to reduce the competition too.</p><p>"Any answers we don't have?" I asked as we walked away.</p><p>"Nah, they have a different list." She shrugged. "It was worth a try, though."</p><p>"Sure was," I agreed. "And nice job with the new formation, team." It was a little belated, but it had to be said. I was trying to adapt to the way they did things. And they were trying to adapt to me. We were managing.</p><p>We collected a few more answers and blew through another ambush just by dropping a genjutsu on the team and walking away.</p><p>"We could take them out," Chouji offered.</p><p>I shrugged. "If you guys want to. But if they can't shake off a simple genjutsu then those guys aren't going to make it, anyway. We don't really need to and it's better to save our energy for the rest of the Exams."</p><p>We didn't know what the next exam would be, so conserving energy was probably our best bet. We had to remember the bigger picture.</p><p>Later on, when we nearly had the list finished, I squinted at it. "Do you see this?"</p><p>Ino ran her finger over our answers, too. "It's a code," she said. "You think it's like the tenth question?"</p><p>A final trick for everyone. The last twist to test something beyond the obvious.</p><p>"Yeah," I said. I checked the time. "Let's hurry up and get the last answers. We don't know how long it will take."</p><p>We put on an extra burst of seriousness, ignoring all the other teams unless they directly tried to stop us first. By now, we clearly weren't the only ones to have noticed the extra trap, and there was a new level of tension that was beginning to thrum in the air.</p><p>We found the last statue, counted the number of bricks in the base, and started to decrypt the puzzle.</p><p>"Collect the…" Ino said, pulling out a pencil and scribbling substitution on the back of the page.</p><p>"Token," I finished. "Collect the token."</p><p>Fat lot of help that was. What token? From where?</p><p>"I knew it was too easy," she said in resignation. "What kind of intel gathering tells you what to look for?"</p><p>We looked at each other in a kind of mute helplessness.</p><p>I sighed, drumming my fingertips together and staring aimlessly around. We been all over the village today and hadn't seen anything token-like being passed around. Nothing with a name that had 'token' in it. Nothing –</p><p>I trailed off, even inside my own head, and realized I was staring directly at a gambling house. There were an excessive number of them here, for what the place was, except it made sense that when you invited a bunch of rich nobles to visit you a) wanted to entertain them and b) wanted them to spend lots of money.</p><p>"You think?" Ino asked, following my gaze.</p><p>"Won't hurt to try," I said even though I didn't think it would be quite that easy.</p><p>We pushed our way inside, buffeted by the sudden noise. Voices were indistinguishable, but echoed, and the slots were clattering and chiming and there was clanking of money and coins, and alternate cheering and cries of dismay. It was almost overwhelming, especially when you were primed for combat and trying to keep track of everything.</p><p>We edged forward, towards the counter manned by an employee in a vested uniform. There was more than one ninja here, bodyguards of the guests presumably, but I checked them over almost compulsively.</p><p>One of them was familiar.</p><p>I changed course, moving past the counter and deeper into the back of the hall, where it was quieter and there were private booths for games.</p><p>"Idate?" I hissed at the young boy hovering near one of the booths.</p><p>He spun around. "Shikako! What are you doing here?" He didn't look any different to when I'd last seen him, in Land of Tea, though maybe a little more nervous.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "Taking an exam. What are <em> you</em> doing here?"</p><p>"Jirocho-sama was invited to come and see the competition," Idate explained, which didn't necessarily explain why <em> he</em> was there. Wasn't it a bit risky? Then again, no one else would know he was technically a missing nin, would they?</p><p>The game of poker at the table finished up, and then men collected their winnings. Jirocho had a significant pile in front of him, and I wasn't even surprised. He did this for a living, almost.</p><p>"Idate?" He called, then looked up and saw me. "Ah, Shikako! What a pleasant surprise."</p><p>I bowed. "Jirocho-dono. I didn't expect to see you here."</p><p>He chuckled. "Yes, Tsunade promised me a game. That was more than worth coming this way for. And the Exam is very interesting besides. You're participating, aren't you? Then you must be here for this."</p><p>He took a large, silver coin out of his pocket and put it on the table.</p><p>Well. That fit the description of 'token' alright.</p><p>"I am," I said, if not a little cautiously. "I didn't realize you'd have one."</p><p>I glanced backwards, to see Ino and Chouji talking to the vendor at the counter. She looked up and I caught her eye across the room.</p><p>"Oh, a few of us agreed to take a token and help with the Exam. I could just give it to you but..." Jirocho smiled. "Well, since we're here, how about I play you for it." It wasn't a question. "Do you know poker?"</p><p>"Vaguely," I said, uneasily. "I've never played."</p><p>"That's a shame," he said, strangely intense. "Poker is the game of the week, here. You should probably look up the rules." The he smiled. "But for this, we can play something else. What about Hanafuda? I hear you have good combination."</p><p><em> Ino-Shika-Cho</em> . I smiled. "I would be honoured."</p><p>He motioned for the dealer to switch the decks of cards, co-opting the whole table for our exchange. It wasn't like we didn't have an audience, however. Ino and Chouji had joined us, and there were more than a few people interested in what was going on.</p><p>I tried not to let the scrutiny make me too nervous. On the upside, I wasn't actually betting anything. Losing would mean I didn't get the token, sure, but now I knew what they were and that they were given to the watching clients. That was a net gain even before we started playing.</p><p>The thing was. I was a good player, but I wasn't great. And I certainly wasn't someone that gambled for a living. I could have tried to even the playing field by cheating but I had the slight suspicion that anyone that regularly played with Tsunade knew far more about cheating than I did.</p><p>Also, there were ninja watching us. Someone was bound to catch me at it if I tried.</p><p>So I played fair. And the point totals were somehow still close.</p><p>The dealer flipped over the last card.</p><p>Deer. That matched to the maple on the table and I already had the butterfly and the boar… oh hell. I had won off the Ino-Shika-Cho.</p><p>Someone was having a laugh.</p><p>Jirocho chuckled. "Oh, well played," he said, amused, even though I'd had nothing to do with that.</p><p>I had to admit though, it was a hell of a card to win on.</p><p>I sank back in my seat, suddenly aware of how tense my shoulders had become. "Thank you for the game," I demurred.</p><p>"As promised; your token." He pushed it across the table towards me. "I look forward to seeing you in the tournament."</p><p>I stood and bowed politely. "I hope I don't disappoint."</p><p>We wove through the crowd as quickly as we could, escaping back outside.</p><p>"What was that?" Ino asked, once we broke free. "Ditching us at the counter like that, jeeze."</p><p>"Sorry," I said. "I saw someone I knew. Turns out that they gave the tokens to the clients to give to us."</p><p>"Makes sense," Chouji said, pulling out a bag of chips to start snacking on. "If they want us to impress them and all."</p><p>"So you <em> gambled</em> for it?" Ino leveled me a look.</p><p>I gave her a look straight back. "It was his idea! Besides, I didn't exactly stand to lose anything, did I?"</p><p>It wasn't like she was really annoyed, anyway. How could she be? We had what we needed to finish this exam, all nice and neatly wrapped up.</p><p>"Let's go hand it in, then," she said.</p><p>I hesitated. It wasn't a bad idea – get it finished before someone tried to take our token off us, rather than getting their own. But. "Want to find the others and make sure they know?"</p><p>Ino considered it. "Well, we can always rub it in their faces that we got it first," she said, but I knew she thought the same thing I did. They probably wouldn't <em> need</em> the help. But it might make things easier.</p><p>It wouldn't cost us anything, really. And we had to remember that we might have been competing but we were still on the same side. Always.</p><p>It wasn't exactly easy work tracking them down when there were so many ninja moving about here, too and fro. But they weren't trying to hide either, so we managed.</p><p>"Come to ask us for help?" Kiba teased. "I'm sure we could work something out."</p><p>"Hardly," Ino scoffed. "We just came to make sure you didn't fall over at the last question." She inspected her nails. "If you need help, I'm sure we could work something out."</p><p>He made a face at her.</p><p>"The token," Sasuke said quietly, probably so we weren't broadcasting information for every eavesdropper around. "You found it?"</p><p>I nodded. "The clients have them. Or at least, some of them do. We got ours from Jirocho."</p><p>"We coulda worked that out," Kiba protested. "You didn't have to tell us."</p><p>"She's just trying to help, Kiba," Hinata said quietly.</p><p>"I know you <em> could</em> have," I said. "But why do more work than you have to? It's just too troublesome for everyone to have to do the same thing all over again."</p><p>"I see Shijimi-sama," Hinata said, activating her Byakugan and searching through the streets. "Maye she'll have one?"</p><p>That was our Daimyo's wife. Also, the lady that repeatedly hired Konoha shinobi to chase down her demonic cat every time it made a bid for freedom.</p><p>"And… Neji-niisan's team are over there… will you tell them as well?" She asked timidly.</p><p>"We might as well," Ino said. "See you at the finish line!"</p><p>Team Gai was easier to find, if only because it had Lee. Like Team Kurenai, they had worked out the code, but hadn't yet found one for themselves.</p><p>"So we simply must find a noble that possesses a token and convince them to give it to us," Lee said after we'd shared. He nodded to himself. "I shall do so right now!"</p><p>Tenten made a grab for him, but she was too slow. He was gone.</p><p>Neji closed his eyes and looked like he was restraining the urge to sigh.</p><p>"He's very enthusiastic," Ino commented.</p><p>"That's one way to put it," Tenten agreed. "Thanks for the information."</p><p>We started walking in the direction Lee had gone. It was vaguely in the direction we wanted to go, anyway. Surely we would be able to spot someone with a token. Everyone in the village was here for the exams, after all.</p><p>Turned out to be slightly harder than expected. Or harder-than-expected until we saw someone in a Konoha flak jacket that hadn't come with us.</p><p>This really was a week for reunions, wasn't it? It was Raido accompanying Toki and a blue haired woman from the Watari clan. Hokuto.</p><p><em> Awkward.</em></p><p>But she saw me in return, so I couldn't exactly not make contact. "Toki! I'm surprised to see you."</p><p>She smiled. "As a land that has recently started a Hidden Village, it seemed prudent for us to be here."</p><p>It did make sense. "Do you have a team competing?" I asked. I hadn't seen any, but, well, I didn't even know what the village symbol was. If they had one yet.</p><p>"No, we didn't have the time," Toki said. "I think it will be some years before we are able to participate in a Chunin Exam." She stumbled over the words a little uncertainly. "But it is very interesting to watch. "Are your teammates not here? Or your brother?"</p><p>"They're already Chunin," I explained, though I was a little surprised she'd asked about Shikamaru. Then again… being twins had been a part of what helped us connect. It was probably normal for her to ask. "But these are some of the other Konoha ninja participating in the exams." I introduced them all. "Toki is the Daimyo of the Land of Birds. Naruto and I recently had a mission there and worked with her."</p><p>"You were a great help to me," she said quietly. "So I'm glad that I can help you in turn, even with a small thing." She drew a silver coin out of her long, ornate sleeves. "Good luck with your tests!"</p><p>We bowed.</p><p>"That's not even fair," Ino muttered, after we were well and truly out of earshot. "How on earth do you know so many people?"</p><p>I handed the token over to Tenten. She didn't want to take it, so I threw it to Neji instead.</p><p><em> Oops.</em> If Kiba had thought that telling them implied I didn't think they could do it, I didn't want to know what outright acquiring one meant.</p><p>"Interesting missions," I said, looking down. "It just happens."</p><p>It certainly made this test so much easier. We ditched Neji and Tenten to go find their errant team member, and – finally – made our way to the exit.</p><p>"I think that was easier than last exam," I said, as the examiner ticked off the questions on our list, took our token, and proclaimed we had passed.</p><p>"Are you kidding?" Ino countered. "That was way harder. There were so many more parts to it, and we had to run all over the village."</p><p>"It wasn't as tense, though," I said, because Ibiki had really piled on the pressure in a way that this test hadn't managed. Or maybe it was just because we'd gotten so lucky with getting the tokens at the end that we'd missed it.</p><p>We weren't even the first team there, sadly. Both Sand and Mist teams had beaten us, as well as about five or six others.</p><p>We had to stick around until the exam was over, so we claimed a patch of ground and sat. Team Gai arrived before too long, and Team Kurenai took about an hour.</p><p>"She not have one?" I asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Kiba made a low muttering sound that may or may not have been a growl.</p><p>"She brought the demon with her," Sasuke said, glowering. He had scratches on his hands.</p><p>Ino started to laugh. "You had to-" She couldn't continue.</p><p>"We didn't mind," Hinata said, loyally but not really convincingly. "We were happy to help."</p><p>"Well," I couldn't resist one last jab. "At least it was exactly your kind of mission, Kiba."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

This exam would have to knock a hell of a lot of them out if they wanted to have any kind of reasonable number of competitors for the final part.</p><p>That alone amped the tension in the air quite a lot, because I wasn't the only one making that connection. There was a lot of discrete (and not so discrete) sizing up of the competition going on.</p><p>"Each team," the protector continued. "Will be given one playing card. Given the number of teams present, that means there will be five decks in play. Each is of a different colour." She held one up to demonstrate; the back of it was red. "Your objective will be to collect five cards from the same deck and return here by five o'clock."</p><p>That… didn't give us a lot of time.

What's the bet that what cards we pick up ends up mattering?"</p><p>"Your field of battle will be the same as yesterday," the proctor continued. "Also the same is the fact that your clients will be present and watching you. Do ensure they come to no harm. Until three o'clock all eliminated competitors have been asked to remain within the housing units. After that, they are free to access the village if they should so choose."</p><p>Which meant we would then have to distinguish between Genin participating in the exam and Genin <em> not</em> participating. Given that we would be on a very tight schedule, we really wouldn't want to waste time fighting someone only to find out that they didn't even have a card.</p><p>"Oh, and one more thing." The proctor smiled, a quick, knife edged thing that looked very amused. "In order to eliminate unfair advantages, for the Second Exam we have instituted a mandatory team size of four shinobi. Please register your teams with the examination stations when you pick up your cards. Then you will wait until I give the signal to begin and proceed to the village."</p><p>I looked our teams.</p><p>"Well, shit," Kiba said succinctly. "What are we going to do?"</p><p>The other four Konoha teams had already grouped together, redistributing into three four-man teams. But there were nine of us. That didn't make it. One of us would have to-</p><p>I had an idea.</p><p>"Ino, go with Team Gai. Chouji, with Team Kurenai."</p><p>They protested immediately.</p><p>"No," Chouji said loyally. "You shouldn't be the one to forfeit. You deserve to be promoted – you let Shikamaru get promoted last exam. I'll step aside, this time."</p><p>I smiled at him, touched. "Thanks Chouji, but I'm not forfeiting. I saw another team that needs a fourth member. I'll be fine."</p><p>I wove through the crowds until I found them. "Hey. You guys need a hand?"</p><p>Temari relaxed a fraction, releasing the eagle eyed stare she'd had over the crowd, obviously looking for someone. "You'll do," she said as though it were a concession.</p><p>"Draw the short straw, sparky?" Kankurou asked in amusement.</p><p>"I volunteered," I said, even though there hadn't really been much discussion about it. "Since I've worked with you guys the most."</p><p>"Good," Gaara said, which seemed to be the sum total of his opinion. We followed him towards the examination station, to register and pick up a card. The examiner raised an eyebrow at the mixed village grouping, but I doubted we were the only ones who would have to resort to it.</p><p>Just outside the stations, we milled around waiting. Gaara curved his hands together, and sand swirled around in them, forming something that looked like an eyeball before dispersing. An observation jutsu, clearly, which wasn't a bad plan.</p><p>If we could find out what cards people had now, then it would be much easier to hunt down the right ones later on. I was keeping watch too, but there was a limit to what I could see of the stations, and people were being reasonably canny about what cards they were receiving.</p><p>Well, most people.</p><p>In full earshot of all the competitors, Lee jumped up and stood on his teammates shoulders. "We have a green card!" he announced, holding it aloft just so no one could doubt his words. "If you wish to claim it, please come after us!" His teeth gleamed as he smiled.</p><p>Kankurou snorted next to me, crossing his arms. "What an idiot," he muttered. "Is he for real?"</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at him. "How many of the people here actually have a chance of taking it from him?"</p><p>Kankurou, of all people, surely couldn't forget how Lee had fought in the prelims.</p><p>It wasn't, actually, that bad of a plan. Team Gai wasn't designed to set up ambushes, or to track people down, though undoubtedly they could do it in a pinch. What they were designed for was <em> breaking</em> ambushes. They were powerhouses, and they had a great line of defense, especially now when you added in Ino's sensory abilities to be able to identify threats earlier. Having their enemies come to them was basically the easiest way they could do this Exam.</p><p>"Too uncontrollable," Temari said after a brief pause, like she was weighing the pros and cons of the tactic. "There'd be no option of picking and choosing which teams to fight; you'd have to deal with everyone that came after you. It would waste time. And there's no guarantee that enough of the right ones would take the bait."</p><p>I nodded. Those were all fair points.</p><p>More discussion was cut off when the exam proctor signaled for our attention again.</p><p>"The Second Exam," she said. "Starts <em> now."</em></p><p>There was a huge surge as teams broke and raced for the village, either to hide or to set up ambushes. More than one team didn't even bother with that – simply launching themselves at another team here and now. I thought I might have seen one Hidden Grass team sideswipe another – and wasn't that interesting. Intra-village conflict.</p><p>"This way," Gaara rasped, and led us into town with the kind of unerring, unstoppable accuracy of someone that was holding a homing beacon.</p><p>"Did you pick out specific teams?" I asked, because it didn't seem as though we were <em> just</em> going for the nearest red. "Our intelligence suggested that the five card draw is meant to simulate a poker hand."</p><p>"Huh," Kankurou acknowledged, though not actually seeming surprised. "So did ours. Nice to have a second source to confirm it, I guess."</p><p>I guessed it wasn't exactly surprising – if we'd run into someone willing to rig the exams, then they could have too. Especially if theirs had actually been from their Daimyo, who probably had a bit more on the line. It was a little disappointing, though, if I was honest. I didn't have much to offer apart from that information.</p><p>I felt like I was just here for the numbers. Which. Was probably the truth.</p><p>I pushed the thought away. That was far too moody and self-pitying. And possibly arrogant. I would do exactly the same as I always did, which was as much as I could. And if they didn't need it, then that was fine. No problem.</p><p>We paused on a rooftop. I double checked around us, keeping a mental tally of all the people – ninja or civilian – moving about, just in case. It was taxing just because there were <em> so</em> many of them. There were fights breaking out all around, and those fights were attracting audiences.</p><p>Yesterday we'd been cheered on for fighting in the street – today would likely be no different. We'd just have to watch out for people accidentally wandering into the middle of a fight.</p><p>"You two stay up here. Keep watch," Temari ordered, shifting her fan off of her back. She gave Kankurou a heavy, meaningful stare.</p><p><em> What</em> it meant, I wasn't entirely sure, but he grumbled irritably at it and waved her off.</p><p>The cork popped out of Gaara's gourd, the sand snaking out of it and across the rooftop, spilling over the gutters and down the side. I wondered if the targets would even notice it before it was too late.</p><p>The two of them dropped down after it, landing lightly on the ground below.</p><p>We waited. They were back within minutes, a flash of a red card the only declaration of victory that they bothered to make.</p><p>I tried not to think that it was too easy, as we picked up and tracked down our next victims to do it all over again.</p><p>The second team was a group of Cloud ninja, though there weren't any familiar faces amongst them. I thought I had seen Karui earlier, but I couldn't be sure – the trouble with Genin was that they didn't tend to have bingo book pictures to actually remind me of what people looked like.</p><p>The oldest of them managed to do a rather nifty protective shell of lightning – from what I could see from where Kankurou and I cooled our heels in an alleyway nearby – until Temari stepped in and wiped it out with her wind blades. It did mean, though, that the easy ambush turned into an actual fight.</p><p>And while they were distracted, and we were just … standing around, someone tried to take advantage of it.</p><p><em> Incoming</em> , I started to sign to Kankurou, then aborted it when I realized he wouldn't understand. Each village had its own sign language, and though there were the requisite attempts at code breaking and interception that meant it wasn't <em> secure</em> , it also wasn't enough to assume he would know it.</p><p>Instead I lifted three fingers, then pointed in the direction where the majority where sneaking on the roof above us, then one, and pointed down behind us.</p><p>Kankurou raised a hand, paused as he ran into the same difficulty as I had, then beckoned me over towards where Gaara and Temari were fighting.</p><p>I tilted my head. Was he just suggesting that we fall back? Or something else?</p><p><em> God, charades. This is terrible.</em></p><p>There wasn't time to try communicate like this. I primed my shadow, swirled it around my feet and hoped that he understood the motion as a prelude to reverse-ambush.</p><p>He pulled his puppet off of his back, so he must have understood <em> something</em> , and faded out of sight. I thought I could hear the mechanical clacking of moving machinery, but it might have just been my imagination.</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>I waited.</p><p>Then the ninja that I was observing burst forward, dropped off the roof and landed behind me. He grabbed my upper arm, and there was the singing of a blade moving through the air before a knife came to rest at my throat.</p><p><em> Zero points</em> , I decided, having grabbed him with Shadow Possession the moment he hit the ground and controlled every movement after. He hadn't even noticed.</p><p>"Hand over the card,"he said.</p><p>"You really think I have it?" I asked, striving to sound as bored as I could. His three teammates dropped down in front of me.</p><p>They were… well. A little impressive looking. Their headbands said they were from Hidden Swamp, and they had rebreathers slung around their necks even though they wouldn't need them here. One had gloves with wicked spiked knuckles.</p><p>I wouldn't have liked to go three on one in a fight with them.</p><p>But I <em> also</em> had them in Shadow Possession before they hit the ground so that was kind of a moot point.</p><p>"Fine, you're a hostage. Better hope your team will give up their card for you." There was a distinct taunting note in his voice that I disliked intensely. A kind of 'well they might not, and who could blame them'.</p><p>"I have a better idea," I said, keeping the same really-friggin-bored tone of voice. "You give me your card and I let you go."</p><p>There was a beat of disbelief.</p><p>"I think you misunderstand what 'hostage' means," the one behind me growled.</p><p>"I think you're not as observant as you think you are," I shot back.</p><p>His arm flexed against my jutsu, like he was trying to press the knife in closer.</p><p><em> Enough of this, </em> I decided, pulling my own arm forward and away. The knife moved away from my neck.</p><p>"Hey, what-"</p><p>I lowered it down, my hand empty, hovering it over my thigh. "Femoral artery," I said. "I stab here and you bleed out in twenty minutes."</p><p>I let that hang in the air.</p><p>They struggled and came to the dawning realization that they had, in fact, fucked up big time.</p><p>"Card," I suggested.</p><p>The one on the edge looked down. "It's in my pocket," he said, voice soft. "Let me get it, then we'll go."</p><p>I considered him. "Nice try. Kankurou, if you would?"</p><p>Something came forward, but it wasn't Kankurou. It looked like him, sure, but it wasn't. Karasu stepped forward, and peeled open the boy's pocket, not flinching when what unfolded instead was a friggin <em> spike trap</em> that launched out into its face.</p><p>On a human, it would have been horrifying and devastating. On a puppet… well. Karasu's face swiveled an entire one eighty, so it still looked pretty horrifying. Its jointed fingers kept going through pockets, though, until it pulled out a blue backed card.</p><p>"What a waste," it said. "Not even our colour."</p><p>I shrugged. So did the rest of them. "Want to tie them up?" I asked. That probably wouldn't take them out of the exam entirely but it would buy us enough time to get clear and not have to worry about immediate retaliation.</p><p>"Yeah," Karasu said. "I've got locks."</p><p>'Locks' were apparently a version of wooden handcuffs. They came in halves, with each side having a 'z' notch in the end. You lined them up and snapped them together, and then the only way to disengage them was to slide them sideways. Which was complicated by the fact that arms tended to have hands at the end.</p><p>They wouldn't have been unbeatable, but apparently they were easy to produce, especially for puppet masters who just carved them out of wood scraps from their puppets.</p><p>"These are handy," I said, inspecting an extra set. Simple, yet effective.</p><p>"If you get stuck in it I'm not letting you out," Kankurou warned.</p><p>I snickered.</p><p>"Seriously," Temari said, appearing in the mouth of the alley, voice exasperated. "You couldn't stay out of trouble for five minutes? <em> Lookout</em> duty, Kankurou."</p><p>He shrugged. "We looked out. And we saw an ambush. So we dealt with it. Wasn't hardly any trouble."</p><p>The Swamp ninja nearest him snarled something invective.</p><p>Gaara gave him a look that might have actually caused ice to spontaneously combust and go up in flames, not just something as pedestrian as <em> melt.</em> He shut up really damn quickly. "You were… hurt?" he asked, eyes flicking over us both.</p><p>Kankurou rolled his shoulders and grinned. "Nah," he said. "Turns out sparky has some use after all."</p><p>"Hn. Well, I did most of the work there, so I don't know what you're for," I said, levelly.</p><p>It took half a second to register with Kankurou, and he spluttered. "Oi. You. Show some respect. You could have ended up with a spike trap to the face."</p><p>I blinked at him, slowly. "I'd have just made him open it himself," I pointed out. I hadn't, because I'd thought it might be exploding notes – the more easily carried kind of trap. And a ninja <em> might</em> be able to set exploding notes off while still in Shadow Possession, if they had that kind of chakra control. They'd still end up holding them, but some might think it a risk worth taking.</p><p>"That's enough," Gaara decided, and we were off again.</p><p><hr /></p><p>By three o'clock we had all the cards we needed and extras in a variety of colours. The entire time had been a <em> grind</em> of fighting, and you could certainly tell that people were starting to feel it.</p><p>We headed back to the examination station, and started to skirt around the finishing line ambushes that the desperate were setting up.</p><p>"Huh," I said, tilting my head. "I recognize this one." What were the chances we'd run into the same team from Hidden Rain again? First in our exams, then in Land of Tea, and here a third time.</p><p>We could have backtracked and gone around it, we weren't in a rush by any means, but we'd ended up here by going around <em> other</em> ambushes and people were looking impatient.</p><p>Now. What were their names again?</p><p>"Oboro," I said to the silent street. "Mubi. Kagari. We've already fought twice – you can see how this is going to end. Just let us pass."</p><p>Something shimmered, low on the ground, and the form of a boy in a white jumpsuit rose up. He was the one with both eyes uncovered, so Oboro, then. He glared at me. "You killed our sensei."</p><p>"No, I didn't," I said, genuinely startled. "I mean. He was a Konoha missing ninja. I handed him over to the authorities. He's probably still alive."</p><p>That didn't, apparently, make things any better in his eyes. Well, okay. I could see that. I'd even said 'probably'.</p><p>"You aren't going to get away with it," he promised. "You'll pay."</p><p>I smiled benignly, trying to seem calm and reasonable. "Alright, but if you do it here, it's not going to work. You know that, right? Do you remember this team from the last exam? They're certainly not an easier target than mine. Very much the opposite." I let that hang for a second, then continued on. "A much better chance would be the final exam. It is a tournament, after all."</p><p>I wondered if I should add a challenging 'if you think you can make it' to the end of the sentence, but decided against it. I was going for friendly and reasonable not 'try get them to kill me'.</p><p>Pity. I had so much more success with that tactic.</p><p>Temari shifted impatiently, crossing her arms. "If you're going to attack," she said, bluntly. "Get on with it. Otherwise, get out of our way."</p><p>Oboro's eyes dragged across her, flicking over the rest of the team in indecision. It seemed he did remember them, and was smart enough to back off, because he glared at me once more and sank back into the ground.</p><p>I waited a beat, just to see if there was going to be a follow up attack, then said, "huh. I didn't think that would actually work."</p><p>"Can't see why not," Kankurou said dryly, starting to walk. "Very convincing. I don't know why everyone isn't sold on 'you can just kick my ass later'."</p><p>I made a face at his back.</p><p>We weren't the first people back to the field, but since we still had to wait until five o'clock, regardless, it didn't really matter much.</p><p>More interesting was that there were now five poker tables – with coloured felt – set up around the field. Our information was probably right on the mark then, though I noticed some other teams giving them highly uneasy looks.</p><p>By about half past four, it wasn't just ninja teams arriving. Clearly the spectators had been informed that something was about to go down, because there were plenty of them appearing in droves, some picking their way over the grass in impractical shoes, in anticipation of a good show.</p><p>At five o'clock sharp, the Exam proctor stood up and signaled for attention. "The Second Exam concludes now," she said. "No more teams will be accepted. However, there are a limited number of places in the Third Exam, so there will be one final test. You will have noticed that there are five tables set up around the field. Please make your way to the table with the same colour as your cards. The proctors will further explain the rules to you there."</p><p>There were four teams that grouped around the red table with us. None of them ones we had run into over the day, which at least spared a bit of awkwardness.</p><p>"The game," our exam proctor slash card dealer said, shuffling a deck with enough skill and agility that every card was airborne at the same time between his hands. "is standard five card poker. Each team gets four gambling chips, each one representing one person's entry into the Third Exam for the winner of the hand. If you gamble a chip and lose, you do not get it back."</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at us, until we nodded back.</p><p>"For the first round," he went on. "You'll use the cards that you retrieved in the Second Exam. For every round after that, I'll deal from this deck. We'll keep playing until the limit of entrees for the Third Exam has been reached, however long that takes. There are only thirty two spaces in the tournament available, so I don't think it will take that long."</p><p>He grinned, a quick, knife edged thing.</p><p>I did the math. There were five teams at our table. Five tables. Twenty five teams of four a piece. One hundred shinobi competing for thirty two spaces was a rough one in three chance.</p><p>Well. That was the straight math. In reality it was lopsided, because there were those of us who came prepared.</p><p>He doled out four chips to us, the kind of circular stripy things from gambling tables.</p><p>Gaara held our cards and didn't even bother to fan them out. "All in," he rasped and pushed all four buttons further into the table.</p><p>There was a smattering of applause from the audience around us, more grouping over as it became obvious there would be an <em> interesting</em> round. The idea of people walking around and seeing all the cards seemed antithetical – but then, cheating was obviously part and parcel of the game.</p><p>The team next to us – from Nadeshiko Village of all places – looked wide eyed. "We fold," one said hastily, dropping their cards onto the table.</p><p>Two other teams folded, but the last obviously decided we were bluffing. "All in," the leader said, staring daggers at us. Metaphorically.</p><p>The dealer smirked. "Okay, kids. Show the cards."</p><p>They had a high card and two sets of pairs.</p><p>Gaara laid down a royal flush.</p><p>There was more applause this time. The other team slapped the table and cursed.</p><p>"None of that," the dealer said, mildly enough that you <em> had</em> to remember he was here because he was a Chunin at the very least. "You guys are out. Team Gaara – you have four passes to the Third Exam. You can both leave the table."</p><p>We stepped away from the table. There was no one else there that I was invested enough in seeing play, but I did circle around and through the crowd so I could find out what the rest of the group was doing.</p><p>At the green table Tenten was holding the cards with gritted teeth while Lee helpfully and loudly conveyed ridiculously incorrect advice, complete with wild gestures. At her other shoulder, Neji had the tell-tale signs of the Byakugan active. And Ino was leaning against him with a vacant expression that suggested she was not entirely present.</p><p><em> They have that under control</em> , I thought, amused.</p><p>Two tables over, Team Kurenai made the same 'all in' bet we had and even the Mist team conceded to them. But apparently underneath Haku's kind smile lay a card shark – or he was fast enough to cheat unnoticed – because he took the next round for all four places.</p><p>The Hidden Cloud team, with the girl I thought was Karui, also passed in its entirety. The team from Hidden Rock managed three, and Hidden Grass two. Our friends from Hidden Rain also got two of the team into the Finals, so I might <em> actually</em> have to fight them. And there were five single entries from different minor villages.</p><p>"Tomorrow," the exam proctor said. "We will begin the tournament. It will last for the next five days, with one round on each day. The brackets will be posted tomorrow morning. That is all, and the best of luck to you all."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

Her hair was all tangled and frizzing, with her front bang in an impressive sideways cowlick, but she hadn't done more than half-heartedly run a hand through it yet.</p><p>I made early morning disgruntled mouth sounds at her.</p><p>"Yeah," she agreed. "But how would we hide the body?"</p><p>"Nnn," I said, making a vague flopping gesture with my hands that actually translated to nothing but was the most effort I wanted to spare.</p><p>"Very funny," Asuma-sensei said and patronizingly patted us both on the head. "And here I thought you would <em> want</em> to know who you would be fighting."</p><p>Not at five am, I didn't.</p><p>And us, most of the others were just as disgruntled. Neji and Tenten appeared unruffled by the early hour, and Lee was disgustingly cheerful. It shouldn't have been allowed.</p><p>I was, apparently, fighting someone named 'Netsui' from Hidden Cloud. That rang exactly no bells.</p><p>"Huh," I managed, actual words this time. "Thought we would be fighting each other."</p><p>Konoha had more ninja in the final round than any other village. Than any other <em> two</em> villages combined. I'd thought they would pair us all off in the first round to hack down the numbers. But apparently not, because everyone was fairly spread out. There were no intra-village fights in the first round at all.</p><p>That was closer to some vague nominal description of 'fair' than expected.</p><p>Kurenai-sensei nodded. "It was agreed before the Exams even started that no village would fight itself in the first round of the tournament." She smiled. "I rather think some of them might be regretting that now."</p><p>"Oboro," Ino said slowly, reading the name off the poster.</p><p>"Hidden Rain," I supplied, seeking out her name to confirm who she was fighting. "Genjutsu. Ambush type. Some earth jutsu. A nasty thing with oil and fire – might have been a team mate though."</p><p>Sasuke jostled my other shoulder, not looking very happy.</p><p>I found his name and his opponents. Hidden Star. Tumaru. I didn't know what he was worried about.</p><p>"Third round," he supplied, raising his chin at the poster. "You have to face Gaara."</p><p>My eyes snapped back up.</p><p>He was right. If we both won our matches – more 'if' on my part than his – in the third round of the tournament, I'd be facing Gaara. Of the Desert. The Jinchuriki. The Kazekage.</p><p>"Well," I said. That was a full statement all on its own. I frowned at the matches. "Then you have him in the semi-finals."</p><p>Again. 'If'. I had faith in Sasuke but. 'If'.</p><p>"I have to fight Lee," Ino said, joining in the chorus of anticipated despair. "Second round."</p><p>"Urgh," I said. "It's too early for this. I want to go back to sleep."</p><p>I didn't get to. In the end, we migrated to the dining hall for breakfast, which was at least warmer. With coffee.</p><p>The fact was, none of us really knew much about our opponents. Since we weren't fighting each other, it was a lot more intimidating. As much as knocking each other out of the competition would have sucked, we were known quantities. While I wouldn't have rated my chances against some – I knew how to fight everyone at this table.</p><p>"You think," I said slowly, staring down at my drink. "There'll be betting, right? And if there's betting, there has to be some kind of … guide book. So they know what the odds are. And stuff."</p><p>"Oh, yes," Ino breathed. "I knew we kept you for a reason. Hinata!" She leant across the table in the other direction, and had a whispered, hurried conversation. There were a few furtive glances towards us from the few other competitors also awake, but we'd been getting those all the time anyway.</p><p>About ten minutes later, Akamaru had been dispatched and returned with a – slightly soggy – magazine from the betting stand. It was too early for it to be open or for anyone to be placing bets, but the things had all been printed and waiting.</p><p>Kiba stuffed Akamaru, loot and all, down the front of his jacket. "Don't run off," he said, unconvincingly.</p><p>"We better go back to the cabins," Ino said sunnily, standing and stretching. "Lots of preparation to do."</p><p>Chouji looked sadly at his plate. He'd been taking full advantage of the 'eat as much as you can' buffet lines. "But Ino," he started.</p><p>"Chunin Exams, Chouji," she interrupted. "Think about what it would be like if Shikamaru and I were promoted and you had to keep on being a Genin."</p><p>He shrugged, apparently not very moved by it. "It wouldn't matter," he said. "There's nothing wrong with being a Genin."</p><p>"And if they broke up the team because of it?" she challenged. "It's Ino-Shika-Chou together, so you better not!"</p><p>"It's not going to happen!" Chouji said, clenching a fist and holding it up. "We'll always be a team!"</p><p>Though he did swipe one last muffin from the table before he stood. So I guessed Chouji knew his priorities.</p><p>Back at the cabin, we all piled into one under the amused gazes of our sensei and spread our spoils out on the floor, carefully unpicking the staples so we could take the pages apart.</p><p>We checked out ourselves first, obviously. Partly in narcissism – I wasn't denying it – but also mostly to see how accurate and detailed the information was.</p><p>"It must be from our registration folders," Tenten said. It wasn't much, nothing terribly detailed, but there were specifics like age, height, weight, graduation year, and number of missions that couldn't have simply been deduced.</p><p>"Konoha likely had to supply candidate information for the exam," Neji agreed with her.</p><p>Everyone politely said nothing when we flipped to my page and its ridiculous mission scores. And the tiny note of excessive hospitalization time. Thanks so much, Tsunade.</p><p>"So who are we fighting?" I asked, trying to hustle it along, when the 'politely saying nothing' extended into a meaningful silence.</p><p>It was kinda fun, going over the information in a large group. We passed pages around, waved them under peoples noses when there was something interesting that just had to be shared, bounced ideas off each other about that this-or-that really meant.</p><p>By the time Asuma-sensei came and got us at half past eight, we were a lot more amped for the fighting.</p><p>We were taken outside the village. There wasn't so much an 'arena' as much as 'a large flat grassland with stadium seating along one side'. Well, they were playing to their strengths, weren't they?</p><p>It didn't really give us a lot to work with in terms of environment for the fighting. That would put me at a disadvantage if I wanted to use Shadow Jutsu.</p><p>"Welcome to the Final Exam," the proctor told us. "As you can see, this will be the arena for the final matches. For the first round, we have thirty two competitors and sixteen fights so in order to complete them all today we will be running two matches at a time. To accommodate this, you will see that the arena has been divided in half. For this round, all fighting must take place within the designated ring – any competitor that sets foot outside this space will be disqualified. Each match will have a thirty minute time limit, and each match will start on the hour or half hour. Delays will not be tolerated. If you are late, you forfeit, it's as simple as that."</p><p>It would be an eight hour day then and starting at nine meant we would finish at five. Which left the evenings free for the dining and entertainment portion of the festival. It made sense.</p><p>"If you are in the first set of brackets, your matches will take place on the left field. If you are in the second set of brackets, they will be on the right. When you are not required on the field you are free to leave the arena, or to stay and watch the fighting in the competitors section."</p><p>The competitors area was where we were dismissed to in short order, up the back of the stadium. It had a good view of the proceedings anyway, so it wasn't too bad. We took over nearly an entire side of the section, and the Hidden Cloud and Hidden Rock teams gave us dirty looks.</p><p>People poured into the stadium and started to fill it up. There were individual boxes for the more important people – the Kage, for one, were all together, and I wondered if that was a <em> smart</em> decision – and Grass Chunin helping usher people in or moving through the crowds handing out booklets or refreshments.</p><p>There were opening speeches, but I tuned most of it out. It wasn't any new information, just greetings and an attempt to buzz the crowd.</p><p>The first two rounds were Gaara vs Tamashii – the girl from the Nadeshiko Village – and Temari vs Omoi, so at least the thing kicked off with a bang.</p><p>Tamashii was good, if nervous, but she fought with a chakram that channeled wind chakra. It sliced and diced, seemed to be controllable even after she threw it and when she was put on the defensive she managed to fill it out with chakra and turn it into a decent shield. But the outcome of the fight was almost a given from the start, and no one was really surprised when Gaara managed to immobilize her and the match was awarded to him.</p><p>"It was a good match," she said, after he had released her from the sand. "But if you ever visit Nadeshiko we will have a real match according to the rules of my village." And she bent slightly to press a kiss to his cheek, before sashaying away.</p><p>The crowd applauded again, a few hollering and cat-calling, because you kind of had to admire that. It was almost ninja sweet, even if you didn't know about Nadeshiko proposal rites.</p><p>On the other field, Temari was facing Omoi with the kind of ferocity that we all expected from her. She had a distinct type advantage – wind to lightning – and his sword meant that he needed a much closer range than she did.</p><p>It was not an easy match, by any means, and there were some serious techniques being thrown around. But in the end, she smirked up at the crowd when the match was awarded to her.</p><p>And it seemed like Hidden Grass had thought of everything, because in between matches there was entertainment. A marching band took to the field, filling in the time before the next match, so that things proceeded to schedule but no one got bored.</p><p>For the second fight, Karui – and it was her – fought the guy from Hidden Rock. But on the other field, Neji was facing off against one of the twins from Hidden Mist, Yoro.</p><p>That was where all my attention was focused. Not only because it was the first of Konoha's matches, but because the scenario looked awfully familiar. It wasn't that I thought Neji would deliberately hurt her. Against Hinata it had been personal. But it didn't stop the feeling that this could go badly.</p><p>And yeah, okay. It would look pretty bad if Konoha was remembered for beating on little girls. Not great for our image.</p><p>"Please do your best," Neji said, sounding a little stilted. "But it would likely be an intelligent move for you to yield."</p><p>"I'm going to fight," Yoro declared, raising her chin. She held up her fists, stomping into a fighting stance. "Just you watch."</p><p>She leapt forward when the referee signaled a start, leading with two straight kicks, and counting off specific numbers along the combination. It wasn't until the last one was thrown on 'shi' that I got the joke.</p><p>"Ni-san-go-ro-shi," I repeated with amusement. 2,3,5,6 and 4, technically. But it was also a pun meaning 'kill your brother'. "They're all going to be puns, aren't they?"</p><p>"Cute," Ino said. "Fits with how they introduced themselves."</p><p>Neji mostly defended, but very gently just … shut her down. At least the Gentle Fist didn't <em> look</em> violent, even when she was struggling to stay on her feet.</p><p>"I… surrender," she said.</p><p>We applauded. And when she got back to the competitors section, spine straight and head held high, we made a point of telling her she had done well. It was no lie, even if she was out classed.</p><p>And Haku just drew her very gently aside and wrapped her in a hug.</p><p>Then Ino had to go and fight Oboro – who seemed to feel cheated that he wasn't fighting me. Well it wasn't like I had anything to do with the match ups. I hadn't <em> promised</em> anything.</p><p>A ninja that preferred genjutsu and ambush was at a bit of a disadvantage when you had to start the fight six feet away in plain sight and wait for a referee to give the go ahead.</p><p>"Begin!"</p><p>Ino sprang forward, launching herself at him with kunai in her hands. It was pretty textbook taijutsu, but it started Oboro off on the back foot. He retreated and retreated until he had enough space to start a jutsu, and then a multitude of clones started rising out of the ground.</p><p>Not Earth Clones, they were too wispy. What had they used last time? Haze Clones.</p><p>They were genjutsu, wouldn't be able to do any damage, only now the entire arena was filled with bodies, and Ino would have a hard time picking out the real one. He could attack from anywhere, giving him the advantage.</p><p>"Summoning: Storm of Mirages!" She touched her fingers down on the ground, palm arched upwards so that there was room for something small to be summoned beneath it. There was no glimpse of it, though, because the air started to waver and distort, until there were wavy, shimmering reflections of Ino all over the place.</p><p>Now they were both hidden.</p><p>But. Ino was a sensor. 'Hidden' was a subjective measure.</p><p>Four kunai with trailing explosive notes flew out of the mirage – from different directions, even, impressive – to land in a square around a particular patch of ground. When they went up, they threw dust and dirt into the air, along with the tumbling body of a Genin.</p><p>Oboro hit the ground and rolled, glancing warily around at the mirages. He deflected the first volley of kunai thrown at him, and bolted for the side of the field. When he got there, he pulled a water canteen from his belt and flicked the cap off.</p><p>"Water Release; Black Rain Jutsu!"</p><p>Mist boiled out of the canteen, spilling into the air and forming a misty black cloud. It hovered forward, and started to rain. The rain was black – clearly it wasn't water in his canteen.</p><p>Then he flicked an exploding note forward. A kunai appeared out of the mirage to try and deflect it, but the oil caught fire and spread until the whole ring was burning.</p><p>I could sense Ino's chakra flare in a summons, then vanish. I didn't panic. She was fine. She was smart. She knew what she was doing.</p><p>The fire burnt itself out. The mirage had vanished; the arena was empty.</p><p>Then a hunk of sooty dirt shifted, near his left foot, a gapping maw - literally, teeth and tongue and all - opened, and Ino ascended up out of her summons mouth from where it was burrowed underground.</p><p>"Summoning; Hidden Tongue Hands!" Whip like tongues shot out of her sleeves, wrapping around him and binding.</p><p>Her hands came together in an odd, square seal. "Mind-Body KO!"</p><p>Oboro jerked violently, like a seizure. Then he slumped, eyes rolling back into his head.</p><p>The referee came over.</p><p>Ino released him, letting him slump to the ground, and stepped back.</p><p>"And the victor is Hidden Leaf's INO YAMANAKA!"</p><p>We cheered.</p><p>Ino gave a wave to the crowd that disguised how tired she looked. She had pulled out three summoning jutsu and a clan jutsu. That had to have taken a lot out of her. But she was smiling and happy and had done so, so well.</p><p>I glanced over at the other field, but it was well and truly quiet and empty.</p><p>"Anyone catch the other fight?" I asked, a little chagrined. If all went well, I'd have to fight the winner next round, and I'd missed it completely.</p><p>"It was very short," Hinata said softly. "The Grass ninja won it." She frowned faintly. "I think it was some kind of paralyzing genjutsu? His opponent passed out very quickly."</p><p>Muku, of Hidden Grass, had pretty fantastic odds on him according to the betting book. He was one of the favourites for the whole tournament. I was smart enough to admit that had me a little worried about facing him.</p><p>But my match was up next, so I had to go down to the field. Lee and I both headed down together, and I high fived Ino as I passed her in the hallway, but hurried along. I didn't want to be late.</p><p>I was kind of excited. Hah. I was excited. Saying 'kind of' was disingenuous. Nervous, yeah, but only in an anticipatory way. I felt ready. I felt prepared.</p><p>Even though we'd been watching fights here all morning, it was a different experience to be standing in the middle of the field, under the gaze of the whole stadium. The space felt bigger, more expansive. There seemed to be more people watching. The noon sunlight was high and bright, beaming down on us. I catalogued the shadows, of which there weren't many, aware of their placements just in case.</p><p>Netsui was tall and dark skinned and built like a wrestler. She had a katana at her waist and layered metal forearm protectors.</p><p>"Kunoichi like you make me sick," she said, voice a low growl.</p><p>I blinked, startled. "Excuse me?"</p><p>There was a glint of trump in her eyes. She'd wanted to take me off guard, and she'd done it.</p><p>"You heard me," she said, a chin lift punctuating the statement. "You come to an exam like this and you spend the entire time hiding behind the men." She scowled. "We all saw you in the dining hall. And then you got carried through the second exam. Well you're out of luck here; it's just you and me now. There's no one here to protect you."</p><p>"Right," I said, uncertainly. In the dining hall? Hiding? Did she mean when we'd <em> held Chouji back?</em> Or was she assigning alternative motives to <em> making friends?</em></p><p>I was a little lost. Which only made me feel annoyed, because we hadn't even started fighting and she was winning. This was trash talk, plain and simple, and it was working.</p><p>My annoyance bubbled higher.</p><p>Netsui gave a satisfied little smirk. "Kunoichi who depend on others to do everything for them shouldn't be allowed. It's so … weak."</p><p><em> I</em> , I thought, <em> would show her 'weak'.</em></p><p>And she was wrong, besides. Depending on others never made you weak. Friendships never made you weak.</p><p>Teamwork <em> never made you weak. </em></p><p>I breathed in. Breathed out. Transmuted annoyance into the cold flash of actual anger and tucked it away. Shifted my feet into a ready stance and nodded politely to the referee.</p><p>The referee dropped his hand. "Go!"</p><p>Netsui clicked her sword free of its scabbard with her thumb and lunged forward. She brought the blade high, swept it up and around in an arc to come down in a beheading strike. She was fast, and it might have been a problem.</p><p>I palmed a kunai. Brought it up to block. Beneath our feet, the shadows of our blades crossed before the real things did.</p><p>She slowed down.</p><p>The blades connected with the softest of 'tnk's.</p><p>Confusion blinked across her face, clearly visible this close. She tried to pull back, but found she couldn't move.</p><p>"I'm sorry," I said, smiling thinly. "You seem to be laboring under some misapprehensions. Since you had all morning to find out about the person you were fighting, I didn't think it was necessary. But since it is, please, allow me to introduce myself. I am Shikako of the Nara Clan of Konoha. You are currently in my Shadow Possession Jutsu. If you have any means of escaping it, I'd suggest that you employ them now."</p><p>"What? I-" The struggles against my jutsu were weak, especially at this proximity, compared to what I knew I could hold.</p><p>I waited a beat. "No? Pity. Allow me to demonstrate what you should have done." I cleared my throat, made sure my voice carried. "Your name is Netsui Sato. You are fifteen years old, one point six two meters tall and seventy five kilograms. You graduated Hidden Cloud Academy at twelve years old, in the upper quartile of your class. You've done one B-rank mission, nineteen C-rank missions and thirty three D-rank missions."</p><p>And that was all information straight out of the betting book, though judging by the way her face paled, it really did sound quite impressive that I could reel it off like that.</p><p>"Your regular sensei is T, but you were picked to be team mates for Killer B's students for this exam, since you made it to the end of Hidden Rock Exam but broke your arm at the end of the second exam and couldn't compete in the tournament."</p><p>That tidbit I'd actually overheard from them. They'd been discussing it earlier in the morning; how this was the furtherest she had been in the exams and why. Of <em> course</em> we'd been listening in. And I obviously knew that that Karui and Omoi were Killer B's students. That wasn't even hard.</p><p>"And finally," I said. "That is a <em> very</em> interesting sword you have. Family heirloom, by any chance?"</p><p>Her face went tight. "Fuck you."</p><p>"Mm," I said. <em> Jackpot.</em> I'd found a nerve to stomp on, just as hard as she'd stomped on mine. "The marking on the blade… that's the symbol of the Naganori clan, from the Land of Lakes. Did you know? There's an interesting story there. One that's fairly well known even. The forty seven ronin."</p><p>"Shut up!" She barked.</p><p>"Oh, you have heard of it?" I asked innocently. "It was a while ago, before the founding of the ninja villages, back when there were still a lot of samurai around. See, the story goes, Daimyo Naganori assaulted Daimyo Yoshinaka and had to commit seppuku. By the laws of the time, his samurai were supposed to commit seppuku alongside him. Instead they fled. Like cowards. Is that your heritage?"</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at her, condescending.</p><p>The real end of the story was that the samurai had gone back later and avenged him, killing the other Daimyo and then dying. Undoubtedly the blade had been passed along the family, and the descendants had wound up settling in Hidden Cloud and become ninja instead of samurai. But just as obviously the story and dishonor hadn't been forgotten. That was the way of this world, where things like that lingered as though a dark cloud.</p><p>"Maybe I should help you along," I suggested and started to move. I dropped the hand holding the kunai down, rotating it around, until the point of the blade was towards my stomach.</p><p>Caught in the Shadow Possession Jutsu, Netsui did the same. The tip of the blade of her katana just barely brushed against her skin.</p><p>There was real fear in her eyes now, not just annoyance and irritation.</p><p>"Unless there's something you want to say?" I offered, calmly, pleasantly. "To the referee, maybe."</p><p>He wasn't far away; close enough to interfere. I wondered if he would, should I follow through. I wondered if there were medics around that could heal her afterwards.</p><p>She gritted her teeth and glared at me.</p><p>I let that thought transmute into chakra. Into killing intent.</p><p><em> What if I killed you?</em></p><p>"I- I surrender," she spat out, stumbling over the words. "Stop. Just. I surrender."</p><p>The referee was between us. It would have done nothing to stop me – only let me control him as well – but I took it as the signal it was and broke my jutsu.</p><p>I stepped back.</p><p>"Thank you for the match," I said, bowing politely and never taking my eyes off of her.</p><p>She stormed off the field. The referee called the match, but there was only a smattering of lukewarm applause. Most people were watching the other fight, it seemed.</p><p>I slunk my way back up to the competitors section. Chouji was apparently in full stress eating mode already, and had drawn others into it in the guise of it being lunch time. Someone – and I suspected Tenten – had produced a picnic blanket, camp table and kettle full of hot tea with mugs.</p><p>I skirted around them, joining Sasuke where he was leaning against the front railing as he watched Lee's match in progress.</p><p>"Was that really necessary?" he asked, eyes flicking towards me.</p><p>I gave a half-hearted smirk to his Sharingan but couldn't muster up anything beyond the annoyance and anger of the aborted fight. It lingered, like an itch under my skin. "There is an ancient Nara Clan saying that encapsulates this situation," I said gravely. "<em> Talk shit, get hit</em> ."</p><p>"It is not," Sasuke said automatically. He was getting too good at calling my bullshit. "What's wrong?"</p><p>"Ino got to set the whole arena on fire," I groused, which was only half the issue and the heart of the matter all at once.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. "Don't complain because it was easy. You'll get disowned."</p><p>I elbowed him, sliding in next to him so I could watch Lee's match too. He was fighting Shiku – the other Mist twin – which was bad luck on her part.</p><p>"But really," Sasuke continued, disapproving. "A monologue? Were you <em> trying</em> to let her break free and attack?"</p><p>I studiously didn't reply.</p><p>He sighed. "Really? Well. There's always next round."</p><p>Down below, Lee cheered his opponent on. "A most excellent attack!" he cried, as not a single blow landed. I had the feeling that he genuinely meant every one of his encouragements, however they might have sounded. "So passionate! Please continue to attack with such youthful vigour!"</p><p>Poor little Shiku braced her hands against her thighs and panted heavily, clearly exhausted. But after a second, she dragged them high again.</p><p>"3! 7!" she wheezed, as she flew into another combo. I wondered if the puns were mnemonics to help remember them, as much as they were names of attacks. "5! 6! 4!"</p><p>Mi-na-go-ro-shi, I translated. Kill them all.</p><p>And she was such a cheerful little child too.</p><p>Lee kept encouraging her right up until the time limit, by which time she was so exhausted she could no longer stand. It was certainly one way to win.</p><p>And then he gave her a piggyback ride away from the arena, because he was Lee.</p><p>The next match was where things really started to get interesting. On one field, Kiba was facing off against the kunoichi from Hidden Rock, but on the other… Hinata had drawn Kankurou.</p><p>She looked half way terrified and halfway determined.</p><p>It did not go entirely as expected. The Byakugan was clearly an amazing counter for most of his puppeteering abilities. Hiding? Out of the question. Surprise attacks? Not a chance. Multiple opponents? Not an issue.</p><p>And she could see and cut chakra strings, which left him at a really big disadvantage when she started in on the attack.</p><p>Not just cut them. Hinata grabbed one and surged her chakra through it like an overload. And it worked. Kankurou cursed and yanked his hand away, injured or at least numb.</p><p>The gas canister felt like it was a last ditch tactic. And though it slowed her down, it did pretty much nothing to stop the <em> fist of chakra</em> she ploughed into Karasu and sent pieces scattering across the field.</p><p>Hinata coughed.</p><p>I waited with bated breath.</p><p>She wobbled. Then she gathered another fist of chakra and blazed across the field – straight for Kankurou.</p><p>His mouth formed words that were too quiet to hear but might well have been 'oh shit'.</p><p>Hinata collided like a train crash – pure and devastating force.</p><p>Smoke and dust billowed out, momentarily obscuring the outcome. When it cleared, Hinata knelt in the center of it, barely holding herself up.</p><p>And Kankurou.</p><p>Kankurou had been thrown clear out of the ring.</p><p>Ino gave a scream of pure and disbelieving joy. "HINATA!"</p><p>We thundered into applause, no less enthusiastic. I cast a glance at Temari and Gaara, to see how they were reacting. Temari caught my eye and raised one shoulder in an indifferent shrug. She clapped, lazily.</p><p>Gaara had no reaction. Well. It could have been worse.</p><p>Hinata wobbled once more and very slowly collapsed forward onto the ground. Two medics rushed out from the sidelines with a stretcher and bundled her onto it.</p><p>Kankurou stood, brushed himself off and collected the scattered pieces of his puppet with a flick of chakra strings, then strolled after them.</p><p>Neji pushed himself off the railing and strode towards the exit, clearly intending to make his way down to the infirmary.</p><p>"I'll come with you," Tenten said, scrambling to her feet.</p><p>"You still have your fight," he reminded her, barely even pausing.</p><p>I cast one last glance down below. On the other field, Kiba was fighting what appeared to be giant hornets. Go figure. She must have been from the Kamizuru Clan. He and Akamaru were well set with their Tunneling Fang moves, though the bees seemed to secrete some kind of sticky substance to try an pin them down.</p><p>So in other words, pretty much the same tactics that Kidomaru had used against us.</p><p>"I'll go," I said. "Good luck with your fight, Chouji. If I'm not back, Ino can cheer you on for me. Oh, and I have daifuku if you win."</p><p>His eyes lit up. I wasn't above bribery. I was <em> prepared</em> for bribery. A good ninja was always prepared.</p><p>I ducked out the exit and hurried after Neji, but still heard Ino's follow up. "Stop thinking with your stomach!"</p><p>The infirmary just a set of tents set up discretely behind the stadium. When we ducked through the entrance flap, Hinata had been transferred to a bed and was being looked over. Kankurou lounged nearby, turning a piece of broken puppet over in his hands.</p><p>"She's fine," he said, with a one shouldered shrug. "It was just some knockout gas. Even if I hadn't given them the antidote, she'd sleep it off in a couple of hours." He nodded. "I was more worried she'd touched Karasu – but it doesn't look like she got any of it on her."</p><p>And in that move, Kankurou rocketed up about a million points in my estimation.</p><p>It wasn't that I didn't like him. It was just that, compared to the bluntness of his brother and sister, Kankurou was so much harder to pin down. He was a puppet master, and all that meant. You never quite knew what you were seeing, there.</p><p>But these weren't actions you did for someone that was just an opponent. He'd followed her. Provided the antidote and checked that – in destroying his equipment – she hadn't hurt herself worse. And then, even after that, he'd stayed so she wasn't alone.</p><p>Neji moved closer, taking up position near the foot of the bed like a guardian statue.</p><p>"Thank you," I said, quietly. "How's Karasu?"</p><p>"Wrecked," Kankurou said glumly. "It's going to take days to fix him. That was embarrassing."</p><p>"It was a good fight," I offered, because there wasn't much to say to that.</p><p>He huffed. "No, it wasn't. Chiyo-baasama is going to kill me." He actually looked pretty bummed about it all.</p><p>I felt a twinge of sympathy. Not enough to feel sorry that Hinata had won – it had been amazing – but enough. "Chiyo?" I prompted. "She's the stand-in Kazekage, right?"</p><p>He flipped the piece of wood over again, running a thumb over the jagged edge. "Yeah, that's right. She doesn't want the position, though, and you've heard what Gaara's plans are. Somehow he convinced her to come back and take over the Puppet Corps again. I'm not sure I'd thank him for that."</p><p>"Why not?" I asked.</p><p>He smirked. "She's as batty as she is dangerous. I've been learning a lot, but it's been an experience."</p><p>I could certainly understand that.</p><p>Kurenai-sensei interrupted our conversation by ducking into the medical tent. She looked mildly surprised to see us, but didn't stop to talk. Instead she went to check in with the medical ninja.</p><p>It was still a little reassuring to have one of our Jounin here, I had to admit.</p><p>By the time Hinata was awake and the medics were willing to let her go, we'd missed two sets of matches but would just make it back in time for the last. Which were the ones I was really looking forward to, because Sasuke was on one field and Haku was on the other.</p><p>"I can walk," Hinata mumbled and slid off the bed. And kept sliding, until she was kneeling on the floor.</p><p>I knelt down next to her. "Fair enough. But it would be faster if we helped you, wouldn't it?"</p><p>I could absolutely understand not wanting to look weak or injured in a competition like this. I would probably have protested exactly the same way. It didn't mean, however, that I still didn't want to help her.</p><p>Hinata tried to get to her feet. Even when I slid under her arm and helped hold her up, it was not a particular success.</p><p>"You don't want to stay here longer?" I confirmed. I doubted it. No one really wanted to stay in hospitals, ever. It was a rule.</p><p>She shook her head into my shoulder.</p><p>I looked at Neji. He twitched forward, then pulled back again. Right. No help there.</p><p>"Okay," I said, wondering how we were going to manage. I could Shadow Jutsu, but I wasn't sure that would actually be very good for her. "Princess carry for the conquering princess," I decided. I ducked down, swooped her legs over one arm and picked her up.</p><p>It was a hold that ninja didn't particularly like to use. It blocked my hands, was unbalancing and would put us both at a disadvantage if we were suddenly attacked. There was a reason that most ninja went with the piggyback, even when carrying kids around the village.</p><p>But I didn't actually want to drop her, and it was miles and miles easier than trying to get her to stay on my back.</p><p>"Oh, but you-" she murmured and made a sleepy gesture with her hand. Other than that, she didn't appear particularly perturbed. I'd call it a win.</p><p>"Relax," I said. "It'll be fine. Neji's here looking out for you. And I've been informed I have a habit of hiding behind the menfolk."</p><p>Hinata just looked confused. Neji made the most dismissive sound I had ever heard. I recalled, very abruptly, that Neji had most likely seen my first kills in the Forest of Death, or at the very least the immediate aftermath. And had, for days afterwards, considered me a threat.</p><p>I grinned at him. The joke was funnier when people were in on it.</p><p>Hinata was welcomed back with a hero's applause. I set her down on the picnic blanket, and she was very swiftly given tea and food, and surrounded defensively in all directions. (If I sent a smile towards the Hidden Cloud group, well, it was only mildly out of spite.)</p><p>"You win?" I asked Kiba, nudging him with my shoulder.</p><p>"Why," he complained. "Is it always bugs? Shino's going to kill me. And Akamaru has honey all through his fur."</p><p>Akamaru seemed pretty happy with the situation, if the amount of licking that was going on was any indication. But I could see how that would be a downside.</p><p>Didn't stop me from laughing at his misery. But I could see.</p><p>"So did Tenten. And Chouji," Ino said. "I guess you better cough up the goods."</p><p>Obligingly, I located my bag and rummaged around until I found the right storage scroll. I didn't want to get them mixed up, at this point. The daifuku were just a store-brought box of twenty, in their own little individual plastic wrappers. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing, when dealing with paranoid ninja. "Here, Chouji. Congrats. Sorry I missed it."</p><p>"Next round," he said. "It's me and Kiba."</p><p>Kiba grinned. "That'll be fun."</p><p>Chouji must have been in a good mood after his match, because he even passed out the sweets to everyone after unsealing them, even the Mist and Sand teams. Friendship, Akimichi style.</p><p>Sasuke was fighting the boy from Hidden Star village, who had some very interesting chakra. His method of attack was <em> almost</em> like Naruto's Jinchuriki cloak, in that it was solidified chakra that enveloped him for attack and defense. It didn't look like he could move while he was using it, because he stayed stationary and merely used tendrils of it as lancing attacks.</p><p>That was an obvious weakness that Sasuke exploited.</p><p>On the other field, Haku was fighting the girl from Hidden Grass – Ryuuzetsu. She had white hair and eyes that <em> almost</em> looked like Rinnegan. I'd had to do a double take when I'd seen her. Her specialty seemed to be fire ninjutsu, and while that initially seemed like a good matchup against Haku's ice style, it was unfortunately not the case.</p><p>He created one mirror to block the surprisingly large fire blast, ducked through it and out another one behind her, and barraged her with senbon.</p><p>As far as the provided information in the betting book was concerned, Haku was something of a dark horse. There was just so little information on him, mostly because the usual measures of academy scores didn't apply and that he hadn't <em> technically</em> been a Mist ninja for very long.</p><p>Still, there was a lot of interest in his first match, and he put on a good showing, forcing Ryuuzetsu to surrender before too long.</p><p>And with that, the first round was over.</p><p>I really hoped tomorrow would go better.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

Every good deed that's nobly done will always repay the cost</em> . ~ <em> Anonymous.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Welcome to Round Two of the Hidden Grass Chunin Exams!"</p><p>Round Two kicked off with Gaara vs Karui, so of course it started with a bang. There was only one fight at a time today, since there were only half as many matches, and so the match was given the whole arena.</p><p>Karui was good. There was no doubt about that. But she was a kenjutsu fighter, and therefore in the unenviable position of having to try and take on a Jinchuriki with a sword. Or having to try and take on an AOE ninjutsu user with a sword, if that was a better description. Things weren't in her favour from the very start.</p><p>Even using lightning jutsu didn't help much, because Gaara was able to create lightning rods by – I assumed – changing the particulate make up of his sand. Clever. Then again, he'd had practice fighting lightning users during the Gelel Invasion, if I remembered rightly.</p><p>Though there were some interesting moments to the fight, I doubted I was the only one totally unsurprised when Gaara won.</p><p>The next fight was Temari vs Neji, which was more interesting to me because it wasn't a total given who would win.</p><p>Temari opened the scene with some wide sweeping wind blasts and kept her distance. She even pulled out that 'flying on her fan' trick that I remembered from the last exams.</p><p>Neji, conversely, reminded us that he was fast and could dodge and deflect with the best of them. And, oh yeah, his Jyuuken now came equipped with distance attacks. That was a serious improvement.</p><p>I could see Temari reassess the situation as she touched back down on the ground. "Wind Release," she growled. "Great Task of the Dragon."</p><p>The sky went dark and wind howled and she dropped a tornado straight down on Neji. It rattled us, even up in the stands, lashing twists of cold air pulling at my clothes and hair, stinging my skin. It was probably worse, the further down you were. Probably horrific, right in the middle.</p><p>Neji did what he could and spun into Kaiten.</p><p>I tracked his chakra, so I wasn't surprised when the wind cleared and he was no longer there.</p><p>Temari did the obvious and checked <em> down.</em> It was the logical place to escape an attack from the air.</p><p>So naturally, Neji dropped down on her from above, having gone airborne off some combination of Kaiten and her attack. It was almost a fair imitation of the Tunneling Fang, really, though no doubt both clans would be annoyed if I made the comparison.</p><p>Temari swung her Tessen shut, using the cold steel as a last ditch weapon to keep him at distance. But she was well within the range of his divination now.</p><p>"You're up next," Ino whispered to me. As if I could forget.</p><p>"Wish me luck," I said. But I was feeling pretty confident. If this guy was a genjutsu user, then I was in no trouble, no matter how good his odds.</p><p>Muku was a Grass shinobi, and a few years older than me. He had dark hair, held back in a ponytail, and pale, aristocratic features. I didn't recall seeing him at our Chunin Exams, even though there had been Hidden Grass there. Either he hadn't been ready, they'd wanted to hold him back for this exam to fight on his home ground, or there had been other reasons for not sending him.</p><p>Impossible to determine without more information.</p><p>I bowed to him, because it was polite. He bowed back, the same kind of shallow, don't-take-your-eyes-off-your-opponent move.</p><p>"Go," said the referee.</p><p>I lead with a Shadow Jutsu going straight for him, because it was easy and obvious and exactly what I'd used in the last fight. A feint. An opening move.</p><p>Muku raced through a set of hand seals but let it connect.</p><p>I had a second of <em> crushing </em> disappointment. This fight was just going to be the same as the last.</p><p>Muku finished his handseals and let it connect and-</p><p>Oh. That was not genjutsu. That was not genjutsu at all. Hinata had been wrong.</p><p>"Sealing Style: Fire Release," Muku commanded, triumphant, "One Person Prison!"</p><p>The seals slithered down my shadow, they wrapped around my chest and arms like burning iron bands. They were like a living thing, tracking my chakra back to its source and strangling it.</p><p>My jutsu cut out.</p><p>All my chakra cut out. It was there, still, but I couldn't touch it, like my veins were made of glass. I reached and I pulled and nothing came.</p><p>I trembled, muscles loose but mind suddenly, gloriously sharp.</p><p>I had no chakra. I had no chakra and I was in the middle of a fight.</p><p>Well, then.</p><p>I dropped to one knee, folding over and planting my palms on the ground, watching Muku from beneath the cover of my bangs. <em> Some kind of paralyzing genjutsu</em> , Hinata had said. <em> His opponent passed out. </em> She had seen and deduced and had been wrong about why, but nevertheless it told me how it looked. How a person would react, normally, to being so suddenly cut off from their chakra.</p><p>"You-" I rasped, with a loud and obvious inhale. Like distress. Like bait.</p><p>Muku stepped closer, confident in his jutsu, confident I was no longer a threat. "Still awake? You should surrender then. You won't be able to use chakra until I release the seal. There's nothing you can do."</p><p>He stopped. I judged the distance.</p><p>It would have to do.</p><p>I exploded off the ground, hands pivoting and leg lashing out in a sweep kick. He was off guard, clearly, not expecting anything from me and certainly not an attack.</p><p>I kept going, using the momentum to keep moving, my other leg following around to slam a back kick into his face, hands pushing against the ground for more force.</p><p>He tumbled away, but regained himself, rolling to his feet.</p><p>Shit. Element of surprise gone.</p><p>I whirled kunai out of my pouch, a set thrown at him and a pair in my hands. I chased him, but he was ready this time, not off guard, not surprised. He blocked the opening blow, twisted inside my guard and locked down around my arm.</p><p>I twisted back, tried to pull away but was too slow.</p><p>There was a snap.</p><p>A snap and white, blinding pain.</p><p>Pain and no chakra to muffle it. A choked sound died in my throat. My kunai tumbled from my fingers.</p><p>He hesitated, grip loosening for a second, clearly not having intended actual injury. No chakra didn't just mean I wasn't as strong or fast – it meant I also wasn't as resilient. That move hadn't been intended to damage.</p><p>I reversed the grip I had on the other kunai, swinging an awkward backhand strike into him. He blocked that too, changing his stance and throwing me off over his hip. It was a gentle move, comparatively, disengaging more than attacking.</p><p>I hit the ground – pain – and rolled – more pain – to hand and knees. My arm was broken, I didn't doubt it. My hand was nearly numb. It would be close to useless.</p><p>So taijutsu wasn't working. I needed something else. Another method. Another avenue of attack. Something to distract him, at the very least.</p><p>Damn. If I could use seals –</p><p>But why not? I couldn't activate them, because I couldn't use chakra. But I still had blood. And blood was still a conductor of chakra, regardless of whether I could use it or not right now.</p><p>I dropped my head down, like my arm had given way, creating a tiny space beneath myself where I could work, if I worked fast.</p><p>I pulled a pair of exploding tags from my pouch, haphazardly dropping them beneath me, and nicked a thumb on my kunai. The blood I used to make a trigger seal on them, a spiral to gather chakra from the air, until it reached a certain limit and would set off whatever it was attached to.</p><p>Then I bent my wrist and smeared the blood along my forearm, disrupting the lines of the resistance seals that I could no longer dismiss. They had safety systems built into them, overrides, and simply vanished when they could no longer function.</p><p>I felt lighter. Freer. Still no chakra, but it was another trick, another step up that he wouldn't be expecting.</p><p>I raised my head.</p><p>"Are you prepared to surrender?" Muku said, standing further back now. He was wary, but not wary enough.</p><p>I smiled, teeth flashing. My blood was burning in my veins, heat and glass. "No."</p><p>And once more, I pushed off the ground, scooping up my tags as I went, blurring across the grass faster than before.</p><p>He was ready, this time, but I was counting on that, feinting and pulling back, a kick he moved to avoid, a punch that sailed harmlessly through the air. Tags that I slapped onto his shirt and then pulled free, retreating to a safer distance.</p><p>They didn't go off. Shit. That was the problem with inventing seals on the fly. I had a <em> theoretical estimate</em> of how long it would take to reach the activation limit, but it was <em> theoretical.</em></p><p>He plucked them off and threw them aside. They fluttered, slowly, in the wind. "Exploding tags? You can't even-"</p><p>They went off. First one, then the other in a chain reaction. Not quite at ground zero, but close enough.</p><p><em> Three second margin of error. That's terrible.</em></p><p>I launched into the smoke. Muku was staggering, not undamaged now either. I slammed a foot into his stomach, tried to follow it up with a knee to the chin, going straight for the brutal, frontal assault.</p><p>He recovered, grabbing at my leg, hooking an arm around my ankle so it never landed. I used it, pushing myself off my pinned foot and forward, onto him, hooking them together around him and trapping his arms to his sides.</p><p>He threw himself to the ground, weight bearing down and crushing me. We twisted and grabbled. I tried to stab him with a kunai, barely breathing through the pain jostling through my broken arm. He got a hand free, caught mine with it.</p><p>Stalemate.</p><p>We rolled across the ground. He threw his head back, nearly head-butting me in the nose. I barely avoided it, head low and pressed against his.</p><p>I wasn't going to last. Couldn't keep this up. He'd recover and I wouldn't. My window of opportunity was closing, burning up like a magnesium flare.</p><p>I had to do something.</p><p>Something soft smacked me in the face, my own hair flapping around as we wrestled, braid a liability in close quarters combat. It was looped forward, around him.</p><p>I wasn't thinking. Only reacting. There was no time to consider actions, only to do them. I bit it, grabbing it in my teeth and leaning back.</p><p>I wasn't the type of person that braided ninja wire or makiboshi into my hair, in case someone grabbed it. In normal circumstances, if someone was that close, they were surrendering themselves to my shadow jutsu. But it was still rope like, still strong, still anchored firmly to my head. In the right conditions, still dangerous.</p><p>It pulled tight across his throat.</p><p>Now we were in a different game. Instead of him trying to keep my hand away, I was keeping his, straining and burning to keep it extended instead of retaliating. My legs were locked tight around his chest. I was no longer just an annoyance – I was a <em> danger.</em></p><p>He went still.</p><p>I wasn't fooled. His chakra gave him away. I held on, pulling back further. The base of my skull throbbed, hair not meant to be used this way.</p><p>When it became clear the ruse wasn't working, he struggled again. But I was so close now. So goddamn close. I wasn't going to lose. And he was weakening. He couldn't breathe. He would be panicking. It wouldn't be long now.</p><p>It wasn't.</p><p>He went limp again, this time for real. His chakra jolted and went passive. The seals faded off my skin, burning away, and my chakra was mine again.</p><p>I let go. Rolled off of him. Staggered to my feet. I pulled medical chakra to my working hand, pressed it to my broken arm and numbed the area. <em> Oblique compound fracture of the humerus</em> . It had pierced the skin during the fight, blood leaking down my arm. The surrounding tissue was swelling and irritated, but it didn't seem like the radial nerve was damaged. That was good.</p><p>The referee came over, cautiously. Knelt next to Muku. Nodded.</p><p>"The winner is Shikako Nara," he proclaimed.</p><p>There was some confused, scattered applause. There were some sounds that weren't-</p><p>I shook my head. Oh. They were booing. Right.</p><p>A set of medics came onto the field with a stretcher, and took Muku away. I followed them, almost blankly. They checked him over first, which was fair enough because I'd gone after his throat and that could be much more life threatening. Given the method I'd used, even I couldn't be sure whether he'd passed out from lack of air or from compression of the blood vessels in the neck.</p><p>I waited for them to finish with him and while I was waiting Sasuke and Neji turned up. Which was an odd pair and totally unexpected but made a little sense because Neji had already fought and Sasuke wasn't on till much later. Who knew how long this would take.</p><p>"Ino wanted to come and yell at you," Sasuke said, confirming it. "But she's on against Lee next."</p><p>I gave a one shouldered shrug. "It's fine. You didn't have to come."</p><p>"Of course we did," Neji said, smoothly. "The Hokage's orders were that no one was to be alone, remember?"</p><p>I could hardly argue with that, could I?</p><p>"Yes they were," Tsunade-sama said, ducking into the tent and making the other medics squawk with a combination of indignation and awe. I could sympathize with the feeling. "I'm glad someone was paying attention."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei ducked in after her, and I gave him a smile because my hands were too occupied to wave. He eye-smiled back at me. "Your grappling is terrible," he informed me. "We need to work on that."</p><p>"Not really my usual focus," I agreed and let Tsunade push me up onto an examination bed.</p><p>She examined me with chakra, then basically rolled her eyes. She flicked a finger over the stitching at the shoulder of my jacket and it fell apart so that the entire arm slid off.</p><p>"Shikako!" Sasuke protested, sounding a cross between annoyed and completely exasperated. "You can't just stand around and have a conversation while your arm bone is sticking out! You have to say something!"</p><p>I glanced down at it and felt vaguely queasy. Like, yes, my jutsu had told me what was going on, but seeing it was another matter.</p><p>"It's called a humerus," I said because really. 'Arm bone'. And then I really couldn't resist. "But I don't suppose it's that funny."</p><p>As puns went, it was weak. But Sasuke did look like he was inches away from smacking <em> someone</em> in the face so… success?</p><p>Tsunade snapped a few orders to the medics, fully expecting to be obeyed and a few of them scrambled over, to see her in action. Or to see what people were yelling about. One of them blanched but another wheeled over a cart of supplies, so I supposed they weren't all just gawking.</p><p>She manipulated the area with chakra, sliding the bone back beneath the skin where it belonged and sealing it all up. The area was numb and I couldn't feel a thing, and I was perfectly happy with that situation.</p><p>"Normally I'd tell you to rest it for a weak on light duty," she said dryly, making me lift and raise it, checking the range of motion and then wrapping a bandage firmly around the place that had been injured, even if there was no longer anything more than a faint mark left. "But somehow I don't think that's a possibility. Just try not to break it again."</p><p>"I'll try my best," I agreed, thankful she wasn't going to try enforce the usual. Because 'light duty' and 'fight Gaara' didn't exactly coincide. And I didn't want to forfeit. I'd been… okay no. I hadn't been worried. If no one here had healed it I could have done it myself. But being done by Tsunade was much better than anything I could have done myself, so that was good.</p><p>She huffed. "Do try," she said. "But you did a good job out there. The civilians might not have been impressed, but the ninja stood up and took notice."</p><p>I tilted my head in confusion, casting a glance at sensei.</p><p>He looked up from his book, seeming amused. "There are Jounin in the crowd that wouldn't have wanted to fight that match," he said. "The Kantokusha Clan are the ones that run the Blood Prison – their jutsu is primarily used to restrain serious shinobi criminals."</p><p>"Makes sense," I said, because chakra restriction sealing was really useful for prisons. It figured that the best prison would have the best chakra restriction. If I had known that ahead of time… but I hadn't. Because his clan name hadn't been <em> in</em> the betting book. Neither of the Grass ninja had had surnames, and I hadn't even given it a thought.</p><p>"Some people were quite confused about how you managed to avoid the seal," Kakashi-sensei continued, slyly, like he was sharing a joke with me.</p><p>I stared at him blankly. "Avoid it?" I echoed slowly. "But I … didn't avoid it?" It sounded like a trick question. "I didn't have any chakra and I didn't use any jutsu?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei nodded. Obviously he'd known that. He'd just as obviously wanted me to say it. Neither Sasuke or Neji looked surprised. They both would have been able to tell that too. Maybe it was for the benefit of the medical ninja? Did they think I had avoided it? Or were they supposed to spread the information that I hadn't avoided it?</p><p>I gave up.</p><p>"Thank you, Tsunade-sama." I jumped off the bed, gathering my discarded sleeve. "Okay, let's go watch Ino and Lee."</p><p>I walked back into the competitors section and was immediately besieged. Kiba wrapped an arm around my shoulder and tucked me into his side. "With your <em> hair,</em> " he crowed. "I can't believe it. I'm going to tell everyone."</p><p><em> Oh no</em> . "Everyone is here," I tried. "You don't need to mention it ever again."</p><p>His grin was not kind. "Oh, no," he said, steering me until I was wedged up against Chouji. They were doing to me what we had done to Hinata yesterday – tucking me safely and defensively in the middle of the group, like a penguin huddle to keep out the cold. "This is never, ever being forgotten."</p><p>"It worked," I grumbled quietly. He was far too gleeful. I didn't like it on principle.</p><p>"That's why it's amazing," Kiba said. "And why I'm going to tell this story for the rest of your life. Also, did you know Hana once ripped out a guy's throat with her teeth?"</p><p>"That's… impressive," I settled on.</p><p>Down below, Ino and Lee faced each other in the middle of the arena. As one, they lifted a hand with two fingers extended. The seal of confrontation. Whether they'd discussed it previously, or whether it was just <em> habit</em> , it was a nice gesture.</p><p>"I am looking forward to this fight!" Lee said brightly. "Please do your very best, Ino-san."</p><p>Ino started the fight with genjutsu, because she was too smart to ever try and face Lee with taijutsu. But genjutsu was of most use when you didn't realize it was there, and much less when someone saw you casting it.</p><p>He broke the first layer easily, was distracted by the second layer for long enough for Ino to set up other traps, but broke that before too long.</p><p>Ino was heavily on the evasive for this fight because it did her exactly no good for Lee to be able to attack her. Once that happened, it would be pretty much over. So she was avoiding it with as much cunning as she could.</p><p>Of course, Lee made no easy target.</p><p>"Stand still and let me hit you!" Ino's voice shouted out from the corner of the field, as Lee easily blocked a set of thrown shuriken. After training with Tenten, that was hardly going to be a challenge for him.</p><p>He went for the place her voice had come from, narrowly avoided the trap set to force him out of the ring, narrowly avoided the back-up trap that was supposed to immobilize him, avoided the third trap after that, and sprung back to safer ground.</p><p>"A well thought-out attack, Ino-san!" he congratulated. "I almost fell for it!"</p><p>It went back and forth a little while longer. In the end, I wasn't sure if Ino made a mistake, if Lee had finally been able to locate her, or if something else had happened entirely.</p><p>He closed his eyes, breathed deeply and centered himself, then launched himself across the field. The first two attacks caught nothing, but the third hit.</p><p>The Hiding with Camouflage Technique that Ino was using shattered and broke.</p><p>Lee ducked low, swept her legs out and kicked her into the air.</p><p>I winced.</p><p>She rolled to her feet outside the ring and shook her head ruefully. But she still came back and linked hands with him in the Seal of Reconciliation to the applause of the crowd.</p><p>The fight after that was Kiba versus Chouji. And for once, even Chouji seemed excited to get down on the field. It had nothing on the way that Kiba was bouncing in place, but still. They too formed the seal and waited for the referee to call the start of the match.</p><p>"Super Multi-size Jutsu!" Chouji roared, planting his feet steady on the ground and <em> growing.</em> He grew and grew until his head was as tall as the stadium itself, so that we could look out and see eye to eye.</p><p>We cheered for him, whooping and waving.</p><p>"Inuzuka style," Kiba shouted in turn, throwing a soldier pill to Akamaru. "Human Beast Combination Transformation; Double-Headed Wolf!"</p><p>It was a fight of giants. They might not have been seriously trying to kill each other – Kiba most certainly didn't use the Fang Wolf Fang – but every impact made the earth quake and rattle. Every growl and snarl sounded six times as mean.</p><p>Subtle? Not particularly. Impressive? Oh yes.</p><p>Kiba walked away from that one the winner, likely because he had the aggression to want to win that no amount of bribery could match. But undoubtedly that fight would go down as one of the most memorable of the exam.</p><p>I was more worried about Hinata's fight against the Cloud Genin. There had been a simmering tension between our groups the whole time, and I most certainly had not helped it with my match. Not even a little bit. The opposite of 'helped it' you might say.</p><p>And the fact that, at this point, Akantai was the last of the Cloud shinobi to still be in the exam. Omoi had lost to Temari. Karui had lost to Gaara. Netsui had lost to me. That was bound to be a motivating factor for him to want to win this match.</p><p>They glared at us. We glared at them. Battle lines were drawn in the sand.</p><p>"Kick his ass, Hinata," Ino advised, voice low. "Kick his ass <em> hard."</em></p><p>And Hinata took to the field. Hinata faced off against a ninja wearing the symbol that had had such an effect on her life. He probably knew nothing off it, had probably never been involved in anything like that, but that attack had not been a one off. Hidden Cloud's habit of 'acquiring' new blood limits was not unknown.</p><p>"HI-NA-TA!" Kiba hollered, breaking her name down into the syllables of a chant. "HI. NA. TA."</p><p>Ino's voice joined in, and Lee and Chouji. I gave it the stomp-stomp-clap backing of Queen and it took off. There was no sporting crowd in the world that didn't like a good chant.</p><p><em> You got blood on your face, you big disgrace, waving your banner all over the place. </em></p><p>Down below, Hinata ducked and dodged and wove, hands lighting blue fire into the air. Her Protection of the Eight Trigrams was a delicate defense and her attack was brutal. I loved the contrast.</p><p>Her opponent didn't go down easy, but he went down. She stood over him, blazing with fierceness and chakra and looked deeply, deeply satisfied.</p><p>"That's a hard act to follow," I said to Sasuke, nudging him with my shoulder.</p><p>He gave me an offended look. "You don't think I can do it?"</p><p>I regarded him with as much faux seriousness as I could. "I don't know, Chojuro looks pretty mean."</p><p>"Go <em> away.</em> " He pushed off the rail, turning away. "Start panicking about fighting Gaara or something."</p><p>I made a face at his back because he might just have got the last word in there.</p><p>His fight with Chojuro was good. Chojuro had the Hiramekarei which was incredibly recognizable as one of Hidden Mists Legendary Seven Swords. It looked massive and out of place in the hands of a Genin, but there was no denying he was skilled with it. Maybe not legendary, but the seeds of it were well and truly there.</p><p>It seemed Haku wasn't the only dark horse that Mei had managed to dig up for this exam.</p><p>Sasuke wisely kept his distance, and fought back with a stunning arsenal of ninjutsu – some of which I didn't even realize he knew. The speed at which he could cast them, switch between styles and use them to twist the battle to his liking I was familiar with, but it was perhaps even more impressive from the outside when I didn't have to worry about plotting my own response.</p><p>He won. But it was perhaps not as clear cut a victory as he might have liked.</p><p>The last fight of the day was Tenten vs Haku, which was a very different sort of fight. Haku might have been fast but I was willing to bet Tenten used Lee as target practice because she had a preternatural ability to hit what she aimed at no matter how fast he was going. His own ice senbon were shot out of the air with impunity, and Tenten kept producing more and more weapons from pockets that could clearly not have held them.</p><p><em> Hammerspace!</em> She had to have finished the seal.</p><p>It was also a fight of two people who didn't particularly want to actually hurt each other. It was … interesting. Tenten had such potential to be lethal, with her weapons and precision and it was mostly put to use in <em> avoiding</em> damage. If she could shoot his senbon out of the air, she could surely have hit him too. And there were so many vulnerable spots on the human body. That she never took advantage of them meant that Haku could bring up ice mirrors to block her in and trap her.</p><p>There was something important here, and I tucked that thought away to deal with later. Maybe we'd been trying to help Tenten the wrong way – suggesting ways to be more and more lethal. Maybe what she needed was a way to be <em> less.</em></p><p>She resigned with good grace in the end, though it took another ten minutes after the end of the fight to pick up all the discarded weaponry.</p><p>"You guys go to dinner without me, I want to check out the field," I said. Sasuke was mostly right. <em> Now</em> was the time to start panicking about my match.</p><p>"We'll come with you," Ino volunteered. "Won't we, Chouji?"</p><p>"But dinner," Chouji protested, then subsided. "Yes, Ino. It won't take long, though, will it?"</p><p>"Not long," I agreed. "You won't miss anything."</p><p>We broke away and headed down to the field, quiet and empty now.</p><p>"What do you need?" Ino asked. She was one of the people that wasn't totally unfamiliar with how I worked, the kind of things that went into seals in the first place.</p><p>I considered. "Can you find out how big the field actually is? Exact dimensions." I dropped my bag on the ground and rummaged through until I found a tape – I'd brought so much stuff with me 'just in case' but it seemed like it would turn out useful after all. I had an idea how big the arena was, and I would err to the side of caution and go smaller, but exact was always better.</p><p>I took a sample of dirt, shoved it in a plastic jar and stowed it away. Then I sat down, closed my eyes, pressed my hands flat against the ground and started channeling chakra into it until I could <em> feel </em> it all. Soil types, the density, where it was packed hard or loose or where the foundations of the stadium were. If there were pipes or wires running beneath our feet. If there were springs or rocks or animal burrows or other hazards less obvious. All that information was necessary.</p><p>There was a reason seals didn't travel well. What worked in one place wouldn't work in another, even perhaps the next field over. They were specialized, an exact tool for an exact effect and couldn't be repurposed for anything else.</p><p>By the time I'd done that – and written it down so it was useful – Chouji was about ready to pick me up and carry me off to dinner.</p><p>"Okay, okay," I said, reaching for my bag only to find it swiped out of my reach.</p><p>He put his other hand on my shoulder and hustled me towards the dining hall. "You have a big fight tomorrow!" he said. "So you should eat up tonight. That way you'll have plenty of energy!"</p><p>"Sure," I said agreeably, jotting down a few more ideas and letting him direct me. Then I got a little bit distracted and by the time I was paying attention again, I was sitting at the table with a plate piled high with food in front of me.</p><p>I blinked at it.</p><p>I looked at Ino. She snickered. "You just kept saying 'sure' so Chouji made a plate for you."</p><p>I poked it with my chopsticks and shrugged. Well then. Okay. "Oh, that reminds me. Tenten! I can't believe you finished the seal and didn't tell me."</p><p>She looked startled, because I'd interrupted her conversation with Lee. "It's not finished," she laughed, realizing what I was talking about. "I just figured there was no better time to try and use it. Not that it did much good," she finished, a tad rueful. "I can catch you up on it, though?"</p><p>I hovered in indecision. But ultimately… it wouldn't help right now. "When we get back home?" I amended.</p><p>I ate, and I scribbled and when everyone else was done they tugged me along after them, still working on my notebook.</p><p>I dropped down outside the cabins and asked Tenten if I could borrow her little camp table that we'd been picnicking off. It made a good set up for a worktable, and even though it was getting dark there were outside lights to work by.</p><p>"Are you going to be out here long?" Ino asked, settling down beside me. She seemed pensive, but not upset or distressed.</p><p>I hummed. "Probably," I admitted. An all-nighter before a big match wasn't great, but I could manage it. The pay-off was worth it. "It might take me all night to make what I need. But don't worry, the Jounin have a watch set up. I'm not going to be alone."</p><p>Then I spread out my ink and paper and went to work.</p><p>Sometime later I raised my head. It was colder, darker and Asuma was smoking a cigarette somewhere nearby because I could smell the smoke. But there was also familiar chakra circling cautiously out of our perimeter. It wasn't approaching, wasn't trying to cross or attack, but it was there all the same.</p><p>I looked up and waved to Gaara.</p><p>He came closer. It was almost timid except he was too intense to ever be timid. Wary, maybe. "Shouldn't you be asleep?" He rasped, curiously.</p><p>I nearly shot the statement back, before I remembered that he didn't sleep. Oops. "Nah. Uh. You aren't keeping watch for your team?"</p><p>"They sleep better when I'm not there," he said.</p><p>Foot, meet mouth, apparently. I winced. "Right," I said, and hurried on to an explanation like that would take the awkwardness away. "Uh, I'm preparing for tomorrows fight. I mean. I have some stuff, already. But. Since I have time I thought I would make some specific seals…" I trailed off. This was not a success. "Uh. Do you want to know what they are?"</p><p>He crouched down on the other side of the table, which at least meant I wasn't staring up at him, but looked at me like he wasn't quite sure I was… okay. I was clearly making a great impression. "We are fighting tomorrow," he rasped.</p><p>"Yes," I agreed, because that was a statement. "I'm looking forward to it." I tried a smile, to see if that would lighten the mood a bit.</p><p>"Why would you tell me what your weapons are?" He asked bluntly.</p><p>Oh. So <em> that</em> was the problem. The bluntness was a little startling, but really. So useful. I could answer that.</p><p>I leant back, onto my hands. "The thing is," I said, calmer now. "I'm not going to win. I know I'm not going to win. But that's fine. I don't actually <em> need</em> to win, you know? I don't really want to, either, if I'm honest. You have so much more riding on this exam than I do. I mean, I don't want to have to do <em> another</em> one but it wouldn't be the end of the world. You want to be Kazekage, so you <em> do</em> have to win. That's why you're here, right?"</p><p>Otherwise, they'd have just promoted him themselves, from Genin to Kazekage. That was what I had always assumed went down. But he was here to present Sand, to show what he was and what he could do.</p><p>"But we can both get what we want out of it, if we fight well," I went on. "If I put up a good fight, show what I can do, then I can be promoted even if I lose. And if I fight well, then you can fight well and show them what <em> you</em> can do, and you get to go on to be Kazekage. Win / win situation for everyone, right?"</p><p>He stared at me for a long moment. It was honestly really unnerving. I tried to meet it, but I was never going to win a staring contest with him.</p><p>"No," he said.</p><p>I opened my mouth to try and sell my point further. I just had to hit the right points.</p><p>"Don't tell me what your plans are," he continued before I could. "I must be able to fight those that come for me when I am Kazekage. If I cannot do it here, then I am not enough."</p><p>He looked frustrated, trying to articulate it, but I could see his point.</p><p>I nodded. "Okay. That's fair." I gave an awkward cough. "I'm, uh, going to continue though. I have a lot to do?"</p><p>He nodded but didn't move. I wondered if it would be rude to go back to working and ignore him while he was <em> right there.</em></p><p>"Wait here," he said, just as I decided to pick up my brush once more.</p><p>He left. I shrugged, because I wasn't going anywhere. I went back to ruling a table onto a scroll – I thought that if I managed to link the individual cells to a master seal, then I could probably get a dispersion effect by cutting them up into tiny scraps of paper. The Cherry Blossom Blizzard Explosion that Sakura had once suggested but we'd never found reason nor method to make reality.</p><p>Gaara came back while I was ripping the pieces up and stuffing them into little fabric pouches. He paused, clearly decided not to ask, and set a cup of tea down on the table.</p><p>"Oh," I said, not having expected that. "Thank you?"</p><p>He nodded, gravely. Then handed me a plain manila folder. I took it, confused.</p><p>I opened it. "Oh." It was a copy of Sasori's ninja file. Classified intelligence. I didn't know what kind of information Tsunade could get from Hidden Sand, legally or illegally, but this was unmistakable. There was barely anything blacked out. Shit. This was worth more than its weight in gold.</p><p>"Oh," I repeated softly, looking up at Gaara. Something, something hard and twisted in my chest eased a fraction. He'd heard me. He'd understood. He was warned and prepared and. And. He had handed it back to me.</p><p>Someone else was doing something.</p><p>I wasn't alone.</p><p>I swallowed, clutching the file. There was a lump in my throat. I hoped I wasn't going to cry.</p><p>"You warned me," Gaara said slowly. "So I wanted to help you back. This is… This has nothing to do with our fight tomorrow. Whether I win or lose, I want you to have this. To help Naruto."</p><p>"I will," I said. "It will. I'll look after it."</p><p>I yanked my sleeve up, drew a storage seal in ink on my arm and sealed the folder within it. It was safe there. The safest.</p><p>"<em> Thank you.</em> "</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Grass Chunin Exam Arc - 3rd: Chapter 95</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Links still aren't working, but all the fanart can either be found on my deviantart (Silver-Queen), on the tumblr (dosbysilverqueen) or on the DOS Chapter Guide site. Don't forget the Forum, either, if you want to discuss things.</p><p>There have been a whole spate of sidestories/AU's written around DOS lately, so make sure to check those out! I've been collecting them in the Heliocentric Community which you can find on my profile. For everyone that's been asking for Shikamaru POV, there's Komorebei, which is excellent. And Dandelion Dreams has alternate POV of the Muku fight last chapter.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 95</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot, will be victorious. ~ Sun Tzu</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Do you think you made enough exploding notes?" Kakashi-sensei asked seriously. "You might only be able to level a very small country."</p><p>"They're not all exploding notes," I grumbled at him half-heartedly. And even if they were, it was because they were <em> useful,</em> all jokes about how much I liked explosions aside<em> .</em> They were a good tool, functional and versatile. Simple, easy to use, required little chakra and dangerous. Bang-for-buck they were better than almost anything else I could do, which was why I ended up using them so often.</p><p>Okay, if you couldn't make them then they were expensive. But I could, so that didn't even matter. I could use them as frivolously as I liked.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei patted me on the shoulder, awkwardly. "Maybe I should have taught you Chidori."</p><p>I huffed a laugh. "Thanks, sensei. I'll leave that to Sasuke, though."</p><p>I stood and stretched. The sun was dawning now and I'd been hunched over a small table all night. Even with tea it had been a long night and I was tired. Happy with the seals I'd made, but tired.</p><p>I circulated some chakra to wash the worst of it away, packed up all my stuff into ways that would be easy to access during the fight. The largest seal was in a thick and heavy meter wide scroll, the kind you had to carry slung across your back, and I had many more slung around my waist in a kind of bandoleer.</p><p>I ran through some morning exercises while I waited for the rest of the group to wake up and stumble outside, refreshing myself, testing my range of motion and double checking that my arm had no noticeable weaknesses.</p><p>Well, preparation time was over. I was as good as I was going to get.</p><p>I barely picked at breakfast, knowing I should eat yet not able to force much past the nerves twisting my stomach.</p><p>"You know," Ino said, hesitantly confiding to me in a low voice. "No one will say anything if you forfeit, right? You don't have to do this."</p><p>I gave her a weak smile. It didn't seem to reassure her any, so I pulled it together. "Yeah, I do. It's important."</p><p>"I know he seems better," she said. "But do you really want to get in the ring with him? You remember what happened in Konoha."</p><p>She was actually worried. I could see that. But… "That's <em> why</em> it's important," I said. "Not for me. For him. For everyone else. It's not going to go badly, okay? I have plans."</p><p>"This isn't something that explosives can solve," she said, though this time it sounded resigned.</p><p>I grinned, cockily. The opening was too good. No wonder everyone kept giving me shit about them, because I could never pass up the chance to say things like this. "If explosives don't solve your problems, then you aren't using enough."</p><p>And actually, the conversation had helped. Not that Ino doubted me, but that I'd had to say it, to verbalize and argue that I wanted to do this. I was locked in now; I was going to do this. No backing out.</p><p>The only way out, as they said, was through.</p><p>At least we were the first match, so I didn't have to <em> wait</em> for it. I took my place on the field across from Gaara.</p><p>"Let's have a good match," I suggested.</p><p>Gaara nodded, completely inscrutable. It was more than a little intimidating from this side of it.</p><p>My heart beat was picking up, a rapid thud-thud-thud echoing in my ears. I swallowed. <em> Why had I thought this was a good idea again? </em></p><p>"Match," said the referee. "Start!"</p><p>Well first. First I needed to level the playing field.</p><p><em> Go big or go home.</em></p><p>I swung the giant scroll off my back and planted the end on the ground. "Sealing Style," I commanded, pouring my chakra into it. "Earth Style: City of Pillars!"</p><p>The seal poured forth from the point where the scroll touched the ground, a rapidly expanding circle with us at the center, complex glowing on the ground.</p><p>Gaara took one look at it, eyes going alarmingly wide, and wrapped himself in a cocoon of sand before retreated to the very edges of it. Smart move.</p><p>Then the ground burst forth, earth shaking and heaving. Chiseled columns of it rose up, stone compressed together until it jutted out of the ground and towered into the sky, shaking dirt clods off like rain.</p><p>One, rising directly beneath my feet, bore me into the sky and out of range of retaliation.</p><p>As a technique, it was not so different from the ones I knew how to do – Earth Wall and Earth Spike. It was only a matter of <em> scale.</em></p><p>This was something I could never have done with ninjutsu. I didn't have the chakra, I didn't have the control, and I didn't have the concentration. The cost was too high. But fuinjutsu was different – you paid in time and knowledge instead. That made it less useful in battle where you so rarely had <em> time,</em> but sometimes. Sometimes it was perfect.</p><p>I had redesigned the battle field. Turned it from a flat plain into a near forest, a three dimensional playground with hiding spots and obstacles and shadows. Turned it to my advantage, and disrupted whatever plans my opponent may have formed.</p><p>I breathed in. I could do this.</p><p>The second step was the follow up. Gaara had not-quite cocooned himself, a half shell of sand rising around him for defense – open enough to see but closed enough it would react to any threat in any direction.</p><p>I leapt, pillar to pillar, drawing an arc in the sky, throwing down kunai with trailing pouches. They hit the sand with no discernable impact, the flimsy fabric breaking apart, raining paper confetti into the air and getting tangled with his sand.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>I touched down, next pillar over. The surface was flat and nicely formed, as easy to stand on as flat ground. My seal had done well.</p><p>Gaara's sand flicked, returning the kunai in an arc up to me. I let what would miss miss and knocked aside what wouldn't. They didn't matter, really. Their purpose was done.</p><p>Sand whipped up after it, curling lines of it weaving through the air towards me. I threw some kunai and pouches at them too, jumping off and evading, leading it on a chase through my pillar forest. I was light on my feet and fast – resistance seals gone and chakra enhanced to the fullest of my ability. I used ninja wire for fast escapes, tarzaning around in wide arcs – without the hollering, obviously – and left tightropes of it strung up all of the place as I went. My feet left black ink marks of Touch Blast seals where I stepped, and all the while, I was throwing kunai and scattering paper confetti into his sand.</p><p>'Forest' wasn't a bad simile. I was used to them, to operating in a three dimensional environment, working with or around things that were in my way, and I was using that to my advantage. He wasn't bad, though. He knew enough to keep me moving away, not letting me approach closer or get the drop on him, and forced me to keep moving at high speeds. If it was a game of stamina, I would lose. I would lose <em> fast</em> if I had to keep up high level enhancements.</p><p>I set down and sand wrapped around the base of the pillar I had landed on. Gaara raised his hand, fingers loosely gripped and twisted.</p><p>My foundation went sideways. I pushed off, moving from the top to the side and rode it down to ground. It hit with a thundering crash, but it had fallen cleanly, away from the stadium and hadn't even knocked against the others on the way down.</p><p>Now was as good a time as any.</p><p>Gaara stared at me from across the field. His hand still up, still loosely gripped. The sand slithered under the pillar, circling me, ready to catch me.</p><p>"The paper?" I said, loud enough to be heard. "Exploding notes. Think fast." It was in his sand. Which meant it was around him, in his shield. Maybe in the sand underneath me, too. Maybe he wouldn't have time to decide which ones to move.</p><p>I held up two fingers, a ready seal, and gave him a fraction of a second to comprehend it.</p><p>"Cherry Blossom Blizzard Explosion!"</p><p>He swept his hand sideways, the sand following it out of the area, away from the stadium and away from us. Just in time. All the little linked notes I'd made went up, not quite concurrently but with little pockets one after the other, fire blaring into existence and fading again. Not all of them were in the sand, some just burned like tiny fireworks on the ground and in the air around me. They weren't strong explosions, not really; all up they were probably only the strength of one normal tag.</p><p>But 'strong' wasn't their purpose. They had done exactly what they were meant to do, and the idea was all Deidara's. I was using that for a variety of reasons. One, I knew it would work. Two, now so did Gaara.</p><p>And three, it had temporarily removed his greatest weapon. And that was what we in the biz liked to call 'an opening'.</p><p>Well, far be it from me to resist that kind of temptation.</p><p>"Shadow Stitching Jutsu!" Shadow Possession wouldn't work, as we'd found out back in Konoha Hospital – it had limited use against someone that could control their jutsu without hand signs or movements. But Shadow Stitching was basically a multipronged mid-range piercing attack, coming from multiple angles.</p><p>Gaara wasn't totally defenseless, of course. He hadn't emptied his sand gourd in chasing me, or defending, and therefore it wasn't full of exploding notes and had to be gotten rid of. The shape of it collapsed now, leaving nothing but a red sash, and piled into the air to defend him.</p><p>My shadow drove into it, some piercing, some not. Sand tried to travel back along the pathway of it, but I'd had enough of <em> that</em> for one exam, and dissolved the tendrils as they tried. No, I didn't want my own jutsu used as conduits to attack me, thanks.</p><p>On the downside, Shadow Stitching didn't really let me be hugely mobile. And that was not a good thing right now.</p><p>Stationary was a target and being a target was bad.</p><p>I ended the jutsu and pushed off, blitzing forward at the fastest speed that I could manage. It was not inconsiderable.</p><p>I feinted one direction, split an illusionary clone to continue on, and backtracked. I circled the other way and led with a leg sweep and a combination of taijutsu that was not so much meant to bypass the remaining barrier as to distract. Gaara was reacting well to the speed – clearly knowing that that weakness had been revealed and having dealt with it.</p><p>This close, I could see the particular roughness – fakeness – of his skin. It seemed as though he was wearing his Sand Armour. As expected. Good.</p><p>I flipped backwards, hands seeking and finding a particular scroll, before pushing off the ground and reversing, coming down on top of him like I meant to drop an axe kick on his head. That would get my leg caught in sand, almost certainly. And it would be game over for me.</p><p>So I opened the scroll and dropped a rock instead.</p><p>It didn't get the same amusing response that dropping one on Sasuke had received, unfortunately. It landed on him, cracked the Sand Armour and revealed that Gaara had abandoned it at the last moment with a nicely done Replacement Jutsu.</p><p>The empty sand shell dispersed, rising up around my tribute and trying to grab my legs. I bounced off the rock and up onto the nearest pillar, sprinting straight up into the air.</p><p>I knew where Gaara was. Probably could have guessed even without sensing him. He'd want to retrieve the majority of the sand that had been sent away. The explosions were finished now, the trap expended.</p><p>But I crouched on the opposite side of the pillar from him and gave myself a second to regroup. This whole fight was going to have to be quick volleys and retreats, otherwise I'd be overpowered and done for.</p><p>I was breathing harder now, the strain of the extreme chakra enhancement starting to show. And my chakra levels had taken a dip, but I wasn't particularly worried about that. But I wasn't injured yet, so I had options. I had soldier pills and I took one, flooding my system with a new burst of energy. This chakra was a little wilder, a little less controllable. It buzzed off my skin, crackled into the air. My muscles hummed with it. It would drain faster, probably, but not at an appreciable rate.</p><p>It was fine.</p><p>Everything was going about as expected.</p><p>I took a deep breath and set off the exploding seals on the fallen pillar. Partly for distraction, partly for the cover that the dust and smoke would give me.</p><p>Then I pulled out the Sword of the Thunder God and moved, jumping until I was positioned to face Gaara once more, and used it to launch huge sweeping arcs of lightning through the smoke. They were massive strikes, length to length nearly the size of the long side of the pitch – the side opposite the audience. I could have explained it as making sure he couldn't dodge sideways, as covering largest possible area I could. But it was also to show that I could.</p><p>Like seals, the sword was more efficient and simply <em> better</em> than what I could do without it. This was A-rank stuff, compared to the punny C-rank lightning jutsu I could do on my own.</p><p>The first arc forced Gaara back. His sand surged in front of him, an airborne shield that fell apart as the strike disrupted the bonds of it, sand gently collapsing to the ground until it could be reclaimed.</p><p>The second strike he was ready for.</p><p>"Sand Lightning Needles!" Gaara commanded, and two spikes of hard sand slammed into the earth one near either end of the arc. The lightning warped, drawn between them.</p><p>The third strike was therefore wasted, grounding harmlessly on the lightning rods. It was a faster response than I'd been expecting, but then, he had just fought Karui last round and she'd been quicker off the draw than me. It was a tactic he had only just used recently and familiar for it.</p><p>The three huge arcs of lightning dropped my levels right down. Not to worrying levels, but in a real fight, it would have been a fools move. Using so much chakra so fast without any appreciable result was a pretty good way to get yourself killed.</p><p>I pulled out another soldier pill and bit down. Two in short succession was pushing the limits of 'smart' but it would be fine. I felt like I was mainlining caffeine, like I'd had a triple shot espresso, a liter of energy drink.</p><p>I felt like I could fly.<em> Red bull gives you wings~</em></p><p>"Earth Style," I commanded. I dropped to one knee, let the sword fall and raced through the hand seals until I could press my palms flat on the ground. "Earth Spike!" Two sections of earth rose and surrounded the lightning rods, encasing them safely in dirt.</p><p>I gritted my teeth. It was closer to one jutsu used in two parts than trying to run two jutsu at once, but it was <em> hard. </em> I barely managed. If he'd made three then I wouldn't have been able to do it at all. But that put them out of commission for a short period of time, and that was all I really needed.</p><p>I scooped the lightsaber back up, pulling a scroll and wrapping it loosely around my arm. My fingers were sweating, jittering imperceptibly against the paper.</p><p>I braced my feet, like I was expecting kickback, and raised the sword, holding it straight out in front of me. Not a kenjutsu stance. Gun stance, maybe. Then I channeled chakra through the scroll on my arm, ten lights blinking on, one after the other, like a machine powering up. Blink blinkblink.</p><p>"<em> Lightning Style</em> ," I shouted, because volume meant something. "<em> Super Beam Cannon!"</em></p><p>I flicked the sword on, blade pointing straight at him.</p><p>By this point, there was no disbelief. Gaara didn't have a momentary pause of 'does she mean it'. Didn't stop to consider.</p><p>Which was good. Because I was so full of shit.</p><p>His sand raced together to form the best kind of shield he had. It clumped, thick and fast, until it looked like a Tanuki. It was striped with red markings, though I had no time to wonder where they came from.</p><p>"Shield of Shukaku."</p><p>I burst forward, pouring on the speed before the realization that it was a feint set in. My arm dropped, collapsing the sword and putting it away. I let the scroll flutter uselessly to the ground, purpose done. My other hand drew out specific scroll, snapped it open and trailing out into the air.</p><p>Then I slammed it hard onto the flat surface of the Shukaku's stomach.</p><p>"SEAL!" I roared.</p><p>The shield was only one 'object'. If one could call a thing compromised of thousands of tiny grains of sand an object. But it was held together with reasonable force, or it would never serve as a shield. So I didn't even have to use one of my new and 'improved' storage seals to manage this. A plain old 'put the thing in the thing' seal did just fine.</p><p>Of course, the thing was full of someone else's chakra. So that wasn't ideal.</p><p>It went in, with messy chakra smoke and protest. I immediately threw the scroll as hard as I could, as far as I could, just in case.</p><p>But for the second time I had gotten rid of the majority of Gaara's sand. Now to see if I could take advantage of it.</p><p>As it turned out, the answer to that question was a very fast and very sharp 'no'. Go figure. It wasn't that I was expecting him to have nothing but sand but… I'd kind of been expecting him to have nothing but sand.</p><p>I did a very nice swan dive into the ground. It was easy enough, the earth was loose and almost swampy because I'd taken pretty much all the rocky bits out and crushed them into giant pillars.</p><p>It was still a bit of a risky move, though, because I knew that Gaara could turn dirt into sand. Which meant I could be diving right into his territory. So to speak. But I was counting on the fact that his sand likely wouldn't be so spread out underground as to be beneath me, and also that I couldn't sense it.</p><p>Risky, but not that risky.</p><p>I popped up in the shadow of a pillar, enough cover not to be immediately visible to him. Then it was another scroll, one which I checked carefully. I'd had three water scrolls left over from the last exam, and while there was no technical reason they shouldn't still work, it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>I scaled the pillar and threw it out, arcing into the air above him. Gaara immediately tried to shoot it down with sand, because he knew how this went by now.</p><p>But the water thundered down and made that a little difficult. It splashed out, hitting the ground and rebounding, spray flickering off and getting in my face and hair and clothes.</p><p>I gathered chakra in my hands and thrust it into the falling water, gathering a blob and pulling it back. The old chakra control exercise that I'd never <em> really</em> used in a fight. But if I could show a reasonable approximation of water jutsu, then that was three out of five elements.</p><p>I tracked Gaara's chakra where he had body flickered away from the attack, spinning the water in my hands out into a staff. It was harder than I remembered, or maybe it was just my chakra right now was so amped up on chemicals that it was slightly <em> off.</em></p><p>Still. It would do.</p><p>I leapt after him.</p><p>The water staff lashed out, changing shape and twisting in my hands. His sand was slower where it was wet, but I was slowing down too, body reaching the limits of how far and fast I could push it.</p><p>Attack, attack, deflect.</p><p>It wasn't working.</p><p>Gaara was a nightmare. The kind of nightmare where you could run and run and never escape the footsteps that followed you oh so calmly. Except in this case, I was throwing everything I could at him and it wasn't doing anything.</p><p>If this had been a real fight – yeah, I would be feeling <em> really </em> cornered by now. I would be stressed and I would be panicking.</p><p>As it was, I just kind of… admired it.</p><p>I gathered it back together, abandoning the technique and just throwing the blob of water at him like a water bullet. It splashed against a shield of sand, already wet and making it no worse.</p><p>Then something gripped my ankle and I overbalanced, hand flying through the seals of a replacement jutsu to switch with a piece of rocky debris. And another, when that position turned out to be little better. Then another again.</p><p><em> Thank god for replacement tag</em> , I thought inanely. I slid on slushy ground past my pillar, feet and knees kicking mud up.</p><p>But the tide was turning. I was on the run now. Really on the run. The ground was churning with Gaara's chakra and it wouldn't be long now. Not long at all.</p><p>I'd had a good run.</p><p>"<em> Explode</em> !" I shouted, setting off those lovely Touch Blast seals I'd carefully set at the start of the match. Not all of them. I had to be careful. Had to make sure the pillars fell the right way, away from the crowd.</p><p>It wouldn't do for anyone to get hurt.</p><p>It was like an apocalypse. Explosions echoed and things tripped and fell and there was smoke and dust and confusion. For a second I couldn't tell which way was up, couldn't see or hear. It was like I was alone, in the smoke, the ground rumbling under my feet, swaying in the breeze.</p><p>Then I moved, jumping and hitting falling rocks and bouncing myself higher, up and out of danger. Away. Up. All that was left was up.</p><p>"Quicksand Waterfall Flow!"</p><p>All that was left was <em> up</em> because Gaara had commandeered <em> down.</em> Everything below us was sand, now. It surged past the pillars and columns, through the cracks and breaks, a vast sea of it. A desert.</p><p>Gaara of the desert.</p><p>Not Gaara, who belonged to the desert. Gaara who brought the desert with him. Gaara, who could turn a place into a desert.</p><p>"Nope," I decided, aiming up, up, up.</p><p>There was nothing up but sky.</p><p>I pulled out a scroll. Release a pillar into the air and used it as a stage, sprinting up it, even as it fell.</p><p>Then I jumped, leaping monkey, straight up into the air. The sand chased me. There was nowhere to go.</p><p>I twisted, like a cat, rotating my torso and spiralling around, until I was facing down again. I pulled out my last seal, this one a long sheet of paper folded into an accordion, back and forth on itself.</p><p>"Sealing Style: Air Barrier!"</p><p>The air <em> thrummed.</em> It pulled together, thickened and became heavy beneath the seal, chakra radiating outwards like bursts of light and holding it. For a second, it worked.</p><p>Then it didn't.</p><p>It whooshed downwards, barrier breaking and air descending like a thunderclap. The sand turned back, buffeted by the sudden force of wind.</p><p>Then I was falling. And the wave of sand rose to engulf me.</p><p>It was like hitting water. Like falling into the ocean from a great height. Not soft, exactly, but softer than hitting dirt. I sank into it and it covered me, cutting off light and sound.</p><p>It was quiet and dark.</p><p>I thought about one last hurrah. About turning to shadows and breaking free. But that was a jutsu I did not want to publicise here, and what else could I do? I had done all I could. And it hadn't been enough.</p><p>In a real fight, I would still be struggling. In a real fight, I would be dead.</p><p>But this wasn't a 'real' fight, so I was okay. I was at peace with it. I had come here to lose. I had shown what I could do, I had fought and I had lost. I was okay.</p><p>I closed my eyes, and let Gaara's sand move around me, buoy me up like I was floating in water. It wasn't so different. It was mostly soft and mostly warm. There was enough give around my arms and legs and chest to move and breathe. I wasn't hurt.</p><p>I had lost and it was okay.</p><p>I thought I was moving, but I had no points of reference. The chakra in the stands was as distant as the stars, muffled by the sand around me.</p><p>And then it was gone.</p><p>I blinked in the suddenly too-bright sunshine. I was standing, opposite Gaara, close to the positions we had started in.</p><p>And the field around us was…</p><p>Destroyed. It looked like the ruins of an ancient civilisation, worn and tattered pillars half swallowed by the desert. Like it had been lying here, exactly like this, for a thousand years.</p><p>It had been less than an hour.</p><p>My heart was roaring in my ears. No, no, it wasn't. That was the <em> crowd.</em> They were screaming. They were cheering. The thunder was applause.</p><p>I swayed in place.</p><p>Gaara stared at me. I stared at him.</p><p>Oh. Right. If he'd let me go, then the match had been called. Probably. Most likely. Because why else let your opponent go? The referee was staring at us both.</p><p>I bowed. "Thank you for the match."</p><p>That was polite. Right? Yes. Polite. Good. Now I needed to get back to the competitors arena.</p><p>I turned to look at it. That was an <em> awfully</em> long way away.</p><p>"Shikako," Gaara said.</p><p>I looked at him. Looked up. He was rising, sand underneath his feet. Oh. That was clever. And he was holding a hand out towards me.</p><p>I took it. Let him lift me up. Let his sand carry us on a magic carpet ride towards the stadium.</p><p><em> I can show you the world, shining, shimmering splendour~</em></p><p>It was much easier than walking. That was for sure. I wasn't entirely sure I could have made it.</p><p>Hands reached out to grab me when I got there. Supporting, holding, congratulating and slapping. Ino was frowning at me, face creased into lines of worry, her fingers pressing tight to the pulse in my wrist.</p><p>"The Shikabane-hime strikes again," she said, almost caustically, reminding me that Ino was a sensor too and absolutely had to know how low on chakra I was right this second. After taking two soldier pills.</p><p>I made a sound of displeasure at her. She'd said that far too loud. People would hear it. I would get stuck with that dumb name <em> forever</em> . It would be like getting called 'Chucky' all your life because you threw up at a primary school birthday party once.</p><p>I tripped, but was held up.</p><p>"Soldier pill crash is a bitch, right?" Kiba said, sympathetically. A canteen was pressed into my hands. "Drink this; it'll help."</p><p>I fumbled with it, but my hands were trembling too badly to get the lid off. They slipped on it, wet and nerveless.</p><p>Someone else took it off me. Opened it. Gave it back.</p><p>"Thanks," I croaked. "I'm fine, I'm fine. You can all stop fussing."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I was going to stick with One Chapter One Round, but this fight was the one everyone was waiting for. So. Here it is.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there.

"And here I thought you were only good at getting stabbed."</p><p>"My talents are many and varied," I said solemnly, not having the energy to get upset about his poking. Kiba's suspicious Inuzuka concoction had reduced my post-soldier pill shaking from 'uncontrollable seizures' to 'merely shivering' but I still felt terrible.</p><p>And it was my own fault for taking two soldier pills then driving myself to chakra exhaustion, so I couldn't even complain about it.</p><p>"They sure as hell are," Kankurou agreed, which was high praise. Truly. "You know, there's a saying in Suna about giving a seal master time to prepare. It goes a little like; <em> Don't.</em> "</p><p>"Words of wisdom," I agreed, which appeared to satisfy him and whatever two cents worth of opinion he wanted to give. He moved off, sauntering back towards Gaara and Temari.</p><p>"I don't know if I like that guy," Ino muttered quietly. "Jerk."</p><p>"He's alright." I shrugged. "He looked after Hinata." Said girl went a little pink across the cheeks, indicating she was listening, but didn't say anything.</p><p>"Please raise your standards," Ino said. She went through another round of fussing, checking my temperature and pulse and pulling Chouji's donated – and dry – jacket closer around my shoulders. "Are you sure you don't want to see the medics?"</p><p>I forced down another tasteless bite of ration bar. "Food and rest," I said. "That's all they're going to recommend. You know it. I know it. Even Kiba knows it."</p><p>"Hey, which of us has the most experience with soldier pills?" Kiba shot back, because he had no problems with interrupting conversations after someone mentioned his name. Or ever, really. "I don't appreciate that 'even'."</p><p>"Especially Kiba knows it?" I corrected.</p><p>Down on the field belong, ninja were scurrying about and then congregating to discuss. Possibly to decide what they were going to do for the next fight. There was really no chance of fixing the field – which I refused to feel bad about – and there was nowhere to really move the fights to, because the stadium was right here.</p><p>Neji and Lee were called down, and it seemed they had just decided to go with it as it was.</p><p>"Thank you <em> so much,</em> " Sasuke said, glaring. "I have to fight Gaara next <em> in a desert.</em> "</p><p>"Excuse you," Kiba said, giving him a challenging look. "I'm going to win our fight, so <em> I'm</em> the one she just screwed over."</p><p>"Oops," I said. "Ah. Well."</p><p>I looked at Ino. She shrugged. No, no ideas there either.</p><p>"You want some exploding notes?"</p><p>Sasuke rolled his eyes. "Somehow, I don't think that will be enough."</p><p>"I can make a seal for you," I offered uncertainly. "But that was basically every idea I had that I thought would work against him. I don't know what else I could make."</p><p>"No," Sasuke said. "I'll fight it my way. You're just going to owe me forever."</p><p>"Okay," I agreed peaceably and dropped my head onto his shoulder. "Now shush. We have to watch Lee and Neji."</p><p>I'd always wondered how it worked, when Lee was so good and so fast, that he still always lost to Neji who Naruto had beaten. The difference, it seemed, was that Lee had no choice but to engage in taijutsu (and probably frankly never considered doing otherwise) or at close range with a staff, which was slightly safer but only slightly.</p><p>While Lee was fast, and had great skill, a single touch would spell doom for him.</p><p>And Neji had complete and utter control over his area of divination. If he was slower, it wasn't sufficient to hamper him because his 360 degree vision let him see any attack coming in more than enough time to prepare for it.</p><p>What was impressive was the amount of feints, the amount of attacks that Lee aborted at the <em> very</em> last moment, the way he managed to pull back before they could be touched with Gentle Fist and turned into an injury.</p><p>The crowd collectively groaned when the first one landed.</p><p>Lee skidded backwards.</p><p>"Is that all?" Neji asked, sliding into a ready stance, palms forward and steady.</p><p>Lee grinned, a blinding flash of white teeth. "Hidden Lotus!"</p><p>Opening the gates might have given him extra power and extra speed but they also started the clock ticking. He couldn't hope to outlast Neji like this, couldn't count on having greater stamina and forcing Neji to expend his chakra defensively like Naruto had.</p><p>But then, Lee wanted to prove he could be a splendid ninja with only taijutsu. So he was going to use taijutsu to prove it.</p><p>And despite how spectacular the fight was, I yawned and let my eyes slip closed. The sounds of combat were a strange lullaby, backed by the noises of the crowd. I drifted, not quite asleep, but brain transposing the sounds into pictures, pulling scenarios and locations out of memories and then stringing them together in a way that seemed perfectly logical. I was watching a game on TV and the crowd was cheering, and all the competitors were Lee except for one who was Neji and all the Lee's kept ganging up on him, except they were <em> supposed</em> to be on his team but no one seemed to notice, except I was outside and the wind kept blowing in my face and then it was summer and it kept getting hotter and hotter and everything became a desert-</p><p>I woke, utterly disorientated, headache raging and mouth dry.</p><p>"It's too hot," I complained, trying to shove the jacket off. Heat was trapped in my skin, trying to radiate away. It needed to go away.</p><p>Sasuke's fingers were cool against my forehead. "Fever," he said, glancing up and away, to someone else. "Is that normal?"</p><p>"For soldier pill crash, yeah," Kiba said. "Because of the shivering, you see? You think you're cold, so you shiver, then you're too hot…"</p><p>"Have some water," Ino suggested kindly, giving me a canteen.</p><p>I took a sip. It was nice and cool. Then I splashed it onto hand and wiped it across my face. That was even better. I shimmied out of clothing until I was down to my singlet, reapplying cold water to my forehead and the back of my neck.</p><p><em> Soldier pills are the worst</em> , I decided. This hadn't happened any other time I'd taken them. Then again, I'd never taken so many at once, either.</p><p>"Maybe this will help," Haku said.</p><p>I looked up. I hadn't even noticed him coming closer. He drew a circle in the air with his hands, ice crystalizing in the gaps between his fingers, starting thin and growing slightly thicker and wider on the other side, almost to a triangle point. Ino watched, mildly wary, but Sasuke didn't so much as tense up beside me.</p><p>He passed it over. I put it on, the thin side sitting easily on my hair, the thicker side against my forehead. It melted easily against my fevered skin, dripping cool water down my face. "You're the best," I said, eyes sliding shut. "A plus use of a blood limit in a non-combat setting. Gold star."</p><p>Then I blinked them back open, realizing what was missing. "Who won?" The between-fight entertainment was moving about below, and there was no sign of the two competitors. I'd slept right through the end of the match.</p><p>"Hyuuga," Sasuke said. "But barely." He shook his head. "I'm kicking Kiba's ass next. You think you can keep your eyes open for that?"</p><p>I propped my chin in my hand and my elbow against my knees. Mostly upright, minimal effort required.</p><p>"In your dreams," Kiba scoffed. "You better stay awake to watch me kick <em> his</em> ass. Otherwise you'll never believe it."</p><p>They razzed each other all the way down to the field below, right up until the start of the match.</p><p>And okay, the match was impressive. But we'd been training together for a week before we'd been sent here. They both knew what was going to happen down on that field, in the most general sense. There were tricks, yes, and twists to the fight from on-the-spot innovations, but they knew each other well and knew what was likely to show up.</p><p>And that counted for a lot.</p><p>It wasn't a bad fight. It showed a lot of skills. It was exciting. The crowd clearly liked them both. Sasuke won. I didn't want to say 'of course' but… I wasn't surprised, either.</p><p>The final fight of the day started at three. It was Haku and Hinata.</p><p>It was an interesting matchup. They were both the sweetest of people – the kind that didn't really like to settle things by combat but would if they had to. If they really had to. Steel, beneath the sweetness.</p><p>"As the last remaining shinobi from Kirigakure, it is important that I remain in this tournament," Haku said quietly. "For the dreams of our village… so please do not resent me for this."</p><p>Hinata gave a slow, shallow nod. She understood fighting for your dreams. She had fought for hers. But there was no fire in her eyes now, not for this match.</p><p>He'd taken it out of her, before the fighting had even started. Calculated or sincere, it didn't really matter. It could have even been both, but he'd just tipped the scales in his favour, heavily.</p><p>And even if there had been… in the next few minutes I wasn't sure if it would have mattered.</p><p>Because Haku had switched tactics. Mostly he'd used speed before, which was how he had fought us all those months ago, backed with his ice jutsu. This time, he spread his hands, finding all the water that had splashed around the field from my fight, soaked into the sand and dirt, and brought it up, using it to create towering walls of ice. Levels and mazes of ice.</p><p>I frowned, bringing my fingertips together in front of my mouth.</p><p>He didn't need that to fight Hinata.</p><p>It worked, of course. Haku was fast, and if she could break his ice with Jyuuken it would take a lot of effort. Naruto had been able to break them, but only with Kyuubi. So it put him out of reach and let him box her in and engage without risking himself.</p><p>But he didn't need it. And the chakra cost of a jutsu that size meant that you wouldn't do it just because. Not when you had a fight again tomorrow.</p><p>Water trickled down my forehead, the ice cooling my fevered skin.</p><p><em> Oh.</em> <em> Think three moves ahead.</em></p><p>"It's not melting," I said, out loud. The chakra cost of making it might have been huge. But what was the cost of maintaining it? Greater or smaller than the rate you recovered chakra? The water would have dried up by tomorrow – by the day after – but it was here now. Take all advantages while you had them, right?</p><p>He didn't need it to fight Hinata. Might not have even needed it to fight Neji, depending on how the fight with Lee had ended. But if you were aiming to fight Gaara – Gaara who had already turned the field into his preferred terrain – then, yes, you would absolutely want to stack every advantage you could.</p><p>Three moves ahead.</p><p>Clever. But insulting to Hinata, to say he didn't have to focus on fighting her right there and then. That he could think ahead to other matches and start planning for them.</p><p>So for us, the day ended on a little bit of a downer. Four of us had lost. One for every match fought today. We only had two still in the game – Sasuke and Neji.</p><p>But the mood at dinner wasn't dull. Of those of us that had lost, I was happy. Lee was promising to do better, loudly and at great length. Kiba was giving Sasuke an equal amount of ribbing to what he had before the fight.</p><p>"We could go and check out the festival," Ino said, hopefully.</p><p>I kind of just wanted to go to sleep. Forever, if possible. But. "Sure," I said. I was a little curious. And how many chances would we get, at something like this. Better to make the most of it while we could.</p><p>So those of us who were interested gathered together after dinner and went back out into the town. Asuma and Kurenai were shadowing us, keeping distance and seeming more occupied with each other than anything. Whether they were using the 'date' as an excuse to follow us, or following us as an excuse for the date, I didn't know.</p><p>Even though we'd just eaten, there were plenty of street vendors selling food. And souvenirs and festival games and musicians wafting music through the streets. We played a few, frittered away small amounts of money on keepsakes, just a few more faces in the crowd enjoying the night out.</p><p>Of course, we had <em> recognizable </em> faces.</p><p>"No," I said, for the twelfth time. "I didn't break the Kantokusha Clan jutsu. Or avoid it. I merely had a strategy that allowed me to keep fighting while it was active. No, I can't teach anyone it. No, it's not part of a blood limit. I <em> didn't break it.</em> "</p><p>Ino gently tugged me away by my elbow, because I was trying to be polite and not just abandon a conversation rudely, no matter how annoying.</p><p>"I'm surprised they're more interested in that one than your fight with Gaara," she said.</p><p>"They've all been Grass-nin," I said. "I think." Because they'd been ninja, clearly. But not all of them had been wearing easily identifiable headbands or signs, and the only ninja that would probably be <em> allowed</em> to do that at a cross village event were the hosts. Everyone else had to be watched and identified. "I guess it's not surprising that they want to know, when the prison is their big… thing."</p><p>If someone had come to Konoha and showed a way to beat Shadow Possession that looked easy and doable, then we would all have been <em> very</em> interested. Rinse and repeat for any other technique or blood limit of your choice. And the prison made it a bigger thing, too, because it was where <em> other</em> villages sent ninja criminals that they didn't want to deal with, but didn't necessarily want to kill, trusting the Blood Prison could keep them locked up nice and tight.</p><p>It occurred to me that my match with Muku might have shone a brighter light on me than I'd anticipated.</p><p>"Just annoying, right?" Ino agreed. We walked a little faster, to catch up with the rest of the group, who had spread and scattered. There was no need for us to all cling together, but we were all in eyesight.</p><p>We ran into Temari and Kankurou near one of the busier streets of town. The crowd seemed to mostly be streaming one way, like there was something going on in that direction.</p><p>"You guys going to the theatre, too?" Kankurou asked, seeming reasonably animated. He had a paper program in his hand.</p><p>"We weren't intending on it," Ino answered, neutrally. "Is something on?"</p><p>"The Imada Puppet Troupe are here," Kankurou replied. "Performing one of Namiki's plays. They're supposed to be really good. Like, 'we only play for Daimyo' really good. You don't want to miss it."</p><p>I had a second to reassess, as my world realigned to a new truth being revealed.</p><p><em> Kankurou is a theatre nerd.</em></p><p>It made so much sense. The Sand Puppet Corps were known to infiltrate places in the guise of actual performance teams, but that was window dressing. It didn't explain the face paint or the clothing. They weren't required. He was a highly trained military operative. He was also a major theatre nerd.</p><p>I managed to not giggle hysterically.</p><p>"That sounds interesting," I said politely. "I've never seen a puppet troupe perform."</p><p>He actually gaped. Even Temari raised an eyebrow in mute surprise. "Really?"</p><p>I didn't think it was that surprising. I glanced at Ino; she shook her head. "They're not allowed into Konoha," she clarified. "It's considered too high risk, the same as Kabuki actors."</p><p>Because Sand Puppet Corps were known to infiltrate in the guise of performers. Obviously.</p><p>"That's just <em> sad</em> ," Kankurou said. "You can't go five paces in Suna without tripping over kids practicing their puppet jutsu doing street performances."</p><p>I had the sudden image of Hidden Sand doing the equivalent of the Academy performances that we did, of tiny children awkwardly marching giant puppets around a stage with loud awkward over acting, to the applause of parental figures. One of those tiny children may have been wearing a floppy cat eared hat, just in my imagination.</p><p>Which is how he ended up convincing us we really should go and watch this play. I agreed, because it did sound interesting. So did Ino and Hinata.</p><p>"Well, if Hinata's going," Kiba said, not looking enthused but also not willing to split.</p><p>Tenten bowed out, though, taking Lee with her. Thankfully. I wasn't sure he was the type that would sit quietly through a long performance. Though maybe that was being unfair. Chouji dithered, but was ultimately more attracted to the idea of festival food than theatre and went with them.</p><p>Which meant Asuma and Kurenai split up. Kurenai-sensei gave up the pretense of not being part of the group and just became our adult escort. But as a bonus, she brought the tickets, so none of us complained. Not that her team would have anyway.</p><p>Temari didn't come inside with us, though. "I've seen more than enough bunraku," she said. "You can bore someone else with it all this time."</p><p>Kankurou made a face at her.</p><p>I smiled. Brother and sister. Absolutely.</p><p>"It's not boring," he muttered. "Come on, then. We have to get some good seats. You're going to love it."</p><p><hr /></p><p>A couple of hours later we were swept outside with the rest of the exiting crowd, from the stuffy hot air inside into the crisp night outside.</p><p>I wasn't sure I'd say I'd loved it. But it had been interesting. Kankurou had been a wealth of information in the breaks and intermissions, about the puppets and the puppeteers and the story line. But it had been long and complicated and I had been the kind of person who liked my movies to be straightforward and involving car chases and explosions.</p><p>No comment.</p><p>"So what did you think?" I asked, turning to look at the rest. Only to find that the crowd had swept me away from them. Not far. Only a person, or two away. Barely anything at all. Someone had just pushed between us, that was all. But there were so many people streaming out of the theater that it would be hard to elbow my way against the flow and get back to them. Everyone was chattering in excitement, and I awkwardly squeezed past a couple to try and meet up with the others again.</p><p>And then a hand clamped over my face.</p><p>Not a hand. A cloth. Covered in something sickly sweet and chemical.</p><p>Another arm wrapped around me, lifting and bundling me away.</p><p>My head swam, immediately. I tried to hold my breath, but it was too late. I wasted a second squirming, tried to stomp on feet and elbow them, but my motions had no force. My muscles were gone, weakened, useless. I tried to grab my chakra, what was left of it, tried to use my shadows, but it was like trying to hold water. I might have started but it was gone before there was any effect.</p><p>My lungs protested. They wanted air. My eyes were blurring, ears ringing. My heart was pounding, a startled, irregular rhythm.</p><p>I twisted. One hand, almost too heavy to lift, reached up and pushed against his chin. The weakest of protests. There was no force behind it.</p><p>I focused, the last of my concentration narrowed down to one pinpoint.</p><p>And then I had to breathe, and I was gone.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

Thompson</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I was groggy and nauseous and not even sure I was really awake.</p><p>But I was also panicking. My heart was still beating its staccato rhythm in my chest, spurring adrenaline through my system. <em> Now, now, move now</em> it sang. <em> You have no time.</em></p><p>My face was pressed against concrete. Gravel bit into my cheek. It was a distant feeling, devoid of any pain. Just a fact to be acknowledged. Probably not good. My eyes were blurry. Or it was dark. Was it dark?</p><p>I fumbled, moving my arms until I could get them under me, could push myself upright.</p><p>Not restrained. That was something. That meant something.</p><p>But the world swam as I tried to move. The ground tried to throw me off. I retched; tried not to throw up. Threw up anyway. The acid stink of vomit was competing with some other kind of smell. Burning meat. Blood.</p><p>There were hands on my shoulders.</p><p>I twisted away. Tried to fumble with my chakra. There was nothing there. Nothing there at all. Just a blank guttering void inside me. Not good.</p><p>My heart tripped, stuttering over its beating.</p><p>"Shikako! Shikako, it's us!" I heard the words, heard the sounds but they took so long to organize into meaning. To become <em> safe.</em></p><p>"She blew up his head. That's sick."</p><p>"Shut up, Kankurou." Ino. That was Ino's voice. The hands on my back, moving me, they were Ino's hands. The chakra sweeping unsteadily through me, that was Ino's chakra. She sounded distressed. Felt distressed. <em> Ino.</em></p><p>"He deserved it," Kiba said, voice underscored by a low, threatening growl that just went on and on. Akamaru, then.</p><p>Something. There was. Something important. I should. There was something missing.</p><p>"Hinata?" I croaked, the world travelling light years to spill out my mouth. My tongue fumbled against my teeth, blurring the sounds.</p><p>Someone burst into tears. Okay. That was Hinata. Good.</p><p><em> Not good. Why is she crying?</em> Who dared make Hinata cry like that?</p><p>I threw up again. My arms collapsed. Just gave way beneath me with no warning. Someone caught me, held me up so I didn't land in my own vomit. Lovely.</p><p>Then there was a sound like a sonic boom. Like someone sliding out of body flicker so fast and so hard the world around them had to make space. Killing intent simmered in the air, bright and cold. Like lightning.</p><p>I'd never felt it before. But it was familiar and comforting all the same.</p><p>Sharingan no Kakashi had arrived and was ready to <em> murder the fuck</em> out of people.</p><p>I closed my eyes.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next time I woke, I was drowning in chakra. It flooded my lungs, filled my throat. I couldn't breathe.</p><p>"Stop being dramatic," Tsunade said irritably, and my lungs went up and down without my permission. My heart beat in a steady rhythm under her strict guidance. Her chakra was filling me up, was everywhere, little lights inside my blood.</p><p>I opened my eyes.</p><p>Her hand moved away from my face, hovered over my chest for a second, then withdrew. The feeling of drowning went with it.</p><p>I gasped, choked a little, but breathed easier. There was a residual hum of her chakra, green and friendly, left behind in the empty spaces where I had nothing. I was still chakra exhausted. But chakra exhausted like I had been following my match with Gaara, not like I had spent that very crucial last piece trying to escape a kidnapping.</p><p>Kidnapping. Right.</p><p>I sat up. Pretty much every part of me protested. But the ground wasn't trying to throw me off any more. Any improvement was accepted, at this stage.</p><p>We were in an alley, maybe only a street or two away from the theater. They hadn't managed to take me very far. It was a little crowded. Ino, hovering at my side, eyes red and looking at Tsunade with a look of undisguised wonder. Kiba, Hinata and Kankurou slightly further off with Kurenai. Kakashi, posture ramrod straight for once, glaring daggers at a familiar Grass ninja – the women who had been in charge of the Exams. She was flustered, glancing away from his exposed Sharingan. Further out, more Grass nin holding a barricade, keeping people from looking in, maybe setting up genjutsu so it didn't look like there was anything here.</p><p>And the headless corpse, lying only feet away from me. Couldn't forget that. I had a vivid recollection of trying to plant a Touch Blast on him. It had been a last resort, because I'd had no other choice, because it had been the only thing left I could even try. I'd had no idea whether it had worked or not.</p><p>Obviously it had. Thankfully. I'd had little enough concentration, but it was something I had practiced hugely. Just this morning I'd planted them with my feet while evading Gaara's attacks, using only a fraction of my attention. And even if it hadn't been one hundred percent correct, it had still done what I'd needed it to. Explode.</p><p><em> I will never complain about being known for these, </em> I thought, semi-hysterically. <em> Ever again.</em></p><p>"Bullshit," Kakashi-sensei snarled at the Grass nin. His anger was roiling off of him in almost tangible waves, a separate feeling to the tightly leashed killing intent. This was the Kakashi Hatake that other villages knew. This was the threat. The danger. "I want to know what the fuck you think you're playing at. A kidnapping in the middle of the exams?"</p><p>She stepped back, hands up and palms out, pacifying, almost a gesture of surrender. "We will have to identify him before I can give you any information. That might be," her eyes drifted across, "slightly difficult. This was not ordered by Kusagakure in any way, shape, or form. Of that I am certain. I will get to the bottom of this."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei gave the fullest impression of sneering, for someone whose mouth was covered. "Bullshit," he repeated. His sharingan spun, angrily.</p><p>Tsunade sighed and rose gracefully, brushing the dirt and gravel from her pants. "Kakashi," she said mildly. "Stand down. I'm sure Hidden Grass is going to cooperate to the <em> fullest</em> of their abilities." And her smile was no less terrifying than his rage had been. "This is obviously a very serious situation. We wouldn't want it to escalate."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei reluctantly stepped back. He obviously didn't want to but this really wasn't the place to challenge the Hokage.</p><p>"Shikako," Tsunade continued. "Describe what happened."</p><p>I put aside the little gibbering corner of my mind, and tried to arrange my recollections in a coherent way.</p><p>"We left the theater," I said. "I was separated by the crowd. I didn't think much of it – there were a lot of people and the doors aren't that wide. I was on the left hand side of the road. I was trying to get back to Kurenai-sensei when someone grabbed me from behind. They put a cloth over my face with some kind of chemical anesthetic. Chloroform, maybe." I shrugged. If Tsunade couldn't tell from healing me, then the cloth was bound to be around here somewhere. "They pulled me out of the crowd and down one of the alleys, I think. It was very fast. I don't know if anyone noticed."</p><p>"And then?" she prompted.</p><p>I looked at the body. <em> Kaboom,</em> my mind suggested helpfully. "I got free?" I said. "I think the others found me. It's a bit hazy."</p><p>That appeared to be satisfactory, anyway. I guessed the others had told her their side already. And the evidence pretty much spoke for itself here.</p><p>I'd probably only been out for a few minutes the first time, before being found by Ino and the rest, if that. They'd have been fast and I wasn't far away. Maybe a bit longer the second time, if Tsunade had been called and arrived and healed me.</p><p>Tsunade nodded. "Kurenai, take the kids back to the cabins and keep them there. Get Asuma to take his lot back too. They're on total lockdown now. No one goes anywhere."</p><p>Which was a fair enough response. We had too many clan heirs and blood limits here to take this lightly. It didn't matter if it was a one off, because if it wasn't handled right it could very easily become a free for all. With us as the prize.</p><p>I struggled to my feet. And very swiftly had an Ino under one arm and a Kiba under the other. On one hand, yes, good. On the other, I didn't like the obvious weakness in front of all the other ninja. I'd been kidnapped, I'd been knocked out, I'd needed healing and now I couldn't even walk on my own.</p><p><em> Kaboom</em> , my mind repeated, quietly. I looked up. Caught the eye of anyone who was looking at me and held it, with that thought repeating. <em> Kaboom</em> .</p><p>Kurenai herded us away, through the streets towards the cabins. Her hand was on my shoulder, a steady presence, strong but slightly chilled.</p><p>"I'm sorry," she said, voice tight. "That should never have happened."</p><p>"There was another ninja," Ino said, explaining to me, quietly. Her voice was steady, but she was holding onto me so tightly. "He hit the crowd with a genjutsu. Nothing serious, really. We thought it was just a joke. Kurenai-sensei reversed it back on him and took him down."</p><p>He'd drawn the attention of our Jounin. Maybe he'd been part of it, a two man team, or maybe the other guy had just seen the chance and taken it.</p><p>"Then when we looked back," Ino continued. "You were gone. Just… vanished out of the crowd. Between one blink and the next. Everyone was panicking because of the genjutsu, and we couldn't find you."</p><p>They'd been fast, then. It had felt fast, to me, but I'd been in the middle of it. Any ninja could have managed it, though, it was just a matter of speed and timing. And luck.</p><p>"We would have found you anyway," Kiba said, confidently. "Even if you hadn't blown up his fucking face. No way could they have hidden from me and Hinata." Akamaru barked once, as if emphasizing the point.</p><p>I nodded, lethargically. "You know who they were?"</p><p>Kurenai-sensei's hand squeezed, gently. "I'm sure Kakashi-san will find out."</p><p>"They're saying he's not a Hidden Grass ninja," Hinata said, voice quiet.</p><p>I tilted my head to look at her. It felt like trying to move the world with my neck. Her Byakugan was going. Ah. Information gathering. Could she read lips like that?</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei doesn't believe them," Hinata continued. "I don't think Tsunade-sama does either."</p><p>Of course they'd be saying that. No way did they want Konoha to come down on them like a ton of bricks. A ton of angry Kakashi. That was a lot of angry Kakashi-sensei. They would go squish. "Say he's an infiltrator, take the slap on the wrist for a security flaw," I mumbled.</p><p>"There's other possibilities, though," Ino said, and she looked at Hinata too. "Other than Grass."</p><p>"Let's not speculate," Kurenai-sensei said, calmly. "Let's just get you back to the cabins, okay?"</p><p>The cabins were a flurry of confusion and activity. The Jounin sensei were all outside, looking casual but covering enough of the perimeter between them that it had to be anything but. Asuma-sensei was already there, he'd hustled his group back once the commotion had started, as a precaution, but none of them had actually known what was going down.</p><p>He took one look at us, face grim, and directed us inside. I could feel the mental security alert ticking higher.</p><p>Everyone exploded into questions all at once, talking over each other.</p><p>"What <em> happened?</em> " Sasuke demanded, taking one look at me. "We heard the explosion. That was you, right?"</p><p>That would explain how Kakashi-sensei had arrived so quickly. <em> Thank you, explosions</em> , I thought.</p><p>"Someone tried to kidnap Shikako-chan," Ino said grimly, not even attempting to break the ice gently. Though how would you go about that? <em> Well, I'm sorry to say, there was a small incident. And by small I mean large. And by large I mean-</em></p><p>There was a brief beat of silence. And then everyone exploded into questions again. This time there wasn't even the hope of picking one voice out from the rest.</p><p>"Hey, hey!" Kiba barked. "Let her sit down. Then you can hear all about it."</p><p>I was dragged to one of the beds and propped up on it. Then bundled in layers of blankets until I could barely move a muscle. Water and food appeared out of nowhere and were forced into my face. In between resisting my over eager helpers, I could see Hinata and Neji having a quiet, hurried conversation.</p><p>"Tsunade-sama and Kakashi-sensei are over there demanding answers," Ino said, after filling them in on what had actually happened that we knew about. It wasn't a lot, truthfully. We knew the where and the how, but the who and why… that was the important stuff.</p><p>"It was either a really good attempt or a really bad one," she said. "I'm not sure which. It failed, so I want to say 'bad' but… it nearly worked. If they'd had somewhere to take her nearby where we couldn't follow…"</p><p>If they'd tried to launch an immediate retaliation, a full ninja response to follow me, it might have looked like Konoha was the aggressor. Might not have worked, but it might have muddied waters for long enough. And who knows what would have happened next.</p><p>I shivered. And immediately had Akamaru bundled down my front like a furry hot water bottle.</p><p>If they'd been smart enough to know how to avoid a tracking team. If. If. If. They'd been smart enough to get me out of the crowd, to distract the others. Had it just been a moment of opportunity? Had they arranged it?</p><p>"You killed him?" Neji asked, voice flat and face hard.</p><p>I nodded, tiredly. "Yeah. It was all I could do." Later, when I had the energy to be horrified, I would be horrified at how close I'd been to <em> not</em> getting away. At the way I had had so few options. I was too tired for it, right now. It would involve incriminations and regrets.</p><p>"That's not good," Neji said, completely failing to read my mind. <em> Rude.</em></p><p>Sasuke stood, angry and confrontational. "It was the best thing she could have done," he snarled. "And if she hadn't killed him, I'd do it myself!"</p><p>Neji shook his head. "It's not," he repeated, but not angrily. Maybe wearily. Maybe resigned. "Because now there's no proof there even <em> was</em> a kidnapping. Or any way to get answers about what went down."</p><p>He was likening it to what had happened in Konoha ten years ago. It was nearly the same. A kidnapping gone bad. And if that had taught us anything, it was that it could still go worse.</p><p>"Kurenai-sensei caught the other one, though. He's alive," Ino said slowly. It was clear she was thinking through all the implications. There was something clear and empty about her expression, like she was a marble statue, unmoving through the ages. I wondered if I looked like that, when I thought hard. Probably I just looked confused. "And he used genjutsu on the crowd. There are bound to be other ninja that can collaborate that fact. So it's clear we didn't start it."</p><p>"Okay," Tenten said, a calm head amidst all the worried faces. "So who benefits? Basic investigation question, right? Who benefits from trying to take Shikako?"</p><p>There was a moment of silence. I'm sure more than one of us was thinking the same thing.</p><p>"If they were after bloodlines, I'd be the last pick," I said, when it was clear no one else would say the obvious thing. "Not with Hinata and Ino right next to me." In terms of inheritable abilities, doujutsu and mindreading beat out shadows. Not even a hard decision. "So it was me, specifically, that they wanted. Something I did, or something I know."</p><p>Which was weird and baffling. But I'd played a strong hand here at the exams, so there might have been people who wanted to cash in on it. Or were annoyed by it.</p><p>Hidden Grass was the obvious pick. Was it too obvious? Or had they been <em> that</em> worried by the fight with Muku?</p><p>Too many questions; no answers.</p><p>I yawned, eyelids like atlas failing to lift the world.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I woke groggy and smothered in dogs.</p><p>That… wasn't right.</p><p>I cracked my eyes open and squinted. "Pakkun, why dog?" I asked plaintively.</p><p>The pug put a tiny paw on my cheek. "Boss thought you might get into trouble," he said in his gravel voice. "Can't imagine why. He asked us to keep an eye out."</p><p>That made sense. It explained the heavy weight across my feet. And the ones beside me. The bed was crowded. Except. "That's not a dog."</p><p>Pakkun sighed. "He asked that weird friend of his to leave a summons, too."</p><p>"Gai-sensei is a turtle," I agreed knowledgably, and went back to sleep.</p><p>I slept for most of the day, briefly waking up to eat and go bathroom. Asuma-sensei was clearly on guard duty, spending most of the day sprawled on the next bunk over, reading a battered hardcover book and smoking. But the cigarette smoke was all drifting eerily out an opened window and I couldn't even smell it.</p><p>"I've had worse assignments," he said to me at one point. Or I thought he did. Maybe. My chakra exhaustion, the soldier pills, it was all catching up with me. Had caught me. It was not a whole lot of fun.</p><p>And then everyone returned and the cabin was suddenly full of noise and life. I went from mostly sleeping to mostly awake, propping myself up on an elbow to greet them.</p><p>Sasuke shook his head.</p><p>"No?" I guessed, not really sure how to interpret that.</p><p>"Finals are Gaara and Haku," Tenten said, looking at Neji almost apologetically. "Konoha is out of the running."</p><p>"Whatever," Sasuke said. "Doesn't matter." But he paced the room like a caged animal, shoulders stiff.</p><p>"It was a good fight, Sasuke-kun," Ino said, but her voice was a shade too flat to really sell her enthusiasm. "I had no idea you were that good at genjutsu! And those ninjutsu were amazing!"</p><p>"You didn't even want to go and watch it," Chouji said to her, sinking down onto his bunk and rummaging in his packs for food. "You wanted to stay in the cabins."</p><p>Ino shoved my legs over, climbed over a dog and managed to situate herself on my bed. Somehow. "Of course I did," she said impatiently. "But Tsunade-sama said she wanted us all in one place together. And she said you were fine and wouldn't be awake, anyway."</p><p>Lee sat down on the turtle, which looked completely resigned to being used as furniture.</p><p>I laid back down and let the chatter wash over me, of the way the fights had gone and other details of the day.</p><p>When I next swam into awareness, the scene had changed. It was later now, darker and quieter. Everyone was sprawled around the floor, playing cards – Shinobi's Rest, which had flexible rules and didn't really matter how many players, time or cards you had. We'd learnt it in the Academy, way back when, under the topic I'd called 'When Teachers Don't Actually Want to Teach' but Iruka-sensei had sworn up and down was 'Appropriate Downtime Activities For Ninja On Missions'. Without the swearing. Obviously. Because Iruka-sensei.</p><p>Funnily enough, this might have been the first time I'd ever seen it actually played on a mission. So maybe he was right, after all. Maybe I just did the wrong kinds of missions.</p><p>"Are you betting on who gets to carry me home?" I asked sleepily, wondering if I had heard correctly and whether I should be offended or not.</p><p>"Yosh! I have lost every round!" Lee said, terribly excited.</p><p>I squinted at him. "Shikako out," I decided and closed my eyes again. Going to sleep was such an <em> excellent</em> method of escaping conversations that I wanted no part in. I was sad in advance for when it no longer worked. Maybe I would just pretend to be chakra exhausted forever. That would work, right?</p><p><hr /></p><p>"You can't be serious," Kurenai-sensei said. "Why would you tell them? They don't need to deal with this, Kakashi. They're just Genin. It'll just worry them needlessly."</p><p>I glanced around the room and confirmed that, yes, everyone else could hear this argument too. Awkward.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei opened the door and stepped into our cabin, barely glancing over his shoulder. "Yes, they do, Kurenai," he refuted calmly. No, calm was the wrong word. It was more a lazer guided focus, like being given a mission and assessing the best strategies and then just carrying it out. "Because we were too late. And chances are we'll be too late next time, too."</p><p>He looked serious and purposeful, not really like the man I knew. "They're not just Genin," he went on. "They're soldiers. And you should know that."</p><p>"Did you find out who it was?" Sasuke asked immediately, on his feet, hands balling into fists at his side.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei gave him a short nod. "They were Hidden Grass ninja. According to Rei, they were both declared missing ninja nearly six months ago for conspiring against the village. But I'm willing to bet that those records are all backdated and they were active Grass shinobi up until last night. The surviving attacker seemed under that impression, anyway."</p><p>"What does that mean?" I asked, pulling up my knees and leaning my arms over them. "Was it ordered?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei gave a rolling shrug. "Hidden Grass is pretty close to starting a civil war. There are two main factions, Grass Flower and Grass Fruit. They've been keeping it pretty low key, up until now, and it was assumed that they would manage to continue that for the duration of the Chunin Exams. It's in their best interests to keep it under wraps while all the clients are here, and while there are so many foreign powers about. The last thing they need is an external threat to go with the internal one. But it seems you panicked them, Shikako."</p><p>I felt the weight of his gaze. Not reprimanding, but… yes. He was saying it was a direct response to something I had done. I nodded.</p><p>"The Blood Prison isn't just an important resource for Hidden Grass as a whole; it's a location of strategic value in a civil war. The side that holds the prison has huge advantages over the other. So you suddenly became a rather important game piece." His eye curved into a smile, but it was somehow less than his usual expressions. A fakeness to it, like a bright sheath to cover up a blade. "They acted quickly to try and move you around, which was lucky for you because it meant they screwed it up. If they'd taken another day to plan, they might have come up with a better option."</p><p><em> Another day and I'd have had more chakra</em> , I nearly said, but it wouldn't have necessarily been true. Using so much against Gaara had seemed safe at the time, but it had been a mistake. Based on faulty assumptions. And the consequences were that I was near helpless in enemy territory. If I hadn't managed to plant that Touch Blast, I could be deeply regretting that mistake right now.</p><p>"So that's it?" Sasuke demanded sharply. "That's the end of it? They hurt her and everyone just washes their hands of it?"</p><p>"Hardly," Kakashi-sensei said. And now he slumped back into a more familiar posture, pulling out his Icha Icha. It was strangely reassuring. "There's been all kinds of shouting happening in the Kage box. Accusations flying all over the place. If you thought your little handshake stunt had shaken things up, it's nothing compared to what's going on right now. Everyone is using it as a chance to say something."</p><p>"And we don't do anything?" Sasuke persisted.</p><p>"We are doing everything we can," Kurenai-sensei said from the doorway, voice warm and reassuring. "It's a delicate situation. Not just for our treaty with Hidden Grass, but for the Chunin Exams as a whole. If people violate the sanctity of the Exams and start trying to kidnap the competitors, then the whole structure will just collapse in on itself. And then the replacement for war might turn into actual war."</p><p>Which translated to 'no, we don't do anything'.</p><p>Sasuke's gaze burned.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning was the finals. The mood was energetic and excited amongst the civilians, and hugely tense anywhere there were groups of ninja.</p><p>In our group, it was basically dead. We were holding the mood hostage and strangling it. With extreme prejudice.</p><p>We sat in the stands in near silence, alert and waiting. I was there, not because I was substantially better, but because they would announce the promotions after the final match and we all had to be there for that. I'd been piggybacked there – by Lee – no matter how much I insisted I didn't need it and bundled in blankets like I was a nana. The other groups were equally as tense and equally as locked in on themselves.</p><p>The air between us and Hidden Cloud might have caught fire if anyone had glared just a little bit harder. And the two Hidden Grass competitors had yet to show their faces.</p><p>Temari and Kankurou hovered near the edges of our group, and just before the start of the match, Haku herded the rest of his team through.</p><p>"Good morning," he said, smiling apologetically at us. "Is there room for a few more?"</p><p>Chojuro had one of the twins by each hand, his fingers wrapped loosely around a wrist so that he could easily let go and start fighting if he really had to but also so that neither of them could get lost without his knowledge. We weren't the only paranoid ones, then.</p><p>"Of course," Ino said, with a genuine smile. I wondered if this was what they'd done yesterday, as well. "It's our pleasure."</p><p>The twins were bundled into the middle of the group, with me, and Chojuro took up a sentry position at the edge.</p><p>"I'm glad to see that you're well, Shikako," Haku said.</p><p>I wished him good luck in turn and he descended down to the field.</p><p>I wished that I could have enjoyed the fight. It was a good one – hugely spectacular with two terrifyingly skilled ninja pitted against each other. It was the kind of fight I doubted I could safety witness ever again, without risking being drawn into it because it would be <em> real</em> .</p><p>Yet, I couldn't. Because there was only the sick twist of reality spoiling the lightness of the festival. All the lights and colours felt fake and the cheering was grating. Gratuitous.</p><p>It was spoilt.</p><p>"The winner of this match, and of the Hidden Grass Chunin Exams," the referee boomed. "Is Gaara of the Desert!"</p><p>The crowd roared like an ocean, like the waves battering against the shore.</p><p>Haku bowed, down on the field. He wasn't exhausted. He'd held back, hadn't committed himself totally to this fight because there was more to come. Not in the exam. But the exam wasn't real.</p><p>"We'll have a short break, to allow the judges to deliberate," the referee continued on. "And then announce the promotions!"</p><p>As if the judges hadn't been arguing about this all week. Our performances themselves were only a very small part of the decision.</p><p>All the Genin who had taken part in the Third Exam were called down to the field and lined up. I flatly refused to let anyone carry me down, and doubly flatly refused to walk slower than normal no matter how much my everything hurt. Our sensei lined up behind us, a line of serious faces watching over us. Asuma-sensei was placed directly behind me.</p><p>The Kage and village leaders filed out next, standing so they were facing the line of us.</p><p>"From the Village Hidden in the Mist," Mei Terumi said, smiling sweetly and holding out a Mist standard Chunin vest. "Chojuro."</p><p>He stepped forward to take it, bowing. And then she swooped down and pressed a kiss to his cheek. Chojuro went red, and if he'd had to speak I'd have guaranteed that he would have stuttered.</p><p>She repeated the process with Haku, who handled the affection with a little more dignity.</p><p>Chiyo barked out the names of all three of the Sand Genin, and it was Baki who actually gave them their vests. Though apparently she did throw something at Kankurou's head, then cackled incoherently, and pretended to fall asleep. That was ninja eccentrics for you.</p><p>Grass promoted Muku, but not Ryuusetsu. Hidden Cloud promoted both the ninja that had made it past the first round of the exam. Hidden Rock promoted two of theirs despite <em> neither</em> of them making it past the first round. It smelt like a throwaway concession.</p><p>Three of the minor villages ended up giving promotions – Nadeshiko, Fog and Valley.</p><p>And then it was Tsunade's turn. "Neji Hyuuga," she said. And then she called Lee. And Tenten. And just… kept going, until all nine of us had been called forward.</p><p>I accepted my Chunin vest almost numbly, falling back into line as Ino was called forward. There was no way. This had to be a joke. Surely not.</p><p>Surely so, it seemed.</p><p>All <em> nine</em> of us.</p><p>The crowd was cheering.</p><p>"Holy shit," Kiba crowed, eyes wild, and it was like a spell was broken. "All of us? No way!"</p><p>We crowded each other forward, the same exhilaration and disbelief in our faces. Lee hollered for joy and leapt onto his sensei, Chouji swept both Ino and I into a huge hug.</p><p>"Asuma-sensei!" Ino called. "Did you know? You knew!"</p><p>Asuma-sensei laughed, avoided her swiping hands. "I didn't know. Nine promotions, huh? How did you swing that, Hokage-sama?"</p><p>Tsunade smiled, stepping closer with an amused twist to her lips. "I didn't," she said. "I only wanted to promote half of them. But the Raikage wouldn't hear of it. And I quote 'get your damn plants out of these exams'. He was willing to let us dominate this exam, if it meant we couldn't keep it up for the next one."</p><p>Which was a point. If you thought about the exams in the long term purpose of advertising the village, it was better to conserve your best and brightest, using them to show off the village over a number of years rather than burning bright and burning hard.</p><p><em> My candle burns at both ends, it will not last the night, but ah my foes and oh my friends, it gives a lovely light.</em></p><p>And I didn't even care.</p><p>"Nine has to be a record," Kurenai said, a tad wistfully. "There were six at mine. And that was pretty impressive."</p><p>"It is," Tsunade agreed. "And impressive or not, we've still got a couple of hours of daylight left and we're not spending it here. Everyone get packed up, we're moving out."</p><p>We sobered up, a little, breaking out of the group of congratulations and heading for the exit. I waved at the other teams, Mist and Sand, who were celebrating in their own ways. It was sad to leave without saying anything, but we would see them again. I was sure of it.</p><p><hr /></p><p>There was an upside and a downside to travelling out of Hidden Grass.</p><p>Upside, Lee didn't get to carry me, much to his great disappointment.</p><p>Downside, this was because Gai-sensei had been volunteered for the task.</p><p>I had no chance of protesting. "Thank you, Gai-sensei," I said dutifully. "I'm very grateful."</p><p>I'd have rather walked. But apparently we were pushing the pace as fast as we could, and that didn't leave room for chakra cripples. Tsunade's words, not mine.</p><p>All complaints aside, I was hardly jostled. Gai-sensei was basically gliding like a cloud the whole way. I rested my cheek against the back of his shoulder and tried to zone out. I'd done so much sleeping over the past two days that it wasn't appealing, yet there wasn't much else to do, either.</p><p>"I know they say Nara can sleep anywhere," Kakashi-sensei said, without really looking at me. "But that's a bit much, isn't it?"</p><p>I opened my eyes long enough to glare at him, because he had been the one to volunteer Gai-sensei. "I could have walked," I grumbled half-heartedly.</p><p>"The weather <em> is</em> lovely," Kakashi-sensei agreed, not even pretending to listen to the words actually coming out of my mouth. "I got told I had to give these to you, so here you go."</p><p>He reached out, uncurled one of my hands and pressed something small and metal into them, then vanished from sight. I had to work out how to see what he'd given me without falling off and without smacking Gai-sensei in the face. Of course.</p><p>"He has the worst timing," I mumbled.</p><p>Gai-sensei chuckled. It reverberated right through him. "My Eternal Rival has a very singular approach!" he agreed. "But he has been very worried about you."</p><p>I sighed. "I know," I said. "Sensei always worries. He just pretends not to."</p><p>I shifted my weight, curled my chin into his shoulder and peered over it into my hand. Earrings. Kakashi-sensei'd given me earrings. From my clan, for my promotion. It was tradition.</p><p>"Sensei, you dweeb," I muttered. "You couldn't have given them to me before we left? Now I'm going to drop them."</p><p><hr /></p><p>So I have to apologize for the last ending. It seems everyone expected it to go in a much different direction than it really did. I really regret that, it's been totally blown up. I hope no one is too horribly disappointed. At least the update was fast?</p><p>But the exams are over, everyone is back in Konoha now. Moving on.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

We'd been rushing back to Konoha, but even the harsh pace didn't really seem to affect him any. I doubted it even registered as 'harsh'. "Gai-sensei!" he said, eagerly. "Since you are already carrying Shikako-san, should we make it a piggy back race?" He spun, to look at Tenten.</p><p>"No," she said. "No, Lee. I'm not going to-"</p><p>He bounced closer, grabbing her hands and holding them up. "Tenten," he beseeched. "It Is Training. We Must Work Together As Teammates." The capital letters dropped like stones, emphasis and earnestness.</p><p>And, I decided, if <em> I</em> had to be carried back to Konoha when I was perfectly capable of walking…</p><p>"Come on, Tenten," I wheedled from Gai-sensei's back. "It'll be fun."</p><p>"You don't know what you're saying!" she said, but it was too late. Lee had taken the faint hint of weakness as total capitulation.</p><p>I dropped my chin down on Gai-sensei's shoulder. "It's not much of a race with only two people," I mused, casually. "Does no one else think they have a chance?"</p><p>The air sizzled.</p><p>There were words that should probably never be said in a group of teenage boys. Especially not in a group of teenage boys that had just spent a week proving they were the baddest things around, no really. That was probably up there with 'I double dog dare you'.</p><p>That I held in reserve, just in case no one took the first bait.</p><p>Kiba smirked. "Oh, it's like that, is it?" he said. "Hinata! We gotta stand up for our team."</p><p>"I know what you're doing," Sasuke said flatly. He crossed his arms and scowled at me.</p><p>I widened my eyes, innocently. <em> Dare you,</em> I singsonged, in my head. He twitched. He was weakening.</p><p>Then Ino barreled into his back. "I know you can do it, Sasuke-kun," she cheered, entire countenance showing nothing but delight at roping him into this.</p><p>Sasuke staggered forwards, feet shuffling quickly to avoid landing on his face from the unexpected attack. Then he appeared to decide that if he were moving in this direction anyway…</p><p>"No one said start!" Kiba hollered, chasing after him. Lee was a blur of green vanishing after them both.</p><p>Gai-sensei zipped forward, probably nowhere near as fast as he could go but more than fast enough to catch up with the running Chunin. I clung tightly to his shoulders and laughed into the wind.</p><p>He led them on a merry chase towards the gates, just close enough to feel like they could catch up, if only they tried.</p><p>Then he slammed to a complete halt on a dime, finishing right before the gate desk and slapped his hands down on it. "First!" he roared.</p><p>Lee performed a similar feat only seconds later, a semi-frazzled Tenten half strangling him as she held on. Sasuke was maybe a step or two behind him, and Kiba trailing only a little bit further than that.</p><p>"Ah," Izumo said, managing to look only a little a taken back by the display. He didn't even ask why they were racing, probably presuming that the answers were 'Gai and Lee'. "You're back early."</p><p>"I was not fast enough!" Lee said, head held low. "I must train harder! I will sprint to the road marking ten times before the rest arrive!"</p><p>Tenten's eyes had time to widen fractionally. "Put me down first!" she shouted.</p><p>I muffled my laughter until she was out of earshot.</p><p>"ID card?" Izumo asked.</p><p>I leant forward over Gai-sensei's shoulder and dropped into his waiting hands.</p><p>"Hmm," Izumo said. "I'm not sure this is valid. It says here that you're a Genin, yet I can see that Chunin vest with my own eyes." He was clearly teasing.</p><p>I beamed at him.</p><p>"Welcome aboard, Greenie," he said, passing it back and grabbing the rest from the others. "You can call me Izumo-sempai and I'll make you do all the running around, okay?"</p><p>"Izumo-sempai," I agreed, watching as he also proceeded to hassle Sasuke – who returned the favour without missing a beat.</p><p>The rest of the group was arriving, having travelled at a more comfortable pace. I glanced over them surreptitiously but couldn't see Kakashi-sensei. I knew he was here somewhere – he <em> had</em> to be – but I'd had a really hard time actually finding him on the trip. It was kind of impressive to be avoiding someone so well in such limited space, but also kinda <em> really annoying.</em></p><p>And if I wanted to talk to him, now was going to be the last chance, because once we were in Konoha there would be so many more places for him to hide.</p><p><em> Time to bring out the big guns,</em> I decided.</p><p>"Gai-sensei," I asked, as politely as I could, because he didn't have to say yes. Even if he didn't agree to help for me, maybe he would agree to help because sensei clearly needed help with Feelings. "Can we go and talk to Kakashi-sensei?"</p><p>Gai-sensei sparkled. I was on his back, so technically I shouldn't have been able to see it, but The Smile was not bound by such mere suggestions of physics. "Most certainly!" He agreed, like he had only been waiting for me to ask. Maybe he had been. He couldn't have missed Kakashi-sensei's campaign of avoidance.</p><p>It was a disconcerting feeling of being dragged along in someone else's Body Flicker, but we rolled from place to place with an enviable smoothness, like there was no difference between them at all. And then moved again, only to find Kakashi-sensei leaning casually against a tree and reading like we hadn't just gone on a high speed chase to try and catch him.</p><p>"My Eternal Rival!" Gai-sensei said. "Your precious student wishes to speak with you."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei didn't look up from his book. "Is that so?" he asked, voice inflectionless.</p><p>I leant sideways, no longer even holding on. I could probably get down now, but I felt like I could use the extra height. This might go better if we were at eye level.</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei," I said.</p><p>He still didn't look up.</p><p>"Sen<em> sei,</em> " I tried again.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>I reach out, put one palm on either side of his face and lifted it. "Dinner at my house tonight. Six o'clock. Don't be late," I said.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei blinked at me, like that wasn't what he'd expected me to say.</p><p>Honestly, it hadn't been what I'd intended to say. But I could absolutely understand 'I don't want to talk about it' when it was shouted in my face, and had the sneaking suspicion that even 'thank you' would be going too far here.</p><p>I wiggled his face up and down, making him nod. "Yes, Shikako-chan, I will be there," I said for him.</p><p>He disengaged my hands, but gently. "I'll think about it," he said vaguely, then made an excuse and vanished.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>Gai-sensei coughed, politely, like he was interrupting something. "My Eternal Rival has a peculiar stance on punctuality," he said, "and a challenge such as the one issued only increases the chances he will, in fact, be late."</p><p>I righted myself, so I wasn't hanging out over empty air. "I know," I said. "But in order to be late he has to show up in the first place. And that's really all I want."</p><p>Gai-sensei laughed, and it had a different tone to it. Almost startled. "A canny plan indeed!"</p><p>We went back to the gate and were dismissed with the rest of the crowd. Tsunade reminded us to update our ID's for our new ranks in the next few days. We'd been let in on her authority, but our cards would definitely need to be correct before the next time we left the village.</p><p>Gai-sensei – <em> finally</em> – put me down. "How nice it is to return to Konoha!" He declared loudly. "We are safely home!"</p><p>And I might have been annoyed at having to be carried the whole way back, but I could still appreciate when people had gone out of their way to help me.</p><p>"Thank you, Gai-sensei," I said solemnly, facing him and rising up on my tippy toes so that I could press a kiss to his cheek. "You're the best."</p><p>He burst into very dramatic tears of thanks, and I slipped away into the crowd. Shikako <em> out.</em></p><p>Tenten, having rescued herself from Lee, pointed a finger straight at my forehead. "No," she said firmly.</p><p>I blinked at her. "What? He was carrying me for three days. We bonded." It had been inescapable. Literally.</p><p>"I know what happens to people who bond with Gai-sensei," she said, still stern. "You're already wearing too much green. There isn't far to go."</p><p>I laughed. "Whatever you say."</p><p>We split, probably all equally relieved to be going home. I walked with Ino, enjoying the quiet, enjoying the chance <em> to</em> walk and stretch and generally move about under my own power.</p><p>"You almost died, you know," Ino said, gazing down the road without really seeming to see it. Her tone was conversational, light. Completely at odds with the weight of the words.</p><p>I watched a sparrow take flight from a tree branch, swoop low across the grass in a graceful arc, and return with a worm clamped in its beak. "I was trying not to think about that," I said. "Besides, there's a lot of ground in an 'almost'."</p><p>"Not this one," she said, and it was the first crack I had seen in her composure all week.</p><p>It rippled through me like an earthquake, shaking lose the cracks of my own, shining light into dark corners where things were supposed to hide. "Ino," I said, an edge of desperation leaking into my voice faster than I could block it out. "I can't-"</p><p><em> I can't do this.</em> I bit the words off, kept them behind my teeth and struggled not to say them. <em> I </em> can'tdo it<em> , Ino</em> .</p><p>I <em> couldn't</em> . Couldn't talk about something like this without shining that light into darkness, revealing all those hidden and ugly places. Couldn't talk about <em> I had nearly died</em> without thinking about the truth of it. And it scared me, of course it did. That was the heart of it, wasn't it? Fear like that was a wild animal, something you had to circle around carefully, had to approach from oblique angles, edge your way closer while pretending you weren't.</p><p>People pushed and pushed and the animal only grew larger and angrier, more frightening and dangerous, because it was wild and it was scared and it wanted to defend itself. It needed to be calmed and gentled, before it could be dealt with.</p><p>Didn't she know, how fragile my façade was? She had to know. She'd seen behind it more than once. Seen the cracks in it and how it shook and how paper thin the confidence I had in it was. How stretched and how exhausted and how much energy it took to maintain the whole thing. She had to know.</p><p>I didn't have the resources to reassure her. Not on this. I <em> couldn't-</em></p><p>It wasn't <em> fair.</em> Why did I always have to be the one that was strong?</p><p>I swallowed the words down, bitter and chalky. "Are you okay, Ino?" I asked, instead.</p><p>Ino was a young girl and she'd nearly had a friend die in her arms. If I took myself out of the equation, if it wasn't <em> me</em> , then… If it had been Sakura, then I would have helped her. Of course I would have. It was a terrifying thing, and it had upset her. She needed someone to ask if she was okay.</p><p>Maybe Ino's façade was just as thin as mine. Maybe I had been the one who hadn't seen. She had been happy and cheerful all the way home, friendly and engaging, and maybe that took all her effort. We hadn't had any privacy to talk about things like this, and it wasn't something you brought up in a group. Not these things.</p><p>It wasn't fair. No. But nothing ever was. And I was the one that was strong, that helped them when they needed it, because I had <em> chosen to be.</em> I had picked up that burden and now I had to carry it.</p><p>'I can't' meant nothing.</p><p>"Are you okay?" I asked, again. There were no extra reserves of emotional energy, waiting to be discovered, here. But Ino deserved what I had left. What little pieces I could scrape together and give her.</p><p>"Not really," she said, eyes sad. "But… I'm going to talk to dad about it, okay?"</p><p>I felt a flash of relief. And then shame, because I shouldn't have been relieved that she didn't need me. But I was; I was relieved like it was a problem that I had avoided being dragged into.</p><p>"Okay," I parroted back to her, hoping she couldn't see it, couldn't see through me.</p><p>"And when I'm done," Ino went on and her eyes were searching mine, like she could, "you could come and talk to me. If you wanted."</p><p>"Sure," I agreed, looking away. I raised my hand and bid her farewell, walking on towards home.</p><p>Mum was the only one home, so while I greeted her warmly, I also didn't feel too bad about fleeing to my room to unpack and to the bathroom to shower forever. A week later and I was still brushing sand out of my hair.</p><p>These were the things no one ever warned you about.</p><p>But it wasn't fair to be completely antisocial either, when I'd been gone so long, so afterwards I took my notebooks and parked myself on the couch in the living room instead of staying in my room.</p><p>"What are you working on?" Mum asked, spying the reams of paper I brought downstairs with me.</p><p>"It's a kind of magnifying glass for seals," I said. "Maybe a microscope?" There were a lot of seals I could have been working on – my air barrier had turned out to be total crap and needed to be reworked from scratch, for example – but this was something that I could do inside without needing to 'test' anything, because it was still in the ideas phase. I'd only seen the expansion seal in use once, and while I'd been paying strict attention, it didn't give me a lot to go off.</p><p>Shikamaru was the first one to come home, calling out a lethargic 'tadaima' just after five.</p><p>I sat up. "Okaeri," I called back.</p><p>He hung his vest up, and touched the one that was already resting there. Mine. "Congrats," he said with a small smile.</p><p>I smiled back, a slowly dawning thing. And until right at that moment, I hadn't realized I was worried about his reaction. That it mattered, good or bad, what he thought about my promotion. That I'd wanted him to be happy about it, but had been worried he wouldn't be. That I hadn't <em> truly</em> known what he would say until he had said it.</p><p>"Thanks," I said, voice just a touch too low to be perfectly natural. I coughed, clearing it. "Ino and Chouji were also promoted," I went on, brightly. "Actually, all nine of us made it. Kurenai-sensei said that was probably a record."</p><p>He looked briefly surprised. "Sounds like it," he agreed coming over to flop down next to me. He stretched, joints clicking. "Was it different to the Konoha Exams?"</p><p>"A bit," I said, launching into an explanation of how it had all been set up.</p><p>In turn, I learnt that Shikamaru had spent the past few weeks working in the tower – mostly in the logistics and supply department. It was an interesting fit, but an important field to have a strong basis in if you were ever going to be ordering troops around on a large scale. Which wasn't to say that they were grooming Shikamaru to take over from Dad, but you'd have to be an idiot not to consider it.</p><p>Sasuke arrived and we were all sitting down to eat before Dad came home, which wasn't actually a good sign in terms of how his talk with Tsunade had gone.</p><p>"Dad!" I scrambled away from the table and towards him. He caught me easily, lifting me into a hug with terrific ease.</p><p>I peered over his shoulder at the person who had arrived with him. "Kakashi-sensei," I admonished. "You're late!" I wiggled an arm free and tapped him on the nose.</p><p>He drew back with the <em> exact same</em> huffy and offended expression that Akamaru would have worn.</p><p>I couldn't stop the giggles, burying them into Dad's shoulder. "Trouble," he sighed fondly at me.</p><p>And I just desperately wanted to keep this moment. Just freeze time here for a bit, just live in a second where all my people were here and happy. When we were warm and fed and unhurt. Before the truth spilled out once more and darkness intruded with anger and arguments.</p><p>But how did that poem go? <em> Nothing gold can stay.</em></p><p>I folded the moment up like it was a treasured photograph and tucked it away. It would keep. It would have always happened. I would always have it to look back on.</p><p>Then I let go and stepped back. "Foods getting cold," I said, focusing on the practical concerns. "You should eat."</p><p>"Congratulations on your promotion," Dad said, setting me down. He stepped past the table and set a hand on Sasuke's shoulder as he went. "Both of you."</p><p>"Who'd you fight?" Shikamaru asked idly, because that wasn't something I had covered earlier. I'd mostly talked about the first two Exams, because they were the ones that were different. A tournament was a tournament.</p><p>"Gaara," I said, even though we'd had a couple of rounds. "We both lost to Gaara."</p><p>Sasuke jabbed his chopsticks in my direction. "I'd have done better if she hadn't screwed me over," he complained.</p><p>"I kinda did," I said, unable to deny it. "But thems the breaks."</p><p>"Oh?" Shikamaru said, looking interested. "How so?"</p><p>Sasuke glanced at him, but appeared to decide that telling the story wasn't going to utterly humiliate himself. "She turned the entire arena into a desert," he said. "That's like, the worst place to pick a fight with him."</p><p>"<em> I</em> didn't turn it into a desert," I argued. "Gaara did. So, don't say it like that."</p><p>"Gaara did when he was fighting you," Sasuke refuted. "Your fault."</p><p>"You fought <em> Gaara?</em> " Shikamaru asked, sounding only mildly strangled. "And you didn't forfeit?"</p><p>"He was playing nice," I reassured him. "I didn't even get so much as a graze."</p><p>"I bet he wished <em> you</em> were playing nice," Sasuke said.</p><p>"I didn't so much as graze him, either," I said, tartly, in return. "I was playing plenty nice." Like that had been a deliberate choice on my part and not simply because I couldn't. But whatever.</p><p>But the conversation shifted onwards, like I knew it was always going to.</p><p>Or rather, it ground to a stuttering, teetering halt when Dad brought up the kidnapping. Not even in so many words, just a reference to the fact that Konoha was now in a bit of a tricky political situation.</p><p>"What?" Mum asked, confused. "Did something happen?"</p><p>Dad raised an eyebrow at me, not quite admonition but not far off, either.</p><p>"I didn't want to have to say it twice," I explained, appetite gone but taking a bite of dinner so that I could look nonchalant. "There was an attempted kidnapping near the end of the exam."</p><p>The lack of information in the statement probably gave away more than it hid. Why not say the name, if it were anyone else? Why not say 'Hidden Cloud tried to take Hinata'? There was no reason.</p><p>"Who was it?" Shikamaru asked, flatly.</p><p>"Hidden Grass," I said, even though that wasn't what he was asking and I knew it. I didn't fool myself into thinking he didn't tuck the information away though.</p><p>"<em> Shikako</em> ."</p><p>"They tried to take me," I said, relenting instead of trying to talk around the subject more. "I got away; they didn't get far. But Hidden Grass pretended they were missing ninja and pretty much denied all knowledge of events."</p><p>"You got away?" Shikamaru repeated, agitated. "What does that even mean?" He looked at Dad, then back to me, accusing.</p><p>"It means I blew his fucking head off, what do you think it means?" I snapped.</p><p>There was a brief, startled pause. Wary. That was not a normal Shikako reaction.</p><p>I breathed. Calm. Calm was good.</p><p>"It's fine, okay?" I said, voice descending back into a normal range, throttling the inexplicable burst of anger. It had come out of nowhere. I hadn't been prepared for that. "I got away. I got myself away. There's no need to get all upset about it."</p><p>Shikamaru made a cut off sound. "No need to- Dammit, Shikako! You think this is about me being <em> upset?</em> "</p><p>I dimly noted that Kakashi-sensei was gone. There was a clean plate on the table, but absolutely no other evidence that he had ever been here. Fine, whatever. Sasuke looked horribly awkward, like he didn't want to be witnessing this. Me either.</p><p>"Shikako," Dad said, cutting into the argument before it could really take off. "Your brother is just worried about you. Shikamaru; Your sister made it home safely. Shouting at each other isn't going to change those facts."</p><p>I simmered back down. I didn't <em> want</em> to argue. I hated arguing. And I really, really hated arguing with family. I felt awful now, a different kind of sick twisting adrenaline to that from a normal fight.</p><p>"Yeah well," Shikamaru said, mulishly, leaning back in his seat, "if it was so dangerous maybe she shouldn't have gone in the first place."</p><p>And that. That was <em> it.</em></p><p>"It's not your <em> choice!</em> " I exploded, standing up and sending my chair skidding backwards. My hand caught on my cup and knocked it clear off the table.</p><p>It hit the floor and shattered.</p><p>The moment trembled, like a knife balanced on its edge. It could have come back from there, the tension could have unraveled, made us feel foolish and awkward. But it didn't.</p><p>"Well maybe if you cared I wouldn't have to!" Shikamaru shot back, standing up himself.</p><p>"<em> Life is dangerous!</em> " I screamed at him, voice cracking. It was all gone now, all boiling up, shaping itself into a weapon to be launched at him. To cut. "You can do nothing and <em> still die.</em> I'm trying to keep us alive! What the hell do you want from me?!"</p><p>"You're <em> trying?</em> " he shot back, not quite as uncontrolled as me, but just as pointed. Just as sharp. "Do you even really <em> care?</em> You're injured a hell of a lot for someone who's 'trying'."</p><p>My face twisted. My skin was white hot from the inside, like I was burning up with rage. I was lightheaded with it, emptied out, filled with light. My muscles were pulled tight, taunt and screaming.</p><p>I jerked my plate aside. Threw it to the ground just so it would smash. I wanted to break something. Anything. Just so it would be ruined.</p><p>"Stop it!" Mum shouted. "What are you doing? Stop this right now! That's not how you talk to your family."</p><p>"Yoshino-" Dad started, but she kept going, talking over him. Talking over us.</p><p>The sounds, the noise, it was too much. My teeth ground together; furious, futile anger. It had been cut off, built up then stemmed. Prevented from releasing. I wanted to throw things. To make something smash. To punch Shikamaru in his <em> stupid fucking face</em> . To shout and scream and say something that really made him <em> hurt, </em> that wiggled through all his stupid arguments at hit where it would wound<em> .</em></p><p>I was shaking with it.</p><p>And.</p><p>And he just left. Glared at me with the same impotent, bottled up frustration and stalked outside. Slammed the door behind him. Was gone.</p><p>I muffled my screaming in my throat. Kicked the chair aside with violence only barely restrained and stomped jerkily into the living room.</p><p>And then it crashed. I stood there, trembling and my white hot anger burnt out, taking everything with it and leaving behind only the ash of exhaustion. I was hollowed out, destroyed, misery blooming in my chest and filling all the empty spaces.</p><p>I collapsed onto the couch.</p><p>Voices in the other room peaked and faded. I didn't care. There was the clicking of pottery shards being picked up, sweeping and mopping. The door opened and shut. Dad went outside.</p><p>I didn't even care.</p><p>Sasuke hovered in my vision. I flatly refused to track him, letting my eyes stayed blurred and unfocused. I wasn't crying. There was nothing there – nothing to cry with or about. Just nothing.</p><p>"Shikako?" He said, tentatively, then slightly more worried and panicked. Fingers touched my neck, counted the slow beats of my pulse. "Yoshino-san?!"</p><p>I still refused to move. The body was just a body. I was something else. Someone else. Somewhere else.</p><p>Mum smoothed my hair back and sighed. "She's just sulking," she said. "Come on, dear. I'm sorry you had to see that. I'll pack you the leftovers to take home, okay?"</p><p><em> Sulking.</em> Like that was all I was doing. Like it was that simple. Like everything hadn't been taken out of the world, all the colour and meaning and reason. Like I had any reason to put forth the effort of pretending to be a person any longer.</p><p>I stayed like that, still and listless, as time ran like watercolours around me, gone soft and blurry.</p><p>Dad came back. I felt Shikamaru's chakra go upstairs, brushing past me.</p><p>"Bed time," he suggested to me, like it mattered where I was.</p><p>I didn't react. Didn't care. Couldn't be bothered.</p><p>Eventually, when the house was dark and quiet, he picked me up and carried me upstairs, like I was a child again. There had been days like this, back at the beginning, when it had all been too much to be here and a child and alive and I had just… gone quiet for a while.</p><p>I didn't sleep, just lay there in that blank state, feeling the sleeping hum of my family's chakra, listening to the wind in the trees.</p><p>Shikamaru woke and went downstairs. There was the click, click of lights being turned on. The pipes groaned as the kitchen tap dispensed water. He didn't come back up.</p><p>I rolled the idea of going downstairs over in my head. Of talking to him.</p><p>Thought about it for a long, long time.</p><p>Dad's chakra stirred in the room along the hall. He got up, went downstairs, no footsteps in the hallway to mark his passing.</p><p>And, beneath the layers and layers of apathy, was a spark of curiosity. Maybe not even curiosity, maybe suspicion, maybe paranoia.</p><p>I fed the smallest, barest trace of chakra into my ears.</p><p>There was the click of shogi tiles on the board. Too fast to be playing, so they were only just setting up.</p><p>"-dangerous," Dad was saying, voice mild. It was muffled, barely audible to me. "They were taking reasonable precautions. She was feet away from a Jounin."</p><p>So they <em> were</em> talking about me. My stomach twisted, sour acid.</p><p>"I'm not- I wasn't blaming her," Shikamaru said. "But it happened. And it always seems to happen to her. And she just doesn't care."</p><p>There was a click, shogi on wood.</p><p>"Do you really think that?" Dad asked, non-judgmental.</p><p>"You heard her," Shikamaru said. "'No need to get <em> upset'</em> ." He sounded fairly upset for someone who had protested he wasn't.</p><p>"You're worried about her," Dad said.</p><p>"Of course I am," Shikamaru retorted, immediately.</p><p>"And she's worried about you," Dad went on, like it was leading somewhere.</p><p><em> Of course I was,</em> I thought, with a kernel of irritation buried somewhere beneath the blanket of apathy.</p><p>"She doesn't care," Shikamaru said, instead. His shogi piece clicked down with force.</p><p>"She's worried about you," Dad repeated patiently. "And she doesn't want to worry you more. So she pretends that none of it is important so you don't <em> get</em> worried. But that only makes you more so, because you think she doesn't care. So she tries harder to convince you that it doesn't matter. The two of you are spiraling off of each other and only making the situation worse."</p><p>There was a long silence.</p><p>I turned his explanation over in my head. I couldn't fix what made Shikamaru upset. But I had been trying not to add to it. And it had just… never worked.</p><p>"Has she talked to you?" Shikamaru asked suddenly.</p><p>Dad was silent. Considering. "Sometimes when you push, you only make things worse," he said. "You have to let someone decide they need you, first."</p><p>"She hasn't," Shikamaru deduced, latching on to the only fact he cared about, bitterly. "She won't listen to me. But she'd have to listen to you. If you told her not to go."</p><p>I breathed. Just. In and out. In and out.</p><p>"Do you really think so, Shikamaru?" Dad asked, still so, so calm. "That if I gave an order, she would stop?"</p><p>"She would have to," Shikamaru argued. "She wouldn't have a choice."</p><p>"Yes, she would," Dad said, gently. "And that choice would be listen, or continue on without us. We would stop being support and become obstacles in her way. And that is not a choice that you want to force your sister to make."</p><p>"Why?" Shikamaru asked, voice cracking. Maybe he saw it. Maybe he saw the choice that I would be forced to make, in all its terrible glory. "What's so <em> important</em> to her?"</p><p>Dad clicked a shogi piece down. "I don't know," he said. "But she's scared, don't you see that?"</p><p>Shikamaru coughed, a wet sound, like he was trying not to cry. "I don't want her to be scared," he said. "I just want her to be safe."</p><p>I stopped listening, and rolled over to stare at my wall. There were photographs there, a haphazard collage of better days.</p><p>It was a long night.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I didn't actively avoid Shikamaru the next morning. I just… didn't get up until after he'd left.</p><p>Okay, I avoided him. Fine.</p><p>I deserved one day off, didn't I?</p><p>I spent the morning in my room, copying out a certain set of papers that I hadn't had the privacy to touch before and on my registration paperwork.</p><p>I took it to the tower, mutely handing it over to Iruka-sensei when I spotted him behind the missions desk. He flicked through it, congratulating me on my promotion, and I summoned up enough grace and manners to murmur polite thanks to him.</p><p>"I think we have something for you," he said, slightly distracted. "Just hold on a moment, would you?"</p><p>Maybe I didn't get a day off, after all. I waited, watching the sky out the window.</p><p>"It's a request from the Sensory Squad," Iruka-sensei said, giving me a scroll.</p><p>I blinked slowly at him. My understanding was like molasses, slow and viscous. "The Sensory Squad?"</p><p>The name was a little misleading. The Sensory Squad wasn't a <em> squad</em> meaning a ninja team. It wasn't even a division or department. It was more like… a registrar of shinobi with particular extra or super-sensory abilities. It mostly existed to track and train particular abilities so that when a mission put in a request for a sensor or a tracker of some kind, someone knew who to send.</p><p>"I think they're doing the testing of the new crop of Chunin," Iruka-sensei explained. "Team Eight has all been requested, and Ino and Sasuke as well." He smiled. "It's a year of talent."</p><p>It made sense.</p><p>I checked the scroll, which had a meeting time set for later that afternoon. Great.</p><p>"Thank you, Iruka-sensei," I said, forcing a smile onto my lips. "Uh, did you need help with anything? I could take messages?"</p><p>It was a weak gambit, anyway, and I was mostly relieved when he brushed me off. I couldn't just walk up to Tsunade's office and hand her the folder I'd received from Gaara. As a new Chunin I'd just never get that far. And if I tried to make an appointment, I'd be asked <em> why.</em> Which, classified intelligence; I couldn't say <em> why.</em> I could always give it to Dad at home but I was… reluctant.</p><p>I wanted home to be home. I wanted to keep a little bit of separation, where I could. So that I could have somewhere to go, when I wanted to leave things behind.</p><p>Still. Unless things drastically changed now that I was a Chunin, I sort of expected I would see her before too long.</p><p>I picked up takeaways for lunch and went to Sasuke's house.</p><p>He opened the door, face falling into an expression of relief. "Hey," he said, stepping back to let me inside. His mission pack was open, stuff spilled out onto the floor and clearly in the process of being cleaned and organized. I stepped over a pile of laundry and shuffled off my shoes. "You okay?"</p><p>"Fine," I said, setting the food down on the table. "Did you get a request from the Sensory Squad for this afternoon?"</p><p>He was still watching me, but grabbed two sets of chopsticks out of a kitchen drawer. "Yeah, doesn't sound like it's much." He shrugged. "More training, I guess."</p><p>We kicked around until it was time, then headed over to the training fields. Team Eight was already there, with Neji and surprisingly Lee.</p><p><em> Really?</em> I squinted at him, but didn't ask.</p><p>Ino arrived shortly after us, shortly before Tsume Inuzuka strolled into the training field with three Chunin at her back. Tsume was the uncontested head of the Sensory Squad, as well as Konoha's Tracking Team, on top of running the Inuzuka Clan, the Inuzuka Clinic and raising two kids by herself. I had no idea how she ever found the time.</p><p>"Alright, brats," she said. Then paused and looked at Lee. "Why are you here?"</p><p>Lee stepped forward, face eager and eyes bright. "Please allow me to also take your test!" he said, with marked enthusiasm. Neji gave the stoic impression of being completely embarrassed by him.</p><p>Tsume stared. "Do you have <em> any</em> notable super-sensory abilities?" she asked.</p><p>"No!" Lee said. "I do not!"</p><p>There was a series of exchanged looks. "Okay, fine," Tsume said, shaking her head in bemusement. "Test away. Let's see how you do. Now where were we?" She took a clipboard from one of her assistants. "Alright. Brats. You're all – except him – listed as having abilities or blood limits that qualify you for the Sensory Squad. We're going to run you through a battery of testing, covering all bases, to see if we can quantify and qualify what those abilities are."</p><p>She broke us up into three rough groups; with Sasuke and the Hyuuga into one; Shino, Ino and I into another; and Kiba and Lee into the third. Sort of ability based, if you thought about it broadly.</p><p>Tsume put herself in charge of ours. Then she smirked at me. It was honestly a little intimidating. "Well, let's see if you're half as good as the Hatake brat has been trying to convince me you are."</p><p>The testing was alternatively easy and <em> completely fucking impossible.</em> The chakra sensing stuff was no problem. I could breeze through it in my sleep. But when Tsume said 'all bases' she really meant it, because she put us through the same kind of scent tracking stuff the other Chunin were running Kiba through.</p><p>I could barely smell a flower if you stuck it under my face on a good day. Scent was not a sense I had anything 'extra' in. It just was not going to work. Or the hearing tests. Or the sight tests. Some of them I did okay in, because it was really hard to cancel out the sense crossover for chakra sensing, but it was obvious what was going on. I knew where a person was, not because I could see them but because I could sense them unless they were really good at hiding their chakra or I was otherwise really distracted.</p><p>The three of us had a bit of a competitive edge to the testing; Ino did better than me at some and worse than me at others, and Shino used completely different methods to get the same results. But it was interesting to watch them in action, to find out the kind of things that they could do.</p><p>Hell, I managed to find out new things <em> I</em> could do, which surprised me.</p><p>"Kuromaru hid a ball somewhere in the training field," Tsume said, splitting us up individually to different fields for one of the 'tracking' tasks. "Find it."</p><p>I could find where Kuromaru was right now, but that was less than useless because we wanted to know where he had <em> been.</em> Which was what scent tracking was perfect for – not just spatial locations, but temporal ones. The Hyuuga would be able to find it with their Byakugan, but I didn't have that either.</p><p>I closed my eyes and <em> focused.</em> Listened to the chakra. Felt Kuromaru, where he was now, what his chakra was. Felt the other chakra, of all the other ninja moving about. Felt residual dissipating energy from whoever had used the training field before us – there'd been an earth jutsu raised over there and it was still disintegrating slowly. Breathed and listened and sorted through as many impressions as I could, identifying and cataloging them.</p><p>Like trying to sort through a desert with a tea strainer.</p><p>But maybe?</p><p>I made a wobbling, vague line into the trees, and walked up one. Wedged in the branches there was a bright red ball. It wasn't hidden, really, but I wouldn't have just <em> seen</em> it, either.</p><p>Tsume didn't <em> exactly</em> look impressed, but there was something that might have been surprise.</p><p>"He used chakra to climb the tree," I said, just short of triumphant. "It sank into the bark. I guessed the ball would be nearby."</p><p>Not fool proof, clearly. He could have jumped, or it could have been a false trail. Or other things. But, I'd managed to track down residual low level chakra emissions so I was feeling pretty damn pleased with myself.</p><p>It was late when we were finished, after a few solid hours of exertion. But it was a good kind of exertion, of challenges to be faced and overcome – a test where failure in some areas was expected and unavoidable.</p><p>"Not bad," Tsume said, going over the results. "I'm almost impressed. Rock Lee… that was a solid attempt. The best results I've seen from a shinobi with no explicit abilities or training in any of these areas. You've got solid Chunin level perception. You're dismissed."</p><p>Which might have felt like a bit of brush off, but he had just completed a very specialized testing while being completely unqualified for it, so was actually pretty good. He seemed happy enough with the results anyway, giving profuse thanks.</p><p>Tsume shook her head. "The rest of you can come with me. We'll sort the details out at the tower."</p><p>Which meant paperwork. I wasn't wrong. There was a lot of very complicated and very involved paperwork involved with it, in order to record an accurate summation of abilities. Also very classified, because it was <em> an accurate summation of abilities.</em> We had a whole room reserved to ourselves while we did it, and the Sensory Squad ninja helpfully walked us step by step through which boxes to tick or not.</p><p>"What?" Tsume said, unhappily, when one of the tower ninja scurried up to her with a folder. "What do you mean 'reserved'?"</p><p>I ticked another box and tried not to look like I was obviously listening in. Kiba smirked at me from across the table. Yeah, okay, we were <em> all</em> listening in.</p><p>"Okay, fine," she barked. "You lot keep filling that in. Nara, you're with me."</p><p>I scrambled out of my seat obediently. "Okay?" I offered. Not what I had expected.</p><p>"You're in trouble," Kiba singsonged, under his breath.</p><p>His mother slapped him around the ears with the file. I caught sight of my name on it. "Bring your paperwork," she said. "We have to go and fight Research and Development."</p><p>I blinked, bemused. "Okay?" I repeated, no more enlightened. I hoped she wasn't serious.</p><p>Tsume Inuzuka seemed, somehow, wilder in the halls of the tower than she had in the forests and training fields. She was more noticeable as she strode through the halls, lipstick smirk firmly in place and spikey hair swishing around her face.</p><p>People got out of her way.</p><p>I scampered along behind her, having basically no idea what was going on. We wound through the corridors, until we reached a particular set of offices. The first door opened into a nearly empty open plan office, with a few more secure rooms around the sides. There was a barred door plastered with 'no entry' notices towards the end, but Tsume barreled onwards and rapped her knuckles roughly against the largest of the rooms.</p><p>"Oi, Tamashiro," she barked. "What's the big idea?"</p><p>The man inside looked up from his desk, puzzled but not surprised. Vaguely irritated. "Inuzuka, are you lost? Or perhaps you'd like us to build you something that can do your job better than you?"</p><p><em> Oooh</em> . Without moving, I tried to discretely shuffle even further behind Tsume.</p><p>"You could try for a hundred years and you wouldn't even get close," she shot back, and slapped the file down on his desk. The paper ruffled with the displaced air, a few sad pieces drifting to the floor.</p><p>His face tightened in annoyance. He picked up the file, flickered through it. "Yes, a promising recruit. And?"</p><p>"And?" Tsume barked. "She's my recruit. Prime sensor material. <em> This</em> ," she jabbed at something on the paper, "has no meaning."</p><p>"Sensor?" He repeated, indignantly. "She's trained in seals by <em> Jiraiya</em> ! That's far more important. Think of the things she could create!"</p><p>Ah. Well. Now I saw it. And, this was not something I wanted to be in the middle of. Or something I wanted to be happening at all.</p><p>"She can sense hour old chakra emissions! Do you have any idea what the tracking team could do with that?" Tsume countered, looming over the desk.</p><p>Tamashiro made a dismissive noise. "We put in the request first."</p><p>Tsume looked disdainful. "There is no 'first come, first served' rule in regards to shinobi. It depends on the best fit of their abilities."</p><p>"Which is here," Tamashiro said.</p><p>"Which is in the Sensory Squad," she corrected.</p><p>They glared at each other.</p><p>I pretended that I was part of the wall and unnoticeable.</p><p>"Take it up with the Hokage," Tamashiro suggested, looking away, but with the air of someone who thought he'd won the war despite surrendering the battle.</p><p>Tsume snatched the folder back. "Fine," she said. "I will." She spun, put a hand between my shoulders and shoved me gently out the door.</p><p>Tamashiro scrambled out from behind his desk. "What?" He trailed after us, going from confident to slightly worried as Tsume rolled on right up to the Hokage's office like a steamroller.</p><p>"What is it?" Tsunade barked after the secretary had given us the go head to enter. "I'd like to go home at some point, too."</p><p>"Apologies," Tamashiro said, bowing nervously. "It's only that-"</p><p>Tsume shoved me into the room, hand still on the neck of my jacket. I felt rather like a naughty puppy and I hadn't even done anything wrong.</p><p>Tsunade looked at me and sighed. "Okay. What is it?"</p><p>"I'm signing her into the Sensory Squad," Tsume said bluntly. "She's nearly as good a sensor as Tonbo."</p><p>Tamashiro squawked. "She belongs in R&amp;D," he protested, though to Tsume and not to the Hokage. "We claimed her first!"</p><p>And then they started talking over each other, each presenting reasons why Tsunade should listen to them.</p><p>Tsunade looked steadily less impressed. And she hadn't started off very happy.</p><p>"Enough!" she cut in. "For pity's sake, Nara, just pick one."</p><p>Tsume smoothed my jacket collar out, motherly. "We're prepared to offer you a Special Jounin position," she said.</p><p>I blinked, taken aback. That was completely and totally unexpected.</p><p>Tamashiro spluttered and looked at the Hokage like she would call it cheating.</p><p>"Thank you, Tsume-sama," I said. "I'd be honoured to become part of the Sensory Squad." And then because I didn't actually want to make enemies, I nodded at the man who was probably the head of R&amp;D. "Thank you, sir, but I'm already part of the Nara R&amp;D. It would be a conflict of interest."</p><p>He waved that off, grumbling that I wasn't the only one who would have been in both, but didn't challenge the conclusion. Thankfully. I felt like I had <em> very narrowly</em> avoided a terrible thing.</p><p>R&amp;D was most adamantly <em> not</em> field shinobi. Research and Development. And fine, I liked research, I did a lot of it, but only because it helped further my abilities where I needed them. I didn't <em> want</em> to be stuck in the office all the time, working to someone else's schedule.</p><p>And it would have been much, much harder to decline if Tsume hadn't stood here and said she wanted me instead. Even without the promotion, I would have picked the Sensory Squad.</p><p>The promotion was just a bonus. Sort of. Special Jounin was an odd position. It meant you were an expert – or <em> the</em> expert in some cases – in a particular field. It was clearly and undeniably above Chunin. And yet, it was so much harder to make the jump from Special Jounin to Jounin than it was for a skilled shinobi to go from Chunin to Jounin. It was a dead end, almost.</p><p>You got pigeonholed and it was really hard to move out of. You'd have to show Jounin class skills in a lot of fields that were very disparate to your original specialization in order to even be considered for Jounin.</p><p>But I didn't consider sensing to be my greatest skill. I'd have been much, much warier about taking a promotion in sealing.</p><p>"Congratulations," Tsunade said dryly. "That might be one of the fastest promotion turnarounds I've seen."</p><p>I bowed. "Thank you, Tsunade-sama. Uhm. Could I have a word with you?"</p><p>I nearly cringed at asking but this was the nearest thing to a perfect opportunity that I was going to get, really.</p><p>She waved Tsume off, who told me to meet her back downstairs when I was done. The door shut with finality behind her.</p><p>My stomach swooped, low and full of nerves. If this went wrong, I could be in <em> a whole lot of trouble.</em></p><p>But I had to do it. This wasn't something I could sit on. I'd always promised myself that when I had actual, solid, confirmable evidence… I would act on it. And if I didn't, then I'd been lying to myself, and I'd been lying about why I'd never acted on other things.</p><p>And I couldn't.</p><p>Tsunade leant back in her chair and observed me. That was equally nerve wracking, in its own way. This had been a hell of a day.</p><p>I rolled the sleeve of my jacket up. "Uhm. It's a storage seal," I said, tilting my arm so she could see it and confirm. It would be really rude (and, yknow, possibly threatening) to activate a seal without some kind of acknowledgement.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>I pressed chakra into it and withdrew the file. I put it down on her desk and withdrew, stepping back and to attention. My fingers clasped behind my back, so they wouldn't fidget or tremble. My eyes stared out at the village over her shoulder.</p><p>She opened the file. She closed the file.</p><p>"And what," the Hokage said. "Is this?"</p><p>I coughed, clearing my throat. "Jiraiya-sama," my voice still wobbled alarmingly. I tried again. "Jiraiya-sama was looking into them for Naruto."</p><p>"<em> He</em> was," she agreed, which didn't seem to agree that that meant I should also have been. "And where did you get it from?"</p><p>My palms were cold and wet with sweat. "An… informant?" I tried.</p><p>She sighed and rubbed her temples with one hand, the other still pinning the file flat to the desk. "Did you know," she said, tone measured and even. "I received a hawk from Hidden Sand today. They've elected a new Kazekage. Do you know who it might be?"</p><p>"Gaara?" I offered, about ninety percent sure that I was right. Mostly. Something might have gone wrong.</p><p>But she nodded. "Gaara of the Desert is the Fifth Kazekage. So. I'm not going to ask where you got this. I want to maintain a <em> small smidgen</em> of plausible deniability."</p><p>Which… made sense. If Konoha was asking for, and being denied, this information through diplomatic channels, it would look very strange that we had it anyway. And it was easy to work out where I had got it because I'd only been in contact with three Hidden Sand ninja – if it wasn't <em> the Kazekage</em> then it was <em> the Kazekage's siblings.</em> Any of those options could be equally bad.</p><p>"But I am going to ask you three questions," she went on.</p><p>My stomach went back to swooping. I linked my fingers together, even tighter.</p><p>"Did you promise anything in return for this information?" she asked.</p><p>"No," I said, utterly relieved that I could answer that question.</p><p>"What did you say to <em> get</em> this information?"</p><p>I swallowed. "I said," I started. "I said that it would help Naruto. That he was a threat to Naruto. Specifically because Naruto was a Jinchuriki." It… wasn't a lie. But even then it was verging on the limit of the things in which I should have shared with an ally.</p><p>But the information was, conversely, more trustworthy because it wasn't <em> free.</em> It had been paid for with a warning and given in gratitude as well as friendship. And if Tsunade thought that it had been bargained, rather than a gift unlooked for… well.</p><p>"Have you shown anyone this information?"</p><p>"No," I said, relieved to move on. "If I couldn't give it to you, I was going to give it to Dad. Or Kakashi-sensei. I thought they would both know?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei did, I knew, because he'd been the one that Jiraiya had been telling in the first place. Dad was the Jounin Commander. And both had better reasons to be bringing it to Tsunade's attention than I did.</p><p>I just… hadn't wanted to have this conversation with them. If they were disappointed, it would have hurt more.</p><p>She was silent for a long, long moment. I watched the sun go down over the village.</p><p>"If you're going to do this," Tsunade said, breaking the spell. "You're going to learn to do it properly. I'm assigning you to the Intelligence Division for a three month rotation – on top of whatever duties you have for the Sensory Squad. Maybe it'll keep you out of trouble if you're busy."</p><p>I bowed, muscles weak with sudden relief. "Thank you, Hokage-sama," I said, fervently.</p><p>She huffed, sounding more amused than before. "And Hatake said that <em> Naruto</em> was Konoha's most surprising ninja."</p><p>"I'm not even close, Hokage-sama," I assured her.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sensory Squad Arc: Chapter 99</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Links still aren't working, but all the fanart can either be found on my deviantart (Silver-Queen), on the tumblr (dosbysilverqueen) or on the DOS Chapter Guide site. Don't forget the Forum, either.</p><p>ImpressedAnon- Cause of death has never been mentioned, but it would have been something 'accidental' or otherwise unexpected. It didn't leave lingering associations like the RR drowning victim, so it was something where she wasn't at fault and couldn't have avoided (directly). Sp. Jounin would outrank Chunin unless otherwise specified? So if Tsunade gave a Chunin the Team Leader role and still assigned a Sp. Jounin, that's how it would roll.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 99</p><p><hr /></p><p>This is a wonderful day. I've never seen this one before ~ Maya Angelou</p><p><hr /></p><p>I stopped in a bathroom and splashed cold water on my face, trying to control my trembling. My face in the mirror looked pale and wan.</p><p>What an emotional wreck of a day.</p><p>'Wrung out' didn't even begin to cover it.</p><p>And yet, of all the ways that that conversation could have gone – all the permutations I'd run through in my head – that had been the best. Better than I'd dared to hope, truthfully. I wasn't in trouble. It was a weight, lifted off my shoulders. Only one of many, granted, but the absence of it made the others seem less daunting.</p><p>I had handed over information that I shouldn't have had and it had been <em> okay.</em></p><p>No, more than that.</p><p>I had handed over information on <em> Akatsuki.</em></p><p>I had done something about Akatsuki. Whether it paid off… Whether it meant anything in the long run… I couldn't tell. But I had done <em> something</em> .</p><p>It was like walking along a very long road, heavy step by heavy step, seemingly endless and impossible, only to look back and find you were halfway up a mountainside. There was still a long way to go. Still the rest of the mountain to climb. But I had managed to come further than I had thought. And there were paths ahead of me now, ways I could keep moving forward, easier and easier.</p><p>If I found more information, I could hand that over too. People could prepare. We could be ready for it, when it came.</p><p>I dried my hands briskly and headed back towards the Sensory Squad.</p><p>Tsume had a whole new pile of paperwork waiting for me, which she cheerfully dropped into my hands. I slid back into my chair.</p><p>"Promotion paperwork?" Kiba asked, reading the header upside down. "What, you didn't do it already? I am disappointed."</p><p>I tapped the second line with my pen, directing his eyes.</p><p>"No," he said. "You didn't."</p><p>There was a brief flurry around the table as we proved just how <em> easily</em> sensory specialist ninja could cheat on paperwork.</p><p>"Uh, surprise?" I said, shrugging awkwardly.</p><p>There was a resounding silence.</p><p>Then Sasuke flat out rolled his eyes at me "No one is actually surprised," he said, tone implying 'you idiot' in the exact same fond intonation he would have used on Naruto.</p><p>"Oh," I said, intelligently, blinking at the faces of my friends who were acting like this was, to some degree, expected.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"I will admit to a small degree of surprise," Shino said. "Why? Because of your specialization. I was not previously aware that your sensory abilities were so advanced. However, today was sufficient evidence that I was merely lacking in information." He adjusted his glasses.</p><p>I blinked at him. "Uhm. Thanks, Shino?" I said, still utterly floored. They hadn't doubted it at all, had they? Somehow, they had looked at me and thought I could do it. Right here, in the absence of reaction, was the support I'd been looking for. They had never even thought to doubt it.</p><p>"Come on, you can't be <em> that</em> surprised," Kiba said. "You were <em> there.</em> That thing where you fought a Jinchuriki? Ring any bells?"</p><p>"Gaara is the Kazekage now," I blurted out, unthinkingly, because Tsunade had just told me and the fact was right at the tip of my tongue.</p><p>It was a mistake.</p><p>Sasuke very calmly put his head down on the table.</p><p>Kiba started laughing so hard he wheezed.</p><p>I waved my hands, flustered. "Stop it!"</p><p>"Oh sure," Kiba said, as he gasped for breath. "I have no idea why you were promoted." His voice went high, like he was mimicking a conversation. "Oh, that's just Shikako Shadow Killer, I can't believe they even gave her a Chunin vest. Standards must be slipping."</p><p>I kicked him underneath the desk. "Okay, you made your point."</p><p>I dove back into my paperwork before things got even further out of hand and ignored them all. They were mostly finished, having completed theirs while I was busy with other things.</p><p>"Alright, brats," Tsume said, when the table started to get too rowdy. "Hand it in and get out of here. Be here tomorrow morning and we'll get you set up with training plans and all that."</p><p>I scrawled the last signature on the page and dropped my pen. Not the most informative of instructions, but it would have to do. And I'd have to drop by the Intel Division after to get <em> that</em> sorted out.</p><p>I went home.</p><p>"Tadaima!" I called, shucking my shoes and hanging my vest on the coat rack. Everyone was sitting down for dinner, and I gladly made myself a plate in the kitchen and joined them.</p><p>"Busy day?" Dad asked mildly.</p><p>"I got promoted to Special Jounin," I said, equally mildly. Huh. He was the only one in the room that outranked me, now, come to think of it. That was <em> weird.</em> It had been weird enough being the same rank as Mum, let alone higher.</p><p>Gratifyingly, even Dad looked surprised by that one.</p><p>"But, what?" Shikamaru asked. As far as first words said to each other after a fight went, they weren't bad.</p><p>"In the Sensory Squad," I elaborated, smiling, just a little. "Oh, and I signed up for a three month rotation in the Intel Division." I nodded to myself, in satisfaction.</p><p>They probably wouldn't even find that too strange. Konoha had a policy for Chunin or higher ranks (though it was obviously flexible, especially for people in high demand) that they should do three months of in-village work every three years on duty. At the tower, or gate duty and patrolling or teaching or any of the other in-village positions. It could be all one at once in a chunk, or spread out over the years. It helped ensure there were enough shinobi staffing the important positions in the village, and to remind people of what it was they were fighting for. And possibly, though no one said, to give individual shinobi had a period of lower intensity and less dangerous work.</p><p>The fact that Tsunade had specified 'three months' mean that the easiest possible conclusions was that that was what I was doing. And at the same time, the time constraint was reassuring – it wasn't permanent. If I didn't like it, if it wasn't helping, it was only three months and I could go back to doing field work.</p><p>"That's lovely, dear," Mum said, as looks were exchanged around the table. "What are you doing?"</p><p>I shrugged. "I don't know yet," I said. "I have to go in tomorrow and find out."</p><p>"We might be working together then," Shikamaru said.</p><p>"We might," I agreed, even though I didn't think it was very likely.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning I woke up early.</p><p>"Morning," I said to Mum as she started cooking breakfast. Sometimes I wondered if she was actually a morning person, or if she had just decided at some point that someone needed to make sure we all actually got up and no one else was going to do it. It was a labour of love that we never thanked her for. "I'll feed the deer. Let Shika and Dad sleep in, yeah?"</p><p>I slipped out the back door and into the forest towards the deer pens. They were mostly empty, the majority of the deer wandering in the larger, fenced off areas of the clan grounds, but there were feeding troughs and water that needed to be refilled and checked.</p><p>I was mostly done when dad wandered out, casual and vestless and leant against the fencepost.</p><p>I called a greeting, but finished up before I went over, hauling myself up to sit on the fence. The empty feed bucket drummed against my legs, so I balanced it on my toes, just to see if I could. It was barely difficult.</p><p>"You're up early," Dad said, rolling his shoulders to ease them.</p><p>"I woke up early," I said, which was really all it was. Okay, there had been the requisite 'I'm awake but do I really want to be <em> up</em> ' debate involved, but all said I was still up under my own power.</p><p>"Excited for work?" He asked, almost teasing. "Nervous?"</p><p>I shrugged. "Not really. Maybe a bit? I don't really know what it'll be like." Which might have worried me more, if that hadn't been what receiving missions was like. Any day could bring anything. I'd cope.</p><p>"I didn't think you were interested in the Intelligence Division," he said, thoughtfully.</p><p>I hummed and swung my feet. The bucket wobbled but stayed. "Tsunade-sama suggested it," I said, because I doubted he'd remain in the dark about it. "It's only three months, anyway."</p><p>"I see," he said, and I wondered if he saw more than I did. Probably. "It's not a bad plan. You'll have time to grow into your new rank this way."</p><p>I made a non-committal sound. There were probably more factors in play, especially given the Grass situation. I hoped I wouldn't end up with anything like Sasuke's village grounding – that would just be a pain.</p><p>The conversation faded out.</p><p>I could have left it there. He wasn't asking anything else. He was just waiting.</p><p>There was movement at the far end of the pens, by the gate towards the field. The doe hovered near the trees, watching us, but didn't come closer. I looked away.</p><p>Deer were shy creatures. They weren't like cows or horses that would tolerate or even enjoy human company. Even the domesticated ones were wild at heart. They didn't really do well with human intervention; You could kill them with kindness.</p><p>I leant back, lightly kicked the bucket up into my hands and inspected it. "You'll look after Shika, right?" I asked.</p><p>The words hung quietly in the air, nearly mumbled. I hadn't said them loud. I hoped he'd heard, because I wasn't sure I could repeat them.</p><p>"Of course," Dad said, steady and calm. Serious. Factual. He would. I hardly needed to ask. He already had, hadn't he? I even heard them talking.</p><p>"I couldn't," I said, haltingly. "I couldn't fix him."</p><p>There was an empty, inviting silence. The words spilled out of me to fill it. "He was hurting," I said. "And I couldn't…I mean, I saw it. I knew. But I didn't…"</p><p>Of course I'd seen it. I wasn't blind. And even if I hadn't it wasn't like Shikamaru had let me forget that he'd seen me die and it had hurt him. I'd just. I'd just been trying to help him the way I wished he would help me – I'd been ignoring it and pretending everything was fine.</p><p>But Shikamaru wasn't me. He wasn't exactly an emotional person – but he'd never held back when he was. If he felt like crying he would cry and damn anyone who said anything about it.</p><p>So maybe he had needed someone to let him cry, to acknowledge that pain.</p><p>Only…</p><p>"I couldn't fix him," I repeated, voice small. "Because I was trying to look after <em> me</em> . "</p><p>And if I'd been able to find my footing, to get back into the swing of dealing with life and missions and everything, then I could have sat down next to him and let him cry. And it wouldn't have only made me worse.</p><p>But it hadn't happened like that.</p><p>"It's not," Dad said, "your job to fix your brother, Shikako. It's not your job to fix anyone but yourself." He took the bucket out of my hands, set it down on the ground and took my hands in his own. My fingers were dwarfed by his, tiny and pale and I had a moment of disconnect. Those were a child's hands. Not mine. But I twitched them and they moved and the feeling passed like a wave retreating from the sand.</p><p>"I'm trying," I said, voice small. "I am, okay?"</p><p>"I know," Dad said, so gentle, like I would spook and run. Maybe he was right. "And if you need us - any of us - to help with that, then we're here."</p><p>My mouth twisted in a grimace even as I tried to keep it flat. They all wanted me to talk about it. To drag everything up and lay it out in daylight to look at. Like things that were painful got better when you poked at them. Maybe some of it, if I was careful, I could share. But even then, what could they do?</p><p>"Thanks," I said, instead. I squeezed his hands and jumped down from the fence. "Breakfast must be ready now. I'm hungry."</p><p>After breakfast, I slipped out of the house. Mom and Dad were standing in the kitchen, arms around each other, talking in quiet murmurs. I didn't want to interrupt, so I waved goodbye silently and left, swinging by the Yamanaka flower shop to find Ino.</p><p>"Morning," I drawled, hands in my pockets. "Ready for training?"</p><p>She smiled, the expression taking over her whole face. "Sure am," she said brightly. "You look cheerful this morning."</p><p>"So do you," I said back, slightly bemused. It wasn't exactly like I was singing and dancing over here.</p><p>If possible, she beamed even harder. Ino snagged a cut flower from a vase and tucked it behind her ear, then grabbed a second one and did the same for me. "There," she said in satisfaction. "Now you're just as pretty as me."</p><p>I laughed. "That'll take more than a flower, Ino."</p><p>She linked her arm through mine and dragged me out of the shop.</p><p>"Can you help me with something?" I asked, digging my hand in my pocket and pulling out my Chunin earrings. "I want to wear both sets."</p><p>The hoops were for Genin. Studs for Chunin. Beyond that there was no tradition and people wore whatever earrings they liked or nothing at all. But for all that it wasn't a tradition strictly adhered to, I didn't want to give it up just yet.</p><p>"You could put them in yourself," Ino said, even as she took them from me. We paused, finding somewhere to stop that was out of the way.</p><p>"I want them to be even," I said, because yes, stabbing myself with things wasn't difficult. But even with a mirror I probably wouldn't have made them match on both sides. Easier to get someone else to do it.</p><p>She acknowledged the point, flicking them with medical chakra for sterilization and coating them for a sharp point. I held still while she pulled my ear and threaded it through, capping it with the butterfly, and repeated the process on the other side.</p><p>I didn't even feel it.</p><p>She examined me critically, then nodded. "Looks good."</p><p>I smiled at her. "Thanks."</p><p>At the tower, we milled around with the rest of the new Sensory Squad inductees, until Tsume came along with a bunch of scrolls and started herding us around.</p><p>"Tonbo! This one is with you," she called, dropping a scroll into my hand and giving me a push in a specific direction.</p><p>I staggered forward awkwardly until someone else appeared to respond to her directions. Tonbo – apparently – was a semi-familiar Chunin who had been part of the Konoha Chunin Exams proctors. He was fairly distinctive because he wore bandages that covered the entire top of his head, right down over his eyes. Which did indicate a sensor, because any ninja that wasn't using visual cues had to have something else going on.</p><p>"Come on, then," he said cheerfully, and we escaped the chaos of the tower to somewhere quieter outside. "So in case you missed that, I'm Tonbo Tobitake. I mostly work for the Intelligence Division but I'm a specialized chakra sensor. For the next week, we're going to be working on the training plan Tsume-senpai has given you and see how we can level out your abilities. Have you had sensory training before?"</p><p>"Not really," I said, because no one had ever taught me <em> how.</em></p><p>"Huh," he said and shook his head. "Okay, I didn't believe it but fair enough. We'll start from the beginning, then."</p><p>'From the beginning' really did mean 'from the beginning'. And while it was – and I was honest – a little bit patronizing to be told how to do things I'd been able to do since <em> birth</em> … I could see the logic to it. Because sensing like this was kind of like sight. I'd been born knowing how to see. But at the Academy we had done all kinds of visual recognition training to turn that sight into a usable, tactical ability. You could see, but that didn't always mean you knew what you were seeing. Or remembered it. Or knew how to interpret it.</p><p>I hadn't started to get good at sensing – really good – until after graduation when I'd had to <em> use</em> it.</p><p>So yep. 'From the beginning' it was. We blitzed through a lot of the instructions and exercises pretty quickly. Some of them would require repetition and practice to hone, but I didn't foresee that being difficult, either.</p><p>After lunch we went sparring. Or rather, taijutsu-only blind fighting, because practical applications were the only things that mattered, in the end. I <em> had</em> been practicing this, but it was immediately clear that I was miles out matched.</p><p>Still. I could hide my chakra. And that helped, though it didn't actually let me win, or anything like that.</p><p>"Nice try," he said. "But there's a lot for you to work on."</p><p>"Thank you, Tonbo-sensei," I said, gasping for air. It hadn't been the most intense spar I'd ever had, but it hadn't been <em> slow</em> either. Taijutsu was high intensity at the best of times let alone when you were not entirely certain of what you were doing or where your opponent was.</p><p>After he left, I dragged myself back to the tower to find out what I was doing for the Intel Division. The mission desk roster sent me up a couple of floors, where I had to wait for someone to come and get me.</p><p>"Shikako Nara, right?" A Special Jounin with dark sunglasses said, ambling out shortly after I arrived. "Aoba Yamashiro. I'll be completing your induction."</p><p>"Induction?" I asked, as politely as I could. He walked me inside, to an office that had – surprise, surprise – a whole pile of paperwork waiting for us.</p><p>He hummed, moving behind the desk. "There's a lot of paperwork and procedures you need to be filled in on before you can start working on anything. Security clearances, door keys, all that kind of stuff."</p><p>I nodded, sinking into the visitors chair. "Makes sense."</p><p>"Hokage-sama said you were training with the Sensory Squad at the moment," he said briskly. "I'll roster you on for the afternoon shift for the first couple of weeks, then. It's a little quieter, so it's a good place to start."</p><p>Konoha tower was a twenty four hour operation, so the day was broken up into three eight hour shifts. Eight to four, four to midnight, and midnight to eight. Day, afternoon and night.</p><p>"Sounds good," I said. It would mean a long day for me, but that was already going to be happening while I was trying to juggle both roles.</p><p>He scribbled something down. "Okay, the next thing is; You've been assigned to the Cryptology Team."</p><p>I blinked. "The Cryptology Team?" I echoed. That… wasn't what I expected. Tsunade had said 'learn to do it properly' when she'd assigned me here which I hadn't taken to mean <em> codes</em> . And while I was smart, I didn't actually have any particular training in codes or code-breaking.</p><p>"Everyone is in cryptology," Aoba said, "especially when they aren't."</p><p>"Okay," I said slowly. It didn't quite parse, but I got the idea. Layers within layers. <em> Underneath the underneath.</em> Oh, this was going to be real fun, wasn't it?</p><p>I was given keys and access codes, but not one of the spiffy Intel uniforms. They were apparently for permanent staff only and didn't come in size 'tiny'.</p><p>Then we went for a tour of the facilities – which areas I could access, which I couldn't, where the lines of security access were drawn and which ones I had and did not have, who worked in which areas and offices and which faces and names I would need to know… There were a lot of things to learn, and quickly.</p><p>"So this is the Konoha Aviary," Aoba said, after we'd trekked up a long spiral stair case to a circular building built around a tree. "It's a pretty important location. You'll be running messages to and from here a fair bit, I think."</p><p>We ducked in to say hello to the two ninja on duty.</p><p>"You might be posted here for a few weeks to learn how to handle the birds," Aoba said. "Er, you know, just in case."</p><p>Just in case I needed to send messages without having to go through official channels? Just in case I <em> received</em> messages not through official channels? Just in case I was in the field when one found me? Just in case they didn't have enough people?</p><p>There were a lot of potential 'just in case's.</p><p>"And our last stop," he said. "The Konoha Cryptanalysis Team." The office building he led me into was almost like a library. The walls were lined with shelves and books.</p><p>He introduced me to the head of Cryptology, Mitoku, who was a friendly middle aged man who didn't seem too perturbed at having random ninja shoved into his division. "Shiho can get you started," he told me. "There'll be a free desk around somewhere. Maybe down the back?"</p><p>Shiho turned out to be a pale blonde teen wearing a pair of crazy spiral glasses. She seemed <em> just</em> on the edge of frazzled and overworked, which was a feeling I could sympathize with.</p><p>"Hi, yes," she said, rattling on and winding through the stacks of books to a work area with empty tables. "You should have a desk. This one used to be Amaya's but she left to go and have kids so no one is using it now. Anyway, it's got a lockable drawer which you should put any secure information you're working on into. Also pens. Pens always go missing around here. You should protect them."</p><p>The desk was a basic plywood thing and the drawer didn't look too flash either. It had a simple lockbox key and I was pretty sure it wouldn't have even taken me a second to pick. But there was a strip of seals stuck to the inside lip of the drawer that was <em> much</em> more interesting. I recognized a few at first glance and could tell that that initial 'easy to pick' assumption would probably only result in tears and pain.</p><p>She pulled me along. "So this shelf is our CIRS paperwork-"</p><p>"Cirs?" I asked, recognizing that it was a descriptor but having no idea what it actually meant.</p><p>She looked distressed, shifting her glasses. "Classified Information Reporting System," she rattled off. "There are processes that we have to follow when we're retrieving information, depending on what security clearance it is and who coded it and who it's for..."</p><p>"Don't worry," Aoba cut in. "I'll cover all of that. You just go on with the tour."</p><p>Ah, paperwork systems. That, I could handle. I'd worked with nightmare systems before in science laboratories. Somehow that experience had not been so relevant to my ninja career before.</p><p>"Well," she said, taking down one of the folders and dropping it in my arms. "You'll need to read the overview. And maybe the one for the IICBRS?" She dropped another folder on top of the first. "Anyway, so over here is the codebook archive. These are only the low clearance ones, so mostly they're inactive. But you should probably read this, because it covers Konoha's most commonly used ones." She plucked a book off the shelves, which was intimidatingly large. "Sometimes we get to decode historical messages, which is always quite fun! Or people use them in a hurry when they can't remember anything else."</p><p>She dragged me along the shelves. They all looked the same to me, at this point.</p><p>"And over here is the ciphers! Substitutions over here, transpositions over there." She shifted her glasses again. "Of course, all these have been decrypted, so if we see them in a message we can break it almost instantly!"</p><p>I looked at the shelves. They towered. "Right," I said, almost overwhelmed.</p><p>Shiho piled a few more books into my arms. "These are just basic introductions," she said, blithely. "They'll help you get started!"</p><p>I put the pile of books back on my desk. Aoba looked amused.</p><p>"Okay," I said. "Where do we start? CIRS?"</p><p>"A few steps further back," he said. "Welcome to the exciting world of tower paperwork. If you thought mission reports were bad, you're in for a nasty surprise."</p><p>Several hours later, I was about seventy percent certain that Aoba was taking joy in introducing the system in the most confusing ways possible.</p><p>I was not going to let him win.</p><p><em> You cannot be this complicated and still work</em> , I thought at it. <em> No one would ever be able to track anything.</em> Though maybe that was the point. Maybe the labyrinth twists of paperwork were only there to distract those unfamiliar with them – a line of defence to keep secret information secret.</p><p>Or maybe I had just been reading the same sentence over and over again too many times.</p><p>Shiho knocked politely on my desk, clearly in lieu of having a door to introduce herself on. "We're all going to dinner now," she said. "There's a little kitchen next door where we all eat."</p><p>My eyes were drawn to the clock. Eight pm. It felt like it, and it didn't, at the same time.</p><p>Aoba stretched. "I'm going to go pick something up," he said. "Be back here in half an hour."</p><p>I stood, then realized I hadn't come prepared. "Ah, I didn't bring anything with me," I said, chagrined. I hadn't expected to spend a shift here immediately.</p><p>Shiho touched my shoulder. "It's okay!" she said. "I keep extra stuff here, just in case it gets too busy. You can have some."</p><p>"Thank you," I said, genuinely touched. "That's very kind."</p><p>She showed me where the small kitchen was, which was homey and nicely appointed. It had a fridge, microwave and toaster, hot water zip and <em> two</em> coffee makers. There was a table crammed in, with an excess of chairs scattered around it. There were already a couple of people sitting down eating, one flicking through a book one handed.</p><p>I felt awkward and out of place, but Shiho chattered on. I tried gamely to keep up once she started actually talking about her work, but it flew over my head and the most I could do was keep prompting with questions.</p><p>"Have you done your O-R hours this week Shiho?" One of the other ninja at the kitchen table asked. It had the tone of both a frequently asked question, and a reprimand.</p><p>Shiho wilted, a little. "But I've been so busy," she said, and it was nearly a whine.</p><p>"O-R?" I asked, again missing the meaning behind the acronym. I foresaw this happening a lot in the next few weeks.</p><p>"Operational Readiness," Shiho translated gloomily. "We have to do four hours of physical training a week. But it's not like I'm <em> ever</em> going to go on missions, so I don't see why I have to do it. Do you know how much I can get done in four hours?"</p><p>"You still have to do it," her colleague replied. "Besides, it means you get paid for leaving the office. Can't beat that, right?"</p><p>"I could help?" I offered, hesitantly. "If you wanted?" She was helping me adjust to this place, after all, it was only fair to offer the same in return. And anyway, I was a field ninja. Physical training I could do.</p><p>"It would be nice to train with someone again," she said, a little wistfully. It wasn't agreement, but it was close.</p><p>The second half of my shift was much quieter. Apparently, a fair portion of the people who had been here hadn't been on afternoon shift – they'd been dayshift people doing overtime. And that… that said more to me about how busy Konoha was than any number of field missions had.</p><p>Maybe more experienced ninja could have said, from the number of missions we were doing, that Konoha was short-staffed and overworked. But it was the only way I'd known missions to be. But the implications with shifts was that you did your time and that was it – not that you did your time and then four hours of overtime just to keep things ticking along.</p><p>It was easy to forget that Konoha was in the process of recovering. That there was a looming threat of war on the border and that tied up resources, too.</p><p>"Alright," Aoba yawned when the clocked ticked over to midnight. "That'll do for now. We'll get into the rest of it tomorrow."</p><p>Rest of it. Well.</p><p>"I look forward to it," I said unenthusiastically.</p><p>He cracked a smile.</p><p><hr /></p><p>That was the pattern my next few days fell into; training with Tonbo-sensei during the day, which lasted four or five hours depending on how much time he had, a few hours to myself, then afternoon shift spent following Aoba-senpai around while he explained the process and systems and paperwork. There was a lot of paperwork.</p><p>I did a lot of fetching of coffee, so at least I was being useful.</p><p>I left the tower at midnight, with the lucky few that weren't pulling overtime, and was surprised to find Kakashi-sensei lounging casually against a lamppost reading his Icha Icha.</p><p>"Oh, Shikako," he said with exaggerated surprise. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Like he <em> just happened</em> to be here as I was leaving. I strolled forward and tucked myself under his arm. I hadn't seen him since the disaster of a dinner party, and though part of that was because I was busy, I half suspected there were more elements to it than that.</p><p>But it was also midnight and I wanted to go home. I tugged him forward, so he was walking with me. He came, obligingly.</p><p>"Hi, sensei," I said, because it had been a long day and I wasn't really prepared to play games. "What's up?"</p><p>He hummed and made non-committal noises for a bit, then said, "team training."</p><p>I leant into him. "I'm training with the Sensory Squad," I said, because he obviously knew I was working at the tower. "Eight am onwards. I don't have <em> time.</em> "</p><p>He was silent. "I can't believe I'm saying this," he muttered to himself. Then, louder, "tomorrow. Training fields. Five am."</p><p>My feet stalled. "Five am?"</p><p>He drew away and gave me an eye smile. "Don't be late," he admonished, and vanished.</p><p>I was left standing in the middle of the street with a perplexed expression.</p><p>But five am the next morning saw me out at our training fields, cradling a thermos of coffee, and thinking dire threats to sensei if he was pulling something funny. But Sasuke was there, looking just as annoyed, so Kakashi-sensei had obviously got to him too.</p><p>Mutely, I offered him my coffee.</p><p>He took it. "You have no idea either, do you?"</p><p>I shrugged. <em> Not a clue.</em></p><p>Awkwardly, he pulled a small box out of his pockets and threw it at me. "Here," he said, looking away. "He said it was tradition."</p><p>I caught it, confused. "What's tradition?"</p><p>"Presents," Sasuke clarified. "For promotions." He took a drink of my coffee, not wanting to say anything else.</p><p>I blinked, slowly. "Oh," I said. "I didn't get you anything." I should have got Sasuke something, shouldn't I? That sounded like a thing I should have done.</p><p>"We all made Chunin; that doesn't even count," he said. "Your <em> other</em> promotion."</p><p><em> Oh,</em> I thought sheepishly, and opened the box. There was a set of earrings inside, silver hoops with a dangling green stone. They were… nice.</p><p>Sasuke was definitely avoiding looking at me now.</p><p><em> Tradition. </em> I cleared my throat. "Thanks. You know, uh, it's our clan tradition. The earrings, I mean. The first set is handed down from your parents, and the second gets given to you by your sensei. But there's no third set." That came out wrong. It sounded ungrateful. I didn't mean it like that. "I mean, I didn't expect more. It's… it's right. Thank you."</p><p>I fumbled the words and didn't look up to meet his eye. Right. Way to accept a present, Shikako. I slipped them out of the box, unhooking the set of hoops I was wearing and exchanging them.</p><p>I weighed them carefully in my hand, an idea forming. It was a little silly, but… "Uh, these are heirlooms," I said. "Not important ones, or anything; they don't really mean anything. But they belonged to my uncle when he was a Genin. And probably to someone else before that I guess. I'm supposed to pass them on…" I shrugged, awkwardly. It wasn't like I ever planned to have kids. There'd be no one to pass them on to, and team was family, right? "Uh, so really. If you want…"</p><p>I pressed them into his hand.</p><p>"You don't have to wear them or anything," I rushed on, voice getting smaller and smaller.</p><p>There was a moment of dizzying silence.</p><p>Sasuke coughed. "Uh. Right. Thanks?" He regarded the hoops in his hand with bemusement. "How <em> do</em> they go on?"</p><p>I threaded them on, like Ino had done to me only days earlier. He shook his head, clearly testing the weight of them as they moved slightly.</p><p>"Looks good?" I offered, uncertainly. They were mostly hidden by his hair anyway.</p><p>Sasuke took a mouthful of coffee, then offered the thermos back to me. We had nearly finished it by the time sensei showed up, which was barely even late for him.</p><p>"First rule," Kakashi-sensei said, eyelid only half open. "You do not mention this to anyone. <em> Especially</em> not Gai."</p><p>We blinked at him. "Sensei?"</p><p>"Trust me," he said, blinking slowly. "This hurts me just as much as it hurts you. But we don't have much time and you need to start learning this."</p><p>He threw me a Konoha style tanto – a short sword – which was a fairly common piece of equipment. Well, I had been meaning to learn some kenjutsu, hadn't I?</p><p>A second one went to Sasuke, though it was older and more worn. Even at first glance the hilt and handguard were different in style. Sasuke thumbed the sheath down, and the blade was sharp and bright.</p><p>"Chakra sabre," Kakashi-sensei muttered, quietly and quickly, like if he said it fast it wouldn't have any meaning. "No point only having one legendary blade on the team. Anyway, you'll pick this up fast enough that it'll be useful. Just be careful; it's fragile."</p><p>I struggled not to raise my eyebrows at him. Sasuke didn't appear to recognize the significance of it, which was probably what sensei wanted.</p><p>"So," Kakashi-sensei went on, drawing another standard tanto that had been strapped to his lower back. "Time to learn, my cute Genin."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I feel like I should have planned ahead so that chapter 100 landed on something important. Alas, it is not to be. Have some gratuitous Sasuke-In-Earrings, for Juno-nine who has suffered for the cause.</p><p>Thanks to everyone who is still here after so long! 100 chapters, 4 years and OVER NINE THOUSAND (reviews).

			<h2>Sensory Squad Arc: Chapter 100</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 100</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper. ~ Bertrand Russell</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>They said time flew when you were having fun. I wasn't exactly sure this counted as 'fun' but I <em> was</em> busy and that was almost the same. I wasn't the only one – Ino had taken a role in the Intelligence Division as well, and I knew that Team Kurenai and Team Gai had both been in and out of the village on missions.</p><p>"Where's Sasuke?" I yawned at sensei, bemused by the idea that he was here before my teammate. It was just <em> wrong.</em></p><p>Kakashi-sensei shifted minutely. "He's doing some other training for a few weeks," he said. "He picked this up faster than you did."</p><p>"Of course he did," I said. I thought I was doing <em> okay</em> for not having a Sharingan and for having two hours every morning to train with. Sasuke spent every minute he wasn't on duty training. And that was no insignificant amount of time.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei crinkled his eye at me. Patronizingly. "A good blade makes up for a lot of deficits," he said sagely. "You'll manage."</p><p><em> Rude.</em> Not untrue, probably, but rude. "You don't need to wake me up at five just to insult me," I grumped.</p><p>"Training, then," Sensei said, making a 'come on' gesture with his hand. "Use it this time."</p><p>I put back the plain sword he'd given me and took out the lightsaber instead. Up until now, I hadn't been training with it –starting at the basics and all that. Better to not build bad habits. Also, it was probably more dangerous if things went wrong.</p><p>But I couldn't stop the way the corner of my mouth kicked up when I ignited it. Kakashi-sensei drew his sword.</p><p>Two hours later, I hauled myself off the ground. Barely. "I regret everything," I said. "Why isn't Sasuke here to distract you? It's his duty."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei snorted softly. "Tough," he said. "You have a lot to learn and I'm not going to have a lot of time to teach you."</p><p>"You have a mission soon?" I asked, because he had been here every morning for a couple of weeks straight. Unless he was completing them <em> really quickly</em> he hadn't been out.</p><p>He hesitated, just a fraction. "Probably soon." He reached out, awkwardly, and patted my shoulder. "Later."</p><p>I blinked at the spot where he'd been, then decided it was just sensei being sensei, and trudged home. After breakfast there was sensory training which was – sometimes – less physically exerting but just as tiring in new and interesting ways. We'd upgraded from route exercises to practical applications which involved a lot of testing of ranges and sensitivities and trying to determine what jutsu had been used recently.</p><p>It took a lot of concentration. In a way, the chakra in the air that I'd been able to sense since birth was like a lot of white noise. There, in the background, but nothing I paid attention to on a regular basis. It was the large spikes of people's chakra signatures that I'd mostly focused on. And now I was trying to pick apart that white noise, to make it resolve into a picture of who and what and when.</p><p>In the Intel Division, I'd been upgraded from running coffees to helping field the influx of low priority, low classification reports – from people like Ami, mostly – that flooded in almost constantly. They were encoded – or encrypted, and yes, the two things were different – so they needed decoding. But we were also the first stop information handlers for them, responsible for making sure that the information was tagged relevantly for later searches, that it was passed along to the appropriate people and that personnel files were updated for reports received and that any skipped reports were noticed and investigated.</p><p>It didn't seem to fall under the context of the 'Cryptanalysis Team' but I was coming to find that job descriptions in Intel were either really freaking vague or deliberately wrong. There was a whole lot of unspoken 'you should just <em> know'</em> involved when trying to work out who should be signing what.</p><p>I had forgotten how much I hated petty office politics.</p><p>"Here," Aoba said, dropping a book down on the table in front of me. "The Bingo Books have finally been printed. This one is for you."</p><p>"Thank you," I said, picking it up to flick through. The Bingo Books went through print runs about once a year – and it was probably no surprise that those coincided with the Chunin Exams. While they had started off as a means for tracking missing ninja – and still mostly did – they had since expanded to a way of spreading information regarding skilled and dangerous ninja from other villages, and as <em> promotional</em> material for our own ninja.</p><p>Which was a bit of a double edged sword, because you could make anyone sound as amazing as you liked, but you were still putting out information on them.</p><p>"We'll probably get copies from the other villages soon," he continued, off hand. "The Special Jounin usually get together to go over them, if you wanted to join in."</p><p>I blinked, a little surprised at the offer. On one hand, I did not have the time. Like, at all. On the other, I also hadn't socialized with anyone of my new rank since being promoted and I really felt like I should. I'd been reminded that office politics were a thing and I should really be building good working relationships and all that. And a more work related topic was a better alternative than 'Friday night drinks' or whatever.</p><p>"Uhm, sure? Let me know when and I'll try and make it?" Which was really about the best that I could promise.</p><p>"Cool. Okay, so next week you'll probably be working with the Aviary, then after that I'll see if I can swing us some actual field work. Probably nothing hugely exciting but-"</p><p>The entire room suddenly went silent. The kind of silent where dozens of people cut themselves off in midword.</p><p>I'd sensed people arriving but people were always coming and going from the offices. We were working; it was busy. I didn't crane my head to look at the door, but only because whoever it was was coming this way.</p><p>"Aoba," Ibiki said, and no wonder everyone had gone completely silent. He cut an intimidating figure in his greys and black trench coat. "Shikako. Mind if I borrow her for a bit?" He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Aoba opened his mouth. Closed it. Seemed to struggle for words for a second. "Sure. Go ahead. I will just … finish all this."</p><p>I slid out of my chair, puzzled. "Ibiki-taicho? Can I help you?"</p><p>He nodded. "Come with me," he said, and walked away, secure in the knowledge that I would follow.</p><p>I did. Was there a mission?</p><p>But we didn't go to the Hokage's office. Or to the briefing rooms. We went down. Down and down. And the further we went into unfamiliar territory, the more and more nervous I got. I really, really tried not to show it, or to think it, but there were so many ways this could go really wrong.</p><p>By the time I was sitting opposite him at a table in a blank, windowed room… sure 'nervous' didn't quite cover it. I was almost sick with it, stomach twisting like I'd been drinking battery acid.</p><p><em> What do they know, what do they know, whatdotheyknow…</em></p><p>It was folded up, hidden behind a wall of shadow, so I could maintain composure. I needed it. Desperately needed it right now. Whatever this was, it was walking a knife edge of danger.</p><p><em> Where did I slip up? What happened? Whatdotheyknow? </em></p><p>"Do you know why you're here?" Ibiki asked, calmly, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>I folded my hands on the table, clearly, visibly. "I'm afraid not, Ibiki-taicho," I said, letting my voice have a small amount of puzzlement but being otherwise calm. "Is there a mission?"</p><p>He waited.</p><p>I waited. I needed to wait. <em> Just wait it out. Just wait it out. Don't say anything.</em></p><p>My mouth was dry but I couldn't swallow. That would look like a sign of nervousness. I couldn't, couldn't, look like I had anything to hide.</p><p>He set a Bingo Book down on the table. It wasn't the one Aoba had given me just earlier – there was a Rock symbol on the front cover. Clearly the other village books he'd been talking about.</p><p>But.</p><p>Of all the things I'd worried Ibiki would try and ask me about…</p><p>"A Rock Bingo Book?" I said, utterly uncertain. I glanced up at him. His face was impassive and gave nothing away.</p><p>I didn't have the script for this. I didn't know what was going on. At all.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Ibiki-taicho. I have no idea?"</p><p>He flipped it open. A picture of my own face stared back up at me. My name, next to it.</p><p>I looked up at him again. Still, impassive. Still, nothing.</p><p>"What's this?" he asked, finally breaking his silence, tapping at something halfway down the page.</p><p>I actually read it this time. My name. Epitaphs. (Dammit, Ino, I knew it would stick.) Rank. (And they would be annoyed to find that their information was out of date so fast, surely.) Team. Skills.</p><p>I paused, next to Ibiki's finger. "<em> Interrogation?</em> "</p><p>I looked at him, baffled. Like, his interest made slightly more sense right now, but also less sense because <em> what.</em></p><p>"I'm very interested in any one who gets this designation in their Bingo Books," Ibiki said. "Especially when I haven't already heard about it."</p><p>Rock. Interrogation. I <em> had</em> thought the police chief was a Rock informant, hadn't I? "Land of Stone," I said. "It must have been. It would have been in my report, then?"</p><p>Ibiki leant back. He hadn't exactly been looming, but I felt the extra space acutely. Like an easing of pressure. "Oh? I'll make a note of it," he said. "Tell me what happened."</p><p>"It was hardly an interrogation," I said awkwardly. "We just needed a criminal to confess to a crime that he'd framed someone else for. I only scared him until he did."</p><p>"Scared him?" Ibiki repeated, questioningly. "How did you manage that?"</p><p>"Killing Intent," I supplied. "It mixes weird with Shadow Jutsu." I shrugged. Turns out that that hadn't been an unknown fact, it was just one of those quirks of jutsu that no one had really bothered with. The advantages weren't huge.</p><p>Ibiki looked contemplative. "Show me."</p><p>I swallowed. "Um." Killing Intent. On Ibiki? If anyone would get squished in that combination, it was me. Without a doubt.</p><p>But he didn't appear to be joking. So I closed my eyes and tried to recall that feeling, tried to set aside gut churning nervousness and sweaty palms and go back to a place where I had been confident and in control. Gosunkugi had been no threat. He'd been nothing. Contemptible.</p><p>I hadn't needed to kill him. But I could have.</p><p>And that feeling, right there. That detached ruthlessness. That thing that had been in Orochimaru's eyes, in Itachi's, that was what made it terrifying.</p><p>I spread it into my chakra, shivered it out into the air. I lifted my hands off the table, went through the seals of the Shadow Possession jutsu and connected to the person sitting across from me.</p><p>"<strong> Talk</strong> ," I said.</p><p>My voice rang out into silence. I opened my eyes and the image in my head shattered – the belief, the knowledge that I was the most dangerous thing around was proven false. My Killing Intent faded away. I let the Shadow Possession fall.</p><p>I coughed. "Like that. Kinda."</p><p>"Just like that?" Ibiki asked.</p><p>I shifted in my seat, just a little, and tried not to feel really embarrassed. Killing Intent on Ibiki. What was I, an idiot? "Yeah well," I said, slightly too fast. "He wasn't a ninja or anything like that so it didn't take much. And, I mean, I don't know if everything he said was <em> true</em> , but we already had half the story from the guy that he framed, so I could make sure that that much lined up. And the police were going to look into everything else."</p><p>"Impressive," he said, after a long second. "You knew both the questions and the answers before you started. That's less common than you might think. And a bigger advantage, too."</p><p>I accepted that comment with a duck of my head, but didn't say anything.</p><p>"So, the real question," Ibiki went on, like they hadn't been <em> all</em> real questions, "is 'do you want to join the Torture and Interrogation Division?' You seem to have a handle on the Interrogation and we can easily educate you on the Torture." He smirked, darkly.</p><p>"Uhm," my mouth said. "No?"</p><p>I could have handled that better. I could <em> absolutely</em> have handled that better.</p><p>"And why not?" Ibiki asked, with what appeared to be genuine interest.</p><p>"I don't think it works," I said. To the Head of Torture and Interrogation. What was I <em> doing?</em></p><p>My eyes slid off him, onto the back wall of the room.</p><p>"What was that?" Ibiki asked, sharply.</p><p>"I don't think it's a reliable method of gathering accurate intelligence," I said, woodenly. Apparently my survival instinct was on vacation today. Clearly informing the Head of T&amp;I that I thought his entire job was useless was on my To Do List. It seemed I hadn't had my required dose of life threatening danger this week. "A person in pain will say whatever is required to get the pain to stop, whether that's true or false. And if you can't determine the difference then they've won and made you stop, or you have to keep going anyway – in which case they will just tell you more potentially false information."</p><p>My teeth clicked shut. Finally. Far too late. There was a long, resounding silence.</p><p>"Good," Ibiki said.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>He smiled. A real one, this time, not that dark thing I'd seen earlier. It dragged me sharply back to the Chunin Exams and that tenth question. <em> A test?</em></p><p>"Good," he repeated. "Do you know <em> why</em> we're interested in people who are known to perform interrogations in the field?"</p><p>It was a leading question. 'Good' meant the answer was not, as I had assumed - been led to assume - 'to offer them a job'. What was it then? Why the interest? Why was he pleased I had turned it down? Turned it down <em> and</em> said those things about it?</p><p>"To see if 'interrogation' is just a cover for 'torture'?" I guessed.</p><p>"Correct," Ibiki said. "We're well aware that it is an inefficient process – and much more likely to be employed as a means of revenge than an actual attempt at gathering information. And <em> that</em> is not the type of thing that Konoha encourages."</p><p>I nodded. It had been a test. And now it didn't matter if I knew it was a test, because I also knew the truth. <em> They're watching for it. They're watching you</em> . "I see," I said.</p><p>And then, because I couldn't help it, I had to ask questions. "Obviously, the Yamanaka jutsu is ideal for gathering information from uncooperative subjects," I said, clinically, burying as many of my emotions as I could. "But what do you recommend in other circumstances?"</p><p>Ibiki looked at me, assessing. He'd been assessing the whole time, but this felt deeper still. Not just watching, but making a judgement. "Come with me," he said, for the second time.</p><p>We left the room, left the tower and strolled through the streets. I balled my hands up and shoved them in my pockets, because they wanted to shake so badly.</p><p>We weren't in a hurry, but there was still a distinct sense of people getting out of our way. It was a little unnerving and I was very aware of everyone watching us.</p><p>We went well out of the main town and towards the outskirts of the village, to where the prison was. The Konoha Secure Correctional Facility, as it was officially titled. The place that Mizuki had broken out of, months ago.</p><p>Ibiki let us in, locking the gates behind us. There were two Chunin standing guard, but we passed them with little more than a nod, heading towards the main building. There were more guards there, and I was signed in via a visitors logbook and given a lanyard with an identification card.</p><p>"Don't lose it," Ibiki warned. "You won't get out again."</p><p>I nodded, solemnly.</p><p>We didn't go down into the prison proper, into the cells, but to a more 'normal' looking section. The offices and workspaces of the ninja who staffed it, presumably. The room Ibiki took me to was not so different from the one we had come from in the tower, except that this one was on the other side of the one way mirror, allowing us to look into a cozy, casual looking office. There were stuffed couches and bookshelves and a solid, intimidating desk that was completely empty.</p><p>An older lady - maybe sixty, maybe seventy – with white hair in tidy curls sat in an armchair making notes on a clipboard. Her eyes flicked up to the mirror as we entered, but she didn't otherwise react.</p><p>"We're a few minutes early," Ibiki told me, then settled into a chair and prepared to wait. "That's Seki Hijiri. She's been working in this prison for as long as it's existed. She's one of our best interpersonal contact intelligence officers."</p><p>I sat next to him, not quite sure what we were waiting for, but willing to find out.</p><p>The door to the interrogation room – what else could it have been, really, no matter what it looked like – opened and two guards escorted a prisoner in.</p><p>"Hello, Tayuya," Seki said with a warm, grandmotherly smile. She set her clipboard down, the gesture deliberate and noticeable.</p><p>"Fuck you," the red haired girl spat in return. But it was lacking edge, lacking force, almost a route response.</p><p>I eyed her critically. I hadn't expected to see her again. We'd fought her and captured her and nearly killed her and that had been that. I'd known she had been taken to T&amp;I – had escaped it when Mizuki had broken out and been dragged back by Jiraiya – but I had barely spared her another thought after that.</p><p>She looked… well. Unharmed. Not starving. Not sick. Not happy, clearly, but though she wrenched her wrists out of the guards grip and threw herself down a chair, she didn't attack. There were seals creeping across her skin that said it probably wouldn't work, if she did try.</p><p>All in all, if I had ever anticipated how I expected to see Tayuya again, this was probably a hundred times better.</p><p>"How are you today?" Seki asked.</p><p>"Rapport building," Ibiki explained to me. "It took some time to find an interrogator that she responded. Our initial attempts with masculine authority figures went very badly, including my own."</p><p>He didn't appear perturbed or dismayed by it, like it was simply a statement of fact. Something that sometimes happened, for whatever reason.</p><p>Tayuya glowered and sank lower in her chair. "You know how I am. Get on with it. Ask me about Orochimaru so I can tell you to fuck off and get back to digging fucking holes and trying to have a fucking shower while forty <em> fucking</em> pricks watch my every move."</p><p>Seki didn't appear at all daunted by the language or tirade. "What <em> do</em> you hope to accomplish by being uncooperative, Tayuya? Where do you see your future going from here?"</p><p>"Orochimaru-sama will take us back," Tayuya said. "He'll free us." She said it stubbornly, but I wasn't sure who she was trying to convince – Seki or herself.</p><p>Ibiki made a considering noise. "She's backsliding. It's not unexpected," he said. "All three of the team have been… willing to share information in exchange for being able to see each other – heavily monitored, of course. But it seems to have undone some progress."</p><p>The interview in the room below us went on. It was actually fascinating to watch, if … creepy. Seki was calm and warm and completely in control of the situation. She talked Tayuya round in circles, taking her from an angry and hostile enemy to a young girl who wanted to impress the person in front of her.</p><p>"She's still holding back quite a bit," Ibiki said, studying her. "I suspect it's simply to prolong the interest we have in her. None of them are quite sure of what we'll do once we have all the information they possess, but I don't imagine they're entertaining pleasant notions."</p><p>Well, <em> I</em> didn't really know what they would do with them, either, and I had a bit more trust in Konoha so yeah, I could guess why Tayuya worried about it. We wouldn't send them back to Orochimaru – and I suspected that even if we had that wouldn't have ended pleasantly for her – but in some ways they still made decent bargaining chips.</p><p>The interview finished. Tayuya was escorted out of the room by the guards, and Seki picked up her clipboard and left. Seconds later, the door to our room opened up and she entered.</p><p>"Ibiki," she said, flicking a curious look at me but didn't ask. "Something interest you?"</p><p>He shook his head. "I wasn't checking up on anything in particular. But what are your thoughts on the prisoner?"</p><p>"She's desperate to remain useful," she said, flicking through a few pages of notes. "Some of the information she's providing is not deliberately false, but almost certainly things she wasn't certain of herself – rumors and such like heard while she was there. I think we're still missing a few big pieces of critical information which are being deliberately excluded – the locations of the main bases, certainly – but between the three sources we have gathered a fairly detailed picture."</p><p>The locations of the bases Tayuya knew about might, or might not, have been critical information. If Orochimaru was smart, which he was, he would have abandoned them when his shinobi were captured. On the other hand, if he was arrogant, he might not, and the fact that <em> Orochimaru </em> was almost certainly at one of them would make us hesitate to attack anyway.</p><p>"I think we need to give some positive reinforcement," Seki went on. "I'm a little leery of giving her free-time, I think that would just result in a spiral of negative thinking. I'm officially suggesting a shift to private bathing facilities. Or private apart from guards," she amended, a little wryly.</p><p>Ibiki tapped his fingers on the table. "Do we have female guards stationed on her?"</p><p>"As many of them as we have," Seki said a little tartly, giving him a long suffering look. "But most of us are aged out of the condition needed to wrestle naked prisoners under control."</p><p>He acknowledged that almost wryly. "Make your recommendation. I'll sign off on it."</p><p>He bade her goodbye and rose out of the chair. I followed, tagging along as we went back to the entrance, signed out, and left the complex.</p><p>"Did that answer your question?" Ibiki asked me.</p><p>I considered it. <em> How do you go about gathering information from people who don't want to give it?</em> In nearly the same ways you went about gathering it from people who did, apparently. You talked to them, convinced them, gave them reasons to tell you or want to tell you.</p><p>And maybe sometimes it worked and maybe sometimes it didn't quite work but you had to make do with what you got. And then you cross referenced it against other things, just to make sure.</p><p>"Yes," I said. "Thank you, Ibiki-taicho."</p><p>He gave me an amused look. "Come back in a few years, and I might offer you a job again," he said. "Most of our interrogators are senior ninja or those retired from service. There's a certain value to age as an indicator of authority in these situations."</p><p>I paused. "Thank you," I said, rather than immediately going 'no' like I had earlier. It wasn't really a job I wanted, exactly, but no longer was it something that I was so fundamentally opposed to, either.</p><p>Unfortunately, I had to go back to work because my shift had only just barely begun. The way the room hushed when I stepped inside was eerily reminiscent of how it had been when I'd left. I ignored it, nodded to the people I passed and slid into my desk.</p><p>"What did I miss?" I asked Aoba quietly.</p><p>"You <em> have</em> to tell me what happened," he said, giving me a pleading look. "What did Ibiki want?"</p><p>I paused. "Just… to talk. He gave me a tour?" I added, because we'd been gone for a while and people absolutely had to have seen us leave. Ibiki hadn't said 'don't talk about it' but it was also clearly stuff that wasn't common knowledge. And it was a bit embarrassing on my part to bring up the bingo book entry.</p><p>He groaned. "Don't be like that. You're killing me."</p><p>I shrugged. "Sorry? It wasn't really a big deal."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sensory Squad Arc: Chapter 101</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 101</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. ~ Helen Keller</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The next day, the Bingo Books had finished their formal assessment and been released, so after our shift finished – and it actually finished on time, for once – Aoba dragged me out of the tower to a reasonably close by shinobi bar. It was the kind that was like an office bar, but for ninja who worked at the tower, as opposed to one of the shinobi bars that had perpetually broken tables and kunai stuck in the walls.</p><p>There was a door guard who didn't check ID but who appeared to let us in based on the fact that he recognized Aoba.</p><p>"We hired the place out for the night," he explained to me cheerfully. "Makes it easier."</p><p>The place wasn't <em> packed</em> but it was still relatively busy. There were a few people I recognized, but so many more I didn't.</p><p>We wound our way towards the bar. "Coffee?" I asked hopefully, because it was late and I was tired and I was adamantly not drinking anything alcoholic. I'd never been a chatty drunk, but it was 100% not a risk I was willing to take.</p><p>Aoba got his drink and then was drawn into a conversation with someone at the bar that I didn't know. I stood awkwardly beside him for a second, scanning the place for people I did recognize. There was Anko, but she was in the middle of a group of people and I hardly wanted to interrupt. There were the other proctors from the exam, and the more familiar faces, but none of them I knew so well as to approach.</p><p>But tucked away in the corner there was an empty table with someone I did recognize. It seemed a better option than standing by myself.</p><p>"Ibiki-taicho," I greeted, having edged my way around the room. "This seat free?"</p><p>He gave me an amused smile. "Help yourself."</p><p>I slid into the bench. "I don't know many people here," I said, a tad apologetically. "I thought you would have already gone over the Bingo Books?"</p><p>I <em> knew</em> he had, as a matter of fact.</p><p>"I don't know if you've noticed," he said dryly, "but these occasions are mostly just an excuse for a party."</p><p>I nodded. Holding it at a pub seemed to be a bit of a giveaway. It was much less the 'work gathering' that I thought I'd been agreeing to.</p><p>"Still," he went on, "it is interesting to see how they react to it."</p><p>The books were already out and circulating. I watched as one group turned a page and there was a sudden, raucous, burst of laughter. Clearly at someone's expense, because there was a large amount of arm waving going on in protest.</p><p>"Ibiki! You have to see this!" Anko called, bursting into the booth and knocking over his drink. She paid it no attention, draping an arm over his shoulder and mashing a book in his face, far too close to read.</p><p>He pushed it to a more reasonable distance. "Fascinating."</p><p>I barricaded the spilled drink with napkins and tried to mop it up before it ran over the edge of the table and dripped all over me.</p><p>When I looked back up she was grinning wildly. "You're making friends, Ibiki. I never thought I'd see the day."</p><p>"Anko-senpai," I said, giving her an awkward wave. "Hi." I grasped around for some kind of conversation opening. "How's your team?"</p><p>"Really good," she said, looking genuinely pleased. "Yakumo has been asking the rest of the girls all about the exams – I think she's looking forward to taking part in one. You should stop by, sometime, and give her your version."</p><p>I nodded. "I haven't had much free time lately," I said. "But I absolutely will."</p><p>A gaggle of Special Jounin followed her over, probably because she'd taken the book with her. There were a few familiar faces amongst them – Genma with his senbon and Hayate from the Exams. Aoba popped up only seconds later, apparently looking for me.</p><p>"Of <em> course</em> you're over here," he grumbled. Whatever that meant.</p><p>I squeezed along the bench so that people could pile in. It was a little crowded, but Anko put the Bingo Book down on the table. It was apparently the Hidden Cloud one.</p><p>"Look, Hayate," Anko said. "They've raised your status to 'kill on sight'. Guess trashing whasshisname must have really pissed them off, eh?"</p><p>Hayate coughed. "They're just jealous Konoha has better swordsmen," he said. "It's not even our specialty and we kick their ass at it."</p><p>At least half the table jeered.</p><p>I smiled politely and awkwardly and drank my coffee. They teased each other about new rankings and status's – and whether they were true or exaggerated – and compared the profiles of people they had fought in the past.</p><p>Which was nothing I could join in or add to. I was thinking about making a quiet escape – surely this was long enough for a polite showing of face – when I was forcefully dragged back into the conversation.</p><p>"No, really," Genma said. "What did you kids <em> do</em> at the exams? All of you are in the book. And I'm pretty sure I saw some of you in Rock's as well."</p><p>I flicked through the pages. He was correct. It was … a little unnerving. Not just that we were there, but that they seemed structured in a way to make us <em> targets</em> rather than as warnings. "Kicked Cloud's ass?" I said. "I mean, apparently the Raikage thought we were plants or something."</p><p>Anko laughed, like that was the best joke she'd heard. Or maybe she just liked the idea of pulling one over the Raikage.</p><p>"And you've got the Sword of the Thunder God?" Hayate asked. "I thought that got stolen years ago."</p><p>I made an affirmative sound, casting an uncertain look at Ibiki. That whole mess... probably best not to get into too many details. "We ran into that guy on a mission. And then Tsunade-sama said I could keep it." I shrugged. "It's useful."</p><p>"Useful, she says," he repeated, drooping. "Legendary sword is useful."</p><p>Genma patted him on the back. "I'm sure it is," he said. "Very useful. Legendarily useful, even."</p><p>Thankfully the topic of conversation shifted away from me and I was relieved enough to stay a little longer and tentatively offer some comments on the other new inductees. Maybe 'Haku is very kind' wasn't quite what they wanted to hear but at least the 'Naruto thought he was a girl' story still got laughs.</p><p>We traded books with another group and it all started over again. At least Hidden Sand had been kind enough to leave the exam group out of their book, though I did admire the double page spread they'd put together on Gaara as Kazekage. Which mentioned a lot of things in very impressive ways and completely left out the fact that he was thirteen.</p><p>Probably for the best, really.</p><p>But even when the Bingo Books had been investigated and mocked and laughed over, things didn't really wind down. I listened with fascination to weird and wild story after story, to the jokes and references that seemed to be familiar to everyone else.</p><p>And one story demanded proof, so Genma rolled up his sleeve to show the scarring left behind from, apparently, exploding-tree-sap-due-to-lightning-jutsu. Which prompted someone else to show off equally weird but bad scarring.</p><p>"Last year only," Anko chimed in. "Otherwise Ibiki always wins these games."</p><p>Ibiki gave the impression of looming, darkly. "You think I can't win under those terms?" he asked.</p><p>"Go on, then," she challenged, unintimidated.</p><p>He regarded his hands with concentration, then lifted a single finger. "Papercut. Departmental budgeting requests."</p><p>I giggled. It was the only sound in a hushed silence, and I stopped as quickly as I could, hand to my lips.</p><p>Ibiki nodded at me, clearly not upset at the laughter. It <em> had</em> been a joke, then. "Go on."</p><p><em> Me next?</em> I blinked, then rallied. "Okay, uh. Bone spikes," I said and pushed my sleeve up to show the torn skin on my forearm and the spot on my hand where it had gone straight through.</p><p>"Your bone or someone else's?" Anko asked, squinting at it. "You get bonus pain points for your own, creepy points otherwise."</p><p>"Someone else," I clarified.</p><p>"Sick," she said, appreciatively. Genma elbowed her in the side. "Yeah, okay. Acid spray burns," she went on, picking up the game.</p><p>Aoba had apparently been clawed by a hawk, though he refused to confirm if it was one from the Konoha Aviary or not, and Hayate had a couple of knife wounds that people argued were too common to be included.</p><p>"Kunai?" I offered, tracing the line along my neck. "It was a weird gold alloy."</p><p>"No knife wounds," Genma said, "way too common."</p><p>I bit my lip, then shrugged. It wasn't like people didn't <em> know.</em> I shimmed out of my vest and turned my back to them. "Sword," I said, dragging the back of my shirt up so that the scar was visible.</p><p>There was a metallic 'tnk'ing noise, like someone dropping something light and metal.</p><p>"I could show you the front," I said wryly, smoothing it back down, "but we'd all get in trouble." I slipped my vest back on.</p><p>"Okay, I think you win," Hayate said, after a pause.</p><p>"I know they say Tsunade is good," Genma said with a strangled voice, hands groping the table for his lost senbon, "but that's <em> good.</em> That was a through and through?"</p><p>I nodded, suddenly unsure that that had been a good idea after all. Maybe I'd just got carried away with the atmosphere. I stopped the senbon rolling away and offered it to him, eyes kept low. "Yeah."</p><p>"Well that round goes to the newbie," Anko said, impressed. "I'll buy you a drink. Something hard?" She winked.</p><p>I gave a lopsided smile. "Just coffee, thanks. I have training in," I checked the clock, "… two… hours…"</p><p>That was terrible. We'd been here for <em> three</em> ? I was absolutely not sleeping tonight, was I? Damn. I'd have to cope with a nap after sensory training.</p><p>"Who's making you get up at five for training?" Aoba said with a frown. "Tonbo doesn't meet you till eight; I asked him."</p><p>I blinked. 'Don't tell anyone,' Kakashi-sensei had said. And yeah, that was mostly only a joke because he didn't want to be hassled about it but, yknow, he didn't want to be hassled about it. "Never mind," I said. "It's not important."</p><p>They looked at each other with the most significant of looks. I sighed. I would absolutely regret letting them come up with their own explanations for this, wouldn't I?</p><p>"You're a terrible liar," Aoba said, breaking the silence. "Word of advice, don't bring it up if you can't explain it."</p><p>"Thanks," I said drolly. "I'll keep that in mind."</p><p>After that, there wasn't really much point in trying to leave or go home. I wouldn't get anything done before I had to turn around and leave again. So, I just hung around while people started to filter out and leave, and when it was uncomfortably quiet in the bar I left to get something to eat from one of the early opening bakeries.</p><p>I'd just go to training a little early and warm up.</p><p>I yawned, purchasing some warm buns to eat, and let my chakra sense wander. <em> It has to be</em> <em> first nature</em> , Tonbo-sensei liked to say, <em> not second. </em> You had to be paying attention to it constantly, be aware of what was going on around you, for it to be an effective warning system.</p><p>There weren't that many people around, this early in the morning. A few ninja darting over the rooftops. A few people starting work. A small gaggle of ninja two streets back.</p><p><em> That's definitely Aoba-senpai. And Anko.</em> I paused, chewing thoughtfully on my breakfast. Paranoia said 'they're following you'. Which…. The easier answer was just that they were continuing their party somewhere else. I couldn't name the other ninja from here, not being so unfamiliar with them, but it was likely to be a few from the group I'd been hanging out with all night. They were clearly all friends, so really, they were probably just continuing to catch up.</p><p>I moved on, dismissing the thought until I was closer to the training fields.</p><p>And they were still… there. A few streets back. Following me.</p><p>Hair stood up on the back of my neck. <em> Paranoia</em> , I scolded myself. <em> Why would they be?</em></p><p>But I couldn't help it. <em> They're following you</em> , my brain insisted. I didn't want them to be following me. So I had to lose them.</p><p>I didn't head towards our training field. I leisurely finished eating, did a few stretches, disengaged my resistance seals, then shot off in a sudden burst of speed in the complete opposite direction. I wove through the trees, attention half on them and half on where I was going.</p><p>I had a vague plan. I needed a distraction. Something to catch their attention so I could slip away.</p><p>And who else was awake and training at this hour?</p><p>I wasn't quite at Team Gai's training field when I felt Lee's chakra, moving around at a high speed. He was probably doing laps, or something. I changed course so that I could intercept him.</p><p>"Good morning!" Lee beamed at me, looking surprisingly pleased. "Is it not a lovely morning for exercise?"</p><p>I fell into step beside him. "Sure is," I agreed. "Hey, I'm playing escape-and-evasion with some people, can you help me?"</p><p>He agreed cheerfully, though my hastily cobbled together plan had a bit of a hiccup when I was reminded Lee couldn't actually use transformation jutsu. Never mind, I could fix that with a seal.</p><p>We stopped running. I kept a mental check on how close our followers were. We'd put a bit of distance between us, but this had to be done before they had line of sight.</p><p>"May I?" I asked politely, and when Lee extended a hand I painted an anchoring seal on it in blood and dropped a transformation jutsu over him. My own face beamed back at me.</p><p>I became him in turn. "Okay, so just disrupt the seal when you want to cancel it. You don't have to do anything special, just go back to training. Let's see if they notice, yeah?"</p><p>If they weren't putting serious effort into following me, it might. This wasn't a trick that would fool a <em> real</em> pursuit but… they'd given themselves away so easily that it probably wasn't. Hopefully.</p><p>I waved Lee goodbye and turned around, tree jumping until I passed them at relatively close range. None of them broke off to follow me – that I could tell, and I was focusing plenty hard – so I did head towards our training grounds this time.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei was already there, looking slightly confused.</p><p>I hit the ground and dropped my transformation. "Sorry," I panted. "I had to lose some tails."</p><p>He tilted his head back oddly. "Late night out?" He asked.</p><p>"The Special Jounin got together to talk about the Bingo Books," I said. "I didn't realize it would go on for so long. And then… I don't know, they were following me."</p><p>I was upset about it, I realized. Because it hadn't just been paranoia and I couldn't work out <em> why.</em> Was it dangerous? Had I done something?</p><p>Kakashi-sensei snorted. "They're all nosy," he said and shook his head. "Never mind. Has anyone taught you how to scent block? Or sound suppressing techniques? Evasion techniques? How did you get away?"</p><p>Oh, <em> that</em> was what he'd been doing. He'd smelt me. Weird. Slightly unnerving, actually.</p><p>"Uhm," I said. "Only what you taught us before the Konoha Exams, really. I, uh, I ran into Lee and got him to help me. They should currently be following him to Team Gai's training."</p><p>There was a look of peculiar <em> glee</em> that came into his eye. "I think you're my favourite Genin," he said, sounding like he really wanted to laugh. "Gai is going to have so much fun with that. I'll make sure to ask them how they liked their run, later."</p><p>"They shouldn't have followed me," I said, a tad petulantly.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei nodded. "We'll do that, instead. More important. So the first thing you'll want to do is…" he started.</p><p>I sat down, glad this seemed less exhausting than kenjutsu, and learnt.</p><p><hr /></p><p>It wasn't the first time I'd ever pulled an all-nighter though it seemed like a <em> much</em> less wise decision less than half way through sensory training with Tonbo-sensei.</p><p>Tsume Inuzuka turned up, Kuromaru at her heel and a mission scroll in her hand.</p><p>She eyed me critically. I tried to look less like I'd been awake all night and really wanted a nap.</p><p>"Are you mission capable?" She barked.</p><p>"Yes, Tsume-sama," I said, because I was. It wasn't ideal, granted, but I wasn't impaired either.</p><p>"Meet me at the gates in thirty minutes," she said. "We'll need to travel fast, so pack light. It should only take us a few days."</p><p>I nodded, the mission parameters forming a vague outline in my head. It wasn't much information. Not enough to guess what we were going to be doing, or where.</p><p>I bowed goodbye and darted home. My mission pack was already ready to go, and storage scrolls meant it was always 'light'. But thirty minutes was more than enough time to have a shower and get clean and slightly more awake, so I did. If Kakashi-sensei could smell the bar on me, I had no doubt Tsume could, and that was a slightly embarrassing thing for your boss to know.</p><p>Bad timing that the mission had come today than, yknow, any other day. But that was just how things were, sometimes.</p><p>I felt like I should have left a note for the Intel Division that I wasn't going to be there – but if I was registered as being on a mission then that information would be passed along anyway. There were systems in place for when missions just happened.</p><p>"The tracking team often gets rapidly deployed," Tsume said, as we left the village. It wasn't quite an admonishment – I got the feeling she wasn't the type to be gentle if she really felt there was something to be criticized – but it was also clear why she was saying it. "And being a specialist – the <em> only</em> specialist – means that if a mission needs you it needs <em> you.</em> You'll have to learn to cope with being basically on call. I'm not saying don't do anything or don't have fun," she clarified, "but it's a good rule of thumb not to get into a state that you can't easily reverse."</p><p>"I understand, Tsume-sama," I said. It wasn't like the promotion didn't come with catches. Responsibilities. "I am mission ready." Chakra could do a lot to get rid of exhaustion. It wasn't a long term fix – unless you were Gaara, maybe – but I wouldn't be falling asleep in the middle of a fight, or too exhausted to think straight.</p><p>"I wouldn't have brought you if I thought otherwise," she said frankly. "And you can stop with all the 'sama'ing."</p><p>"Tsume-senpai, then," I said, because it was what all the other sensor-nin called her. It still felt a little too informal. "What <em> is</em> our mission?"</p><p>She smirked. "The Sangaku Outpost sent a hawk for an emergency response. They caught a Rock shinobi scouting around and want someone who can find out where he came from, and if there was anyone with him."</p><p>I nodded, slowly. "The Sangaku Outpost isn't on the border." Which probably was why they really wanted to find out where he'd come from – because it meant he had got through the border first. But it wasn't a small outpost either, because it was a fallback base in the mountain range that provided support to the border outposts. "They don't have a tracker on roster?" Or they couldn't ask for one from somewhere closer?</p><p>"They've got two," Tsume corrected. "A Hyuuga and an Aburame."</p><p>And she'd deployed an Inuzuka and a sensor. Really covering all bases there. Maybe I was even understating how <em> much</em> people would want to know how this shinobi had got so far into the Land of Fire.</p><p>But it also meant we would have to travel fast if I was going to be of any use. Chakra signatures didn't linger <em> that</em> long before they dissipated, especially for smaller jutsu. It varied but given the time it would have taken to search, decide they couldn't find anything, send a hawk to Konoha and deploy us… I would be really lucky if there was anything left by the time we got there.</p><p>We pushed a fast pace, not stopping unless we had to and reached the outpost just after night had fallen.</p><p>I hung back while Tsume touched base with the outpost commander – an older Jounin named Hayama Shirakumo – and met up with the two sensor squad ninja that had initially tried to track this guy.</p><p>"Tokuma. Muta," Tsume greeted. There were no points for guessing who was who; they were both picture perfect examples of their clans. Tokuma could have been Neji grown up, and Muta was dressed in a heavy Aburame overcoat and glasses, and carrying a buzzing gourd on his back.</p><p>And focusing on an Aburame with my sensing abilities was an interesting experience now. They weren't just a single static signal like people usually were – they were a hive, truly. A hundred thousand small points swarming in constant motion, each individual kikaichu too small count on its own, but contributing to the overall result. It was… different.</p><p>It was probably going to give me a headache.</p><p>"The outer patrol encountered the shinobi this morning," Hayama explained. "He tried to flee immediately, but the squad was able to pursue him. He fought with a distinct Rock style but was killed in the conflict rather than be captured. He was wearing no identifying symbols, including headband, and carrying no ID or paperwork."</p><p>"Missing nin?" Tsume asked.</p><p>"It's possible," Hayama agreed calmly, "though he isn't in the latest issue of the Bingo Book. My gut feeling is 'no'."</p><p>Which was an answer that meant it was highly likely that Rock was running some black ops bullshit in Fire Country that involved not identifying as Rock shinobi in any way. Or <em> someone</em> was, and trying to blame it on Rock. Either way, not good.</p><p>"Right," she agreed, a little sourly, no doubt thinking the same thing. "And what did you two find?"</p><p>"Starting from the location of the fight we were able to retrace the steps of the patrol squad to the point of initial contact," Muta said, after a quick glance at his comrade. "From there the trail went north for approximately two kilometers before fading. We suspect that he was using Earth Walking Jutsu prior to that point, however, neither my kikaichu nor Tokuma's Byakugan were able to pick up a satisfactory trail."</p><p>"We'll start at the first contact point," Tsume said, giving a nod to Hayama. "Let's find out how this sucker got so far in."</p><p>We took off, Tokuma taking point and leading the team. I fell back, fanning out into the side of a 'v' formation, perfectly willing to just follow along because it was dark and I had no idea where I was going.</p><p>The place we stopped looked no different to the other places we'd passed, but it was obviously correct. Tsume and Kuromaru paced around, picking up scents. Tsume grinned, a sharp toothed thing. "Got him," she said. "They fled that way, yeah?" She jerked a thumb over her shoulder.</p><p>"Correct," Tokuma said.</p><p>I squinted, and tried to pick up <em> anything.</em> Nothing. If I'd been by myself, I might have set up some LED's but no one else seemed to be having trouble with the dark. There was Shadow Sight, if I had to, but I had no idea how long we would be out here for and how long I could hold it.</p><p>We went north, about two kilometers. We stuck to the ground, this time, not the trees which was clearly how our subject had travelled. But if he hadn't been using jutsu, then there was nothing for me to pick up on, and I was completely and totally extraneous.</p><p>"He went underground here," Kuromaru said gruffly, nose pressed to the ground.</p><p>Tsume drew in a deep breath through her nose. "Yeah," she agreed. "I'm getting nothing from the surroundings, either. He didn't surface anywhere upwind."</p><p>"We performed several sweeps of the area," Tokuma said, "and could find no further signs of him."</p><p>Tsume nodded, almost in resignation. "Alright. Shikako, you're up. See what you can see."</p><p>I nodded and slid forward, until I was standing next to where they'd indicated the jutsu started. On one hand, this jutsu had been used more than twelve hours ago. On the other – an Earth Walking Jutsu was probably one of the best options for lingering chakra emissions. To use it, you had to force chakra into the dirt and change it and move it, which meant it retained more chakra. And just like heat dissipated slower in solids than in air, so did chakra.</p><p>Different types of earth and stone had different dissipation values, and wow, I had never thought I would be putting my chakra stone storage knowledge to use like this.</p><p>Go figure.</p><p>There was too much noise. The ambient levels of chakra in the air were so much lower here than in Konoha – a side effect of so many ninja in one place basically excreting chakra everywhere – but there were four of us hovering around while I tried to pick out faint whispers.</p><p>I reduced my down to a tight ball in my chest. That helped, a little. I knelt down, damp grass immediately soaking the knees of my pants through. But in a way, the small discomfort was a focusing point too, something physical and grounding. Cold and wet and uncomfortable, but undeniably right here.</p><p><em> Yes, maybe</em> . I thought I could feel it. Something particular about this point that wasn't present elsewhere. Like trying to feel residual heat in something – there wasn't enough to call it 'hot', only to say that it was warmer than the thing next to it. I followed that feeling down, three, nearly four meters. Then it was a game of picking which direction it traveled in – checking all and finding which was warmest.</p><p>I followed it, which was a slow and uncertain trip because the trail <em> wobbled, </em> probably to avoid roots and things<em> .</em> It just wasn't always in ways that were appropriate for me to mimic above ground, since I had to avoid trees and things.</p><p>No, I didn't walk into one. I would deny that <em> forever.</em></p><p>We went on and on and it was slow and exhausting and I was concentrating so hard on trying to sift through these faint emanations that grew fainter by the hour. The trip would have taken us only a fifth of the time to run, maybe, if we'd known where we were going. It wasn't the distance that was the problem.</p><p>"I – shit," I said, as I lost it. I swept the area, around and around, trying to pick it up again. This way? Or this? I weighed both paths against the other, trying to see if one had more. But it was so faint now… I couldn't tell. "It's gone."</p><p>I tried again, tried <em> harder</em> , because this was my first mission as a sensor and it was going to be a failure.</p><p>"Wait," Tokuma said, suddenly, and a hand fell on my shoulder.</p><p>I looked up, and his Byakugan was blazing.</p><p>"We need to get back to the outpost," he said, grimly. "They didn't come through the border. They have a bunker <em> here</em> ."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sensory Squad Arc: Chapter 102</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: A bit short, but I got caught up in Real Life things ™ and I figured you'd appreciate a chapter sooner rather than later.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 102</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The only sure thing about luck is that it will change. ~ Bret Harte</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>A <em> bunker</em> ? We'd expected to find a path way out, maybe some kind of security breach that had let people slip through the border. Not a camp. Not a fortification. 'Illegal' didn't mean very much in this world of ninja, but the peace between nations was kept by not crossing such obvious lines so blatantly.</p><p>Sending a force into a non-allied nation, without warning or agreement… well. That could look a lot like an attack, couldn't it? Or the start of an invasion.</p><p>Nothing good.</p><p>"Details," Tsume barked, immediately, looking tense.</p><p>I spread my senses, no longer trying to focus in narrowly to find the faintest traces of chakra, and searched for it. It wasn't below us directly but I'd brought us close to it. There was a spread of energy about the size of a building, deep in the earth. It was clearly shielded in some way and if I hadn't been looking – if we hadn't been searching in this area – we would likely have walked right over it and noticed nothing.</p><p>Tokuma gave the location of it, words clipped and tense. "There are five ninja inside of it," he reported.</p><p>Five ninja. Six, if you counted the one that had already been killed. Was that all of them? Or were there more? Were they especially strong – to be sent alone deep into enemy territory? Or were they expected to rely mostly on stealth, on not being noticed in the first place?</p><p>How long had they been here? A village wouldn't send its strongest out long term; it simply couldn't afford to. And the strongest, the headliners, would be noticed and missed. But that didn't necessarily mean they weren't strong, either. How could you know the strength of people who only lived in the shadows?</p><p>And, what, most importantly, were they doing here?</p><p>"One of them is monitoring a seismometer," Tokuma went on. "I believe they're aware that we're here."</p><p>A seismometer monitored vibrations. I knew of them as measuring earthquakes, large scale things, but I supposed it was not too different to monitor smaller vibrations – like footsteps. It would take skill to interpret, but it was technology (or fuuinjutsu, maybe) and wouldn't rely on having to possess specialized skills like sensing so the entire team would be able to use it.</p><p>But it was another piece of bad news for us.</p><p>A sneak attack was out. They'd known we were here before we knew they were. We might have been walking into an ambush – might still be if they judged it worth it to take us out. Was the area trapped? Probably. Nothing obvious enough to give them away, but no one ever left a base undefended. Even a self-destruct would be bad news if it was strong enough.</p><p>"Right," Tsume said. "Shikako, you're going to drop from chakra exhaustion. They know we're here, but they might not know we're tracking them. We've been moving slow and uneven, on the ground; it's a reasonable bluff we've got injured. How long can you keep your chakra compressed?"</p><p>I staggered forward, a couple of weak and wobbling steps, before buckling and hitting the ground. "Ever?" I hazarded. It didn't take any energy to keep my chakra hidden. But I'd never tried to time it, either.</p><p>"Do it," she said, and strode forward to pick me up. I dangled from her hand for a minute, like a puppy, before I was unceremoniously dropped over Kuromaru's back. "We're not an attack squad. We don't want to be trying to fight them on our own. First priority is to get back to the outpost – then we can deal with this shit. Gather what information you can while we're here, but keep moving."</p><p>She gave a swift nod to the rest of the team, and leapt up into the trees. I clung tight to Kuromaru's fur as he followed, powerful muscles bunching beneath the skin. It would have been fun if the situation wasn't quite so serious.</p><p>Attacking the bunker was going to be hard, I could see that. We'd have to be able to <em> reach</em> it first. Which wasn't a given, when it was buried so deep with Rock ninja of unknown strength and ability inside it. Talk about fighting someone on their own turf. It was going to be especially difficult if we wanted to keep the place undamaged and find out what they were doing inside. There had to be some kind of records or information in there, right?</p><p>But it would be protected too, and if we came in full force with an attack squad, they'd have enough warning to bug out and get to safety.</p><p>A complicated situation.</p><p>Maybe I could try to seal it… but that would involve <em> surrounding</em> it with an unbroken seal, to delineate the edges. It wasn't the kind of seal that was safe to use unenclosed and it was most certainly not something you could use without being entirely <em> outside</em> of it. Given the size of the bunker, that would be a whole lot of paper. And even if I could get the seal, getting it in place would be another matter entirely.</p><p>Theoretically, sealing it away was a perfect solution between the risk of combat and risk of lost intelligence. Practically… it wasn't going to be possible. Unless I came up with a new anchor for it…</p><p>But maybe it would be better to raise the bunker up and bring it to the surface. That would open it up for attack. It would require an amplified earth jutsu but that was easier to do – assuming they couldn't counter it…</p><p>I ran through the scenarios furiously, mind churning over the situation.</p><p>There are moments in life when you're so focused on one thing that it is something entirely opposite that takes you by surprise.</p><p>Above us, a hawk called out, the sound a familiar echo of the Konoha Aviary. It shouldn't have been unusual – the sound of a bird in the forest – but it was. Of course it was.</p><p>It was a messenger hawk.</p><p>My attention snapped upwards, away from the ground beneath us. Tsume redirected, feet leaping from branch to tree trunk, momentum to the vertical instead. Kuromaru skittered to a halt, nearly unseating me. Muta bypassed us, kikaichu rising out of his gourd to buzz in the air.</p><p>But the Rock ninja was probably more surprised when he dropped down out of the canopy to land square in the middle of a Konoha team.</p><p>Dawning horror started to form on his face, visible in the barest opening of the mouth, the widening of his eyes. I leapt forward, sliding from Kuromaru's back with all the speed I could muster, crashing into him and catching him with my shadow. It was dark out, which meant the only shadow that existed was what I forced into reality with my chakra, but it was enough for Shadow Possession when we were touching. Enough, even, to wrap another band of Shadow Neckbind around his mouth to silence him.</p><p>Kikaichu swarmed in the air and the hawk gave another cry – distressed – as it was brought down, message and all.</p><p>"They saw it!" Tokuma warned.</p><p>Tsume cursed.</p><p>I slid a hand into my pouch, pulled out a Knockout Tag and slapped it on my prisoner. He fell, and I let him drape over the branch.</p><p><em> Looks like we're fighting after all.</em> And we'd been so close to getting away, too.</p><p>"Muta! Give us cover!" Tsume ordered, spinning and heading back the way we'd come, towards the bunker.</p><p>More kikaichu swarmed, buzzing from the gourd on his back and spreading out into the air in undulating waves and settling down on the ground.</p><p><em> Ah, shit.</em> It was some kind of sensory blocking technique – the kikaichu carrying just enough chakra to be a staticky white noise, and grouping randomly together in clumps, mimicking the strength of a chakra signal that meant 'person'. It probably had an equal effect on the Rock nin – all that buzzing would no doubt make it difficult to pick out a footstep out of the mess. And even non-sensor type ninja relied on being able to sense the chakra of their opponents, especially when they were trying to come up from underground.</p><p>It didn't make me feel any less like - yeah okay - any less like a moth beating around a fire, betrayed by my own senses into thinking it was the sun.</p><p>An arm wrapped around my shoulder – a thick heavy white sleeve; Muta – and dragged me backwards, from branch to branch.</p><p>I went with it, hands flying through the seals for Shadow Sight, pulling the technique across my eyes and bringing the world into stark greyscale.</p><p><em> Better.</em></p><p>"I'm fine," I said, tapping his arm so he would release me. I found my feet and kept moving, keeping pace with the team.</p><p>"Apologies," he said, voice low. "My Insect Jamming Technique blocks chakra-sensing abilities."</p><p>"I noticed," I said dryly. It was a little annoying, and a little hampering, but as long as I could maintain the Shadow Sight, it shouldn't actually have been a <em> problem.</em> It was just slightly ironic that I was so quickly deprived of the sense I was here for.</p><p>"One of them is breaking away and heading north," Tokuma said, Byakugan focused on a far off point. "Three are heading for us. I think the last is trying to destroy the bunker."</p><p>"Go after the runner," Tsume commanded him. "We'll deal with the rest."</p><p>She looked grim.</p><p>I couldn't sense the incoming enemies – but I knew where the base was. I could deal with that, before it was too destroyed.</p><p>I speed up and hit the ground, springing ahead and drawing my lightsaber. I had no seals prepared to bring the bunker up. We'd have to go down to reach it. I could use Earth Walking – but that would be a serious mistake if any of these people were Earth ninjutsu specialists. I'd be flattened.</p><p>Instead –</p><p>Well, lightning jutsu could cut just as well as shock.</p><p>I lit up the sword and focused my chakra in the blade until it was honed and sharp. Under the cover of Shadow Sight it wasn't <em> bright,</em> but a solid shape of white like so much chakra formed a physical thing.</p><p>I swung it at the ground, overhead and down, like it was a goddamn sledgehammer. "Lightning style: <em> Cutting Blade Wave!</em> "</p><p>A line of light lashed out from the path of the blade, like a crescent moon hanging in the air. It was so close that I could feel the heat of it on my skin, the static of it making my hair stand and spread. Then it crashed and plowed into the ground, the force of it kicking up dirt and dust, blowing rocks into shrapnel, carving a gorge that widened and deepened the further from me it went.</p><p>I sprinted forward, following the crack in the ground. I'd judged it just right. It had hit the top of the bunker, <em> just so,</em> cracking the roof of it like taking the top off a boiled egg, but leaving it mostly undamaged.</p><p>I leapt in, dropping down and down, through the opening in the roof. It wasn't big, from the inside. The size of a large room, maybe, but there was a lot of <em> stuff</em> inside. Supplies. Boxes.</p><p>Exploding tags, slapped to the surfaces of everything.</p><p>The shinobi inside – a woman in her late twenties – jerked around in horror. I could see her first, inevitable, action in her eyes. All those exploding tags were supposed to destroy the bunker – a self-destruct mechanism – and she had been trying to get away before setting them off. But now I was here, and if she didn't have a choice…</p><p>I <em> reacted.</em></p><p>"Shadow Stitching Jutsu!" My shadow tendrils unfurled around me, like a sea anemone unfolding, dozens of thin lines lit by the light of my sword. I couldn't see them, but moved them by feel alone, each one spearing out and through a tag and shooting up into the sky. They tangled together as they did so, becoming a column of darkness and easier to control.</p><p>The tags went off. My shadows were shredded, blown back, the rattle of the explosion reaching us even so far below.</p><p>And the kunoichi lunged at me, a full body tackle that slammed me into the wall. The breath whooshed out of me. My arms jarred, akimbo, sword at the wrong angle to strike someone in so close. My chakra was still half formed into Shadow Stitching Jutsu, stretching up into the sky – too slow to re-direct.</p><p>I head-butted her in the face, focusing my chakra on the brief point of contact, forehead leaving the inky imprint of a flash seal behind.</p><p>I triggered it, knowing it went off but the light nullified by the bands of Shadow Sight across my eyes.</p><p>She screamed like her face was melting, stumbling backwards and clawing at it. Her fingernails scrapped lines of blood into her cheeks, wet with sudden tears.</p><p>I pushed off the wall, chasing her retreating form. My chakra settled, formed again, lashed out in a Shadow Possession Jutsu that pinned her in place.</p><p>And then I slapped a Knockout Tag on her, because it seemed kinder.</p><p>I hauled her over my shoulder and ran up the walls. It seemed even deeper when going <em> up.</em> The insects were still buzzing, limiting what I could tell about the battles going on. But I followed the sounds back to the heart of the fight. Tsume and Muta had stuck together, keeping the fight two on three (three on three? Did Kuromaru even the score?) rather than let someone be outnumbered alone.</p><p>I judged the angles, flicked the lightsaber on close behind me and made my shadow <em> loom</em> over the battlefield. I felt them all in my chakra, pinned the enemies in place and left my team alone.</p><p>Muta smothered them in kikaichu, and their chakra shrank and spluttered weakly.</p><p>"What the hell was that?" Tsume snapped immediately, rounding on me. "You can't run ahead on your own! You had no idea what the situation was!"</p><p>I blinked at her, taken aback. "I secured the bunker?" I said. "That was the goal, right?" I made an aborted gestured at the body slung over my shoulder, like she might have missed it. "She was setting the self-destruct."</p><p>"Next time, wait for orders," she said. "Your team might have a <em> plan.</em> "</p><p>"Yes, Tsume-sempai," I said, obediently and… well. I meant it. But I had an opening, I would probably still take it. And I'd had an opening. Or I'd made one, anyway.</p><p>She ran a hand over her face and let out a controlled breath that seemed markedly similar to a sigh. "Fine. The bunker. Were the exploding tags really necessary?"</p><p>"They weren't mine," I protested. "They were hers. I was just getting them out of the way."</p><p>The explosions-Shikako connection had saved my life before, but <em> this time</em> it was incorrect. So there.</p><p>We packed up what we could from the bunker – sealed into storage scrolls – and prepared to haul our prisoners back to the outpost. Which was where I ran into a slight problem, because I already had one slung over my shoulder before I went to pick up the hawk wrangler that I'd left in the trees.</p><p>"Allow me," Muta said, picking him up and dropping him on top of the one he was already carrying. It looked ridiculous, but there weren't really many other options. Tsume had one over her shoulder and one on Kuromaru's back. This was the problem of having more prisoners than we had people to carry them.</p><p>"Thanks," I said, because I wasn't going to argue. I was already trying to carry someone that outweighed me. I didn't want to make that two.</p><p>"Let's hope Tokuma gets the last one," Tsume said. She lifted her chin and sniffed, but apparently the air currents weren't bringing her anything new.</p><p>"He possesses the strongest Byakugan in the Hyuuga Clan," Muta said, on behalf of his comrade. "They will not be able to evade him."</p><p>I wasn't quite sure as to the accuracy of the statement or as to how one would go about measuring something like that, but I also wasn't willing to argue it, either.</p><p>It was a long trip back to the outpost, but the difficulty of carrying so many prisoners back with us was <em> entirely</em> worth it for the expressions on their faces when we showed up.</p><p>"I thought you were <em> scouting</em> , Tsume," Hayama said drolly, as his men stepped forward to take them off us. I relinquished mine in relief and rolled my shoulder to get some feeling back into it.</p><p>She huffed a short laugh. "Thought we'd lend you a hand and take care of it for you," she said. "You're going to have more than enough work on your hands in future."</p><p>He eyed her, apparently reading something into that. "Lovely. Join me in my office?"</p><p>Tsume gave a smile that was both tired and sharp. "Don't be like that. It's just like the good old days."</p><p>"I remember the old days having a lot of mud in them," he said, voice dry. "And damp. And long nights."</p><p>"Oh, yeah," she said. "It's going to be <em> just</em> like that." She turned and pinned me with a look. "Shikako, get some rest. We'll wait till Tokuma reports in, then we're heading back to Konoha. Be ready."</p><p>I nodded and wondered where exactly I was going to sleep. At this point 'up a tree' was a valid choice. Heck, 'right here, on my feet' was a valid choice.</p><p>"I will show you to the barracks," Muta volunteered, proving he was a spectacular human being.</p><p>"You're the best," I said with gratitude.</p><p>The barracks were pretty basic, much like the ones in the tower in the centre of the Forest of Death, but right now I didn't even care. I took off my pouch and leg holster and dropped them on the bed in the corner by the wall, shucked my shoes, and flopped down.</p><p>I was out like a light.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Sensory Squad Arc: Chapter 103</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 103</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong is its current; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place, and this too will be swept away. ~ Marcus Aurelius</em></p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Awake!</em></p><p>I rolled off the bed, one hand grabbing my pouch and the other drawing a kunai. The blanket fluttered into the air. My feet hit the floor bare. My skin tingled where it had been touched, hyper aware.</p><p>Muta drew back, hands up and empty. His kikaichu buzzed, but it was agitation, not attack. "Tsume-senpai has sent for you."</p><p>I stared at him blankly. My eyes wandered from his face to the wall and the room around us. Oh. Right. Outpost. Mission. I sheathed the knife, putting my pouches on and slipping my feet into my shoes.</p><p>"Time's'it?" I asked through a yawn. I rolled my shoulders, stretched out the kinks in my back.</p><p>"Nearly nine," he answered.</p><p>And it had been, what, three? four? when we'd made it back to the outpost. That was almost a full night's sleep. Hah.</p><p>I washed away any lingering traces of sleep with my chakra. "Awesome," I mumbled and followed him out of the barracks back towards the main building. "I don't suppose there's any food?"</p><p>Nine was late. I'd probably missed whatever designated breakfast time. I had supplies, though. I'd manage.</p><p>But he nodded. "We set some aside for you. Kogeru cooked today, so it may even be edible."</p><p>There was a distant 'I heard that!' that came towards us. I smothered a grin. I had no idea who was ribbing who, but that was the kind of comradery I expected. "I'm sure it's fine," I demurred. "Thank you."</p><p>I inhaled it and then went to find Tsume. She was still talking to Hayama - and I doubted <em> she</em> had slept at all - but motioned me closer.</p><p>"We got a hawk from the border," she said shortly. "Tokuma made contact. He tracked the runner the whole way, but they had a fallback base with another two shinobi. He decided against making contact and alerted the patrols, but they managed to slip through. The decision was made not to follow them."</p><p>She shook her head, more in irritation than disagreement, hair flying about her face.</p><p>I absorbed that information. Maybe she was wondering if she should have sent one of us after him, after our own fight went so quickly? But such decisions were always heavily weighted and could look very different in hindsight. If she had, and then one of our prisoners had had a second wind… or if the other shinobi had been on <em> our </em> side of the map… there were ways it could have gone wrong with that, too.</p><p>"I see," I said. "Is there any more we can do?"</p><p>"No," Hayama answered for her. "You completed your mission admirably. More than admirably. The best you can do now is pass the information on to the Hokage."</p><p>"He's right," Tsume said. "This is no longer about tracking."</p><p>It was a whole lot more serious than that, now.</p><p>We headed back for Konoha, not quite at the pace we had started the mission with, but not dawdling either. At least Tsume seemed more talkative, now that the mission was out of the way. Friendlier – if blunt.</p><p>"I would have thought that Hatake put more emphasis on teamwork," she said, out of the blue.</p><p>"He does," I said, with a slight frown. I didn't like the implied criticism – of me or of Kakashi-sensei. "Teamwork is very important."</p><p>"It is, huh?" she said, dryly. "So how does that mesh with running ahead to engage an unknown opponent by yourself?"</p><p>I did frown that time. But maybe it was a test? 'Now explain your reasoning'. Fair enough. It wasn't like I'd never had to do that before.</p><p>"It was the objective most in line with my abilities- I was the person with the abilities most suited for that objective," I corrected, because there was a slight difference. Fighting was well within my abilities – even with Muta's jutsu hampering me – but the others would have had less luck with the bunker. They obviously had skills I didn't know about, but if they'd had an easy way to solve the situation they would have done it. "I had the ability to uncover the target without entering their field of advantage, quickly and while maintaining intel integrity. And there was only a single shinobi inside."</p><p>"And if that shinobi had been a Jounin?" she demanded. "What then?"</p><p>I paused. Weighed my response. "I still had a good set of advantages," I said. "There wasn't a lot of room for them to evade me and I had a good light source for my jutsu. There were only a few situations where I would have been in real trouble, say if they had used an earth jutsu to crush the walls together, and in that case I had an escape route."</p><p>Probably. Turning into shadows via the Gelel stone wasn't a thing I had used in <em> actual</em> combat yet, but it worked.</p><p>"Well, at least you put more thought into it than Kiba," she said finally.</p><p>"Thanks?" I said, a little uncertainly. I wasn't sure if that was damming with faint praise, or if I should be protesting on his behalf. Though, it put her annoyance in a different light, if she was reacting like I was <em> Kiba.</em></p><p>Maybe I should be a little worried that I was doing a thing that Kiba might have done. Then again, I had battle strategies designed around 'what would Naruto do'. There wasn't much room to throw stones.</p><p>"Ah," she said with a sly smirk. "He's a good kid. Housetrained. Knows how to follow orders. Great with small animals."</p><p>"Yes?" I said, because that was. Um. A non sequitur. To put it kindly.</p><p>She gave a satisfied nod. "You'd be a good match. Who knows, your kids might even inherit some intelligence."</p><p>My feet carried me through the next three tree hops automatically, belying the way my brain had frozen in a kind of horror at the words. "Um," I squeaked, eyes going slightly too wide.</p><p>Oh, no. Nope. Even getting grilled over my fighting tactics was better than this.</p><p>"So what was your plan for dealing with the bunker?" I said desperately.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Good mission?" Izumo asked, as he took our ID cards. The orange of the setting sun would have been pretty, if it wasn't shining straight into my eyes.</p><p>I shrugged a shoulder. "Tracking mission, you know," I said. "Look for thing. Find thing. Success."</p><p>He laughed. "That's what we like to hear," he said handing my ID back.</p><p>Tsume nodded to him, and took off briskly to the tower. I trailed in her wake.</p><p>"Nice cover," she muttered.</p><p>I stared at her back blankly. Sure, she'd said not to tell anyone, but I hadn't exactly been lying either, had I? Technically speaking, our mission had gone perfectly. We'd just… found slightly more than expected.</p><p>At the tower, she didn't even bother with the mission desks, just charging straight up the stairs towards the Hokage's office. The door was closed, but the secretary waved us in.</p><p>We walked straight into a serious meeting. Dad was there, and the Head of the Intelligence Division and a handful of other important Jounin that I only vaguely recognized.</p><p>"Tsume," Tsunade said. "We've been waiting for you. Can you confirm the information we received from the Sangaku Outpost?"</p><p>"I can," she said, and launched into a detailed recounting of the mission, including a lot of details as supplied by the outpost commander that I hadn't previously been aware of.</p><p>I inched sideways while she was speaking until I was standing silently next to Dad. He put a hand on my shoulder, but otherwise didn't take any attention off of Tsume.</p><p>"There were no definitive signs of what village they belonged to," Tsume said. "But the bunker remains available for fine toothed analysis, and the prisoners were taken into custody."</p><p>Tsunade nodded. "We dispatched Inoichi as soon as we received the hawk," she said. "But the tactic is certainly familiar. We need to prepare ourselves. If Hidden Rock is taking advantage of our preoccupation with Hidden Cloud to dig themselves in behind our front lines…"</p><p>She trailed off.</p><p>It didn't need to be said that that wasn't good. They weren't just <em> reacting</em> to us being locked into a cold war with Hidden Cloud – they were preparing to escalate too. Putting pieces into play in order to be used later on. Maybe the rationale had been 'just in case' but from here… it rather looked like a cold attempt at starting early.</p><p>I didn't sigh, even though I wanted to.</p><p>I hadn't known anything about a war between nations, in that story <em> Before.</em> Everyone had been allies, at the end. And yet… neither had that story held Temujin's invasion and that had been a big thing too. Had things changed? Or had those events – these events – simply not been relevant to the story that had been told?</p><p>Or maybe this really was just business as usual, and only seemed worse because it was the first time I was seeing it? Maybe the relationship between the villages was a constant struggle of hidden antagonism, flaring and fading as time went on. Surely no one <em> really</em> wanted to go to war.</p><p>The meeting went on and on. I wasn't asked to contribute to anything, but I wasn't kicked out, either.</p><p>There were a lot of topics bandied about. Country wide searches for more bunkers. Border security. Intra-country security. Man power shortages. Supplies. Concern as to what this meant for our stalemate with Hidden Cloud.</p><p>For every question asked, it seemed twenty more sprang into being.</p><p>"Get the immediate responses in place," Tsunade said, once the talks just started to go in circles. "Tsume, liaise with Heihou. Come up with a list of potential other locations and prioritize searching them. Shikaku; the border rotations will need to be reworked."</p><p>"Yes," Dad sighed. "They will." He squeezed my shoulder and directed me towards the door. Apparently that had been a dismissal to action.</p><p>"A lot of excitement for your first mission as a Special Jounin," he commented.</p><p>I gave a half shrug. "The mission itself was okay," I said. "The outpost was nice." The mission objective had been accomplished. No one had gotten hurt. We hadn't had to run off in totally different directions for Reasons.</p><p>Anything that happened next was part of a different problem.</p><p>"Tell your mother not to wait up for me," he said as we reached his office.</p><p>I nodded. "Will do."</p><p>I left the tower, wandering out into the now dark streets. This was about the time I normally headed home from my shift in the Cryptanalysis Team anyway – the darkness was familiar here.</p><p>And then I stopped, because I'd heard a sound.</p><p>I looked around, couldn't see anything, but I was so sure I'd heard it. I spread my senses, focusing on chakra, and followed them out passed the Academy building to the training fields.</p><p>"Hello?" I called, tentatively, feeling a little foolish.</p><p>There was that sound again, and this time I was sure. It sounded like someone crying. For a second – just a second! – I contemplated just going home. But I couldn't. Even in contemplation I knew I couldn't. Maybe I could have when I'd first stopped, but it was too late for that now.</p><p>"Hey," I said, softer, approaching the trees so I could see.</p><p>She was tucked up beneath some bushes, against a tree trunk, like an injured animal that had hidden to lick its wounds in private. It was a feeling I could sympathise with. But that didn't necessarily mean it was a good strategy.</p><p>"Hey," I repeated, crouching down in front of her. "Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong?"</p><p>She was young, maybe eight, with wild black hair and a heavy, covering coat in a cheerful buttercup yellow. Even without the buzzing of kikaichu, I would have been able to tell she was an Aburame. Her arms were tucked in tight, clutching something to her chest.</p><p>She sniffed, breath hitching, and curled in tighter.</p><p>"It's late for you to be out here alone," I said, voice still soft. "People will be wondering where you are."</p><p>"I was 'posed to go to a sleepover," she mumbled, miserably. "But then they said I couldn't." Her chest heaved again, another sob, and it was a dry sounding thing. Like she'd been here for so long that she'd run out of energy for it.</p><p><em> Oh, ouch.</em> Surely she hadn't been here since the Academy finished? Or kunoichi class, which was slightly better, but only slightly.</p><p>"That's sad," I said, sympathetically. "And you didn't want to go home?"</p><p>She twitched her leg. "I hurt my ankle."</p><p><em> Maybe 'said she couldn't' was an understatement</em> .</p><p>I inspected it carefully, letting her know what I was doing. It was sprained, hot and swollen beneath her shoe, the ligaments stretched but not torn. I helped reduce the swelling with my chakra and soothed over the ligaments. I didn't want to do too much because there were… odd structures creeping up her leg, tunnels that buzzed with kikaichu. I'd never tried to heal an Aburame before and I didn't want to cause complications.</p><p>"Is your arm hurt too?" I asked, because she hadn't uncurled. Not even a little bit.</p><p>"They squished Mister Cranberry," she mumbled. And then extended her arms to reveal a red, furry tarantula cradled in her hands.</p><p>I didn't recoil. I <em> couldn't</em> . If this had been a little Inuzuka girl, crying over her puppy, I would have done everything I could to help. How could I do less, just because her pet was a spider? Less palatable to me, maybe, but she clearly loved it just as much.</p><p>It did look … squished. One leg was bent in a direction that I was pretty sure even spider legs didn't go.</p><p>I touched it gingerly, scanning with medical chakra but… yeah, no. I had no idea.</p><p>"Okay, honey," I said. "How about I help you back to your clan and they can have a spider doctor look at him? I'm sure he'll be just fine."</p><p>She sniffed again and wiped her nose on the sleeve of her jacket, but thankfully tucked her pet back against her chest.</p><p>"My name is Shikako," I said, retrieving her backpack and slinging it over my shoulder. "Shikako Nara."</p><p>She seemed like she recognized the name, which was good. There was trust, and then there was 'going somewhere with people you met in the dark of the night'. "You're Shino-nii's friend," she said.</p><p>I blinked in surprised. "That's right. What's your name, sweetheart?"</p><p>"Chiyako."</p><p>The name was vaguely familiar, in a very distant way. The Aburame weren't the most sociable of clans and I didn't really know many of them. Didn't know <em> of</em> many of them either, in the way you did with some clans. But I was aware the clan head had two kids and if she was calling Shino 'nii-san'… Huh.</p><p>I bowed. "Pleased to meet you."</p><p>It spurned a faint giggle out of her, anyway. I dithered for a second, deciding how to lift her. Piggyback – the normal carrying method – would have been fine except she was carrying a spider. And if her hands were around my neck than that meant it would be <em> in my face.</em> So … actually no.</p><p>I lifted her and settled her on my hip. Which meant she could hold onto it and keep it tucked in close to her chest and that was really the best we were going to get.</p><p>Then I set off towards the Aburame compound, trying to keep up a light hearted conversation with her.</p><p>"You smell like kikaichu," she said, face pressed awkwardly into my shoulder.</p><p>"Do I?" I asked.</p><p>And then she… vibrated, all the kikaichu in her body buzzing until I could feel it through her skin.</p><p><em> Unnatural</em> , my mind insisted and I told it to shut the hell up. She was just a little girl.</p><p>"Mmhmm," she agreed. "Upset smells. Like fighting."</p><p>"Ah, I was on a mission," I said, and hoped that that explained it. We crossed the threshold to the Aburame compound and I hesitated, unsure which direction to actually take her. We did, sometimes, have dealings with the Aburame but they were seldom conducted here those that were usually involved the workshop and not the houses.</p><p>"That one," Chiyako said, pointing.</p><p>I shrugged and followed her directions. But there must have been some perimeter or warning or something because I wasn't even halfway there before the door opened and someone stepped out.</p><p>"Hi," I said, a little lamely. "Sorry to stop by so late." I shifted Chiyako on my hip, just a fraction.</p><p>Shibi came closer. "Chiyako-chan," he murmured and lifted her out of my arms. "What happened?"</p><p>I stepped back, job done, and intended to vanish into the night and go home. Somehow, instead, I found myself hustled inside and into a kitchen where a lady in a long housecoat poured me tea despite my protestations.</p><p>"Thank you, but its fine," I said again. "I-"</p><p>"Is something wrong?" Shino's monotone voice interrupted from the doorway.</p><p>I looked up. He was wearing his normal blue coat – over stripy blue pajama pants. Understandable. But incongruous, all the same. Shibi had vanished somewhere with Chiyako, hopefully to make sure she and the spider were okay.</p><p>"Why?" Shino continued. "Because it is unusual to have guests at this hour."</p><p>"I was just bringing Chiyako home," I explained. "She was upset. It seemed her sleepover didn't… go so well."</p><p>"I see," Shino said unhappily. He ducked his chin into the collar of his coat. "She was happy to be invited."</p><p>I nodded. There wasn't much I could say to that. 'Kids can be cruel' seemed trite, and he was just as likely to know it as I was.</p><p>His mother ushered the two of us – with tea – into the living room and started to fix up something for her daughter to eat.</p><p>I made another attempt at leaving. "It's late and I just got back from a mission…" I said leadingly. "I should really get going."</p><p>"Your mission was with an Aburame, wasn't it?" Shino said. "Why do I ask? Because you have lingering traces of kikaichu pheromones on you."</p><p>"Right, Chiyako said." I winced and made an aborted brushing motion with my hand. Like that would do anything. "Sorry. And yeah, it was. A Special Jounin named Muta."</p><p>"It was not a complaint," he said. "It is only concerning to encounter someone who appears distressed." He hesitated a second. "It would be as if seeing someone who covered in blood. You would ask if they were well."</p><p>And that didn't make is sound less disturbing at all. But maybe it explained why I had been herded inside. They might have been worried about their clan mate.</p><p>"No one was hurt," I assured him. "There was a little bit of fighting, but nothing too serious."</p><p>Shino nodded, gravely. "I'm pleased to hear that."</p><p>There was the sound of pattering footsteps, and Chiyako appeared. Her foot was bandaged but she didn't appear to be having any trouble walking on it, and she had changed into blue flannel pajamas with butterflies on them. <em> Cute.</em></p><p>"You're still here!" She said, coming closer and thrusting her hands into my face. "Look! Dad fixed him!"</p><p>The spider waved it's little … feeler legs at me. I tried not to draw back in horror.</p><p>"That's… great," I said weakly. I cast a desperate glance at Shino.</p><p>He gallantly came to my rescue, scooping it out of her hands and away from me. "Allow me to hold him for you, Chiya-chan. Why? Because you must be hungry and Mother is making you dinner."</p><p>Chiyako slipped away into the kitchen.</p><p>"Thanks," I said in an undertone.</p><p>"I did promise," Shino said.</p><p>It startled a laugh out of me. "You did."</p><p>"Mum said I could eat out here," Chiyako said, returning and carrying a plate of food with her. She clambered up on the couch beside me, and I shifted to help her.</p><p>And as much as I wanted to go home, it wasn't exactly a hardship to make a kid feel better after a terrible day. It was late anyway, and she was yawning and leaning against my side before too long.</p><p>She yawned and rubbed her eyes with a closed fist. "Nee-chan, you can have this." She unwrapped something from around her wrist and looped it over mine. It was one of those knotted bracelets that I remembered making with Ino; friendship bracelets. "They're kikaichu," she said, pointing at the blobby spots on it. "I made it for Yumi but…"</p><p>"Thank you," I said. "I love it." The knots were neat and evenly spaced and she'd tied it on in a way that would release quickly if it was pulled, like a true ninja child.</p><p>I smoothed a hand over her hair. Poor kid.</p><p>It was a smaller tragedy, but a tragedy all the same.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I hadn't arranged with Kakashi-sensei whether there would be training or not, but I suspected that 'I got back from a mission yesterday' wasn't a good reason to skip it. That was <em> yesterday.</em></p><p>"I hear there were a lot of explosions yesterday," Kakashi-sensei said, eye curving in amusement.</p><p>"They weren't <em> mine</em> ," I informed him, a little tartly. "And I had to <em> stop</em> things from being destroyed."</p><p>"We all sometimes have to work counter to our natures," he said, patting me on the shoulder. "I'm sure the future has much large scale destruction in store for you."</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him. "Thank you, sensei."</p><p>"I'll probably be off on a mission soon," Kakashi-sensei said, changing the topic. "Tsunade is making all the Jounin show face. So to speak."</p><p>It wouldn't necessarily matter <em> what</em> they were doing, so long as they were a visible reminder of the power that Konoha could command. It was one thing to try and sneak a squad into the country, quite another to do it when Kakashi Hatake was prowling the borders.</p><p>I nodded. "Stay safe."</p><p>"I'll get in touch when I'm back. There's still a lot more you need to learn. Don't slack off on your training while I'm gone!"</p><p>Afterwards, when I headed to sensory training, it turned out that Tonbo-sensei had much the same idea. Not that he was being sent off, as such, but that I wouldn't be training with him.</p><p>"From here on out it'll be mostly a matter of practicing," he said, crossing his arms. "According to Tsume, you exceeded all expectations in tracking chakra residue. I'm not sure how else to help you. If I'm honest, with most of the other recruits we just give them a training plan and send them back to their clans."</p><p>I had noticed that no one else was doing such concentrated sensory training. I'd partially attributed it to the rank up – they were making sure I was worth it.</p><p>"Thank you for all your help," I said genuinely, bowing. "I've learnt a lot."</p><p>But that meant… I had my days free again. And that was really great. I spent the first one doing absolutely nothing and went to my shift feeling happy and relaxed.</p><p>Aoba made a face at me. "That was cruel and unusual."</p><p>"What?" I looked over my shoulder, just in case I'd missed something. No. Nothing there.</p><p>"Gai," he repeated. "<em> Cruel and unusual.</em> "</p><p>"You <em> were</em> following me," I said, frowning at him. I… still wasn't happy about that. I crossed my arms.</p><p>"Not meanly!" he insisted weakly. "It didn't deserve that."</p><p>He appeared to realize that that argument was impressing no one. He sighed. "Fine. But just so you know, I didn't do <em> any</em> of your paperwork while you were gone. Have fun."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Storage Seal Arc: Chapter 104</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: I was going to cover a little more in this chapter, but we reached a very important milestone that I wanted to celebrate and this was as much as I had written.</p><p><strong> Ten thousand reviews.</strong> I am blown away. Thank you all.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 104</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Never underestimate spite as a motivator for genius ~ Sam Kean</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>There were a lot of things I wanted to do now that I actually had the time to do it, but the first was to go and see my friends.</p><p>Ino was busy working in the Intel Division, so I went to Sakura's house instead.</p><p>"Oh ho," she said. "So you finally have time for us."</p><p>"Come on, Sakura," I cajoled. "It was training. I couldn't skip it."</p><p>She crossed her arms. "You're just too important for the likes of us now, are you?"</p><p>"It's not like that and you know it," I said. "We have to train when people are willing to teach us, otherwise how can we learn to be the best ninja possible?"</p><p>Sakura relented, which meant she probably wasn't really annoyed in the first place. A truly stubborn Sakura was not so easily swayed. "Alright, but only because I know you really have been busy. If you were just avoiding me, then I'd be mad." She sniffed but led me inside.</p><p>I made a vague sound of agreement. "So you're all still meeting up, right? The kunoichi group?"</p><p>"Yeah, which you'd <em> know</em> if you talked to us. We have one every week, almost. Whoever is in the village comes."</p><p>I waved the pointed comment off. We'd just covered that. "And how's your training with Tsunade-sama going?"</p><p>"So great," she gushed, immediately. "I mean, it's really hard and everything. But I've learnt so much. And look at this." She slid up her sleeve and lifted one arm, curled it and flexed the muscle.</p><p>"Wow," I said, startled. "You did not have those before." And that was some serious muscle definition for a month of training. "I am impressed."</p><p>She grinned. "Shishou said that the super strength technique works better if I have some actual strength first. It's not pretty but if I wear sleeves then no one can tell, right?"</p><p>She smoothed her sleeve down, eyes wide and hopeful. I wasn't entirely sure what the <em> correct</em> response to that was. 'Looking pretty' had never been one of my greatest concerns. But I wasn't unaware of the cultural impetus to be the things considered 'feminine' – and Sakura had always been drawn much deeper into that.</p><p>"Well, no," I said, slowly. "And even if they could they should just be jealous. There's nothing wrong with having muscles. It's a good thing, even. We're kunoichi. We're <em> supposed</em> to be strong."</p><p>But also, that was some <em> serious</em> muscle definition for a month of training.</p><p>"Is there a medical jutsu for building muscle?" I asked. "There was… when I was in that coma they did something to stop my muscles from atrophying." And I had wanted to learn that. Because there was so much sheer <em> maintenance</em> work that you had to do to keep your strength up. Not even training for improvement, just stuff you had to do to stay in place. If you could cut some of that out...</p><p>"Well, kinda?" Sakura said, hesitantly. "I mean, you can't just <em> build</em> muscle like that. It wouldn't do any good. You have to optimize what you're building them <em> for.</em> Slow twitch or fast twitch, which muscle groups… well, you get the idea."</p><p>"So it's just a matter of efficient healing after training?" I guessed. "Promoting growth based on the exercise you are doing?"</p><p>It was easy to draw her into a medical discussion. She might have been forbidden from teaching me the strength technique, but that didn't extend to anything else. She didn't even think about extending it to anything else.</p><p>After Sakura, I went to see Yakumo. That was less because of an ordered list of people I'd missed and more because a) Anko had reminded me and b) I sorta had a responsibility to her.</p><p>She seemed happy, though. "Uncle asked if I wanted to move out of the mansion and closer to the clan," she said. "But I've gotten used to living here alone. And it means my friends can stop by all the time and no one says anything about it."</p><p>I laughed. "There are benefits," I agreed.</p><p>"Ranmaru stays over a lot when we're practicing genjutsu," she added. "He goes to the academy now."</p><p>It took me a second to place the name. Ranmaru was the kid Naruto had brought back from some mission or the other, and I'd introduced them to each other at the hospital. Huh. I hadn't thought about him since.</p><p>"That's neat," I said. "You're training together?"</p><p>"Our genjutsu are very different," she admitted. "But it's fun to try and work out what we can do."</p><p>"Anko said you were looking forward to the Chunin Exams," I commented. "Have you decided to become a ninja, then?"</p><p>She beamed. "Yes! Isaribi and I are going to get our headbands at the next graduation. Anko-sensei said that no one would be going to the next Exams anyway, because they're in Hidden Cloud, so we have a whole year to get ready for it. We thought Sakura-san might be our third teammate, if she's allowed."</p><p>"She'll be thrilled to be asked," I said, because she probably would be. It would put the team a little heavy on the 'support' side, with a medic and a genjutsu user, but if Sakura had any kind of handle on the strength technique by then… people might be in for a surprise.</p><p>I also asked her if she wanted to be included in some other training. I rather thought that she and Shiho might be on reasonably similar levels when it came to physical training. I'd done a few OR hours with Shiho during my shifts – she wasn't <em> bad</em> exactly, but she wasn't driven and didn't particularly like it. Having someone with her clearly improved the experience, so I was fully prepared to use that to my advantage.</p><p>"It sounds fun," Yakumo said.</p><p>That was good enough for me.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Aoba had apparently relented on the 'you are the worst person in the world' treatment he was giving me – or I'd finished all my paperwork faster than expected – so I was transferred over to the Konoha Aviary.</p><p>"The first thing you have to know," Takajo, the Special Jounin currently on duty, said. "Is that hawks are not ideal messenger birds. They're a pest to train. The reason we use them is…"</p><p>"Because they hunt pigeons," I finished.</p><p>"Got it in one," he said, opening a cage and letting one perch on his forearm. He had thick bandages wrapped around it, but had to be chakra reinforcing too. The talons looked wicked. "Homing pigeons are much better at delivering letters from point A to point B. But of course, then someone got the bright idea to intercept them with hawks, so we trained hawks. Then we had to use them to deliver our own messages, because we couldn't use homing pigeons anymore."</p><p>And if the hawk was delivering messages, it was a small protest that <em> of course</em> you weren't using them to <em> intercept</em> , that was just silly, who would do such a thing. For shame.</p><p>"The second thing you have to know," he went on. And then winced.</p><p>"Is that they bite?" I said dryly.</p><p>"They bite," he agreed.</p><p>So I learnt how to handle the birds. And how to receive and log in the messages received and how to decide where they had to go and with what urgency. And how to wrestle messages off the unruly ones and how to coax the ones that didn't want to come in back into their cages. And the difference between sending out a message run and sending a hawk to circle as a visible symbol.</p><p>"This one is urgent," Takajo said, detaching a message from an incoming hawk.</p><p>"Very urgent," Natori said solemnly, looking over his shoulder.</p><p>Takajo ignored him. "You need to deliver it <em> immediately.</em> " He gave me a room number to deliver it to, somewhere in the tower.</p><p>And I wouldn't, normally, have recognized it off hand. There were a lot of rooms in the tower. Except, Ibiki had taken me down that hallway recently. I was pretty sure that location was T&amp;I.</p><p>"Got it," I said.</p><p>I was therefore not surprised when I had to present my identification and wait until someone came to get it.</p><p>"Ibiki-taicho," I said cheerfully, a little surprised. It was late, and surely there were lower ranked people to fetch messages. "Something for you from the Aviary."</p><p>He took it with a raised eyebrow and opened it right then and there. "You should be careful that they're not hazing you. This could have easily been sent in the morning."</p><p>I shrugged. Honestly, it was nice to stretch my legs and move around, even if that meant delivering messages to people. "Sorry to interrupt you, then, I guess," I said. "You must be busy."</p><p>He made a noise of faint agreement. "It was probably time to take a break from it," he said. "If the Aviary can spare you from such urgent duties, you could stay for a cup of tea." He grinned. "It will be worth it for their faces when you tell them you were detained by us."</p><p>I grinned back at him, co-conspirator, and followed him through the open door. "Not <em> tea,</em> " I said, faux horror, the faint memories of something amusing rising to the surface. A Monty Python sketch. "The next thing you know, I'll be subjected to <em> comfortable chairs.</em> "</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Which made it the perfect moment to swing open the break room and for everyone inside to turn and look at us.</p><p>I waved awkwardly. <em> Whoops.</em></p><p>When I did return to the Aviary to report message successfully delivered and, oh by the way, I'd had a cup of tea there, their faces were every bit as good as Ibiki had predicted.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next day I was busy too. It was Sunday, which gave me a little bit of time to put plan into action. Not that it was a hugely complex plan, or anything like that, but I was meddling. So there.</p><p>First I stopped by Cryptography and offered to courier all the paperwork around, so that I would have legitimate excuses to be going places. As expected, everyone was way too busy to protest about <em> someone else</em> doing extra work.</p><p>Most of them were easy enough to drop into in trays and hand off to people, because this was only the low priority stuff, and I kept hold on anything that was going to the missions desk.</p><p>I didn't, normally, go there if I could help it. The missions desk shinobi were… weird. And didn't like me, very much. If I had to visit, I tended to take a full carafe of coffee from the percolator with me, so that I could bribe them into doing whatever I needed done in exchange for a refill.</p><p>And woe betide me if I touched <em> anything</em> in their office.</p><p>They were weird.</p><p>But I was after someone in particular. And that was where they would be.</p><p>"Iruka-sensei!" I made a bee-line for him, in the little open plan office next to where the actual missions desk was. Iruka-sensei who did <em> more than</em> his part in this overworked mess, who taught at the Academy and then filled in whatever time he had left here.</p><p>He gave me a distracted smile. "Oh, Shikako-chan. What are you doing here?"</p><p>"I have the pick-up assignments from Intel," I said, waving the papers as my justification for being there.</p><p>Behind me, someone let out a sound that was like a moan. I thought I <em> almost</em> heard the words 'she touched them all. They're cursed', but that would have just been silly. Mission desk ninja were weird.</p><p>"Oh, yes that's right," he said and took them from me. "That all looks like it's in order."</p><p>I nodded. "I was wondering if you could do something else for me?" I asked. This was the weak part of the plan. Technically, what I was doing was not official in any way, shape or form and he didn't have to do it. I was just hoping that the associations of 'we are at work' and 'I just gave you work' would pull through and make it seem slightly more legit. "Chiyako Aburame is in your class, right?"</p><p><em> I'm small and non-threatening,</em> I tried to think at him.<em> I was your student. I couldn't possibly be up to anything.</em></p><p>"She is," he said a little cautiously. "I wasn't aware you knew her."</p><p>"Shino is a friend," I waved it off. "But I wondered if you could pass these along; they're some invitations for a few of your students to attend our kunoichi group."</p><p>I pulled out the invitations. They were on thick heavy card in neat calligraphy and very formal looking.</p><p>"I've heard of that," Iruka-sensei said, recognition lighting up his eyes. He took the cards and flicked through them to see the names. "I'd be glad to. I wasn't aware that you were inviting Academy students. There are a few more students that you might want to take a look at, if you're interested. Yumi Masami is the current top kunoichi, she's very clever."</p><p>I rolled a bland smile out over his first statement, because 'heard of that'? Really? But it slipped a little as he went on. The name he mentioned was probably the exact wrong one to bring up. "That would defeat the purpose," I murmured.</p><p>His bright look dimmed a little and I felt bad. "The group is very small right now," I said, a touch apologetically. "So we'll just start with those ones."</p><p>Yeah, I was probably going to regret that vague retraction at some point in future. Like every time I was asked about it.</p><p>"Of course," he said. "I'll pass them out on Monday."</p><p>I gave my thanks and went. That had been mostly a success. Even if it raised a few very odd questions.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Monday came and went and I took advantage of my new found time to throw myself back into my sealing projects. It had been so long since I'd even looked at them that I'd almost forgotten what I was doing and what I intended.</p><p>In some ways, looking at things with fresh eyes probably helped. In others, I was worried I had forgotten something important that I'd been meaning to do with them.</p><p>I frowned at my notes, spreading them out over the living room table. Shikamaru leant against the doorframe, just watching me.</p><p>"Aren't you supposed to be at work?" I asked.</p><p>He shrugged. "I switched to afternoon shift."</p><p>Well. That explained that, then.</p><p>My attention was drawn back to my notes. I rolled my pen over my knuckles, around and around, as I thought.</p><p>"Actually," Shikamaru continued on, not moving. "I need your help."</p><p>"With what?" I asked, attention snapping to him like metal filings to a magnet. I couldn't <em> not.</em></p><p>He came closer and sprawled out on the couch, lacing his fingers together behind his head. "Logistics is in charge of managing the resupply of the outposts and hideouts," he explained. "I was told to manage the restocking schedule; least people, least time, most places… that kinda thing."</p><p>I nodded. I had no idea where that fell in the logistics hierarchy of things to manage, but it didn't sound that complicated.</p><p>"So I asked," he went on, "why they didn't just use storage scrolls. He called me an idiot."</p><p>My mouth dropped open, both in outrage on his behalf and disbelief. "They <em> don't use storage scrolls?</em> "</p><p>There was a flicker of a grin at the corner of his mouth. "Apparently," he made lazy quotation marks with one hand, "there's a 'maximum capacity' that a storage scroll can handle. So they do use them, but they can't put <em> everything</em> in one."</p><p>"Bullshit," I said automatically. "Have you seen what I can put in a storage scroll?"</p><p>Maximum capacity, my ass. I could put all of Konoha in one, if I wanted.</p><p>"Yes," Shikamaru said, amused. "That's why I was under the impression that you could, in fact, put everything in one."</p><p>I rolled the problem over in my head. The back of my mind seethed darkly that anyone dared insult him like that.</p><p><em> We got this, </em> I assured it. <em> They'll regret it.</em></p><p>It subsided. Or maybe it didn't. Maybe all of me just seethed now.</p><p>"What seal are they using?" I asked. "If it's just Konoha standard then <em> there's your problem.</em> "</p><p>He sat up. "Why's that the problem?"</p><p>I made a quick sketch of the seal on a loose piece of paper. "This is the standard seal, right? You can buy it in pretty much any authorized shop and most ninja can make it themselves. But it's only designed to be a personal storage. Your luggage. Or a big weapon… one item, under, say, two hundred kilograms?"</p><p>Even that was probably upper limit. But it wouldn't fail, it would just be less efficient at it, take more chakra and time, in a kind of exponential function until the efficiency was so low that it seemed like it wouldn't work.</p><p>"This is a Kuusho seal, and this is a Kuukan seal," I went on, scribbling two more on the paper. "The first one is for really small items – things that would actually fit within the circle, see? Kunai, basically, or maybe a money bag. The second one is for things that are a bit bigger, but still not as big as what you'd use the standard seal for. A sword, or something like that."</p><p>I glanced up. Shikamaru nodded, like he was following.</p><p>"So really, they're the morons trying to stuff a house in a backpack," I concluded. "The end."</p><p>He smirked. "Okay, so <em> is there</em> a bigger seal?"</p><p>I looked at him blankly. "Well, sure. One that logistics can use? That I don't know."</p><p>"You lost me," he said. "Why couldn't they use it?"</p><p>"Because the tower would have to purchase them and you can't sell seals unless they've been approved," I said. "I don't know if Konoha has any bigger storage seals on record. If no one is using them, then is suggests they don't."</p><p>Shikamaru looked thoughtful, hands coming together in his thinking pose. "You can design one, can't you? And R&amp;D can approve it? Our R&amp;D," he amended. "I know we have a few medical seals on file."</p><p>I looked away. "I don't get on with R&amp;D anymore, you know that," I said, even as I reached for a new piece of paper to start drafting on.</p><p><em> I need your help</em> , he'd said. So to hell with R&amp;D. To hell with everything.</p><p>"I can handle that part," he said, easily.</p><p>"Alright," I agreed, quickly. "So it needs to be fairly simple, easy to use, unique and recognizable, so that no one mixes it up with other seals in a rush. What kind of capacity are we talking about?"</p><p>I ran through the information, jotting it down as bullet points as we went. There were a lot of 'requirements' but most of them were straightforward and obvious anyway. Of course you didn't want to mix seals up – for instance, explosive seals looked different to <em> everything.</em></p><p>"Ah, but aren't we thinking about it backwards," I muttered, pen flying. "Why can't we just seal the entire hideout so that teams can deploy them as needed?"</p><p>Shikamaru blinked. "Uh," he said. "But wouldn't people notice it?"</p><p>I scratched the idea out. "You're right, of course they would. Even if we deployed it underground and shifted the dirt? No, the chakra signal would still be noticeable, I guess. Bad idea."</p><p>"Not… bad," he said. "Just not always applicable. People might <em> like</em> to be able to carry their own camp around with them like that."</p><p>I scratched an asterisk by the idea. "Maybe." Then I stared at the notes, mulling over not just the seal but the <em> bigger</em> problem. The whole picture.</p><p>Shikamaru let me think.</p><p>"I think we need to bring Tenten in," I said. "Her specialty is storage seals. We can sign her up as a contractor with R&amp;D for this project."</p><p>"You can't do it?" he asked, with surprise.</p><p>"I <em> can</em> ," I said. "But it'll look better if it's a collaboration. And they'll need someone to check it anyway, so better if we provide one ahead of time."</p><p>"Okay," he agreed slowly. "If you say so." And I knew he could see there was something more to it. But somehow… I didn't think he'd see what. "I'll register it with Kofuku-oba and get the forms. You see if Tenten agrees to it."</p><p>I nodded and scrapped the rest of my notes into a pile and dropped them in my room before I went and hunted Tenten down.</p><p>I didn't anticipate any difficulties in getting her to agree, but she hesitated.</p><p>"What's wrong?" I asked, because I was sure I had presented it nicely. Contract, experience, her area of expertise, and royalties when it was done and sold. The only downside was that the seal itself wouldn't belong to us, as such, and we couldn't make it to sell ourselves, but since we didn't even have the thing yet it was barely a point.</p><p>"I just don't know how I'd ever manage to pay you back," she blurted out. "You keep helping me, giving me all these chances and I… there's nothing I can do for you."</p><p>I scratched the back of my neck awkwardly and felt bad. <em> Think fast.</em> "Um," I said meekly. "Mostly I was doing it to foist the paperwork off on you. Now I feel bad."</p><p>She blinked, startled and then started laughing. Really laughing, until she was basically doubled over.</p><p>I patted her awkwardly on the shoulder. "Sorry?"</p><p>She managed to straighten up. "No, it's good," she gasped. "It's nice to know you have selfish motives sometimes. Okay, I'm in. Sign me up."</p><p>I didn't wince. But wow, perfect aim, alright. She wasn't intending on hitting sore points and didn't even know it was there, and yet. Point to Tenten.</p><p>I dragged her home. Shikamaru had the papers, so we got started.</p><p>We ran over the requirements again and argued over them. Between the three of us, we decided to break it down into three separate seals. One to cover the current 'small items' class of zero to a hundred kg, a second for a hundred to five hundred and a third for five hundred to a thousand. More or less.</p><p>What did they restock hideouts with anyway? Food, medicine, weapons… firewood, for warmth, maybe. That would be the bulkiest item, surely. Maybe replacement furniture, for the bigger places.</p><p>"We could go higher," I said, "I could see a lot of use for it. I mean, you could offer transport for merchant goods and it would be about the same difficulty as delivering a letter, right? But you could probably still charge the same as for guarding a merchant convoy, because it would be the same outcome to the customer."</p><p>"I'll add it to the 'intended uses'," Shikamaru said around a yawn. He scribbled something down lazily.</p><p>"But re-stocking isn't going to involve a lot of really <em> big</em> objects, is it?" Tenten asked, a little uncertainly. "More like multiple small sets of things. We could make a parent-child seal, in that case…"</p><p>We started debating the pros and cons of that again.</p><p>"You can always do the rest later," Shikamaru said, waving a hand between us. He propped his chin up in the other one. "But do you have to do the one hundred kg one? Isn't that covered by the standard?"</p><p>"Sure," I said. "But it's better to be consistent. For the people using them, I mean. If they see all three seals as being the same, then it's more trustworthy than using two different types."</p><p>Not the tightest of arguments, but it had some truth to it.</p><p>"Sure, but how do we make them look consistent?" Tenten asked. "They'll be very different."</p><p>"Not so much," I disagreed. "I figured it would just be a matter of changing the formula." I scribbled an example down on the paper.</p><p>Tenten stole my pen. "Yeah but look at this," she said. "You can't-"</p><p>I stole it back. "Yes, of course, but you're thinking like they do different things. They don't, it's the same seal only bigger. So it doesn't need to be so different-"</p><p>Shikamaru sighed.</p><p>"Is this going to cause me problems?" Dad asked dryly. He looked over the room, at our messy piles of papers and drafts. At my mulish expression, at Shikamaru's sudden 'totally not guilty' look. At the way Tenten startled to her feet and bowed to him.</p><p>"They should totally thank us," I disagreed. "We're fixing it."</p><p>There was a weighty silence. "I see," he said in a heavy tone that implied he probably did. "Carry on, then."</p><p>It took us a few days to get working prototypes. Which, in a research timeframe, was us working in overdrive and hitting light speed. But our rationale and equations were as tight as they could be without actually being water proof. I'd pulled forth supporting evidence from the clan library to reference, under Takatori's watchful gaze.</p><p>No one could find a problem with it.</p><p>"They said it would be two months before they could look at it," Shikamaru reported. He slouched, hands in his pockets, his magical results suddenly much further out of reach than they had been a moment ago.</p><p>In a research timeframe, that was… acceptable.</p><p>But I wanted it <em> now.</em></p><p>"Tell them you can get my control seal finished if they do it by next week," I offered, impulsively. "And if that doesn't work, throw in an Element Affinity Gauge."</p><p>He blinked. "A what?"</p><p>I pulled out a clean sheet of paper and sketched a pentagon on it, labelling each corner with the sign of an element. It wasn't an unfamiliar diagram to anyone – they were often used to describe skill trees and strengths.</p><p>I switched to a thinner brush and carefully wrote a rough attraction formula in the centre of it. I'd had the basic idea for it a long time ago, it had just never been made.</p><p>"See?" I said, channeling a small piece of chakra into the seal, which went black. As expected, it blobbed out sideways, drawn towards the 'earth' symbol. "It needs a bit of refining, but eh. It should be enough to interest them."</p><p>I withdrew my chakra and the seal reset itself.</p><p>Shikamaru was staring at me. He very slowly reached out and took it. "Right," he said. "I'll do that."</p><p>Tenten thwacked me in the shoulder. "I can't believe you invented a seal <em> just like that.</em> We spent days arguing over these ones! And it took me <em> months</em> to write one."</p><p>"I already had it," I protested. "I just hadn't written it. Besides, it's not exactly as <em> complicated </em> as yours. "</p><p>Which reminded me that I really wanted to learn it. "Speaking of," I said. "Tenten, my friend. Teach me your ways."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

Glasow</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"People are going to start thinking we're up to something, if we keep this up," Ino mused idly.</p><p>"I think they already do," I said absently, Iruka-sensei's comment springing to mind. My eyes wandered over the group. It was… bigger than I remembered it being. Yes, we'd invited Yakumo. And Ino had started to bring Isaribi along while I'd been busy, because she felt the same kind of responsibility for her.</p><p>Anko was, therefore, here by default. I wasn't sure if she was still on permanent guard duty or if this was just a 'risky' occasion, but she was almost expected. Kurenai-sensei wasn't. I mean, I could see how she fit into it, and it wasn't like we were going to turn down the chance to get training from her…</p><p>"Who's that with Sakura?" I asked.</p><p>"Keiko Fukui," Ino said. "She's another trainee medic. Seems nice."</p><p>"I was going to bring Shiho, too," I said. "But this seemed a little more urgent. Next time?"</p><p>Ino shrugged. "It's not really just a 'medical study group' anymore, is it?"</p><p>It really wasn't. It hadn't stayed that way for very long, in fact. But it was still training, still a chance for us all to catch up together no matter what else was going on in our lives.</p><p>"Here they come," I said, voice quiet, as three Academy students approached the park. I waved.</p><p>Moegi waved back vibrantly and pulled the other two closer with the sheer force of her personality. I'd been a little surprised that Hanabi hadn't come with her sister, but Hinata had said that the three wanted to meet up first. Which was a) cute and b) <em> even better</em> than what I'd hoped for.</p><p>You couldn't just throw people together and expect them to be friends. But I could encourage it – make them comrades and give them something in common that none of the other students had. And even if it didn't make them friends… friendly acquaintances was better than nothing.</p><p>"Ah, Chiya-chan, before we start," I said solemnly. "I wanted to thank you for my bracelet." It was still tied neatly around my wrist, perfectly visible. I drew a similar one from my pocket – I'd made it this morning. "But these things are always given in pairs. So, this one is yours."</p><p>I bent and tied it carefully around her wrist. "See the little bead on it? Try and channel some chakra into that."</p><p>She did. The LED seal on it lit up, brightly. It had been a pest to try and write it on something so small, but it was… a personal touch. Something useful.</p><p>Chiyako darted forward and wrapped herself around my legs. "Nee-chan!" She wailed into my kneecaps.</p><p>I tried not to topple over. Ino muffled a giggle at my expense.</p><p>"What is it?" Hanabi demanded of Moegi. "Why is the bracelet important?"</p><p>Moegi looked surprised. "They're friendship bracelets! Haven't you ever made one?"</p><p>Hanabi crossed her arms and frowned.</p><p><em> Oh.</em> Yeah, okay. She was, from the little I'd seen of her, blunt and forthright in a way that read as rude. Bossy. But that was only because she was a little girl. That attitude – what it really was – was <em> command. </em> And that made a whole lot of sense, didn't it? Hinata had been set aside because she was 'soft'. Of course they were trying to make Hanabi into a better heir. Or maybe it wasn't even that deliberate; Hanabi spoke like she was in command because <em> people listened to her.</em></p><p>Still. It would be a hard attitude to make friends with. Especially if her clan were strict about who was 'acceptable'.</p><p>"We can make some more later," Ino said, the two of us meeting eyes quickly, the same understanding passing between us. "I'm sure I still have my old supplies somewhere." She clapped. "But first, let's introduce you to everyone."</p><p>It went… well. Maybe it wasn't terribly exciting or anything, but they seemed enamored by the meeting. And everyone was kind enough to keep them involved in conversations, even when they were out of their depth, or share stories from our missions.</p><p>I had planned some activities, just in case, but it didn't look like I would need them. Though, maybe…</p><p>"If you're free tomorrow, we can meet up for some more training," I suggested, just before they went home.</p><p>They looked thrilled and not like I had just suggested more work on a Sunday.</p><p>"Moegi, can you invite Konohamaru and Udon?" I went on. I'd get Yakumo to pass along the invite to Ranmaru as well; hopefully this wasn't too short a notice. "We can make it a team verses team exercise."</p><p>"I will ask father," Hanabi said, which was the only small piece of dissent.</p><p>Because if there was one thing you could count on Konohamaru to be, it was loud. And he would be more than willing to tell <em> everyone</em> what had gone down. While I hoped that Iruka had given the girls their invites in a particularly public way, it worked better if someone was able to rub it in afterwards, and none of the three were really the type.</p><p>I should have felt bad that I was plotting such vindictiveness against an eight year old I didn't even know. I didn't.</p><p>"Alright!" I said to their cheerful faces the next day. "You all know how to do the replacement jutsu, right?" If Iruka-sensei kept with the same approximate lesson progress, they would have started learning it. It didn't matter if they had it down perfectly yet, because this would help.</p><p>The old Team Seven favourite. Replacement Tag. Or Replacement Tag Cops-and-Robbers since that was the easiest way to play two teams off against each other. It probably wouldn't have been too different from any of the other games of ninja that they would have played. Only with jutsu. Jutsu made everything cooler.</p><p>"This will be the prison," I said, gesturing at the stumps that Kakashi-sensei had threatened to tie us to. "If you get tagged by the police-ninja, you'll be taken to the jail. However, if one of your team sneaks in and tags you <em> back</em> , you're able to go free."</p><p>"Do people really use Replacement Jutsu?" Hanabi asked, almost doubtfully. "Grandfather says it's not worth learning to use."</p><p>"It absolutely worth learning to use," I said firmly. "I've used it in some very dire situations. And Naruto once saved an entire village with it."</p><p>"He saved me!" Moegi piped up. "When I got kidnapped."</p><p>Konohamaru clamored in with the rest of the story, the two of them talking over each other, while giving a triumphant look at Ranmaru. Apparently he'd taken offence to the fact that the other boy had been on an <em> actual mission</em> with Naruto.</p><p>"Exactly," I said, trying to get things slightly back on track. A little bit. "Is everyone clear on the rules?"</p><p>They were, so I sent them off. I played referee, making sure there was no step-violations going on and that rules were adhered to. And also occasionally catching people – Konohamaru – who overestimated how well they were likely to stand on tree branch post jutsu.</p><p>When they started looking tired, I called half time and stuffed them full of energy rich food and drink. It perked them back up enough for a round two, so I switched the team roles over.</p><p>And they weren't bad. Team Konohamaru clearly knew each other, and that gave them an advantage. But Team Hanabi – and she'd fallen into leadership easily, though could, perhaps, do with a few lessons on making sure her team was okay with that – wasn't bad either. They were pulling together.</p><p>And Hyuuga, Aburame and genjutsu user… give them an Inuzuka sensei and they'd have the same skill set as Team Eight.</p><p>Okay, that might have been getting a bit ambitious. I would be glad if they just got along.</p><p>"Okay, and that's the end!" I said. "I have to get to work soon. Seal of reconciliation, everyone!"</p><p>"But who won?" Konohamaru asked, even though he held up his hand as asked.</p><p>"Who do you think?" I asked back, since I hadn't exactly been counting points, and directed the question at the whole group. Which then turned into me leading them through a deconstruction of the game and who had done well and who could have improved at what things. I didn't <em> tell</em> them, I just helped them work it out themselves.</p><p>"Can we train again next weekend, Shikako-neechan?" Chiyako asked hopefully, staring up at me.</p><p>I hesitated. "I might be on a mission," I said diplomatically. "But there's no reason that you can't all get together to train. Just be sure to get someone to supervise if you want to do jutsu, right?"</p><p>I felt a little bad. But it wasn't <em> untrue</em> . I might have been going on a mission. I just didn't especially want to give up all my weekends. One, I could fritter away like this – but there were so many things I needed to do and get done.</p><p>Going to work was important, anyway, because I could pester Aoba into showing me how one went about 'suggesting' improvements to systems of the tower. He was slightly bemused by it, but accommodating as he had been all along.</p><p>There was paperwork for it, of course there was, so I took a copy.</p><p>Aoba looked like he was dying of curiosity. "Please tell me," he said.</p><p>I tried to look virtuous. "A good ninja should always be looking for improvements."</p><p>"But I need to know," he said, trailing after me. "It's my job to know things. I'm teaching you how to do this job, so you should tell me."</p><p>"Maybe after," I said, relenting a little. "It spoils the surprise if you know first."</p><p>Also, no one was going to be warned.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Nara R&amp;D green lit our seals.</p><p>I gave Shikamaru the process change paperwork to submit to his section head alongside a logistics plan he'd developed that would show just how significant a change it was, in terms of manpower savings.</p><p>It was a perfectly normal, if slightly ambitious thing to do. 'Hey, I see a better way to do the thing you do – here's how'.</p><p>Given the scope of the change we were proposing, I had expected that I would be called up to <em> somebodies</em> office to explain it. I hadn't expected that somebody to be Tsunade but maybe I should have. Well. It would do. It would more than do.</p><p>Dad was there and he gave me a weary look but… yeah, he was totally amused. There was Heihou, who must have been a department or division head of some form – I really had to find out the specifics of how departments <em> not</em> Intel were organized – and another, very agitated man who kept glaring at Shikamaru.</p><p><em> Bingo</em> .</p><p>I smiled cheerily and stood next to my brother's slouching form. He gave me a very droll look. Maybe he hadn't expected how much like dropping a bomb this would be. For shame.</p><p>This was <em> exactly</em> like dropping a bomb. I'd predicted it would basically upturn the entire Logistics division, if not more. This upset the foundation for basically every task they had – every roster, every plan, every forecast and prediction… anything that used the current seal was now obsolete. Useless. <em> Ruined.</em></p><p>They were staring down the barrel of an improvement but it was an improvement forced on them with no warning and no chance to prepare for it. They were going to be goddamn <em> swamped</em> with work for weeks, for months, just to be able to use it.</p><p>But the sheer value of it would mean they'd <em> have to.</em></p><p>"Evening, Hokage-sama!" I chirped, happily. "What can I do for you?"</p><p>"I should have expected you to be behind this," she lamented, looking at me with a sigh. "Go on, then. Explain yourself."</p><p>"I'm afraid I don't understand," I said, eyes going innocently wide. <em> Think fawn. Cute. Harmless.</em> "What seems to be the problem?"</p><p>She gave me a look like she knew I was playing a game. "Storage seals?"</p><p>I gave a hum of recognition. Like I hadn't known and her words had reminded me. "Oh, yes. Nara R&amp;D has finally approved them." I babbled into a rundown of the seals and capabilities, throwing the conversation to Shikamaru to draw him into it and explain the logistics side of it. He'd helped do most of the paperwork – he knew enough to babble along with me. To sell the seal. To make it sound impressive and to expound on all the things that it could do.</p><p>"-potentially it could be used to introduce a whole 'nother type of missions," I went on, after we'd covered all the bases and no one had stopped us yet. "It's a safe and secure method of transporting goods, so I imagine that many merchants would consider it. It has all the convenience and speed of a simple message delivery, while at the same time eliminating losses of goods due to damage during transport. It's possible Konoha could charge more for the service than it does for guarding caravans, despite it being markedly less work-"</p><p>And Tsunade still wasn't stopping me.</p><p>Shikamaru picked up the thread. "It could also be used for long term storage facilities," he pointed out, at a much slower pace than my own rapid fire. "We could stockpile greater quantities of goods in less space making certain outposts much less vulnerable to loss of supply chains."</p><p>"Alright," she said finally, lacing her fingers together and staring at us over them. "It sounds very impressive. If we do utilize these seals, what kind of manpower savings are we looking at for resupply?"</p><p>"Nearly two thirds," Shikamaru said, with a shrug. "And that's even if we return to sending ninja out in pairs, rather than solo as is current practice."</p><p>"Double it. Send them out as full teams," Tsunade ordered, though she lifted her eyes to direct that to Heihou rather than us. "If our ninja are carrying so many supplies I don't want them ambushed."</p><p>And that, right there, was probably the reason why Konoha didn't already have generic large contents seals already, despite the use they would have been during a war. Because it would have been easier to teach your stronger ninja how to create a storage seal, and then get them to carry the supplies around. That way, if the supply train was ambushed, as it probably would be … the enemy still had to deal with <em> Jiraiya.</em> For example.</p><p>"Logistics and Supply can put together a purchase order for however many units they'll need and I'll authorize it," she went on. "I'd like to see this in effect as soon as possible."</p><p>Agitated Guy spluttered, clearly unhappy. "Hokage-sama," he protested. "They're clearly pushing some kind of, of <em> clan agenda</em> . It's no coincidence that this change wasn't suggested until they benefited from it!"</p><p>As if anyone <em> cared</em> if it was a clan agenda. Clan agendas were how things got done. Because you had a whole group of people with power pushing for it to happen. People who had the skills and abilities and resources and connections to get things done.</p><p>"How could we suggest a system change if we didn't have a solution to the problem?" I asked, eyes wide and curious. "What could we have possibly said?"</p><p>Without a solution, it would just have been baseless complaining.</p><p>But he rallied with a valiant attempt. "Once the problem and solution had been identified, the seals could have been created by the Research and Development Department. That would have been the appropriate course of action, rather than contracting out to a clan." He seemed to realise he was on to something. "In fact, we can ask them to create a similar system, Hokage-sama. Then there's no need for us to engage in this… this spectacle of extortion!"</p><p>Triumph was a cold, glittering thing rising in my chest.</p><p>Dad had always described battle strategies in terms of Shogi. Shikamaru understood it like that, but it had never really fit for me. But this… yes, this was Shogi. This was being in control from the very start, having moved your pieces into place and set the board to your liking. This was every step prepared and known in advance and watching it unfold.</p><p>Even in his denial he had accepted our success; he just didn't realise it. He had switched to arguing <em> which</em> seals to use, not whether to use them at all. He had all but surrendered.</p><p>"You're welcome to ask R&amp;D to create a similar system for you," I agreed most sweetly, trying to channel Sakura as my inspiration. "Their waiting list is six months. For <em> consideration</em> of a project<em> .</em> "</p><p>Too long to wait when you had an alternative <em> right there.</em> Our seals were safety certified. They could be in production tomorrow. A much better option than a <em> maybe</em> six months down the line.</p><p>He couldn't let it go. Took the rope I had handed him and ran it out, long enough to tie a noose. "There are bound to be other storage specialists in the village!" he protested, desperately. "Who could be contracted for this."</p><p>He didn't even see the trap. Didn't realise he had been out maneuvered and defeated before he'd even known to rouse his troops for war. Had <em> no idea.</em></p><p>"There is Gai's girl; Tenten," Tsunade agreed, slowly. Her eyes were piercing. "She's shown certain aptitude with them. She has at least one unique creation."</p><p>"I'm sure she would be delighted to discuss it with you," I agreed smoothly. "If you look at the applications, she's the second author."</p><p><em> Snap. </em></p><p>She was <em> ours.</em> I'd moved her out of their reach before they'd even know to look for her. Denied them options and left them with only one path to take.</p><p>They'd have to take it. No one could do better, not so fast and so easily – and if I knew bureaucracy it was that people liked to sign off on the easiest option. Tsunade was already on board. It was happening.</p><p>"You can investigate alternatives," Tsunade said, and it was nothing but a concession, "but I'm giving the preliminary go ahead for the implementation of these seals into Logistics. I suspect there will be a lot of changes to be made to our current systems."</p><p>She raised an unimpressed eyebrow at me.</p><p>Oh yes. We'd taken the entire system and shaken it. It was exactly like dropping a bomb. The collateral damage was going to be magnificent.</p><p>I clasped my hands together and bowed. "I'm very pleased to present the NaraTen Storage Seals to you, Hokage-sama," I said. "Thank you."</p><p><em> Nara. </em> So everyone would know. So every time they used them, planned to use them, they would remember just how this came to be. I'd stamped our mark into it, so there was no denying.</p><p>Triumph was a cold, glittering thing indeed. My smile was sharp enough to cut.</p><p>Tsunade dismissed the two logistics ninja, but kept us there. She leant back in her chair. "You've done a great service to the village," she said formally. "I'm putting a commendation on both of your files."</p><p>"Three," Shikamaru said, sticking his hands in his pockets. "Tenten was also part of this. She deserves her share of the credit."</p><p>Tsunade accepted that. "Three of you, then," she corrected. "I have no doubt these seals will greatly benefit, not just Logistics and Supply, but other departments within Konoha." She paused. "That said, the next time you get the urge to overhaul an entire system… there are <em> many</em> more efficient ways to introduce it. Things are going to be <em> incredibly</em> chaotic now. "</p><p>No, it had done exactly what I wanted. That meant it was the most efficient way. The chaos was, as they said, a feature not a bug.</p><p>If she wanted to believe it was the result of recklessness and haste, and not exactly what I wanted, then that was her prerogative. Probably better for me, actually, but entirely false.</p><p>She dismissed us. Dad put a hand on each of our shoulders and directed us out of the room.</p><p>"Do you have something <em> particular</em> against the logistics department?" he asked dryly.</p><p>I shrugged. "Only the one that insulted Shikamaru," I said. "He shouldn't have done that."</p><p>I regretted <em> nothing.</em> I was the opposite of regretting things. I was incredibly satisfied.</p><p>Shikamaru let out a long controlled breath. "I can't believe we got dragged up to the Hokage," he complained.</p><p>I grinned at him. "Good thing you handed it in at the start of your shift not the end," I said. "She'd have been way grumpier if they'd had to drag her back in for it."</p><p>He shuddered.</p><p>I waved goodbye and headed back to the Cryptography office.</p><p>"Where'd you get dragged off to this time?" Aoba grumped at me. He hunched over the table, and covered his work with one arm so I couldn't see it. "You better have a good excuse."</p><p>"Hokage's office," I said, riding the high of success. I slung an arm around his shoulder, leaning into him. "Thanks for the help, Aoba-senpai."</p><p>"Wait, what?" he asked, confused. "What happened?"</p><p>Aoba gossiped like a chicken. Nothing I told him would stay secret. It was a known fact. But, oh, wasn't that the point? Everyone was going to know. And everyone was going to know <em> why</em> and who to blame.</p><p>I smiled, long and slow, secretive, confiding. "Want to know the whole story?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>I went back to working at the Aviary, which meant I got to avoid the long, slow implosion of basically <em> everything</em> at the tower. It turned out more than just logistics wanted the seals and were scrambling to re-organise to take advantage of them.</p><p><hr /></p><p>During the days, Shikamaru and I mostly focused on fulfilling our end of the Nara R&amp;D bargain – the chakra control and elemental affinity seals.</p><p>Surprisingly, Shikamaru didn't immediately ditch the seals to be my responsibility – he seemed willing to keep working on it, and was the one to go question them as to what we actually had to provide and the testing that had to be done.</p><p>R&amp;D were alternatively really thrilled at us for the huge boost in sales and annoyed at having to suddenly crank out so many immediately.</p><p>"I suggested they ask Tenten," Shikamaru told me, rolling his eyes. Which probably meant that their initial suggestion had probably been <em> us</em> . Nope, I had way better things to do than be a human photocopier. Shikamaru hadn't drawn any of them in the first place and was also entirely too lazy to want anything to do with that kind of workload.</p><p>"She might agree," I said, with a shrug. She also might not. She probably had better things to do than be a human photocopier, too.</p><p>He sat up and hooked his arms over his knees. "You know, she told me you'd invited her so that she could do the paperwork," he said.</p><p>"She didn't want to…" I tried to think about how to phrase it. "Want to be in our debt. And I couldn't exactly tell her that it was just because I needed her out of the way."</p><p>He snorted. "And people think you're so kind."</p><p>"I know," I said, a little sadly. "But it was fair recompense, right? And you made sure she got credited for it and everything."</p><p>Yeah, I should have done that. But it hadn't been my focus. Not really. The seals had been the means to the end.</p><p>"Fair for her," he said. "But you really ripped that guy to shreds. And somehow the whole village knows about it."</p><p>I shrugged. "No, that was fair," I disagreed. "That was <em> exactly</em> fair."</p><p>He looked unimpressed.</p><p>I looked unimpressed back. Anyone who insulted him deserved what they got, and he would have done the same. He <em> had</em> done the same, if not worse, if you counted threatening Sasuke.</p><p>Sometime after lunch, Tenten stopped by. That wasn't unusual since she'd been here for all our seal planning sessions, but since that was finished I hadn't expected to see her. She had a scroll in one hand, and looked terribly excited.</p><p>I stood to greet her.</p><p>And was summarily dragged off my feet. It felt a little bit like being hit by a small and slight brick wall, and then dragged around in a circle in excitement, proving that however she protested, Tenten was absolutely a member of Team Gai.</p><p>"Thank you, thank you, thank you," she chanted.</p><p>I clung to her shoulders. "Okay?" I squeaked. Her arms were like steel bands and I was not necessarily breathing correctly. My toes dragged over the grass, unable to really find purchase because she was lifting me too high.</p><p>"Tsunade-sama sent for me personally!" she said. "She said the seal was great!"</p><p>Tenten let me go. And then proceeded to tackle-hug Shikamaru in a similar manner. He looked like he had expected it <em> even less</em> .</p><p>I gave him a thumbs up over her shoulder.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Intelligence Division Arc: Chapter 106</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Little bit of mood whiplash there, but I was trying to make the chapter a bit longer.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 106</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Be careful of success; it has a dark side. ~ Robert Redford</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Okay," Aoba said, days later when I arrived for my shift. "I picked up a small mission for us."</p><p>He gave me a missions scroll and I opened it curiously.</p><p>"It's just an Intel pickup," he explained. "Someone has to go out and grab the packages left at dead drops and bring them back. It shouldn't be too hard."</p><p>"Okay," I agreed, going over the information in the scroll. The town it named wasn't far away, so it really did seem like a single day job. Or overnight, as the case might have been. Go, retrieve, return. Simple. "Do I need anything?"</p><p>He shrugged. "It'll be a C-Rank mission, basically. So take what you would normally take when leaving Konoha, but you won't need anything extra."</p><p>Most of my stuff was in scrolls, anyway, so it wasn't like it took up a lot of space. And Tenten had been teaching me her Hammerspace – or Infinite Pocket, as she called it – which I was slowly getting the hang of. We'd both taken to wearing the seals written on bracers, so that we could iron out the final problems before actually inscribing it on skin. I felt like I would need to make a few changes to it before it came as naturally to me as it should because I hadn't had that much to do with the design process.</p><p>"I'll meet you at the gates?" I offered.</p><p>It didn't take me long to dart home and get my mission pack and let mum know. I actually got to the gates before Aoba, which proved he was in no hurry at all. Izumo and Kotetsu were on gate duty, and it was unreasonable of me to be disappointed that Sasuke wasn't there. It had just been… a while…</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>"Forgot something?" Aoba asked, appearing and disrupting my chain of thought.</p><p>I jolted. "Oh, no, nothing like that." I shook my head. "Sorry. I'm ready to go."</p><p>We set off at an unhurried pace. It was 'nearby' but it would still be a few hours of travel to get there. It was nice, though, to be stretching my legs for something that was important but not as hugely time critical as our tracking mission had been.</p><p>It was just after sundown when we arrived, leaving the trees to approach the village more normally on foot. The place was still reasonably busy, being a good sized town with a nightlife, and no one really looked at us too hard.</p><p>"Hmm," Aoba said, just a touch uneasily, as we walked. His voice dropped low so I could barely hear it. "The signal isn't up. The apartment at the top left… see the window? The pot plant is supposed to be on the other side."</p><p>We'd covered signaling devices – innocuous marks or signs that would let us know that the informant had made a dead drop. If it wasn't done, then that suggested the drop hadn't been made. Not really a good start.</p><p>"I guess you'll get to see how we deal with non-routine work instead," Aoba murmured. "He's usually pretty punctual, I don't like it." He seemed to weigh up his options. "We'll wait until morning, in case he simply didn't get the chance to make it today. If it's not done by then, we'll investigate."</p><p>He didn't seem unduly worried, though. And there were probably all kinds of reasons why a person wouldn't make a drop if they were trying to maintain secrecy.</p><p>Still… "The curtains aren't closed," I said. "And the lights aren't on."</p><p>Which made it different to the apartments around it and suggested there was no one inside it.</p><p>"Yeah," Aoba agreed. "I saw that."</p><p>There were plenty of hotels around and we picked one not too far away, pretty much at random. Aoba brought us a room for the night and the motherly woman at the counter smiled at us.</p><p>"Do let me know if you need anything, dearies," she said. "It is nice to see men spending time with their daughters."</p><p>Aoba dropped the key. "<em> Daughter</em> ?" he squawked, looking quite horrified.</p><p>I laughed at his expression, but… "Sister," I improvised quickly. "Nii-chan is visiting his girlfriend, but mum told him I had to come too."</p><p>Her expression smoothed out again. "There I go, assuming things," she said, laughing with me. "Do forgive me."</p><p>Aoba coughed and resettled his sunglasses, trying to regain some dignity. "Yes, well," he said, uncomfortably. "No harm done."</p><p>I dragged him off by the arm, waving to her, but both of us exceptionally eager to get away. As soon as we were around the corner I dropped his arm.</p><p>"I'm only twenty nine," he muttered.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. "I'm thirteen," I said. "The math isn't impossible. You should probably be glad she assumed family relationships."</p><p>He looked twice as uncomfortable.</p><p>"Besides," I said. "My dad is awesome. You should be flattered."</p><p>He had no comeback for that. You could hardly argue against the Jounin Commander being awesome.</p><p>Sixteen hours later, we were twenty kilometers away staring at a bonfire as it burnt itself out. Aoba seemed rather perturbed by it, which… it was his bonfire. If he hadn't wanted it, then he shouldn't have started it.</p><p>"That," Aoba said, with great finality, "is <em> not</em> how we normally deal with these things."</p><p>"It worked?" I offered, because that was true. We had the information we'd come for. Mission success.</p><p>He nodded. "Yes. But just so you're aware: that's not standard operating procedure. It's just… not."</p><p>"Alright," I agreed, because it seemed important to him to acknowledge that. "Back to Konoha?"</p><p>"Back to Konoha," he agreed and shook his head. "No one is going to believe this."</p><p><hr /></p><p>We did a few more interesting Intel missions, before the Cryptography gossip network – by which I mostly meant Aoba – let me know that Kakashi-sensei had returned to the village from whatever mission he'd been on.</p><p>And was in hospital for chakra exhaustion. Of course.</p><p>I swung by after my shift – completely out of visiting hours – and found his room. The bed was empty and the window was wide open.</p><p>I located his mission pack under the visitors chair and slung it over my shoulder. Then I hopped out the window. It was a bit of a fall to the ground, but nothing too bad. I crouched low to absorb the shock of the fall.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei had clearly done the same, and then managed to make it an additional three steps before having to take a break. He was leaning against the stone wall that circled the hospital compound and gave me a baleful look.</p><p>"Welcome home, sensei," I said, quietly.</p><p>I probably should have made him go back inside and stay in the hospital. It would probably have been the responsible thing to do. But he obviously wasn't going to stay, or anything, so it would have been pointless.</p><p>"Need a hand?" I asked casually.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei looked like he really wanted to say 'no', but we both knew that it wasn't true. Eventually, he grudgingly dropped an arm over my shoulder and let me help prop him up.</p><p>"I've been doing missions with Aoba-senpai," I said, instead of asking him how his mission had gone. I kept up the low grade chatter as we walked, filling him in on things that the gossip network had told me that I thought he might enjoy.</p><p>At his apartment, he unlocked the door and disarmed a few traps before nudging the door open.</p><p>I helped drag him inside, dropped him down on the bed – with a shuriken print duvet, of all things – and set his mission pack down in easy reach next to it.</p><p>"Hungry?" I asked, turning to dig through the small kitchen. The fridge was basically empty, but the cupboards were full of canned and dried and vacuum sealed goods; clearly prepared for sudden long absences. I filled the kettle and put it on, because soup would clearly be the easiest thing.</p><p>"Ah," Sensei said vaguely, but didn't tell me to stop and get out. His fingers twitched, and he gave a mournful look to the book sitting on the bedside table, clearly debating how much energy it would take to pick it up.</p><p>I picked it up and gave it to him. It was worth it for the tired eye-smile it got me. I rolled my eyes at him in return.</p><p>I made soup, and then extra for breakfast and set the little rice cooker going. I doubted he would have much more energy then, and food helped.</p><p>Not having to do things like make food <em> also</em> helped.</p><p>I was just cleaning up and getting ready to go, when someone thumped on the door. "Brat," Tsunade called through the wood, voice loaded with irritation. "I don't do house calls."</p><p>I looked at sensei.</p><p>He wiggled deeper into the bed and dropped his book over his face, like that would hide him. It did not.</p><p>Right.</p><p>I opened the door. "Tsunade-sama."</p><p>She paused and looked at me, then gently shouldered past and into the apartment. "Getting your students to break you out, now?" she asked, still sounding irritated.</p><p>"I didn't need to be there," Kakashi-sensei said, voice slightly muffled on account of having his book over his face. "I'm fine."</p><p>She actually rolled her eyes. "If you walked here under your own power, I will give Naruto the hat right now," she dismissed. Her hands glowed briefly green, coming down to land on his forehead and chest. "You can't keep doing this. Repeated chakra exhaustion isn't <em> healthy.</em> "</p><p>"I'm dealing with it," he said back, voice suddenly flat and tight.</p><p>I tried to pretend I was part of the wallpaper because I was pretty sure I wasn't supposed to be hearing this. Even though it was <em> deliberately</em> being had in front of me.</p><p>"There are options," Tsunade said, in the tone of someone who had had this conversation before, and thought that the other person was being a complete idiot. "Reconsider the surgery."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei was silent for a long moment. "No," he said.</p><p>He couldn't see it but she smiled, just a brief uptick of her lips in victory. Like somehow that 'no' had been less firm than any other response in the past. And she was pleased about it.</p><p>I tried really, really hard not to wonder what surgery she was suggesting, or why Kakashi-sensei was against it. Really, really hard.</p><p>"I'm going to go," I said meekly, because the feeling of being an intruder – a game piece, even – was too strong. Too uncomfortable. "Good night, Kakashi-sensei."</p><p><hr /></p><p>After a few days, we picked up training again, though thankfully not at five am. Kakashi-sensei was clearly still tired and did more instructing that training, but it was just as useful for me.</p><p>Given that it had taken him a week to recover from chakra exhaustion in the Land of Waves, I wasn't going to push.</p><p>I went through my warm up stretches in the training grounds, waiting for him to show up. I'd been making progress with the muscle rejuvenation medical jutsu, and I thought I was noticing differences. Nothing so dramatic as Sakura's sudden muscle growth, but I wasn't trying to build a lot so that was fine.</p><p>"Boo," a voice said softly, directly into my ear. A hand clapped down on my shoulder.</p><p>I shrieked, whirling round, elbow coming up directly for the voice – the fastest, shortest attack I could manage from that position.</p><p>His black eyes whirled red. <em> Sharingan!</em></p><p>And all the colour drained out of my world.</p><p>My elbow swung through empty space. My hand uncurled, chakra blossoming to my fingertips, a Touch Blast forming with a thought. It extended, swiping out towards him.</p><p>He dodged back, back, back, chakra flaring high in preparation for an attack.</p><p><em> No!</em></p><p>I pushed chakra into my Gelel stone, pulled it back out. My flesh dissolved into shadow. I blurred forward, racing towards him, a deep formless shadow. If I could just smother him –</p><p>He breathed fire, straight at me.</p><p>It forced me back, to disperse and go around, reform and try attack again. But he pulled the fire back, making it creep over his arms, holding it close to provide light against me.</p><p>And then Kakashi-sensei appeared in the clearing, suddenly, in a rattle of chakra smoke. "<em> What</em> is going on here?"</p><p>I reformed next to him, crouched defensively. He wasn't at full strength. But there were two of us now, one could –</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei!" we both said.</p><p>We. Both. Said.</p><p>I looked. And my world felt like it tilted sideways.</p><p>It was Sasuke. I'd just- I'd just tried to kill –</p><p>My jutsu released, dropping me to my flesh and blood knees on the grass.</p><p>"I don't know!" Sasuke said, voice rising. "She just! I."</p><p>I swallowed, throat dry. "You snuck up on me," I said. And it was the weakest of defenses. "You startled me."</p><p>And I'd tried to kill him. I'd attacked with full intent to kill. I could still feel the tingle of the missed Touch Blast on my fingers. If he hadn't had the Sharingan, he might not have dodged it.</p><p>That wasn't-</p><p>That wasn't-</p><p>My hands were shaking. I pressed them flat against my legs.</p><p>Sasuke let his fire go out. His arms were red but unburnt. He came closer, but cautiously. "I didn't think you'd try and kill me for it," he grumbled.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei took a deep breath and let it out slowly. I listened to it, trying to ground myself on my senses. The sounds of their breathing. The wind. The birds in the trees. The warmth of the noon sunlight.</p><p>"That's a lesson then, Sasuke," Sensei said. "It's not a good idea to sneak up on a ninja, no matter how well you know them."</p><p>I closed my eyes. "I should have sensed him coming," I said. I <em> should</em> have. I just hadn't been paying attention. What was the point of training my skills up, if I didn't use them? Didn't pay attention?</p><p>"I've been practicing my suppression," Sasuke objected. He crossed his arms. "That's why I tried…"</p><p>"I should have," I repeated. Because the alternative was what had just almost happened. The alternative was attacking people I cared about, just because I was off in my own head.</p><p>"You've both got things to work on," Kakashi-sensei said firmly. "But the important thing is, no one got hurt!" He gave an eye smile and dropped a hand down to ruffle my hair.</p><p>I didn't flinch.</p><p>"Sorry," I said, barely looking up at Sasuke. It was inadequate.</p><p>"Yeah," he agreed. "Me too. I didn't… I didn't think." He shrugged, awkwardly, then sat cross-legged across from me. "How long have you been able to do that shadow thing?"</p><p>"A while," I said softly.</p><p>He snorted. "Before the Exams? And you <em> didn't</em> use it against Gaara?"</p><p>I managed a ghost of a smile. "I wanted to keep a few cards up my sleeve for the future." I tried to go on, say something. Anything. "That fire thing. It's new?"</p><p>He lifted a shoulder in a shrug. "Fire style chidori variant," he said. "It's easier to hold than lightning, and it burns rather than penetrates so it doesn't have to be used in a straight line."</p><p>"Usually," Kakashi-sensei said, settling himself down on the ground too. "The aim is to set the <em> other</em> person on fire."</p><p>"Oh, it'll do that too," Sasuke said. "It'll probably set <em> everything</em> on fire. Except sand. It didn't work so great against Gaara. Maybe if I'd managed to make it hotter…"</p><p>"Right," I said. "I missed that fight."</p><p>Clearly I had missed more than I had thought. I rubbed a hand over my eyes. It had stopped shaking. That was something.</p><p>We were silent for a bit, but the tension was draining away. My heart had stopped racing.</p><p>"I guess it's a bad time to ask for a favour," Sasuke said.</p><p>I managed a laugh. "I think you can ask whatever you want," I said. There was no way I could say 'no' right now.</p><p>"I need something picked up from one of the outer Uchiha strongholds," he said. "And I can't go get it myself."</p><p>Obviously, since he couldn't leave the village.</p><p>"Sure," I agreed. "Just give me a list or whatever. I'll get a pass to leave and pick it up."</p><p>There would probably be a slight fee, because it technically would fall under the 'mission' category, but I'd waive payment and it would just end up being the village charges. Or something like that.</p><p>"It's just a scroll," Sasuke said. "A summoning contract. I <em> think</em> I know where it is. But there might be… traps or something."</p><p>"We'll both go," Kakashi-sensei said, mildly. He had his book out, but clearly wasn't ignoring us. "If they're Sharingan deactivated, I can deal with that."</p><p>I nodded. "Yeah, I'll get a chakra sample from you, maybe. That might work, too." The storage stones didn't hold much chakra for that long, but it should be enough to fool a few traps into thinking Uchiha were about.</p><p>"Thanks," he said. He looked upwards and sighed. "I have to get going, they didn't give me much time, and that only because I said there were people that would notice if I went totally dark."</p><p>"You bet we would," I said, frowning over the 'they'.</p><p>Sasuke gave me a look of exaggerated surprise. "You? Oh, I meant the Hokage. She would probably assume I'd been kidnapped or something."</p><p>I made a face at him. "Get out of here."</p><p>He smirked and vanished in a body flicker.</p><p>I rubbed a hand over my face again. "Shit," I said, very quietly. "I can't do that again."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei regarded me very seriously. "No," he agreed. "You can't. Someone will get hurt."</p><p>I curled forward, bringing my knees up to my chest. "What do I do?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei's response was both surprising and not. "Train," he said. "Don't worry, I have just the thing."</p><p>"Ominous," I said dryly. But I would gladly take any help.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I didn't know what Kakashi-sensei had planned until later that night when I was in the Intel Division and turned a corner and walked straight into him.</p><p>"Tsk, tsk," he said, after I bounced off his flak jacket. "And I wasn't even sneaking that time."</p><p>He pulled out a black vivid, uncapped it and with lightning swiftness drew a single line down my left cheek beneath my eye.</p><p>"One point to me," he said, eye curving into a ridiculous smile, and vanished.</p><p>I stared after him in bafflement, and then down at the documents in my arms. Right. Obviously the best training for 'not being snuck up upon' was… to be snuck up upon.</p><p>He got me three more times before my shift was even half way through, by which point I was trying <em> really hard</em> to spot him coming.</p><p>There was a brief flutter of chakra. I spun, and caught his wrist just as he reached for me.</p><p>"Good job!" Kakashi-sensei beamed. He drew a line down my other cheek. "Now I can stop holding back."</p><p>All the ninja in the room were looking at me. I scowled, just <em> daring</em> them to comment on the ridiculous marks on my face that shouted out the score. Sure it was ridiculous, as far as training went, but I'd like to see <em> them</em> try and spot Kakashi-sensei coming.</p><p>The tally grew – more on the left than the right. Sometimes I didn't even notice them being made until I caught sight of them in a window reflection, or checked.</p><p>I scrubbed them off at night, which wasn't easy. Vivid didn't like to come off skin.</p><p>"You've got something on your face," Mum said in the morning, trying to scrub it off with her finger. "Did you fall asleep on your ink brush again?"</p><p>I blinked at her and went to the bathroom mirror. There was a single black mark running down my cheek.</p><p><em> Maybe I didn't wash them all off last night?</em> I wondered, but immediately knew it wasn't true.</p><p>I'd come home. I'd thought it was over. I'd thought it was <em> safe</em> .</p><p>But what was home, really? It was walls. A roof. Windows and doors. The same as any other building. There were no special properties that made it invulnerable.</p><p>If I had to keep my guard up, then I had to keep it up here, too.</p><p>Lesson learnt, sensei.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Intelligence Division Arc: Chapter 107</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: So apparently vivid isn't a term you all use? Strange. Anyway, they're an indelible marker, if it wasn't clear from context.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 107</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Every parting gives a foretaste of death, every reunion a hint of the resurrection. ~ Arthur Schopenhauer</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>It was easy enough to organize us passes out of the village from the Intel Division. Aoba even helped me with how, though it was clear he was basically dying of curiosity.</p><p>"Just to pick up a thing," I demurred, to his questions of what, exactly, we were doing. It didn't <em> necessarily</em> have to be secret, but it also wasn't really a thing I wanted to spread around. Not so much because of us going, but for what it would mean for Sasuke.</p><p>It would be giving up his tactics – summoning – and also the fact that the Uchiha hideouts still had valuable things in them and relatively few ways of protecting it. I didn't want to kick off some kind of treasure hunt if that got out.</p><p>"Vague," Aoba complained, adjusting his glasses. "Vague is good, though. We like vague here."</p><p>In the end, my paperwork looked very… shady. Over the top lacking in details. Client? Known. Location? Verbal directions. Objective? As per verbal agreement.</p><p>"Will this pass?" I asked, doubtfully. "Will someone really sign off on it?"</p><p>"You might need to explain the details in person," Aoba explained. "Who's the second pass for?"</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei," I said absently.</p><p>He opened his mouth. He closed his mouth. Tried again. "Does he know that?"</p><p>I blinked at him. "Well, yeah. He volunteered to come."</p><p>Aoba looked like Kakashi and 'volunteer' shouldn't have been in the same sentence. "Right," he said. "You know. A 'simple' pickup mission doesn't normally require an elite Jounin. Right?"</p><p>I kept a straight face. "I might need his Sharingan," I said. It was true. It was just that winding up Aoba was too much fun.</p><p>Aoba looked even more pained. "Are you sure this counts as 'a simple pick up mission'?" He pleaded. "Really sure? Because people are going to look at this and be suspicious. Unless you want them to be suspicious about it because it is simple and it will then mask something not-simple later on?"</p><p>That was getting into too many layers. Underneath the underneath. But it was probably not a bad idea, either. I had no idea what I would need that cover <em> for</em> but if I was looking into S-rank ninja in future, I could easily see situations where elite backup would come in handy.</p><p>"I just haven't done a mission with my sensei in a while," I claimed. "Is that so wrong?"</p><p>He didn't look like he bought it, but grumbled, "It's a decent excuse, anyway. I assume the Hokage knows about all this?"</p><p>I paused. "Not yet? Do you think she should be the one to sign off on it?" It was probably not that important, but it would be easier to explain to her than to anyone else. And I could say it was because she wanted to be kept up to date on Sasuke things. I nodded. "Yes, okay. I'll do that."</p><p>I couldn't get it done immediately, but in the end Tsunade signed off on it with only minimal grumbling about people who took the secrecy thing too far, and a handful of scribbled numerical codes that I couldn't interpret.</p><p>I took it down to the mission room to get the passes issued and the mission filed – with my bribery coffee pot – and was trying to corner one of the desk ninja to help me.</p><p>"Ah, excuse me?"</p><p>Someone tapped me on the shoulder.</p><p>The thing was – I <em> was sensing.</em> And everything told me that there was no one there.</p><p>I dropped the coffee pot and spun around, pivoting on my heel. My hand came up to grab the wrist on my shoulder.</p><p>He yanked it back, rapidly, before my fingers could even touch skin.</p><p>And it … was not Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>The voice hadn't been Kakashi-sensei's voice. But still, somehow I'd expected…</p><p>There was a pause. We stared at each other warily.</p><p>I reached back and grabbed the coffee pot before it hit the floor.</p><p>"Can I help you?" I asked, taking him in. Dark messy hair. Forehead protector and happuri-style face guard that the Second Hokage had popularized. And chakra that was – if I focused to my <em> utter best</em> – simmering very low and concealed.</p><p>More than one person was watching him warily – had startled when I'd startled. It implied no one had seen him move up behind me. He'd <em> snuck up on me</em> in a room full of ninja and no one had seen.</p><p>And that wasn't <em> polite</em> to do in a ninja environment. It was like walking around with your weapons out. We all knew that the weapons were there, but there was an extra layer of 'threat' when they were bared.</p><p>He looked incredibly uncomfortable. "I'm sorry," he said. "It's just that Kakashi-senpai wanted me to give this to you?" The end of the sentence rose into a question, like he wasn't quite sure about it himself.</p><p>He held out a hand, a black pen lying in the middle of it. The same pen as the marks that still adorned my face.</p><p><em> Pay attention,</em> it meant. <em> You're supposed to be aware of threats. Not just aware of me.</em></p><p>I closed my eyes for a second, then forced myself to smile at him. "Thank you. Sorry to get you dragged into this."</p><p>I took the pen and tucked it into my vest pocket, with the feeling that it would probably end up in sensei's hands again before too long. Clearly this training had a lot further to go.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. "Ah, well, senpai is senpai," he said, a touch of resignation in his voice. More than a touch.</p><p>I was beginning to suspect that I knew who this was. Sort of.</p><p>Well, at least he hadn't recruited <em> Gai-sensei</em> for it. I liked the man, but that had potential to be incredibly horrifying. There would have been heart attacks involved, and they would probably have been mine.</p><p>Yamato – or, that had been a code name, hadn't it? What was his name? – gave a vague shrug and started to sidle away.</p><p>"Coffee?" I suggested suddenly, awkwardly holding out the bribery-pot with a sheepish smile. "For your trouble."</p><p>There was no particular reason for it, beyond my own curiosity. I was pretty sure the answer to most of the obvious questions like 'how do you know Kakashi-sensei' was 'Anbu', but still. We were bound to cross paths again in the future – I might as well start now.</p><p>"Ah," he said awkwardly, but stopped trying to leave. "Okay?"</p><p>He didn't have a cup, unlike basically <em> all</em> the office nin, but I was prepared. I twisted my wrist, focusing and pulling out the stack of paper cups I had tucked into hammerspace. That wasn't particularly polite in ninja environments either, but if you didn't feel the sealing activate, it did just look like sleight of hand.</p><p>And it was practice. Practice, practice, practice.</p><p>I pulled off one, whirled the stack of cups back into hammerspace, and filled it for him. "There you go, uh…" I trailed off.</p><p>"Tenzo," he supplied.</p><p>Score one for me.</p><p>"Tenzo," I repeated, with a bright smile. "Just give me a second to get someone to sign this, and I'll be right with you."</p><p>I turned that smile on the ninja behind me. Stunningly, someone actually scrambled to take my mission, this time. I filled their cup up as thanks, but really, apparently the way to get things done was to make a huge scene. It figured.</p><p>"So how did Kakashi-sensei sucker you into this?" I asked.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We arranged to leave at nine, so I arrived at the gates with a notebook and took a seat, striking up off and on conversation with Izumo.</p><p>At ten past ten, Kakashi-sensei arrived. He didn't try to sneak, because I was paying absolute attention and expecting him, just sauntered up nonchalantly.</p><p>"Morning," I greeted, tucking my book away. I stood and dusted myself off.</p><p>He sighed. "You take all the fun out of it, you know." It was almost pouting.</p><p>"Good," I said. It didn't stop him from being late, but Kakashi being late was just a fact of life now. But there was nothing pressing being held up, our mission was not time critical and it was a nice day. There were worse things to contend with.</p><p>We didn't travel fast but it seemed that in order to make up for the pace Kakashi-sensei was keen to make me practice my stealth and evasion techniques.</p><p>"Your scent masking needs more…" he made a vague wiggle with his hand. "More," he decided on.</p><p>"Yes, sensei," I said instead of protesting that I was trying. Scent masking was hard because <em> scent</em> was basically the collection of microscopic particles that fell off of the human body as it moved and good luck trying to stop that. Obviously that was the goal, but it wasn't easy. There were higher level techniques that could erase a scent trail after it had been laid, but that was… several magnitudes more difficult.</p><p>"It doesn't really work if you don't keep it active," he pointed out.</p><p>Which meant it was another thing I had to focus on. Constantly. <em> Multitasking, yay.</em></p><p>So it was almost a relief when we managed to arrive at the Uchiha outpost. Sasuke's directions had been fairly vague, because he'd likely never been here himself and had been operating from whatever records remained in his grasp.</p><p>Still, it was basically a large concrete fort. Hard to completely miss. It was slightly more dilapidated than five years of abandonment should really have caused, but I had no idea of how frequently it had been maintained after the migration to Konoha. Maybe it had been slowly falling to pieces for fifty years.</p><p>It was… eerie in a way. It felt like a ghost town, full of the knowledge that this had once been a home, full of people, and now it wasn't. Now those people weren't. It was fuller than I had expected it to be, rooms and storage spaces packed full, like they had expected to come back at any moment.</p><p>It wasn't all old stuff, either. And that, maybe, made it sadder? Had they resupplied the outposts, before the massacre? Had that been a contingency plan – to retreat here, to the other outposts, if things in Konoha didn't improve?</p><p>Had that been something that caused the warning signs to rise? That tipped Danzo off in the first place?</p><p>That just… made it sadder.</p><p>I kept my chakra sense tuned to their maximum, both to look for traps and also because there were two remaining Uchiha that I <em> really</em> didn't want to run into here.</p><p>Chances were low. But. I <em> really</em> didn't want to.</p><p>We started combing the place, looking out carefully for traps and trying to locate the summoning scroll that Sasuke wanted.</p><p>"Do you think we should bring any of the rest of it back?" I asked, uncertainly. There were general resupply items that wouldn't matter – clothes and weapons and long life food – but there was still a library's worth of information here and some of it was bound to be important. It didn't feel right to leave it behind, forgotten.</p><p>"You could," Kakashi-sensei said, without indicating in either direction which option he preferred. He riffled through a stack of scrolls, checking to see if any of them were the one we were looking for.</p><p>I considered it. "I think I will," I said. Sasuke might have wanted it. Eventually. And if it was in a storage scroll, it would be safer than leaving it here.</p><p>I went back to searching. Eventually, Kakashi-sensei found a concealed door with his Sharingan, and that was where we found what we were looking for.</p><p>"The important stuff, huh?" I asked absently, unrolling the scroll to check that it was what we wanted.</p><p>"Looks like it," Kakashi-sensei agreed, poking around. There was more stuff in here – things that the Uchiha had deemed worth the extra security. We spent some time sealing most of it away for Sasuke, leaving out only things with seals on them.</p><p>You didn't put seals inside storage scrolls. It just… didn't work out very well. They destabilized. Something about being cut off from the chakra and natural energy that made them function.</p><p>We tidied up – or I did – and reset as many of the traps as we could to protect the place. It would be bad form to leave it unguarded.</p><p>Then we headed back to Konoha.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"So how'd it go?" Kotetsu asked, taking my passes and signing us back into the village. Kakashi-sensei accepted his back, lifted a hand in a laconic goodbye wave and left.</p><p>I shrugged. "Fine."</p><p>"That's it? Fine?" Kotetsu asked, sharing an amused look with the other Chunin on duty. "I'm sure it was more interesting than that."</p><p>I gave him a bemused look. "It was only a simple pick up mission. What could be interesting about it?"</p><p>He laughed. "Fine, be that way. I'll hear about it eventually you know."</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about." I shook my head. "Nothing happened." It wasn't <em> that</em> surprising, was it? Sometimes missions could go right.</p><p>I waved them off and headed towards Sasuke's apartment to give him the scroll and actually 'complete' the mission. Technically, until that was done, I was still on the clock. Not that there was really a clock. Because we weren't getting paid. But it was the principle of the thing.</p><p>I knocked on the door. Sasuke's chakra stirred, hovered and… stayed where it was.</p><p>I knocked again.</p><p>"What?" Sasuke snapped, irritably, wrenching the door open so fast that my hand was still in the air mid-knock.</p><p>I paused.</p><p>He looked ruffled and tired and was wearing a plain set of Konoha blues that just <em> might</em> have doubled as pajamas. Maybe he'd been ignoring me because he'd been sleeping. I felt a little bad about it.</p><p>But that feeling was squished under a sudden surge of worry that transmuted into a flash of helpless anger.</p><p>My fist tightened, knuckles going white. Then I brought it down and punched him <em> hard</em> in the bicep. Right over the goddamn <em> seal</em> I could sense there.</p><p>Sasuke yelped in pain.</p><p>"I can't <em> believe you,</em> " I hissed, stepping inside the apartment. He gave ground, stepping back and letting me, eyes wide and bewildered. His hand came up to hover over the spot I'd hit.</p><p>"Shikako, what-"</p><p>I kicked the door shut behind me. It slammed, with a sense of angry finality. "<em> Anbu?</em> " I hissed, voice low. I knew better than to shout. Especially about this. "You joined Anbu?"</p><p>His confusion shifted to exasperation. Like that explained it, like he understood but found it irrelevant. "You're not supposed to know about that," he protested halfheartedly. "How did you even find out?"</p><p>My jaw was clenched so hard I could hear my teeth grinding together. "You think I can't tell when someone's put a seal on you?"</p><p>And of course the Anbu tattoo was a seal. What else would it be, if you were going to all the effort of marking your covert corps with it?</p><p>(<em> What did they do, though? Because if it was something that would harm him, in anyway, I was going to-)</em></p><p>"That… would probably do it," Sasuke acknowledged, a tad sheepishly. He rubbed the seal, like it was hurting. Good. I hoped I'd hit it hard enough. "But look, it's not that bad. I know what the rumours about it are like but they're only rumours. It's not really anything more than we were doing before – only secret."</p><p>"I don't give a damn what you're doing," I said, because he was missing the point. "Naruto <em> told you</em> -"</p><p>Naruto had to have told him.</p><p>He had to know how dangerous it was.</p><p>"About Sai?" Sasuke asked, putting the pieces together, like he should have all along. "And the seal?" But then he rolled his eyes. "No one has approached me and tried to stick things in my mouth."</p><p>I wanted to shake him so hard his brain rattled in his skull. He was being purposefully idiotic. "It's not that straightforward!"</p><p>"I know!" he said back, voice rising, and I wasn't the only one annoyed now. "But it has to be Anbu! It's not like I can leave the village as <em> me.</em> "</p><p>And that was the crux of it, wasn't it?</p><p>That was why Sasuke had taken it. Because it was the only real path left to him.</p><p>I closed my eyes, took a deep breath and let it out slowly. The anger drained out of me. "It's not safe," I said. "They could be anyone but they're definitely involved in Anbu. And you know you're a target."</p><p>I knew it wasn't going to stop him. <em> You'd make the same choices as me,</em> I'd told him. 'Safe' was never going to be a convincing argument.</p><p>"It's not so bad," Sasuke said, eyes watching me warily, but hostility draining out of him too. "The Hokage is the only one who knows who I am. I get my orders straight from her. And she'll notice if I go missing or, you know, can't talk about where I've been."</p><p>Secrets like that were hard to keep. But if there was anywhere it would work, it would be Anbu.</p><p>"Just… be careful," I said. It was all I could say.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. "Yeah, yeah. Did you get the scroll, anyway?"</p><p>I handed it over, as well as all the extra stuff I'd packed up for him and told him why. "I figured you'd want it," I said.</p><p>He didn't seem to really know what to do with it, but also didn't say I shouldn't have<em> .</em> So. Success, I guessed.</p><p>"Thanks," he said. "You didn't… run into trouble?"</p><p>I shook my head. "Not even bandits," I assured him. "The most exciting thing that happened was Kakashi-sensei reading Sharingan coded graffiti off of the walls. Though I'm pretty sure he skipped all the dirty ones."</p><p>It was a weak attempt to lighten the atmosphere. But Sasuke granted it a smirk and a soft huff of amusement so that was something.</p><p>I left his apartment and ruefully reflected I really shouldn't have been as surprised as I was. All the clues had been there. Mysterious training. Not being around. It didn't necessarily mean Anbu but in hindsight, there had been signs.</p><p><em> Kakashi-sensei knows</em> . I was absolutely certain of it. He'd been the one to make Sasuke's vague excuses to me, and he hadn't been worried at all. I hoped that that meant it was okay.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I clicked the shogi piece down, completing my formation but only postponing my inevitable defeat by another three or four moves.</p><p>Dad surveyed the board. Moved a piece.</p><p><em> Yep. Inevitable.</em> But I kept going, because sometimes you just had to meet the inevitable.</p><p>"Something bothering you?" he asked, offhand and casual.</p><p>I hummed, not really in agreement. "I'd like to request permission to sign one of our summoning scrolls," I said.</p><p>I probably should have made a more formal request, but I'd do it if he told me to. I was pretty sure it would be okay, though. Summoning wasn't a thing that our clan focused on, all that much. And I was a Special Jounin, which was well above the Chunin requirement for making the request.</p><p>"Which one?" Dad asked, voice idle.</p><p>"The deer," I answered. We had a couple, but the smaller contracts were conversely in much higher demand. There were the blackbirds and the bats which were both useful as small, flying messengers rather than battle summons.</p><p>And while those were all well and good, they weren't what I needed.</p><p>More tempting was the idea of taking the risk to reverse summon myself to find whatever animal type fit me<em> .</em> It was the idea of <em> knowing</em> what it would be that was the lure – like finding out your animagi form or patronus – more than the potential of the animal itself. I didn't know what it would be or how useful it was. Or how happy they would be to have a human wandering around their lands.</p><p>And that was the risk.</p><p>"The current summoner is Sembei-obaasan," he said. "You'll have to get her permission for it. But I see no reason to say no."</p><p>I nodded my thanks. I already knew that, but it was permission.</p><p>The next morning – though, not too early – I went around to the house where she lived. Sembei-baasan was, to put it impolitely, really old. Older than Konoha, old. She spent most of her days in a rocking chair on the deck at the front of her house, watching the world go by. She still lived in the clan grounds, because Konoha didn't really have <em> rest </em> homes, and the rest of us often went around to help her with things. Or, for the younger generation, because she was there and would listen and generally had sweets to give out.</p><p>"Bout time," she said with a dry cackle, when I got around to telling her why I was there. "I wondered if I'd be dust before that boy sent someone around to sign it."</p><p>She picked up her cane and rose stiffly to her feet.</p><p>There were still signs in her that she was a ninja, even now. Even though she was unsteady on her feet, even though she moved at about the pace of a tortoise, there was no sound of footsteps or creaking of floorboards.</p><p>I shadowed her into the house, trying not to hover too closely.</p><p>In the living room, there was a bookcase. She went to it, and plucked a scroll from an ornate holder – the kind that was more often used to display swords.</p><p>"The deer keep their scroll of summoners to themselves so that not just anyone can sign it," she explained. "But when I started getting too old to call on them myself, we made this. It's a single use summoning. If they like you, they'll let you sign it. If they don't…" She shrugged.</p><p>If they don't, you don't.</p><p>We went back outside, because summoning a deer inside a house was just a bad plan all around.</p><p>Sembei-baasan resituated herself in her rocking chair, while I moved away from the house to open space. I opened the scroll, reading the summoning sigils with interest – they were so different! – before biting my thumb with a chakra-sharp incisor and spreading blood along the center of it.</p><p>"Summoning Jutsu!" I called, forcing chakra into it and pressing it down onto the ground.</p><p>I felt the jutsu activate – a call that went through the world, not out or up or away but <em> through</em> , reaching to some other place. And then it doubled back, chakra rushing towards me like a train down the tracks.</p><p>I tried not to flinch back.</p><p>Chakra smoke exploded beneath my hands, obscuring the moment seal for a moment, and a deer unfolded out of it, rising taller and taller to reveal a huge towering beast, the largest I'd ever seen. I wasn't even as tall as his legs.</p><p>He tossed his head, his spiked, metal tipped antlers dragging the white chakra smoke after them in twisting trails. He was clad in what looked like Samurai armour, plates along his neck and back, and a twisted oni mask overtop his head.</p><p>"Who calls?!" He bellowed. The air shivered.</p><p>Up on the deck, Sembei-baasan cackled. "Look at you, all dressed up for war. You old showoff," she said.</p><p>His head swung around to look at her. "Sembei," he said, though much less loudly. "You look as old and frail as a mummified corpse."</p><p>Sembei-baasan tapped her cane on the deck, looking more animated than I'd ever seen her. "Come up here and say that, I dare you," she challenged.</p><p>He stepped closer, a single stride taking him over to her. I hovered, indecisive – a fight would not go well. But he only lowered his gigantic head until it was resting against her chest. She wrapped her arms around it, working fingers under the mask to scratch with her nails.</p><p>"I had not thought to see you again," he rumbled. "This is a glad meeting."</p><p>She cackled again. "The kids took some time to get their acts into gear," she admitted. "But what do you expect from Nara? Now stop acting like I'm back from the dead and go and greet your summoner."</p><p>She shoved him away. I doubted the force of her arms was enough to move him, really, but he accepted the moment, head rising and turning towards me.</p><p>I swallowed. "Uh. Hi."</p><p>I consciously didn't bow, even though I wanted to. This was a bad time for cross cultural miscommunication – deer only lowered their heads like that when they were about to charge. I didn't expect I would survive a head-to-head contact with this one.</p><p>"Greetings," he said. "I am Heijomaru, of the Sika tribe of the Deer. Do you wish to be our summoner, daughter of the forest?"</p><p>I nodded. "I do," I said. "I would very much like to work with you."</p><p>He considered me. "You are of Sembei's tribe. I have no objections to this." He tossed his head again, and stamped one forefoot down on the ground so hard I felt it shake. But I also felt the call, the summoning, and wasn't surprised when a scroll rose out of the ground as he raised his hoof back up again.</p><p>He nudged it over with his nose, so that it fell and unrolled. I could see the names of the past summoners, could see Sembei's done in a young and steady hand. There was a blank space for mine.</p><p>I paused. "Um. What are your terms?"</p><p>"Your chakra from the call is all we require," he said, dignified. "It allows us to maintain and strengthen our lands in the summon realm."</p><p>It was a topic that I wanted to know much more about. Because we gained so much from summons, that it stood to reason whatever they gained from us was worth just as much. The contract couldn't be so unequal.</p><p>But now wasn't the time.</p><p>Sembei cackled again. "Don't let him fool you," she called. "He has a soft spot for salt licks. You'll go through hundreds."</p><p>Heijomaru harrumphed and stamped a back foot. It was a natural movement of annoyance. "Silence your tongue, human," he hollered at her. Then he turned back to me. "Such things would be appreciated but they are not required. Though I would… request that you summon us near Sembei as frequently as possible for as long as it remains an option."</p><p>"Of course," I said, touched by it. The bond between them was clear even – or maybe especially – with how they chose to present it. "I will do my very best."</p><p>I wrote my name in blood and pressed my handprint onto the scroll.</p><p>"Welcome, summoner," Heijomaru said and lowered his giant head to press lightly against mine.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Intelligence Division Arc: Chapter 108</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: This delay comes thanks to the confusion of watching an episode (The Man Who Died Twice) and going 'but how does that <em> even work</em> '. So have way more sealing digression than anyone asked for.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 108</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> All difficult things have their origin in that which is easy, and great things in that which is small. ~ Lao Tzu </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Okay, but hear me out," Genma was saying to Aoba as I came into the room. His senbon looped up and down as he spoke. "She's a Special Jounin, right? Just like the rest of us."</p><p>He looked expectant.</p><p>"Yes," Aoba said reluctantly, as if conceding a point by admitting that it was true. "But running patrol doesn't fall under Intel responsibilities."</p><p>"It could," Genma argued. "You have to be familiar with the village, right? And all the other departments. It'll be good experience." He looked very pleased with himself.</p><p>I was instantly really wary about whatever they were talking about. It wasn't paranoid to say 'me' because that was exactly what it sounded like but me for <em> what</em> ?</p><p>"Well," Aoba hesitated.</p><p>Hesitation was weakness and weakness got exploited.</p><p>Genma turned, saw me, and smiled. "Hey, kid. Just who I was looking for. The patrol routes are short a couple of people tonight; can you help out?"</p><p>And even though I was slightly suspicious about the whole thing, my initial reaction was 'yes, of course', as it always was. The only thing that stopped me from agreeing, was because my time was already allocated here. I had a job to do.</p><p>"Aoba-senpai?" I asked. There was probably a reason Genma had asked him first.</p><p>"Ah, well. I suppose you can, if you don't have anything urgent to do…"</p><p>"Only the usual," I said, because nothing had come in for me and I wasn't expecting it to. It was nothing I couldn't put off to tomorrow, or wouldn't be redistributed to others.</p><p>Genma beamed. "Excellent," he said.</p><p>"So what's the catch?" I asked expectantly, raising an eyebrow at him.</p><p>He looked dramatically hurt. "There's no catch. Would I do that to you?"</p><p>I gave him an unimpressed look, but followed as he left.</p><p>"Seriously," he said, tucking his hands into his pockets and looking way more relaxed. "We're usually have enough relief staff for this kind of situation, only we're short on Special Jounin. And Hokage's orders are specifically that your teammate needs a ranking partner."</p><p>I paused. That was <em> true</em> but… "I don't think I really fit the <em> spirit</em> of that order," I said dubiously.</p><p>"You <em> are</em> a Special Jounin," he countered. Like that was his argument and he was going to stick to it, come hell or high water.</p><p>Well, yes, I was. But. I was still pretty sure I wasn't meant to count in this scenario. It was just a hunch.</p><p>"I'm sure you can handle it," he said. "Yeah, it's a perfect solution." He nodded, to himself.</p><p>I gave him a look but didn't protest. Patrol with Sasuke didn't sound bad, anyway. We hadn't had much time to catch up lately with him off doing mysterious Anbu things. And me being busy with everything I was busy with.</p><p>We got to the way station, and Genma sent me off with a wave. "Sasuke knows the route," he said vaguely. "He can fill you in."</p><p>I shrugged. That wasn't really how this was supposed to work, I was sure. But I trusted that Sasuke actually did know what he was doing.</p><p>Sasuke was waiting, leaning against one of the walls and looking both bored and highly unimpressed. "Huh," he said when he saw me. "How'd you get dragged into this?"</p><p>"Apparently they're short on Special Jounin?" I shrugged. "I wasn't doing anything interesting anyway."</p><p>Sasuke snorted. "That's only because the rest of them are as lazy as sensei," he said, turning to go. I followed, waiting until we were out of the station and out of earshot.</p><p>"Why are you here, anyway?" I asked, actually curious. "I thought you weren't on patrol anymore." On account of being in Anbu, went unsaid.</p><p>Sasuke shrugged. "I'm on the relief staff list," he said. "There's a whole lot of us that fill in when things happen and people are pulled off of the rotation or if the security level goes up."</p><p>And that, made sense, actually. Sasuke wasn't tied down permanently to anywhere, but he would still be visible enough, doing enough missions and patrols and things that people wouldn't be questioning where he <em> was</em> . Each particular assignment would be very day-by-day – and as long as he had a reasonable excuse, no one would be too shocked at not being able to find him at short notice. 'I was away training' surely counted when there were too many training fields to ever search.</p><p>It made so much sense that I wondered how many of the relief staff – generally people who I thought of as retired shinobi, or maybe parents looking for part time work – were actually Anbu giving themselves cover.</p><p>Because sure, there were some people who you just <em> knew</em> were Anbu – like Kakashi – but most of the time it was a secret. Not even an open secret, like things sometimes were in a ninja village, but an actual 'no one knows' secret.</p><p>We fell into an easy rhythm with each other, keeping step. Sasuke filled me in on where we were going and what we were doing and we traded comments back and forth that skirted the edges of things not talked about. I learnt that he was learning more kenjutsu and that his squad captain was 'pretty cool' though both things were so vague that it told me next to nothing.</p><p>Our route took us well out of the village proper, up the mountains and hills that existed outside the walls. We were paying attention, because that was what we were here for, but there was nothing of particular note.</p><p>"The river is low," I said absently, nothing important about it other than a vague point of conversation.</p><p>"Hasn't rained recently," Sasuke said, but without much interest. It was certain, though, a fact acknowledged and tucked away just in case it became relevant at any point. Being a ninja was all about collecting those little facts.</p><p>"Better watch out for puddles then," I suggested, because it reminded me of our first mission. It felt like so long ago.</p><p>Sasuke smirked, clearly making the same connection. We were going to end up with some of the weirdest Team 7 in-jokes.</p><p>"Hey," Sasuke said, head tilting curiously as he looked down at the river, "do you see that?"</p><p>We changed course, heading for the river and the outcropping of rock in the center.</p><p>There, just barely peeking out from the water line, were black lines on rock.</p><p>"Graffiti?" Sasuke suggested, though he didn't sound hopeful.</p><p>"You really think so?" I asked. We circled around it, onto the water and carefully closing the distance. If it was a trap, we didn't want to set it off. But there was equally no way we could ignore it.</p><p>"It could be," he argued. "Maybe. It's not <em> im</em> possible. "</p><p>Not impossible, no, but… "Not unless people started charging them with chakra when I wasn't looking," I said. "It's… weird."</p><p>"That is <em> exactly</em> what I want to hear," he sighed, though he didn't look terribly disappointed. He bit his thumb and went through a series of handseals, pressing his hand down on the water. A hawk burst out of the summoning jutsu, let out a screech, and alighted on his forearm. The talons probably didn't pierce through his arm protectors but he still winced.</p><p>I ignored him as he conveyed the messages to send to the patrol station, focusing on the seal. It <em> was</em> weird. I couldn't see it – the majority of it was under the water – but to my chakra sense it was slightly off.</p><p>"Yin chakra?" I wondered out loud.</p><p>But that wasn't quite right.</p><p>I wanted to be able to see it, to know what I was dealing with.</p><p>"Someone else will pick up the patrol," Sasuke told me, hovering over my shoulder as his hawk flew off, circling in the air above us as an indicator. "We get to stay and investigate the thing. What are we dealing with?"</p><p>"I have no idea," I said honestly. "It's an active seal. Whatever it's meant to do, it's already doing it. But we'll have to get this water out of the way so I can see what it is."</p><p>We both considered the river.</p><p>"Can we move the rock?" Sasuke suggested after a long moment.</p><p>I tapped my fingers against my thigh. "Should be able to. As long as we avoid the seal – I don't want to touch it with chakra until I know what it does. Or touch it at all," I amended.</p><p>It took us a few minutes and some complicated wire work to design a way to get the rock onto dry land. I ended up taking an unenthusiastic swim in order to judge how deep the seal went and performing my first ever underwater earth jutsu to cut the thing in half.</p><p>"You could have done that part," I grumbled, trying to wring the water out of my hair. It was <em> cold.</em></p><p>"I wouldn't have known where it stopped," Sasuke claimed, with the same kind of innocence as Genma saying 'there's no catch'. "What do I know about seals?"</p><p>I snorted. "Oh yes, such expert skill is needed to tell where the ink is."</p><p>"It could have washed away," he claimed. Then tilted his head, like it was a question he'd never thought to ask. "Could it have?"</p><p>Ah yes, seal metaphysics. The question that most people who asked wished they'd never thought to ask.</p><p>"Not really," I said. "If it was the type of seal that could wash away, it wouldn't still be there." I rubbed the back of my neck, half in thought, half trying to get the water to stop dripping down. "A seal isn't <em> ink</em> . Once it's been activated, I mean. It's a pathway full of chakra that makes things happen. And chakra is… you can't just wash it away, right?"</p><p>Things <em> could</em> wipe it away – chakra dissipated into the air naturally, for one, which was a big part of why chakra storage items didn't work well, and there were chakra devouring things like kikaichu. But that was a different topic. That was about the chakra, not about the ink.</p><p>"Right," Sasuke agreed with a shrug, like I was making sense. "You have to stop the chakra to stop the seal, then. Counter it, somehow." He considered the stone chunk that we'd freed from the water. "So what would happen if we just …. got rid of it. Crushed the rock?"</p><p>I winced. "Yeah. Well. I have no idea." I shrugged, defensively. "It's complicated. It depends on how robust the seal is. If it's not very robust then destroying the surface it's on might be enough to break the chakra paths. Like…" I searched for an example. "If you tear a storage scroll in half."</p><p>No, shit. Storage scrolls were terrible examples. They were time-space dimension warping bullshit.</p><p>"Anyway," I barreled onwards. "A fragile seal will probably fail if you disrupt it like that. The ink is what carries the chakra and forms the patterns, so separating the ink lines separates the chakra."</p><p>"But if it <em> is</em> more robust than that?" Sasuke prompted, gamely.</p><p>"If it is more robust than that, the chakra can hold itself together," I said. "With your seal the ink <em> moves</em> , you know." I ignored his flinch. Yes, that was probably a bad example too. "So the seal might transfer to a new surface, if there's something close. Or it might just… hang in the air because air is still a surface…"</p><p>I fluttered my hands, trying to punctuate my point. "I think this might be one of those. It's an odd location. Good for hiding it after the fact but not really an easy place to write a seal. But write it on a paper tag and then bam, stick it somewhere it'll be invisible. After a while the paper will probably get destroyed but your seal will outlast it."</p><p>"So basically," he summed up. "It's not an option and will probably just make things more complicated."</p><p>"Basically," I agreed. "Now let me work out what it actually does then I can tell you what we can actually do about it."</p><p>But mentioning Sasuke's seal had got me on the right track. I'd seen it expanded, when Jiraiya had been studying it, and it made certain parts of this seal eerily familiar in style.</p><p>"Hmm," I said, picking it apart with my eyes. Sasuke ran a perimeter, searched the area for any other seals or traps and generally did a whole bunch of ninja things so I could stand around staring at a rock.</p><p>"Nothing else around," he confirmed. "Do you know what it does?"</p><p>"I think so," I said. "But it's going to sound a little crazy."</p><p>He tilted his head, like he was considering that. "Well. If it's only a <em> little</em> crazy…"</p><p>"It's not exactly a storage seal," I explained, finger hovering over parts of it as I sounded out my theory. "Or, at least, of a <em> physical</em> item. But there are plenty of non-physical things people can seal. Chakra. Bijuu. Souls."</p><p>Orochimaru had done it, with Edo Tensei and with his Cursed Seal. Or at least, managed to seal some part of a soul with the last one. And it explained the odd unbalanced feeling of the seal – reminiscent of the way Kubisaki's ghost had felt.</p><p>"Souls," Sasuke repeated, raising an eyebrow at me. "Since I doubt you're implying there's a bijuu sealed here."</p><p>I hummed. "I think we might have a ghost in the machine. Or rock. As the case might be."</p><p>"Okay," Sasuke said slowly and, again, asked the real question. "But whose soul?"</p><p>I hovered my finger over the first part of the seal. "Kisuke," I read. "I think it's a name. If I was going to try and seal someone's soul, a name wouldn't be the <em> last</em> thing I'd try. It's descriptive and specific, as long as you actually know who you're dealing with."</p><p>Edo Tensei worked off of DNA, of having an actual physical tie for the soul you were trying to call back. Assuming that this person hadn't been retrieved from the afterlife, then the requirements for it might have been different.</p><p>"Wow." I blinked. "This is weird."</p><p>"It's not the <em> weirdest thing</em> we've done," Sasuke said. "We found a seal. Nothing has really even happened yet."</p><p>"I'm thinking about the afterlife," I said dryly. "I try to avoid that."</p><p>But he was right in that we actually needed to do something about it. We had a potential soul stuck in a seal on a rock. For unknown reason, by an unknown person, for an unknown length of time.</p><p>Friend or foe?</p><p>"I could make an interfacing seal, I think," I said. "See if we can draw them out. Then just… ask."</p><p>Sasuke nodded. Then shrugged. "If you think it'll work," he agreed. "I don't know how else we'd find out. There's bound to be dozens of ninja in Konoha alone named 'Kisuke'."</p><p>Baring a second name or something to cross reference it with, it would take us a long time to find anything with that. And even if we did find the right person, we might not even know we had. Maybe a Kisuke who had gone missing here – or died.</p><p>I pulled out some paper and got to work. There was an open clause in the seal, and if I hijacked that and gave an output mechanism…</p><p>"Okay," I said, and slapped it on the rock. "Let's see if it works."</p><p>I charged it with chakra, ready to bail if things went wrong.</p><p>There was a burst of chakra smoke. Then a man, standing there and staring at us in confusion. Maybe thirty or forty years old, with dark brown hair. He was wearing loose, casual looking clothes, and had no visible weapons.</p><p>Not that they would have done any good. Being a ghost and all.</p><p>"What happened? Who are you?" He demanded.</p><p>"That's our question," Sasuke shot back firmly. "On behalf of Konoha security – Identify yourself!"</p><p>"Kisuke Maboroshi," the ghost said. He looked around, uneasily. But oh, it was so clear he was a ninja – lost and confused, he was assessing the situation and working out what had happened. His gaze lingered across our faces, over the seal and stone, over the river and surroundings. He flexed his hands, then stared at them. "I was fighting…" he said, though more to himself than to us.</p><p>I let him sort it out. I wasn't sure how one went about saying 'sorry, you're actually dead'.</p><p>"I have to report in," he said suddenly, urgently. "They have to know-"</p><p>Sasuke stepped forward, as if to grab him.</p><p>But the body flicker that Kisuke tried to use never happened. Because he was a ghost and had no chakra and was tied to the seal.</p><p>I coughed, awkwardly. "Uh, yeah. That's not really going to work. But we'd also really like to report in with whatever is going on so we can help each other out here."</p><p>My very logical offer was brushed off with an agitated shake of the head. I cancelled the seal and he vanished again. I didn't know if he would be aware in there – the initial confusion suggested not – and it seemed a bit mean, but it would give us time to catch up on the information that we did have.</p><p>"Now we report it?" Sasuke suggested.</p><p>"Now we have a name," I corrected. "I want to grab his file and see who he is, first. But yeah, then we'll probably have to tell Tsunade-sama."</p><p>We used my lightsaber to cut the stone down to a slightly more manageable size, until it was basically a tablet with a seal on it, and wrapped it in my jacket in possibly the worst kind of disguise ever.</p><p>I didn't want to carry a seal like that into the information archives, though. So it stayed with Sasuke while I used my Intel clearance to bypass the security and find the file. I'd been down here often enough over the past month that it didn't take long to flick through the file cards to 'Maboroshi' and find out where it was located. That it was in the 'deceased' section was of absolutely no surprise, but he wasn't listed as KIA. Or even MIA.</p><p>I flicked through the – really, really sparse – file to explain the discrepancy. There was a brief medical report of a coma with no known cause from nearly a year ago and a death certificate from only a few days before the Chunin Exam Invasion.</p><p>Curiouser and curiouser.</p><p>There was no information on about a mission, or anything of <em> how</em> he had become sealed in a rock in the outskirts of the village. There were in fact, no missions listed for quite some time. I wondered if that meant he'd been working on his own – or if that meant Anbu. Which might explain why he hadn't wanted to explain anything to us and report in on his own.</p><p>I took the file, signing that I'd taken it by code reference number rather than by name. I had no idea if anyone was keeping tabs on Kisuke or not – or if they'd bother tracking the low clearance archives if they did – but it was better safe than sorry.</p><p>Then I went back to where Sasuke was waiting impatiently. People were giving him a fairly wide berth and strange looks, which he only replied to with the most bland expression of annoyance I had ever seen.</p><p>"Found it," I said.</p><p>Sasuke nodded. "Shizune was here," he said. "The Hokage isn't available. She's at the hospital."</p><p>Which probably meant it was either urgent, or would be a long time. Both of which meant it wasn't a good idea to disturb her. We could have waited, but more progress was better.</p><p>I sorted through our options then nodded decisively. "Follow me."</p><p>We went down, winding through the corridors to a place that I was visiting with rather more frequency than I ever thought I would visit T&amp;I.</p><p>I presented my ID and asked if Ibiki-taicho was in.</p><p>"Cause?" the ninja asked, sounding bored.</p><p>"Intel," I said automatically at the exact same time that Sasuke said, "Patrol."</p><p>We looked at each other. I shrugged. "Both."</p><p>That didn't exactly appear to impress anyone, but I wasn't going to get into the ghost story here. So vague non-reasons it would have to be.</p><p>Ibiki was sent for, though, thankfully. "The Nara girl is here for you again," the door guard said to him.</p><p>"Again?" Sasuke mouthed at me. Yes, that was interesting. Because this was the first time I'd asked for Ibiki.</p><p>"Another urgent delivery?" Ibiki asked, eyeing us.</p><p>"No, Ibiki-taicho," I said. "There's a situation that requires your expertise. Uhm. Do you have a briefing room? It's a little bit strange."</p><p>"Very well," he said, though the look had become interested. "Follow me." He nodded at the guard and we were let through.</p><p>Sasuke set the tablet down on the briefing room table and stripped it of the cover. We rattled through a quick explanation of what had happened and what we'd found and why we'd come here.</p><p>Ibiki's eyebrows climbed higher and higher on his face. "This is not a joke," he said. It wasn't exactly a question, but the fact that he felt like he needed the clarification said a lot.</p><p>"Not by us," I said. "And if it's <em> on</em> us, I'll be really annoyed too."</p><p>"I see," he said.</p><p>"I would have reported it to Tsunade-sama first," I went on. "But she's not available. And if he <em> is</em> Anbu then I'm not entirely sure what the next step would have been."</p><p>I could have taken it to dad – to the Jounin Commander – obviously, but taking it to Ibiki meant we were still making progress on the issue. T&amp;I was a place that was practically designed to handle sensitive information and decide what needed to be done with it.</p><p>Also… I wouldn't lie and say I didn't want to know what was going on here, and once it was out of our hands we would probably never find out.</p><p>"Set it up," Ibiki said, getting up and opening the door. "I'll have someone send for his information, and then we'll work out what's going on."</p><p>I set my interface seal up around the tablet which took all of about ten seconds. Sasuke and I sat at the table while we waited for Ibiki to return.</p><p>"As you can tell," I said, and yawned. "Intel missions are terribly exciting."</p><p>"Just like this, huh?" he said wryly. "I would say patrol is better, but this came from patrol."</p><p>"It's all going to be paperwork from here on out," I said, folding my arms on the table and dropping my chin onto them. "The most exciting part will be Ibiki asking him questions. If we're lucky we might get to hunt down whoever did it, though."</p><p>I doubted it, though. I had a feeling that would be taken out of our hands and be someone else's job. Assuming that whoever did this in the first place was still in Konoha.</p><p>"We <em> are</em> lucky," Sasuke said hopefully, leaning back in his chair to stare at the ceiling. "It's in the name. I could hunt someone down. You could hunt someone down. You're a tracking ninja."</p><p>Ibiki came back with a personnel file that was much thicker than the one we'd brought with us, but wouldn't let us see it. Classified, probably.</p><p>Then he told me to activate the seal.</p><p>I did.</p><p>"-port immediately!" Kisuke said, agitated, finishing what he'd been saying before I'd cut him off. He stopped. Blinked. Looked around. The change in location must have been slightly jarring.</p><p>"Kisuke Maboroshi," Ibiki greeted. "I'm told you have something to report?"</p><p>Kisuke was much more accommodating now that Ibiki was involved, as anyone would have been. Ibiki had been in charge for longer than Kisuke had been 'dead' so he must have recognized him at least.</p><p>Kisuke had been investigating something – from Anbu, so score one for assumptions – and it had lead him to someone named Sabiru who had been in charge of some kind of defense plan. And given how the Invasion had turned out, that seemed relevant to the conversation at hand. Sabiru had, in turn, worked out he was being investigated and tried to get rid of him.</p><p>"I was off duty," Kisuke said ruefully, which at least explained why he wasn't in Anbu uniform. That would have been much more recognizable. "I wasn't on guard. He said… he said something about my wife. Do you know if she's okay?"</p><p>He didn't look hopeful.</p><p>Ibiki didn't look at the file. Had already read it and knew the answer to this question. "There was a fire at your house," he said. "Your wife perished in the blaze."</p><p>Had been murdered, most likely.</p><p>Kisuke closed his eyes. "I see. And then I died and it seemed as though I had simply snapped from grief. Sabiru got away with everything. "</p><p>He hadn't died at the time, but there also hadn't been any kinds of suspicions raised in the medical report. No signs of fighting, no obvious causes to the coma that indicated someone had attacked him. The seal itself might not have been <em> meant</em> to last – simply meant to be a method of killing that wouldn't arose suspicion.</p><p>"Until now," Ibiki corrected. "Though it might be late you have still completed your mission and revealed the actions of a traitor. It is no small thing. You have done well."</p><p>We were dismissed not long after that, sent off with the warning that this was classified and we weren't to talk about it.</p><p>"Do we at least get to hunt down this 'Sabiru'?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"If Anbu was already investigating him, they'll want to finish this," Ibiki said, amused. "And that's if he hasn't already been found since the Invasion. The Hokage has been very thorough in her investigations."</p><p>"Well," I said, stretching my shoulders. "Maybe next patrol we'll just get attacked or something."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next day saw me practicing my summoning jutsu by Sembei's house, as I had been since I'd signed the scroll.</p><p>Hey, Heijomaru had <em> encouraged</em> me to call him for practically no reason. I wasn't going to pass that up. I needed the practice, and I really wanted to start building a relationship with the deer in the contract. Signing the thing was just the first step – I could call them, but I couldn't actually force them to do anything. That was entirely down to their willingness to work with me.</p><p>Heijomaru came first, as he always did. Given that my later attempts at calling the deer were less precise, I suspected that was much more to do with him than with me.</p><p>"Good morning, Daughter of the Forest," he said, as he always did. I was beginning to wonder what the name meant. It <em> sounded</em> like it ought to have been important.</p><p>"Good morning, Heijomaru," I returned. "Thank you for coming."</p><p>There were a smattering of young Nara children around watching, seeming delighted by the summons. I'd worried the first time they'd been here, but Sembei hadn't and Heijomaru had tolerated them climbing all over him with a resigned sort of fondness.</p><p>I watched him settle on the veranda by Sembei's rocking chair and returned to try my summoning jutsu again. I was aiming for Gemmei, a doe that seemed reasonably knowledgeable about both the human and summon worlds and the history of both.</p><p>"Summoning Jutsu!" I called, spilling the chakra out through my fingers. I felt the call rattle through and could almost, <em> almost</em> feel it connect to something on the other side. I had to learn how to direct it better.</p><p>It was honestly a little humbling how easily Naruto had learnt this and how much harder it was than I was expecting. After his initial troubles, he'd never seemed to have any problems picking <em> who</em> to call.</p><p>That was harder than anticipated.</p><p>"Summon lady!" chittered the tiny fawn that I'd managed to summon instead. He bounced around me in a circle, wiggling with excitement. "You called, you called."</p><p>"Hello Nagaoka," I said, smiling at him instead of letting my disappointment show. He was a delight, anyway. Not someone I'd want to summon in combat, but he was always happy to come. Too young to have known Sembei when she was an active kunoichi his reasons weren't the same as his older allies. "Would you like a treat?"</p><p>I held out one of the little deer biscuits I'd brought with me. He nibbled it from my fingers, then pressed forward towards me.</p><p>I tumbled backwards onto the ground, not having expecting a shoulder charge. His long gangling legs trod over and on mine as he folded downwards, sitting on me.</p><p>No matter how small and cute, fawns were not made to be lap animals.</p><p>I 'ooffed', and made sure my hands weren't somewhere they'd get stood on. "It's nice to see you too," I laughed and scritched behind his ears.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Warnings for the butchering of Japanese New Year celebration traditions, I guess. Konoha is unique?</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 109</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance. ~ </em> <em> Alan Watts</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"At least say if I'm getting closer," Aoba said across the table. "Hotter or colder."</p><p>"Classified," I singsonged to him, the same way I'd been answering his questions for the better part of an hour. I didn't really dare say anything else – I wasn't really good at coming up with things. I didn't think he <em> really</em> expected me to tell him anything, he was just poking out of boredom and habit. But if he did shake anything loose then he would be all over it. That's just the way it was. So I was saying nothing.</p><p>"So Sasuke was carrying something. Something heavy. A statue. A Buddha statue. That was possessed and tried to kill you."</p><p><em> How did he come up with these things?</em> I gave him a strange look. "What would it have been possessed by?"</p><p>He shrugged. "A spirit? A demon? Oh. A demon possessed Buddha statue tried to kill you!"</p><p>"Classified," I reminded him.</p><p>He slumped. "Not a statue, then. Okay. So you were soaking wet. There was an underwater secret tunnel. Mist ninja were camping in it. No, not Mist ninja? It went somewhere, though."</p><p>"Class-i-fied."</p><p>He made a sound of pure frustration.</p><p>I escaped that conversation by the grace of being called up to the Hokage's office. Actually not to the Hokage's office itself, but to a small briefing room not that far away, by the Hokage so it was basically the same thing in the end.</p><p>Shizune met me there and Tsunade arrived before too long. Once the door was shut and the security system engaged, Kisuke materialized from… somewhere which at least told me what this meeting was about.</p><p>Tsunade took a seat at the table and put a paper tag face up on the surface. The seal was identical to the one that had been printed on the rock yesterday. "Tell me what you know about the Soul-Body Separation Seal," she said, going straight into the topic.</p><p>I blinked at her, and after a moment of silence managed to rattle off most of the conclusions that I'd given to Sasuke yesterday.</p><p>"Similar to the curse seal, you say?" She said thoughtfully, pressing her fingers to her lips. But her gaze was canted sideways, looking out the window over the village.</p><p>"Yes," I said. "I mean… it's not enough to say Orochimaru created it. But he wouldn't be my last pick either."</p><p>"You wouldn't be wrong," she said. "He did. But it was many, many years ago." She was silent for a long moment.</p><p>It was… strange to remember that Tsunade and Orochimaru had been teammates, once. That they'd been <em> young</em> . That they'd been Konoha shinobi, not so different to us, to how we were now.</p><p>"This technique," she said, "was meant to be a scouting jutsu. Similar to the Yamanaka jutsu or… the Kato clan jutsu. It would allow a shinobi to separate their spirit from their body, then deploy as an undetectable scout into enemy territory. With the original seal they were only visible to a single handler rather than completely, as Kisuke is now."</p><p>I blinked, and shuffled the information I knew about the seal into that new pattern. "Wow," I said.</p><p>Because… wow. Yeah. I could see why Konoha would have wanted that. Holy hell, could I see why Konoha wanted that.</p><p>"So, what was the catch?" I asked. Because with those benefits there <em> had</em> to be a downside big enough to explain why it wasn't in use. "The spirit couldn't reattach to the body?"</p><p>The Hokage nodded. "It was unreliable," she admitted, fingers tapping on the table. "And each successive use of the seal dramatically reduced the possibility of reconciliation. Sarutobi-sensei eventually forbade the usage of it and listed it as a forbidden technique."</p><p>I nodded. Then my eyes drifted across the table to Kisuke. Because I could also see where this was going. If the problem had been returning to their bodies afterwards…</p><p>Well. He was already dead. There was no body to return to.</p><p>"You aren't going to…" I halted, fumbling for words. <em> Die? Move on? </em> "Cancel the seal, are you?"</p><p>Kisuke hesitated, eyes flicking towards the Hokage but she waited and let him answer. "It has been a shock," he said carefully, "to wake up and find myself dead. It does not feel quite real. And though I would like to find my wife it… it is a strange thing to have the <em> choice</em> between life and death. There are other ties binding me to life – other people I would like to see again, to help. I still feel as though I have a duty to this village, a job to do. If you will forgive the saying… I am not dead yet."</p><p>And there was the steel of a shinobi, the will to go just that little bit further. <em> I am not dead yet.</em> He was, but he wasn't. Alive enough to think, to feel, to want to live just a little bit longer.</p><p>"It sets a terrible precedent," Tsunade acknowledged, "binding our shinobi to the village beyond the limit of life itself. I don't like it very much. But I'd be a fool to pass up the opportunity, especially now. That's why you're here." Her gaze snapped back to me.</p><p>I sat up straighter.</p><p>"You've already proven that you can alter the seal," she said. "I'm assigning you a classified mission to do so again – to alter it in such a way that Kisuke can control. Ideally, a way in which he can be visible, a way in which he can be <em> in</em> visible, and a way to release himself at any time he desires."</p><p>I bit my lip and thought it over. "It might be hard to find a way for Kisuke to interface with it, but the first and second tasks shouldn't be that difficult," I said cautiously. "The first is what my alternations have already done. The second is what you said the seal was <em> meant</em> to do without those alterations. The third…"</p><p>How did you cancel a jutsu from inside the jutsu?</p><p>Actually, how did a ghost control a seal at all?</p><p>Maybe that was going to be more difficult than I thought. I frowned.</p><p>"There are," Tsunade said slowly, "some notes that were left behind."</p><p>"Orochimaru's notes," I clarified after a long, long silence.</p><p>"Yes," she affirmed. "As you might guess, I'm not exactly eager to hand them over to you. There were a lot of facets to his research, sealing was only part of it. There was human experimentation. Bloodlimits. Cloning."</p><p>It felt like a test.</p><p>Scratch that. There was no way it <em> wasn't</em> a test. The trick was finding out what it was a test <em> for.</em></p><p>I shrugged a shoulder. "I'm not really interested in any of that," I said. "Cloning is easy. All you'd need is a tissue sample and someone with a functioning uterus."</p><p>That might have been too flippant. Probably, <em> definitely</em> too flippant. And irrelevant besides, because Orochimaru's cloning experiments had been much more about grafting bloodlimits onto existing people than actually creating clones from scratch.</p><p>I barreled onwards. "If he left any notes on the use of Edo Tensei then I might be interested in those. I mean, I know he used it and, uh, it's pretty much exactly related to what's happening here. The two techniques might be related? That or anything on the curse seal, because I <em> know</em> the two have similarities."</p><p>I … doubted I would be allowed and I might have been tipping my hand by asking. But I couldn't pass up the chance, either. Yes, it would probably be useful for altering this seal, but both sets of information would be incredibly useful.</p><p>"We'll see," she temporized, rising from the table. Which wasn't a yes, but wasn't a <em> no</em> either. I could work with that. "Shizune will oversee your work – schedule your time with her."</p><p>That made sense. Shizune undoubtedly had the access to get whatever classified material required for this, and no one would raise an eyebrow about it. She was a medical ninja, so she at least understood that part of sealing and – if I wasn't mistaken – she was the last of the Kato clan.</p><p>"Yes, Hokage-sama," I agreed. "Shizune-senpai?"</p><p>We got down to the business of working out when we could, actually, get down to business.</p><p>So between all the things demanding my time, I was almost surprised when New Year's snuck up on me. Konoha had a massive New Year's Eve Festival every year and it pretty much lasted from the afternoon games to the ringing of the bells at midnight to the taiko drums at dawn. Given that I was working the evening shift, I figured I would miss most of it. It was disappointing, but not overtly heartbreaking.</p><p>"Nah, our shift ends at eleven," Aoba said casually when I mentioned it. "I mean, they don't kick you out or anything, so you can stay if you want to. But who wants to?"</p><p>I blinked. "Really?"</p><p>"Of course! Even bureaucracy knows we want to go to the festival."</p><p>I gave him a doubtful look.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, I know, right?" He laughed. "Now, I'm not naming any <em> names</em> or anything like that, you understand, but a few years ago…"</p><p>I listened, my eyebrows creeping up higher and higher.</p><p>"-and it took them twelve hours to get all the pieces out of the ceiling."</p><p>"Wow," I said, nonplussed. "I assume that's why the fireworks times are posted on the noticeboard?"</p><p>There was a saying that if you had a rule for something, it was because that thing had <em> happened.</em> And while it might have seemed like common sense to let a whole bunch of jumpy ninja know in advance when you were going to be making sudden loud noises, it seemed like the saying was in full force here.</p><p>"I can neither confirm nor deny," he said, amused.</p><p>The mood was pretty jovial in the office, as though the feeling of the festival was drifting inside. Anyone who went out to deliver things generally came back with a tray full of treats for the rest, or other silly miscellany.</p><p>I wasn't the only one eating the traditional end of year soba for dinner, either, and we toasted each other good luck and best wishes over noodles.</p><p>"I brought my yukata with me," Shiho told me. "I'm just going to go straight there when I finish."</p><p>"That's clever," I said. "I have to go home first." For family, more than to get changed, really.</p><p>"Maybe next year," she said and patted me on the arm. "We could go together."</p><p>There was a rush for the doors when the clock ticked over. Ours wasn't the only department that was eager to leave, and the lobby of the tower was packed full of people wishing each other a happy new year. I tried to see if I could pick Shikamaru out of the crowd, but mostly just went with the flow until I could spill out onto the streets.</p><p>"I'll save you a drink," Aoba said, hand on my shoulder, referring to the Special Jounin social gathering he'd invited me to. "Show up at some point."</p><p>I made vague not-promises and waved.</p><p>Then I bounded across the street to where a tall dark form was waiting patiently. "Hi, dad." He generally worked daytime hours, but it wasn't exactly unusual for us to all leave the tower at the same time, nowadays, either.</p><p>"How was work?" He asked, arm looping around me.</p><p>I yawned and leant against him. "Work." Shikamaru was probably taking his time and leaving later to avoid the crush of people since he didn't appear to have snuck out early. It was smart, sure, but now we had to wait for him.</p><p>The flow of people slowed to a trickle. Shikamaru slouched out, talking idly with someone I didn't recognize. He looked up and saw us.</p><p>"Didn't think you'd wait," he said by way of apology.</p><p>Dad waved it off. "New Years is a family holiday. We should be making the most of it." <em> We don't have that much time normally</em> went acknowledged but unsaid.</p><p>We left the sounds of the festival behind, the music and the echoes of laughter in the night air. Home was a quiet oasis compared to that, right up until we walked inside and mum was immediately onto us.</p><p>"You sure took your time getting home," she scolded. "Hurry up and get dressed. We'll miss it!"</p><p>She was already dressed up, kimono bright with colours and patterns and hair done up for once in an elaborate twist.</p><p>"You look nice!" I called as I darted up the stairs to get changed. It didn't take long to put on a kimono, and I only curled my braid into a bun and stuck a decorative comb into it. Such effort.</p><p>There was a knock on the front door while I was getting ready, but I wasn't surprised to feel Sasuke's chakra. It was out of his way to be here, which meant that it was a deliberate move. I hoped it was because nothing was going wrong.</p><p>That would be typical.</p><p>But when I went downstairs he was dressed up too, in dark blue, looking uncomfortable while mum fluffed over him and tried to give food. "You're right on time," she claimed. "The rest of these lazy sods aren't ready yet."</p><p>"I am," I said, managing to keep my yukata unrumpled while I sat down. "So that's another victory to the women of the family."</p><p>I could hear Shikamaru's grumbling from the living room. "We're not all in such a hurry," he claimed. And he actually looked like he'd put half an effort into getting ready compared to his usual none.</p><p>Outside, all the temples across Konoha started ringing the one hundred and eight bells to welcome in the new year. The sound travelled and echoed like a symphony.</p><p>Dad came down stairs and mum bustled away, bringing a tray laden with a teapot and sake cups. Toso was a kind of spiced sake, traditional to drink on New Year's celebrations, for luck and health. Like, literally to chase away the evil spirits, but I mostly went with the 'luck and health' explanation.</p><p>The sake was poured and we passed the saucers around. Mum toasted but didn't drink any, which was unusual for her. I didn't exactly like the taste much myself, but it wasn't like we were drinking very much of it and it was tradition.</p><p>Sasuke looked awkward, as I passed the cup to him. It was a family thing, but he had been very deliberately invited and included. And not even by me. I couldn't claim that one. It was… nice.</p><p>We finished the sake and started to head back to town to join the festival.</p><p>"Here," Dad said, taking out three decorated envelopes, absolutely casually and handing them to us. "Try not to spend it all at once."</p><p>Otoshidama - also a tradition. Kind of like pocket money to celebrate the start of the year.</p><p>"I absolutely will," I promised him, and grabbed Sasuke by the elbow to drag him along because he looked kind of frozen.</p><p>"They didn't need to do that," Sasuke muttered quietly to me, after a few false starts.</p><p>"It's not about <em> need</em> ," I said, glancing back at mum and dad walking arm in arm. They were taking their time. "Come on. I'll race you!"</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Shikako!" Ino called merrily, waving across the street. Sakura was with her, looking apologetic. "There you are!"</p><p>I clinked glasses with Sasuke and ducked out of the food stall. He nodded to me, but kept on talking to Hayate and his purple haired girlfriend about swords. There were opinions being had. Mine apparently didn't count. Well, the joke was on them because my sword went 'zshoom'.</p><p>"Shikamaru isn't with you?" Ino asked, eyes darting up and down the street.</p><p>I shrugged. "We lost him somewhere. He must have gone to find Chouji."</p><p>She looked briefly surprised. "We didn't see him. He's probably hiding in a corner somewhere. We were going to go and find somewhere nice to watch the last fireworks."</p><p>"Down by the river?" I suggested. "They were doing a fire dancing display on the lake the last I saw."</p><p>"Ooh," Sakura said happily. "That always looks so amazing. I hope it's still going."</p><p>I didn't disagree. Fire dancing was always something. Ninja doing fire dancing was <em> spectacular. </em></p><p>It wasn't so crowded anymore, because it was nearly five am now. We were going to greet the dawn celebrations from the wrong side, this year.</p><p>"Is that…" Sakura asked slowly, hesitantly. "Shikamaru? And <em> Tenten?</em> "</p><p>Ino and I both swiveled around to look.</p><p>"They must have run into each other," I said with a shrug. It wasn't like they didn't know each other – she had been working with us on seals for ages now.</p><p>Ino looked at me. She looked back at them. "That," she pronounced, "is a date."</p><p>I blinked. "Huh," I said thoughtfully. "I didn't see that coming."</p><p>"No," Ino agreed. "Neither did I."</p><p>And she sounded… she sounded…</p><p>I looked at her more closely, and then gave Sakura a vaguely alarmed look hoping that she would help. She was better at emotions than me. "Oh," I said. "Oh. I didn't see that coming either. You-"</p><p>Ino swatted me on the arm and made a face. "Oh, no. No. Absolutely not. I would kill him within a week. You Nara aren't <em> that</em> irresistible."</p><p>"But who could resist our good looks and inability to give a fuck," I deadpanned, feeling so, so glad. Not that, you know, it was bad. But. I was feeling hugely off kilter.</p><p>Sakura scolded me for swearing. We barely even noticed the fireworks going off over our heads.</p><p>"It's just – how did <em> Shikamaru</em> become the first of us to get a date?" Ino complained. "How did that happen? It's not right."</p><p>I opened my mouth. I closed it again. I pleaded desperately with my eyes for Sakura to say something.</p><p>"It's not right," Sakura agreed, shoulders sinking and arms wrapping around herself. "He's so lazy. It's not fair."</p><p>Oh, great. Now they were <em> both</em> sad about being single.</p><p><em> Shikamaru, you are in trouble</em> , I tried to transmit to him with my brain. Since I wasn't Ino, it didn't really work.</p><p>"It's not a big deal," I said lightly. "Come on, who would you even date if you had the chance?"</p><p>"Sasuke," Sakura sighed dreamily.</p><p>Ino groaned. "I don't even know," she moaned. "But there should be someone that's interested in me. I'm <em> me.</em> "</p><p>"Yes, you are," I agreed and patted her lightly on the back. "And that's an amazing thing to be."</p><p>"You're not even the littlest bit bothered by this, are you?" she asked. "Shikako." My name sounded like a whine.</p><p>No, I wasn't. About Tenten and Shikamaru? I hadn't seen it coming at all, and I actually thought he had a bit of a thing for Temari. But that didn't make it <em> bad.</em> And Tenten was a friend and I had no problems with her, and if that was what Shikamaru wanted to do then that was that. As for feeling left behind…</p><p>"Nah," I decided.</p><p>"If you were a normal person who cared about romance, though, would you?" She persisted.</p><p>I huffed in exasperation. "That's like asking 'if you were a bird, would you fly?'" I said. "I doubt it, anyway. I barely have enough time to catch up with you guys as it is. I don't need to try and add more people into my life."</p><p>That didn't seem to cheer her up any.</p><p>I gave up and went to my last resort, and pulled a bottle of sake out of hammerspace. It was supposed to be a gift, but I would use whatever distraction I could, right now. "Come on, don't mope. That's no way to start the year off. We're supposed to be celebrating!"</p><p>"Oh, this is a bad idea," Ino said, as she plucked off the lid and took a sip. "You are a terrible friend."</p><p>She passed it to Sakura because she was also a terrible friend.</p><p>I grinned. "The o-shogatsu celebrations at the temple start in two hours. Other than that, the night is yours."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Intelligence Division Arc: Chapter 110</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: This chapter should answer most of the questions that people keep bombarding me with, up to and including 'what is she wearing'. There you go. Mystery solved.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 110</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Time flies over us, but leaves its shadow behind.~ </em> <em> Nathaniel Hawthorne</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Back again, huh?" I asked, pausing in the door of Kakashi-sensei's hospital room. "If I didn't know better I'd think you liked this place."</p><p>"Lucky you know better," Kakashi-sensei said dryly, favoring me with an annoyed look. But he was awake and upright so things couldn't be too bad. And still here, even, though that might have been because Tsunade had hunted him down last time he'd left early.</p><p>"She said if I left again, I'd have to teach at the Academy," he confirmed morosely, rolling a scroll back and forwards in his hands.</p><p>"Harsh," I said sympathetically. "I'm not sure who would get the worse end of that deal – you or the students."</p><p>He looked faux wounded. "I'm an amazing sensei."</p><p>"Sure," I agreed, straight faced. I wasn't arguing.</p><p>"Just for that, you're my least favourite student," he informed me loftily.</p><p>I laughed. "Demoted for agreeing with you? I see how it is." I nodded at the scroll he was toying with. "You have a new mission already?"</p><p>He glanced down at it. "Not quite," he said ruefully. "Tsunade's forming a new team and she wants me to head it."</p><p>Now that was actually surprising. I blinked. "What <em> kind</em> of team?" I asked. What kind of things did Konoha not already do?</p><p>"Maybe 'new' is the wrong word," he temporized. "It's more the revival of something that's been out of use for a while."</p><p>That still didn't give me any more information. I raised eyebrows at him meaningfully.</p><p>"It's an in-village role," he said, which made it stranger that he seemed to be considering it. "Planning and tactics. That kind of thing."</p><p>"Doesn't really sound like you," I said, a little puzzled now. Kakashi-sensei was a field ninja. And more than that, he was a well-known one. It didn't make sense to keep him in the village for <em> planning.</em></p><p>"It's War Operations," he said.</p><p>I sat down in the visitors chair. "That… would explain it."</p><p>Were things that bad that Tsunade was starting to form squads for <em> war?</em> Was pulling elite Jounin from the field for it? I couldn't quite wrap my head around it.</p><p>"It's mostly a bluff," Kakashi said, eyes fixed on the scroll. "Cloud thinks that if they keep pushing, then we'll back down. Once we don't, they'll have to reassess. They don't really want to go to war any more than we do."</p><p>That was probably meant to be reassuring. But I felt like 'a bluff' was a massive understatement. Even if it was mostly just a front to look strong, it still put the option of <em> war</em> on the table.</p><p><em> Weren't the Chunin Exams meant to prevent this? </em></p><p>"Back down from what?" I asked. "It's not like we're demanding anything." There was nothing to back down <em> from</em> . And nowhere to back down to, either.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei didn't answer that. Whether it was because he couldn't tell me, or because there was no answer…</p><p>"Are you going to take it?" I asked, changing tacks just slightly. If we truly did go to war, then there would be no separate team or division for it – all of Konoha would be turned to the cause. That didn't mean prior planning and preparation wouldn't be crucially important.</p><p>"She makes a convincing argument," he muttered. "There'd be less hospital visits, anyway."</p><p>"Always an important consideration," I agreed, as lightly as I could.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The rest of January started to slip away with an almost frightening speed.</p><p>I was always busy, though never quite as much as those first few weeks as Special Jounin. I'd been called away a few times on Sensory Squad missions – some with Tsume that I'd been directly requested for, some that felt more like my name had come out of a hat to fill an empty spot – as well as running Intel missions.</p><p>And then there was training and more training and seal work, both for the Nara and for Tsunade.</p><p>"Given that Kisuke lacks chakra to interact with the seal," I started when it came time to report to the Hokage on the progress we'd made. It was all written down in the reports I'd handed over, but she wanted me to summarize it. "We created an interface that channels spiritual energy in order to control it. So he can switch between the visible and invisible modes."</p><p>"And the termination seal?" she asked.</p><p>That was… harder. "The seal can obviously be cancelled in the usual ways," I said, "by interrupting the sealing pattern. Obviously that's not really an option for Kisuke and it would mean that he'd have to get to the seal as well. Which might not be possible if he was stuck in the field?"</p><p>I wasn't quite sure what kind of things could trap a ghost somewhere, but nothing was impossible. And if he was stuck, how would anyone come after him?</p><p>"It's not exactly something we can <em> test</em> ," I continued. "But I think we can build a seal that would… cut the ties that bind him here. And then, without an anchor he would just, uhm, move on."</p><p>"You think?" Tsunade asked, lacing her fingers together beneath her chin.</p><p>I gave a fairly helpless shrug. "It's not something I've done before," I said. "Nor a topic I'm experienced in. But Shizune agrees that the theory is sound."</p><p>Shizune was an experienced medical ninja and had a medical ninja's perspective and knowledge of seals. And of chakra and the energies that made it. I half thought she could have done all this herself given that she was the one with all the access to the old notes – the only things I'd really had to add had been things I'd cribbed from the Book of Gelel and none of that had exactly had to do with souls and ghosts either.</p><p>"There are other modifications that could be made," I went on. "For one, there's a limited distance that Kisuke can travel away from the seal. That will make reconnaissance difficult. I'm not sure how to go about changing that, though."</p><p>Increasing the power or stability of the seal so that it had a greater reach? Linking it to other seals so that the connection could 'jump' between them? That still had downsides because it meant someone would have to visit each location to plant a seal before Kisuke could go there to investigate.</p><p>"Keep working on it," she said. "But if the invisibility seal is functional, then I'm going to reinstate Kisuke into Anbu."</p><p>I nodded in acknowledgement and let myself out with the dismissal. That wasn't entirely unexpected – I could do just as much with a blank copy of the seal at this point, and Kisuke had been complaining about being bored. Well, not complaining. He was much too professional and stoic for that. But there was only so much you could <em> do</em> as a ghost.</p><p>I ran into Shizune on my way out of the tower, and impulsively invited her to the Kunoichi Group that I was headed to.</p><p>"Oh," she said, "I've heard about that. Isn't it a bit exclusive? I don't want to intrude."</p><p>I blinked. "No, not at all. Anko and Kurenai-sensei both come, and you know Sakura. Everyone will be thrilled for you to come."</p><p>They probably would be – we were ostentatiously a medical study group and the only person better would be Tsunade herself. And Shizune was a poison specialist as well, which would please Ino. It was a very unforgiving subject to try and learn.</p><p>"I hear you're making a bid for Jounin?" She said politely to Anko, which sounded like small talk. It wasn't something I had heard before, though, and I filed it away.</p><p>Anko, surprisingly, made a face. "That's just a rumor," she denied. "It's not true at all."</p><p>"Oh?" Shizune said, surprised. "I heard it from Gai-san. He sounded quite certain."</p><p>Anko groaned and put her face into her hands. "I wish he'd stop telling people that!"</p><p>Kurenai laughed, completely unsympathetic. "He's very difficult to dissuade once he has decided on something," she said. "Think about it this way – if you do become a Jounin, then you could be a Jounin sensei."</p><p>"Yeah, maybe," Anko said, though her eyes cut away to rest on Yakumo.</p><p>I left them to it. "So, Sakura, how's training?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Before I knew it, my rotation in the Cryptanalysis team was over. We didn't exactly have a farewell party – people came and went all the time, it was a normal occurrence – but I brought cake and biscuits to share, to say thanks.</p><p>"Are you really going back to field work?" Shiho asked, seeming distressed. "You could stay! You're great at this."</p><p>"Ah," I said awkwardly. "I'll still be around. I'll help out when I'm free."</p><p>"You better," Aoba agreed, slinging an arm over my shoulders. "After all the effort we put into training you up. I don't want that to go to waste."</p><p>He didn't seem surprised that I wasn't staying, but then, I'd never pretended that I was. And my position within the team had remained very vague and ill-defined. I was a floating team member who could do a little bit of everything.</p><p>"I suppose you have a lot to do," Shiho agreed, though a little morosely. I felt bad. She had been very helpful and understanding every time I'd had to run off and do something else.</p><p>But as it turned out, the biggest surprise of the new year wasn't mine.</p><p>"We have some news for you," Mum said, sitting the entire family down after dinner one night, her and dad on one side of the table, Shika and I on the other.</p><p>She was smiling, looking more happy than worried. I figured it couldn't be anything too bad.</p><p>"We're going to have another baby," she said.</p><p><em> What.</em> I looked at Shikamaru. He looked as taken aback as I felt. Nope, okay, he hadn't seen this coming either.</p><p>I… most certainly had not seen this coming. I was pretty sure… I was pretty sure Shikamaru hadn't had any siblings Before. The only baby of importance in the story had been Kurenai's and given how tightly that plot had wound around Shikamaru I was <em> sure</em> it would have been mentioned.</p><p>Then again, they hadn't had me then either. And these were the people that were the closest, were the most changed simply because I was here. Was it so surprising that they were making different choices?</p><p>Still.</p><p>"Why?" I asked, baffled. Fourteen years between kids was a bit of a gap.</p><p>"Because I want to," she said, a bit tartly.</p><p>Okay, sure. That was really the only reason that mattered in the end. And maybe that was it, a simple desire for another child now that Shikamaru and I were both shinobi and gone for missions as often as not.</p><p>I looked at Shikamaru again.</p><p>"When?" he asked, after a moments pause. I nodded. That was probably the next logical question to ask.</p><p>"August," Mum said. "I'm about twelve weeks along now."</p><p>The silence stretched out. I tried to think of something to say. "What are you going to do about rooms?" There. That was something nice and practical. It would need space for a bedroom.</p><p>Dad nodded. "We'll convert the downstairs study into a bedroom," he said. "It doesn't get much use anyway. One of you can move downstairs."</p><p>"I'll do it," Shika and I both volunteered at the same time.</p><p>"My room is closer to theirs," I said. "Makes more sense to turn it into a nursery." Or back into one, as the case might have been.</p><p>"There's plenty of time to work it out," Dad said, raising a hand with an amused look. "Don't go arguing over it just yet."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"I look like an idiot," I grumbled, adjusting my vest for the tenth time. My regular field outfit had been consigned to the rag heap and I'd had the bright idea of replacing it with something a little more durable with a bit more protection. I just hadn't expected it to end up being so complicated.</p><p>"You look just fine," Mum said, batting my hands away. She nodded to the salesperson who was helping to fit me. "Very professional. Mature."</p><p>Well, there was that. Kunoichi Under Armor might not have been extremely common but it did look very stereotypically ninja. Blacks and greys and wire mesh, with padding and joint support and stretch. Pretty much everything that an active ninja would want in an outfit.</p><p>It was just, yknow, tight. Even with the vest overtop, it was more form fitting than I was really comfortable with. "I need pants."</p><p>"A modesty skirt," Mum suggested as an alternate. "Or wide pouches, in case you need to carry things."</p><p>I did like having storage. Pockets and pouches. But hammerspace made that pretty much obsolete. I could carry everything I needed a lot more easily. I picked out some forearm guards and boots with built in shin protectors, both in the bone white of Anbu grade material. They'd make good writing surfaces for seals I didn't want to put directly on myself just yet.</p><p>"Any preferences on the colour?" the salesperson asked, making notes. "It should be ready within a few days."</p><p>I shrugged. "The black is fine." It wasn't exactly something I wanted <em> bright.</em></p><p>"Green piping," Mum added. "And the Nara crest on the right shoulder, please."</p><p>I changed back into my clothes and left the store with a heavy sigh. "If I ever suggest something like that again, please stop me."</p><p>Mum laughed. "Not a chance, dear," she said. "I quite enjoyed that. I would have liked something like that when I was your age. You'll be the envy of all the girls. And the boys." She winked.</p><p>I made a face at her. "I'd rather not."</p><p>Two days later when it was delivered to our doorstep, I still felt like an idiot, but put it on with resignation. Best to get used to it. My fringe was getting too long to leave in bangs without them getting in the way, so I swept it all back into the braid, leaving my face clear except for a few flyaways that stubbornly refused to submit.</p><p>"You look like just your mother," Dad said fondly, when I tramped downstairs, all irritation and early morning grumpiness.</p><p>I tried not to scowl at him.</p><p>"Yes," he said. "<em> Exactly</em> like your mother."</p><p><em> So funny.</em></p><p>But I couldn't hold the attitude for long because Shika and I had been called to the tower for a mission. It would be the first time I was actually given leadership of a mission. Intentionally, not just something that happened along the way. And while I knew that logically there would be very little difference between being team leader and just being… the voice of reason, it did make me a little nervous.</p><p>"It's an A-rank body guarding and escort mission," Tsunade informed us. "The client is Michiru Tsuki, the prince of the Land of the Moon. He's currently taking a tour of the Elemental Nations, and Land of Fire is the last stop on the tour. You'll meet him at the border to Wind Country and escort him all the way back to Land of the Moon."</p><p>It sounded fairly straight forward. I nodded.</p><p>"Given his importance, I want you to have a full team," she said. "You can pick two more shinobi."</p><p>"Sai," I suggested. Not because he had skills I needed for this, but because I owed him. We'd taken him and shaken him up and put him in danger and then abandoned him. I'd looked, carefully and lightly, over the last three months but seen neither hide nor hair of him. And it worried me.</p><p>Tsunade looked briefly surprised. "I'll see if he's available," she said, neutrally. I couldn't tell if she was happy with it or not.</p><p>I ran through the rest of my choices. Team Gai would have been an obvious pick, because they were basically designed for body guarding missions. But they were out of the village on a mission of their own right now – I knew because there had been a distinct lack of Tenten around the house and Shikamaru had been sulking.</p><p>But we needed someone with close quarters skills. Two Nara and Sai put us heavily in the midrange, tilted towards skill and not strength. It was a gap I was highly uncomfortable with.</p><p>"And Kiba Inuzuka," I decided. He was more versatile than Chouji, no matter how good his teamwork with my brother. And Akamaru nearly counted as another member besides.</p><p>We actually had a few days leeway to get ready because we'd been hired in advance. It was nice to actually have time to pack and get ready rather than be terribly rushed. Of course, the mission looked like it would be fairly long, including travel time, so that was important.</p><p>"Do you think I should take some books?" I asked idly, staring at my shelves. I hadn't read any in ages. They were getting dusty. "We might have downtime to kill."</p><p>'Mission downtime' anyway, which would probably preclude training and most usual activities.</p><p>"Have you got space?" Shikamaru called back, voice muffled from where he was trying to unearth something from his closet.</p><p>I scoffed. "Have I got space," I repeated, scoffing. And then threw half a dozen books into hammerspace. Because I could. "What a question."</p><p>Packing was so much easier when you could just take everything. Thanks, Tenten.</p><p><hr /></p><p>So I didn't expect you guys to jump on the Yoshino thing so fast. Way to spoil the foreshadowing. XP</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: ominiousguest – you're a few years off, I'm afraid.</p><p>Shadow Puppet performance art is heavily inspired by Jacksgreyson and her little Dreaming of S(omething) ficlet about the same.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 111</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The theater is so endlessly fascinating because it's so accidental. It's so much like life. ~ </em> <em> Arthur Miller</em> .</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Sai!" I called cheerfully, quickening my steps until I reached him. "I'm so glad you could come!"</p><p>'Glad' didn't quite cover it. 'Really relieved' might have been closer. He looked… okay. Not great but he wasn't dead, wasn't injured, wasn't being kept somewhere I couldn't reach him.</p><p>"The Hokage requested me for this mission," Sai said. "I am here." It wasn't entirely <em> factually correct</em> but I doubted Tsunade had bothered to say I'd made the request, either. It was probably for the best.</p><p>Kiba and Shikamaru caught up to me, looking curious. I made introductions. "I think you met at Naruto's farewell dinner?" I added, a little uncertainly.</p><p>"Oh," Kiba said, in a tone of realization. "You're <em> that guy.</em> "</p><p>Sai blinked at him.</p><p>"You helped out with that weird chameleon illusion castle thing," Kiba clarified. "Shino and Hinata told me all about it." He grinned. "Thanks for that."</p><p>I relaxed a fraction. Kiba was predisposed to be friendly, that was good. It wasn't that he wasn't friendly normally but, like Naruto, if he didn't like someone you knew about it. And that could make things awkward. "Kiba is Shino and Hinata's teammate," I explained to Sai, even if he could probably have picked that up from context. It was dubious whether that information <em> connected</em> for him, on why it meant Kiba was thankful.</p><p>"I was … following the orders of my team leader," Sai said, almost faintly puzzled. "Your gratitude is unwarranted."</p><p>"Whatever, man," Kiba said, and stepped past him towards the gate. "No wonder you get on great with Shikako, if you're as bad at accepting thanks as she is."</p><p>I would have grumbled at him but I was team leader so I really ought to be professional. I organized our departure with the gate guards and we took off, slowly heading towards Land of Rivers where we would meet the client.</p><p>We had plenty of time, so we didn't rush and maintained a smooth ground covering pace.</p><p>"Mum said you've been doing missions with her," Kiba said cheerfully as we moved. "I bet that was fun. You don't want to know what she's been saying about you."</p><p>"You should hear what she's been saying about <em> you,</em> " I retorted quickly to cover the worry that that sentence caused. What was she saying, and to who and why? "How did it go… You're housetrained, know how to follow orders and good with small animals."</p><p>Kiba stopped dead in his tracks. "<em> Mum</em> ," he whined, in a pitch perfect tone of sheer mortified child. Then he shook it off and started moving again. "Well, she says worse things about Hana. It's never going to work though, everyone is too smart to want to be related to her."</p><p>Kiba managed to keep up a conversation with me and sometimes Sai, even though Shikamaru grew tenser and snappier the further west we travelled.</p><p>I let him be until we made camp.</p><p>Truthfully, I wanted to just let it be entirely. If he wanted to have attitude, I'd let him. But this was a mission – was only the <em> start</em> of a mission – and I was team leader. If I had to mediate conflicts to make things go well, then I'd goddamn mediate.</p><p>"Do I ask," I said, dropping down to sit next to him, "or are you just going to tell me?"</p><p>Kiba and Sai might not have been far away, but it was the illusion of privacy. They weren't actively part of the conversation. Short of sending them to run a perimeter, it was the best we were going to get – and I didn't want to start the mission with those kinds of petty orders, either.</p><p>Shikamaru gave me a darkly sardonic look. "Yeah, well," he said, "the last time we came this way it didn't exactly end well, did it?"</p><p>I nodded, thoughtfully. So that was it. "Fair enough," I said. "We're keeping a watch tonight and we'll set up some alerts further out. If anything attacks, we'll have warning." And the chances of there being <em> another</em> army of pseudo-ninja running around here had to be pretty slim. Still, it wouldn't hurt any to take precautions.</p><p>Shikamaru stared at me. And then lowered his face into his hands and started to laugh. "That's not-" he managed to say. "Forget it. Just… forget it."</p><p>I stood, flustered. And maybe a little hurt. Dammit, I had listened and I had offered suggestions and I <em> hadn't</em> said 'you're being paranoid'. And he laughed<em> ?</em></p><p>Fine. I'd forget it.</p><p>"Want to draw straws for the watches?" I asked, looking over to Kiba and Sai deliberately. "We'll split them by three, and then keep rotating, so someone gets to sleep freely each night."</p><p>We got to our destination point around lunchtime the next day. It was a reasonably small town in the lower half of the country. It wasn't near enough the coast that it had been destroyed in Haido's attacks, and was still bustling and busy. Pretty, though, with a winding river through the middle of town and picturesque walkways.</p><p>We found the hotel where the client was staying. And met the team of Hidden Sand ninja that had been escorting him around Land of Wind. Technically, with the treaty in place, they could have kept on escorting him through Land of Fire and back home, but Michuri had done a full tour of the Elemental Nations – Rock and Lightning included – and that wouldn't have been so simple. Which was probably why it had almost been a relay between the villages, passing the client along, each constrained by their borders and treaties.</p><p>"How many ninja does Leaf actually have?" Kankurou asked rhetorically, as we organized the handover. "I'm starting to think you're the only ones. Every time, it's always you."</p><p>"You're just lucky," I told him. "You'd miss us if we weren't here."</p><p>He was the only one on the team I recognized and Temari wasn't there. I thought that maybe Gaara wouldn't want to send them both away at the same time, but such a high profile client would require him to send someone he trusted.</p><p>"How was the trip?" I asked.</p><p>Kankurou shrugged. "We got attacked a few times. Couldn't tell if they were aiming for him, or if it was just a target of opportunity." He made a lazy gesture at all the people that made up this group.</p><p>"There's a lot of target," I acknowledged. What did they call it, a retinue? It was nearly a small village on its own.</p><p>"Yeah," Kankurou agreed, but looked thoughtful. "Look… you notice anything missing?"</p><p>I did, in point of fact. "He didn't bring his own guards?" All these people – chefs and assistants and drivers and who knew what else… and not a single guard?</p><p>"Exactly," Kankurou agreed. "We took over from a bunch of Rock shinobi and they weren't exactly forthcoming about the situation or anything but I've been keeping my ears open. Seems like he did have guards, but they all left once they got here. Resigned and vanished."</p><p>Well. That was… interesting. "Difficult client?" I asked, because it was best to rule out the simple explanations first.</p><p>"Well, yeah," Kankurou agreed. "But not <em> that</em> difficult. He's doesn't scrimp the pay, the accommodations are good, the food is amazing and there are a lot of side benefits. You know, he hired Ayumi Hamasaki for a private show and I got to see her perform?"</p><p>I had… no idea who that was. "Sounds nice."</p><p>"It was <em> amazing,</em> " he said fervently. "But no one in their right mind walks away from a job like that. Not even if it was ten times more difficult. And every guard going at the same time?" He shook his head. "It's fishy."</p><p>I sighed. "Fantastic."</p><p>"Watch your back, okay?" he said and it, wonder of wonders, actually sounded a little concerned. Then he ruined it immediately. "There's only so many maps you can rewrite before they start calling you a natural disaster, sparky."</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him and was about to retort. Then I heard the twang of a bow, the whistling of a wooden projectile in the air. No killing intent. No warning.</p><p>I spun around, drawing a kunai from my leg pouch, hand rising to throw it.</p><p>Then I aborted the motion, re-sheathing it. The projectile was a wooden arrow with a sucker attached to the end, the bow was a toy and the attacker was a child.</p><p>I plucked the arrow out of the air and stared hard at him. I breathed out, a long controlled exhale from my nose and tried not to acknowledge how that would have ended several weeks ago before Kakashi-sensei had made a habit of sneaking up on me and forcing me to think before I reacted.</p><p>The child lowered the bow. "Hmph. Well. I guess you might be a real ninja."</p><p>"I am," I said, as mildly as I could. "And 'real ninja' don't take too kindly to being attacked."</p><p>He looked mostly puzzled, rather than admonished. "It wouldn't have done any harm."</p><p>I spun the arrow around my fingers. It was light and flimsy. No, it wouldn't have done any damage to me – but I could have to him. Nearly had.</p><p>"No weapon is a toy," I said. I coated the thin wood in chakra, sharpening it to a point over the rubber sucker. Then I threw it back to him. It embedded itself in the wall, sinking an inch deep and quivering with force.</p><p>He stared at it, then at me with wide eyes.</p><p>"This is Hikaru Tsuchi," Kankurou said in the silence. "The son of Prince Michiru." Then in an undertone he added, "you better get used to that. He does it a lot."</p><p>Great. That was… just great.</p><p>"Speaking of the prince," I said. "You need to introduce us."</p><p>It was both a way to divert the topic and a way to make us look fractionally better in the eyes of the client, if we could show we had a good working relationship and trust with his current guards. I was perfectly aware that without a Jounin-sensei here to be a visible adult presence, we looked <em> young. </em> Even if we managed to appear older than our real ages… we wouldn't look that old.</p><p>"Sure, sure," Kankurou said. "I guess I better say goodbye to the guy. Remind him to hire us again and all of that."</p><p>I motioned the rest of the team over from where they were hanging back and we followed Kankurou inside, to a very opulent entertainment room. Hikaru followed us at a distance, peering around corners like that would hide him. I tried to memorize his chakra signature, small though it was. He was both a civilian and a child so it was to be expected. If he was going to keep it up with the sneaking and attacks, I'd <em> better</em> make sure I knew it was him, always.</p><p>Inside Prince Michiru was playing cards with a group of people and, judging by the stack of game pieces in front of him, probably winning.</p><p>"Ah, Kankurou!" He exclaimed happily, catching sight of us. "Have you changed your mind about playing? I'll buy you in!"</p><p>"Thanks for the offer," Kankurou said, turning it down. "But the team from Hidden Leaf has arrived to replace us, so we'll be taking our leave soon. This is Shikako Nara, Special Jounin."</p><p>"So soon?" The prince said in dismay, dropping his cards and not even appearing to care. He turned away from the game and heaved himself out of his chair. He was… a large man, to put it kindly. "No, no, you simply must stay a little longer! We were all looking forward to another one of your wonderful puppet shows."</p><p>Kankurou hesitated. "Ah, well. Our mission is officially over," he hedged.</p><p>"Then I'll extend it!" Michiru said brightly. He waved over one of the men standing nearby, who stepped forward promptly with a clipboard at the ready. "Hisakata, please pay our Sand ninja to stay and put on another show for us."</p><p>Kankurou gave me a semi-rueful look. Obviously, he didn't want to turn it down. I could see why not; in the long term it was good business sense to keep wealthy clients happy with you and in the short term, well, it was more money. More money for not a lot of extra work, even.</p><p>"We'd be delighted for you to stay a little longer," I said softly, guessing what the concern was. If they'd been a people I trusted less, I might not have really wanted them to stay around to interfere with our mission. We were here as body guards and that often meant against other villages. "I've heard that the Hidden Sand puppet shows are really something to see."</p><p>Michiru beamed and clapped his hands together. "It's true, it's true!" he said. "The other ninja were so boring and wouldn't entertain me at all. But Kankurou has been wonderful – I never knew Bunraku could be so exciting! Even Hikaru loves to watch it." His gaze drifted over us. "You wouldn't happen to perform too?"</p><p>And really, it was just good business sense to keep wealthy clients happy with you. The entire conversation had been loaded with so many hints that I would have to have been blind to not notice them.</p><p>If we had to come up with ways to be 'entertaining', we would.</p><p>"Unfortunately not," I said, softly. "Hidden Sand's Puppet Corps is unparalleled. Though we would be honored to share some of Konoha's entertainments and I do have some skill at shadow puppets."</p><p>Kankurou laughed. "Shadow puppets," he said. "You've got some nerve. Okay, I gotta see that, sparky. You versus me, tonight. And our field of battle is <em> theatre.</em> "</p><p><em> Oh god, what was I getting myself into?</em></p><p>I nodded, solemnly. "By your leave, Michiru-sama," I said, though the prince had no objections at all. On the contrary, he looked thrilled to pieces.</p><p>We escaped outside. I was six hundred percent sure Kankurou was laughing at me. I ignored him and cleared my throat, turning to my team. "Okay, we want to scout around town and make sure it's clear and get to know the people we'll be travelling with. One person should stay here to guard the prince – and his son."</p><p>Who was still watching us, peering out behind a corner of a building. Still, it was no worse than Konohamaru, really.</p><p>We drew straws. Shikamaru ended up getting the short one and stuck on guard duty, though given that it was the easiest position that required the least movement, it was probably the one that suited him the most. He didn't appear unhappy about it.</p><p>"So, theatre," Kiba said, laugh in his voice. "How'd you talk yourself into that one?"</p><p>I neither groaned nor glared at him though the urge for both actions was there. "I'll manage," I said.</p><p>"You hate any kind of public speaking," he said. "You were the <em> tree</em> for our class play."</p><p>I did groan. "Yeah, I do," I said. "But the list of things I hate has dramatically rearranged itself in the last year. It doesn't even make the top ten anymore. I'll manage." Somehow. "It's not going to kill me."</p><p>Kiba snickered. "Alright. Let me know if you need a cute animal stage hand to distract them. He knows lots of tricks, don't you, Akamaru?"</p><p>Akamaru barked happily, head popping out from the neck of his jacket. He was getting almost too big for that now.</p><p>"You joke," I said. "But I might have to take you up on it."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Nothing actually went wrong that afternoon, despite me starting to wish it would. No matter how much I tried to keep my attitude blasé, I was getting nervous.</p><p><em> Maybe I can quit my job and go live as a hermit for the rest of my life. Hermits don't have to perform.</em></p><p>It only got worse as we dined in the hotel – and yes, the food <em> was</em> good - and Kankurou crushed my hopes that the audience would be limited to our teams and the clients by revealing that he'd managed to book the <em> town square</em> for his own performance. And I would likely be expected to go directly after him, do not pass go, do not change locations.</p><p>"You… okay with that?" Shikamaru asked me, voice low. He'd said very little about the whole thing. "Do you… want me to help?"</p><p>I gave him a weak smile. "I think it should be okay. But if we have to do it again, then it's your turn."</p><p>He snorted and leant back. "I didn't agree to any of this."</p><p>"You're a ninja," I said. "I think that's all the agreement you get."</p><p>"This isn't really part of our mission, is it?" Sai asked, possibly sounding a little bit disapproving. He'd been mostly quiet so far, so I'd been wondering when he'd have his say about it. "It seems pointless."</p><p>"Well, yes and no," I said, trying to answer him seriously. "It's not word-for-word part of our mission. But we <em> are</em> supposed to be representing Konoha to the best of our abilities. The Land of the Moon is rich, but doesn't often have dealings with ninja. It's in our best interests to make them think of us as their best choice."</p><p>He nodded. "Yes, I understand that," he said. "But isn't it… a wasteful use of jutsu?"</p><p>"Maybe," I agreed. "But I'm not going to use enough of it to exhaust myself, so it shouldn't cause problems. And it'll be like training, in a way; levels of precision and control and unique applications that I wouldn't normally strive for in combat training."</p><p>"If you don't normally strive for them, then surely they wouldn't be useful?" Sai pointed out.</p><p>I hummed. "But if you can't do them, then you'll never think of ways you could use them," I pointed out back. "If your only tool is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail. Conversely, if you have a lot of different tools… you might find new ways to solve problems."</p><p>Or something. Did that even make sense?</p><p>"Metaphors," Sai said with a sigh. He stared down at the plate of food that he had barely touched.</p><p>"My metaphors are great," I said obstinately. Although Sai really did seem to get the worst of them, apart from maybe Naruto who would have never complained about it.</p><p>After that, time started to slide away with an alarming speed. Kankurou dragged us out to the town square where a reasonable crowd was starting to form. It seemed like word had gotten around.</p><p>"Prepare to be amazed," he said, and unsealed two small puppets from a scroll. They weren't ones I had seen before – certainly not Karasu or Kuroari – and humanoid in an exaggerated and cartoonish way, painted bright and cheerful colours.</p><p>And then, with a showmasters ease, he captured the crowds attention and started the play. It was some old Wind Country favourite, about a pair of lovers that lived on opposite sides of the desert and had to travel across it to see each other, which was no easy task when you weren't ninja. And of course, it was all horribly tragic and they both died at the end.</p><p>It was good, though, in the way that well-worn favourites were always being retold. And it was clear that Kankurou was enjoying himself. Maybe, in some world where he wasn't a ninja, this was what he would have done.</p><p>Once the applause had died off, and Kankurou had had enough of talking to the crowd, he bowed out. "You guys need to welcome Shikako Nara to the stage. Let's see if she can match this, yeah?"</p><p>I grimaced and hopped up onto the stage beside him. It wasn't really a 'stage', just a raised stone lip on one side of the square, backed by a wall.</p><p>I was intensely, immediately uncomfortable. There were a lot of people here. More than it had seemed when I was part of the crowd too. And they were all staring at me. I focused my eyes on the small group of people I knew and tried to ignore the rest.</p><p>"Ah, well," I said to Kankurou, and tried to inject a bit of life into my voice. "We'll have to let the audience be the judge of that."</p><p>He bowed, mockingly. "The floor is all yours."</p><p>The sun was low now, setting, which wasn't exactly great. But I was prepared. I attached a handful of LED seals onto a string of ninja wire and pinned it to the front of the stage, curling the end of the wire underneath my foot. I channeled chakra into it, lighting them all up to shine brightly upon me.</p><p>It went straight into my eyes, but it also meant my shadow loomed large on the wall behind me. And that was the whole point.</p><p>"Thirteen years ago," I started, voice falling easily into the rhythm of a story I had heard so many times before. It was the official story, dramatic and only a little untrue. "A nine tailed fox suddenly appeared. Its tails lashed out, smashing mountains and sending tidal waves crashing to the shore."</p><p>Behind me, my shadow split off. No longer the shape of a human, but of nine waving tails.</p><p>I wove the story onwards, shadow moving and taking shape behind me. I couldn't see past the glare of the lights to see the reactions of the crowd, merely focused on keeping my voice even and steady. I displayed the destruction, the terror, the battle.</p><p>Carefully, carefully, I focused on a single tendril of shadow and used it to plant a small touch blast on the wall in the midst of the diorama.</p><p>But it was too much, trying to hold two jutsu, tell a story <em> and</em> focus well enough to plant a seal. My LED snuffed out, dropping the stage into darkness.</p><p><em> Shit</em> . I burnt with humiliation at the unintended failure. I set off the seal, the tiny blast of fire roaring out and arcing up over the heads of the crowd. I used the seconds of darkness to plant a few more seals for use later, and channeled chakra back through the ninja wire to reignite my stage lights.</p><p>"But one shinobi came forward to face the nine tailed fox without fear," I went on. "And this was our Fourth Hokage. He arrived in a flash of light-" I set off one of my flash seals as I spoke, chasing my shadows off the wall before reforming them into a new shape. "- and all the ninja of the village knew that they were saved."</p><p>I drew the rest of it out, though this was the bit of the story that often differed – and was the most untrue. I said nothing of Naruto, or of Jinchuriki, though I did say that he had summoned the Shinigami.</p><p>"And it reached out it's great hand-" I said, voice sinking ominously, and for the first time of the performance switched from using two dimensional shadows to three; a giant, dark hand reaching out from the wall.</p><p>There were screams of startled surprise.</p><p>"And dragged them both down into <em> death.</em> "</p><p>I picked myself up in the shadow hand, closing those dark ominous fingers around my torso … and then pulled it backwards to slam into the wall. A quick replacement jutsu with a small rock saw me harmlessly standing amid the crowd again and the stage blank and empty.</p><p>There were more screams.</p><p>They faded into a hushed silence, tense and expectant.</p><p><em> Right.</em> I had… no actual plans for after that. Shows over. Go home.</p><p>Then Kankurou looked at me sideways and started to applaud. The sound of his clapping caught on, and the rest of the crowd started to cheer too.</p><p>"How <em> wonderful!</em> " Michiru gushed. "I've never seen anything like that!"</p><p>Kankurou hopped back up on the stage, avoiding going through my line of seals but otherwise looking unbothered by them. "Well," he said to the crowd, in a tone halfway between wry and conspiratorial. "I guess we might need a vote after all."</p><p>They cheered, responding easily to his direction.</p><p>"Get back up here, Nara," Kankurou directed.</p><p>I slunk out of my team, reluctantly. "I gracefully concede," I called, hopefully. "And congratulate you on your victory."</p><p>But I found myself on stage again, standing awkwardly next to Kankurou as the audience cheered. It was every bit as uncomfortable and awkward as their silent attention had been. Still, I gave it as much graceful acceptance as I could because actions had consequences and I had talked myself into this situation and now I had to deal with it.</p><p>Kankurou did let me escape eventually, and I pocketed the seals to leave the stage dark and empty. "It was an alright show for a novice," he said, damming with faint praise. "Though you'd have never got away with using cheap tricks like that in front of a ninja audience."</p><p>I shrugged. "That's me," I said, the faint echoes of something old making my lips quirk into a smile. "Cheap tricks and witty one liners."</p><p>He laughed. "I wouldn't have said you were witty."</p><p>"Get lost," I said, rolling my eyes at him. "You're supposed to be halfway back to Hidden Sand by now."</p><p>"Too right we are," he agreed, adjusting the straps holding Karasu to his back and shifting the weight of it. "Catch you next time, sparky."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Yes, I got totally sidetracked with this. Kankurou showed up and it was all over. Sorry, not sorry.</p><p>Uh, that said. I don't want to be the ranty author. But I feel that this is something that needs saying because I know you guys are all really keen for the next update to happen as fast as it can.</p><p>So I'm going to say, there are a couple of comments that are <em> incredibly</em> demotivating when I receive them in reviews, and tend to mean I don't work on DOS for a few days, even when it's something that I'm really excited to write – like this chapter.</p><p>So, while I appreciate everyone who takes the time to review, please know that if all you really want to do is say things like 'I hate the movies/anime/fillers', 'where's the plot' or 'please skip all your carefully planned content and just write shippuden' then you're really only shooting yourself in the foot. Because not only will I <em> not</em> , it will also take me longer to get through the stuff I do have planned and get there.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of the Moon Arc: Chapter 112</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 112</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> It is always wise to look ahead, but difficult to look further than you can see. ~ </em> <em> Winston Churchill</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The thing about travelling with groups this size, was that they went <em> slow.</em> Things had to be packed. There were wagons to load and carriages to hitch and horses to tend to. People had to be organized and directed. Even accounting for the fact that they were civilians, we didn't get far at all. Only to the southern coastline of the Land of Fire, where they'd hired out a beach house that opened out onto a deserted stretch of sand.</p><p>We were briefly very busy securing the area and checking the safety of the place, but nothing turned up. The sun went down and we lit a bonfire on the beach, a local band had apparently been hired to provide entertainment, and Michiru appeared to be thrilled with everything.</p><p>"I feel so much more at home on the beach," he said, stretching. "Wind Country was very nice, of course, especially the Garden and healing springs, but there's nothing quite like a beach. The Land of the Moon has the loveliest sand – it's so fine and soft – and even in winter the water is warm enough to swim in."</p><p>Land of Fire might have been a temperate country but it was still too cold to go swimming. Well. To go swimming for pleasure. Unless you were a masochist.</p><p>"Sounds nice," I said.</p><p>Prince Michiru nodded. "You'll see when we get there," he said sagely. "People come from all over to visit. There's nothing like them!"</p><p>I made vague noises of agreement, and hoped it sounded like I cared about beaches.</p><p>I settled myself in next to the bonfire and wasn't even really that surprised when Sai sidled up to me. So far, he'd either been near my side or gone completely. I'd have been more worried about the latter option if I thought there was actually anything around here for him to be doing.</p><p>"You are being followed," Sai told me.</p><p>"It's just Hikaru," I said, although I suspected Sai was perfectly capable of working that out himself and knew as much – he just… didn't have the experience to distinguish between childish antics and actual threat. I had told them all what Kankurou had passed along, but everyone had noticed the lack of guards on their own and it put us a little bit on edge. "So don't worry, it's not dangerous. I think he's just bored." The kid mostly seemed to be left to himself, so he probably just thought we were the most interesting things around. It would probably wear off in a few days. "Unless you'd like to entertain him?"</p><p>Sai gave me the blankest of blank looks. "I am not suited to the task."</p><p>I tried not to laugh at him. "Oh, I'm sure you could manage. Your jutsu seem very theatrical."</p><p>"I don't know any stories to tell," he said, as if it were an obvious thing.</p><p>"That's just sad," I said, lightly, to cover the fact that it really was. It really, really was. I couldn't even stretch my mind to imagine a world like that, where I didn't have stories. Even now, when I didn't read or write as much as I had before… they were still part of me. "We're definitely going to fix that."</p><p>I had books and I pulled a few of them out of hammerspace to drop into his hands. Though looking at them now, there was nothing I would have picked if I'd known I'd have to lend them to Sai. I hadn't even read most of them myself – which was kind of why I'd brought them along.</p><p>I clicked my tongue in annoyance. "Maybe this place has a bookstore. There's so many things you need to read."</p><p>We were on a mission, but it wouldn't be impossible for someone to duck away for a short period of time while the prince was occupied with his daily entertainment.</p><p>"Are you making Sai do school work?" Kiba asked, appearing behind me and slinging an arm around my neck, trying to pull me sideways. "For shame, Shikako. Not cool."</p><p>I unwound myself out of his grip. "Sai wanted something to read," I explained, which was a kinder way of putting it.</p><p>"The Sage of Zen Mountain," Kiba read off the top book, craning his neck to see it. "That even sounds horrifically boring. You should have come to me, man. I have, like, six volumes of Samurai Genji."</p><p>"Samurai Genji is <em> awful</em> ," I said, appalled. "You can't make him read that."</p><p>"It's great," he countered. "The fight scenes are absolutely hilarious."</p><p>"Hilariously bad," I said. "The artist doesn't even know how to draw a sword."</p><p>Kiba snickered. "I know. It's fantastic," he assured Sai. "You will laugh so much."</p><p>"Draw?" Sai repeated, and looked down at the books I had given him as if that might give him an answer. They didn't. "It's an illustrated book? I thought those were only for small children."</p><p>"It's a manga," Kiba said, impatiently. "About a Samurai. Named Genji."</p><p>"I don't know what that means," Sai admitted.</p><p>Kiba paused. "It's … a manga. What kind of rock have you been living under, if you've never read a manga?" He shook his head. "You've been deprived. Just wait here. I'll go and get them."</p><p>He took off in a burst of speed that was completely and utterly unnecessary. Shikamaru caught my eye from where he was loitering and raised an eyebrow, asking if anything was up. I rolled my eyes, which I hoped conveyed the utter lack of situation.</p><p>"Anyway," I said, "these are probably too long to make an act out of. You'd want something simple and short with only a couple of characters to move around, I think."</p><p>For shadows, I needed things with unique shapes – I'd picked the Kyuubi tale mostly because of the tails, they were easy to shape and dramatic to wave around behind me, and I thought next time I might do the tale of Icarus with wings of feathers – but Sai had a different method.</p><p><em> Red Riding Hood?</em> I wondered. It had a wolf, and he mostly made animal shapes. <em> Something with a dragon?</em></p><p>I paused. It was a little bit mean. But also entirely hilarious. "Okay, I've got one for you to draw," I decided. "Let me tell you the story of Sleeping Beauty."</p><p><hr /></p><p>We did stop by the bookshop the next day. I brought an entirely unreasonable number of them, including two copies of Tale of the Gutsy Ninja off the discount bargain table. I snapped them up immediately.</p><p>"I never managed to find this one!" I told Sai delighted. "Jiraiya-sama wrote it."</p><p>That actually appeared to grab his interest. Most likely because of the small chance that there was <em> actual ninja content </em> in it, but I wasn't going to be picky. Actually, I wondered how many people in Konoha had read Icha Icha at least once under the same idea. And how many of them worked in Intel and actually <em> had to.</em> I knew that they'd probably have to be cleared before publication in case they had anything sensitive in them, because that was just how ninja worked.</p><p>I gave one copy to him and kept the other for myself. Or maybe so I could give it to Naruto later, I wasn't sure.</p><p>I didn't ignore my responsibilities to read it – we were on a mission here and I took that seriously – but I did tear through it as soon as I had time. The first time, quickly, then again, knowing the path of the story and taking the time to turn each word over, look at the depth and the themes and the scale of it all.</p><p>I could see why this wasn't a famous book. It was simply written, but about something that couldn't be reduced to an easy plot arc. <em> What is war?</em> It asked. <em> Why do we fight? How do we stop it? What is peace?</em></p><p>And it never answered those questions, because it couldn't. Because there were no answers, or the world wouldn't be the place it was.</p><p>'I'll keep looking,' Naruto said, at the end of the book. Dissatisfying, when you expected a book to have an ending. But ultimately true.</p><p>The group continued to move on at a leisurely pace, stopping at nearly every town along our route or at any site of particular interest. I hadn't realized there were so many touristy things to do in Fire Country but we seemed to be experiencing them all now.</p><p>It took us nearly three weeks to make it to the capitol and with no incidents worth mentioning from a security point of view.</p><p>The capitol was almost a shock after the quiet of the countryside. Prince Michiru had to make an obligatory diplomatic visit to the Daimyo, of course, which meant stopping at the palace, which meant that we had to interact with his guards. And that was, naturally, a serious and complicated endeavor.</p><p>The Daimyo's security was headed by the Twelve Ninja Guardians, who were –supposedly – contracted solely to him and not to a village, probably to provide a safety net in case of Daimyo-Village conflict. In practice, some of them were Konoha ninja on long term deployment, like Asuma-sensei had been, simply because there weren't that many non-village ninja anymore. There were a handful of clans that remained around Fire Country, and they were the ones who made up the rest of the group.</p><p>Given that we were legitimate Konoha ninja on a legitimate mission for a client from an allied nation (or at least, non-enemy) it really shouldn't have been as stressful as it was.</p><p>The Daimyo himself was at least a familiar figure, and his wife more so. He even appeared to recognize me back, which was slightly awkward. But I supposed he had been at the exams, after all. "Oh yes, Shikako Nara," he said, fluttering with his fan. "Quite spectacular. Quite spectacular. I understand I should offer congratulations on another promotion."</p><p>I murmured polite thanks, bowing, and settled into seiza with the other guards near the side of the room for the tea ceremony. It was terribly dull and they didn't talk about anything important but it went on and on and on. For once, Prince Michiru seemed to have drawn a cloak of seriousness over himself, and I supposed there was a difference between being informal with your own people and informal with another Daimyo.</p><p><em> I should have made one of the others do this part</em> , I thought trying to remember what my original decision had been. Probably something like 'I'm the mission leader so I should probably be the one to go'. Sadly, it was still probably true.</p><p>Once it was all over though, it was like a switch was flicked and Michiru turned immediately back into his normal entertainment seeking self.</p><p>"The real reason I wanted to come to the capitol," he confided to me. "Is that Yukie Fujikaze's latest movie has its opening night here. I love her movies."</p><p>"Oh, the Princess Fuun movie," I said, slightly startled. It had been months, but I guessed that was normal – there was all that editing and post production stuff to do even if they hadn't had to keep filming to make up for how everything had gone horribly, horribly wrong.</p><p>"You've seen them?" Michiru asked, with all the enthusiasm of a fan finding another fan.</p><p>"I was sort of involved in it?" I said, awkwardly, because wow, how did one even go about describing this. "My team was hired to be her bodyguards during the filming."</p><p>"You absolutely have to tell me all about it," he said, stars in his eyes.</p><p>I humored him as much as I could, but it wasn't like I was great at telling stories about things I'd seen. They never seemed quite so interesting when put into words. And, well, the whole 'murdered family' thing seemed a bit heavy to be used as a funny anecdote.</p><p>The movie premier was a big event. There were red carpets and mingling, both of which I wanted no part in. I felt both underdressed and out of place in my ninja gear, compared to the way everyone else was done up.</p><p>There were even paparazzi with cameras of various types, flashbulbs going off again and again like a nauseating disco. I was trying to ignore them and pay attention at the same time because that kind of distraction was a pretty good example of an opportunity.</p><p>But all that happened was someone calling my name.</p><p>Hidero, the actor that had played Shishimaru in the movie, dropped an arm around my shoulder and carefully posed us for the cameras. "The director said you weren't coming," he said cheerfully. "Is the rest of your team with you? I have a feeling that Sasuke is going to be quite popular – that kid shows up well on camera."</p><p>"I'm sure he'd be delighted to hear that," I said with a small smile. Somewhere scattered in the crowd, Kiba gave a hacking cough that said he had definitely heard it. "But no, they're not here. I'm actually here as the bodyguard for Prince Michiru – I wasn't aware the movie was showing until we got here."</p><p>I stepped away to introduce them, but it was unnecessary. Michiru shook his hand with enthusiasm, and gave a genial endorsement of his acting skills from the last movie.</p><p>"Thank you, thank you," Hidero said with all the composure of someone who actually did this kind of thing for a living. "I hope you do enjoy the movie. It's been a real blast making them and I'm a little disappointed they're over, to be honest. But there'll be more movies in the future, I can guarantee that!"</p><p>Hikaru seemed to be getting really bored by the whole thing and I kept an extra eye on him in case that meant he was about to run off and / or start shooting things with his toy bow. But we managed to make it inside to the actual theater before too much longer and got to the part of the evening where the movie actually started to play.</p><p>It started off fine. Fuun and her team having finished their quest from the last movie and deciding to go home to reclaim the land that they had to leave at the start. Then they were ambushed by sorcerer Mao, in a scene that I remembered filming on the iceberg.</p><p>Annnd that was approximately where it became terrible. I sank down in my seat. I hadn't expected them to entirely cut us out, but I also hadn't expected there to actually be that much usable footage, given everything.</p><p><em> Sloppy</em> , I winced as the camera jerked back to me-on-screen launched a lightning jutsu that fizzled into the air. What terrible technique. And I looked terrible. Why had they allowed this.</p><p>The camera jerked around again, cutting rapidly between the different portions of the fight, and the music was a heart pounding rattle of drums. I felt tense, even though it was all already over, even though I knew how it had all gone in real life. I chanced a glance at the others, who looked entranced by the whole thing.</p><p>On screen, Fuun's fight went badly and it segued into the Shishimaru death scene that they'd filmed on the boat. Fuun wept over the body and the music swelled into something terribly sad and there were reaction shots of all of us that had to be cribbed from various times of the journey.</p><p>On-screen-Shikako leant on the railings, looking sad instead of seasick. "Near, far, wherever you are," she sang, music cutting off until all that was left was her voice.</p><p>I sank <em> even lower</em> into my chair, mortified. They'd filmed that? Really?</p><p>"I believe that the heart does go on."</p><p>And then came the flashbacks. Apparently I was Shishimaru's little sister, left behind when he went to join the princess on her quest, who joined up with Mysterious Mentor Kakashi to fight for the country in our own way. And we'd found Fuun and her team just in time to watch the beloved big brother die. How very tragic.</p><p>There were sniffles in the theater. I was too embarrassed by actually being in the movie myself to get into the storyline. If I could have left and never actually watched the movie, I would have.</p><p>This was <em> actually worse</em> than having to do shadow puppets. At least I didn't have to see myself, then.</p><p>But the movie trucked on. Clever editing put Mao and Dotou working together. The attack on the train, the invasion of the castle, the fight on the ice and the transformation of the country into spring… and then the mirrors cleared and shone and the hologram of Koyuki's childhood started to play. It looked good on the screen, and I was pretty sure no one was going to believe that it wasn't CGI.</p><p>"And now we will have spring," Fuun said, camera zooming into a close up on her face, and laughed softly.</p><p>The movie cut to her coronation.</p><p>I shifted, rolling my shoulders to release the tension in them, now that I was no longer going to be embarrassing myself on screen. We had to sit through the end credits, and wasn't that odd, seeing my own name up there. Not something I'd ever thought would happen.</p><p>"You're a movie star," Hikaru said the second it was over, half in awe, half accusing. We stood and started to move towards the exit to go wherever people were mingling for the reception. (Afterparty? Whatever it was called.) It was slow going, with the theater as full as it was. "You didn't say that."</p><p>I cleared my throat. "That's a bit of an exaggeration." Why, oh why, did it have to be this movie? Anything else and I would have been fine.</p><p>"Our very own movie star," Kiba echoed, leaning over the seats with a very wolfish grin. "Shikako Nara, you have been keeping secrets."</p><p>It was much easier to be annoyed at Kiba than it was to be annoyed at clients. "Oh yes, very secret," I said, voice sharp with sarcasm. "It's only recorded and about to be broadcast on giant screens all over the country."</p><p>"It seems unwise," Sai offered. "To allow your abilities to have been recorded like that."</p><p>"It's all out of date by now," I said, because he wasn't entirely wrong. "And it's not like any of it was secret after the Chunin Exams anyway."</p><p>Shikamaru wasn't saying anything. I glanced at him, but he was slouching with his hands in his pockets, still staring at the blank screen. And saying nothing.</p><p>I really wanted him to say something, but I didn't even know what. What <em> was</em> there to say about it? It was just a movie. It didn't matter.</p><p>"Hikaru," I said, changing topics to something that wasn't me focused. "Did you want to stay or go back to the hotel? One of us can take you, if you want."</p><p>He frowned, and looked around indecisively. "I'll stay."</p><p>The reception was a whirlwind of way too many people, which was terrible from a security point of view and also because all of them seemed to assume I was there as, well, one of the actors. Given that my face had just been on the big screen, I got recognized.</p><p>I hoped the rest of the team was making up for the fact I kept getting sucked into conversations with people.</p><p>"My dear!" Director Makino said, beaming at me. He shook my hand furiously. "I'm delighted you're here! I sent a message to Hidden Leaf but they told me none of you were available."</p><p>"I am currently here as Prince Michiru's bodyguard," I said, gesturing. "He's a huge fan of your movies."</p><p>"Yes, yes," the Director agreed. "It was marvelous, wasn't it? It was a dream, to film a movie about a princess using a real princess. And with real ninja, too! That might be my next great work. The only way to top the Unlucky Princess finale; a movie about ninja made with real ninja." His hands arced through the air, like he was tracing a rainbow.</p><p>I was about to smile blandly, politely, and assure him it would be great. But then I paused.</p><p>"I know a ninja story that would look amazing on the big screen," I said, and twisted my wrist to bring my copy of Tale of the Gutsy Ninja out of hammerspace. "This was written by the author of the Icha Icha series, before he went on to writing romance. It's a <em> very</em> important story in certain shinobi circles."</p><p>I pressed it into his hands, not letting him wave it off. This probably wouldn't work. It would probably go nowhere. I was just leaping on the barest hint of an opening, with no idea how it would play out. If it would ever play out.</p><p>"It might be very dangerous, though," I said, as if an afterthought. "Land of Rain – the place it's set – is a war zone and there were so many complications with the last movie that you probably wouldn't want to be attacked again, would you?"</p><p>The Director had never had his priorities straight. He'd zoomed straight into danger, thinking only of how it would look on the screen. He would probably like it <em> more</em> if the fighting was real.</p><p>I squashed the tiny bug of guilt that wanted to alight on me for getting people involved in this. People who had absolutely no chance of defending themselves if things went wrong. It was just that if this gave us even the barest possible excuse to get closer to Hidden Rain, to Pein, then I would take it. It probably wasn't even going to work, even if I'd suggested it. It would take forever, even if something happened with it. I was just… setting up an option. A possibility. A wild notion. That was all.</p><p>The Directors eyes gleamed. "Dangerous, did you say?"</p><p>I gave a hollow laugh and hoped it didn't sound too fake. "Oh yes. But I'm told you have some ninja friends. I'm sure they could help you out."</p><p>I was an awful, awful person. But Pein could never be allowed to come to Konoha. Not now.</p><p>"It sounds very interesting," Michiru said, rubbing his hands together, and missing most of the by play. "I would love to watch such a movie. Please let me know when you begin searching for investors. I think I would like to be involved!"</p><p><em> Oh, that's something</em> , I thought. A wild idea was one thing. A wild idea that had the potential to have money thrown at it was something else. Something else entirely.</p><p>"I will certainly consider it," the Director said with enthusiasm, clutching the book like it was going to be stolen from him. "Yes, yes, I can see it now. My magnum opus…"</p><p>We let him mutter on. My heart was fluttering with misplaced adrenaline, nerves from doing nothing.</p><p>Nothing. Something. <em> Maybe</em> something, sometime down the line.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next day, we headed to the outskirts of the city, instead of to the docks. Michiru left most of his entourage behind, taking only a single carriage to carry him and his son.</p><p>"I thought we were departing today?" I asked as casually as I could.</p><p>Michiru brought what looked to be an entire flower shop and attempted to stuff it into the carriage. "Oh yes," he said, nervous. "Well. There's someone that I wanted to visit first!"</p><p>The place we ended up going was not quite what I expected. It was a house by the sea, sure, but it wasn't anywhere near the kinds of places we'd been staying on the trip. Not run down, exactly, but lived in. The type of house that normal people lived in, not princes.</p><p>"It's been so long, Amayo!" Michiru greeted enthusiastically, carrying an armload of flowers towards the house. "My honey! I missed you!"</p><p>The woman stared at him, mostly just confused. Then she saw Hikaru.</p><p>"Hikaru?" She asked, stepping past the prince like he wasn't even there. Like he didn't matter. "Hikaru is that you? You've grown so much."</p><p>She ducked down to embrace him.</p><p>I tried not to focus too hard on the awkward family reunion that was apparently going on. Security. That's what we were here for. Watching for threats. There could be all kinds of threats happening around us. It was very important to be on the lookout for them. Very important. It should take all my attention.</p><p>But the conversation was really hard to miss.</p><p>"-That's why we'd like you to come home, Amayo!" Michiru entreated. "I'm lonely and Hikaru is too!"</p><p>"I told you," Amayo said shortly. "I don't want to be with you anymore. If Hikaru is lonely, then he can come and live with me." She seemed compassionate enough to her son but had no patience to spare for Michiru.</p><p>"Why do you hate me so much?" Michiru asked plaintively. "I gave you whatever you wanted. Wasn't it enough?"</p><p>Amayo sighed, like someone who had tried to explain the same point a hundred times. "You missed the most important thing."</p><p>The prince's face lit up. "I did? Tell me and you can have it," he promised. "What was it? A mansion? A summer house? I'll give you any jewel, treasure or the Country of the Moon itself."</p><p>"No!" Amayo said furiously. "You haven't changed at all! You have no idea what's really important."</p><p>I winced and shared an awkward 'why do we have to be listening to this' look with Shikamaru. We were on exactly the same wavelength here.</p><p>Michiru trudged back to the carriage an absolute picture of dejection. Hikaru looked equally heartbroken, but for slightly different reasons. He kept looking back at the house –at his mother.</p><p><em> Poor kid.</em></p><p>"Hey, Hikaru," I said, because I might not be able to actually <em> help</em> but I could at least be distracting. "Want to practice your shooting?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Merry Christmas and / or Happy Holidays, everyone!</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of the Moon Arc: Chapter 113</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Happy New Year!</p><p>Also – there's a bunch of you I really want to reply to, but FFNet is doing something weird with reviews at the moment and they're not showing up for several days. Sorry about that – I will try to get back to you, but if I don't… blame the site. :)</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 113</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Hey young blood</p><p>Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?</em></p><p><em> ~ Phoenix; Fall Out Boy</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The ship that took us to the Land of the Moon was larger and flasher than the one we'd taken to the Land of Snow, but it was still a boat, so I was glad when we were able to disembark.</p><p>"Home sweet home," Michiru called joyfully, spreading his arms like he could hug the whole country. He was starting to look tired now, like a man who had been on a very long trip who was so close to being home, however enjoyable that trip had been.</p><p>We left the majority of the group and items – of which there were a lot because the prince had spent his entire trip just <em> buying stuff</em> – to be unloaded at the docks and only took a single carriage to transport the prince back to the palace.</p><p>But as we drew up the road towards the palace, I gestured my team into a firmer formation around the carriage.</p><p>"Sense something?" Kiba asked, taking point.</p><p>"Not yet," I said with a slight frown. "But if anything is going to happen, this will be the last chance."</p><p>We'd been alert the whole trip, waiting for whatever shoe to fall and nothing had. Making it back home would either mean he was <em> safe</em> or we would find out what was really going on.</p><p>Best case scenario, nothing was going on. We'd deliver Michiru home, mission complete, turn around and go home. Worst case scenario… well. There were a lot of different worst case scenarios, actually.</p><p>There were guards on the gates to the grounds and the driver hailed them to admit us. They conferred for a moment, and I sensed a runner get sent off towards the castle before the gates swung open.</p><p><em> Not unusual</em> , I thought because there were plenty of legitimate reasons to alert people to returning royalty. A welcoming committee would need to be assembled, food readied, preparations made to retrieve things from the docks – perfectly normal concerns.</p><p>But I still made sure I knew exactly where the guards along the fence were.</p><p>I hesitated for a beat, then swung up onto the step beside the carriage door. "Are there an unusual number of guards around?" I asked through the window, quietly. I had nothing to compare it to, since I didn't know Land of the Moon, but it wasn't a small number.</p><p>Michiru blinked owlishly at me, then looked around in confusion. "Oh, I suppose," he said which wasn't exactly a solid confirmation. "I hope nothing has gone wrong."</p><p>I made a vague hum and stepped down off the moving carriage, moving back out to a wide guard position. I had no doubt the rest of the team had heard that exchange and they could draw their own conclusions.</p><p>The grounds were pretty and well maintained – a driveway that circled up to the palace, a large water feature on prominent display – and the carriage drew to a halt in front of the oversized front doors. Above the doors there was an open balcony with stairs on either side.</p><p>The passengers got out of the carriage. "Eh? No one has come to welcome us?" Michiru asked, sounding disappointed.</p><p>There was the sound of echoed footsteps, the rhythmic sounds of a score of people marching in unison, and a squad of guards appeared on the second floor, marching down the stairs to surround us. There were maybe forty of them, armed with shields and spears or swords.</p><p>We moved into a tight formation around Michiru and Hikaru.</p><p>"Hold," I said, quietly, trusting my team to pick up on it. I wanted to know what was going on. These were only civilians and we weren't in trouble yet. We could afford to wait and see how this played out.</p><p>"Shabadaba?" Michiru called, looking upwards as a man appeared on the balcony above us and doing an excellent job of ignoring the armed soldiers around us. "What's going on, is something wrong?" There was definite unease in his voice, but he was trying to seem confident.</p><p>Irrelevantly, I wondered who on earth named their child Shabadaba. <em> Shaba daba doo?</em> You were honestly just asking for them to turn into a cartoon villain at that point, weren't you?</p><p>"Michiru-dono," Shabadaba said with a barely concealed sneer. "I see you've returned from your trip. And Hikaru-dono, too."</p><p>And that didn't sound intentionally ominous at all, I thought dryly. Like someone had arranged for him not to return, perhaps?</p><p>Michiru put a hand on his sons shoulder and pulled him close. "Yes, of course," he said with fake cheer, eyes moving back and forth across the man above us. "Where's Papa?" he asked with the same determined pep. "Is he not here?"</p><p>"The King," Shabadaba said, "is dead. I am now the ruler of this country. So that makes you… quite unnecessary."</p><p>The soldiers around us tensed, hands tightening around weapons, leather creaking and metal clanking.</p><p>"Kill them," Shabadaba ordered.</p><p>The soldiers didn't move.</p><p>Not that they didn't want to, of course. But they'd launched an ambush on a group that included <em> two</em> Nara. It was doomed to fail right from the very start. And that balcony did cast a very nice shadow down on us.</p><p>"Drop your weapons," I ordered. I opened my hands and they did. On the other side of the group, Shikamaru mirrored me which was the real purpose of the statement. The guards didn't have a choice.</p><p>Still, the looks on their faces as they followed my orders. Like the words had power.</p><p>Sai leapt up, springing from the top of the carriage to the ledge of the balcony in one easy move. His sword was half drawn as he crouched.</p><p>"Taicho," he said diffidently. "Shall I take care of this?"</p><p>Shabadaba stepped back, the look on his face that of a man who had just made a very large mistake. But not one who regretted it. "Ishidate!" he shouted.</p><p>And-</p><p>"Three ninja incoming!" I said loudly, chakra sense picking up on the signals inside of the palace. They were moving smoothly but not with a great deal of urgency, like someone whose employer was in trouble. Maybe they didn't particularly like him, either.</p><p>Shikamaru and I exchanged looks and pulled out ninja wire, tying it to shuriken to loop it around the guards in an easy restraint. It wasn't particularly binding, but it was fast and we wanted them out of the way if there was going to be real fighting.</p><p>"I thought you said you had it handled," the incoming ninja drawled, stepping out onto the balcony. He had a shock of orange spikey hair and a white vest over a blue outfit. The other two ninja with him – a girl and an even larger man – were dressed the same.</p><p>Shabadaba bristled, right down to his ridiculous moustache. "Just kill them," he said in irritation.</p><p>Ishidate – that was probably his name – sighed theatrically.</p><p>Then <em> moved. </em> Fast.</p><p>Sai bent backwards and just barely avoided the first swipe. Ishidate's fist passed over his chest, close enough to ruffle his clothes. Then it stopped and reversed, a hammer blow coming down at an angle to crack his ribcage.</p><p>Sai retreated in a burst of body flicker, vanishing as the stone he had been standing on exploded into fragments and dust, returning to the ground.</p><p>The other two ninja were stayed where they were, hanging back, but that clearly didn't count them out of the game.</p><p>I considered our options. Not just if we could manage this fight, but if we should. Obviously we needed to keep Michiru safe from them – that was our mission – but it might not have been our best option to engage these with him right here. We had no idea what their skills were and it would take so little for them to get past us to kill him.</p><p>"Watch the damage!" Shabadaba said sharply. "I can't have you wrecking my palace as soon as I take over. These things cost money to repair, you know."</p><p>"We'd all prefer things were settled without damage," I offered, projecting my voice up to them. It was a bit of a long shot, but I would much prefer it if we <em> didn't</em> get into serious fights while trying to protect people. "Surely this can be settled diplomatically like civilized people?"</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>The girl rolled her eyes. "I'll take care of it," she said, and flicked a kunai down towards us.</p><p>Kiba batted it away from the carriage but the smoke bomb attached to it exploded in mid-air and he froze. "<em> Poison!</em> " he shouted. "Don't breathe it in!"</p><p>And that decided me. None of this fight was in our favour and none of us had any particular skill at dealing with poison. "Retreat," I ordered. "Get back in the carriage." I gave Michiru a shove towards the vehicle and he scrambled for the door.</p><p>The rest of us scattered as far from the smoke as we could without getting too far from our client. It was hard to tell if it made any difference without knowing what kind of poison it was. Not breathing was going to be hard if we had to fight. Oxygen was a necessity.</p><p>The carriage started to move, the horses well trained even though they were starting to dance with fear. But the gates ahead were closed and the guards posted around the fence line were drawing inwards, pulled by the fighting.</p><p>"Sai, take out the guards," I ordered. "Kiba, get the gates."</p><p>Which left Shika and I to stall these ninja so we could get away. Yay.</p><p>I flicked a kunai with exploding tag up at the balcony – more at Shabadaba than the ninja, because two could play at this game. Ishidate knocked it out of the way, back into the air, but seemed more irritated than worried.</p><p>"Well, Karenbana," he said and crossed his arms. "Are you going to take care of it? Or shall I do it?"</p><p>Karenbana glowered at him. I caught the brief flicker of light on metal as she palmed a kunai, then she vanished in a burst of speed.</p><p>I twisted, tracking her by chakra not sight, to avoid the attack.</p><p>Her kunai scored a line of fire across my cheek.</p><p><em> Wha- I dodged that!</em></p><p>But there was no time to voice the thought. She was too fast. I couldn't react in time, even if I could sense her changes in direction. Had no time to start a jutsu to catch her when I was so busy trying to dodge.</p><p>Then Shikamaru's shadow raced around me, encircling me and providing a barrier of safety she couldn't cross without being caught.</p><p>I staggered, and ran a thumb across the cut on my cheek. "The poison," I said, more a warning to Shika that because I needed to realise it out loud. Also because I needed to stall for a moment – my hand dropped to my vest, flicking open one of the front pockets. "It dulls our reactions. Senses as well."</p><p>Karenbana smirked but didn't reply.</p><p>Behind us, Kiba was spinning into a Tunneling Fang, bursting the gates open to let the carriage out. And I could feel the fluttering of Sai's ink animals subduing the guards.</p><p><em> Time to leave.</em></p><p>"Shadow Stitching Jutsu!" I called, dropping four small finger sized scrolls down onto the tendrils. They snapped out, extending rapidly, not at Karenbana but past her. Two reached back to the walls of the castle and two only slammed into the ground only steps in front of us.</p><p>"Sealing Style; Four Corner Barrier Seal!"</p><p>Blue light snapped into reality, translucent walls filling the air between the seals. The two rear seals were far back enough that it curved up over the balcony, locking all three of our enemies inside. Usually, you set barriers up to keep things <em> out</em> but they worked just as well to keep things in – all you had to change was to put the seal tags outside of it.</p><p>Karenbana slammed into it, just a few seconds too slow to escape. Her face was filled with rage.</p><p>My one seal barrier had failed utterly in the Chunin Exams. I'd had to take a step back, go back to the original barriers and start again. This wasn't even one of my creations – but I was now really glad I had brought it along.</p><p>Shikamaru grabbed my arm. "How long will it hold?" he asked as we spun and chased after the carriage.</p><p>"Hour, maybe," I said. "Unless they have some way to break it."</p><p>Which was a possibility you could never discount. I was hoping it would hold, that it would give us time to get away and get our client somewhere safe – give us time to regroup and shake off the effects of this poison.</p><p>I kept an eye out behind us as we caught up to the carriage careening back along the streets. Nothing came chasing after us and nothing attacked, so they hadn't broken it yet.</p><p>The horses were slowing down, unable to keep the pace, breathing heavily and sweating. It was going to be faster to leave them behind soon, and travel on foot, but that raised the question of where we were going to go. Getting away was one thing. Now we had to work out what we were doing next.</p><p>At the front of the group Akamaru barked. "Yeah, guards ahead," Kiba agreed, translating for us. "Not ninja, though."</p><p>The guards were dressed the same as those from the palace, but they weren't barring the road. On the contrary, they were waving, like they were trying to hail us down. "Michiru-dono! Michiru-dono, this way, quickly!"</p><p>"Captain Korega?" Michiru said, unwinding just a little and looking out the window. He kept Hikaru pressed tightly to his chest. He was pale and shaking but that was almost to be expected after what had just happened.</p><p>"You know him?" I asked, hopping up onto the footwell. That wasn't exactly a vote of confidence, given the whole coup situation but… it would be good if there were locals on our side.</p><p>"Yes, he was the captain of the guard," Michiru said. "Do you think…?"</p><p>I bit my lip and looked over my shoulder. "Go with them," I decided. But I exchanged a look with my team that said 'keep an eye open, just in case' as well.</p><p>The carriage turned down a side road, winding away until it was off the main streets. There were more guards there, waiting, but they had horses with them.</p><p>"We thought you were dead," Korega said, sounding relieved. "And Hikaru-dono, too. It wasn't until we received word from the docks that you had returned that we began to hope. And even then we thought we would be too late… But this isn't the place to talk. My men will take care of the carriage and dissuade the pursuers."</p><p>He helped the prince out of the carriage and onto one of the horses but hesitated when he turned to us.</p><p>"These are my bodyguards," Michiru said. "Shinobi from the Village Hidden in the Leaves. You are staying, aren't you?" he asked anxiously.</p><p>"We are," I said, reassuringly. "Our mission was to return you home safely. That hasn't happened yet."</p><p>"That is fortunate," Korega said, though he did look a little dubious after examining us. "There are rumors that Shabadaba has hired ninja himself."</p><p>"It's true," Shikamaru said dryly.</p><p>Korega and his guards lead us all out of the city, into the forested area that made up the outer edge of the islands crescent shape. We did our best to obscure the trail we left, but if Shabadaba's ninja had any forest skills they would probably be able to find us.</p><p>As we fled I ran a diagnostic jutsu on myself, trying to find the poison. But poisons were not my specialty – they were nothing so obvious as bleeding wounds or broken bones – and there was little I could do. It might have broken down inside me already, if it were such a fast acting thing.</p><p>There was a surprise waiting for us, when we reached the little cave that they were using as a campsite. I sent Shikamaru and Kiba off to quickly set up perimeters and to scout around and Sai hovered quietly behind me.</p><p>"Papa," Michiru called, dashing inside to the figure that was laid out on a futon. "What's wrong, papa?"</p><p>So the king wasn't dead, after all. That… might be helpful.</p><p>"The king is very ill," Korega said quietly, as the form on the futon failed to stir at all, no matter how much Michiru begged. Hikaru hovered like a quite shadow, hand curled in his father's shirt.</p><p>"What happened?" I asked. I could fill in the general picture, of course, but this was someone who likely knew the details.</p><p>Korega nodded, like he understood what I was asking. "The King and the First Minister have always had their differences," he said. "But it became much more apparently recently. The King began to implement a new social security program – helping those in this country who do not have the means to help themselves. It was very taxing on the treasury and many of the wealthy did not support it. The King thought that they would come around, once it became clear that the program was working and that the country was not suffering for it. But it seemed that they only cared about the bottom line."</p><p><em> Ah, money.</em> So many things came back to the money.</p><p>"We advised the King to be careful but it seems even we weren't prepared for how far Shabadaba was willing to go," Korega admitted. "He staged a coup and though we got away, the King is… well. I don't know how to describe it. You should see for yourself."</p><p>He waved me inside. I left Sai standing sentry and ducked into the cave, my eyesight adjusting to the shadowy darkness.</p><p>"He won't wake up," Michiru said to me tearfully. "Can you help him?"</p><p>"I can try," I offered and ran through a diagnostic jutsu.</p><p>And then paused. The data came back, jumbled and vague.</p><p>I reached out and turned the covers down. Michiru gasped in horror. The Kings arm and chest had been turned to stone. I touched it, gingerly. It was crumbly and rough but hard. Stone.</p><p>"We don't know how it happened," Korega said. "Or how to fix it. We think one of the Ministers ninja must have done it but…" he trailed off.</p><p>"I haven't seen anything like it before, either," I admitted, running through a diagnostic jutsu again. It still came back a jumble of useless information but I thought, maybe, I sensed natural energy in the stone portions of his limbs.</p><p><em> Natural energy </em> does<em> turn things to stone.</em></p><p>That gave me exactly zero idea of how to fix anything, though. And the fact was, the petrification was causing a lot of other problems with his body and systems. One lung was partially petrified, and there were veins and arteries and nerves…</p><p>I rocked back on my heels, painfully aware that he didn't have long to survive. Maybe Tsunade could have saved him, right now, but I was no Tsunade.</p><p>"I can wake him up," I offered, tentatively. "But, I'm sorry, I can't heal him."</p><p>Korega closed his eyes, but the admission didn't seem to surprise him any. It was grief, quickly wrangled and barred behind gates of duty.</p><p>"Wake him up," he agreed. "Let him see that his son has returned."</p><p>I changed the humming of chakra in my hands, coaxing the old man to consciousness. His breathing was heavy and labored, but his eyes slowly cracked open and there was intelligence there.</p><p>"Grandfather?" Hikaru asked, timidly. "Grandfather, are you hurt?"</p><p>The old man drew in a rattling breath. "Ah, Hikaru. How nice to see you again." He smiled and it seemed real, even if it was tight with pain. "And Michiru. You've both come home."</p><p>"Yes, papa," Michiru said, clutching his hand. "We're here now."</p><p>"And how," the King started, then paused for breath. He looked up, past his son to the captain of the guard. "And how is the country doing?"</p><p>Korega shook his head. "The coup goes on," he admitted.</p><p>The King sighed, a long mournful thing. "I see," he said. And clearly he did – he understood exactly what was going on here. "Tell me, Michiru. What do you think of this country of ours?"</p><p>Michiru blinked in confusion, but gamely tried to answer. "It's a wonderful place," he said. "Full of value and beauty."</p><p>"Yes," the King agreed tiredly. "But so much more than that too. I dreamed of building a country that was full of smiles and happiness, of hope and dreams. But recently I looked down on my people and found that those things were missing. We didn't become happy with only prosperity. I tried to fix that but it was too late."</p><p>He fell silent, nearly gasping for air.</p><p>Michiru looked bewildered. "Papa, I don't understand."</p><p>"It will be your job now," the King said. "Michiru. I am sorry to leave this to you. I know you are not ready. But won't you please make this country a place where people can be happy?"</p><p>His eyes were fluttering shut.</p><p>"What? Papa!" Michiru shook him, gently at first then harder. "Papa, wake up." He turned to me. "Please, wake him up again!" There were tears gathering in his eyes and starting to stream down his face.</p><p>I sat back. "I'm sorry," I said quietly.</p><p>Hikaru started to cry, loud and messy. "Grandfather!"</p><p>I slipped backwards, out of the cave and unnoticeably as I could. My team was waiting outside, but I had no doubt they'd heard. "The King is dead," I said. "Long live the King."</p><p>Politically, our mission was even more important now. Our client was <em> the King.</em> We couldn't afford for him to get hurt.</p><p>"Do you have more barrier seals?" Shikamaru asked. "We can surround the camp."</p><p>"Only one set," I admitted. "And they wouldn't last long enough." I stared out into the darkness and tried to narrow down our options. There was a lot hanging in the balance and I wished I wasn't the leader here – I didn't want to be the one making the call. "How do you feel about fighting those ninja?"</p><p>"The poison is going to be a problem," Kiba said bluntly. "We barely got any of it and it still made you stumble. If we breathe more of it, we're done for."</p><p>"We don't know what the others can do, either," Shikamaru pointed out. "Or how strong they are. It's too risky to engage them."</p><p>"We can't expect to escape them," Sai pointed out, the voice of pessimism. "Or evade them for long. The island is not large and they will expect us to flee."</p><p>I grimaced, because they all had good points. We could call for backup but we'd still have to hold out until backup reached us. We could run but we'd have to get away.</p><p>"We have a boat off shore," Korega said, ducking out of the cave. His voice was quiet. "We couldn't move the King but…" he swallowed. "If we get Michiru-dono and Hikaru-dono to it then we can take them to safety. There are allied countries we can ask for help."</p><p>I nodded slowly but- "They'll expect us to flee," I echoed Sai's words. I couldn't see any way around having to fight again. Which meant we were going to need a way to deal with the poison.</p><p>I tapped my fingers together.</p><p>"Got an idea?" Shikamaru asked, raising an eyebrow at me.</p><p>"For the poison," I elaborated. "I think I have some medical masks. They won't keep the poison out, of course. But I could put a seal on them…"</p><p>"To filter it?" He asked.</p><p>"No." I frowned. "I'm not sure anyway. And there's not really a lot of time to experiment. But if I just make a <em> storage seal</em> and put a whole lot of air in it…" I wave a hand around, gesturing at all the very clean, very nice non-poison air we happened to be breathing. "And then just let it release constantly while we were wearing it…"</p><p>A primitive hack job of an oxygen tank, basically. But it would keep us breathing fresh air, which would be the thing that mattered.</p><p>No one seemed to have an objection to that.</p><p>"Right," I went on. "That's the poison issue, then. But Sai is right –they'll be expecting us to leave. They're probably watching the beaches. Can your ink creations hold a transformation? Can they look like people?"</p><p>If Naruto had been here, shadow clones would have been perfect. Otherwise we'd have to use transformation ourselves – and have an obvious lack of ninja – or illusion clones which were insubstantial.</p><p>Sai blinked. "I can make Ink Clones, yes," he confirmed.</p><p>"Good," I said. "We'll make a diversion then. Take a couple of ink clones down to the beach and stall the ninja when they attack us. Korega will wait with the real Michiru behind the barrier seals and then make a run for the boat once the fighting has started."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The sun had set and left only the light of the moon to guide us by the time we were ready – by the time I'd made our masks, by the time we'd relocated closer to the shore line and found somewhere safe to put up the barrier seals to keep Michiru and Hikaru protected. They had to be close enough to know when it was safe to go, yet far enough away to remain undetected.</p><p>Then we stepped out onto the beach. All the hair on the back of my neck stood on end, as the feeling of walking into a trap intensified.</p><p>It wasn't the closest stretch to the palace. We weren't <em> trying</em> to look obvious. But if they were paying attention, it certainly wouldn't take them long to get here.</p><p>I fixed my mask over my mouth. The air was like a steady wind blowing past, slightly chilled. Half an hour worth, maybe, if I'd calculated it right. Shikamaru and Sai were wearing theirs but Kiba had his slung around his neck.</p><p>"I can't smell anything," he said. "I'll put it on when I have to."</p><p>"Your call," I said. He knew himself best. I'd just given everyone the best tools I could.</p><p>We moved slowly across the sand, the ink clones mimicking the heavy slow tread of the prince- of the king.</p><p>We almost made it to the water's edge, to the small rowboats waiting for us, when I sensed them coming. I gave the signal.</p><p>Sai drew an ink bird and took to the sky, getting distance for an extra layer of safety. Kiba snapped his mask into place, and Akamaru transformed into his Human Beast Clone form and was given one too. I dropped my resistance seals and enhanced my muscles with chakra.</p><p>We were as prepared as we were going to get when a barrage of kunai flew out of the trees towards us.</p><p>"Earth Style; Earth Wall!" I barked, slapping my hands down on the sand. A dune of sand surged higher, catching the kunai, though to call it a 'wall' would have been charitable.</p><p>Sand scattered in the wind as the kunai exploded and there were plumes of worryingly coloured smoke. It wasn't close to us but I was acutely conscious of the fact that we were dealing with unknown poison.</p><p>"You are going to <em> pay</em> ," Karenbana hissed, voice low and furious as the three of them landed on the beach. "I'm going to enjoy killing you."</p><p>There were times for attempting to de-escalate situations. And there were times when those times were passed. "You wanna come down here and say that to my face?" I asked. "Or are you too scared?"</p><p>Her face contorted in anger and she vanished in a swirl of flower petals that twisted like a tornado.</p><p>Unimpressed, I shattered the genjutsu with a twist of my chakra.</p><p>And then Kiba and Akamaru slammed into the group, throwing swathes of sand into the air with their Fang Over Fang.</p><p>I darted forward, using the sand as cover to launch my own attack. The sound of my lightsaber cut through the air, giving the barest of warnings before I could stab Ishidate in the back. He twisted out of the way, retaliating with surprising speed. But I had speed now, too. And light. And shadows.</p><p>The third ninja – Kongo – was equally as fast but even stronger. He caught me with a blow that sent me tumbling across the sand. But then I was back on my feet and back in the fight. It was a fast paced whirlwind of techniques – between Shikamaru and I using launching shadows and Kiba's Inuzuka taijutsu and Sai providing tactical support from above – we weren't winning but we were definitely stalling.</p><p>And then Kiba stumbled. Or not Kiba; Akamaru. He turned back, whimpering, and staggered sideways on the sand.</p><p>"Akamaru?" Kiba yelped, alarmed. He turned.</p><p>"Did you think," Karenbana mocked. "That just because you didn't breathe it, you were safe?"</p><p>I understood our mistake all at once. <em> Contact poison. Fuck.</em> Akamaru was the smallest of us, had succumbed first, and it was a warning that we needed to get out. Now.</p><p>Kongo leapt for Kiba. I felt the world slow as I saw it – the killing blow that would land. Kiba wouldn't, couldn't, react in time. I couldn't react in time.</p><p>And then Shikamaru's shadow was there, punching through his shoulder and pinning him in the air, holding him aloft like a particularly ugly prize.</p><p>Shikamaru panted and sunk to one knee, one hand outstretched to direct his jutsu.</p><p>Ishidate grabbed it. The black glove on his hand flared to life suddenly, ugly crimson light filling the air. It felt like it <em> dragged</em> , like it had a gravity all of its own, pulling chakra into it.</p><p>There was a sound, almost like the cracking of ice.</p><p>Grey stone spread out from under his hand. It climbed down, covering wrist and hand, and up past the elbow.</p><p>"Shikamaru!" I yelled, eyes going wide with horror. Karenbana's kunai lodged itself in my back, totally irrelevant compared to what I could see.</p><p>Ishidate twisted his hand.</p><p>And Shikamaru's</p><p>arm</p><p>shattered.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of the Moon Arc: Chapter 114</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 114</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> There is no passion so contagious as that of fear. ~ </em> <em> Michel de Montaigne</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Time didn't freeze – it only felt like it did; that one horrifying moment stretching out longer and longer like an infinity caught in a second. Like an instant crystalized, sharp and clear and still.</p><p>Everything felt unreal. Felt like I was watching something happen very, very far away.</p><p>The pieces of crumbling stone fell slowly towards the sand. I could see each and every one of them, the size and shape of them, like they were interlocking pieces of a puzzle that had unexpectedly come apart.</p><p>The pieces of-</p><p>The pieces of Shikamaru's <em> arm</em> fell slowly towards the sand.</p><p>And I discovered I could move after all.</p><p>I needed to do something. I needed to do something big, something that would turn the tables, something that would defend us, would get rid of our enemies and without wild area of effect damage. Something that wouldn't hurt us further. I didn't have many options.</p><p>Everything snapped back into alignment. My heart was thundering in my ears. My breath rasped. There was stabbing pain in my back. The world was tilting and swimming; my equilibrium upset by the poison.</p><p><em> Shit, shit, I have to do something now!</em></p><p>Who could I trust to defend us if I couldn't trust myself?</p><p>My hands flickered through handseals. "Summoning Jutsu; Heijomaru!" I screamed, like volume could make up for skill and surety. I forced chakra into the jutsu, trying to frame the situation in my mind, trying to convey what I needed.</p><p>It wasn't easy. Naruto had always made this part seem easy. Naruto hadn't even made this seem like <em> a step</em> , like it was so simple and obvious that he'd never needed it explained. I still didn't have it down – but Heijomaru <em> always</em> answered first and I was counting on that.</p><p>And he did.</p><p>Heijomaru surged out of the ground beneath my hands, sand spilling off of him like running water. He was armoured like the very first time I'd seen him, antlers glinting with metal points, demonic mask down over his face and sides protected with layered plates. I clung to them, fingers going numb, seating myself on his back.</p><p>A blur of ink raced past us, Sai's ink animals targeting the enemy behind us. The one I hadn't <em> forgotten</em> about but had ignored anyway. She wasn't important, right now.</p><p>"There!" I gasped, leaning forward.</p><p>And Heijomaru <em> exploded</em> into action. I felt his muscles bunch, the way his hooves dug into the sand, then the translation of potential into action. Into motion.</p><p>Shikamaru's shadow stitching jutsu – the one holding Kongo aloft into the air – was faltering, the slow decay of a jutsu that no one was maintaining.</p><p>Heijomaru hit the enemy without slowing, his spiked antlers dipping to pick him out of the air, metal coated spikes puncturing through the body like sharp knives through so much meat. The muscles of his neck bunched under my hands from the weight of a person, and then he <em> shook</em> , side to side, spikes driving in, tearing and then throwing Kongo free.</p><p>Blood splattered my face like awful rain.</p><p>Two more giant steps carried us over Shikamaru, and we slid to a stop, four legs bracketing him like a defensive, bristling fortress. Ishidate retreated, moving <em> away</em> from my brother, out of the path of our charge.</p><p>Barely seconds, and the tide of the battle had changed. Twice.</p><p>Behind us, Kiba raced through handseals. "Inuzuka style: Keukegen!" he spat.</p><p>Actually spat. A dozen small hairball like things flicked through the air, hitting the sand and growing to the size of a soccerball. They scuttled forward, a barrier between us and the two remaining enemies.</p><p>And to the side, the two ink clones of Michiru and Hikaru that Sai had so carefully been keeping out of the battle, the decoys of the people we were supposed to be protecting, turned tail and fled into the forest.</p><p>Ishidate and Karenbana took the bait. They blurred after them, leaving us wounded and damaged on the beach, abandoning the fight for what seemed to be their real objective.</p><p>Sai's remaining ink animals streamed after them, a long white and black line of pursuit.</p><p>I slid, sideways, off of my summons. My legs buckled when they hit ground and dropped me onto the sand, but I didn't need to stand.</p><p>"Shika!"</p><p>He was clammy pale, eyes wide in shock, and shaking almost violently. His right hand clamped over the stump of his left, fragments of stone peaking out from between his fingers.</p><p><em> It's real.</em></p><p>I swallowed. Then scrambled, frantically and uncoordinated, at the neck of clothes, pulling down the zip on my vest and shirt to free the necklace I wore beneath. I yanked it loose, snapping the cord.</p><p><em> Please, pleaseplease-</em></p><p>Gelel had healed me. It had healed Fugai, when we had fought her. Surely, surely it could heal Shikamaru.</p><p>I pressed the stone against him, but it wouldn't go. Not like the easy way it sank into my flesh, like it wanted to be there. I tried channeling chakra to it, but it still wouldn't. It wanted to be <em> me.</em></p><p><em> No. No. Come on. Please.</em></p><p>"Shika," my voice cracked. "Channel some chakra into the stone. Try… try to use it."</p><p>His eyes darted to me, hazy, like he wasn't quite processing right. "What- what is that?"</p><p>"Just try!" I snapped, voice tight with fear and panic. <em> It wasn't working</em> . Why. Why was it not working?</p><p>Shikamaru tried. His hand – <em> his</em> <em> only hand</em> – clasped around mine, chakra flaring and sliding through.</p><p>And it did nothing.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>It passed through the stone like it was nothing but cold rock, nothing but a lifeless hunk of crystal.</p><p>Like it was on a different frequency all together.</p><p>'Inert', Tsunade had called it. They'd run all kinds of test on it, before it had ever been given back to me. They'd found nothing worth mentioning. I'd never heard it sing, not like I had with the Gelel stones. And the Gelel was <em> gone</em> now, dispersed into the air and ground and world again, just a part of everything.</p><p>This stone had been pulled out of my eight gate. Out of my heart. Formed when the spirit of a god passed through me at the point of my death.</p><p>It wasn't made of Gelel.</p><p>It was <em> me.</em></p><p><em> But it should still be able to heal Shikamaru</em> , I thought wildly. <em> I want it to.</em> I pressed it forward, again and again, trying and trying to sink it into him the way the book had described. <em> We're twins. We're the same. It </em> <em> <strong> should.</strong> </em></p><p>I was panting, breath coming in short, terrified gasps. "It's not- It's not working!" I stammered.</p><p>I couldn't fix it. My stone could fix it.</p><p>"We have to go!" Kiba barked, interrupting me. He had scooped Akamaru's small still form up and into his jacket. "We have to get out of the poison. Now!"</p><p>I jerked up, thoughts scattering.</p><p>He was right. He was right.</p><p>My stone wasn't working.</p><p><em> What fucking good are you?</em> I thought at it, viciously, hurling it away. It bounced on the sand, forlorn. <em> Useless.</em></p><p>"Heijomaru. Can you- can you-" I couldn't get the words out, formulate what I wanted to ask properly.</p><p>But he understood, or knew, or guess, anyway. He moved to the side and knelt down, bringing himself low so I could sling Shikamaru onto his back.</p><p>I turned back, one last minute desperate idea making me draw a scroll and scribble a sloppy storage seal onto it, sealing a square chunk of beach and stone into it, hopefully collecting all the lost pieces of- of arm. If I could find some way to undo the transformation…</p><p>"Shikako!" Kiba snapped, again, leaning over my deer and pulling me onto it. My muscles were all jelly. I couldn't tell if it was from the poison or adrenaline. The three of us cling to each other, trying to keep steady and balanced. Sai was still in the air above us, keeping watch, staying out of reach of the poison.</p><p>Heijomaru stood and moved, long loping strides eating up the open shoreline. He carried us away from the battle ground, away from the lingering poison and danger. Sai swooped ahead, leading us back towards where we'd left the real prince, safely out of the fight.</p><p>"Is- Is Akamaru…?" I asked, falteringly.</p><p>"Dunno," Kiba said tersely.</p><p><em> Fuck.</em></p><p>Everything had gone wrong.</p><p>Sai swooped down, dismissed his ink bird and landed neatly on the ground. Ahead of us, Korega's guards were only just starting to load the prince onto a small rowboat to transport them out to the ship they had waiting out at sea.</p><p>Our fight had been so <em> fast.</em> We'd been trying to stall them, to buy time. But it had been so fast…</p><p>"What is it?" Korega asked, hand on his sword and eyes scanning the beach behind us. "Are they coming?"</p><p>"They are chasing the decoys," Sai said bluntly. "We should move quickly."</p><p>I slid awkwardly off of Heijomaru and helped Shikamaru down. My legs held, this time. The poison faded quickly, maybe? Or had it just been shock and horror? Heijomaru bowed his head and I managed a stilted thanks and dismissal, allowing him to vanish into chakra smoke and return to the summon realm.</p><p>I helped Shikamaru into the boat. He didn't look improved. He looked worse, really. There was a grey pallor to his skin.</p><p>I didn't know what to do.</p><p>Michiru gasped. "Your arm!" he said, alarmed. He stood suddenly and the boat tipped and rocked, unsettled, until he sat again.</p><p>"Same as the king," Korega said, grimly. "That stone…"</p><p>I nodded. The king had- fuck- the king had died of this. I fumbled with my med kit, nearly spilling everything into the boat. "Painkillers," I said. It had to hurt. Painkillers would help.</p><p>I was so out of my depth. I didn't even <em> have</em> <em> any fucking medical training</em> -</p><p>My breathing was coming too fast. Too fast. I tried to choke it down, to something that wasn't hyperventilation. Wasn't panic.</p><p>I needed to do something to <em> fix this.</em> To make it okay.</p><p>Kiba climbed into the boat, unzipping his coat to free Akamaru. The puppy whined and twitched. Something in his face relaxed at the obvious signs of life.</p><p>"The glove," I said. My thoughts were too scrambled. I needed to think. I pressed my fingers over my eyes, like the pressure would help. "The glove that Ishidate had. That's what caused… it. If we had that. We might. We might be able to find a way to reverse it. It's a technique. There should be… There should be a way to…"</p><p>"Are you <em> crazy?</em> " Kiba asked in disbelief. "We can't go after them! We need to get away. That was the whole plan. We create a distraction, then we run. We barely managed that! You think we could handle a second round? Akamaru's down. Shikamaru's down. You're injured. Me and Sai are exhausted! We need to <em> go.</em> "</p><p>"You're injured?" Shikamaru croaked, looking up. The painkillers had returned a certain amount of colour to his face, but his eyes were glassy. Kiba was right. Shikamaru wasn't going to be fighting anyone.</p><p>"I'm fine," I said, dismissively.</p><p>"You have a kunai in your back!" Kiba barked. "Our mission is to get the prince to safety, not to fight those assholes. We're wasting time. Get in the boat."</p><p>I grit my teeth. He was right. It burned.</p><p>Sai was staring back down the beach. An ink mouse was skittering over the sand, moving swiftly and surely. He ducked down to retrieve something from it. "What was this?" he asked, holding up my necklace. "You tried to use this before to heal him. What does it do?"</p><p>"Apparently nothing," I said, bitterly. It had done fuckall to heal Shikamaru. It was useless.</p><p>Or.</p><p>My hand gently closed around it. It felt like an idea, like committing to a plan.</p><p>"I'm going after Ishidate," I said.</p><p>"The fuck," Kiba said, disbelievingly. "Are you even <em> listening</em> ? We. Can't. Fight. Anymore."</p><p>"Are you questioning the orders of your team leader?" Sai asked, with a frown. He looked tense and unhappy. "You should trust your commanding officer."</p><p>"Don't fucking start," Kiba said, darkly. "This is not about trust. If it were about trust, I would have said 'no' when she told me to take my Genin team up against a Jinchuriki. I didn't. This is about her <em> being wrong.</em> Team Leader or not – she's wrong."</p><p>"I don't care!" I snapped. "Go! Get out of here!"</p><p>I turned away.</p><p>"Shikako!" Shikamaru called, desperately. He lurched for me, rising out of his seat, fingers clawing through the air. He stumbled and my insides twisted, wanting to catch him.</p><p>Sai hesitated, then moved after me.</p><p>But Kiba had been right about this too, hadn't he? Sai was exhausted. He'd been throwing out ink creation after creation and I'd never thought to question how much energy each one took. Even if he was better off than the others… they would need him if things went wrong.</p><p>"Stay with the boat," I snapped at him. "That's an <em> order.</em> "</p><p>His eyes widened in surprise but he dropped back.</p><p>I vanished into the forest and headed for the castle.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The castle walls were crawling with guards.</p><p>I breathed quietly, steadily, and made myself focus on the task at hand. I needed to get in there. I needed to get the gauntlet. I needed to find out if there was a way to reverse the transformation.</p><p><em> In and out. In and out.</em> Distractions melted away. My worries were put aside, at least for now. Out of sight, out of mind. All that mattered was the fight ahead. I was injured. I was alone and outnumbered. They were stronger than me. Faster than me. They'd already kicked our asses twice.</p><p><em> They are in so much trouble.</em></p><p>The corner of my mouth lifted in a small smirk.</p><p>Too flippant to be completely true, of course, but it was nice to think so. It helped.</p><p>I'd taken a moment on the trip here to pull the knife from my back and patch it as best I could for a spot I couldn't reach, and to re-tie the necklace around my neck. I was as prepared as I was going to get.</p><p>"Stealth or not stealth," I murmured to myself, considering the wall and the people I could sense beyond it. The guards weren't ninja, and I knew exactly where the two shinobi I wanted were. I could get past everyone else if I tried hard enough, probably, but it would be difficult. I'd risk a lot if I was seen and it would take time and energy.</p><p>I nodded. "Both. Both is good."</p><p>I pulled my chakra in tight and invisible, and used all the tricks Kakashi-sensei had taught me to ghost up to the exterior wall. I travelled a stretch of it, one hand outstretched to brush against it and leave ink marks behind as I moved.</p><p>I circled around, found a perch in the trees with a good view over the wall and pulled out a stack of flashbangs. I linked them together with a cascade seal and a stretch of ninja wire, and bundled the whole thing into a ball.</p><p>Down below, the scene was peaceful. The guards were alert and prepared, but not prepared enough.</p><p>I drew a line of shadow sight across my eyes, used chakra to muffle my hearing and set off my touch blasts. The outer wall exploded into shrapnel, the guards sending up an alarm and spilling out into the night air in preparation for an attack.</p><p><em> Wait for it…</em></p><p>Chakra blazed as one of the ninja dropped down from the palace balcony to the ground – it was Karenbana, out for blood.</p><p><em> Perfect.</em></p><p>I lobbed the ball of tags over the fence, towards her, and set it off.</p><p>I couldn't see it, from behind the safety of shadow sight, and the blasts were muffled thrums of more vibration than sound, but I could sure as hell see the way that the guards staggered and stumbled, trying to shield their eyes, dropping weapons, mouths gaping and screaming. I feel the pulses of the tags going off, one after the other, providing a constant barrage of light and noise.</p><p><em> Disco inferno. </em></p><p>Karenbana was on the ground. Flashbangs wouldn't keep a ninja down for long, but this was the opening I needed.</p><p>I moved away from it, further around side of the castle where I eased my way over the wall. There were less guards here now – they weren't all gone, of course, that would have been bad management, but less. It was easy enough to spot a clear path and make a run for the castle. A body flicker let me clear the distance in less than a heartbeat, and the hardest part of that was doing the jutsu without the accompanying flare of chakra.</p><p>I scaled the wall of the palace and shimmied one of the top windows open to get inside.</p><p><em> Piece of cake.</em></p><p>I strode through the halls. I could have created a path, used jutsu to burst my ways through the walls to get where I was going, but the door would work just as well. This gave me time to plant ink as I went, just in case, circling the room where Ishidate was holed up. There were two spots of Sai's chakra that had to be the ink clones and a handful of civilians.</p><p>Hah, I thought. They hadn't even realized that the clones were <em> clones</em> yet.</p><p>I'd thought that deception would have barely lasted the fight, let alone for hours afterwards. Maybe they just didn't care.</p><p>There were two guards on the door and I didn't even hesitate, knocking them out and stepping over their unconscious bodies on my way.</p><p>Then I kicked the door in.</p><p>It felt <em> really satisfying.</em></p><p>Everyone turned to look at me. I walked in, head held high, steps even, until I was right in the middle of the room. The two clones, bundled on the floor. The minister, sitting on an elaborate throne with an assistant behind him. Ishidate, leaning against the far wall, shielded from the flashbangs – no, the flashbangs had run out, they were only flares now – going on outside.</p><p>"You," Ishidate said, with only a fraction of surprise, "really are an idiot, aren't you?" I could read his lips, but I loosened the chakra around my ears enough to hear him. Part of this involved talking, and if I was really, really lucky it would only involve talking.</p><p>I didn't expect to be that lucky. I wasn't sure I wanted to be.</p><p>"No more than you," I said, levelly. "You really shouldn't have hurt my brother."</p><p>He laughed, spreading his hands out. "So this is your big plan? Walk straight in here and challenge me to a fight? You couldn't win when there were four of you."</p><p>"Well," I said, with a flat smile that had nothing to do with amusement. "First I was going to ask how you reverse the stone transformation."</p><p>"This old thing?" Ishidate said, extending one arm and firing up the glove. He admired it. I felt the air shiver, the way it drew in the natural energy around it. The lines on the glove formed something that almost looked like an eye. "You know, I don't feel like telling you."</p><p>"Too bad," I said. "That would have been the easy way."</p><p>I crossed my arms.</p><p>Across the room, Ishidate did the same.</p><p>I'd had a stupid plan, yes. But not <em> that</em> stupid. My Shadow Sight kept the flares from hurting me, but that didn't mean they weren't there at all – strobing bright lights did great things for shadows. I'd primed it full of chakra before I'd stepped into the room, and woven it over the ceiling between the hanging chandeliers unnoticed.</p><p><em> Watch what the right hand is doing, not the left. Watch me, standing here bold and unprepared, not my shadow. </em></p><p>I wasn't sure he'd even known that I used shadow jutsu too – the darkness of the beach hadn't made it a great choice and the initial confrontation could just as easily have been attributed to Shikamaru.</p><p>Either way, I didn't care.</p><p>Ishidate's eyes went wide as his glove pressed against his own arm, the strange cracking noise filling the air as it transformed.</p><p>And then it reversed, undoing itself, and returning to smooth flesh and blood.</p><p>"Ah," I said, lifting my hand before the reversal was complete, leaving his hand made of stone. "You <em> can</em> undo it."</p><p>Then I made a fist and slammed it down, a hammerblow to the back of my other hand. It hurt, but not <em> nearly</em> as much as it hurt him.</p><p>His hand shattered.</p><p>Just like Shikamaru's.</p><p>The Minister gave a shrill scream. Both of us ignored it. As long as he didn't try and attack, I didn't care what he did. I just. Did not care.</p><p>"But can you fix it <em> now?</em> " I wondered out loud, eyes locked onto my enemy. Because this was the critical part. This was the part that mattered.</p><p>Could he fix it now.</p><p>Could I fix-</p><p>Ishidate's gauntlet hummed with energy.</p><p>I dropped and rolled to the side. The floor I had been standing on erupted into a messy pile of spikes. And kept erupting, following me as I moved. Ishidate was moving with me, but it clearly wasn't enough to distract him from causing it. I ran him into a table, into the wall, trying to dodge and dive and take him out at the same time.</p><p>It didn't work.</p><p>"Explode!" I commanded. The wall behind him burst inwards, huge chunks of stone pelting through the room. Dust hazed the air. The Minister and attendants vanished from sight, screaming.</p><p>But that just gave Ishidate more ammunition, apparently. The loose rocks moved through the air, unnaturally, flinging themselves at me. Targeting me.</p><p>I let go of the Shadow Possession and used a replacement jutsu, landing behind him. I lit my lightsaber, raising it high for a swing. My chakra hummed, circulating through the Gelel stone around my neck.</p><p>He twisted, faster than me, gauntlet ringing with energy –</p><p>- And it passed harmlessly through my chest, like grabbing smoke. Like grabbing shadow.</p><p>I pinned him in place and brought down my sword, sheering his arm off at the shoulder. The stink of burning flesh filled the room.</p><p><em> Now it's a real lightsaber</em> , I thought, almost mockingly. <em> It's cut an arm off and everything.</em></p><p>Ishidate stumbled backwards, collapsing to the ground, face white with horror. The rocks fell to the ground, under control of gravity once more, his control over them completely gone.</p><p>I pulled the disembodied arm out of my chest. Spun it over my hands and vanished it into hammerspace. A risk, if it had seals that would react to being in a storage seal, but better than trying to hang onto it during fighting.</p><p>"Thanks," I said, and this time it was definitely mocking. "That'll come in handy."</p><p>Outside, Karenbana seemed to have shaken off the effects of multiple flashbangs to the face. Which was a shame, but I'd had more time than expected, given the fight that had happened and the sheer amount of destruction that we'd packed into it.</p><p>Well, I guess that was the nice thing about working alone. You didn't have to worry about causing friendly fire.</p><p>I turned, slightly, towards the balcony so that when Karenbana hurtled up it I was looking straight at her.</p><p>She looked awful. Her eyes were squinting and her face was smeared with tears. Her wig had come loose, slightly cooked across her forehead. But she looked furious. "I will kill you," she rasped. "You are going to pay for that."</p><p>"I'm sure you said that before," I said, an unpleasant smirk kicking at my mouth.</p><p>And then I focused my chakra through my Gelel stone and dissolved, losing human shape totally and becoming part of the shadows on the floor. Unnoticeable.</p><p>It was a strange feeling, to be bodiless and formless. Uncomfortable. I could see, but it was limited. Hearing was easier.</p><p>Karenbana swore. "Sh-she's gone-ne," she said, the sound echoing to me as the sound reached different shadows at different times, slightly delayed. "I-I'm going to-to… <em> Ishidate!</em> "</p><p>I felt the vibrations as she ran towards him, even though her footsteps were silent.</p><p>"Karen," Ishidate said, voice low and tight with pain. "You have to leave."</p><p>I focused my attention in, trying to stop the annoying echo. I needed to listen to what they were saying. This was the important part. This was why I was here.</p><p>"She took the gauntlet," he said. "But she's gone. This is your chance to run, Karen. Before they come back for the prince."</p><p>"She took more than the bloody gauntlet," Karenbana snarled. "I'll go after her. I'll get it back."</p><p>"And then what?" Ishidate snapped back. "If you haven't noticed, I don't have any <em> hands.</em> " He sounded like he was verging on hysterical. "What do you think we'd do then? Kongo's <em> dead.</em> I'm next to useless. You think you can do the work of three of us all alone?"</p><p>That didn't sound like they knew any way to fix it. Didn't sound like they had a plan.</p><p>I didn't have teeth to grind together, but the feeling remained the same. Frustration. Irritation. The creeping, dawning horror that this was reality, now. There was no way to undo it. No magical fix-it button.</p><p>"I'll get the gauntlet back," Karenbana insisted. "Your arm. There's supposed to be some kind of wandering medical ninja on the mainland. We'll find her and then. And then."</p><p>"Don't," he said. "Don't risk it. If they kill you too-" he cut himself off, with a pained gasp. "You can still make it out of this. Get off the island. I can hold the royals hostage a bit longer. Give you time to escape."</p><p>"You aren't making some kind of bullshit last stand," Karenbana said furiously. "Not here. Not like this."</p><p>They didn't have a way to fix it. They didn't know how to undo the damage they had done. Not even with the gauntlet. They <em> didn't know.</em></p><p><em> Maybe Tsunade</em> , I thought desperately. I had the gauntlet now. It could undo the petrification. Maybe Tsunade could put the pieces back together. Maybe she had some other solution. Something that would make this okay.</p><p>But I thought about how many pieces there had been, how tiny and crumbled and, deep in my heart, and doubted it. Even Tsunade had limits.</p><p>Footsteps vibrated against the floor. Karenbana, standing and leaving. Trying to go after me. Which meant she would go after my team.</p><p>No.</p><p>I reformed, rose out of shadow behind Ishidate, becoming myself once more. I grabbed his head, one hand on either side and <em> twisted.</em></p><p>The snap should have been louder. It should have echoed.</p><p>It didn't. But Karenbana still turned around, slowly, like she knew what she was going to see and didn't want to see it.</p><p>"Explode," I commanded, and the corridor detonated around her. I could still sense her chakra – it hadn't killed her – but when I moved closer it was clear that it had been a near thing.</p><p>She glared at me, the last vestiges of her fighting spirit, struggling to stand.</p><p>"Run," I suggested, softly, dangerously.</p><p>She looked at me, expression a mask of loathing. But there was fear, too. I could kill her and she knew it.</p><p>She stumbled backwards, eyes flicking to the body on the floor, then back to me.</p><p>And ran.</p><p>My muscles tensed with the instinctive desire to <em> chase.</em> To hunt her down and kill her. Not because I had to, or needed to. But because I wanted to.</p><p>But Karenbana wasn't why I was here. She was irrelevant. I had the gauntlet now. Had the only information there had been to acquire. The only plan that remained to fix things – get to Tsunade.</p><p>Behind me, stone shifted, and there was a soft whimpering sound.</p><p>I turned to watch Michiru – Sai's ink clone – drag the minister out of the rubble. Alive, if not unharmed.</p><p><em> Oh right. The mission.</em></p><p>Well. That took care of that, didn't it?</p><p>A bird landed on the balcony rail – white and black and made of ink. I gave it a steady look. In another situation, I might have been able to summon amusement at how well Sai had learnt to bend around orders.</p><p>"Tell them to come back," I said. "We need to go home."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of the Moon Arc: Chapter 115</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 115</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.~ </em> <em> Martin Luther King, Jr.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I sat heavily on a piece of rubble and waited for my team to return. Hopefully Sai's bird could convince them to come back.</p><p>Now, I just … had to wait.</p><p>The last remaining ink clone gave up the ghost, suffering either damage or time or lack of chakra, and faded into a goopy pile of white and black. Now I was alone.</p><p>Well. Not 'alone'. There were plenty of people here – just not my people. Enemies, if not all by their own choices.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>I should probably do something about them before my team returned. Round up the guards. Announce Michiru's succession. Something.</p><p>Should.</p><p>But the future stretched out ahead of me like an impassable mountain. I didn't want to get up and take the first step towards climbing it; it was filled with things I didn't want to face. There was no path and there was no plan to get past it. It was just there.</p><p>But the future had a way of coming for you, even if you didn't want it.</p><p>There was a clatter of metal, boots against stone, and guards edged up the outer staircase and onto the balcony. They had weapons out, shields up, looking ready for danger.</p><p>I propped a foot up against a handy chunk of rock and relaxed my shoulders to look as casual as possible. But I twisted a kunai into my hand as well, because casual wasn't the same as unthreatening.</p><p>"Stop," I said.</p><p>They stopped.</p><p>The air hung, wary and tense, between us.</p><p>"You are under arrest," the leader said, voice level though not quite enough to hide the unease. "For attacking Shabadaba-sama."</p><p>I wondered if they actually thought that would work, or if it was just something they felt like they should be doing. If they'd known what the minister was up to, or if they'd thought the King and Prince were dead? Though that one wouldn't have held up with the return of Michiru.</p><p>"No," I said. "I'm not. <em> You</em> have committed treason, conspiring against the ruler of the Land of the Moon, and causing the death of King-" damn, what had his name even been? "Tsuki. Prince Michiru is now returning to take his rightful place and the minister will be tried for his crimes."</p><p>The guards in the doorway hovered, indecisively. I heard someone swallow, the sound echoing thickly.</p><p>They outnumbered me and they knew that. Logically, they should have had the upper hand. But they didn't, and they seemed to know that too.</p><p>"If you wait until the prince returns," I suggested, "then you become Captain Korega's problem." I twirled my kunai around my fingers, making it dance. "If you take another step forward… then you become mine. Take a look around," I invited. "See how I solve my problems."</p><p>Not the best speech I could have given. I just didn't have the energy to be convincing. But the point got across. The collapsed walls and bodies on the floor were hard to argue with.</p><p>I didn't want to fight them. But that didn't mean I couldn't. That I wouldn't.</p><p>I dug up a fraction more energy, enough to form <em> intent</em> and spread it into the air. Not killing intent – not quite as sharp or pointed – just enough to let them know I was serious.</p><p>"Go tend to your men," I suggested. The air shivered.</p><p>There was a long, long moment.</p><p>Then they backed down the stairs and left me alone.</p><p>Honestly, I hadn't expected that to work. At all. I hadn't <em> wanted</em> to have to fight a whole bunch of guards, but I'd almost expected I would have to.</p><p>Eventually, Sai's ink bird fluttered back and landed on my shoulder. I stroked it, curiously. It was… dry and almost soft. Paper-like. The feeling was unexpected. I didn't know what I had expected but… not that.</p><p>I took that to mean the others were nearly here.</p><p>Which meant the time for moping around doing nothing was over. If I didn't go to the mountain, then the mountain apparently came to me. Which was the problem of making the future into a metaphor, really.</p><p>I groaned and pulled myself to my feet, shaking off the dust that had clung to me. I scribbled up a body scroll for Ishidate and hauled Shabadaba over my shoulder. Whatever Sai had done to knock him out had worked because he was still out.</p><p>I dragged him down to the gates and told the guards to open them. There was a giant hole in the wall that people could have come through, but what kind of entrance was that? Michiru was going to be King – he would come in through the gates.</p><p>There was a minimum of hesitation before they did what I said, which probably had something to do with their leader being unconscious over my shoulder.</p><p>The sun was just peaking over the horizon as the Prince's group arrived. Korega and his guards formed a thin cordon around the group, and Kiba was grimly marching in the lead, Akamaru's head peeking out the front of his jacket.</p><p>Behind him, Shikamaru was stumbling along. For a second, my eyes played tricks on me. For a second, he looked okay – like everything had been undone and he had two arms. But no. His arm had been bandaged around the stump, a bulky white nub of bandages, and the arm that fluttered from it was a black and white ink creation.</p><p><em> Sai.</em> Well. It was creative problem solving. What good it would have done, I didn't know. Luckily, there was nothing left to fight.</p><p>I let out a very long breath and threw Shabadaba on the ground. "Prince Michiru!" I called. "The usurper has been apprehended. He awaits your judgement. Captain Korega! I turn the castle over to you."</p><p>Korega stepped forward, giving me a faintly disbelieving look that was quickly hidden by professionalism. He didn't have many guards on his side, and certainly wouldn't have been able to capture the place so outnumbered, but there was a difference between that and keeping control now that it was his. Hopefully.</p><p>Frankly, it wasn't my problem anymore and I didn't really care.</p><p>Shabadaba started to groan, awoken by his rough treatment, but I turned away. To my team. Korega could deal with him.</p><p>"The gauntlet was able to reverse the change," I said, the words nearly tripping over themselves to get out of my mouth. It wasn't much, not enough to be reassuring, but it came together to form something like a plan. "And I was able to retrieve it. If we return to Konoha, Tsunade-sama should be able to-"</p><p>"Shut up," Shikamaru croaked, stumbling forward. I was there before I registered moving, a low grade body flicker tucking myself up against his chest. He was heavy, leaning most of his weight against me. "Don't you ever- don't you ever do that again."</p><p>I stroked my hand over his back, checked his temperature and pulse. Too hot and too fast. "It's okay," I said. "Shh, everything is okay."</p><p>Over his shoulder I caught Kiba's eye. <em> Mission complete,</em> I signed one handed. <em> Return ASAP. </em></p><p>Kiba nodded, slowly.</p><p>Yeah, we were going to have problems there. But I could only deal with one at a time and Kiba was not my priority.</p><p>In the background, I could hear the minster speaking, a virulent storm of self-righteous justification. Michiru's responses cut through it, sounding more and more shaken, <em> why did you, how could you, it was all about </em> <em> <strong> money</strong> </em> <em> ?</em></p><p>"Once we get back to Konoha it'll be okay," I repeated, shutting them out. "We'll get a ship back right away."</p><p>If only it could be so simple.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The rocking of the ship was making me queasy.</p><p>I was flat on my back on the deck, which wasn't really helping, but Shikamaru was using my stomach as a pillow and I didn't want to move. The painkillers made him sleepy and tired but they were about all I could do for him, except obsessively checking the injury. The place where flesh turned to stone was heavily bruised and inflamed and I was using medical jutsu trying to keep the tissue from dying, but if I tried to revert it then I'd have to deal with the bleeding and possibly infection and all kinds of other complications. And if Tsunade could fix it, it was better to leave it untouched, surely?</p><p>I didn't know if I was making the right decision.</p><p>It was easier to focus on the motion of the waves. Easier to blame it for the nausea.</p><p>I squinted at the sun, high overhead. "Icarus is flying too close to the sun," I sung lowly, memories of the song stirred by the searing sunlight and the performance I'd given not too long ago. "Icarus's life, it has only just begun."</p><p>A shadow blocked the glare from my eyes. Sai edged closer, sat down beside my head.</p><p>"Icarus is flying towards an early grave…"</p><p>"An interesting story," Sai said blandly. "Highlighting the wisdom of following orders."</p><p>I squinted up at him, tilting my head back to look at him. "I think it's really about the price of pride and recklessness," I said. "And the tragedy when it's the young and the bright that die. But I guess you're not wrong."</p><p>All of which seemed really ironic right about now. Maybe he was thinking the same thing.</p><p>"I stayed with the ship," Sai said. Not quite defiantly. Not <em> quite.</em> "Like you ordered."</p><p>"I know you did," I said and smiled at him. "It was good. You did good. Thank you." He had, he really had. His ink clones had been directed – instructed? – well enough to keep the mission in mind. His ink bird had made it so much easier to wrap everything up at the end. He'd looked out for Shikamaru.</p><p>Something about him relaxed.</p><p>We sat in silence. I started to pet Shikamaru's hair.</p><p>"What was the stone?"</p><p>I froze. <em> Dammit.</em></p><p>"How much," I asked carefully, "do you have to report?"</p><p>Sai blinked down at me. He didn't try to pretend he didn't know what I was talking about. "Everything I saw with my own eyes," he said, contemplatively.</p><p>Which meant that what happened at the castle was safe. Sai could, most certainly, <em> guess</em> what had happened there. But he'd only <em> seen</em> the aftermath.</p><p>It wasn't much and he wasn't promising much but… it was a very careful line he was drawing.</p><p>I groped around on the deck until I found his hand and squeezed it. "I don't deserve you," I said, almost tiredly.</p><p>What had Sai done for us? Risked everything to tell us the truth, risked going against Danzo. Was going to <em> lie.</em> And what had we done for him in turn? Nothing. Could promise nothing, even, except vague hope that in future we could circumvent ROOT.</p><p>And even with that knowledge, I opened my mouth and lied. "I'm working on a chakra storage project for my clan," I said. "It's supposed to store chakra – or jutsu – in an object, and crystal matrices are the most stable. But it doesn't really work. As you saw."</p><p>None of it was a lie. Exactly.</p><p>Sai nodded, eyes bright and sharp. "A research project would have records," he said, cautiously.</p><p>I nodded. "It does." I squeezed his hand again. "It's not a secret."</p><p>If Danzo investigated, it could be verified. I would just look like a fool, pinning my hopes on something that could never work.</p><p>Clearly not a lie either.</p><p>"I see," Sai said. He disentangled his hand from mine. I heard the shuffling of paper, just out of my line of sight. Then the scratch of pencil on paper.</p><p>"What are you working on?" I asked, letting my eyes slip mostly closed.</p><p>Paper shuffled. "I want to draw a manga," Sai said.</p><p>"That's cool," I said with a hum. Maybe Kiba had been onto something introducing him to Samurai Genji after all. "What's it about?"</p><p>Sai paused. There were a lot of pauses in this conversation. "I don't know," he said. "Do you have a story for it?"</p><p>"A manga story, huh?" I had several. But which one to tell him? I had no doubt Danzo would go through everything Sai did, so something like Bleach – invading Soul Society to rescue one person – or One Piece with its freedom from government would just be adding fuel to the fire. Maybe Inuyasha – the time travelling well wouldn't even be so unusual.</p><p>Or.</p><p>The idea of forcing Danzo to read a story where the main characters were <em> literally</em> soldiers of love and justice was just too good to pass up.</p><p>I opened my eyes and smiled. "Okay. So. A long time ago, there was a kingdom on the moon called the Silver Millennium –"</p><p><hr /></p><p>The ship was the slowest part of our journey – once we hit the shore I called Heijomaru back to help us run.</p><p>"I am pleased to see you well, summoner," he rumbled, flicking an ear back and forth. "There was some concern over your state of affairs."</p><p>"Thank you," I said, a little nervously. Fleeing from battle was one thing – being used as transport was quite another. "And thank you for your help. I'm afraid I have another favour to ask of you, though."</p><p>It wasn't that Shikamaru couldn't run, it wasn't his legs that were damaged, after all, but that kind of sustained exertion was also really strenuous and wouldn't be good for him</p><p>Luckily, Heijomaru didn't refuse. We were able to make it back to the gates of Konoha in just over a day, which was fair timing.</p><p><em> Not good enough</em> , I thought. But the best we could do. Those two things had never seemed so different.</p><p>"We're heading to the hospital first," I told the gate guard. "Please send a runner to the Hokage to let her know she will be needed."</p><p>He looked like he was going to protest, so I gave him a perfectly level stare that belied how very not level I was.</p><p>He raised his hands. "It's on your head," he said.</p><p>"Yes," I agreed. "It is."</p><p>I dragged Shikamaru inside. Kiba paced alongside us, two steps off, like he had the whole trip.</p><p>"I'm heading to the clinic," he said, without looking at me. "I'll hand my report in later." He didn't wait for a reply before taking off. Not that I would have said anything.</p><p>"You can be dismissed as well, Sai," I said, absently. I felt, more than saw, him leave.</p><p>And then it was just me and Shikamaru and the flurry of the hospital. I was struck with the sheer <em> wrongness</em> of it, as I helped Shikamaru inside – it was usually the other way around. Shikamaru got through his missions without injury. It was <em> me </em> that-</p><p>The first nurse handled Shikamaru with a professional, brisk sympathy, for triage and assessment. They took blood and ran tests and gave him painkillers, which was good because no matter how well stocked my medkit was it hadn't exactly had enough.</p><p>And then they unwound the bandages over his arm, and the situation was upgraded pretty quickly. Tsunade didn't come immediately, but since I'd already sent for her it was probably faster than it should have been.</p><p>"Tell me what happened," Tsunade said, hands glowing a gentle green as she ran her own diagnostics.</p><p>Shikamaru was silent.</p><p>I took a deep breath and spun the gauntlet out of my hammerspace. The smell of charred flesh filled the air because it still happened to be on Ishidate's arm. It was still warm, perfectly preserved in storage space like I'd only cut it off minutes ago.</p><p>"One of our enemies during this mission possessed the ability to petrify flesh to stone," I started. "Using this gauntlet. I believe it manipulates and injects natural energy…"</p><p>And once I'd started it was near impossible to stop talking, describing what little I'd seen of the gauntlet in use – how Ishidate had managed to reverse the change – what it had done to the King and how he'd died, what had happened to Shikamaru and what we'd done after that to help him.</p><p>"But Ishidate <em> was</em> able to reverse it!" I repeated. "And I collected all… all of… I have a storage scroll. It should be possible."</p><p>Tsunade was looking at me with something that looked faintly like pity in her eyes.</p><p>It was asking a miracle of her, and she hadn't even seen how many pieces it was in. I knew that. But we'd had miracles before. It wasn't <em> impossible.</em> Just very, very difficult.</p><p>"Leave it here," she instructed. "Then wait outside."</p><p>I looked at Shikamaru. He didn't protest it. Didn't ask me to stay.</p><p>I rocked back on my heels and reluctantly moved from my guard position beside the bed, for the first time since we'd entered this room. I didn't want to, but you didn't argue with Tsunade.</p><p>I sank into a chair in the waiting room.</p><p>So. That was that.</p><p>In some strange way, I felt relieved. I shouldn't have; nothing was fixed, nothing was better. But I'd got us home. I'd handed Shikamaru off to someone who was more equipped to help, to the person who was <em> best</em> equipped to help. If there was anything to be done for him now, it wasn't up to me to do it.</p><p>My knee jiggled as my foot tapped against the floor. I stared down the quiet hallway. The door remained shut.</p><p>I got up.</p><p>Someone had to go let mum and dad know we were back.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Shikamaru was kept in the hospital overnight, with no word to us what was going on. No word to me, anyway. I suspected Dad knew more but he didn't come home either.</p><p>"Well," Mum said bracingly. "Let's get you taken care of. You're alright, aren't you, dear?"</p><p>"Fine," I said, tiredly. "My armour did its job." Between the underarmour and the vest, even the hits I'd taken hadn't been bad. And they'd healed, anyway, when I'd transformed.</p><p>"Good, good," she said. "That's what it's for."</p><p>But even after coming home, cleaning up and repacking, I didn't want to sleep. I was tired enough, but I didn't want to.</p><p>Instead, I pulled out a pen and paper and started writing my mission report. There was a lot to say.</p><p>I didn't… I didn't <em> skim</em> over what I'd done. Hedged on the <em> how</em> maybe, but I'd made mistakes and I knew them. By the time I was finished, it was full of scathing indictment and dangerous phrases.</p><p>…<em> [failed to anticipate]… [abandoned the mission objective]… [separated from the team]… [emotional reactions]… [failed to listen to recommendations]… [unsuitable for leadership role]…</em></p><p>Any one of those was probably enough to get me in trouble. All of it? Well. They would know how things went down.</p><p>I handed it in the next morning, when there had still been no word on what was happening to Shikamaru. He wasn't even allowed visitors, which either meant things were more serious than I'd thought, or that he was being constantly pulled between appointments. Which at least meant they were <em> doing something</em> , didn't it?</p><p>Ino and Chouji were both out of the village on a mission, and I was honestly so relieved about that. I couldn't imagine telling them.</p><p>But Tenten wasn't, and I dawdled as long as I could, feeling guiltier by the minute and dragged myself over to Team Gai's training field because she needed to know, too.</p><p>"Hey," I said quietly. "You have a minute?"</p><p>"Sure," she replied, ducking away from the boys. Lee gave an enthusiastic wave. "Welcome back. How was your mission?"</p><p>I nodded and cleared my throat. "About that. Tenten-" I'd had the words planned out, and they deserted me right when I needed them. "Shikamaru was injured. He's in the hospital. He's going to be fine! Tsunade-sama is looking after him. But… he was injured. That's all. I thought you should know."</p><p>Her face went through a series of very complicated expressions, settling on hesitance. It was one thing to know it was a possibility, intellectually, that people got hurt on missions. It was another to see it happen. It was something else to just hear about it in the aftermath. "What happened?"</p><p>"He-" the explanation stuck in my throat. I forced it out. "His arm was damaged. Tsunade-sama should be able to save it. But, um, he's not allowed visitors at the moment. So they're probably still working on it."</p><p>"Right," Tenten said, like she wasn't sure what to do next.</p><p>I sympathized. "Yeah. That was. That was all. I'll, um, let you get back to training. Or whatever."</p><p>What did you do after someone dropped information like that on you? I didn't know either.</p><p>I beat a hasty retreat.</p><p>But it wasn't to be. As I walked back past the Hokage Tower, a familiar voice called my name, and Inoichi's hand dropped down onto my shoulder.</p><p>"There you are," he said. "I've been looking for you."</p><p><em> Shit</em> , I thought, as he steered me into the building and up to one of the briefing rooms. <em> What now?</em></p><p>"I just had a few questions about your mission report," he said easily, pressing me into a chair and sitting across the table. He dropped a familiar scroll on the table between us.</p><p>I squinted at him. "Why do you have it?"</p><p>"There were a few concerns raised," Inoichi said smoothly. "And someone had to evaluate it. Tsunade-sama is very busy right now and obviously your father has conflicts of interest, so can't be the one to do it."</p><p>"But the next best thing is okay?" I asked, a little skeptically. But I slouched in my chair a little, because this was something I'd expected. Just not so fast, or from Inoichi.</p><p>He flashed me a bright smile. "I had to call in a few favours," he said, like it was a joke. "But I think we can get this sorted out easily enough. There's just a couple of lines to clarify." He slipped another paper onto the desk, filled with his own neat handwriting. "I have suggestions, if you need them."</p><p>I glanced at it and sank further down into my chair. "With respect," I said, "my report is a true and factual account of what happened."</p><p>"Two of your team have handed in their reports already," Inoichi said. "Neither of them contain any negative assessment of your capabilities. And I'm willing to wager your last team member won't either."</p><p>"That doesn't change the facts," I said quietly. "Even if they didn't report it, they didn't agree at the time." Kiba had basically mutinied on me. Or whatever the <em> justified</em> word for mutiny was. Calling no confidence and taking over the role himself. I'd praised him for it, in my report, for keeping a cool head and managing when I hadn't. He'd been right. Objectively, Kiba had done everything he'd been trained to do, perfectly.</p><p>"We all make decisions on missions," Inoichi said gently. He reached across the table and touched my hand. "We all react. The decision you made wasn't a disaster. Shikako, listen to me. Maybe no one would have agreed to let you go off on your own, but you succeeded. In hindsight… it looks very much like the right call. Because it <em> worked.</em> "</p><p>I huffed in frustration. "Hindsight doesn't matter. It was an emotional decision. It was reckless. I shouldn't- I shouldn't be allowed to make those calls."</p><p>"Hindsight does matter," Inoichi said firmly. "Because <em> results</em> matter. If you told me, right now, that the entire thing was planned from the start then I would believe you. It looks like a plan that worked. Yes, maybe it was reckless. Yes, it could have gone very wrong. But it didn't and those are things you can improve on. Having this on your record isn't going to help you in any way."</p><p>He squeezed my hand. I stared at it, feeling cracked open.</p><p>"I know you feel like you should be punished for it," he said gently. "But what happened to Shikamaru isn't your fault."</p><p>I couldn't breathe.</p><p><em> This</em> , I thought irritably<em> , is exactly why you don't talk to Inoichi.</em></p><p>"I wouldn't improve it because I'm not sorry," I said, defiantly. But I didn't look up at him. I couldn't risk catching his eyes. "That I left the team. That I went to the castle alone. That I killed them. I would make the same choice again. <em> That's</em> why it needs to be in the report."</p><p>Inoichi sat back. I let go of his hand and pressed mine flat against the table. There was a moment of silence. I didn't think, not for a second, that he had given up.</p><p>But I was feeling stubborn, too. Like I wanted to dig my heels in. I'd written that report for a reason, and yeah, maybe that reason was <em> spite</em> . I was the type of person to cut off my nose to spite my face, as the saying went.</p><p>"You know-" Inoichi started to say.</p><p>Then the door to the room slid open and Kakashi-sensei ambled inside. He didn't have his Icha-Icha out, but he still managed to make the entire thing look coincidental and casual. "Oh, Shikako. Fancy seeing you here."</p><p>Inoichi stared at him. "We're in the middle of something here, Hatake," he said.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei gave him a cheerful eye curving smile. And totally ignored the suggestion to leave. "I heard something about you having an interesting mission report," he said, and plucked it off the table. "Tsk, tsk. Those desk ninja really do gossip a lot."</p><p>Inoichi made an aborted grab for it that really didn't stand a chance of succeeding. "Must you really?" he asked.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll hand it back in," Kakashi-sensei said dismissively. "Eventually."</p><p>So, never. Really.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Writer problems – not writing down cool scenes when you have the idea and thus forgetting them when it comes time to actually write them. Here is the Return To Konoha, anyway.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of the Moon Arc: Chapter 116</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: A short chapter, but the answer to the question that everyone has been asking.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 116</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us. ~ </em> <em> Joseph Campbell</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"This is awful," I said – complained, really – to mum.</p><p>There had been relief in handing Shikamaru over to the hospital, to Tsunade, to people who knew better and could help him. But it hadn't… it didn't feel like it was over. They hadn't healed him yet. And they weren't saying anything.</p><p>Surely, if they could do it… it would already been done? I could tell you the steps – reverse the transformation, stitch the pieces back together, reattach the arm – so why was the clock ticking ever longer with no word?</p><p>"How do you stand it?" I asked.</p><p>She gave me a smile that was more than a little sad. "Badly," she said and I tried not to think about how many times mum had done this. Had just… waited to know if we would be okay. And yeah, most of that had been me.</p><p>A month of that had been me.</p><p>But we weren't <em> doing</em> anything. I wasn't contributing, I wasn't trying to help fix it; I was just uselessly sitting around.</p><p>Wasn't there something I could <em> do?</em></p><p>Everything I knew about natural energy could fit in a thimble and there was no easy way to change that. Not quickly enough to help in this situation. The medical skills required were beyond me.</p><p>I shifted, restless. Tapped my foot against the floor. Wasted time.</p><p><em> Would it be rude if I went training?</em> I thought guiltily, glancing out the waiting room window. It was… proper to stay. Expected. And it meant I could hear, right away, when they were finished and Shikamaru was allowed visitors.</p><p>Only, until then, there was nothing I could do here. And it was hard to focus on my books, on <em> thinking</em> of something else, when our surroundings were such a reminder.</p><p>I felt caught. Pinned in place. Trapped. I wanted to just… get away from it.</p><p>"Go," Mum said, sounding almost resigned.</p><p>My eyes snapped back to her.</p><p>"You can go," she said, like she was releasing me from obligation. "Just come back, okay?"</p><p><em> We're always leaving</em> , I thought, like it was something I had to realise. Like we were talking about something bigger. Maybe we were.</p><p>We were always leaving. Mum had never been one to hold us back – the one to nag us to train, to be safe, to look after ourselves and not take risks, but never to hold us back. And she was always here, a safe haven to come back to when we were finished.</p><p>I stood, then bent so I could press a kiss to her cheek. "I'll come back," I promised. "But I can't just wait."</p><p>I could fight. I could plan. I could gather information and discover how to fix things. But waiting like this… waiting and doing nothing…</p><p>I couldn't stand it. It felt <em> helpless.</em> I'd had too much of feeling helpless.</p><p>I swallowed the guilt I felt and walked out of the hospital. They were taking care of Shikamaru and there was nothing I could do to change the outcome. When there was a place for me, I'd come back.</p><p>Until then… there were problems I could fix.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Kakashi-sensei was sitting at a desk in the War Operations open command room, writing busily.</p><p>I paused in the doorway, second guessing myself. If he was <em> actually working</em> then I probably shouldn't interrupt. It shouldn't have been a surprise because everyone was terribly busy and there was no reason Kakashi-sensei should have been an exception. Quite the opposite.</p><p>"You aren't getting it back," he said, flicking a glance up at me in acknowledgment of my presence before going back to what he was doing. "So you can consider your arguments argued."</p><p>I blinked. "Oh. That. No." To be perfectly honest, I accepted that I had been out maneuvered. No point in continuing to play a strategy that was already defeated. I'd been willing to dig my heels in against Inoichi trying to get me to change it, because that was a <em> fight</em> but Kakashi-sensei had just removed the battlefield entirely. Unfair, but I was grudgingly impressed by the unfairness.</p><p>"Are you… busy?" I asked, creeping forward towards his desk. He didn't block any of it from my sight, so it couldn't have been classified. Actually… I tilted my head. "Is that a jutsu?"</p><p>There was a grid of handseals and a chakra map and a balancing equation that I placed after a second as describing the mental/physical energy mix. It all looked terribly complicated.</p><p>There was a reason that learning jutsu from written descriptions were far more complicated than learning from demonstrations. It took a whole lot of writing to equal what could be covered with 'here, watch this'. I wasn't entirely sure that I could reconstruct a jutsu I'd never seen before from something like that.</p><p>One of the other ninja in the room looked up slowly and turned a glare on Kakashi-sensei. He gave a blasé eye smile to them and stood, snapping the book shut and tucking it into the inner pocket of his jacket.</p><p><em> Oops, not work after all.</em></p><p>"Something like that," Kakashi said, one hand touching down on my shoulder to turn me back towards the door.</p><p>"Sorry," I said sheepishly, stepping back out into the corridor. He came with me, though, so he couldn't have been that annoyed.</p><p>"Thought I would write some of them down," he said, slouching and tucking his hands in his pockets. "You and Sasuke are smart enough to learn them without killing yourselves." He squinted thoughtfully into the distance, like he was considering the point again. "Probably."</p><p>"Or you could, you know, teach us them?" I hazarded, frowning. "Sasuke's got this neat thing called the Sharingan that I'm told makes learning easier."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei muttered something vague about time and energy, which I supposed made sense. There was a limit to the number of jutsu he could demonstrate, based simply on chakra capacity, though that number was still probably more that we could learn through textbooks and diagrams.</p><p>Then I realized I was arguing <em> against</em> writing stuff down and went quiet. Written words lasted. They could reach more people.</p><p>There were probably people that would kill a non-insignificant number to get their hands on a compilation of jutsu written by Kakashi Hatake, the Copy Ninja.</p><p>"So?" he prompted, as we wove our way out of the tower.</p><p><em> Right.</em> I had come for a reason. "Poison," I said. "Airborne. Contact. How do you…"</p><p>"Don't be in it?" Sensei suggested thoughtfully.</p><p>"Gee," I said drolly. "That didn't occur to me at all."</p><p>I had… some ideas, actually. My rudimentary oxygen tanks could be improved, and there were obviously ways to filter oxygen with chakra, if Kakashi's 'breathing underwater' trick was anything to go by. As for skin contact… the scent suppressing jutsu I'd been learning worked by keeping skin particles from spreading <em> out.</em> By containing them. If that layer could be reversed, or double sided, to make a barrier to also keep things from getting <em> in…</em></p><p>"But those don't help anyone else," I finished. "If something like that happens again… we'd still have problems."</p><p>"There's always wind jutsu," Kakashi-sensei offered, as our feet took us toward the training grounds. "If you can't avoid it, then better to get rid of it as best you can. A gust should do it, if you're outside. If you're inside it might be harder."</p><p>If you were inside there wouldn't be fresh air to replace it with, and that was absolutely something to keep in mind. Otherwise, it seemed like a simple and obvious solution.</p><p>"There's also an even easier trick that works for small areas," he went on. And then raised his chakra until it flared.</p><p>Leaves on the ground danced, rising up. I felt the tug of wind as it pulled at my clothes.</p><p><em> Of course.</em> I'd even seen this before, using chakra to stir air into motion. Naruto had done it, uncontrolled but powerful during his match with Neji, and Kakashi had done it even before that to get rid of Zabuza's fog in the Land of Waves.</p><p>I hadn't even thought of it.</p><p>I tried to mimic it, pulling up my chakra and letting it stir. It took a few tries to even get the briefest movement of wind – I was far more used to pulling tight and dampening it down than letting it spill out like that. This was basically the opposite of suppression techniques.</p><p>All that effort put into minimizing the mark I left on the world and now I was trying to do the very opposite. It figured.</p><p>But it felt good to work on something, to struggle and then succeed. No hidden traps. No unexpected problems. Just a simple technique to learn that would be invaluable in future.</p><p>"What else?" Kakashi-sensei asked, once I had it mostly down.</p><p>I considered. What else did I need to work on? "Taijutsu?" I suggested, and bounced lightly on my toes.</p><p>The almost painful tension in my shoulders released into a ready fluidity as I brought my hands up.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Dad was there when I woke the next morning, talking softly to mum.</p><p>I slipped out the back door and went to feed the deer. The morning was crisp and cold and there was dew on the grass and birds were singing in the trees. It was going to be a nice day.</p><p>When I couldn't stall any longer, I went home. Breakfast was ready, but I barely picked at it.</p><p>I'd seen their faces. There was no good news here.</p><p>"The Hokage has been looking into Shikamaru's condition," Dad said, very softly, very quietly. "You did well to bring back so much information, so many resources. The hospital has studied them extensively."</p><p>I blinked, slowly and heavily. "She can't fix it," I said. It wasn't a question.</p><p>Dad sighed. I had the feeling he'd wanted to lead into it, had wanted to break the news gently. But I'd <em> known</em> . I'd seen it break. I'd known, since that fixed unchangable moment in time, that we would be asking for a miracle. That pinning your hopes on long odds didn't always pay off.</p><p>I didn't have anything telling me this would. No future where Shikamaru had been healed – because there had never been a future where Shikamaru had been <em> hurt.</em></p><p>I'd hoped. Hoped so desperately that undoing the transformation and piecing the pieces back together was within Tsunade's ability.</p><p>"No," Dad agreed. "She can't fix it." He paused, as if waiting for me to say something then went on. "Tsunade led a team of surgeons through an attempted reversal procedure on the arm yesterday – but it was unsuccessful."</p><p>There had never been a future where Shikamaru was hurt. Never a possibility that this could have happened to him. Shikamaru <em> didn't</em> get hurt. He was always, always fine.</p><p>This… this was because of me. Because I lead the mission. Because I'd made a mistake. Because I existed.</p><p>Shikamaru – wounded because I existed. Ino – damaged because I existed. All I had to do now was ruin Chouji and I'd have a full set.</p><p>I swallowed, throat clicking dryly. Took a drink. "So," I said, blankly. "What happens now?"</p><p>Dad gave me a very measured look, like he was wondering if this was a conversation we should be having. It felt ridiculous, almost, to be talking so calmly. The sun was shining. The day was fine. We were discussing my brother's missing arm over breakfast.</p><p>"Shikamaru will go into surgery today," Dad said. "They'll keep him a few more days for observation and then…"</p><p>"That's up to him," Mum said, firmly. "And there doesn't have to be any kind of decision made now. If he wants to continue as a field ninja, or doesn't, or what he wants to do about it… there's plenty of time to make a choice."</p><p>I wondered if this was what they'd been talking about before, while I'd been out. I took another drink. "Okay," I said, because what else was there to say.</p><p>"It will be a difficult adjustment," Dad pointed out. "He'll need you to be here, Shikako."</p><p>I nodded, still blankly. "Okay."</p><p>I hadn't been here before. That had been a problem for him. Now he was the one hurt. Obviously I should be here. Be around. That made sense. Dad was right.</p><p>"How long will he be in the hospital?"</p><p>"Another few days," Dad answered. "He needs surgery, and Tsunade wants to keep him under observation for a while, to make sure it's healing after that and there are no other complications."</p><p>I nodded. I felt like a wind-up toy. Nod. Nod. Nod.</p><p>After breakfast I went around to Sakura's house. "Sorry to stop by so early," I said with an awkward nod to her parents. "I just wanted to catch you before you went to the hospital."</p><p>"I, um, I heard about Shikamaru," Sakura said, tucking her hair behind her ear. "I'm sorry."</p><p>I nodded at the sympathy, not really sure how to respond to that. "I guess you can tell why I'm here, then?"</p><p>"I can guess," Sakura said, a little wryly. "I was just about to go. Let me grab my books and we can talk on the way?"</p><p>I made small talk with her parents while she scuttled around, grabbing her backpack and picking up a bento from the kitchen.</p><p>"You wanted to know what … treatment plans the hospital has," Sakura said, once we were outside.</p><p>I pushed my hands into my pockets. "Yeah, something like that."</p><p>She pursed her lips in thought. "Well, I guess it depends on how bad it is? I mean, how far-"</p><p>I made a vague line across my bicep, about halfway to the elbow, without speaking.</p><p>"-oh. The Konoha transplant program is very advanced, you know," she offered. "It always has been, but with Tsunade-sama back it's even more so."</p><p>"Would it work?" I asked, quietly. "Organs… eyes… that's one thing. An arm is more complicated. Especially chakra pathways and things. If you wanted to be able to do jutsu…"</p><p>"I could look it up," Sakura offered. "I think there's prosthetics as well? I've never seen any, though."</p><p>Me neither – which might have meant a lot of things. People preferred transplants, maybe. Or prosthetics were too expensive, too complicated, too rare, not a good fit for field ninja…</p><p>"Thanks," I said, as we drifted to a stop outside the hospital. "I owe you one."</p><p>"Don't be silly," Sakura said and bit her lip. Then she stepped forward and hugged me. "It'll be okay."</p><p>I managed a weak smile back at her. "Thanks," I repeated.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Junipearlee has created a DOS reddit thread and needs moderators, if any of you are redditors and interested in checking that out. PM her if you're interested.</p><p>No one seems to like short-chapters-fast so this almost wraps up the whole situation. Just a little more to go.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 117</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. – Chinese proverb</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>If I had to play another game of shogi, I was going to scream.</p><p>I liked shogi as much as the next Nara. Well, maybe not the next Nara because that was <em> Shikamaru</em> and that was totally the problem. It was all he'd done since he'd come home. Just… hunched over the board and played.</p><p>We hadn't even done morning exercises.</p><p>I was <em> actually</em> going to scream.</p><p>My knee bounced with repressed energy. I didn't normally consider myself a restless person. I wasn't a restless person. The first few years of our lives had been pretty much this, every day. I liked calm, inactivity and not doing much.</p><p>But right now I wanted to be doing things. And I couldn't, because Shikamaru was <em> here.</em></p><p>I couldn't leave him.</p><p>Shikamaru clicked his final piece down on the board. His victory had been coming for twelve moves, assured and unbeatable. I'd let it play out mostly out of inertia. Stopping the game to declare victory would have only started another one and there was no point.</p><p>"I win," Shikamaru said, dully. Everything was dull. Everything was grey. "Another one?"</p><p>He started picking his pieces off the board, awkwardly. One handed.</p><p>I swallowed. "Sure," I said, defeated. I picked up mine, so very aware that I had two hands to do it with. How much faster it went. How much easier it was. Even for something so simple as this. Something I would have never even thought about or considered.</p><p>His left arm – what was left of it – was bandaged, just enough to peek out of the sleeve of his t-shirt. I didn't look at it, no one had talked about it, but there was no ignoring it.</p><p><em> If you scream in the forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound?</em></p><p>"You know," I said, clearing my throat. "I should summon Heijomaru and thank him for helping us. Did you want to go down to Sembei-obaasan's place?"</p><p>"No," Shikamaru said, and didn't look up from the board.</p><p>I fell silent. 'He'll need you here,' Dad had said, but it didn't look like it. Didn't look like I was doing any good. The silence between us was heavy and oppressive and I didn't know how to break it. I was trying. I was trying but-</p><p>Shikamaru had shut me out.</p><p>I guessed it was only fair.</p><p>I didn't know what he wanted – his silences indicated he wanted to be left alone. <em> I</em> would have wanted to be left alone. But I'd been told to stay. And I thought that at any other time he would have wanted me to stay too.</p><p>"Are you… angry at me?" I asked, tentatively. It was the first time I'd referenced the mission and I regretted it immediately. This wasn't the time. It wasn't the place. Shikamaru was hurt and clearly still hurting – I couldn't be selfish enough to make that about <em> me.</em></p><p>There was a long silence. I thought he wasn't going to answer.</p><p>"No," he said, finally.</p><p>I kept my mouth shut. Didn't say anything more about the failed mission. Didn't protest that he probably should be – that I'd been responsible for keeping him safe. That I'd made mistakes I shouldn't have.</p><p>Shikamaru was hurt. This wasn't about my guilt.</p><p>I knew how <em> that</em> felt. He didn't have to comfort me, right now. I wouldn't put that on him.</p><p>I retreated and let the endless click-clack of shogi wash over me.</p><p>We were still playing when Dad came home, accompanied by Kofuku and Igaku. It was pretty clear what the topic of conversation was going to be, when you brought R&amp;D and the hospital into it.</p><p>Shikamaru had to guess, too. But he only looked apathetic.</p><p>They didn't jump straight into it, but I tuned out the small talk and polite lead up. My years of experience as a wallflower were standing me in good stead here, because no one really tried to drag me into it.</p><p>"I understand you've already turned down the transplant," Igaku said, finally broaching the topic we all knew they were here to discuss.</p><p>Though not quite. Because what. That was the first I'd heard of it. I'd assumed it was up for discussion. I hadn't realized it had already been discussed.</p><p>I tried not to feel hurt at not knowing. This wasn't <em> mine</em> . It wasn't about me.</p><p>"To be honest," Kofuku said, picking up the thread. "That's probably your best option. Our regeneration research simply isn't advanced enough to regrow an arm. We're talking years before we have working models."</p><p>"With a transplant," Igaku went on, "the best case scenario is that you'd regain about 80 percent functionality. You'd be back at combat readiness after a few months of physical therapy."</p><p>"I don't want," Shikamaru said, "some strangers arm just… stuck on me." He hunched forward a little bit, tucked his arm in closer like that would protect it.</p><p>It wasn't a rational objection – a gut level, instinctive revulsion. In a way I could understand it, the feeling of <em> wrongness</em> , of <em> not mine</em> that would come of it.</p><p>"Is it the 'stranger' part that bothers you?" I asked, too fast. The words spilt out my mouth before they'd been considered.</p><p>Dad's eyes widened. Igaku and Kofuku exchanged looks. And Shikamaru turned towards me.</p><p>But it was too late to take them back.</p><p>"What?" Shikamaru asked, voice going even flatter. Like he knew what I'd asked, what it meant. Where this interjection was going to go.</p><p>"Is it the 'stranger' part that bothers you?" I asked again, resigned. I felt like a character in a play, compelled to say my lines. "Or the donor? Because if it is…" I paused, not because I didn't know what I was going to say, but because it was going to go over <em> so badly.</em> "You could have mine."</p><p>There was a chance that the Gelel stone – Shikako stone, heart stone, whatever it was – would heal me. It did, <em> had,</em> but I wasn't prepared to count on it after it had let me down so very badly.</p><p>"Why would you even think that's an okay thing to <em> offer?</em> " Shikamaru demanded, voice cracking.</p><p>I shrugged and didn't look at him. "Well, if your issue with it is that the donor is a <em> stranger</em> …"</p><p>"And you thought…" he paused, incredulously. "You thought that somehow that would be <em> better?</em> "</p><p>"I thought it would be an option," I said, calmly, carelessly, like it had been a perfectly normal back and forth. Like there was no more to be said about this, no reason to get upset.</p><p>It didn't work. Of course. But I gave myself points for having tried.</p><p>"It's not an option!"</p><p>I tried not to flinch back at the sudden volume of his voice. Yep, very much did not work.</p><p>"I would have to agree," Igaku-oba said, cutting in through the conversation with a calm but firm manner. She was trying to deescalate. "I could not, in good conscience, perform a surgery that left a healthy shinobi in a damaged state, willing donor or not. Konoha Hospital certainly wouldn't agree to such a thing."</p><p>That only presumed <em> if</em> I were in a worse state than before. And though I couldn't argue such a thing to Igaku, Tsunade herself might know the possibilities of the stone. And even if she wasn't willing to test it…</p><p>Well.</p><p>Once I turned up at the hospital with a spare arm…</p><p>But it was all a moot point if Shikamaru wouldn't take it. Totally and utterly moot.</p><p>"Of course, Igaku-obasan," I said, inclining my head, accepting her statement. She looked appeased.</p><p>Dad, I noticed, did not.</p><p>And neither did Shikamaru.</p><p>"You," he said, and choked on it. His hand reached out towards me, grabbing at my throat – at my neck. It wasn't fast, wasn't dangerous, but I fought down the instinctive <em> recoil</em> that the motion prompted.</p><p>He wasn't grabbing me, though. He was grabbing the thin black leather cord around my neck, pulling free the necklace from beneath my shirt.</p><p>"This is <em> it,</em> " he said, dawning with horror as if he were only just working it out. "You kept it. You <em> kept</em> it."</p><p>Maybe he was only just working it out. He hadn't exactly been in a great state of mind when he'd seen it. Probably hadn't known what I was trying to do, simply because it hadn't worked and there'd been nothing to see.</p><p>"Why <em> the hell</em> would you keep it?" Shikamaru demanded. His hand tightened into a fist and pulled, slightly, drawing the cord tight around the back of my neck. It was a quick release knot – if he pulled harder it would come loose. "You know what it <em> did!"</em></p><p>I curled my hand over top of his and stopped him. It was <em> mine.</em></p><p>"I thought," I said, words carefully measured, "that it would be useful."</p><p>My words had to be carefully measured. This was an S-rank secret, family or not. And Shikamaru had better be careful too.</p><p>(<em> Why did he always try and do this in front of people? Doesn't he know it's </em> <em> <strong> dangerous</strong> </em> <em> ?)</em></p><p>I met his eyes squarely and unflinching, trying to project seriousness. "I'm sorry it didn't work, Shikamaru. But let it go."</p><p>He dropped it, like it was hot. Recoiled, like I'd said something terrible to him.</p><p><em> Shit. Shit. </em></p><p>Gelel was – obviously – a touchy subject for him. And that piled on top of this, which was bad enough in its own right… everything was going wrong.</p><p>And there wasn't really any way for me to fix any of it.</p><p>"What is that?" Kofuku-oba said, eyes eagle sharp. "Is that part of your research project? Let me see it."</p><p>I tucked it back into my shirt instead. "No. It's classified."</p><p>She gave a disbelieving snort. For good reason – if you compared the security clearances of all the people in this room, I was hardly the one to be telling people things were classified.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Dad nodded slowly, eyes looking between the two of us. I didn't know if he <em> knew</em> exactly – didn't know if Tsunade had let him in on the whole mission – but there was only one mission Shikamaru and I had been on that would be unanimously classified to everyone regardless of level.</p><p>"Perhaps we should get back to the topic at… hand," he said, and blinked slowly, as if it had actually pained him to say it once he realized.</p><p>Shikamaru groaned and covered his face. "Dad," he whined.</p><p>It was such a relief. Such a break in tension, a return to some kind of normality. I didn't presume to think that any of this was <em> over</em> but… well. I was all for postponing arguments. I was happy to postpone this forever.</p><p>Dad cleared his throat. "Regardless," he said. "Are you certain you don't want a transplant?"</p><p>"I'm sure," Shikamaru said. And then glared, very slightly, in my direction. "<em> Any</em> kind of transplant."</p><p>"Keep it in mind," Igaku-oba suggested. "You don't have to decide now, while emotions are running so high. Spend some time thinking about it."</p><p>"Unfortunately," Kofuku-oba said, "there really isn't much in the way of alternatives. Hidden Sand has some great prosthetics but while they're not so complicated to <em> replicate</em> ... they're operated by chakra strings so require a fairly decent grasp of the discipline."</p><p>A puppet master like Chiyo might be able to do it without a thought, but it would take <em> dozens</em> of chakra strings operated with precision control … from a stump of an arm. It wasn't exactly an easy beginner task.</p><p>"As far as non-permanent solutions go," she went on, "the most I can suggest is some form of Shadow Stitching Jutsu or Shadow Neckbind. Have you started on those already?"</p><p>"They have," Dad confirmed. "Though using them without seals…"</p><p>"Will be difficult," she agreed. "And draining, if you have to do it constantly. It's not going to give you anything near the utility of an actual arm, either, but if you're serious about refusing simpler solutions…"</p><p>They were talking about control and mastery of a jutsu that was definitely A-rank if not higher. It was a lot to ask.</p><p>It wasn't...</p><p>It wasn't exactly that I thought Shikamaru <em> couldn't</em> do it.</p><p>It was just that, right now, there was no indication that he really wanted to.</p><p>Shikamaru's only professed ambition had been to be average. He could still do his job in Logistics with only one arm. He could still manage the kind of Konoha-based desk duty that most career chunin did. He'd be average.</p><p>I wasn't…</p><p>I wasn't sure how much I liked the thought. It wasn't bad. Not really – if it was what Shikamaru wanted to do and what would make him happy…</p><p>But it felt so much <em> less.</em></p><p>Less than he could be, than he should be. Like something would be missing.</p><p>And like I would never have Shikamaru at my back again. Not directly – every mission we'd been on together had gone terribly and I wasn't sure I ever wanted repeats of any of those – but a more distant feeling of knowing that he was there and could handle what was thrown at him.</p><p>I would move on to opponents that picked fights with jinchuriki… and he would be helpless.</p><p>And that –</p><p>That thought was like a knife in the gut, twisting.</p><p>Kofuku and Igaku picked up and left, leaving us in a heavily awkward silence.</p><p>Dad sighed and ran a hand over his face. "I think we all need to talk," he said gently.</p><p>I crinkled my nose. That was the worst idea. Talking had really not solved anything so far. <em> Talking</em> was only making things worse.</p><p>"Shikako," he said then then stopped, almost helplessly. "Shikako. No one wants you to be hurt. You understand that, don't you?"</p><p>I sighed, and obliged him. "I know that," I affirmed. "And I know that my suggestion wasn't really very helpful and that Shikamaru wasn't going to agree to it. I just… wanted to solve the problem."</p><p>That's all it really was, finding loopholes and solutions and zeroing in on it slightly too fast for common sense to catch up with. There <em> had</em> been solutions, if you regarded the whole thing as a purely intellectual exercise where people would do A if B happened. If 'spare arm' then 'transplant'.</p><p>"Good, that's … very good," Dad said. He sounded relieved.</p><p>Yeah, okay. Now that the rush of planning had faded a bit, I could see how plotting to circumvent the people stopping you from lopping off your own arm was a bit… faulty.</p><p>I wasn't exactly <em> eager</em> to damage myself, no matter what. It wasn't totally not an option, but there were probably better ones that could be explored first.</p><p>"Now what was all that about Shikako's necklace?"</p><p>I hesitated. "If you don't already know, we can't actually tell you," I said, when Shikamaru opened his mouth and looked like he was going to answer.</p><p>I was, at least, a little more used to keeping secrets. From our parents, even.</p><p>Dad narrowed his eyes and I suspected that certain records were going to be examined very closely again tomorrow, before accepting that with a nod. "Is it dangerous?" he asked.</p><p>"No," I said.</p><p>"Yes," Shikamaru said.</p><p>Right, of course. Clearly we agreed on everything in our lives.</p><p>"It killed you!" Shikamaru said, starting to sound a little outraged. Again.</p><p>"It saved me," I countered. Which was probably veering too close to saying too much. "It's not dangerous," I reiterated.</p><p>"I think this is something that the two of you need to sort out," Dad pointed out.</p><p>I looked at him blankly. And how did he think we would do that when we were clearly on opposite sides with neither having any inclination to budge? That sounded like a real productive use of our time.</p><p>"I think we've got bigger things to worry about," I pointed out.</p><p>"Like what?" Shikamaru asked, derisively. "My arm? It's <em> gone.</em> It's not like we can do anything about that."</p><p>"It's not like we can do anything about this, either," I pointed out. Fairly. In my opinion.</p><p>He went dangerously quiet and still, anyway. "It's not like <em> I</em> can, you mean," he said. "You tried to use it. You've <em> been</em> using it."</p><p>That had to be a guess. But he wasn't wrong, so it was an accurate one.</p><p>"It's not dangerous," I said, again, which was probably confirmation in its own way. I was pretty sure that the intention behind that was 'you should stop' and I was just… done listening to this.</p><p>This was old news. Why did we have to keep rehashing this? We had newer things, bigger problems to fry.</p><p><em> Screw your 'we can't do anything', Shikamaru. </em></p><p>"I'm going to R'n'D," I announced, standing. "I've got research to do. Don't wait up for me."</p><p>I stood and walked straight out.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I didn't come up with a solution overnight.</p><p>Hadn't really expected that I could, really, but I'd spent the time scribbling down any hint of idea or knowledge or memory that would let me tackle the problem.</p><p>Transplants were out, obviously. Shikamaru wouldn't take them. Whatever regeneration techniques Kofuku-oba had mentioned were clearly under development already. There was nothing I could do to add to or improve that. But prosthetics… not so obviously dismissed. They couldn't be Hidden Sand ones – even if we could build them, the trick was in operating them.</p><p>It had to be something easy, something that didn't take mastery of a jutsu he didn't have any experience in. Had to be something almost without thought, for best results. Something you didn't have to pay attention to in order to use.</p><p>Kinda like a real arm.</p><p>That was the thing. I was no expert, had never had anything more than a 'that's neat' passing interest in the subject – but I knew that you could build prosthetics that would recognize action potentials and muscle impulses to function <em> just like a real arm did</em> . And maybe my world had still been in the early stages of building those things too – but surely there was a way to do it.</p><p>I had seals. They could substitute for electricity and machinery and operate in ways those never could.</p><p>So yeah, it was a solid avenue to explore.</p><p>At dawn I slipped back to the silent house and started cooking breakfast. Mum was still asleep, more tired than normal these days, and while I couldn't do anything to alleviate the <em> stress</em> that was happening right now I could at least make some things easier on her.</p><p>Granted, it was also much easier to do from this side of dawn, rather than waking up earlier.</p><p>I was still cooking when I sensed a presence approach the door, and since everyone was still asleep, I went to silently open it rather than wait for them to knock.</p><p>"Show off," Ino said, good naturedly. But she hadn't even raised her hand, so she'd obviously felt me coming, too.</p><p>I gave a semi-shrug. "Everyone's still asleep," I said. She looked rough, but not terrible. Not straight-from-a-mission or worried-to-death.</p><p>"Oh." She rubbed a hand across her face. "Of course. I didn't realise it was so early." She grimaced in apology. "I've been up for ages making arrangements for the shop."</p><p>I waved it off. Sometimes when you were awake it seemed like everyone else should be too. "Just means you have to help cook breakfast," I said, motioning her inside.</p><p>"Ah, I see your cunning ploy now," she said, sliding off her sandals and padding after me. But she tied on a spare apron without protest and picked up a knife like it was only natural.</p><p>"Less work for you."</p><p>"You know it," I said, resuming where I left off. "You just get back from your mission?"</p><p>"Yesterday," Ino said. "More like last night. Dad told me all about…" she waved the knife a little loosely. "Stuff. Chouji is probably going to come over early, too."</p><p>"Probably not till after breakfast," I said.</p><p>She huffed, but it sounded like a laugh. "Yeah, probably not. Although if he can get <em> two</em> breakfasts out of it…"</p><p>"Maybe we better make extra," I said, straight faced.</p><p>It was … better. Something about her light and laughter made the kitchen warmer than it had been before.</p><p>By the time Mum had roused and come downstairs, breakfast was mostly ready and we'd even – mostly – tidied up the dishes as well.</p><p>"Oh, good morning dear," she said, surprised. "You're here early."</p><p>"Sorry about that," Ino said, flashing an apologetic smile. "I wanted to see Shikamaru, but I guess I should have figured that that lazy bones wouldn't be up yet."</p><p>Mum hesitated, torn between the usual response of going and rousing him and the way that everyone had been… careful around him recently.</p><p>"It can wait," Ino went on freely, not seeming to notice the moment – but I knew she did. "It gave me time to catch up with Shikako! We haven't done that in ages. We should go to the onsen together or something later on."</p><p>"We should," I agreed, though a little cautiously. That seemed a whole lot like 'we should talk' and that didn't go over well ever. As proven last night.</p><p>"He'll be up soon," Mum said, and accepted the cup of tea I pressed into her hands. "Did your mission go well?"</p><p>"It did!" Ino said cheerfully, then spun off a tale about the antics that Chouji and Shino had gotten up to on the way. I was almost envious but I knew that even from this mission I could spin off a dozen small stories that were equally as harmless – it didn't mean that nothing bad had happened, only that good things had happened too.</p><p>"Actually," I said. "You'll never guess who we ran into at the start of the mission."</p><p>After the exams, the Sand Siblings had to count as 'friends', surely. Besides, I had a feeling Ino would enjoy the improvised theater part.</p><p>I was just wrapping up the retelling when Shikamaru ambled down the stairs. He was rumpled and yawning and still half asleep, and Ino went totally still at the sight of him.</p><p>Then she pounced, launching herself up and across the room in one smooth move to tackle him with a hug.</p><p>"Oomph," he said. Then managed a wheezing, "hi, Ino."</p><p>"I told you to work on your taijutsu!" she said, voice slightly muffled into his neck, going high and shrill. "I told you-" her voice wobbled and broke.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Shikamaru groused. "I should have known you'd be the first one to say 'I told you so'."</p><p>I turned away, letting them have a small modicum of privacy.</p><p>"You're going to have to train so hard to make up for this!" Ino went on. "Don't even think about slacking off!"</p><p>I didn't know if she was just assuming or… if she wanted him to say, one way or the other, what his plans were. I didn't know what his answer was. I turned back, just slightly, so I could watch out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>He groaned. "Leave off, Ino. I'm injured."</p><p>"Not injured enough to get away with a pitiful face like that," she scoffed, pulling back just a little. Enough to give him a baleful stare. "Everyone's being too nice to you, I can tell. Buck up, mister. I'll drag you to the training field myself if I have to."</p><p>He swatted at her, half-heartedly. "I'm working on it. Dad's got a training plan for learning to do the clan jutsu again. It'll just be a matter of getting the seals working one handed."</p><p>"Haku-kun used one handed seals at the exams," Ino said, speculatively. "I bet you anything that Sasuke was watching with his Sharingan."</p><p>Shikamaru made a face at the suggestion of <em> asking Sasuke for help.</em></p><p>"I'll even ask him for you," Ino said, cheerily. "Then you don't even have excuses not to do it."</p><p>"I'm not sure who you're trying to help, me or yourself," Shikamaru grumbled, but let Ino pull him towards the table. "Ouch! Don't pinch me!"</p><p>Okay, I totally bowed to Ino's mastery of the sulky Nara. She was two for two this morning.</p><p>He flumped down at the table, annoyed and irritated, but looking <em> so much</em> like himself again. "Troublesome."</p><p>"Blah, blah," Ino said. "Eat your breakfast."</p><p>He stabbed his chopsticks into the bowl of rice, awkward without being able to pick it up. "So Chouji's back, too?" he asked casually. It fooled no one.</p><p>"Safe and sound," Ino confirmed. "I bet he'll be here soon."</p><p>He was. We only just finished clearing up the breakfast dishes when Chouji was knocking on the door, carrying a picnic basket of food with him.</p><p>"I thought you might be hungry!" he said cheerfully, lifting it high in demonstration. "And mum sent more of that tea for you, Yoshino-san."</p><p>Mum accepted it with thanks and then booted us all unceremoniously outside. It was a perfect day, with just enough clouds to keep Shikamaru entertained.</p><p>I helped Chouji with the basket, less because he needed it and more to keep myself occupied while Ino and Shikamaru ambled slowly along behind us.</p><p>"Don't worry," Chouji said, wrapping an arm around my shoulders out of the blue. "Shikamaru will work it out. He'll know what to do."</p><p>Chouji's faith was as simple and unshakable as the sky itself. Surprising, yet it shouldn't have been. He'd always had that faith, that belief, and I dreaded the day it crumbled.</p><p>I'd thought, maybe, this would be it. That this obvious problem would rock it. There were questions here – about how things would be in the future, about how Team Ten would never be the same again – yet it hadn't.</p><p><em> Shikamaru will work it out.</em></p><p>I didn't know if I could believe like that, but I was grateful to lean on his strength. To trust in his trust, if only for a moment.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm sure he will," I said, and it was unconvincing. But, for once, I didn't have to be.</p><p>We sat.</p><p>Chouji opened the basket, shared out food that the rest of us failed to be interested in, and started eating. Shikamaru stared up at the sky.</p><p>Ino sighed at them both, but closed her eyes and looked relieved.</p><p>I tried not to fidget and started plucking at the grass on the ground. The silence stretched. Out and out and out. How many days had been exactly like this for us? And yet, not the same at all.</p><p>I could feel the time slipping away, wasted. There was so much I could be doing, instead. And yet I remained rooted to the spot, unable to leave. I hadn't even brought my notebook with me, and it seemed… seemed like I couldn't go and get it. Like leaving would break the fragile peace.</p><p>Like Shikamaru would <em> definitely</em> say something.</p><p>I didn't want to start that fight again. So I was stuck.</p><p>"So, Shikamaru," Ino said, almost slyly. "How's Tenten?"</p><p>Shikamaru groaned and threw his forearm over his eyes in a move that was slightly detrimental to cloud watching. "Go away, Ino."</p><p>"It's perfectly normal to inquire about your <em> girlfriend</em> ," she said, which told me that Ino had greatly relished being able to tease him.</p><p>He made a non-committal grunting noise.</p><p>"How's she taken it?" Ino asked, grin fading slightly. She glanced at me, eyes communicating the worry that there was a line here she had crossed.</p><p>I gave a half-hearted shrug. Tenten had dropped by a few times. But Shika had been… uncommunicative. And she wasn't Ino, to bully her way in and make him listen. Well. She might have been, if we'd been somewhere that was more even ground (somewhere not-our-house, basically, where she still seemed slightly uncomfortable sometimes, and more so when Dad was home) but they'd been stilted visits.</p><p>"She does <em> know</em> , doesn't she?" Ino prodded.</p><p>"Yes," Shikamaru sounded like he was rolling his eyes. "She's fine with it. Told me to let her know if I wanted to train. There's nothing for you to shove your nose into."</p><p>Ino gave him an exaggerated offended look. "I don't shove my nose into things," she said. "I am friendly and supportive and always willing to help you with things you are stupid at, and you should appreciate that."</p><p>"I'm not stupid at things," he retorted, rising to her bait. "You just like to meddle. Leave it alone, Ino."</p><p>She frowned at him, something serious lurking just behind the façade.</p><p>"Don't fight," Chouji said, interrupting them. He held a bag of chips as a peace offering. "You should have something to eat. Healing takes a lot of energy!"</p><p>"We just had breakfast!" Ino objected. "And healing needs <em> healthy</em> food. Honestly!"</p><p>I sat back and listened to them bicker.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The day drained away slowly and, although I was tired, once we'd all said goodnight I found myself unable to sleep.</p><p>I blinked up at the ceiling of my room and gave it up for a bad job.</p><p>I got up, redressed and left the house. Might as well get something useful done.</p><p>"Another late night," Takatori said, when I arrived at the research library. His eyebrows lifted in a way that conveyed <em> meaning.</em></p><p>I wasn't in the mood for it. "Lots to do," I said, verging on the edge of polite shortness. I flicked though my notes from last night and started pulling out material to work on.</p><p>People came and went as I worked and late night ticked over to early morning. It was productive. I felt like I was getting somewhere. I'd filled pages and pages full of brainstorms. Now it was simply a matter of getting it to work.</p><p>I went home in good cheer, planning to make breakfast again. But when I got there, Shikamaru's chakra wasn't placidly sleeping. It was buzzing, hard and awake and in my room.</p><p>I stared at the ceiling and contemplated – just for a second! – ignoring it. I'd maybe get away with it. If I couldn't sense chakra, there was no way I could know he was up there.</p><p>Then I dragged myself to the stairs and went to see what he wanted.</p><p>"You were gone," he said, fist wrapped in my sheets and crinkling them. I'd even put the effort into making them lie flat, too. "Where were you?" It sounded accusing.</p><p>I paused in the doorway, suddenly so, so tired. I didn't want to fight with him. Again. Ever. "R&amp;D," I said, truthfully. "I woke up early; had some ideas. Didn't think you'd be up for a while."</p><p>Mostly truthfully, anyway. 'Early' sounded better than 'all night'. It was probably better this way, anyway. Then I could be here with him during the day.</p><p>It was what everyone wanted.</p><p>His fingers uncurled. "Right," he said, taking a steading breath. "Yeah. Okay. Let's get breakfast started?"</p><p>The day went pretty much like the one before it. And so did the next. And the next.</p><p>"You look <em> awful,</em> " Ino said, examining me critically.</p><p>"Thanks," I said dryly. She probably wasn't wrong. Spending all night researching gave me a lot of time, but not a lot of sleep. Chakra helped there, but it was starting to show. "That's so sweet of you."</p><p>"Hmph. I'm declaring this mandatory onsen time," she said. "Rest and relaxation only. You need it."</p><p>"Now?" I asked, blinking at her. "But I – I should stay." Stay with Shikamaru, went unsaid but obvious.</p><p>Ino's eyes shifted over the boys, calculating. It was more than clear they didn't want to move at all. "They can come with us," she proposed, and nudged my brother with her toe. "Get up. We're going."</p><p>Shikamaru wiggled his shoulders, like he was trying to sink deeper into the grass. "Not a chance," he grunted. "You go. Me and Chouji are staying right here."</p><p>Chouji ate his chips and pretended that he wasn't in the middle of a Shikamaru and Ino squabbling match. He probably would have been perfectly happy with either outcome, because that was Chouji.</p><p>"Alright," I said resigned, because that was that, wasn't it. "To the onsen."</p><p>"You sound so <em> thrilled</em> ," Ino said, deadpan. "Lighten up, would you?"</p><p>I had, a bit, by the time we were relaxing into the hot water. It wasn't that I didn't want to be here, or want to be here with Ino… it was just that…</p><p><em> He'll need you</em> , Dad had said. <em> You should stay.</em> And staying hadn't helped and no one wanted me too and I didn't know what I was supposed to <em> do…</em></p><p>"So, you look dead on your feet," Ino said. "How are you, really? Is it about Shikamaru?"</p><p>I made a half-hearted noise of 'sort of'. "I've been doing some research. Looking into prosthetics. That sort of thing."</p><p>"Oh?" She asked, interested but not expectant. "How's that working out?"</p><p>"Not well," I admitted. It was true. I was running into more hurdles than I had solutions for and bullheaded optimism was only taking me so far. "It's… complicated."</p><p>"I bet," she agreed. "Can I help?"</p><p>I laughed and the short bitterness of it surprised even me. "I don't know. I don't even know how to start. I have all these ideas that <em> should work</em> and I just can't… can't get them to connect. They're years ahead of anything we're currently doing."</p><p>"And years ahead of you too, huh?" she said, gently. Hitting right on the nail of the problem. "Nothing like this ever gets made in a week, you know. Research takes time. Inventing stuff takes time."</p><p>"If I had years," I started and the shook my head, splashing water gently. "But I need it <em> now,</em> " I said helplessly.</p><p>"You don't need it now," Ino said, then charged on before I could protest. "Shikamaru does."</p><p>"It's the same," I said.</p><p>"No it's not," she countered. "You guys got over being joined at the hip when you graduated. It was good for you. And now you're… quiet and sad all the time."</p><p>I shrugged, unable to answer. Not really. "Things are just going back to the way they were."</p><p>But her eyes were sharp. Compassionate and kind, yes, but sharp. I tried not to feel like this was an interrogation. It was the wrong setting for it entirely – it seemed ridiculous to picture an interrogation when we were both only wearing towels. "Maybe it wasn't good for you then, either," she said. "But it's really not good for you now. Have you even been to see Sakura since you got home? Or Sasuke? Anyone? Gone training?"</p><p>None of those were a 'yes'.</p><p>We both knew it.</p><p>"I don't know what to do," I admitted, voice achingly small. Small and tired. God, I was so tired. "I don't know how to fix it – to make it better. He's hurting and I can't help." I looked at her. "I tried to save his arm but I couldn't. And he doesn't want a transplant to get a new one. And I didn't even know if he wanted to stay a field ninja because he's not talking to me anymore… maybe we never talked but it just didn't matter before. And now we don't know how."</p><p>It spilled out, unintentional. But now I'd started and there was no taking it back.</p><p>"Not talking at all?" Ino asked, raising her head, just a little.</p><p>"Arguing, mostly," I said with a bit of a lopsided smile. "Not really about his arm or the mission or anything like that; it's been going on for a while. About…when I got hurt."</p><p>"Typical," Ino said, with just a touch of humour to lighten the situation. "You both worry about each other more than you worry about yourselves."</p><p>I snorted. "Yeah, well. I got better. He didn't. And yet somehow he thinks mine was the bigger issue."</p><p>"It was… more serious, wasn't it?" Ino said, carefully and non-judgmentally.</p><p>"I got better," I repeated, which was a deflection and yet not at the same time. "It <em> doesn't matter.</em> It happened and it's over. It's in the past. Move on."</p><p>I felt like Rafiki. <em> It's in the past. </em> Everything was in the past. You accepted it, or you didn't, but it wasn't going to change.</p><p>"It's not quite so simple," Ino said.</p><p>"I know," I said, waving a hand and splashing water around. "I know. It makes things change. But things are always changing. We can't – we can't go <em> back</em> ."</p><p>Stupid, simple words that never quite summed up the whole of it. You couldn't turn back the clock. You couldn't undo things that had happened, even if you wanted to. You couldn't get back the world you lost.</p><p>"I know," Ino said, blinking her serpentine eyes at me. "And trying to is only making you unhappy, isn't it? You're trying to be Shikako-from-the-Academy for him now and it's… it's not working."</p><p>"I don't know what else to do," I repeated, and hugged my arms around my knees. "He wants it back and I don't want to fight and I can't-" I couldn't sum up all the things I couldn't do. My voice choked out.</p><p>"Then you have to tell him that," she said, gentle but firm. "And let him tell you whatever it is he's thinking. Maybe neither of you changes, but you have to talk. Talk and not fight."</p><p>Like it was easy. Like every time we tried it didn't end up as a fight.</p><p>"I'm not some endless dispenser of comfort and patience," I said, drawing on a flash of annoyance to articulate it. "Why is it <em> me</em> that has to be the bigger person and keep calm all the time?"</p><p>There was an edge of resentment I tried not to let show. The feeling of when people asked more than I could give, more than I was willing to give. And I was… I was just so tired, sometimes, in ways that had nothing to do with pulling all-nighters doing research. Ways that just went straight down past the bone.</p><p>But the annoyance faded. Because it had to be me, obviously. Because I was the adult, the one who had set myself up as the one people went to for help. I couldn't just retract it because I was tired.</p><p>I sighed, long and low.</p><p>"Hey," Ino said. "It'll be okay. You'll get through this. Just because things are different doesn't mean they'll be bad. And I think Shikamaru is working that out too. Just give him a bit of time – he's dumb, sometimes. I think he's just worried that you don't <em> want</em> to go back; that you don't… that you don't cherish what you used to have as much as he does. That you're trying to move away more than you're trying to move on."</p><p>I huffed a laugh that wasn't really about mirth. "I'm not trying to leave him. I want to keep him safe. I want to keep him happy. It's all about that, don't you see? I just… I don't know how to fix it."</p><p>"That's what you need to tell him," she said and reached out to squeeze my hand. "He only wants the same for you."</p><p><em> And that's why we're arguing,</em> I thought but didn't say.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We got back to the Nara household to find another guest, this one slightly unexpected.</p><p>"Asuma-sensei!" Ino said brightly. "You're back from your mission!"</p><p>He had challenged – or been challenged by – Shikamaru for a game of shogi. The board was fairly even at this stage and I could see more than a few strategies in the works on both sides.</p><p>"Are we going to have some team training?" Ino asked, dropping down to sit on the veranda.</p><p>Asuma puffed on his cigarette. "No," he said, quietly. "I don't think there would be much point."</p><p>There was a spell of silence. Not quite disbelief but an edge of 'maybe he didn't mean it like that'.</p><p>"What?" Shikamaru asked, looking slightly confused. "I thought you were here to suggest it."</p><p>Asuma took his cigarette and tapped the ash off into the ash tray. Tap, tap, tap. "You didn't ask," he pointed out. "You've never asked for training. And that's why it would be pointless."</p><p>"You don't think I can do it?" Shikamaru asked, confusion giving way to just the barest flicker of hurt.</p><p>I looked away. He'd trusted Asuma's faith in him like he'd trusted Chouji's. <em> I</em> had trusted Asuma's faith in him. He'd known how smart Shikamaru was, how <em> good</em> , before he'd ever done anything to deserve it.</p><p>And now he was saying…</p><p>"You're a genius, Shikamaru. I think you could do anything you set your mind to," Asuma said, which would have been support except it wasn't. It was damming. "And that's the problem, isn't it?"</p><p>"I-" Shikamaru said and faltered.</p><p>"This isn't a simple injury," Asuma said. "It's not going to be easy to overcome. Especially not if you want to surpass the level you were at before. I am <em> absolutely certain</em> that you could do it – if you wanted to. That's what I'm not so sure about. And that's what matters, right now. You're going to have to work harder than you ever have before. And that's not something that other people can do for you."</p><p>I looked at Ino. She didn't look like she had expected to hear any of this, either.</p><p>"Your intelligence could still take you a long way," Asuma went on. "You'd make Special Jounin for tactics easily enough. But not in the field. And not with Team Ten."</p><p>Ino looked gob smacked. "Asuma-sensei!"</p><p>He gave her a half smile. "I'm not making a ruling," he said. "I'm not kicking him off the team. I don't have that power, not anymore. What I'm saying is this; if you can't fill your role on the team, then the team won't be deployed. If you can't keep up with Ino and Chouji, then you'll be dragging them down. And right now… you can't."</p><p>Something cold gripped the spaces around my heart and filled them up.</p><p><em> You'll let your team down.</em> The most damning kind of words in Konoha.</p><p>And he wasn't wrong. If Shikamaru couldn't do something, Ino and Chouji would do everything they could to make up for it. And that would be extra strain on them, two sides of a triangle holding up the third, and that was dangerous.</p><p>"I won't," Shikamaru said, staring down at the shogi board. "I won't let them down."</p><p>"It's not going to be easy," Asuma repeated. "And there's only so much we can do to help you. It's going to come down to <em> you</em> , Shikamaru. And how much you're willing to do."</p><p>"I said I won't let them down," Shikamaru repeated back, a bite of irritation in his voice. "You said I could do it if I decided to. Well, I'm deciding to."</p><p>Asuma leant back like that was all he'd ever wanted. It probably was. He clearly didn't want Shikamaru to <em> give up</em> on being a ninja, or anything silly like that.</p><p>But the game had changed. It was more serious now. And maybe Shikamaru needed to see that. Or – no. I was sure he saw it. Death was a real possibility and had been for quite some time. People broke into our homes. We got hurt.</p><p>We had to step up what we were <em> doing</em> about it.</p><p>It didn't seem right, after that, to bring up a conversation that was sure to lead to a fight. Nor the next day, when Dad invoked clan training.</p><p>"It should <em> work,</em> " Shikamaru said, fed up and completely frustrated after an hour of trying to get even the simplest of shadow jutsu working without seals. "I know <em> how</em> to do it<em> .</em> "</p><p>He sounded mutinous, as if betrayed by his own failure.</p><p>"Mm," I said, instead of repeating the spiel about the properties of handseals and how ninja experienced in certain jutsu could do away with them. We'd almost been up to that stage with Shadow Possession Jutsu – only the Rat Seal at the end.</p><p>He knew it all. He was just frustrated.</p><p>"You'll get there," Dad said. "You just have to relearn it for your new circumstances. Don't try and force it. There's no hurry."</p><p>The thing with being smart was that you weren't used to <em> not getting it.</em> Even when we'd learnt this for the first time, we'd got it. It hadn't exactly been easy but we hadn't struggled either. Not the way that some people struggled to learn things.</p><p>It probably wasn't the same even now, it was just things suddenly seemed so <em> daunting.</em></p><p>I left Shikamaru to it and started working on the Shadow Neckbind Jutsu. It hadn't been my focus – I'd seen far more use in the Shadow Stitching tendrils and their solidity rather than the pseudo-hand of the Neckbind.</p><p>Now the opposite was true. Or rather… a mixture of the both was true. The three dimensional solidity of Shadow Stitching, combined with the shape and control of the Neckbind…</p><p>Dad was watching me closely.</p><p>After a seconds hesitation, I ran the idea past him. He was experienced – not just in the clan style but in creating them, altering them. And there was no reason to keep this secret, no reason to not ask for his opinion on how to make it work.</p><p>Sometimes it felt like I was juggling too many knives, unsure which ones I could let go of.</p><p>"Hmm," Dad mused, thoughtfully. "Not a bad plan. How long can you hold the Stitching Jutsu for?"</p><p>"Not long," I admitted. They were created to stab something, to thrust and maybe to tie it down afterwards, not to be held for a long time. Though even Shadow Possession would only last a matter of minutes. I'd have to find some way to exceed that kind of limit, without increasing chakra or putting excessive strain on my concentration.</p><p><em> I could anchor it to a seal</em> …</p><p>That might help keep it going, but I'd still have to have a jutsu to work with first. Actually, that might help the chakra drain, too, if it just… recycled the same chakra instead of having to be activated and then lost. It would be like my lightsaber, in a way.</p><p>It would still take a lot of concentration to control – but not to hold or to keep going. It wouldn't be as good as a real arm, a thing you could move without paying attention, but it would be something.</p><p><em> If I can make it work.</em></p><p>And if I couldn't manage to combine Neckbind and Stitching, surely my Shadow State could provide some kind of inspiration.</p><p>After training, I expected Shikamaru to go back to the Shogi board, but he didn't. He marched grimly out of the compound and towards the training field.</p><p>I fell into step behind him, even though he'd said nothing and hadn't asked me to come. It was natural by this point, an old habit I hadn't realized I'd broken.</p><p>I knew the place as we got closer, and wasn't surprised to find Tenten there practicing her aim. There was a whole host of targets peppered with an assortment of weapons – not all of them meant for throwing.</p><p>"Hey, Tenten," Shikamaru said, as casually as he could muster. "You still up for that training?"</p><p>She greeted him with a bright smile and enthusiasm.</p><p>I let them be, hanging back. Lee was here too, working on punching a training log to death. I probably shouldn't interrupt that.</p><p>Instead, I went through a series of stretches, warming up thoroughly because I'd done nothing since returning home. It felt good to get back into it, to start moving again.</p><p>But I could watch Shikamaru and Tenten as they too warmed up and began to spar. It was clear, for the first time, how awkward Shikamaru was in his skin – how much his ability to fight was affected. Even just in this, the barest of taijutsu with only kunai involved, he had to work twice as hard to fend her off. Tenten wasn't exactly going easy on him, but she was working out his limits and new weakness, quick and probing, finding the places he could and couldn't reach in time to defend.</p><p>Shikamaru wasn't a taijutsu fighter – wasn't short range – but it was still the foundation of any ninja fight. He would be in trouble, if it came down to it.</p><p>"Shikako-san," Lee said, and I tore my eyes away from their fight to meet his inquisitive gaze. "Are you also looking for a sparring partner?"</p><p>I hadn't been, but the offer was good. Too good to pass up. It would absolutely, one hundred percent, <em> suck</em> because I was not on Lee's level… but it was too good to pass up.</p><p>"I would be honoured," I said.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of the Moon Arc: Chapter 118</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: The DOS reddit is now open. We're holding an AMA / Q&amp;A on the 2nd of April, 6pm EST.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 118</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Action may not always bring happiness; but there is no happiness without action. ~ B</em> <em> enjamin Disraeli</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Just to confirm," I said. "If I make a single seal, for field use, and gift it to a single shinobi <em> who understands what it is</em> , then I don't have to have it approved by R&amp;D, right?"</p><p>I leant against the doorframe to Kofuku-oba's office. Doorframes were my friends, these days. And walls. And people who stood still long enough. Being upright took so much unnecessary effort.</p><p>Kofuku-oba looked up at me. She'd probably been here all of five minutes, and I did not feel bad about that at all. She was here early, I was here late, everything worked out. Tada.</p><p>"Who are you giving it to?" she asked, with what almost sounded like trepidation.</p><p>"Shikamaru," I said impatiently. <em> Keep up.</em> <em> What else have I been working on?</em> "I can do that, right?"</p><p>I didn't want to get caught up in this bullshit again. Not a turf war I was interested in participating, especially when 'replacement for arm' could <em> maybe</em> be stretched as a medical intervention. Not that it was.</p><p>Kofuku-oba laced her fingers together. "I'm afraid I need a little more information than that, Shikako," she said carefully. "What kind of seal are we talking about, here?"</p><p>I huffed. "For his arm," I said. But I knew I wasn't being particularly clear so it wasn't fair to get so annoyed at her. My clan wasn't the one composed of mind readers.</p><p>But demonstrating was easier than explaining. I lifted the square of paper in my right hand and channeled chakra into it. A dark shadow extended up, solid and three dimensional, and formed a hand.</p><p>I made it wave.</p><p>Comparing it to my lightsaber had been a good plan – it was a jutsu anchored to a seal that could be turned on and off at will, repeatedly, with little expenditure of chakra. But it could also be controlled once it was out, the same way I could launch huge swathes of lightning around. Well, more finely controlled than that. Much more finely controlled.</p><p>I'd had trouble with the jutsu at first – creating something from the combination of two other jutsu wasn't easy. But then …</p><p>Well, I already had a shadow hand, didn't I? It was just attached to the rest of a shadow <em> me.</em></p><p>Probably not the best way to put it, if I was to ever explain how I'd come up with this. Especially give the way the last conversation about arms had gone. I hadn't sealed it or done anything like that. I'd just used it as a template for what I wanted the seal to be – the density, strength, construction, size and shape… all so much easier to describe and analyse when I had something to base it off of. I'd copied it.</p><p>It would still need fine tuning. For a long time to come, probably. But it was the kind of fine tuning that would need to be done with Shikamaru, would need someone to <em> use it</em> to figure out the limits and weaknesses.</p><p>"It'll go on a thing," I said, vaguely, waving the paper about sloppily. The technique collapsed back into it. "So he can wear it."</p><p>"How-" Kofuku-oba said, rising out of her desk. "I really think that <em> does</em> need to be examined."</p><p>"It's not medical," I objected, fingers tightening on the paper. I could see the quick resolution spiraling out of reach. Once it got caught up in testing it would be there <em> forever.</em> "And I'm not selling them. You don't <em> need</em> to test it."</p><p>Kofuku heaved a sigh like I was being entirely unreasonable. But everything she did would hold it up and make it take longer to get to Shikamaru. That was the whole <em> point.</em></p><p>"There would be a lot of demand for a reliable prosthetic," she said, patiently.</p><p>"It's a clan jutsu," I rebutted, because I'd actually thought of that. It was still a <em> jutsu</em> . "It requires ability to manipulate shadow natured chakra. No one else would be able to use it."</p><p>"And you think your brother is the only one in the clan to have been injured, do you?" she shot back.</p><p>My fingers gripped the seal even tighter. "It's for Shikamaru," I said. And if she wanted to give it to someone else then she could pry it from my cold, dead hands.</p><p><em> I should have just given it to him and asked for forgiveness later.</em></p><p>"I'm not saying otherwise," Kofuku said. "But I'm asking if there's no reason we can't make more. Besides," she switched tactics, "you don't want to give your brother something that isn't <em> safe</em> , do you?"</p><p>I glowered at her almost resentfully. She was winning.</p><p>She was going to win and I'd known that before I'd even set foot in her office. That didn't mean I liked it. But the conditions of victory were just as important as the victory itself.</p><p>"Shikamaru gets to be involved in the testing," I said, flatly. I could have edged around it, manipulated the conversation into going the places I wanted, into getting the concessions I wanted… but I was too tired. I was too goddamn tired and I didn't want very much.</p><p>"He's not exactly… qualified," Kofuku-oba said delicately, after a long moment of surprise. "I know you've worked with him on seals before but-"</p><p>"It's his arm," I said. "So if you want to test it, you do it with him or not at all."</p><p>Once he had it – they couldn't take it away. Not really. Not unless it was horrifically, terribly wrong. Not unless everyone agreed unanimously.</p><p>Kofuku-oba could tie this down for months with testing – but I could turn this into a shitshow too. Thanks to the Logistics Storage Scroll Nightmare, no one doubted that. And <em> Shikamaru</em> was exactly the kind of thing I would do it over.</p><p>No one was going to call my bluff. I wasn't even sure I was bluffing.</p><p>That might have been the reason.</p><p>I blinked, slowly. My head felt very heavy.</p><p>"Very well," Kofuku-oba said crisply after the silence had stretched on and on. "Submit your notes by tomorrow morning and I shall organize a preliminary review of it."</p><p>I nodded and, pushed off from the doorframe, stepping into her office for the first time during the conversation. My ankle rolled, poorly placed and I stumbled but righted myself – still it was the kind of physical error I'd have never made at full capacity. It was glaringly obvious.</p><p>I set my notes down on her desk. They were a haphazard jumble, shorthand scribbled in margins, ideas that had never gone anywhere, missing intuitive leaps of logic that I'd never written down. I'd probably have to come back and make a proper summary at some point, should have before handing it in, but I'd wanted to be <em> done</em> so badly.</p><p>"Thank you for your help," I said distantly and turned myself right back around to go home. And sleep.</p><p>It had been a long couple of weeks.</p><p>I'd done it willingly, voluntarily – against better judgement, even – but there was no denying that the schedule had taken its toll on me. I was glad to be finished with it.</p><p>"Up early again?" Shikamaru asked, voice and body language straining for neutrality as I sank down to the table for breakfast.</p><p>I propped my chin in my hand and looked at him through half lidded eyes. "Mm," I agreed, because I didn't have the energy to argue. Didn't know what he wanted to argue about, but didn't much care either. "I finished it."</p><p>"Finished what?" Dad asked, after the pause where they tried to work out what I'd just said.</p><p>"Hand," I said, descriptively. "Thingy. For Shikamaru."</p><p>Why did people assume I would have been working on anything else? Especially dad, who <em> knew</em> what I was trying to do. Who had been helping me with it.</p><p>"You've been practicing the jutsu?" Dad asked, carefully setting down his chopsticks. "Without supervision?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>"No," I said, not mumbling this time. "I still can't do it. Don't need to though. I worked out how to describe it for the seal. It should work. I gave it to Kofuku-oba for testing – she wants Shikamaru there to trial it tomorrow."</p><p>Well. 'Wants' was an exaggeration.</p><p>"Wait," Shikamaru said. "<em> What</em> have you been working on?"</p><p>I looked at him, puzzled. "A prosthetic arm," I said, slowly. It hadn't exactly been a secret. And I'd worked on the shadow part around him at training. "Well. It's not really a prosthetic. I couldn't get that part working. Yet. It's basically just that Shadow Hand jutsu tied to a seal – kinda like my sword. You just turn it on and off."</p><p>He'd get it when he saw it. It wasn't complicated.</p><p>Shikamaru looked conflicted. "You didn't need to do that," he said. "I can- I'll learn how to do it myself. I will. You didn't need to… to make it <em> easier</em> for me."</p><p>I stared at him. That was weird. He was complaining about having to do less work? Maybe Asuma-sensei's 'train harder' speech had done something to his brain.</p><p>Maybe it was a pride thing?</p><p>"Well," I said, after a very long and bewildered pause. "You don't have to use it if you don't want to. But it exists now. So. Your choice. But, uh, at least go and do the testing because otherwise Kofuku-oba is going to be really annoyed at me. Like. Really."</p><p><em> Especially</em> since I'd blown all her good will in getting it into his hands in the first place.</p><p>"I don't want you to run off and try and <em> fix</em> <em> it,</em> " Shikamaru went on, almost desperately. "I just want you here."</p><p>"I <em> am</em> here," I said, the edge of exasperation growing inside me. "I've <em> been</em> here. Every day. And I didn't fix it. I'm sorry but I can't fix it, okay? All I can do is try to make it a little less bad."</p><p>He grimaced, clearly not happy with my response, and pushed back from the table. He ran his hand through his hair. "I'm going to go find Ino," he muttered. "Get some sleep or something."</p><p>He stalked out the door.</p><p>I sighed, and thought about getting up and following like I had every day since we'd come home. But that had been a pretty clear dismissal. "Yeah, whatever," I said, like he could still hear me.</p><p>Dad cleared his throat. "I'll speak with Kofuku about the seal," he said, as though the conversation were still about me developing it in the first place. Still, that was as good as a guarantee that it would be prioritized.</p><p>"Thanks," I said, gratefully. I couldn't make Shika use it if he didn't want to, but at least it would be there if he did.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Kofuku-oba had really pulled out all the stops. By the time Shikamaru and I got to the R&amp;D building the next morning, there was already a flurry of activity taking place. One of the spare labs had been converted into a makeshift office – conference room? – with pages and pages of my notes spread out across the benches and half a dozen people working hard on them.</p><p>I felt possibly a little bad about forcing everyone to work in a rush, but not really.</p><p>"Shikako!" Kofuku said, clicking her fingers in my direction. "Come over here and explain this."</p><p>I ambled towards her, Shikamaru following half a step behind and looking around curiously. He nodded in greeting to a few of the people. He was probably on friendlier terms with them than I was at this point.</p><p>"Maybe just start from the beginning," she amended, looking down at the pages in front of her. "Half of these are groundbreaking, half of them are complete rubbish."</p><p>I nodded, ruefully. Fair enough. "Okay," I said and cleared my throat. The room went unnecessarily still as everyone stopped to listen. Oh, it was a speech then. Joy. "Right. So. The Shadow Hand jutsu itself is a three dimensional physical manifestation technique. It's … uh, currently in development with Shikaku Nara." I nodded. That made it sound legitimate and official. "It has aspects from both the Shadow Neckbind Jutsu and Shadow Stitching Jutsu. It's short range but shadow-dense and has a high degree of flexibility and precision."</p><p>"About that-" a lady near the back of the room interrupted.</p><p>Kofuku waved her silent. "Wait till the end, Nanto," she said. "Let's keep this orderly."</p><p>"Um," I said, slightly derailed. "The Jutsu itself is anchored to a… a recycling seal. That is… the chakra used to maintain the jutsu is retained by the seal and reused during the next activation. There is, of course, a minimal chakra bleed off but at least eighty percent of the jutsu cost should be offset by the seal. Um. In order to trigger the jutsu, the chakra input has to exceed the activation barrier – which is chakra that cannot be retained by the seal."</p><p>I paused. That was really it, actually. It had been ridiculously complicated to make for something that sounded so simple at the end.</p><p>People kept staring at me, silently. I shifted my weight. "Yeah. Um. You had questions?"</p><p>Turns out, there were a lot of questions. Kofuku-oba herded them into some kind of order.</p><p>"You said the technique was flexible and precise," Nanto said first, picking up where she'd wanted to interrupt before. "But we've been unable to actually mobilise it." She gestured to the seal sitting on the front table.</p><p>I nodded. "Um. Well. The seal only <em> creates</em> the jutsu. It's still controlled by the user the same way that other shadow jutsu are. It requires concentration and familiarity to … to use it to its fullest potential."</p><p>I took a hesitant step over to the seal and activated it. I could make it bend and wave but it clearly wasn't as smooth and natural as a real motion would have been. "That's why I wanted Shikamaru to be involved in the testing from the start," I said. "Because there's going to be a heavy learning curve before it's useful for fine motor tasks."</p><p>"What about the original jutsu?" Nanto said. "Can we compare the two?"</p><p>I shrugged, a little. "Uh, you'd have to get dad to demonstrate it. I can't perform that technique. I only managed to describe it for the seal."</p><p>Yeah, let's go with that.</p><p>She didn't look happy with the answer, but subsided. There was someone else to pick up the slack and ask questions, anyway.</p><p>"The size of it," someone asked next. "It seems too small for its intended purpose."</p><p>I frowned. "I only had my own hands to base it on," I objected. "The size can be adjusted easily enough – the only problems will be if the density and chakra requirements need to be recalculated."</p><p><em> Rude.</em></p><p>"Can it be altered for, say, a leg replacement then?"</p><p>"Probably?" I guessed. "I mean, it's intended to be combat capable so it should be strong enough to be weight bearing."</p><p>There were more technical questions after that. How often could it be used? How long could it be used for? Would the seals degrade? How did the jutsu react to light sources? What if this? What if that?</p><p>"There shouldn't be a limit to how <em> long</em> the jutsu can be active for, as long as the user can sustain the concentration and chakra to maintain it. Or how often," I said. And then was mostly reduced to shrugging helplessly and saying 'probably' a lot. Seals didn't really <em> degrade</em> as such but they could get a little… funny with chakra running through them constantly.</p><p>No one ended up satisfied and that was just the <em> start</em> of the testing.</p><p><hr /></p><p>It was still nearly a full week later before I was called to the missions desk for an assignment. It was late, after sun down, when the messenger knocked on the door and told me to get to the tower ASAP.</p><p>I stared at him, distinctly aware I was wearing pajama's and was in no way field ready – and then flew up the stairs to fix that. I wrestled myself into my field gear, peeked quickly into my pack and thanked god for paranoia that made me keep it ready at all times.</p><p>I pretended I didn't see the sudden tightening on Shikamaru's face. Even he couldn't say anything to an official summons.</p><p>"I know you haven't officially returned to active duty," the chunin on duty said apologetically. "But this is a really urgent one and you're the highest ranking Sensor Squad ninja in the village."</p><p>I hadn't even realized I needed to request a return to active duty – I wasn't on medical leave – though in hindsight that really explained why I'd had so much downtime to work on the seal. Was there some kind of 'oops I screwed up' leave? Maybe it was unofficial.</p><p>"It's fine," I said. "Mark me down as back on duty. What's the situation?"</p><p>I was handed a mission scroll. "Missing child from Mori-gai," he said promptly. "Daughter of the ambassador. Last seen in the morning, but the alarm wasn't raised until around six. Searchers were deployed but couldn't find her and at sundown they sent a hawk for us. The initial assumption is that she wandered into the forest and got lost."</p><p>She could have been missing for nearly twelve hours, then, which was plenty of time for harm to befall a child, natural or otherwise. Overnight would be worse, with dropping temperatures inviting hypothermia, or predators, or simply wandering around in the dark and getting injured.</p><p>"No scent trackers in the village?" I asked. Scent tracking beat chakra sense by a mile at things like this.</p><p>"None above chunin," he said, pulling forward a list of Sensor Squad ninja.</p><p>Frankly, a Chunin Inuzuka would be better at this mission than Special Jounin me, but I didn't comment on his selection criteria. It was hardly the time.</p><p>I ran a quick glance over it. "I'll take Kiba with me," I decided, near instantly. It might have been a mistake – I hadn't talked to him since our last mission had ended on a sour note – but I had complete faith in his abilities as a tracker. Even if he hated me, he could find a missing child.</p><p>Whatever else was going on, the mission came first.</p><p>I held onto that thought as I made my way into the Inuzuka compound. Hana answered the door when I knocked, looking vaguely annoyed but also prepared to spring into action if so required.</p><p>"I need Kiba for a mission," I said, holding up the scroll. "It's urgent. Sorry."</p><p>She shrugged and disappeared out of the doorway. After a second, I heard the distinct sound of his name being bellowed down a hallway. In an impressively short span of time, Kiba was out the door and ready to go.</p><p>He paused a fraction at seeing me, but said nothing.</p><p>I hoped that was good enough. "I'll brief you as we go," I said, leading the way towards the gates.</p><p>"Piece of cake," Kiba said confidently, once I'd filled him in. "Me and Akamaru will find her in no time."</p><p>Akamaru gave a supportive bark.</p><p>"That's what I thought," I said. "I figured if we pushed the pace now, we could have her home safe and sound by morning."</p><p>He gave me a fanged smirk. "You call this pushing it?"</p><p>I speed up. So did he. It was still a sustainable pace, still nothing that would tire us out – just in case – but every minute we shaved off our time here counted.</p><p>"Look," I said, breaking the silence that fell between us. "About our last mission…"</p><p>It was hard to gauge anyone's reaction when you were travelling side by side at a breakneck pace through the trees, but his shoulders stiffened.</p><p>"I'm sorry," I said quickly, turning my face forward. "That I put you in that kind of position. You made the right call trying to get everyone out of there."</p><p>Kiba snorted. "No, I didn't," he said. "It was wrong. You managed to do whatever the hell it was you did and saved the day. I should have trusted you."</p><p>"It wasn't about trust," I said, because those had been his words. And he'd been right. "And that doesn't change the fact that it was the right call, to look after the client and the team."</p><p>Give that exact situation as an Academy exam question, and no one would ever pick what I had done as the correct answer.</p><p>"You can make all the right calls and fail, and all the wrong calls and win," I said, struggling to articulate what I wanted. "I won but… I risked a lot. If those ninja had gone after you instead of all staying at the castle…"</p><p>If they'd gone after my team. If I hadn't beaten them both. If I'd been injured too. If. If. If. There were a lot of ways that that could have gone badly.</p><p>"So I think you made the right call," I said. "And I think… if we were there again you would still make the same one."</p><p>Kiba was silent for a long minute. "So would you," he said. "You'd still go."</p><p>I paused. "Yeah," I agreed. "I'd still go."</p><p>He barked a laugh, but it didn't sound amused. "How does that even work? You say you're wrong, but you'd still do it. You say I was right, but you still wouldn't listen."</p><p>I huffed, a noise that wasn't quite a laugh either. "If you haven't noticed that I'm a raging hypocrite by now then I'm won't be the one to shatter your illusions."</p><p>He shook his head, but my attempt at levity seemed to have managed to do <em> something</em> to the situation.</p><p>"You're a jerk," he said in mock-disgust. "There we were, all worried about little old you, and you just took on two maybe-jounin like it wasn't the first time."</p><p>"Well," I said, then stopped.</p><p>"Liar," Kiba accused, then squinted at me. "For serious? How come they kicked our ass so bad the first time then?"</p><p>"How come you didn't go Fang-Wolf-Fang?" I pointed out. "Way too much friendly fire when you're not fighting alone. Besides, the plan was to stall them and not jump straight into the 'try kill them' part. And yeah, maybe that was just a flaw in the plan but… killing isn't a first resort."</p><p><em> Maybe it should have been</em> . <em> Maybe we'd been a little too casual, a little too defensive, about the whole thing. </em></p><p>"Point," Kiba conceded. "I wouldn't have wanted to be too close to that fuck-ton of explosives."</p><p>"And that was only the opening move," I said dryly.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We reached Mori-gai in the early hours of the morning. Given that the mission scroll specified the girl as the child of the ambassador, I'd been expecting the place to be a city. Some place that would make sense to post an ambassador.</p><p>It wasn't.</p><p>It wasn't <em> small</em> exactly – it was a good sized town, but it jarred with my expectation. The ambassador didn't work there; she lived there when she wasn't in the capitol or away on postings.</p><p>"Thank you for coming," she said, face calm and composed as she greeted us. She appeared unruffled, though there was a tightness to the corners of her eyes. She didn't seem bothered by our youth, though some of the people with her were giving us looks, which suggested she might have worked with ninja before.</p><p>Well. She'd known to call us. And done it quickly, too.</p><p>"Of course," I said, bowing. "Ambassador Kan. Please forgive our abruptness, but time is of the essence. Can you tell us what happened?"</p><p>"My daughter Makoto is missing," the Ambassador said. She picked up a framed photograph and handed it to me, showing a young dark-haired girl of about eight or nine years old. "She often takes food to some of the … disadvantaged children in a poor area of town after school. Today she didn't return home. When we searched the area we found her schoolbag in a field near the forest."</p><p>"Is this her bag?" Kiba asked, moving closer to the item in question, where it was propped up against the wall.</p><p>"Yes," Kan confirmed. "As far as I can tell, nothing is missing."</p><p>Kiba set Akamaru down beside it and probably got a good scent off of it himself. I hoped. There didn't look to be any blood on it, or anything of the sort, but I'd wait until we were out of the house to ask.</p><p>"Which area was this?" I asked, unfolding my map on the table so she could point us in the right direction.</p><p>The sooner we got started, the better.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Lost Child Arc: Chapter 119</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 119</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Action is the foundational key to all success. ~ Pablo Picasso</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Okay, this was where her bag was sitting," Kiba said, pointing at a particular spot on the ground.</p><p>I eyeballed it. Imagined the scenario. A young girl – girls? – coming into the clearing, slinging their bags off and onto the ground. There was a tree there to prop it up against, out of the way to the side. Yeah. Made sense.</p><p>It was dark now, but we both had LED seals to brighten up the places we were looking. It didn't make much difference to Kiba but I didn't want to miss any visual clues, either.</p><p>"There've been a lot of people through here," Kiba went on. "All the searchers, I guess. The scent trails are a mess."</p><p>Akamaru prowled around on the ground, nose low in the grass. Kiba seemed to be shifting back and forth, looking for scent pockets or something.</p><p>I made a non-committal noise. You couldn't exactly expect people not to search, even if it messed up all the evidence and our ability to track. There was nothing here that <em> I</em> could use – the physical signs were well and truly masked, and there was no chakra nearby.</p><p>"There were five… no, six kids with her. They all smell similar. I think they must live together? Not family, though. It's a different kind of similar. Picking up scent from the same surroundings. I think they might be street kids."</p><p>"A child gang?" I asked, looking critically back the way we'd come. The town was probably big enough to have problems with homelessness. Kan had called them 'disadvantaged' which might have just been a polite euphemism, or she might not have known the full extent.</p><p>"Probably, yeah," Kiba said. He paced the edges of the clearing. "She wasn't with them when they arrived <em> or</em> when they left." He went around again.</p><p>I waited.</p><p>"She came in this way," he said. "I can scent her bag with her. Had a lot of food in it; it left a pretty strong mark."</p><p>"But which way did she leave?" I asked, because that was the important thing, and that was what he wasn't saying.</p><p>He went around again, then shook his head. "I'll spiral out further, see if I can pick it up."</p><p>Akamaru barked, pawing at a spot on the ground. Close to the tree line, but not that close. A couple of large steps away.</p><p>"Bad news?" I asked, voice calm. There was nothing to worry about yet.</p><p>"Trail goes dead," Kiba said shortly. "Right there."</p><p>I double checked my scent blocking so that I didn't add more problems to the pile and approached. I ran my hands through the grass but there was nothing there – no hastily dropped hair pin, no note, no clue. I hadn't really expected anything, but it was best to be thorough.</p><p>Then I closed my eyes and concentrated.</p><p>Was it wishful thinking or did I really feel it? Had there been chakra used here – carefully but deliberately – hours and hours ago, or was it just a fluctuation in the natural energy?</p><p>"Be careful," I said, though I couldn't say for certain if it had been or not. The possibility of it was enough to raise flags. "Potential shinobi interference."</p><p>No one had said the word 'kidnapping' up until now. No one had even suggested it. But that didn't mean it wasn't a possibility.</p><p>Kiba nodded and thankfully didn't ask if I was sure. "If it was anything like a replacement, then I'll be able to pick it up again," he said confidently. "And most people slip with scent masking sooner or later."</p><p>I nodded and ran through our options. "Point me in the direction of the kids," I said. "They might know something."</p><p>"Akamaru'll lead you to them," he said.</p><p>We split up. Akamaru led me on a fairly winding path, and stopped at a building that could be kindly described as ramshackle. I stepped over the piles of junk barring the way and peered inside. At first glance, there was nothing. Then I managed to pick out a shape here, a corner of a blanket there, and see the children who were reduced to hiding in such a place.</p><p>I bit my lip. Because, yeah, these poor kids. On the other, that was not why I was here at all and Makoto Kan might be in a whole lot more trouble. And really, it was a whole lot easier to find a lost child than to fix the socio-economic problems that left a whole group of children homeless.</p><p>I stepped soundlessly into the room, locating what looked like the oldest child. Presumably the one 'in charge'.</p><p>There was no good way to do this, really. Anyone would be frightened to be woken by a stranger in the middle of the night but I didn't actually want to wake <em> all</em> the kids. That kind of chaos would only slow things down.</p><p>So I shook him awake and clamped a hand over his mouth when he drew in a startled breath to scream.</p><p>As predicted, it hardly helped matters.</p><p>"Don't shout," I said, voice low and calm. "I need to ask you what happened to Makoto Kan."</p><p>I sat back, slowly withdrawing my hand.</p><p>He swallowed. "Who are you?" His voice shook with fear, but his eyes darted around. Panicked, yes, but canny.</p><p>He was maybe ten. Maybe twelve. Not so much younger than us, really.</p><p>"A ninja from Konoha," I said, though I suspected it meant very little to him at all. "I'm looking for Makoto. I know she was with you this afternoon. What happened to her?"</p><p>He shook his head, a rapid twitching thing. "I dunno," he said. "I don't know nuffing about that."</p><p>"She's in trouble, isn't she?" I asked, voice calm and sympathetic. I tried to keep any hint of judgement or responsibility out of it.</p><p>"We didn't do nothing!" He insisted, quickly. "She was just… gone."</p><p>I nodded. "Okay. What happened?"</p><p>He hesitated for a long second and I waited it out. Patience. Patience. "She brought us food," he said, drawing up his knees and wrapping his arms around them. "She does that all the time. She's <em> allowed.</em> "</p><p>He looked defiant, like I was going to protest. "She brought you food," I echoed, prompting the story onwards. "And then?"</p><p>"We were going to go down to the river to swim," he said. "She was with us! But she never made it to the river. We waited and waited for ages but she never showed up. We went looking for her but we couldn't find her and then all the adults came and <em> they</em> couldn't find her either-"</p><p>He cut himself off, looking miserable.</p><p>I sat back. It was nothing more than we'd expected, but it was still confirmation. 'Lost' had been upgraded to 'taken'. A bunch of civilian children weren't the greatest of witnesses – and I knew first hand you could take someone from a group of ninja and <em> still</em> not be seen – but they'd been <em> there</em> .</p><p>"I see," I said and pushed myself to my feet.</p><p>There was a shuffling in the darkness. A small pale face pushed itself out from behind a pile of rusted metal. "Are you talking about Makoto-chan?" she whispered, voice hushed. "She went missing just like nee-chan."</p><p>"Just like nee-chan?" I repeated. What was the saying? 'Twice is enemy action'? Whatever it was, it was suspicious.</p><p>The little girl nodded vigorously. "She went missing too!"</p><p>"No one cares, Emi," the boy said, sinking his chin down onto his knees. "Makoto's got her mum making people look for her. No one is going to look for kids like us."</p><p>And that was… well. True. I couldn't say that.</p><p>"When did your sister go missing?" I asked, crouching down again near Emi. "Recently?"</p><p>"Seventeen days ago," Emi said, with the certainty and tone of someone who had counted all of them.</p><p>Maybe related. Maybe not. If Makoto had been taken because her mother was an Ambassador, then there was no reason to suspect that this had anything to do with it. If Makoto had been taken just because she was <em> here</em> , at the wrong place at the wrong time… That was a different story.</p><p>"I'll keep an eye out for her," I said, but it was mostly an empty promise. I stood and fished my storage scroll out of my backpack, and released a stack of rations. Not all of them – I still had a weeks supply left, which would keep me going even if this mission stretched out. "Here. It's not much…"</p><p>It wasn't much. It was a small thing that cost me little but it was nothing that would change their situation in the long term, either. They needed more help than that, more than just <em> food.</em> But that wasn't my mission, wasn't my problem right now.</p><p>I gave an awkward shrug and walked away, mind already slipping back to focus on the task at hand.</p><p>I slipped through the town, returning to Kiba. "Find anything?" I asked finding him in the forest well away from the field where Makoto had gone missing.</p><p>He flashed a feral looking grin my way. "Yep," he said with satisfaction. "I found her trail."</p><p>I nodded. "Find anyone <em> else's</em> trail?"</p><p>The grin faded a tiny fraction. "Maybe," he said cagily. "I'm not going to say there <em> wasn't</em> anyone else…"</p><p>But he couldn't confirm there was, either. Too old or too faint or just too damn good to leave much of a mark behind. The blank spot in the trail was suspicious in itself, wasn't it? Then again, a scent trail was hardly like a paved walkway – it wasn't permanent or fixed, it could blow away in the wind or vanish.</p><p>Still. We had a trail now.</p><p>I nodded. "Well," I said, "I guess we should follow it and find out."</p><p>The trail wound through the trees with a kind of surety. It looped, but it didn't double back. It kept a north-easterly direction, driving us steadily closer and closer towards the border with Land of Hot Springs. Toward Land of Lightning.</p><p>That might have been coincidence. It might not. I didn't much like it either way.</p><p>We were travelling fast and the trail got warmer and warmer as we closed in. By that point, we were both certain there was at least one ninja involved, if not more.</p><p>"Hold up," Kiba said suddenly.</p><p>I obligingly slammed to a halt. There was no panic in his tone, nothing that indicated <em> ambush</em> or <em> problem.</em> My own chakra sense told me nothing of the sort, either. So I wasn't worried. But this was his show and I was following his lead. If he said 'hold', I held.</p><p>He twisted in place, moved back and forth, nose titled up to catch the breeze. Akamaru nosed at the ground, still following the trail we were chasing.</p><p>"The trail is still solid," Kiba said, finally. "We can keep following it. But I'm getting sent from the breeze – I'm pretty sure they're camped upwind of us."</p><p>"Pretty sure," I repeated, not quite a question. We were potentially hours behind Makoto and her kidnapper, and following directly in their footsteps wouldn't help us. It was the slow and steady path, sure to take us to them – but take us there in time? That was unknown. If they were heading across the border, if they headed into Lightning Country… we might not be able to follow. If we could save time with a shortcut, it would only be to our benefit. But cutting away risked losing the trail.</p><p>"Pretty sure," Kiba affirmed. "Your call, <em> team leader.</em> "</p><p>His tone of voice was, perhaps, not entirely kind. I stifled a grimace. Yeah, my call. I hated making calls like this. Hated it even more when it wasn't our lives in the balance, but a blameless little girl.</p><p>"Do it," I said. "Find us the camp."</p><p>We sprung off, turning into the breeze. Anxiety churned in my guts as I hoped I'd made the right call. There was no way to tell yet.</p><p>The longer we ran for, the tighter the knot twisted. How far could they be? Kiba had seemed so <em> sure.</em></p><p>And then people pinged on the very edge of my range. Oh, there had been people, as we'd run. Even rural areas weren't deserted. We'd passed houses and waypoints. But not like this. This was <em> ninja.</em></p><p>I re-angled us, homing in on them. Kiba had done well to get us this close but now it was my game.</p><p>"Two adult shinobi," I murmured, quietly. I reduced my pace, gave us more time to plan. "Two civilian children."</p><p>"Two?" Kiba asked, darting a look at me. "More than we expected."</p><p>Since we'd only expected <em> one.</em> Meant this was bigger than we'd thought. In what way, I didn't know just yet.</p><p>I nodded in acknowledgement. "How's your stealth?"</p><p>He looked away. "Okay."</p><p><em> Fair enough</em> . "I'll get closer, see if I can work out what they're up to," I said. "Keep sharp, okay? They took her a long way just to make camp. <em> And</em> they weren't dragging the other kids with them this whole time. There's probably more ninja around."</p><p>"If they're here I'll find 'em," he promised.</p><p>I nodded sharply. Then I checked my scent suppression, pulled my chakra in good and tight, and slunk carefully towards the enemy camp.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Once I was into position and overlooking the shinobi camp, there were two problems.</p><p>Firstly, the shinobi in question were wearing blank featureless masks. ANBU. Not Konoha, obviously, but the point of ANBU was that they weren't all that easy to identify. If I had to pick, I would have said they were from Hidden Cloud, from the asymmetrical line of their vests, but they could have just as easily been Hidden Rock. Or not from one of the big five at all.</p><p>Secondly and most importantly… neither of the two children was Makoto.</p><p><em> Shit.</em> <em> We screwed up.</em></p><p>The two kids were huddled together, unhurt but tired and scared. They weren't tied up, but that almost didn't matter – there was no way they could hope to escape anyway.</p><p>Who they were and why they were here… I didn't have a clue. The obvious assumption was that they were still kidnapping victims, in which case we should probably help them. It was the only explanation, though, as to why they might be here with an ANBU guard. Sadly, said ANBU weren't expositing at each other to allow me to overhear and find out. Because they were professionals.</p><p>I stayed crouched in the treetops a little longer, aware that the clock had started ticking down again. I was chewing frantically through my options. Makoto was our priority and we'd screwed up and lost her. We'd have to backtrack, try and find the trail again, try and catch up an even greater distance.</p><p>I began to back away and then froze again. There was an incoming ninja approaching the camp. The two ANBU exchanged handsigns – unfamiliar to me – but seemed to be expecting it. For good reason; the new comer was wearing the same uniform.</p><p>They were carrying another child over their shoulder. And this time, I did recognize the small dark-haired girl.</p><p><em> Makoto.</em></p><p>She looked slightly different from the picture we'd been shown, and her face was blotchy from crying, but she didn't appear to be hurt.</p><p>The surge of relief I felt was unsurprising. We were in the right place after all. What was going on, I still didn't know, but we hadn't lost her.</p><p>Now we just had to get her back. And <em> that</em> didn't make me feel a great deal of relief. There were three ANBU down there, skills and motives unknown. We had to protect and rescue three very helpless hostages.</p><p>'Nightmare' didn't quite cover it.</p><p>I waited until the ANBU seemed marginally occupied and retreated backwards with as much stealth as I could muster and carefully avoided all the layered traps around the camp. Kiba was well away from the camp, downwind and out of sensor range.</p><p>"You want to play the good news, bad news game?" I asked.</p><p>"That's real inspiring," he said dryly. "Okay. Good news?"</p><p>"Makoto is there," I said promptly. "Now ask me for the bad news."</p><p>"I dunno," he said. "I feel like that's enough to be getting on with. Are we going to get her back or what?"</p><p>Akamaru barked.</p><p>"Bad news," I went on. "Is that there's also three ANBU and two other hostages."</p><p>"Yeah," Kiba said, and tapped his nose. "I knew there was more than one…" he trailed off and shifted awkwardly. "So. Real question. Can you take them?"</p><p>I experienced a jolt of <em> actual terror</em> at the question. Oh no. Kiba actually thought I could do it. He was seriously considering that in a matchup of 'Shikako vs three ANBU' I would come out ahead. Not just ahead but comfortably enough that it wasn't our <em> last choice.</em></p><p>I blew out a breath. "Collateral damage, remember?" I said, even though that wasn't quite an answer.</p><p>I wasn't exactly filled with joy at the prospect. Any fight was a risk, and multiple opponents with unknown skills was riskier than most.</p><p>I had fought groups of people on my own before, but it had not been nearly so intentional. Well, mostly. Then again, it wasn't like we had a lot of choice right now either. It wasn't like we had any backup coming.</p><p>We could try just taking the kids and running – thus avoiding the 'fight' portion of the evening – but that hadn't worked out too well for us last time and they knew where we lived. Or the kids lived. Whatever.</p><p>Getting the ANBU out of the way seemed… necessary.</p><p>"It'll be sunrise soon," I said slowly, squinting at the trees. "That'll help. I could probably tag them with Shadow Possession…" Kiba would have to stay back because his stealth wasn't good enough to get close without being noticed. Then he'd have to deal with getting through all the traps in a hurry, which would be dangerous and give away his position.</p><p>I squinted thoughtfully at him. "How's your aim in Fang Over Fang? For throwing stuff, I mean, not for yourself."</p><p>He blinked, blank faced. "I … don't normally throw things," he settled on.</p><p>"Scrap that idea then," I murmured, though it was about what I expected. I had a barrier seal with me, so we <em> could</em> set up protection around the kids. It'd have to be implemented though and fast. I hadn't wanted to split my attention between trapping the ANBU and setting it up, but it looked like I would probably have to. "It was a long shot, anyway."</p><p>And then, suddenly, everything was go.</p><p>I slipped back towards the camp, undoing as many traps as I could to give him a clear run for it (and setting a few of my own, just in case). It wasn't actually much – evading traps was one thing, undoing them was quite another and not something I'd focused on learning.</p><p>Kiba followed a little closer, but stayed far enough to be undetected by the ANBU. Hopefully. We were relying on having the element of surprise and taking them all out at once and that would be ruined if we didn't, actually, have the element of surprise.</p><p>Unfortunately, when I got to the camp, they seemed to be packing up.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>It would be much harder to ambush them on the move.</p><p>Safer, maybe, because they wouldn't be so defended and they would be hampered by carrying the children, but it would be harder for us to choose a choke point when we didn't know where they were going and more dangerous for the children.</p><p><em> Before they leave, then.</em></p><p>I waited, watching the sun creep slowly over the horizon. A little bit of sun was all I needed.</p><p>There was no perfect moment and I was aware of the clock ticking down. The three ANBU were spread out around the camp, not nicely grouped together as a target. The three kids were huddled together, which was the only bright spot.</p><p><em> It'll have to do.</em></p><p>My shadow crept quietly down the tree trunks and across the ground, a dark snake barely noticeable in the dawn light. Grass didn't rustle in its passing, there was no sign or signal and none of the ANBU were looking down.</p><p>Somehow, I still only managed to catch two of them.</p><p>The third vanished from my hold the instant the jutsu took shape, intangible like smoke and then gone. It felt like closing my fist over empty air, expecting to grab something and finding nothing.</p><p><em> Shit.</em></p><p>I set off the signal – an exploding note in one of the more dangerous perimeter traps – and threw my four scrolls around the kids.</p><p>"Sealing Style; Four Corner Barrier Seal!"</p><p>Kiba and Akamaru crashed out of the forest in a twin Tunneling Fang, two spirals of destruction crashing into the clearing and wiping out my captives. I let them go at the last second, as the impact of the attack started to shudder through the connection.</p><p>Only one of them went down. Akamaru rebounded off the other, ricocheting at an ugly angle and into the ground with a startled yelp.</p><p><em> Double shit.</em></p><p>Some kind of defensive technique? A barrier? There was a sheen of chakra, but I didn't have time to contemplate it – I needed to catch the third ANBU, the one who had escaped my Shadow Possession. His chakra was jumping around, here then here then there, impossibly fast. <em> Teleportation? Body Flicker?</em></p><p>The jumps were fast but small.</p><p>And moving away from the camp, like he was fleeing.</p><p>Or like a trap.</p><p>I twisted, pivoting on the spot and bringing my kunai up to block the sword aimed at my neck. For a split second, I stared into that blank featureless mask and was <em> afraid.</em> It was creepy – no wonder these things were given to black ops. The eye holes were just black voids, no eyes, nothing to say there was a person behind it at all.</p><p>Then I kicked out and booted him in the stomach, foot charged to deliver a Touch Blast and make sure it took. Only it didn't, but only because my entire foot went through him.</p><p><em> Illusion or incorporeality?</em></p><p>No. Too fast – he was gone again. It was no genjutsu, that much I could tell. The sword I was blocking had been real enough. It had had weight and power. He'd flickered away, that was it. I was kicking an afterimage, too late to be of use. His chakra signal and position bounced around, rapid fire bursts. But I was starting to see a pattern now – it <em> was</em> like body flicker. Short, fast, straight-line bursts.</p><p>But he hadn't stuck around to fight at speed, if he could keep that up in a taijutsu match then there would have been a follow up slash that I'd have had more trouble avoiding.</p><p>So fast, unpredictable jabs. And he'd gone after me – not the kids in their barrier, not Kiba and Akamaru who were fighting their own opponent. Me.</p><p>A plan slid into place. I charged chakra into the stone on my chest, pulled it out and held it. I felt cold, instantly and suddenly, the world layered in shades of grey and shadow. But I held onto an impression of myself, not quite a transformation but close, the kind that let water clones look real until they were disrupted, so that I didn't look any different from the outside.</p><p>Then I shouted 'Kiba' and jumped down to join in his fight.</p><p>It was folly to ignore an opponent. Complete foolishness to turn your back on one.</p><p>So I really did deserve the sword that slid neatly through my back.</p><p>Too neatly to be passing through flesh and blood.I was made entirely of shadow. I clamped down, pinning the sword in place and sprang shadow stitching tendrils out from around it – sharp spikes that lengthened and aimed for weak points – throat, eyes, wrists, elbows.</p><p>He dropped.</p><p>I reversed their momentum, flipping them through my torso and out the front, to tangle the second ANBU. The ones that tried to stab were deflected but those that wound around and restrained were not. Definitely a jutsu. Redirecting kinetic force?</p><p>He backpedaled, away from me, but Kiba was there and spat one of his tangled hairball things straight into his face.</p><p>The hairball thing - <em> Keukegen,</em> I remembered – squelched onto the mask, stretching and sucking around the edges like it was trying to smother him. Good plan. My tendrils crept up, around his neck and tightened. And then they pulled sharply to the side.</p><p>There was a crack. He stopped fighting.</p><p>"That was probably-" Kiba said and the stopped. He stared at me in horror. At my front. Oh, right.</p><p>"Uh," I said, and pulled the sword out through my chest, handle and all. It felt… strange. I let the technique go, changing back from shadow to mortal flesh and blood. "How are the kids?"</p><p>I sealed the bodies into a scroll – both to make sure they were actually dead and to remove the dead bodies from terrified civilian children – and cancelled the protective barrier seal.</p><p>Kiba's horror transmuted into something a bit like sheepishness as he inhaled deeply. "You want the good news or the bad news?" he asked.</p><p><em> Oh, great.</em></p><p>"What is it?" I asked, quietly. Now we had to actually interact with the kids and it seemed a good idea to try to seem not-menacing. Given I had just killed people, it might not have worked.</p><p>"That's not Makoto Kan," Kiba said.</p><p>The words took a second to penetrate. "What do you mean 'that's not Makoto Kan'?" I asked, dully. I felt like I should have expressed surprise because… it sure <em> looked</em> like the girl we were supposed to be finding.</p><p>And more importantly, if this wasn't her…then where was she?</p><p>"I haven't exactly got around to asking yet," Kiba said wryly. "I'm just telling you that this isn't the same girl."</p><p>I sighed and crouched down, ruffling Akamaru's ears with one hand. "Hey kids," I said, voice soft. "My name is Shikako Nara. I'm a ninja from Konoha. We're here to help you, but we need you to tell us what happened, okay?"</p><p>Not-Makoto burst into tears and buried her face into her hands. The older of the other two children raised her chin bravely, though. "They kidnapped us!"</p><p>I nodded, encouragingly.</p><p>"They wanted my dad to give them food," the boy said. "That's why they took me away."</p><p>"Your dad is a merchant?" I asked. It was a start to unravelling this puzzle. Because this was much more than just <em> one</em> child being taken. Obviously.</p><p>"A rice farmer," he corrected. "We have the biggest rice farm in Fire Country!"</p><p>His name was Nori and the girl was Reiko. Not-Makoto turned out to be named Shinju. Reiko was also the daughter of a rice farmer, and Shinju's parents owned an orchard. Apart from the similarities, it really didn't add up to a lot for me.</p><p>"Okay," I said slowly. "Did you see another girl? One who looked like Shinju?"</p><p>Shinju sniffed. "When they took me away," she said and her voice broke. I patted her shoulder awkwardly. "She was there."</p><p>"So no one knows they're missing," Kiba rumbled.</p><p>It fit – in a really convoluted sort of way. Or, no. If I twisted my head to look at it from the other direction, as if I was planning the mission and not trying to sort it out from this angle, it made sense.</p><p>You needed resources from people (presumably) that they weren't willing to give you. Holding hostages probably wasn't the first answer but it was a pretty time honoured sort of solution. But then you needed to make sure no one noticed that you had taken hostages and hired ninja on your ass (i.e. <em> us</em> ) so you went and stuck a similar looking kid in their place. They'd probably been threatened not to hire ninja, but it only took a family friend noticing that your child was <em> gone</em> to work out that something was happening.</p><p>Which meant Makoto had just been in the wrong place at the wrong time – they hadn't been aiming for the daughter of an ambassador, they'd been aiming for a street kid.</p><p><em> No, that's still convoluted as fucking hell</em> .</p><p>"Okay, well," I said, with very little idea of where we were going to go from there. "Let's get you home, then."</p><p><hr /></p><p>It wasn't actually difficult to do all the child swapping.</p><p>Or. Well. It was but we managed. We had no idea if the farms were actually being watched or not and even if I could have snuck past observers there was no way to take the kids with us. Walking in as ninja wasn't a great plan, so it took some creative transformation jutsu and sweet talking to get us where we needed to be.</p><p>But Shinju's parents were really, <em> really</em> happy to see her again and did spill out the rest of the story. Or as much as they knew.</p><p>They had current contracts to supply various places in Land of Fire, which included Konoha, and had been approached by people wishing to transfer those contracts, in part or in full. They'd declined, and then found their daughter missing, a shell shocked replacement and threats.</p><p>We swapped out Makoto and took her home. I summoned Heijomaru to help carry the kids because three of them between the two of us wasn't going to be easy. He took the summons with good grace and not for the first time I thought that I had really, really lucked out with my contract.</p><p>The other two didn't live so close, so I made the executive decision to take them back to Konoha and then organize their return from there. It made more sense, especially if we had to also return their 'replacements' home as well, which was another step.</p><p>"Okay," Izumo said, when we showed up at the gates. "So we can sign them in with a temporary pass, but they'll need supervision. And you'll need to work something out after that expires."</p><p>"Yeah, thanks," I agreed, scribbling on the paper where he pointed. "It shouldn't take long."</p><p>"What's the plan?" Kiba asked, holding one kid with each hand so they didn't wander off.</p><p>"I want to grab some paperwork quickly," I said. "Get their parents names. Find out how much they supply us with. That sort of thing."</p><p>"There are people in the tower who do that," he said, not protesting as much as confused. "You know, <em> as their jobs.</em> We can just hand it over."</p><p>"Yeah," I said patiently. "And those people are me. Look. I just… want to make sure. Can you watch them for a bit? Maybe get some food?"</p><p>We had fed them on the way, but it had clearly been a long day for them. It had been a long day for us, too, and I could understand why Kiba wanted to be finished with it.</p><p>"Alright, alright," he said. "Don't take too long, okay?"</p><p>I didn't plan on it. I just wanted to make sure all the i's were dotted and all the t's were crossed. And I was pretty sure that since ANBU were involved, we were never going to hear about this again once it was out of our hands.</p><p>Luckily I had so much experience in navigating the tower paperwork system, because I managed to track down invoices from the relevant farms. Or at least, track down someone who could track them down.</p><p>We found Nori's easily enough but not Reiko's.</p><p>"Hmm, it's not here… oh, right. It'll be with the negotiators. They defaulted or withdrew or something like that," he said, shrugging.</p><p>"That happen a lot?" I asked, casually.</p><p>"Sometimes. Places go under. There's a bad harvest – I think it must be a bad year this year. We've had a few. Which sucks, because we're supposed to be increasing our orders so we can start stockpiling. We've had to go looking for new suppliers, which is not an easy task, let me tell you!"</p><p><em> A few?</em> It niggled.</p><p>"Do you have a list?" I asked. "Of recent changes?"</p><p>"No," he shook his head. "Or, well, I guess we could compare total purchases and work out which ones have decreased… What did you say this was for, again?"</p><p>"Intel summary," I said, smiling easily. "Like you said, we're supposed to be starting to stockpile."</p><p>I swung by missions desk, booked a briefing room and asked them to dispatch a runner to collect Kiba and the 'clients'. Then I hit up Intel to find Aoba.</p><p>"I'd like a second opinion, Aoba-sempai," I said carefully. "So that I'm not blowing this out of proportion."</p><p>I didn't think I was, but I had no evidence to it being <em> more</em> than what we'd seen. And I didn't want it to be dismissed out of hand just because I was occasionally slightly paranoid.</p><p>"Sure," he said, shifting his glasses. "What's up?"</p><p>I waited until we were in the briefing room before I started. The comparison of purchases that I'd managed to get quickly was just a bunch of photocopied pages with highlights, so it was messy and a little hard to follow.</p><p>"Okay, so," I started, pressing my hands flat on the table. "During my last mission we ran into a non-Konoha ANBU team that had kidnapped three children. They were the children of nearby farms – ones that supply Konoha. We were able to determine that they were being held hostage in order to force the farms to stop selling to us."</p><p>Aoba opened his mouth then closed it again. Then said, "you found an <em> ANBU team</em> ? No wait. Never mind. What's the problem?"</p><p>I pushed forward the papers. "These three are the farms," I said. "Only one of them had time to contact Konoha about the situation" -which meant Reiko had been kidnapped for close to a week at the least- "but when I compared previous volumes of purchases to what we're currently getting, there are at least fifteen other <em> dramatic</em> decreases. It strikes me as slightly suspicious in light of the fact that there is known enemy action in this area."</p><p>Aoba nodded, looking over the papers. "Not all of these will be related," he cautioned. "But it's a good call to reassess them. I'll assign someone to go over the records and look for discrepancies. And send people out to investigate."</p><p>I nodded back. "They were replacing the kidnapped children with lookalikes so that it wasn't noticeable that they were missing," I said. "I'm not sure if there were people in place to watch them, but the parents were warned against contacting shinobi."</p><p>"Do you know where they were taking the hostages?" Aoba asked, leaning forward. "That's probably more important at this stage."</p><p>I shook my head and shrugged. "I don't even know where they're <em> from</em> ," I said. "But I did retrieve the bodies so, uh, I guess you can identify them?" Then I frowned. "I mean, I'd guess they were taking them out of the country. If they were planning on keeping them long term, it would be safer. Other than that…"</p><p>I shrugged again.</p><p>Aoba sighed and sat back in his chair. "Well, I guess we better kick it up the chain. Let's go see the Hokage."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Lost Child Arc: Chapter 120</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: I was away for a few weeks on holiday; it was lovely! – thanks to all those who asked!</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 120</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Nothing is work unless you'd rather be doing something else. ~ George Halas</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"What was your original mission again?" Tsunade asked, squinting at me. At least she'd waited until the whole sordid tale had been told – twice even, because she'd stopped me part way into it in order to drag Kakashi-sensei into the meeting – before making sarcastic remarks.</p><p>"Search and rescue for a missing child," I said, then added pointedly, "who had in fact been kidnapped by these ninja."</p><p>She huffed, with a kind of disbelieving air, but it wasn't like I'd gone out of my way for this.</p><p>The levity was brief, anyway.</p><p>"I'm putting this under War Operations," she said, flicking a hand towards Kakashi. "No matter who's responsible, there's no denying that it's a deliberate attempt to weaken Konoha. We'll get an autopsy done of the bodies and see if we can narrow it down, but I want you to come up with a list of candidates."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei shrugged, wryly. "Everyone?" he suggested.</p><p>She treated that with the attention it deserved and ignored it completely. "Find out how they got away with it, what we can do to stop it happening again and, if necessary, whether it's a tactic we should be considering."</p><p>No easy task. Sneaking an ANBU team through the border was doable. Probably. I wasn't an expert, but 'stealth' was kinda their jam. <em> Stopping</em> an ANBU team getting through the border was a much taller order. And protecting a massive number of civilian targets? Even taller.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei went still. He still looked laconic – hands in his pockets, slouched casually – but there was a tension to it now. "Easier just to burn it," he said. "If it comes down to that."</p><p>"And then everyone starves," Tsunade finished, like they weren't just discussing torching food supplies. Or maybe exactly like they were discussing it.</p><p>I glanced at Kiba, who looked just as out of his depth as I felt.</p><p>"Aoba can coordinate the record search," Tsunade picked up briskly. "Start with food, but widen it to general supplies after that. They'll probably also try to target our weapons trade, if they haven't already."</p><p>"Yes, Hokage-sama," Aoba said, not looking entirely thrilled at the task, but with the resignation of someone who knew it needed to get done.</p><p>The Hokage tapped her fingers on her desk, staring into the distance like she was contemplating options. "If we're lucky, the team you encountered wouldn't be expected to be returning with the hostages just yet. If we're not, they may already know that the operation has been blown. In that case, any further hostages may be in danger. Kiba, could you pick up the scent trail again?"</p><p>"Yes," Kiba said, immediate and sure. He grinned. "You want me to track them back?"</p><p>"No," she said. "I want an <em> elite covert tracking squad</em> to track them back. In the interests of saving time, I want you to show them where to start. You will go, you will show them where, then you will return. Understood?"</p><p>His grin faded a bit. "Understood, Hokage-sama."</p><p>"Good. Shikako, I want you to work with Shizune on finishing that seal. As soon as possible."</p><p>It took me a second to wrap my brain around the order – not because I didn't know what she meant, but I didn't understand why. But obviously, Kisuke would be the best choice for covertly searching enemy territory. They'd never see him, never know he was there.</p><p>"Um," I said, not because I wanted to protest but because there was a reason that our progress on the seal had stalled. We were stuck. "I'm going to need those notes."</p><p>I was treated to a laser-eyed stare. It was intensely uncomfortable.</p><p>"Very well," she said. "I'll authorize Shizune to access them."</p><p>If they were going to send him <em> now</em> , then there wasn't any time for me to make adjustments. But maybe Tsunade was just anticipating that she would need him again, very shortly in the future.</p><p>Still. It was a little disappointing to not be included with the actual retrieval part of the mission. I could understand why, objectively, you wouldn't want to send a Special Jounin and a Chunin to do an ANBU's job but… we'd been the ones who found it and worked it out.</p><p>"You can always help with the paperwork," Aoba commented, under his breath.</p><p>"This seal is very important," I said solemnly. I wasn't <em> that</em> disappointed.</p><p>And yeah, I was pretty eager to get my hands on those notes. I'd hand over a hundred interesting missions to ANBU if it meant I got to study them. Even limited access to anything about Edo Tensei was priceless. No one else knew just how much.</p><p>I was scheduled in to look at them the next day, and since it was late and no one else had anything for me to do… I went home.</p><p>I scavenged some food for dinner out of the fridge and settled into the lounge where dad and Shikamaru were playing shogi. Shikamaru was wearing the Shadow Hand, using it to carefully but dexterously pick up the small wood shogi pieces and move them. I tried not to feel too pleased about it.</p><p>"Did your mission go well?" Shikamaru asked, with a kind of forced neutrality and levity.</p><p>"Exceptionally," I answered. Then waved my chopsticks in dads direction. "Sorry about that."</p><p>"I haven't been called in, so I assume it's not an emergency," he said, with a touch of resignation.</p><p>"Nah," I said, shrugging a shoulder. "I'm sure you'll hear all about it tomorrow, anyway."</p><p>"Something to look forward to," he said dryly.</p><p>"What happened?" Shikamaru interrupted. "What went wrong?"</p><p>"Nothing went <em> wrong,</em> " I said, though that was a matter of interpretation. "It was a search and rescue. We searched. We rescued. There was just… some additional stuff."</p><p>Actually, that was pretty much the theme of my Sensor Squad missions. Complete but extra.</p><p>I wasn't exactly sure I could talk about it anyway. Certainly the 'extra' was classified, just because it wasn't finished. Also ANBU were involved. That tended to mean classified.</p><p>Shikamaru gave me a searching look, full of hesitancy. "You seem happy about it."</p><p>"Well, yeah," I said, a little surprised. "We saved a couple of kids. Nobody got hurt. It was a good mission."</p><p>A long one, maybe, but one long day wasn't the same as weeks of them in a row. And it was a different kind of tired, when you knew you were accomplishing something.</p><p>"How were things here?" I asked, instead of following that thought.</p><p>"It's fine but Kofuku-oba wants you back in R&amp;D," Shikamaru said. As if I had been gone longer than <em> a day.</em></p><p>"Mmm," I said, vaguely. "Can't. Have to do some sealwork for Tsunade."</p><p>There was silence and the click-clack of shogi pieces on the board.</p><p>"Have you thought about trying to teach some of the researchers about fuuinjutsu?" Dad asked, casually but carefully.</p><p>I blinked at him. "Uh. I don't actually know that much about it," I said. "I mostly just make it up as I go along."</p><p>But I could see why he was suggesting it – if they were going to have a hand in regulating seals and such, then it would be better if they actually knew what they were working with. And also… there'd be much less pressure on me to go and do it for them.</p><p>I chewed on my lip, thoughtfully. "I did mean to submit some stuff to the clan archives. I could clean it up a little and give it to you." It was nowhere near <em> good</em> but I could strip out the worst of the egregious errors.</p><p>"That would be a good start," Dad acknowledged. "But its difficult subject matter to learn without a teacher, isn't it?"</p><p>It wasn't like I'd never complained about that. And I'd only started getting really good at seals after Jiraiya had given me pointers. And I'd stumbled across access to information most people didn't have access to, as well.</p><p>"It's not that easy," I deflected, though it was a weak defense. "I could talk about it for a whole week and only cover exploding notes."</p><p>His lips quirked into a smirk. "Then start there."</p><p>It wasn't that I didn't want to… but yeah, I didn't want to. Teaching – actual, dedicated teaching and not just throwing off-hand advice when I felt like it or poking people in particular directions and watching them go – was a serious investment of time, effort and frustration.</p><p>I made a face.</p><p>"Who you teach is up to you," Dad added, like that was sweetening the pot. It was, a bit, but if anyone really wanted to learn then I was probably too much of a pushover to turn them away. "I can put together a list of those interested."</p><p>I put my bowl down and collapsed backwards onto the floor so I could stare up at the ceiling. "Ugh," I said, trying to sum up my feelings on the matter concisely.</p><p>I was probably going to end up doing it, I admitted. Because <em> the clan</em> and <em> duty</em> and it really was a great skill that a lot of people would like to learn.</p><p>Dad padded away to the downstairs office and came back with a scroll that he dropped unceremoniously on my chest.</p><p>I unrolled it and squinted at it. "This is just the clan register," I complained. "D<em> a</em> d. Did you go and get this just so you could make a joke?"</p><p>He looked highly amused, so 'yes'. He was the worst. "It's not a joke," he said, instead. "Anyone on the list. The choice is yours."</p><p>"Ugh," I said, resigned to the fact that my brain was already ticking over ways to make it work. I didn't miss the fact that he'd moved from 'please do it' to 'how you do it is up to you'. We'd apparently already boarded this rollercoaster ride. "Let me think about it."</p><p><hr /></p><p>There was a line in a Discworld book I'd read once, about people believing in lies and concepts that existed without physical basis – the idea that if you ground down the universe to its tiniest parts, you wouldn't find a single ounce of justice, not a molecule of mercy, no hard evidence that either existed.</p><p>Souls were supposed to be like that too.</p><p>A thing of <em> faith</em> or belief. You could know and trust in them but you couldn't <em> prove </em> them. Couldn't quantify them, couldn't measure them, couldn't really know.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Yet. Here in these notes, in Orochimaru's surprisingly messy handwriting, was proof.</p><p>(I didn't know why I'd thought he should have tidy handwriting. I hadn't thought about it consciously. It was just… surprising, that it was messy. That was all. )</p><p>A mathematical formula for a soul; for containing a soul. I'd known it had to exist, in some way, shape or form, given the whole <em> Edo Tensei</em> thing. And yet.</p><p>"Well," I said, blandly, tapping my pen against the page. "There it is."</p><p>I slid it towards Shizune, who flicked her eyes over it and hummed with only vague interest. 'Oh, yes. What a normal thing to find. Carry on, then.' Like this was something <em> perfectly normal</em> -</p><p>-well. Again. It was what we'd been looking for. Maybe I was the one overreacting for being weirded out. This was a world where we could turn the power of our thoughts into actionable energy. We were looking into this seal on behalf of a <em> ghost</em> .</p><p>Maybe there was no great philosophical debate to be had here. Maybe souls were just a form of energy that everyone had. Something to be studied and contained and manipulated.</p><p>I shouldn't be freaking out.</p><p>As Nara, I already knew how to manipulate my own spiritual energy-</p><p>(But that was <em> different.</em> That was a way to change yourself from the inside. Like studying. Like New Years resolutions. You thought, so you did, so you were.)</p><p>"Is that the same as the Soul-Body Separation Seal?" Shizune asked, interrupting my looping train of thought. "Will it help?"</p><p>"Mostly, yeah," I said, tapping my pen against the table, unfocused. "And the parts that aren't will benefit if we can make them closer to it. But the really important part is that it has a termination condition – a couple of them, actually. We'd still have to manage to give ownership of the jutsu back to Kisuke, which might be tricky, but it's a whole lot more possible."</p><p>There were still distance issue – Edo Tensei itself got around them by affixing the seal to the bodies but the issue here was that there was no body to affix to.</p><p>Shizune nodded and went back to her own paperwork. This time around, she'd brought a whole stack of things with her and only really collaborated when I needed to ask specific questions. And there weren't many of those that she could really answer, anymore. She was supervising, and supervising Orochimaru's notes more than she was supervising me at that.</p><p>I copied down the seals diligently onto note paper, making plenty of annotations and digressions to cover the fact that I was copying it out <em> twice.</em> One set would be the official notes for the seal – the other I'd hopefully whisk off into hammerspace when Shizune's attention was diverted.</p><p>It was probably against the <em> spirit</em> of my orders, if not necessarily the letter.</p><p>Scratch that – it definitely was. But it wasn't really an opportunity that I could let go past.</p><p>Although I could hope that we'd never get as far as having to fight an Edo Tensei army, I'd feel a whole lot better if I could work on a counter for it.</p><p>When you put it in those terms, making slightly illegal copies of horribly immoral research notes was a no-brainer.</p><p>Didn't mean I would be in any less trouble if I got caught, though.</p><p>Those two things alone – Shadow Hand and Edo Tensei - kept me busy. No matter how much work I put into them, it seemed like people wanted more. I could have worked on them for years and no one would have been happy.</p><p>Thankfully, once the main chunk of work was done, Kakashi-sensei was my savior.</p><p>"Jiraiya suggested you spend some time at the Fire Temple," he said, casually, tossing me a mission scroll.</p><p>I peeked at it, seeing a simple delivery mission to the place in question. "He did," I admitted. "Thank you." Somehow, it had always ended up further and further down my list of things to do, no matter how big a deal Sage mode was, or how useful barrier sealing could be.</p><p>Sensei shrugged, like it wasn't a big deal. "Special Jounin are expected to take training trips," he said. "Chunin too, but they can still find teachers in Konoha."</p><p>Once you were a Special Jounin, it went unsaid, you were probably the leader in your field of specialization. Meaning, you'd probably exhausted what Konoha could provide, if it was something obscure. Even if it wasn't, a solid chunk of training time would probably not go amiss.</p><p>"Asuma usually requests the missions to the Fire Temple," Sensei went on, a crinkle of amusement around his eye. "I think one of his buddies from the Guardian Ninja lives there. He's pretty annoyed at me."</p><p>He said it like that was a bonus. To him it probably was.</p><p>"I'm glad you're willing to risk the wrath of Asuma-sensei for my sake," I said, overly solemn. "I hope he doesn't manage to convince Kurenai-sensei to help him get revenge."</p><p>That didn't make him look any more worried about it all, but that was Kakashi-sensei for you.</p><p>It wasn't an urgent mission, so I didn't need to leave immediately, but sooner was better than later. Still, there was plenty to do in preparation. I needed to get permission for said training trip and – if I was very lucky – put the rest of Kakashi-sensei's implied information to use.</p><p>I.e. That Asuma-sensei was both in the village and had contacts in the Fire Temple that he was on good terms with.</p><p>Which would make the whole thing a whole lot easier, if I could get someone to vouch for me with the monks. They were probably less suspicious than ninja, on the whole, but that didn't mean they wouldn't be suspicious at all<em> .</em></p><p>And also to break the news to my family that I was going to be gone for at least a month. Yeah. I could see that going over <em> not well.</em> But… it had been more than a month – nearly two, in fact! – since we'd got back from the Land of Moon. There had to be a point where it was okay for me to start getting back into the swing of ninja life. And it was a training trip. It wasn't like it was going to be dangerous.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Fire Temple Arc: Chapter 121</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 121</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. ~ Anonymous</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"So, a training trip, huh?" Shikamaru asked, leaning against my doorframe.</p><p>I paused in folding clothes and looked up at him. He looked casual, arms crossed against his chest. But he was wearing the Shadow Hand in order to have his arms crossed – did that make it more or less casual?</p><p>I missed not having to guess. Missed <em> knowing</em> and missed conversations that hadn't had layers to guess at.</p><p>"Yeah," I said. "They're experts in barrier techniques, so it'll be useful if I manage to learn anything. Asuma-sensei agreed to introduce me to some of his friends at the temple, actually, so I'm hopeful it'll go well." I shrugged. "The timing isn't really the greatest but it's an opportunity that I have to take."</p><p>"You'll be by yourself the whole time, though," Shikamaru pointed out.</p><p>"There'll be people there; I'm not running away into the wilderness." Though not people I knew, which was probably his point. Asuma-sensei wasn't staying, so I would be on my own. Still, it wasn't like I'd never done <em> that</em> before, either. "It's only a month, anyway. I'll manage."</p><p>Even if I didn't manage to adapt and make friends, a month was a short enough period of time that you could just… wait for it to be over.</p><p>"I kinda wish you could come," I said, ruefully. "But you probably wouldn't get very much out of it."</p><p>It was true, in way. I wanted those years back, too. That relationship. Realistically, taking Shikamaru with me would probably just irritate the hell out of me – put a limit on my ability to learn and the amount of time I could spend training. I would hate it.</p><p>But maybe it wasn't really about realism. I wished an imaginary Shikako could take an imaginary Shikamaru with her to an imaginary Fire Temple for an imaginary holiday. It was a wistful, unreal thing – that was why it was a 'wish' and not a 'want'.</p><p>Shikamaru snorted, but pushed off the doorframe and stepped inside my room for the first time in the conversation. "Yeah, they're not exactly known for their ninjutsu," he said, flopping down on the bed.</p><p>"Nope," I agreed, trying not to feel surprised. "Taijutsu, maybe. But that's about it."</p><p>Shikamaru made a face. "I'll pass. I get enough of that here."</p><p>I waited a moment, but went back to packing. "You'll probably be busy enough with R&amp;D, anyway," I said, because that was another thing on my mental checklist of loose ends to tie up before I went.</p><p>"Yeah, we can't both ditch them," he said, with a snort. "Can you imagine how annoyed Kofuku-oba would be?"</p><p>"She wouldn't know how to treat us if she wasn't annoyed at us," I said dryly.</p><p>"With you, you mean," Shikamaru shot back. "She still likes me."</p><p>"I don't need her to like me, I just need her to do what I want," I said. Which was a good thing, because I was hardly rolling in good will around here these days.</p><p>"You need everyone to like you," Shikamaru said, and there was nothing I could say to that except 'not anymore' and that felt too heavy for what this conversation was.</p><p>"Speaking of," I deflected. "Do you think I should take a host gift to the temple? Something? I feel like I should, but then, monks. Maybe not."</p><p>"I think you're supposed to make donations," he said, but doubtfully, like he wasn't sure either.</p><p>At least that conversation meant that we parted on good terms. When Asuma-sensei and I departed Konoha the next day, Shikamaru wandered down to the gates to wave us off.</p><p>The trip to the temple was slow. Asuma-sensei wasn't in any kind of hurry, content to amble along. I was a bit more eager to actually arrive, and would have probably run the distance if I'd been on my own, but since he was doing me a favour I couldn't justify pushing us to go faster.</p><p>I half wondered if he was playing a 'learn some patience, student' card, which was a thing Kakashi-sensei probably would have done, except I had plenty of tolerance for inactivity on a mission. You didn't get to choose when things happened on missions, you just had to react to them. And sometimes those things were 'nothing' and so was your reaction.</p><p>The Fire Temple was worth the wait, though.</p><p>It wasn't massive the way Konoha was massive, being only a scattered handful of buildings, but it was <em> old</em> in the way that very few buildings here were. It was historical, had the weight of years in every stone and brick. It had been old before Konoha had ever been imagined.</p><p>And there was <em> so much chakra.</em></p><p>Enough that the background white noise of ambient chakra was like pounding surf instead. Still ambient, still natural, but so much more noticeable. The temple had to be built on a dragon vein. It had to. And even then…</p><p>And there was… more concentrated chakra in the walls surrounding it. Seals? Probably. Half the reason I'd come here was that they were famous for barrier seals. It seemed logical that their home would be covered with them. It was what I would do.</p><p>"Asuma!" A tall, bald man dressed in the white-and-black monk habit called, descending down from the gates to meet us on the road. He seemed glad but not surprised.</p><p>Actually, that was a pretty poor description – <em> all</em> the men I could see were tall and bald and wearing the same things. Even their chakra had a strange uniformity to it, something I was only used to feeling from clans.</p><p>Asuma-sensei waved. "Chiriku," he said. "It's good to see you again."</p><p>Chiriku – that was the monk that had been a member of the Twelve Guardian Ninja. He had the same Fire bandana that Asuma-sensei wore, marking his allegiance.</p><p>The two of them fell into step with an easy kind of comradery, unsurprised and unassuming, like they were friends who had just run into each other at the local ramen shop. I kept half an ear on their conversation, but mostly stared around the temple with a kind of wide-eyed fascination and fingers that itched to run over all the walls.</p><p>"-this is Shikako Nara," Asuma-sensei said, sounding amused enough that he probably knew. "She's interested in studying here for a short time."</p><p>I turned my attention back to them and bowed as politely as I could, clasping my hands in front of me. "Jiraiya-sama recommended you very highly," I said, which wasn't actually a lie. I was also completely ready to shamelessly namedrop if it helped me get what I wanted. I had the feeling Jiraiya would only approve of that.</p><p>"Is that so?" Chiriku asked, mildly and giving no hint as to what he thought of that. It was very serene. Monk-like. "What kind of things are you interested in studying?"</p><p>"Fuuinjutsu," I said, easily. "Barrier seals, primarily, but I enjoy learning anything that's available." I hesitated a fraction, but there wasn't really an option to learn by stealth, so I'd have to front up. "Jiraiya-sama also suggested that I seek your guidance in learning about natural energy."</p><p>That was a roundabout way of putting it, for sure, but I felt like coming out saying 'teach me to be a sage' was expecting a bit much.</p><p>I felt like they got the subtext anyway, with the way Asuma-sensei was staring at me.</p><p>"That's-"Chiriku hesitated for the briefest of moments. "-hardly a topic that can be mastered in so short a period of time."</p><p>I nodded, diffidently. "I understand that," I said, trying to balance between earnest and <em> earnest</em> . One was good, the other was too much. "I didn't expect that I would be able to <em> master</em> it." I didn't really expect that I would be told very much about it at all – but I'd take what I could get.</p><p>But at least it seemed agreed upon that I was staying, even if it hadn't been said in so many words.</p><p>Asuma-sensei delivered the mission missive and stayed to drink and reminisce with Chiriku, but I was funneled off towards the younger monks. The students. Trainees? Initiates? Whatever they were called.</p><p>It was a little awkward. Very 'first day of school' where you <em> know</em> that everyone around you knows each other and has already formed lifelong friendships.</p><p>"Sora," Chiriku said, singling out a single novice. "Please help Shikako get settled. She will begin with the first group in the morning."</p><p>Sora was approximately the same age as me; pale skinned and dark haired. He seemed vaguely annoyed at the instruction – or just vaguely annoyed in general – but accepted his orders with deference.</p><p>"Come with me," he said, turning without waiting to see if I would, and stalking off towards what I presumed were the living quarters. "The first group are the newest novices," he said, a touch of superiority lightening his face.</p><p>"That makes sense," I said, neutrally, pretty sure there was some kind of catch there. "Seeing as how I'm new."</p><p>Sora let me settle into the 'guest' accommodations. Apparently people wanting to come and experience temple lifestyle wasn't an <em> entirely</em> unknown thing. They were pretty plain and Spartan but it wasn't like I had any kind of high standards. I could, would, and did sleep outside in the dirt when required.</p><p>The gongs rang early the next morning as a wakeup call but I'd expected that. And I'd been willingly doing five am mornings for a long time so I kept any and all complaints to myself, trying to look bright eyed and bushy tailed. It helped that I didn't really know what was going to happen or what was expected of me, so I <em> had</em> to be alert.</p><p>Sora found me with the same expression of annoyance he was wearing yesterday. "This way," he said, with a jerk of his head. "The first group meets in the lower courtyard."</p><p>I followed him and found about twenty novices lining up in rows of five, in front of a single monk. It reminded me of academy practices, really, and I doubted I was too far from the mark there because it was pretty easy to see what the 'catch' was, that he'd been setting me up for.</p><p>Not a single one of them would have been older than seven. The youngest were probably five.</p><p>"The newest novice begins in the lowest ranked position," Sora said, gesturing to the back of the rows. He tucked his hands into his sleeves, in a way that might have looked wise and placid if he hadn't been smirking.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at him, pretty much unaffected. Did he think I would be bothered? Humiliated? Humble-iated? "I went through my ninja training with a class of five year olds too," I murmured.</p><p>His face dropped instantly into a scowl. Oh yeah, that was not a response he liked. "How old were you then?"</p><p>"Five," I answered blandly. "Does it make any difference?"</p><p>It did and it didn't. Either way, it didn't change what was happening now. I bowed politely to the instructor and took my place in the line, copying the posture of the other novices. Sora left, to go to whichever group he was with, and I waited patiently.</p><p>It was not so different to Academy training at all. We did warm up stretches and ran through basic techniques and short sequences of moves. They were unfamiliar to me, but I was a <em> Nara</em> and we were mimics, very used to noticing how people were moving and reflecting back actions. It wasn't anything like the preternatural sharingan learning but in a controlled learning environment like this I didn't need anyone to correct my stances.</p><p>There was no sparring – I presumed that it would come later – and since I was working with five year olds it wasn't exactly anything I would have called intensive exercise. After the training there was a period of … well, of kneeling and bowing and chanting. Basically. It was interesting in a way, listening to the monks reciting, voices layering over and over each other from different places in the temple, not quite in synch but not out of it either.</p><p>And then we all scurried off to do pre-breakfast chores and breakfast making. The kids all went about it with a sense of calm routine, unhurried and a little bored. I gamely kept up, ferrying bowls and plates around and tried to find a place in the choreographed chaos of the entire order being fed.</p><p>After breakfast there was mediation – Shikantaza, 'silent sitting' which sounded exactly like a Nara name should - so we trouped out to a small building a small distance from the main temple. It was long and narrow, with only three walls and open at the front to overlook the valley and lake below.</p><p>It honestly reminded me of a bus stop more than anything.</p><p>Still, the view was pretty, and it gave me something to look at while I sat in seiza and stayed calm and still. We were far enough away from the temple that we couldn't hear anything, which gave the illusion that we were more isolated than we really were. The instructor paced in measured footsteps in front of us, meeting any fidgeting or snoring with a swift correct from his keisaku stick.</p><p>And so went the rest of the day; I stuck with the first group for chores and training, but thankfully skipped out of the more ordinary lessons. Sora came to drag me to other places to fill in those blocks of time; theology was interesting, but only in as much as it would allow me to decipher their seals and not because I had any real desire to become a monk myself.</p><p>The day was strictly regimented, more so than even the Academy had been. It wasn't <em> bad</em> but it was surely an adjustment to make after so long of having the freedom to choose what I did all day.</p><p>The next day was the same and so was the one after that. I started to fall into the rhythm of it, started to know where I was going and what I was doing without having to just follow along.</p><p>Life in the Temple was… it felt insulated. Everything that happened, it happened <em> here</em> with little connection to the outside world. Even in the first week I felt cut off, like I wouldn't know if anything happened in Konoha. Realistically I knew that messages would get through – either via hawk or by sending a ninja as a messenger – and it wasn't like we ever stayed in touch while we were on missions.</p><p>It just felt different. Like I was out of touch, out of step, out of place. But there was plenty to do – I had access to the libraries, to all the monks who spent their lives maintaining the seals of the temple. I had <em> plenty</em> to learn.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"The senior monks are meditating in the interior courtyard after dinner," Sora told me, with the same kind of formal stiffness and near distaste that seemed to be his trademark. "You've been invited to watch."</p><p>"Thank you," I said, though I wasn't exactly sure what that meant. I presumed it was something <em> other</em> than the regular meditation we all seemed to do, or that there would be something to watch and a reason for said invitation.</p><p>Meditation was not, generally speaking, considered a spectator sport.</p><p>Apparently something about this was, however, because after dinner the inner courtyard was ringed with spectators. Everyone kept a very respectful perimeter, quiet and out of the way, and I knelt down beside Sora trying to keep my confusion to myself.</p><p><em> Wait and watch. </em> That was pretty much the watchwords of the temple. They were all about 'patience' and 'in good time'.</p><p>Chiriku was leading the other senior monks. It wasn't 'meditation' like the silent meditation we'd been practising, but closer to the ritual prayers that were held several times a day.</p><p>However interesting it was to watch, it still took me a long time to see the point.</p><p>Or rather, to feel it.</p><p>I hadn't been focusing on my chakra sense while I'd been here – and that was my mistake. My personal bias blinding me to what was going on. These weren't ninja but they <em> were </em> trained chakra users and I should have been paying more attention. But I hadn't. I'd been focused on the <em> seals</em> , on the things I knew had power, and ignored the things I considered 'just religion'.</p><p>Stupid. <em> There are more things in this world than are dreamed of in your philosophy.</em></p><p>I'd even noticed it when I'd arrived. I'd thought 'these monks all have strangely similar chakra'. I knew there were ways that a person could change their chakra signature, because I – we, the Nara – did it to our spiritual energy.</p><p>And that was pretty much what the monks were doing now. They were cycling their chakra, <em> harmonising it</em> , either consciously or unconsciously in time with the ritual they were performing together. And on each cycle they became a little more similar, a little closer to whatever kind of baseline they were trying to achieve.</p><p>It wasn't just this one exercise; no, everything they did in the temple was bound to be work towards this result. Everyone learnt the same way, everyone learnt the same things and did the same activities and ate the same and slept at the same time – they were all learning to think the same.</p><p>And this was why.</p><p>I could see it with Chiriku – the way his chakra flattened and <em> settled, </em> the way it spread out becoming something larger than his body and fuzzed at the edges, blurring into the world around it.</p><p>And I couldn't tell where he stopped and the chakra of the temple started.</p><p>Chiriku was the man sitting at the head of the monks. And Chiriku was the formless bodiless chakra surrounding us all. The chakra of the temple and the chakra of the monks was one and the same.</p><p><em> Of course.</em></p><p>The Fire Temple had been here, on this dragon vein, for how many hundreds of years? How many thousands of monks had lived here, breathed here, meditated and expended chakra in exactly the same pattern, seeking peace and nirvana and imprinting themselves upon the natural energy of the temple?</p><p>I was thinking of energy as if it were some blank and lifeless thing. But it wasn't, of course it wasn't. The natural energy in Land of Snow had been <em> cold, </em> had been keeping the land in eternal winter. Gelel had been <em> alive.</em></p><p>The monks had been tending to the energy of the Temple like it was a garden. Like it was a bonsai tree – slowly, slowly pruning and coaxing until it grew in the same patterns they did. Until they were in sync with it, on whatever level.</p><p>All this I thought, watching them breathe calmly and quietly. The natural energy of the temple swayed in rhythm, in and out like the tide, condensing down and down until it was a visible golden glow around the bodies of the men.</p><p>"The Welcoming Approach," Sora murmured, very quietly and in awe, like he hadn't really meant to speak.</p><p><em> Sage mode.</em></p><p>This was why the Fire Temple had survived where even ninja clans hadn't –why it would take immortal S-rank ninja to even breach their walls.</p><p>And also… why it would take decades of dedicated study to master this. To even approach <em> use</em> of this technique.</p><p>I couldn't do it. Didn't have time. And even if I had… I would still look for another way. Because, like the chakra armour from the Land of Snow, this technique relied on the world around it. These monks were at their greatest here, in their stronghold, with their equals surrounding them.</p><p>It was not a technique for a ninja that walked over the world. It wouldn't be nearly so strong anywhere else.</p><p>Disappointment bubbled in my stomach, but I looked at it and let it go. I had so much more to consider now, so much more to study and try and fit into my worldview.</p><p>"Amazing," I said, voice just as quiet and awed.</p><p>Sora glanced at me sideways and smiled, like we had just shared something.</p><p><hr /></p><p>One of the other - really fascinating - skills of the Fire Temple was the ritual ninjutsu which was some sort of hybrid of sealing and ninjutsu. Or group fuuinjutsu? Which was something I knew of in context of medical sealing, but less so outside of it. Seals were hard enough on their own without adding in the complication of getting different people synchronized enough to use them together.</p><p>Which was probably another way that the monastery lifestyle helped out, come to think of it.</p><p>"Destruction of Evil Seal!" The eight monks snapped into place, forming an octagon, and a web of glowing seal script spread out from their feet, joining like a snowflake in the middle.</p><p>I watched it, tilting my head curiously. "So," I asked, "does having more people involved make the seal stronger or weaker?"</p><p>"A good question," the elderly monk next to me said with a hum. And no actual answer to it. I was getting used to that. It was very Kakashi-sensei – though actually he usually answered a question when it was directly posed to him and he wasn't <em> just</em> trying to be obnoxious.</p><p>"I can see it going both ways," I continued, out loud. "More people means that individually you only have to focus on a small fraction of the seal. There's less to memorize and calculate. The more small chunks you can break the seal down into, the more people you get involved, the easier it is for each individual person to cast."</p><p>He hummed again.</p><p>In front of us, the seal wavered.</p><p>"On the other hand," I went on, "the more people involved, to more points of failure you're introducing to the system. It only takes one mistake to collapse the whole thing, and now you're relying on eight people to do little things perfectly rather than one person to do a lot perfectly."</p><p>"Both those things are true," the monk agreed. "So what answer do you have?"</p><p>I sighed. Neither of those points were exactly mutually exclusive. Or rather 'stronger' and 'weaker' were the wrong words to describe it. It was <em> quicker to learn</em> if you only had to learn a fraction of it, which made it more accessible and easier to use. But introducing more people introduced more weaknesses to the process. And it meant you had to have all those people around to use it. Which was another reason most ninja tended to lean towards solo techniques.</p><p>It was better <em> and</em> it was worse. It just depended on what part you were looking at.</p><p><hr /></p><p>AN: This chapter did not go anywhere near where it was supposed to, but people have been getting very antsy for updates, so here it is. Sora's arc may or may not come back later, I don't know, but it really didn't fit here.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Luckily this was nearly finished, because Pokemon Sun and Moon just came out. Guess what I'll be playing 24/7 for the next few weeks. XD.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 122</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Then leaf subsides to leaf.</p><p>So Eden sank to grief,</p><p>So dawn goes down to day.</p><p>Nothing gold can stay. ~ Robert Frost</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Coming back to Konoha was a little bit like stepping into a heavy metal concert after a month of listening to whale song.</p><p>It was loud. It jangled on my senses with a crush of overwhelming information, so many discordant notes that there was no way to make sense of them.</p><p>The Fire Temple had been a single entity, a conglomerate of serenity and balance and quiet, centered strength. Konoha was nothing like that. Konoha was not an entity. Konoha was a handful of places where chakra bleed into the ground, a hundred actions repeated until they left a mark, a thousand people marching out of time.</p><p>Here, at the gates, the Chunin on guard, leaving entrenched pillars of boredom-focus-wariness. The shinobi and civilians waiting to enter, breathing chakra into the air, tinging the spot with anticipation-nervousness-exhaustion. The walls themselves, laid with seals and traps and echoing chakra-enhanced footsteps. The ghosts of body flickers, hanging in the air, slowly fading.</p><p>"Tadaima," I murmured, too quietly to be heard and brushed my hands against the gate. There was no spirit of Konoha, no kami, no god, not yet. But there might be, one day. And until then… until then, there might be smaller spirits, places within the whole that had enough strength and cohesion to become something.</p><p>Home was… quieter.</p><p>It felt like <em> us.</em> Like mum and dad and Shikamaru and me, our chakra leeching into the space over years and years of living there, until the house was soaked in it.</p><p>Comforting. Familiar. A little oppressive.</p><p>"I'm home," I said, even though they'd looked up the instant that the front door had opened.</p><p>"Shikako!" Shikamaru said, moving towards me even as I shucked my shoes and dropped my backpack. "You're back already?"</p><p>I laughed and hugged him. "What, you didn't miss me?" I teased. "It's been a month."</p><p>"I thought we'd have to pry you out of the temple library," he grumbled, leaning back a bit. "Asuma-sensei said he didn't even see you after you got there."</p><p>"That's because he was busy drinking with his old buddies," I shot back. "No fault of mine."</p><p>Mum levered herself up off of the sofa and I hugged her too, a little more awkwardly. "Wow," I said, eyeing her stomach. It certainly looked… more than it had when I'd gone. Obvious. Very obvious.</p><p>She huffed a laugh. "Only about six weeks to go," she said, patting it lightly.</p><p>"So, how was it?" he asked. "Anything happen?"</p><p>I collapsed onto the sofa with a sigh, waiting till they settled back in. "Good," I said, very eloquently and descriptively. "It was quiet. Peaceful. We did a lot of meditation. I didn't get through nearly as many books as I wanted, but I have so many <em> ideas!</em> I'll have to go back at some point!"</p><p>"Sounds super fun," Shikamaru deadpanned.</p><p>I kicked a leg in his general direction and utterly failed to connect. "Shut up. I mean, some point in the distant future. It was pretty boring," I admitted after a second, feeling a little disloyal for it. "They were nice and all but it was… it wasn't the same." I sat up, straightening. "So, how're things here?"</p><p>Shikamaru hesitated a fraction of a second. "Asuma-sensei thinks I'm combat ready again," he said. "He thinks we could get Team 10 back together for a few missions."</p><p>"Oh yeah?" I asked, trying to conceal my surprise. I wasn't even sure what I was surprised about – that Shikamaru <em> was</em> ready, or that he wasn't <em> already</em> ready. Had I been assuming that he was already taking missions again? I hadn't even really thought much about it. "That's good, right?"</p><p>Shikamaru huffed. "I guess." He shrugged. "I just don't want it to go wrong."</p><p>Which was… a fair point, considering the last time a mission had gone wrong on him he'd lost an arm.</p><p>I bit back my initial response of <em> no one wants missions to go wrong</em> and <em> sometimes you have to take that risk</em> as being things he would already know and unhelpful. "Well, your team would be with you," I settled on. "Between Ino and Chouji you probably won't have much to worry about."</p><p>I didn't know whether that helped, but conversation turned to less intense catching up, so that was some kind of success.</p><p>I spent a quiet afternoon at home, working on drafting some papers for the clan library. Because I'd been on a 'training trip' I was technically expected to be able to show some form of results from that. My sensory skills probably counted, but they were harder to demonstrate, and my seals would still need a fair amount of testing and refining to complete.</p><p><em> Practices of the monks of the Fire Temple </em> and<em> Techniques for the Sealing of Evil; on the Ritual Ninjutsu of the Fire Temple</em> weren't exactly full of groundbreaking stuff – despite the name, it was more an overview than actual techniques – but it was information that wasn't present in the clan library right now. I knew because I'd looked before I'd gone.</p><p><em> On the Chakra and the Natural Energy of the World</em> was harder because I was a lot more tentative in the information that I had. I wasn't even entirely sure that I wanted to put this information out there. At the same time, I really wanted to organize my thoughts and every time I tried I just kept getting more and more tangled.</p><p>Which was why, when dad came home he found me staring very intently at a candle flame, occasionally moving my hand in front of the light.</p><p>"Meditating?" he asked, after we'd completed the 'welcome home' song and dance.</p><p>"Sort of," I said, gesturing at the scattered papers and pens around me. "Uh okay. So. Nature of chakra. Shadow Possession Jutsu works mostly through spiritual connection, right? That's how we get people to mimic us. But it occurred to me to wonder… what about when it's <em> not people</em> ?"</p><p>Dad looked… mostly blank, actually.</p><p>I forged onwards. "We use natural forming shadows to extend our reach all the time. We interact with them; our chakra fills their limits and it adds to our jutsu. We gain something from them. Mostly we just assume that's the <em> physical</em> side of the technique – except we never treat shadows as 'just' a physical thing. They're a reflection, a mirror; they're <em> spiritual.</em> "</p><p>"There wouldn't be…anything to reflect," Dad said slowly. "If there are no people involved."</p><p>"Wouldn't there?" I asked, though rhetorically. "I wonder… but, anyway, even if it's not a direct spiritual influence, there's so much more that could be going on. Would the shadow of a tree be different to the shadow of a rock? What about shadow cast by fire to that cast by lightning?"</p><p>"That's very philosophical," he replied.</p><p>"No, practical," I insisted, moving my hands animatedly like I could produce proof out of thin air. "If there <em> is</em> a difference, that affects the jutsu. What if I could use shadow that has the resilience of stone? Could I imbue the technique with the… the destructive power of lightning? If there is a connection, if there is an impact, or a way to combine spiritual and elemental affinities- "</p><p>I cut myself off.</p><p>We stared at the candle together for a very long moment, the silence stretching.</p><p>"I have no idea," Dad said, honestly.</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed, unsurprised but maybe a little disappointed. I obviously had never heard about anything like this before, but that didn't mean that no one in our clan history had ever thought of it or tried. "It was just a thought, anyway."</p><p>"It's worth looking into, regardless," Dad said, squeezing my shoulder. "Philosophical or practical."</p><p>"I'll add it to my list," I said wryly.</p><p><hr /></p><p>After dinner, dad took Shikamaru and I out onto the veranda and attempted to hammer some aspect of village law into our heads.</p><p>It wasn't that either of us were <em> bad students</em> as much as… totally unenthusiastic about it. That hadn't changed, despite our new responsibilities and promotions. I might have even been <em> less</em> enthusiastic about it now, when I had so much else to do, stuff that always seemed to be higher priority. And while I found the <em> theoretical aspects</em> of clan responsibilities interesting enough, I had no real desire to be involved in the implementation of them. I didn't want to have to lead, I didn't want to have to come up with new systems for whatever we were being asked to do, or to streamline process or try increase medicine production.</p><p>Shikamaru could have it all.</p><p>"Can't I just finish this?" I asked, distractedly scribbling in a notebook. "Shikamaru is the only one who really needs to know it, anyway."</p><p>"No," Shikamaru answered. "If I have to, you have to."</p><p>Dad looked pretty unamused and not in the way that said he was secretly amused by our bickering. "You might have to run a clan one day, so yes, you have to," he said. "Tough it out."</p><p>I sighed and acquiesced.</p><p>I didn't get any happier when I realized that the topic had 'War Operations' stamped all over. (Literally, it had a formal header from the tower listing the department.) They were slowly but surely refining legislation, changing clan responsibilities and restructuring protocols and emergency response drills. It added to the feeling that Konoha was very seriously preparing – that our general state of readiness wasn't going to be good enough for what was coming next.</p><p>And it was really dense and required a lot of unpacking to see what they actually wanted to change.</p><p>So, I was incredibly relieved when I felt Sasuke's chakra at the door. "Oh! Sasuke's here. I'll get that," I said, and bounced away before they could stop me.</p><p>"Hey," Sasuke said, only blinking when I yanked the door open before he had a chance to knock. "Heard you were back."</p><p>"Just today," I said, letting him in. "What's up?"</p><p>Sasuke stuck his hands in his pockets and shrugged. "Kakashi-sensei is in the hospital," he said. "Chakra exhaustion."</p><p>"Again?" I asked, rhetorically. I headed back outside, Sasuke falling into step beside me with easy familiarity. Shikamaru would probably appreciate the excuse to take a break as well, and dad might even let us get away with it if Sasuke stuck around. "I'll go visit him tomorrow."</p><p>Sasuke… hesitated, shoulder twitching in another aborted shrug. "It's bad," he said. "Hokage-sama says it's bad."</p><p>I frowned, just a little uneasy. "But," I started, then stopped. "But I thought he wasn't taking missions?"</p><p>"No," Sasuke agreed. "I mean, I don't know but… I don't know what happened. Shikako… I think it's <em> bad.</em> "</p><p>And he looked <em> worried</em> in the way that Sasuke did where it was mostly exasperation and apprehension. I reached out and touched his arm. "Hey," I said softly. "We'll go visit him tomorrow and sort it out. I'm sure it's just sensei being dumb, okay?"</p><p>Sasuke huffed and rolled his eyes. "Yeah, that's a thing," he agreed. But he looked calmer, more centered.</p><p>"Nice of you to stop by, Sasuke," dad said dryly. "I'm sure Shikako appreciates your timing."</p><p>I smiled, a little sheepishly, because yeah dad knew what the game was.</p><p>"Sorry to interrupt," Sasuke said, awkwardly looking off to the side.</p><p>Dad waved it off, and then seemed to regard him with contemplative look, as if he were considering something. "You might as well stay," he said at length. "You'll probably need to know this at some point, too. And maybe you can make these two pay attention."</p><p>I sank back down with a sigh. "I'm paying attention," I grumbled. "War bad. Clan work hard. Need many medicine."</p><p>Dad covered his face with his hand. "Very… succinct," he managed to say.</p><p>Sasuke took a seat next to me, cautiously. "What are you looking at?" he asked, eying the papers scattered between us.</p><p>"Resource management in event of an official declaration of war," Shikamaru said dryly. "What a drag."</p><p>"Okay, from the start-" Dad said, and there we went again.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The hospital was as the hospital always was and Kakashi-sensei looked no worse than the myriad of other times I'd visited him there.</p><p>"I thought the point of taking the War Op. role was that you wouldn't end up here as often," I said dryly.</p><p>"I overdid it a little," Sensei said, shrugging it off, "you know how it goes."</p><p>The easy admittance bothered me, somehow.</p><p>"Sasuke was awfully worried about you," I said, idly, and watched as his shoulders hunched incrementally forward.</p><p>"Ah," he said, focusing very intently on anything in the room that wasn't me.</p><p>I frowned. I hadn't been worried, but now, I kinda was. I stole the treatment notes off the end of his bed but they only said what I expected them to. Chakra exhaustion.</p><p>"The fire temple was very good," I offered, changing tact. Circling like a shark looking for an opening. "Very quiet. Lots of meditating. Lots of reading. You'd probably like it."</p><p>Some of the tension faded. "Sounds like it," he agreed. "I hope you did some training while you were there, too."</p><p>"After all the effort you went to to send me there?" I parried. "Of course. And I'm looking forward to doing more now that I'm back, too." I gave him an angelic look that was full of hints.</p><p>Under the mask, his lips twisted up, but he glanced away. "I can call in some more favours," he said, voice exactly as light and teasing as it should have been. "Gai promised to help you with your terrible grappling. And Tenzou knows more than a few earth jutsu. He'll say 'no' at first but he's weak to guilt trips."</p><p>And that was… code fucking red. Actually, there had been a lot of code reds, and the more I looked back the more of them I was starting to realise I had missed.</p><p>"I told you it was bad," Sasuke grumbled from the doorway. His hands were in his pockets and he was scowling.</p><p>We hadn't agreed on a meeting time, or said when we were going to be here, but the fact that Sasuke and I turned up within minutes of each other anyway really did say something about us. And it meant that if Sasuke was worried, I should be too.</p><p>I looked at Kakashi. In a lot of ways... I didn't want to ask. I didn't want to know. I was happy to let Kakashi be Kakashi, to deal with his own issues how he wanted. But Sasuke was worried. I had to at least address that.</p><p>"What happened?" I asked, forgoing casual to just directly <em> ask.</em></p><p>Kakashi-sensei looked uncomfortably. "I just overdid it a little," he repeated. "It's nothing for you kids to get so worried about." His eye curved into a smile.</p><p>Kakashi was admitting to overdoing something. He'd said that <em> twice.</em> Did anyone in our team ever admit to weakness, unless it was to cover another, even bigger, weakness?</p><p>"Sensei," I said, frowning. I tried to think of things he could be covering for. "We've been on missions with you. We've <em> seen</em> the types of jutsu it takes to exhaust you. You wouldn't be throwing those around in Konoha without a reason. Is something going on?"</p><p>Sasuke shifted uneasily, switching between his more casual concern and something that was more alert. Wary.</p><p>"No," Kakashi cleared his throat. "No, there's nothing like that." His hand twitched on the white sheets, fingers curling over.</p><p>"Just tell us," Sasuke said. There was something approximating an <em> order</em> in his tone. "We know something is going on. You know we'll find out eventually."</p><p>The room plunged into fraught silence. I closed my eyes, listened to the bustle of the hospital around us. Breathed calmly and sensed the medics moving around, the green calming sense of Tsunade nearby on her rounds, heading this way. The hospital was a bustle of overlapping chakra – bursts of healing jutsu, the steady pulse of monitoring seals, the bracing protection of its defenses – and the lingering tastes of so many repetitive actions – some of them tinged with fear and pain, but so many more of the steady determination of the medics.</p><p>"What was the surgery that Tsunade wanted you to have, sensei?" I asked quietly.</p><p>"Surgery?" Sasuke echoed, looking sharply between us.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei tensed, shoulders as tight as an overdrawn bowstring… and then snapped like one. "I can't," he said, voice low.</p><p>I moved forward, perching myself on the end of the bed next to his feet. It was the time for closeness now. The posturing was over. The defenses had been lowered. Mostly. For this topic. As much as they ever would be.</p><p>"The chakra exhaustion comes from the sharingan," Kakashi said, running a hand over his face in exhaustion. His fingers rested on the jut of his eye socket, underneath the aforementioned eye.</p><p>That wasn't anything we hadn't suspected already.</p><p>"You've had it for years," I pointed out. "It's not like…" not like he didn't know how to cope with it, how to make allowances for the drain, like that was any kind of new information.</p><p>"It's getting worse."</p><p>Sasuke and I looked at each other. I frowned.</p><p>"Worse, how?" Sasuke asked, uneasily. "Why?"</p><p>Sensei just stared at us, single eye drooping tiredly, ignoring the questions. "The Hokage wants to remove it."</p><p>I… absorbed that but I didn't… didn't process it, not exactly. Kakashi-sensei was the sharingan. He was Kakashi <em> of the</em> Sharingan. He was Kakashi the Copy Ninja. Kakashi of the Thousand Jutsu.</p><p>None of those things were accidental. They weren't… just <em> chance.</em> The legend had been built deliberately, purposefully, so that the sharingan was an incontrovertible part of his story. I'd seen Kakashi-sensei fight with the Sharingan, against Zabuza, in the Land of Snow, the way he'd used the eye to mirror his opponent – and the fact was, there were smarter, better ways to fight. You didn't fight water with water. You fought it with lightning. And he was perfectly capable of that.</p><p>But he didn't. Because he was <em> of the Sharingan</em> . He was one last part of his teammates legacy. He was using that gift to the best of his ability, maybe not in the way it had been intended, but in a way that was <em> known.</em></p><p>He would never allow it to be removed.</p><p>"Re-implantation has a 40% chance of success," Tsunade said mildly, sliding open the door and entering the room like she'd just been waiting for a moment like that. Maybe she had been. She'd practically challenged me to ask about this, last time we'd been here. "And a 60% chance of improving your chronic chakra drain if successful."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei gave her the same bland look he had then. I wondered how many times they'd had this conversation. How low <em> 40%</em> sounded, when it was something more important than-</p><p>"What happens," I asked, very, very slowly, "if he doesn't have the surgery?"</p><p>"Medical information is confidential," Tsunade said primly and then stared, laser eyed at Kakashi-sensei. She wanted him to tell us. She wanted us to protest. To argue.</p><p>She thought we could change his mind. She'd tried to use me to make this point, weeks ago but I hadn't wanted… hadn't wanted to be involved.</p><p>"Hypothetically," I rephrased. "A medical case. A shinobi with an implanted sharingan refuses to have it removed. What happens."</p><p>"Hypothetically," she said dryly, "that shinobi has already been removed from several facets of active duty. Hypothetically that shinobi was given what should have been a low stress role in teaching a genin team. Hypothetically that shinobi shouldn't be using chakra. Hypothetically, that shinobi has another six months to a year before the rate of chakra drain exceeds production."</p><p>Sasuke sat down in the visitor's chair, very carefully and very controlled. His hands were fisted with white knuckles on his knees.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei looked out the window.</p><p><em> But</em> , I thought<em> , that's not what happened.</em></p><p>That wasn't what happened. Kakashi had been there, in the later parts of the story, and stronger than ever. He hadn't… hadn't faded away and died.</p><p>Had he had the surgery? Risked it and come out stronger – sharingan re-implanted and fixed?</p><p>If so, why was he hesitating <em> now</em> ?</p><p>"Are you going to have the surgery?" I asked.</p><p>"No," Kakashi-sensei said, and it sounded defeated. "No. Please don't ask me to."</p><p>I didn't... I didn't necessarily agree. To face death for a legacy. To cling tightly to something that could be fixed, even if it was a sacrifice. To not fight for survival, for just one more day, just a little bit more.</p><p>It was <em> stupid</em> .</p><p>But he said <em> please</em> .</p><p>(In the back of my mind I knew... if it came down to it, to the crunch time, to the point of no return... I would argue it. I would poke and prod and convince, no matter how little he wanted it, because I wanted him to die even less. He'd hate it, maybe resent me for it, but I'd do it. But it wasn't crunch time yet.)</p><p>Had this even happened, in that other life, in that story? Or had there been another solution? Something that was supposed to have happened but hadn't?</p><p>There was so much I didn't know. All I knew was that <em> Kakashi-sensei didn't die like this.</em></p><p>I closed my eyes. Considered the situation from all those angles. There had to be another option, then. Another choice. Another path. We just had to find it.</p><p>"I'm going to need your medical records," I decided, then looked at Sasuke. "And whatever your clan has on the sharingan. And we'll need… Sakura. We'll need Sakura to help us."</p><p>Maybe Sakura was the key. Tsunade's brilliant apprentice – maybe the reason it had never been mentioned was that she would have noticed this sooner, found a way to fix it.</p><p>"You think you can find something I didn't?" Tsunade asked, arching an eyebrow. "You'll need a miracle."</p><p>"Then we'll make one," Sasuke said, rising to his feet. He had a goal now and there was fire in his eyes. Sasuke always worked better with a goal. "I'll find what I can. And tell Sakura to meet you here."</p><p>Tsunade crossed her arms and huffed. "I'd be insulted," she said, "if I even thought there was a <em> possibility</em> that it was something so simple. I've been over this. The whole hospital has been over this for years. This is the best, the only, possible treatment. All he has to do is agree."</p><p>"You know he's not going to, right?" It was too bold and too blunt and too true. And yeah, maybe I didn't think it was right – to place a legacy above <em> survival</em> , above keeping going and trying more and <em> living</em> – but it wasn't my choice to make. "Maybe there's nothing. Maybe we're just wasting our time. But we're going to try. You don't lose anything by letting us try."</p><p>She sighed. "You'll have to authorize access, Kakashi," she said. "And no one is to <em> try</em> any kind of treatment without a medical ninja present. A <em> fully qualified</em> medical ninja. Actually, you'll run it past me before you try anything at all."</p><p>She swept out of the room, leaving me with Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>"You can try," he said, quietly. "But don't… if it doesn't work… you have to know…"</p><p>"<em> We</em> can try," I corrected. "Don't think you're getting out of doing any work, sensei. I'm going to make you complicit in saving yourself."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hospital Arc: Chapter 123</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Okay, so, some of you have been around since the start of the fic, and some of you might have scrolled up to see, but it should be pretty obvious that DOS is old as balls by now. It was started long before canon was finished – as such, there are things that were 'revealed' and/or retconned into canon that aren't in DOS. I try to make things clear in the narrative, but since it's relevant to this arc and hard to show in story, I just want to clear it up. Obito is deader than doornails. He was a bright, idealistic kid in the middle of a bloody war that didn't care. But he left a really lasting impression on Kakashi.</p><p>(Other examples of Sir Not Appearing In This Fic: Kaguya. Asura. Indra. Romance. That weird chakra tree thing.)</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 123</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> It's always too early to quit. ~ Norman Vincent Peale</p><p></em></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Okay," I said, clambering back onto the foot of Kakashi-sensei's hospital bed with my pile of books. "Project; Miracle is a go."</p><p>Sakura giggled, covering her mouth with her hand delicately. "Do you give all your missions codenames?"</p><p>"That's not actually a thing," I said, trying to organize myself. A hospital room didn't exactly make for a great base of operations, but we worked with what we had. "Missions are just missions."</p><p>"They do in War Operations," Kakashi-sensei said, seriously. "There's a prize for whoever can come up with the best names."</p><p>"Really?" I asked, intrigued. I was a little surprised – more that he was telling us than that there was a competition, to be honest. That sounded exactly like something ninja would do.</p><p>He smiled, eye crinkling. "No."</p><p><em> No, there wasn't a competition or no, they didn't name them? </em> I huffed in exasperation and then let it go, knowing that Kakashi-sensei was probably just trying to deliberately wind me up because he was in a terribly uncomfortable situation and couldn't escape.</p><p>Yep, that boded really well for how this was going to go.</p><p>"So where do we start?" Sasuke asked, impatiently cutting through the byplay.</p><p><em> Good question.</em> "Well," I said, "did you find any Uchiha records?"</p><p>He shrugged, a bit uncomfortably. "I don't know what's in them. I have all the stuff you brought back from the outpost. And… there's more compound, if those turn up empty."</p><p>He didn't exactly seem eager to go through them, but I couldn't exactly blame him for that either. I wasn't sure if there would be anything in the outpost records – was that the sort of stuff you planned to move first?</p><p>"That'll probably be our biggest trump card," I said optimistically, "if we have access to information on the sharingan that the hospital doesn't."</p><p>You never really could underestimate clan knowledge hording. Even now, when it could be assumed that the hospital had aggregated enough data on us all, just from experience, there were cases when that just wasn't so. Like the Akimichi pills – Shikamaru had had to give Tsunade access to our clan encyclopedia for her to treat that.</p><p>"Shouldn't you give that to the hospital then?" Sakura asked, hesitantly. She glanced at Sasuke through her eyelashes. "We'd be really happy to have it!"</p><p>Sasuke crossed his arms and shot me a look that very plainly said <em> why Sakura. </em></p><p>I shot back a look that said <em> well do you know any other medics that are willing to help us solely on the basis of friendship and/or your pretty face.</em> I wasn't sure that it all translated but he probably got the gist of it.</p><p>"Anything we come up with will have to go through Tsunade anyway," I said to her question. "And it's not like the hospital will want to wade through a lot of irrelevant records to search for it. There just aren't enough medics for that."</p><p>"That's true," she acknowledged, wilting a little. "So, um, Kakashi-san, is there a reason why you won't have Shishou's surgery?"</p><p>I'd explained the situation to Sakura – what the issue was, what the <em> sharingan</em> was, even, because that wasn't really well known information in our generation and why it was important to us – but I hadn't exactly gone into depth about his reasons. I hadn't thought Sakura would out and out ask, but of course she would.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei sighed. "Tsunade wanted to just remove it outright. She only agreed to try re-implant it because I wouldn't agree." He looked away, out the window. "There's are a lot of things that could go wrong with the surgery. If it deactivates and they can't reactivate it. Or if the chakra paths collapse. If there's nerve damage. There's only a 40% chance that it will still work afterwards. And even then, if all of that is successful…." A tiny, fractional amount of frustration started to leech into his voice. "It might not even fix the issue."</p><p>Tsunade had said something like that, hadn't she? A 60% chance it would improve the chakra drain. But that was on top of the success of the surgery itself.</p><p>That probably wasn't the whole reason – I very much doubted it, in fact – but it was the <em> logical</em> reasoning, dry and factual, about the surgery itself. I didn't think anyone would ever get Kakashi-sensei to admit to <em> feelings related</em> reasons.</p><p>"So, if there are any viable alternatives, we should look for them," I said, smoothly trying to jog the conversation onwards. "Since none of us are actually-" trained in this, I nearly said then thought better of it, "-specialists, Sakura has kindly located the current medical textbooks for chakra systems and optometry. Ophthalmology." I considered the words. Which one was correct? "Eye stuff."</p><p>That did seem to break the tension in the room. "Eye stuff," Kakashi-sensei repeated in dry amusement. "I'm glad to know my team is so eloquent. Very reassuring."</p><p>I waggled a finger at him, not taking it to heart. "I'm the chakra expert, obviously. I've studied chakra, chakra systems, chakra development and chakra disorders, though admittedly not chronic chakra exhaustion. That'll be something new."</p><p>"That's right," Sasuke said, looking to the side like he was refreshing his memory. "I forgot you used to read all those boring books in class."</p><p>"Personal interest," I said with a shrug. "I still would but I've had more pressing matters to study since graduation." My focus had shifted outside the human body, to the things you could do with it instead.</p><p>I parceled out the books, including one to Kakashi who looked at it like he had no idea how to operate this fascinating device – the liar - and started in on it. Unfortunately for us, studying wasn't merely a case of reading through and instantly understanding how everything functioned and how to apply that.</p><p>I <em> had</em> studied something like this before – but not in depth. A generic overview of ocular structures, lens and rods and cones, as part of a physiology paper over a decade ago. It was better than nothing, but that didn't make it easy. I took many notes and scratched out diagrams and tried to hone an understanding that would help.</p><p>Sasuke flicked through a couple of the books with his sharingan on and then appeared to give up, instead pulling out the medical files that Tsunade had given us. There was still a lot blacked out and flat out missing, but hopefully it had the relevant information in it.</p><p>He struggled a bit with those too, asking for clarification on abbreviations and certain hospital vocabulary, until Sakura vanished and came back with a glossary. "Here you go, Sasuke-kun," she said, holding it out like an offering. "This might help?"</p><p>He took it a little stiffly. "Thank you, Sakura-san."</p><p>Even with the pretty formal honorific attached, she looked delighted.</p><p>We took a break for lunch and Sakura had to actually attend classes but by the time the end of visiting hours rolled around, my brain was swimming from the dry medical terminology. It didn't exactly feel like progress.</p><p>"Okay," I said, covering a yawn. "I think I've got some ideas. I want to take a look at the chakra drain issue, tomorrow. Do you think we could requisition a diagnostic chakra sensor?"</p><p>"Maybe?" Sakura said, but doubtfully, as though she didn't think it would work.</p><p>Yeah, me neither. I knew exactly what requisition lists were like. "Orrr…" I drawled. "I can steal one from the clan and bring it. And by 'steal one' I mean make a seal and pretend that it's official."</p><p>Sakura fidgeted. "Is that a good idea?" She asked nervously. "It <em> did</em> get you in trouble last time."</p><p>And this time I really would be using it for medical purposes. That wasn't just a 'misunderstanding' it was very much flying in the face of the rules.</p><p>I looked at Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>He shrugged, apathetically.</p><p>"Eh," I said. "As long as no one asks where our information came from or looks into it too closely, it should be fine."</p><p>"Okay," Sasuke said, standing and rolling his neck. His vertebrae gave an alarming crack. "Same again tomorrow then." He didn't seem particularly enthused, but the grim determined line to his mouth was still there so he wasn't bailing, just disappointed.</p><p>Yeah, we hadn't solved it yet. But that was asking a bit more than a <em> miracle</em> .</p><p>I packed up the books on the side table and was the last to leave when Kakashi-sensei gave a deep sigh.</p><p>"What is it?" I asked, pausing and looking at him quizzically.</p><p>"There's nothing to find," he said, looking out the window instead of at me. "You're wasting your time. You should be training."</p><p>I considered that. I considered that very deeply.</p><p>It was rude to hit someone that was already in hospital, wasn't it? Or was that just being efficient? He wouldn't have to go very far for treatment.</p><p>"No," I decided, out loud. "You don't get to do this."</p><p>His eye jumped to me, startled, because I wasn't following the script.</p><p>"Do you remember," I asked, "in Wave? When Zabuza had you trapped. You told me to go, like I was the one who would talk the others into leaving."</p><p>He snorted. "I remember how well <em> that</em> worked out," he said dryly.</p><p>"Exactly," I said. "We didn't give up then and we're not giving up now. And we told you not to give us stupid orders anymore, sensei. This counts. I'm not going to try and talk Sasuke out of helping you because <em> I don't want to.</em> We're going to keep looking, keep fighting." I looked at him, as if I could convey conviction with a stare alone. "And if, in the event that there's nothing to find, if… if you die, I'm going to be able to look at myself in the mirror and say 'I did everything I could'."</p><p>These days 'everything I could' was no small amount.</p><p>I was not <em> powerless.</em></p><p>"So, don't you <em> dare</em> ," I said.</p><p>He looked away. "I'm-" he hesitated for so long I didn't think he would continue. "I'm sorry."</p><p>It seemed like it cost him a lot to say that, to admit it. Everything about this was costing him. For a second, I nearly jumped on it, nearly said <em> so why won't you-</em></p><p>But that wasn't the right approach. This wasn't a fight I'd win with a head on tactic like that. I couldn't argue sensei into changing his mind. He had to do that himself. We'd work on this, show him how much we cared, that there were things to stick around for.</p><p>"I don't want your apology," I said, implacably. "I want you to live." I took a breath and went on. "You get to choose even if we don't like your choices. But so do we. And this is ours. It's for <em> us</em> ."</p><p>I didn't know if he understood what I was saying, but I thought he did. Probably more than he wanted to.</p><p>You did everything you could. And then you hoped it was enough.</p><p><hr /></p><p>By the time I arrived the next morning, Sasuke was already there and hard at work.</p><p>"I pulled out all the sharginan related information and graphed the incidents over time," he said, tapping a pen against his lips and squinting at the sheet of paper, sensei's medical files piled around him. "I thought they'd get more frequent but they don't."</p><p>"Good idea," I said approvingly. "Data analysis." We had no idea what we were doing, so it was simply a matter of throwing everything at the problem and seeing what stuck. I looked over his shoulder. "You might need to control for ... mission frequency? Extremity? Badness?" I tapped two fingers down, one at the point of implantation and one a bit further along. "This is the Third War and ... here to, say... here is going to be frequent high risk missions."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei stared at me, narrow eyed. "How do you know that?"</p><p>Those were his Anbu years. But... "Kyuubi attack to when you started testing Genin teams," I said, not blinking an eye. "The village would have been short staffed, and then you're one of the most elite ninja we have. It's pretty obvious."</p><p>Sasuke made a mark where I'd gestured. Most of the lines fell within it, which was probably because they were most of the time frame. "Hn," he said, displeased. "Maybe if I go by length of recovery."</p><p>"Maybe take the tomoe into account?" I suggested. "Do you remember if that changed anything for you?"</p><p>Sasuke squinted thoughtfully. "They came in in the middle of a fight so I couldn't really tell." He shrugged, a little helplessly. "But I don't think running the sharingan takes that much chakra for me. I notice it's activation, but that's because... I have to <em> activate</em> it."</p><p>I made a thoughtful hum. "If we can find a way to compare the two of you we might manage… something. I'll think on it." I had diagnostic jutsu, and my own chakra sense to rely on, but I didn't think there was any way to measure chakra drain for doujutsu. It wasn't like an external jutsu where you could measure the expenditure.</p><p>I settled in, taking some of the medical files and getting started.</p><p>"Oh," Sakura said, high and startled when she arrived. "I'm late! I'm sorry!"</p><p>"We didn't exactly agree on a start time, so you can't be late," I said, waving her off. "We're just all workaholics here."</p><p>"Oh, um," she fidgeted, tucking a strand of long loose hair behind her ear. "I brought bentos for lunch. For everyone. Since we had to go and get lunch yesterday, I thought it would be nice."</p><p>"That's very thoughtful," I said even though I was pretty sure <em> I</em> hadn't been the one to prompt the generosity. Sasuke conspicuously said nothing.</p><p>(This suspicion was <em> absolutely</em> borne out at lunch time when I opened it to find a salad absolutely layered in tomatoes. I sighed and flicked them all into Sasuke's bento box instead. He was perfectly happy with that arrangement.)</p><p>"Okay," I said, staring thoughtfully at the ceiling. "So, I put together that measurement seal."</p><p>"You mean the one you aren't supposed to be doing," Sakura clarified, a tinge of disapproval in her voice.</p><p>"Yeah, that one," I agreed vaguely in her direction. "I'm going to set that up and get a baseline reading and then see if I can refine it to focus on the sharingan chakra drain."</p><p>"Does this seal work?" Kakashi-sensei asked, peering over his book at me. I was pretty sure he'd given up reading the medical textbook and had just slotted Icha Icha inside it, but I didn't actually want to check.</p><p>"Of course," I said immediately. "Probably. I tested it on myself first. It should be fine."</p><p>I slapped the tag on my arm to demonstrate. My circulatory system completed the open circuit and it spun to life without needing to be fed; which was probably important if you were trying to measure chakra without consuming it. The outer circle spun, decreasing in speed until it settled.</p><p>Then it beeped.</p><p>"See?" I said, looking at the clearly displayed numbers. "Exactly like the machines."</p><p>Not bad for a mornings work, really.</p><p>"Impressive," Sasuke said, so very dryly, making it clear he really wasn't.</p><p>Yeah well, compared to combat seals it was nothing. And we already had devices that would do exactly the same thing, so it wasn't a break through either.</p><p>"It really is, isn't it?" Sakura said brightly, clapping her hands together. "That's really great Shikako!"</p><p>"You take it off and it resets," I said, peeling the tag off. "Viola. Also, just so we're clear. I'm a field ninja and accepting a seal from me is the same as accepting a weapon."</p><p>"Is that a declaration you need to make often?" Kakashi asked, looking at me oddly. "It <em> isn't</em> going to explode, right?"</p><p>I brushed it off. "Hospital rules," I said. "Don't worry about it. Just don't get me in trouble with Tsunade."</p><p>Still, Sensei applied it with good grace and Sasuke wrote it down, apparently filling in the role of scribe for us.</p><p>"We give it half an hour and measure again and then we can calculate the total chakra recovery rate," I said. "Which is actually the result of both recovery and drain. And then hopefully I can fix the seal to focus on the sharingan…" I trailed off because I was pretty sure I was starting to repeat myself here.</p><p>"I can run some diagnostic jutsu," Sakura offered, twisting her hands together. "I'm sure the medics already have, but maybe I'll see something?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei sighed. "If you must," he said, resigned. Which was actually good sport coming from a man that regularly fled the hospital to avoid check ups.</p><p>Sakura was brisk and professional, and while she was doing that, Sasuke let me run one on his eyes as well, activating them and turning them off on cue so I could feel the difference in the chakra flow.</p><p>It was interesting. The chakra pathways behind his eyes were far wider and more developed than, say, mine, but there wasn't anything particularly unusual about them. The surge of chakra when he activated the sharingan was large but brief and probably didn't equate to anything more than a D-rank jutsu. The flow after that was higher than resting state, but again, not particularly significant on its own.</p><p>"How long can you hold it?" I wondered. I could feel it <em> spinning,</em> not necessarily physically, it was an interesting feeling.</p><p>"I've never tried for longer than a battle," Sasuke said, then amended. "Or training. A couple of hours at most. But it wasn't because it was hard or anything."</p><p>I hmm'd thoughtfully.</p><p>"Some of the police used to have theirs active all day," Kakashi said quietly. "It was something we asked about, when it was implanted. They didn't think there would be any negative side effects."</p><p>Sasuke stiffened at the mention of his clan, but nodded, reluctantly.</p><p>"Your chakra pathways are a little enlarged and inflamed," Sakura said, "but nothing that should be causing large scale problems. Maybe a little bit of discomfort, but that's it."</p><p>"Chakra bleed off?" I asked, swapping places with her. Sasuke gave me an irritated look that I ignored.</p><p>"Nothing particularly noticeable," she said, shaking her head.</p><p>I ran through the handseals and settled my palms against sensei's temple, starting to parse through the feedback. Sakura was right, there seemed to be <em> irritation</em> around the pathways, but that was a thing that often happened to shinobi hands. Generally speaking, the cure was rest which wasn't exactly possible in this case.</p><p>The chakra usage was a little higher than it had been in Sasuke's case and I could <em> almost</em> feel where the join had been made because there was a jolt like a missed step and chakra began to bleed out a little more afterwards. That wasn't exactly uncommon either – chakra didn't just stay in the coils, it permeated the entire body.</p><p>None of it felt like <em> enough.</em></p><p>Which was what the second tag measurement told us, as well.</p><p>"That's ... weird," I said, the catchphrase of a research ninja stumbling across an anomaly.</p><p>Everyone leaned over to look at my calculations. "What?"</p><p>"Sakura," I asked, slowly, "What's the average chakra recovery rate?"</p><p>"Two to three days," she said promptly.</p><p>Yeah, that was what I thought. Generally speaking, full recovery took two to three days. "And Kakashi-sensei takes about a week."</p><p>I'd taken the recovery rate we'd witnessed with our two points, guestimated an average chakra capacity for a jounin, and calculated the time it would take to fill. Not even complicated.</p><p>And it was wrong.</p><p>"What's the problem?" Kakashi asked. "Have you found something?" He didn't sound hopeful, didn't sound much of anything, which probably meant he was or was trying not to be.</p><p>"Well," I said. "I've discovered that theoretically you should be fine."</p><p>"Ah," he said dryly. "Well, I'll just hop on home then, shall I?"</p><p>"Two days," Sasuke said, tracing my answer. "It's wrong."</p><p>"I know it's wrong," I said, annoyed. "I just don't know why."</p><p>"Well, the hospital usually tests recovery per day," Sakura said slowly. "Maybe doing it by half hour is just … too short." She reached over to Sasuke's notes. "See? They've already tested this."</p><p>"That doesn't even make sense," I retorted. "Chakra production doesn't vary like that. Sure, it might be <em> less accurate</em> but it's not going to give us an answer that is that far out."</p><p>Sasuke smirked. "Maybe your seal is wrong."</p><p>I glared at him, half-heartedly. Because yeah, that was the most obvious solution to this problem. But… "It's not," I insisted. I gave the tag back to Kakashi-sensei, who applied it with some fascination.</p><p>We watched as it spiralled.</p><p>And the result was <em> lower.</em></p><p>"Well at least it didn't explode," Kakashi-sensei said, peeling it off gingerly. "As far as seal failures go, that's pretty mild."</p><p>"Impossible," I muttered, taking the tag back and going over my seal work. There was nothing wrong with it. I wrote it out again, taking care with my brush flicks so I didn't cross any characters, and applied both tags to myself.</p><p>They gave the same answer.</p><p>I formed a blob of chakra in my hand and let it evaporate into the atmosphere and applied them again. They gave a lower result, equal to about what I'd used.</p><p>"Sasuke," I said, demandingly, and gave them to him.</p><p>He huffed, but used them. And used a jutsu at my urging. We juggled the tags between ourselves, but the numbers steadily climbed, no sudden drops or weird results.</p><p>I stared at them balefully and then passed them to Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>His chakra total had climbed again, back over the last highest mark. Calculating the recovery rate from that and the low result <em> still</em> put him in a normal recovery range.</p><p>"Sensei," I said, voice overly serious. "You're broken."</p><p>"Irregular chakra production?" Sakura suggested, leaning forward eagerly. "Maybe it's not a sharingan issue at all."</p><p>"That develops in early childhood," I pointed out. "And sensei didn't have any problems before the sharingan, right?" I tilted my head back to look at him.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p><em> Then again, he was only thirteen…</em></p><p>"Late onset?" she suggested. "It could have been masked by the sharingan. Or maybe a related disorder… I'll go and see if I can get more specific information!" She fairly bolted out of the room.</p><p>Even Sasuke looked more energised. We'd found <em> something. </em> What that something was and whether it was relevant and what we could do to fix it… those were still questions up in the air.</p><p>While we waited, I grew frustrated with having to reset the measurement tag and ripped it apart, trying to install an auto-reset function so it could continuously monitor instead of taking a single reading. The final result was about twice the size of the original and involved basically setting a circuit breaker that would flip and reset when the reading was made, forcing the seal to restart.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no recording function which meant we'd have to manually watch it and record.</p><p>Sasuke took over that job while I tried to see if I could make the other seal into something more location specific.</p><p>"What would irregularity look like?" Sasuke asked, eyes still focused upon the seal and pencil moving almost absently against the paper.</p><p>"Chakra Irregularity Disorder is characterised by alternating periods of elevated and depressed chakra production," Sakura said promptly, the diagnostic book open in front of her. "Common side effects are mania and lethargy, increased states of activity and mood changes. If chakra production is lower than the basal usage rate, the condition may be life threatening."</p><p>"So," Sasuke said, "changes in gradient. It's not that." He turned his sheet of paper towards us. He'd been recording the data as a graph, rather than straight numbers and it was immediately obvious what he meant.</p><p>"Spikes," I said, thoughtfully.</p><p>It wasn't a slow change. There was a sudden, sharp dip in chakra levels in a couple of places, and then a returning climb at basically the same rate. Overall Kakashi-sensei took much longer to recover, but it wasn't because there was any problem with his chakra generation. But it wasn't a consistent drain, either, it was-</p><p>"Almost like a jutsu," Sasuke said.</p><p>I looked thoughtfully at sensei. "You<em> aren't</em> doing anything, are you?" I asked.</p><p>"And stay in hospital longer?" he deadpanned.</p><p>Yeah, good point.</p><p>"Well," I said, holding up my half completed seal. "I can try isolate where the surge is happening but-"</p><p>"Sharingan," Sasuke filled in, leaning back against the chair. "What else could it be?"</p><p>"Assumptions aren't great," I said. "But I should be able to confirm that with a diagnostic jutsu instead. How frequent are they?"</p><p>Sasuke shrugged one shoulder. "Looks random," he said. "There haven't been many of them so I can't tell if there's a pattern. Sometimes there's nothing for ages. Sometimes there are two really close together."</p><p>We also hadn't really been monitoring for very long, so we didn't have much data for conclusions, either.</p><p>"Okay-" I said, then cut myself off. "Tsunade is coming!"</p><p>Kakashi casually peeled the tag off his arm and dropped it on the floor. Sasuke flipped his graph over and started writing on the back.</p><p>Sakura startled and looked up. "What?"</p><p>The door slid open. Tsunade looked at us, being all casual like, and our work spread out all over the floor and looked immediately unimpressed. "Find anything?" she asked.</p><p>I smiled winningly. "We have a couple of solid ideas," I said, careful not to call them leads. Sure, this might not have been in the files we were given, but that didn't mean Tsunade didn't <em> know</em> . She might have. It wasn't like we had to <em> immediately</em> report it to her. We could look into it first.</p><p>She meandered around the room and gave Kakashi his daily check-up, making notes on his patient chart.</p><p>"Alright," she said. "You can be out of here tomorrow." She tapped her knuckles against his skull, lightly. "<em> No</em> chakra, you hear me? If I see you again before your next appointment, I'm going to be annoyed."</p><p>"Party at sensei's house," I said immediately.</p><p>"Hey, no!" he protested, just as immediately. "Study at your own home."</p><p>"But then you won't show up," I said logically, and nudged Sasuke in the shoulder.</p><p>He nodded. "I'll bring the scrolls," he agreed, completely ignoring sensei.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hospital Arc: Chapter 124</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 124</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. ~ T. S. Eliot</p><p></em> <em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Kakashi-sensei peered down at our three hopeful faces on his doorstep with an expression that was more resignation than surprise.</p><p>"Good morning, sensei," I singsonged, ducking under his arm and into the apartment. It was still the same small, cramped space it had been last time I visited, though now it was piled with textbooks and note paper. "Are you already working?"</p><p>I tried not to sound delighted, but some of it probably slipped through. I'd been afraid he would revert back to the 'it's a waste of time' arguments that I didn't have the patience for. But apparently not. Maybe it was the implication that it might not have been the sharingan or the attempt to do something about it ourselves instead of leaving it in the hands of the hospital.</p><p>Kakashi drew back and flipped idly through one of the books left out on the table. "You know," he said, "a major cause of chakra irregularity is gate malfunction."</p><p>Sakura gasped in horror and covered her mouth.</p><p><em> Oh, jeeze.</em> Actually, this was exactly like leaving a paranoid person with access to WebMD, wasn't it? You plugged in vague symptoms and suddenly you had cancer.</p><p>"The side effects of gate instability are pretty noticeable," I said dryly. "Like suddenly catching on fire." I paused. "Or dressing in green spandex and shouting about youth."</p><p>That was less of a pot-shot at Gai-sensei and more of a reminder that even in that very worst case scenario, we had resources to work with.</p><p>Some of the tension in his shoulders drained away. "That would be pretty noticeable," he agreed.</p><p>"Spontaneous combustion notwithstanding," I went on, "we've got a lot to do."</p><p>I felt like we were making progress, if nowhere near as dramatic as the previous day. We were interrupted about midmorning by an enthusiastic knocking on the door. Or rather, an enthusiastic shuddering of the front wall, presumably from someone knocking.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei hunched down into his seat. "He's been circling since dawn," he lamented, as though we could be reliably expected to know who he was talking about.</p><p>I blinked at him. I had felt the ebb and flow of people around us – unlike my house, Kakashi-sensei's apartment was, well, in an apartment building. And in the village proper. There were people <em> constantly</em> in my range of awareness, living here, or moving in the street, or travelling by rooftop – but I couldn't, with reliable certainty, say I'd sensed Gai-sensei 'circling'.</p><p>The door shuddered again. Kakashi-sensei still didn't move to open it.</p><p>I looked at Sasuke. He gave me a pointed look that amounted to 'not it'. Sakura started to fidget with the awkwardness that came from being around people who were violating polite etiquette.</p><p>I sighed, stood, and went to open the door.</p><p>"Good morning, Gai-sensei," I chirped as brightly as I could. "Kakashi-sensei is really happy you're here! Please come in!"</p><p>Gai-sensei beamed back at me with an amount of teeth that was slightly dazzling, and managed to get past me and inside the house without actually moving me at all. Given the size of the apartment and the fact that there were now five people plus the books covering the floor, that was no mean feat.</p><p><em> Ninja.</em></p><p>"Oh," Kakashi-sensei said, with the worst kind of disaffected surprise. "It's you." He waited a beat. "Why are you here?"</p><p>I flopped back down on the floor and let the Kakashi-and-Gai show continue on without me. Sasuke was ignoring them equally as much, but Sakura was staring vacantly into the air with an expression that faltered somewhere before reaching horrified.</p><p>Did she know Gai-sensei?</p><p>"You know Lee, don't you?" I asked, rhetorically. I was pretty sure she did. "This is his sensei."</p><p>Her expression completed its transformation and seemed to indicate that that information didn't make anything <em> better.</em></p><p>I patted her on the hand. "You get used to it," I assured her. Really though, I would have thought that working at the hospital would have made her see way weirder things. And as far as ninja craziness went, I would take Lee and Gai's harmless exuberance over active creepiness or malice any day.</p><p>"- it pleases me to see that your beloved students are with you!"</p><p>"Ah," Kakashi-sensei agreed vaguely. "They are."</p><p>There was a long and expectant pause that he completely failed to fill with an adequate explanation. Gai-sensei rotated slowly and eyed us, and I <em> felt</em> the heavy weight of his regard demanding an answer.</p><p>I stared reproachfully at sensei. He wasn't going to make us lie to Gai, was he?</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei is teaching us about jutsu creation," Sasuke said, heaving a sigh.</p><p>That wasn't actually a bad excuse. "He is Konoha's foremost expert," I agreed. "And since Tsunade-sama forbid him from training with us we have to put him to work somehow."</p><p>Gai-sensei looked at our clearly medical textbooks and didn't outright call us on it or express any kind of disbelief.</p><p>Sasuke smirked. "Shikako isn't allowed to practice new jutsu without a medic-nin present after the shadow clone debacle," he said.</p><p>"Hey!" I protested, automatically. "That was one time, okay?"</p><p>"What shadow clone debacle?" Sensei asked suspiciously. "When was this?"</p><p>"It was nothing!" I insisted.</p><p>"Oh really?" Sasuke mocked. "Because I recall you insisting on getting Sakura-"</p><p>"That wasn't even-!" I reached out and shoved at his face and we kept bickering and fighting, dragging the conversation leagues away from whatever reason we might have to be in Kakashi's house studying medicine.</p><p>Not exactly what one would call a 'clean save' but it was something.</p><p>Once Gai-sensei had left, I asked, "he doesn't know?"</p><p>"I didn't tell him," Kakashi-sensei said which wasn't quite the same thing. Because everyone knew about the sharingan and chakra drain, and anyone who'd known him for a long time would probably be able to see that it was getting worse. The true scope of it might have been a surprise, though, like it had been to us.</p><p>"Are you going to tell him?" I asked, almost tentative.</p><p>"No."</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>Or… not quite. "You know that means you have to teach us about jutsu creation now, sensei," I said slyly. "To keep up appearances."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Working through the Uchiha records happened slowly. They were haphazardly organised, at best. Sasuke wasn't reluctant to hand them over so much as he was reluctant to consider them at all which was a position I sympathised with but was also not very helpful to us.</p><p>Even just skimming and setting aside took time and, though there were lots of interesting titbits, nothing that jumped out as 'here is the solution to your problem'.</p><p>We'd spent a week running through promising leads and ended up at a dead end that could be uncharitably described as 'right where we started'.</p><p>Given our initial leaps of progress, it was disheartening.</p><p>"There aren't any more records?" I asked Sasuke, trying not to feel desperate. Surely this couldn't have been everything. The Nara clan had so <em> many</em> that it was impossible the Uchiha had so few.</p><p>He shook his head. "Not that I know how to get to," he said, a little helplessly. And that… yeah. Our libraries were protected too. I couldn't get into our classified documents and that wouldn't change if tomorrow there was no more clan to stop me.</p><p>"Okay," I said, and lay starfished out on the floor to stare at the ceiling. "Let's take it from the top."</p><p>Maybe a recap would help us get back on track.</p><p>"We know it's the sharingan," Sasuke said, lifting a shoulder in a shrug that was half apologetic. The hope that it wasn't had fuelled us for a while, but had ultimately been a red herring. A red herring that had served the purpose of offering hope, perhaps, but futile all the same. "It's randomly drawing chakra but doesn't seem to be actually <em> doing</em> anything."</p><p>"But the draw doesn't seem to occur when the sharingan is being actively used," Sakura picked up, nodding to herself. "Either to copy or to cast genjutsu. Well, as far as we can tell."</p><p>Given the constraints of time and chakra and the fact that the spikes were random, we couldn't completely rule it out, but we'd tried.</p><p>"Would it be possible…" Kakashi-sensei asked slowly, "to override the chakra drain?"</p><p>"You mean with a seal?" I asked rhetorically. "I mean. Theoretically. But." I frowned. "It depends on what it's <em> doing</em> with the chakra, really. If it's just going to waste, then there wouldn't be a problem. But if it needs it for something… it's not really a good idea to deprive organs of chakra, you know?"</p><p>"We could run it past Tsunade-sama?" Sakura suggested tentatively. "Even if we don't have a complete solution, she'll be really impressed with what we've managed!"</p><p>There was a disconsolate silence. The idea of leaving it unfinished, of giving up, didn't sit well with me, even if Tsunade-sama could have put the information we'd painstakingly collected together to good use.</p><p>I sighed. "Let's sleep on it," I suggested. "Maybe someone will have a bright idea overnight."</p><p>I didn't.</p><p>I certainly tried. Turning the information over in my head, looking at it from as many different angles as I could. But there were too many blank spots, too many question marks and gaps.</p><p>I was running through my morning exercises with Shikamaru in the backyard when Sasuke's chakra turned up at the house. I kept going but enhanced my hearing just as mom invited him in for breakfast.</p><p>"No, I just wanted to talk to Shikako," he said, as though I wouldn't have met him in another half hour anyway.</p><p>He didn't seem agitated or impatient, though, so I finished up without hurrying. Being busy wasn't a good excuse to skimp on training – that was definitely something I'd regret.</p><p>"Morning," I greeted, raising an eyebrow in silent question.</p><p>Sasuke shook his head, hands in his pockets. "Had an idea," he said, vaguely. "Something I wanted to show you."</p><p>I grabbed food quickly and followed him, to his amusement.</p><p>"You could have eaten breakfast," he said, looking at me sideways. He led us not towards town but towards the old Uchiha district. "We're not in a hurry."</p><p>"Curiosity waits for no man," I declared. "Or meal. So, what have you got?"</p><p>He was silent, but I followed him anyway as we skirted past the training fields and towards an old shrine.</p><p>"You asked if there was any other information," he said as we stood inside it.</p><p>It was… a little creepy, if I was honest. Old and abandoned, but the faint lingering of old chakra brushed my senses like household spirits still protecting it – repeated rituals and grave seriousness marking them onto the world.</p><p>This had been an important place, back when the clan had been still alive.</p><p>"Here?" I asked.</p><p>Sasuke nodded, jerkily and swallowed. But he moved with deliberation, moving one of the tatami mats aside and revealing an empty space below. "Down here," he said softly and dropped.</p><p>I followed him.</p><p>It was dark below, but we lit it up with chakra. It was a rough space, bare and stone, dominated by a single large wall with inscriptions I couldn't read.</p><p>"It's sharingan code," Sasuke whispered, eyes flickering red. "It's about… about the secret of the sharingan."</p><p>The mangekyo.</p><p>"Okay," I said gently, just as quiet. Something about the space made me want to keep hushed, keep quiet.</p><p>He seemed to take that as prompting to go on. "The code gets more complicated at each layer," he said. "You have to evolve your sharingan to be able to read it. But it says… <em> the eye that opens in battle sees all</em> ," he recited. "<em> The eye that opens in experience copies all. The eye that opens in knowledge reflects all.</em> "</p><p>"The three tomoe," I said.</p><p>"The next-" he swallowed. "The next line says <em> the eye that opens in grief knows the faces of the gods.</em> "</p><p>And I was expecting it – not the words, exactly, but I knew what was coming – and it still hit me like a freight train to the chest. It shouldn't have. I already knew this. <em> I already knew this.</em></p><p>"Tsukiyomi," I whispered, feeling lightheaded. It was just this shrine that had me feeling like this, dislocated and out of place. "Itachi had this."</p><p>I could hear him swallow. It seemed to echo in the darkness around us. "He killed Shisui," he said, voice cracking. "They were best friends. And he told me-"</p><p>He cut himself off, breathing harsh and raw. I reached out, blindly, and gripped his arm, unsure of which of us I was trying to support.</p><p>"The Mangekyo Sharingan. This is the foundation of the great Uchiha clan," he said, bitterly, not continuing that thought. What he'd said was enough.</p><p>I breathed, steadily, and stared at that stone tablet. "In grief," I repeated.</p><p>Was it really so simple?</p><p>Had I really overlooked this?</p><p>Fact. Kakashi-sensei didn't have the mangekyo now. Fact. In that show, a lifetime ago, he'd had it after Naruto returned.</p><p>Somewhere between those two points-</p><p><em> He told me-</em></p><p>Had Sasuke said something, as he left, as he fought Naruto in the Valley of the End, about his brother and his clan? Had they simply investigated, afterwards, and found this anyway? Had there been a different mission, different actions, that had activated it once and for all?</p><p>Sasuke shifted. "What?"</p><p>"I think Kakashi-sensei needs to see this," I said slowly, trying to plan out a course of action.</p><p>"You think-" he started. "Huh. That could be…"</p><p>"It could be," I agreed.</p><p>Sasuke snorted, managing to chase off the hovering darkness with sheer attitude alone. "I guess you want to drag Sakura along too," he said.</p><p>"It's your call," I said, "I guess it depends on whether you think we need a medical ninja."</p><p>"To stare at a wall?" He replied dryly. "For us? Probably."</p><p>We scrambled out of the shrine, resetting the tatami mat floor and made our way to Kakashi-sensei's house. Sakura was already there, and they both looked suspiciously at us when we arrived.</p><p>"You're late," Sakura said.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei burst into giggles.</p><p>"Insert witty excuse here," I said swiftly and clapped my hands together. "Come on, on your feet people. We're going on a field trip."</p><p>"Field trip?" Sakura asked, frowning with worry. "Where? What are we doing?"</p><p>"Just taking a look at some rocks," I said breezily. "No medical jutsu involved. Totally within the scope of our assignment."</p><p>"Looking at rocks," Kakashi said. "My favourite activity."</p><p>They both seemed more interested the closer we got to the Uchiha compound though for very different reasons. Sasuke seemed to get more and more discomforted, which was understandable. I felt a little guilty, thinking that I should probably have been a bit more supportive of the whole 'revealing horrible secrets of my clan' instead of just leaping ahead to drag more people into it.</p><p>I caught his eye when we got to the door but he just shrugged. "Let's get on with it."</p><p>The space below the shrine was no more inviting the second time around. I lit up LED tags to brighten it but that only seemed to make it harsher.</p><p>"So, uh," I said, gesturing at the inscribed wall. "The Sharingan apparently has another level of ability, above the three tomoe form. It's what Itachi used…" I made a little back and forth gesture between myself and Kakashi-sensei. "These are apparently the… instructions? I guess."</p><p>"Do you think his sharingan is attempting to progress to that level?" Sakura asked, eagerly following the same train of thought. "We did note that the greatest use of chakra in Sasuke-kun's sharingan was when it was activating, not when it was in normal use. Oh! And Kakashi-san's sharingan didn't draw extra chakra while it was in use."</p><p>"I don't see why not," I said.</p><p>"The activation criteria is…" Sasuke said, eyes looking around searchingly, "specific. But it's possible that between the transplant and … life experiences there might be enough to kickstart it."</p><p>"But not complete it," Kakashi-sensei finished, looking at the wall like it might turn into a bunch of snakes and try to bite him.</p><p>"Or, well," I said. "You might be stopping it? Or not allowing it to complete itself? If it's like a <em> technique</em> that needs to be activated, the fact that you don't know that it's there might be enough to inhibit it."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei tilted his headband up.</p><p>"Um," Sakura said nervously. "Maybe we should get Tsunade-sama first?" she squeaked.</p><p>"The eye that opens in battle sees all," Kakashi-sensei read. His eye started to spin, around and around. "The eye that opens in experience copies all. The eye that opens-"</p><p>He blinked and staggered, slightly.</p><p>"Sensei?" I asked, alarmed, reaching out for him. His chakra dipped and wavered, alarmingly.</p><p>"His chakra level is falling," Sakura said, hands glowing green. "You have to stop."</p><p>"No, keep going," I disagreed. "The sharingan is drawing it. It's activating!"</p><p>"It's too much!" She said shrilly.</p><p>"-in knowledge reflects all," Sensei went on, barely a hitch in his voice. "The eye that opens in <em> grief</em> -"</p><p>I pulled my chakra, funnelled it through a transfusion jutsu and shoved it into him. His system almost ate it, hungry and empty.</p><p>"Grief," he croaked.</p><p>The black tomoe of his eye was twisting, shrinking and reforming into an angular three pointed shuriken.</p><p>"-knows the faces of the gods!"</p><p>"Stop!" Sakura said shrilly.</p><p>"The eye-" Kakashi-sensei choked. His sharingan spun and spun and spun.</p><p>The air in front of us started to twist, to distort, to warp, the center point heavier and blacker than the air around it, dragging us towards it with a gravitational pull.</p><p>I anchored myself to the ground but the pull was strong, stronger than any magnetism seal I'd managed to create. I slipped over the ground, chunks of it lifting up with me and flying into the maw to vanish entirely.</p><p>Then Sasuke was grabbing us and hurling us away from it, slamming Kakashi-sensei's headband down over his eye. The chakra flow cut off abruptly.</p><p>"Ow," I said, having bounced off the far wall and landed on the floor. "Sensei?"</p><p>Sakura was hovering over him fretfully but he was sitting up, propped against the wall, blinking heavily. He was okay; he was okay.</p><p>Sasuke looked between him and the wall. "Did you just create a black hole in my basement?" he asked with blank incredulity.</p><p>Sakura giggled hysterically.</p><p>I rolled to my feet, a little stiffly. "Well. I guess you don't get funky genjutsu coma powers with yours," I said, as lightly as I could.</p><p>"Pity," Kakashi-sensei rasped.</p><p>"I hate you and all your ideas," Sasuke said blithely to me and ran a shaking hand through his hair. "All of them. Forever."</p><p>"I honestly didn't think it was going to go like that?" I said meekly.</p><p>"Tsunade-sama is going to kill us," Sakura added brightly. She was shaking too.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei huffed. "Mah, mah, weren't you just saying she would be really impressed with us?"</p><p>"Before we nearly <em> killed you</em> ," she said. "Nearly killed <em> us!</em> "</p><p>"And yet no one is dead," I said brightly. "I'd call that a win for Team Miracle!" I pumped a fist in the air, hopefully.</p><p>No one looked particularly impressed.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei rolled his neck so he was staring at the tablet again. "What was," he asked, "the last line about?"</p><p>"Last line?" Sasuke echoed, frowning.</p><p>"<em> The eye taken from thy brother is eternal</em> ," Kakashi-sensei recited.</p><p>And Sasuke went white.</p><p><hr /></p><p>AN: So this arc was drafted ages and ages ago, to answer the very simple question of 'how did Kakashi get Mangekyo' which he never uses in Naruto but uses pretty early on in Shippuden. This was a pretty big topic of consideration, back in the day. *insert fandom grandma voice* This even fits reasonably well with the Rin reveal that happened after, though given Kakashi's life there's plenty of <em> grief</em> going around either way.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hospital Arc: Chapter 125</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 125</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. ~ Charles R. Swindoll</p><p></em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Sasuke bolted.</p><p>I pressed a hand hurriedly to Sakura's shoulder. "You can take care of sensei, right?" I asked, barely waiting for her affirmative before I was after him.</p><p>As they said, one crisis at a time. Kakashi-sensei's was over, so now it was time for Sasuke's.</p><p>That might not have been the spirit of the proverb but it sure felt like the letter of it.</p><p>I locked onto Sasuke's chakra, forgoing trying to catch up with him to just follow. He wasn't trying to hide, burning up like a streak of lightning homing in on a target.</p><p>The target was a clearing far on the other side of the Uchiha compound. It had clearly been used for training at some point in the past, with target boards set up on the trees around it, enough of them at varying angles that it would have been a challenge to get them all.</p><p>There had also been a very large rock in the middle of the clearing.</p><p>I said had, because Sasuke <em> pulverised</em> it with a chidori, slamming into it with a fist full of screaming lightning and sending shards of stone exploding into the air. The rock had been a clear fixture, twice our height and nearly square, but it couldn't contend with Sasuke's sheer fury.</p><p>I hung back and watched as he stopped, shoulders shaking. The line of his back was so tense, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. Everything about him screamed 'don't touch'.</p><p>The air started to settle, dust swirling and chunks of battered rock raining back to the earth.</p><p>He spun into action again, eyes so red and violent and a chidori blossoming in his hands. He slammed it into what was left of the rock, into the ground where it had been, and dragged it through the clearing, gorging a massive wound in the earth.</p><p>I waited.</p><p>Sasuke stopped again. He was still shaking, but this time I could hear his breathing, huge and heavy gasps, like he couldn't get enough of it.</p><p>Then… nothing.</p><p>"Feel better?" I asked, voice as level and neutral as I could make it. No judgement.</p><p>Information like that and I would have probably wanted to wreck stuff too.</p><p>He turned to me and the red faded out of his eyes. He didn't seem surprised that I was there, but I had been deliberately not-stealthy. He'd probably anticipated it, at any rate.</p><p>"No," he said and ran a still shaking hand though his hair. "Do you think this would make me <em> feel better?</em> "</p><p>I shrugged. "Seemed like it might have been why you were doing it," I said and kicked over a chunk of rock to sit on, deliberate casual ease in very action. I was in no hurry.</p><p>He stalked over to one of the target boards, one that still had a single kunai in it, and yanked the kunai out, tossing it into the forest with a careless underhand throw. Then he deliberately took the target down and broke it over his knee, discarding the pieces to the side.</p><p>I waited.</p><p>"We trained here," he said, suddenly, voice like a whip crack, startling in its volume. He pressed his palm flat against the tree, where the target had been.</p><p>I guessed that explained the methodical destruction, after all. Not wild rage, then. Not lashing out as a coping mechanism. A thing, a representation that needed to be decimated.</p><p>"We trained here," he repeated. "I used to <em> ask</em> -"</p><p>His voice cut off. And he seemed to find a last reserve of energy, pulling his hand back and slamming a fist into the tree instead. It wasn't enhanced, did nothing to the tree except split his knuckles open on the bark.</p><p><em> Right.</em> I stood and moved closer, taking his hand and using a healing jutsu to stop the bleeding.</p><p>"That's a hell of a thing to learn," I said, evenly.</p><p>He snorted. "I wondered- you know, I <em> wondered</em> -" he cut himself off, clearing his throat. "How can it be worse than anything I imagined?" He gave a sound that might have qualified as a laugh, if it wasn't so helpless.</p><p>"You thought he left you alive because he loved you," I said, because the truth carved it out of me. It was a line of attack I was already committed to, too far in to pull back, to turn aside.</p><p>(<em> He did, he did Sasuke. He loved you more than anyone, more than his family, more than his village. And that's why you're alive.)</em></p><p>Sasuke flinched and pulled away. "So <em> stupid</em> ," he hissed, eyes falling shut. "I thought. That maybe he just… couldn't." It seemed torn out of him, as though he was being gutted by this conversation.</p><p>And this was it, wasn't it? This was the time. I knew the truth. Sasuke needed to know it. Danzo was still lurking around the edges and while knowing the truth might put him in danger, not knowing it might also.</p><p><em> Your brother loves you</em> , I pictured saying. <em> You aren't wrong. He couldn't. There are things rotten in Konoha and you need to know- </em></p><p>But I remembered those eyes. The shape of them so similar to Sasuke. The eyelashes that were long and delicate. The red, red inhumanness of them, spiralling and spinning. The feel of the cold, dry hand around my neck and the press of stone against my back.</p><p>The feeling of oil sliding slickly past my eyes, burning into my brain-</p><p>"But he came back," Sasuke said. "He came <em> back, </em> like once wasn't enough and he-" he cut himself off, spinning on his heel and facing me, expression slamming closed. "I shouldn't be talking about this with you."</p><p>(<em> Your brother loved you, Sasuke.)</em></p><p>"Who else are you going to talk about it with?" I asked, logically, perfectly calm. "You know I'm always willing to listen."</p><p>I didn't have evidence, that was the thing. The Uchiha records proved nothing, even if I could show them to him without arousing suspicion. The closest I had was Sai and he couldn't say anything about Danzo – and that only proved that Danzo was acting at all. Sai knew nothing about the Uchiha situation. Knew nothing about Itachi.</p><p>Even if I said, even if I tried to console him right now, tried to soften the blow of this information, tried to spare his feelings… would I only stir it up further? Would I only introduce more pain and confusion?</p><p>"Yeah, I know," Sasuke said. "You want him dead too."</p><p>My eyes slid away, my own words – of a sort – parroted back to me. I couldn't say they were wrong.</p><p>"I-" I stammered, that cold logic deserting me for a second and I <em> felt</em> -</p><p>it was on the tip of my tongue, it was -</p><p>"-I want you to be okay," I said, weighing the words like they were something as precious as gold. "And I know that it's not really okay, and it won't be okay. Not now, maybe not ever. And this is only a little part of it. And… there's probably nothing I can really say about it that will make it better. Except…" I swallowed, mouth dry and tacky. "It's hard to live a whole life as a lie. Maybe you didn't see everything that was going on, but that doesn't mean what you did see was <em> wrong.</em> "</p><p><em> Weak. Not enough.</em></p><p>I knew. Sasuke's focus was like a blade, one he'd been honing for years already. This was another spark for the forging, another stone to grind it against, another step down the path that led him to kill his brother.</p><p>I should say something to drag him back, to turn his focus aside, to cast doubt on it, so that if – when – it happened… there was a chance for him not to break his own heart.</p><p>"It doesn't matter," he said heavily, mouth twisting. "It's not okay but it doesn't change anything. At least now I know."</p><p>My heart was hammering like I was in the middle of a fight.</p><p>"Sure," I said, the word emerging like a bubble through molasses.</p><p>"We should go back," he said, reaching out and fingertips barely brushing my elbow, like he was escorting me.</p><p>I gave him a weak smile. "You know, this probably makes me a bad friend, but I'm absolutely okay with leaving Sakura to explain everything to the Hokage."</p><p>He snorted. "Ah yes, I see what your friendship is worth." He tugged me onwards, clearly meaning to leave the destruction behind us.</p><p><em> You don't know the half of it,</em> I thought, eyeing him sideways.</p><p>"I guess there's a lot of damage control to do," I agreed.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Tsunade wasn't actually at the hospital when we got there. I mean, she was probably busy doing important Hokage type stuff, and this wasn't actually an immediately life threatening situation.</p><p>A ninja struck with chakra exhaustion after a 'training accident' wasn't even unusual. The fact that it was Kakashi-sensei only enhanced the amount of 'what, again?' attitude.</p><p>"What are we going to say?" Sakura asked, biting her lip. "We're going to have to report this."</p><p>I shrugged. "The truth? Just leave out the shrine and what the tablet actually said and it should be close enough."</p><p>Those absolutely fell under 'clan secrets' and even if Sasuke had been willing to share them with his team it probably wasn't a good idea for that information to get out. Scratch that, it <em> definitely</em> wasn't a good idea to let it get out.</p><p>"On the bright side," Sasuke said dryly, crossing his arms. "The hospital can confirm whether or not it fixed the problem."</p><p>They'd taken a chakra measure when he came in and it would only take another one to confirm whether his chakra recovery rate was back into normal levels or not. If it was; success.</p><p>"Think we can sell Tsunade on that?" I asked, idly kicking my feet. "It's just for a follow up?"</p><p>No one answered. Yeah, I didn't think so either.</p><p>Eventually we got bored of just <em> waiting</em> and I was dispatched to sensei's place to retrieve all our notes. We organised them, putting together a report on what we'd found, mostly in the hopes of being able to present it to Tsunade and escaping.</p><p>That was obviously not how it worked.</p><p>When she did show up – and of course she did, personally – she took the report and tucked it under her arm before glaring at us, unimpressed.</p><p>"I distinctly remember," she drawled. "Saying 'no one try anything without me'."</p><p>"Well," Kakashi-sensei said. "Technically there was no <em> medical jutsu</em> involved."</p><p>The unimpressed look only got worse. "Don't give me technicalities, brat. What happened?"</p><p>"Well," I said. "You know that miracle you ordered?" I used both palms to gesture to Kakashi-sensei and smiled winningly at her.</p><p>Something unreadable passed through her eyes. She set the file down and moved towards Kakashi, performing a diagnostic jutsu. "Explain."</p><p>"Uh." I glanced at Sasuke. "So. It turns out that three tomoe isn't the highest level of sharingan development. I guess it was like a secret technique? It must have been pretty rare… uh. Sensei obviously didn't know about it, so he couldn't use it, but it must have kept getting triggered to activate and would draw in a huge amount of chakra. Micro-activations, maybe?" I pursed my lips thoughtfully.</p><p>"So, you tried to activate it," Tsunade said flatly, not even a question.</p><p>"Not quite," I hedged, even though she was more right than wrong. "The Uchiha had an… artefact that required the advanced sharingan to read. We thought it might have instructions on it, so we showed it to sensei to see if he could decipher it. But I guess it… gave him something to focus on?"</p><p>I looked to sensei and shrugged.</p><p>He nodded. "I could read it," he acknowledged. "And I could feel the difference." He paused for a long moment. I was about to take up with story again when he smiled, eye crinkling, and said, "then I tried to activate it."</p><p>I coughed, and covered my mouth, trying desperately not to laugh. Or smile.</p><p>Tsunade huffed in pure exasperation. Sakura looked mortified.</p><p>"It worked," Sasuke chimed in, face held so still that I could tell he was trying not to laugh too. "But he also managed to activate some other technique at the same time. Which is where the chakra exhaustion came from."</p><p>She nodded. "And do you think that's a risk in the future?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei shrugged. "I have no idea," he said, honestly. "But that's what training is for."</p><p>I was sure he'd learn how. And if not, well, we knew the problem now. We could devise a solution for it.</p><p>"Alright," Tsunade said, finally. "I'm going to monitor this and see if it really is resolved. I'm also going to go over this," she held up our report, "<em> in detail.</em> "</p><p>Sakura looked incredibly worried, folding her hands tightly in her lap.</p><p>"But firstly," Tsunade added, and her disapproving façade broke enough to smile. "Good job, kids."</p><p>We all relaxed.</p><p>She wasn't kidding about going through our report thoroughly, though.</p><p>And she picked up on exactly the thing that would get me most into trouble.</p><p>"And where, exactly," she asked, tapping the page with her fingernail. "Did these readings come from?"</p><p>"Well," I said, slowly. "I have a <em> combat seal</em> that I, in my capacity as a field shinobi, gifted to Kakashi-sensei <em> for the purpose of field work</em> that he's been kindly demonstrating for me."</p><p>I hadn't actually come up with a field work reason for said seal yet. Maybe a trigger threshold to set off traps?</p><p>"And what does this seal do?" Tsunade asked dryly.</p><p>"Measures chakra capacity," I answered shamelessly.</p><p>"Get it approved," Tsunade ordered, flicking me in the forehead. It stung, but only in the way being hit in the forehead with a fingernail stung – there was no chakra behind it, only friendly admonition.</p><p>"Yes, Tsunade-sama," I said, because asking for forgiveness instead of permission worked best when you accepted the clauses of forgiveness. I wasn't an idiot.</p><p>But it was a pain. I didn't even have Tenten to foist it all off onto-</p><p>"Hey Sakura," I said, innocently. "Do you want to collaborate on this? It'll be a learning experience for you."</p><p><hr /></p><p>It was probably an even better idea to enlist Sakura's help than I'd initially thought, because the problem with diving into full research mode on Kakashi-sensei's behalf was that it meant I hadn't had a chance to catch up on any of the stuff that had been lingering while I was away at the Fire Temple.</p><p>I started with the Intel Division, which was mostly just procrastination on my part. The most exciting thing there was a note from Aoba with a case file number and the words 'negotiations restarted'.</p><p>That had to mean they'd rescued the kids, <em> surely</em> . I didn't expect that I would ever be told, given that it had been handed over to Anbu, but if the negotiations were back on track then that had to mean that the kids had been returned home.</p><p>I destroyed the message, carefully, and made a mental note to drop by the Inuzuka compound at some point and let Kiba know, in case no one else had.</p><p>After that I had to face the music.</p><p>It… wasn't as bad as I had been preparing myself for.</p><p>Oh, there were plenty of questions about the Shadow Hand. But by this point they'd been working on it for nearly as long as I had taken to design it and I had to point that out to them. Most of the focus now was on making it usable for other people – changing the size and shape from a thirteen-year-old to an adult, for example, or from an arm to a leg.</p><p>Their initial attempts at modifying the seal had not gone particularly well and I promised to look over them and see why not. I had thought that change would be relatively easy, because I had described the properties and dimensions as clearly as I could but… seals.</p><p>"Shikaku-sama also said you were going to be teaching fuuinjutsu to a student," Kofuku-oba said, reminding me of yet another thing I owed the clan.</p><p>"Yes," I said, cautiously, shifting the massive pile of notes to rest on my hip. "I'm drafting a syllabus at the moment. And I'm probably going to need some worksheets printed once I finalise the material."</p><p>I had wanted Tenten's assistance – and not <em> just</em> to foist the storage scroll portion of it off onto her – because I wanted it to be as clear and easy to follow as possible and sometimes what I thought was simple didn't seem that way to other people. But she was out on a mission and Shikamaru didn't know when she would be returning.</p><p>"That's easy enough to organise," she said, which was very agreeable for an interaction between us. "Have you chosen a student? There are several volunteers within the department."</p><p>"I'll get back to you on that," I hedged, physically edging towards the door. Dad had given me the register and told me to pick, but how was I supposed to know who would be good at it?</p><p>I wasn't entirely sure my solution was how I was <em> supposed</em> to solve that dilemma, but it was also the lowest effort solution on my part. So, obviously, it was what I was going for.</p><p>Kofuku-oba seemed disappointed, but didn't call after me as I left, so that was a victory.</p><p>Along with the Shadow Hand project to review I also had my papers from the Fire Temple to submit, and the other seals to chase and finalise for testing. Shikamaru had done a lot of it already, and Tenten had clearly still been working with the clan because she'd left a bullet-pointed checklist on my desk for follow-up.</p><p>"Hey, kid," Takatori said, before I'd even managed to sit down. "Nice to have you back. Had a vacation after your vacation, huh?"</p><p>I snorted. "Got called to consult on a medical thing," I said vaguely, trying to find the papers that would get Sakura the contract to work on the seal with me. "Got another medical seal to submit."</p><p>"Well I guess you can be forgiven then," he said seriously. "Though I'm not sure QA will agree with me."</p><p>"There's no rush on this one," I offered. "And Tsunade <em> kind of</em> approves of it?"</p><p>"I'm not sure if I want to know that story or really don't," he said.</p><p>I settled in, motivated to knock as much of it out of the way as I could. I didn't get nearly enough of it done, but there was also no rush, so I made sure to be home well in time for dinner.</p><p>Afterwards, I settled in on the living room floor to work on my Fuuinjutsu 101 preparation.</p><p>"Mom," I asked, thoughtfully. "You don't know anything about sealing, right?"</p><p>"Sorry, dear," she answered. "I would have helped you already if I did."</p><p>"No, no," I reassured. "That's perfect. I need to know if you understand this without having any kind of background."</p><p>What that led to was a lot of revision, expanding and adding more and more depth and clarifications. My opening statement turned from effectively 'sealing, let's go' to a whole page of 'what <em> is</em> sealing, even'.</p><p>I definitely made sure to include the revelation Jiraiya had given me, though. No point in passing on my own mistakes and misunderstandings. I'd make that clear, early on.</p><p>There were definitely points where her eyes started to glaze over and while I was trying to keep it as straightforward as possible, depth and simplicity weren't synonyms.</p><p>The next day I kicked off with going and doing some <em> actual</em> training, meeting Sasuke at our team training fields and doing our best to kick the shit out of each other in true Team 7 style.</p><p>"You've been slacking," he teased, fending me off with what was starting to become an insulting amount of ease.</p><p>"I've been studying," I corrected. "There's a difference."</p><p>"Not on the battlefield."</p><p>Just for that, I let him commit to an attack before slapping a barrier seal tag up on the air and letting him crash face first into it and bounce off.</p><p>He corrected with grace, springing across the grass and eyeing the glowing transparent wall of chakra with consideration.</p><p>"Single tag barrier seal," I supplied. "Still has some problems to work out, but-" I wiggled my fingers at him. "-studying."</p><p>"Hmm," he said, before throwing a brace of shuriken that curved in an arc around the edges of the wall.</p><p>I batted them away with a kunai and it was back on.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Totally irrelevant factoid: The original Kunoichi group was going to be named 'the Hokage's Angels' and I'm really sad I never had a chance for them to chorus 'good morning, Hokage-sama' to Tsunade and inspire it. Maybe they can be an elite team, later on.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 126</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. ~ </em> <em> George R.R. Martin</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"So, is anyone coming?" Tenten asked, lifting herself up to sit on the table that dominated the meeting room I'd booked. Her legs swung off the edge, aimlessly. She'd agreed to help me with teaching in exchange for sitting in on the rest of the lessons, which was a total no-brainer.</p><p>I shuffled my notes, trying not to let the creeping anxiety get to me. "I thought they would?" I said uncertainly. "I'm sure I said the right place and time."</p><p>I hadn't exactly gone around telling <em> everyone</em> but … I'd told dad and a handful of people at RnD and they'd all assured me they'd pass the message on to anyone who was interested. And given how gung-ho dad and Kofuku had been, I'd thought someone would have been strong-armed into it at least.</p><p>"On the bright side," I added, trying to sound unconcerned. "If they don't that means we don't have to do it."</p><p>On second thought, I quite liked that. I could say <em> oh I really tried, it was a pity no one showed up</em> and then not actually have to do any work. Dad got to know I'd tried, I didn't actually have to teach anyone, everyone won. Well. No. Mostly I won.</p><p>I was okay with that.</p><p>Although that did put us back into square one on the 'have someone else around who knows what's going on' front.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>There was a knock on the door. Tenten slipped off the desk and straightened, professionally, but it was just dad so… whatever.</p><p>"No one is here," I said, waving at the room to show him the lack of students.</p><p>He nodded and patted me on the head. "I booked a different room for you," he said. "Are these all your notes?"</p><p>"What's wrong with this one?" I protested. "I already got the whiteboard set up!" It was only a small one on a stand, but totally preferable to chalk on a blackboard and it didn't require me to wall climb just to reach the top.</p><p>He gave the whiteboard an experimental push, but the wheels squeaked and didn't want to move in the same direction, so he simply picked the whole thing up instead, carrying it out of the room.</p><p>"Dad!" I said, exasperated, grabbing my notes and tagging along after him. "Where are we going?"</p><p>It wasn't another room within the research block, that was for sure. I wasn't actually sure where we were going until I got outside and could <em> feel</em> the chakra emanating from the clan meeting house – technically also a shrine, but mostly in the sense that it was where clan events were held, ceremonies and things that needed space for all of us.</p><p>"Did you invite the whole clan?" I asked, incredulous, stopping in my tracks.</p><p>Dad kept moving, not even looking back over his shoulder at me. "You did say to invite anyone who was interested," he said, mildly. "A larger group gives you greater chance of finding someone with the skills you need, doesn't it?"</p><p>I huffed. He wasn't wrong. He probably hadn't actually <em> required</em> anyone to attend, though there might have been some heavy suggesting – probably on the basis that if no one turned up I was going to just blow this whole thing right off.</p><p>Which was exactly what I had been contemplating. Checkmate.</p><p>Inside it was clear to see that it wasn't the <em> entire</em> clan. Sembei-obaasan wasn't here, for one. Pretty much everyone else over the age of twelve was, though. Or ten. I was pretty sure I saw a few Academy students in the crowd.</p><p>Dad set down the whiteboard at the front of the room, then turned me by the shoulders so I was facing him. He took a thin strip of black fabric out of his pocket and secured it snugly around my throat, so that the microphone on it was unobscured. <em> That</em> he plugged into what was effectively a Walkman.</p><p>"Just hit record when you're ready to start," he advised.</p><p>I didn't even want to know what kind of strings he had pulled for this or why he'd decided it was necessary.</p><p>Critically, I eyed the mass of people grouped around the room, Tenten hovering just over my shoulder. I tried not to wilt at the combined weight of so many eyes resting on me.</p><p>"Okay," I said, relieved when my voice came out low and steady. "Everyone who is here to actually learn, front and centre. Everyone who is just here to be nosy… whatever." I couldn't get rid of them, so they'd just have to hang around the edges. The two academy students crept forward at the implicit invitation, though I really doubted that they were going to get much out of this.</p><p>I mean, they might. Even if I wasn't exactly a typical example, Tenten had clearly mastered at least one branch of sealing well enough to make her own storage seal.</p><p>I pressed 'record'.</p><p>"Welcome to Fuuinjutsu 101," I began and even the quiet murmurs of conversation died away. I tried to focus my eyes on the crowd and eventually settled them on mum and Shikamaru, who totally fell into the category 'just here to be nosy'. "People have been expressing an interest in learning about sealing, so this course is an attempt to impart as much theoretical knowledge to as many people as quickly as possible. We've got a lot to cover, so I'm going to try and get through it all as fast as I can. Class will be same-time-same-place every night for approximately an hour. It'll take us <em> about</em> four weeks to cover everything I have planned, assuming we have no setbacks. If I'm called out on a mission, Tenten will take over."</p><p>Tenten waved from beside me, before tucking her hands behind her back. This had to be <em> way</em> more awkward for her, standing here without even having anything to say.</p><p>"If Tenten isn't available," I continued. "Class will be suspended until one of us returns. If <em> you</em> can't attend, then notes will be available and Nara-sama has <em> thoughtfully</em> decided to tape them so there will also be an audio recording."</p><p>I hoped that was what he intended it for, anyway.</p><p>"Wait," someone called out, disrupting me. "You mean there's no test?"</p><p>"Please don't interrupt me," I said, as calmly as I could manage. "We're on a tight schedule. If you have questions, I'll answer them at the end. But no, the test is 'do I understand this' and it happens inside your head every minute. I can't decide for you if you understand what I'm teaching, I can only provide the information to you. I know that it's quite difficult to find information on sealing, so I've distilled as much of my own studies as possible." I paused. "If I'm honest, I expect there will only be two or three of you left by the time the course concludes."</p><p>I saw more than a few stubborn looks flash at that proclamation. Oops. That wasn't meant to be a challenge. Well. Whatever worked.</p><p>"Okay. So, we're going to start with an overview – what is sealing, what do we use it for and how does it work. From there we're going to briefly detour to discuss chakra and its fundamental properties because it's important to have a thorough understanding of what we're manipulating. Then we're going to look at the twelve most popular methods of sealing- "</p><p>I was cut off <em> again.</em> I couldn't even see who said it, this time, just the general location it came from. "Aren't you going to teach us how to <em> make</em> seals?"</p><p>I didn't appreciate that demanding tone.</p><p>"Good luck trying to make one without this," I said dryly. "There's a reason I'm starting with this. But actually, in answer to your question… no." For one, I didn't want to be responsible for this many people fucking around with seals, but I wasn't going to say that. "This is purely theoretical. If there's enough interest after the theory class is over, we'll put together a study group to collaborate. No one can stop you from attempting to experiment on your own but I feel it's important to inform you that using unconfirmed seals on people outside of combat situations is liable to get you into trouble. Check RnD for more information before you do."</p><p>Well, that should cover my ass in event of problems.</p><p>"And again, <em> please </em> don't interrupt me<em> .</em> " I took a deep breath. "Where was I?"</p><p>By the time the hour was up, I was strangely exhausted. My throat was incredibly dry and I was glad I'd had my water canteen packed into hammerspace. The question and answer session went on longer than I'd really liked, with some good questions, some bad.</p><p>"I'm not actually a trained medical ninja," I said, answering one about why I wasn't covering them. "However, given how many we do have in the clan, I'm sure there's someone that has a greater understanding of how they work."</p><p>"Why barrier, storage and exploding seals?" Someone else wanted to know. I was pretty sure it was one of the research ladies. Ryosen? "Will you talk about your chakra measurement seals?"</p><p>"In passing," I said. "There are a <em> lot</em> of seals, even basic ones like light or sound creating ones, that I'll just be skimming over. If I wanted to do them in more detail, the course would just get longer and longer and we're all very busy people who can't afford that. I picked those three because they're basic building blocks for a ninja's arsenal, while also exemplifying very different types of seals. They're also very popular, so it's easy to find examples of them in different sealing methods to compare and contrast."</p><p>The third time I covered the same point, worded in a slightly different way, I decided we were done and wrapped it all up.</p><p>"Same time tomorrow!" I said, carefully turning off the recording device and unhooking it from my neck.</p><p>I thought I'd see maybe <em> half</em> of them, at a very optimistic guess. Heck, maybe the numbers would drop enough that I could go back to using the RnD meeting room.</p><p>I handed the recording off to dad.</p><p>"Good job," he said, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. "That was well done."</p><p>The praise was nice but I still grumbled at him. "You didn't have to invite <em> so many </em> of them."</p><p>He tugged on a strand of my hair. "I didn't think you were just going to launch right into it," he said, voice terribly dry. "I thought you had some very clever method of testing to see who would be good at it or not."</p><p>I made a face. "It's called 'let them try and see if they fail'."</p><p>He huffed. "I am surprised you're willing to teach them all," he admitted. "Aren't you worried about information security?"</p><p>"Ah," I acknowledged. Ninja were pretty cagey about their techniques. "But it's a clan technique now. Information security is <em> your </em> problem."</p><p>I rose up on my tippy toes to kiss his cheek, then sauntered on past him.</p><p>Behind me, I heard Kofuku-oba's very dry voice. "Well, I'm glad it's not just <em> me</em> that has problems with her."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The sealing lessons seemed to go reasonably smoothly. True to my predictions, the class size dropped pretty dramatically when it turned out that it really was just all theory. There were more left than I'd thought – mostly the researchers, and I guessed that 'huge amounts of information' wasn't as off putting to them.</p><p>Kofuku-oba talked about getting the audio transcripts and my notes written up into a reference textbook, which I agreed to on the basis that less people would ask me questions if they had a way to go and look it up instead. My original sealing styles notebook got included into the bargain, because it really was more detailed than I was going into in the lectures.</p><p>Shortly afterwards Shikamaru was dispatched with Team 10 on a C-rank mission to escort a bunch of merchants. It was probably total overkill to send a team of Chunin and a Jounin but the point was to ease them back into taking missions and not to throw something sudden and challenging at them.</p><p>Shikamaru didn't seem totally thrilled to go, but when I asked, it seemed to be more about the timing than the mission itself - it was only supposed to be a week, but there was always the chance that it would extend or that mom would go into labour prematurely.</p><p>"I'm sure she would forgive you," I said, bracingly, patting him on the shoulder. "Maybe get some gifts while you're there, just in case."</p><p>He didn't seem too impressed with my idea of consolation.</p><p>I, myself, settled into a rhythm of training and studying, and only took short one day or overnighter missions when I started to get too bored and itchy. There were a couple of Intel pickups that were mostly straightforward and a handful of sensory squad missions – including a bizarre one for Anbu where a group in masks took me to an apparently random section of the Konoha wall and told me to describe the jutsu that had been used on it recently. They gave no indication of whether or not anything I told them was expected, or why, and whisked me back to the tower and left me standing blinking and bewildered in the sunshine.</p><p>I mean, stranger things had happened to me. But usually with some context.</p><p>I also managed to make it to a kunoichi meeting, which had been a while. It was nice.</p><p>Anko plopped down next to me on the grass, offering me dango. "I've been meaning to talk to you."</p><p>I took a skewer, automatically flicking through any possible reasons she could have. I … couldn't see much, if I was honest. "Sure," I agreed, neutrally. "How can I help?"</p><p>She waved the point of her skewer, as though to take in the meeting around us. "You intending on making this official? The kunoichi club."</p><p>I bit down and chewed slowly to cover the pause while I thought. "Not especially," I said, slowly. "It was originally just a way to catch up with friends. Then we kept making more."</p><p>She snorted. "Whatever the reason was, it's caught on," she said dismissively. "And it's reached a critical mass now – people are starting to take notice."</p><p>"I see," I said and the trouble was I did see. I just didn't want to.</p><p>"So," she went on, "if you don't have any plans on stepping up and making it official, then I want to."</p><p>"Why?" I asked, more curious than objecting.</p><p>Anko leant back, onto one elbow, legs stretching out in front of her. "I'm making a push for Jounin," she said in a tone that was layers of resignation trying and failing to cover a spark of pride. "<em> Someone</em> made Maito Gai think that I was stepping up my training, and when Gai thinks you're training more… apparently you are."</p><p>I moved away slightly as she tried to stab me in the thigh with her dango skewer.</p><p>"You're welcome," I said serenely. "So, this is your… innovation?" That wasn't really the right word for it.</p><p>The thing was, there wasn't really a test to become a Jounin. By that point, everyone either knew you were (or not).</p><p>Combat ability was a big part of it. You <em> had</em> to be strong. That was mostly measured by missions taken (and hearsay and bingo book evaluations probably) because by the time you reached that level no one really wanted to reveal their best techniques, certainly not to a crowd like in the Chunin exams. And it was <em> really hard</em> to host an out-and-out fight at Jounin level while ensuring no one actually got hurt.</p><p>But, these days, no one was really promoted on combat ability alone. Maybe in the war that had been the case but it wasn't enough anymore. Jounin weren't just one man wrecking balls – they were leaders.</p><p>Not just <em> mission leaders</em> but… leaders of the village. The people who looked at the systems in place and didn't just meet them but <em> improved</em> them. Who contributed to the village, not just through mission performance but by challenging it. By finding gaps in the workings and fixing them. Who stepped up and said 'you need a leader here – let me be it'.</p><p>It didn't mean you'd get promoted for it. But it put your name out there. Let the higher ups know that you were the kind of person they wanted in charge.</p><p>"Have you asked the others?" I asked. In some ways this group would probably be a perfect example of demonstrating leadership abilities. Or mentorship, anyway.</p><p>"They wanted to let their Chunin ranks settle in first," she said, flicking a look over my vest. "But since you're tearing up the ranks, I thought you might be considering it."</p><p>I shook my head. "No, you should go for it."</p><p>It wasn't that I was against making it official. It was just that, if I put myself in charge, then I would be <em> responsible </em> for it. There would be work associated with it – probably a lot, if I were honest. There would probably have to be rules and teaching plans and progress reports…</p><p>And honestly, I barely even made it to these meetings these days. Trying to run them would be a headache and a half.</p><p>Anko smiled, genuinely. "Neat. I mean, I was going to do it anyway. But I've heard what happens to people who get on your bad side."</p><p>I rolled my eyes at her. "Aoba has been telling stories."</p><p>"You bet your ass he has."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Team 10 came home with all pieces present and accounted for.</p><p>"Don't act like it's a big deal," Shikamaru grumbled, rubbing the back of his neck with his good hand.</p><p>"I didn't say anything," I denied, smiling. "Here I am, just enjoying this nice sunshine and I get so <em> unjustly accused-</em> "</p><p>He reached out and shoved me in the shoulder. "Alright, alright," he said, but there was a matching grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. "I get it."</p><p>I swayed with the motion, easy and bright. "Good."</p><p>Shikamaru being back meant that Ino was also back, a whirl of colour and life that I didn't realise how badly I'd missed.</p><p>"Do you ever wish things could just… <em> last</em> ?" she asked, tucking her arm into mine and dragging me through Konoha's shopping district. I went with her easily, keeping an idle eye out for any new equipment.</p><p>"Yes," I answered quietly. "Or stop. Or turn back. But we can't do any of that."</p><p>"Oh, I know," she agreed, thoughtlessly picking through racks of field gear, always homing in on the purple. "It was just good to take a mission with the whole team again, you know? But it was over so fast."</p><p>"There'll be more," I said. "Maybe not the same, maybe not <em> everyone</em> but… there'll be more."</p><p>She looked at me, something critical passing over her face. "What a depressing topic," she said, shaking it off instead. "What do you think, this one or this one?" she held up two shirts in different cuts, but the same shade.</p><p>"The purple one," I deadpanned. "You ever consider other colours?"</p><p>She waggled a finger at me. "It's all about creating an image. Purple stands out. People will know me when they see me."</p><p>"And it's easy to take off," I said thoughtfully. "If all your field gear is one colour…" When you weren't wearing it, you were off duty. Compartmentalisation.</p><p>"You should consider it," Ino said, elbowing past me to browse another rack. "You know, actually buy civilian clothes."</p><p>I let out a laugh. "When am I off duty?" I asked. "You aren't tricking me into <em> more</em> shopping, Ino Yamanaka. I know your wiles."</p><p>She stuck her tongue out at me, playfully. "Foiled again."</p><p>I did want to pick up some glasses for my seal microscope project and I'd intended on just getting some sunglasses to experiment with. I didn't need the lenses per se, just something to look through.</p><p>Of course, being Ino, we ended up in a novelty store trying on tacky plastic frames.</p><p>"What do you think?" Ino asked, with a pair of ridiculous hearts perched on her face. "Is it me?"</p><p>"Absolutely," I said, trading a pair of shutter shades for a pair that looked like stars. "How professional do I look?"</p><p>"Very!" she cackled. "No, wait!" She reached over and unearthed a gift. "Look, the Konoha leaf."</p><p>"Perfect," I said. They were utterly ridiculous, but spirals worked well for seals. It would do. "These are about to become super high tech ninja weaponry."</p><p>Ino kept laughing. "I hope so," she wheezed. "I really, really hope so. I want you to wear them into battle one day. Just for the … the looks on everyone's <em> faces…</em> "</p><p>I laughed too. "Can you even imagine?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>"How are you feeling, Sensei?" I asked, casually.</p><p>He flicked his book shut. "Is this my follow up appointment?" He asked, wryly.</p><p>I shrugged and grinned sheepishly. "Just wanting to know if we had to pull another miracle out of our hats," I claimed. "I figured that since Tsunade-sama hadn't knocked my door down, it must have been okay."</p><p>He huffed. "Lucky you."</p><p>"Just think of how many future hospital visits you <em> don't </em> have," I pointed out. "That's gotta be something."</p><p>He ruffled my hair. "It is nice not to be exhausted all the time," he mused, which was probably as close as I was going to get to an answer.</p><p>"And the …. technique thing?" I asked, wiggling my fingers in a way that probably communicated nothing except weirdness. Weirdness was a good descriptor.</p><p>He shifted, just a little. "Working on it," he said.</p><p>Which meant. Yeah. It was in progress. Hopefully.</p><p>"Well," I said, and twisted a scroll out of hammerspace to give to him. "I don't know if it actually was a black hole, or whatever, or if this'll help but…"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei frowned slightly, unrolling the first few inches to read the notes I had painstakingly copied over from the Book of Gelel. The thing that had had an actual seal for the making of black holes. I hadn't… put the actual seal on it for him, but the science behind it might help. I didn't actually know if Kamui had anything in common with that seal, or if it was closer to storage scrolls in function. If it was that later, he probably knew enough to work it out himself.</p><p>"I'm not sure I want to ask," he said contemplatively, rerolling it and tucking it carefully into an inside pocket on his vest. "I don't know if there's an answer that will make me less concerned."</p><p>"Probably not," I admitted. "I'm not sure I could tell you, anyway. So. Best not."</p><p>He started to walk, and I fell into step beside him.</p><p>"It was definitely not that answer," he decided out loud.</p><p>Sasuke was waiting for us at the training field, which was proof that running into Kakashi-sensei hadn't been coincidence. Not that I'd needed proof, but still.</p><p>"It's been such a long time since my cute little genin trained with me," Kakashi-sensei said, so much put-upon sorrow in his voice. "So, I've decided on a team bonding exercise!"</p><p>"Okay?" I agreed, looking at Sasuke, who shrugged. It wasn't like I objected to team training. It wasn't like Sasuke objected to training, ever.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei hustled us another training field over. I felt the waiting chakra, and started to get just a little concerned.</p><p>"Gai and I decided on a little challenge," Sensei said happily. "Team verses team combat!"</p><p>"I didn't agree to that," I objected immediately, balking. There was nothing at stake here – not even a competition, just Kakashi and Gai being themselves.</p><p>Because Lee <em> and</em> Neji? We were going to get stomped. Utterly.</p><p>"The teams are uneven," Sasuke pointed out. "That's an unfair advantage." He sounded like he knew it wasn't going to work, but it was a last-ditch effort to salvage the situation.</p><p>"Indeed!" Gai boomed, suddenly much closer than he had been even half a second ago. "It compensates nicely for the higher ranking of your team!"</p><p>Sasuke contemplated that. Then turned and slugged me squarely in the arm.</p><p>I yelped. "What was that for?!"</p><p>"It's your fault," he said, crossing his arms. "<em> Special Jounin</em> ."</p><p>I glowered at him. I couldn't exactly throw his own status back in his face.</p><p>Across the clearing, Neji and Tenten were practically smirking. Lee only looked incredibly happy to be training, but I had no doubt that everyone had drawn the same conclusion we had.</p><p>Stomped. Utterly. Individually Team Gai were stupid powerhouses and together they were an unbreakable defensive formation. Ambushing them was only slightly less stupid than picking a fight when they <em> knew</em> they were about to be fighting.</p><p><em> Okay, fuck that. </em> That defeatist attitude could go directly to hell. This was going to suck and it was going to hurt and they would definitely have to fight for every inch they gained.</p><p>I shifted onto the balls of my feet and quirked an eyebrow at Sasuke. Very slowly, he nodded in response.</p><p>"Okay," I said, stretching my arms and dropping my resistance seals. I pulled my chakra up to readiness, prepping my muscles. I checked the surroundings more thoroughly with my senses – no traps set up, no surprises waiting for us, just the ceaseless determination of training pounded into the ground and trees.</p><p>Team Gai's training field was mostly just open, empty space. There was a forest at one end, littered with practice targets, but they were probably just as comfortable in the trees as we were so it wouldn't give us that much of an advantage.</p><p>"Well, then," Kakashi-sensei said, and twitched his headband up.</p><p>Gai-sensei dropped his gaze down to the ground, watching his feet.</p><p>"Go!" They said in unison, and vanished, moving fast enough and with enough intent that it was immediately, obviously clear that a fight between two Jounin was not something any of us should be in the middle of. <em> They</em> went for the trees, which at least meant we wouldn't accidentally be crossing attacks.</p><p>I pooled my shadow, circling it around both of us instantly in a defensive effort to stave off an inevitable Taijutsu attack. If they couldn't cross it, they couldn't touch us. Game, set, match. (If only.)</p><p>Beside me, Sasuke's chakra flared twice, once to activate his sharingan, and once to cast a genjutsu that settled heavily over Tenten and Lee.</p><p>Neji – Byakugan blazing – had a choice of which teammate to try and free.</p><p>He went for Lee.</p><p>Not a bad choice. He was objectively the stronger fighter – the one Sasuke and I would have the most trouble with. Tenten was probably more likely to be able to free herself.</p><p>Which just meant we had to get her out of the fight first.</p><p>Sasuke sprang sideways, putting space between us and pulling shuriken and ninja wire from his pouch and linking them together in a smooth easy movement. The wires trailed in the air as they looped around, circling Tenten and pulling tight in a rudimentary restraint.</p><p>Meanwhile, I sent my shadow racing for Neji and Lee, hoping that I could catch them in Shadow Possession Jutsu. It wasn't so far away that I worried about running out of shadows to use but they were faster than I was, even with having to shake off Lee's genjutsu.</p><p>They went backwards, retreating until I had to stop, range limit reached.</p><p>And then I was reminded that, oh yeah, Neji had distance attacks in his Jyuuken. The Vacuum Palm blasted across the clearing and I dodged, barely, the wave of chakra clipping my side and spinning me into the ground like a ragdoll.</p><p>I gasped, rolling to my feet and checking my chakra system for any damaging intrusion – but unlike the close quarters attacks, the Vacuum Palm didn't penetrate and block. It was far more like a wind technique, a forceful outside push of chakra.</p><p>Still, it stung like being scalded with too hot water.</p><p>While I was down Lee burst into motion, so goddam fast, just <em> appearing</em> next to Sasuke and kicking him in the air. It was a technique I'd seen him use – use on <em> Sasuke</em> even – before, but apparently that didn't make it any more avoidable. "Leaf Hurricane!"</p><p>Or-</p><p>I flashed through the handseals. <em> Replacement.</em></p><p>"Shadow-"</p><p>"-of the Dancing Leaf," I finished, coyly, spinning in mid-air and <em> grinning</em> down at Lee. His eyes widened, apparently not having realised that naming a technique 'shadow' in a fight with a Nara was just <em> asking for it.</em></p><p>I floated in the air, primed my shadow beneath me, and caught him in its grip easily. The thing about being in mid-air was that it made manoeuvrability difficult – that had probably been a benefit to this technique, to keep his opponent from being able to escape or strike back, but it affected him just as much.</p><p>Sasuke was busy, down below, keeping Neji at bay. He was… on fire? Well I guessed that was one way of keeping a Taijutsu user from engaging up close. Neji's sleeves were smouldering but it seemed like his Jyuuken was protecting his hands enough that it didn't bother him a whole lot.</p><p>Sasuke's chakra sabre being put to use as well, trying to fend off attacks when they came too close. A sword didn't have tenketsu to close, but I could feel a wavering in his chakra that meant that at least a few hits had gotten past it.</p><p>I landed, rolling us both with Shadow Possession, and then raced through handseals, being very, <em> very </em> careful not to lose control of him. One slip and I wouldn't even have time to notice having screwed up, because I would be done for.</p><p>"Infinite Pocket!" Tenten shouted, and yeah, we'd had a good few seconds of having her out of the fight. "Pinpoint Barrage!" There was a yelp from Sasuke and the sound of metal on metal as he deflected whatever obscene amount of weaponry she threw at him.</p><p><em> Better him than me.</em></p><p>I finished my jutsu. "Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall!" I built it up around Lee, caging him up over his shoulders. Trapped. Without leverage he – hopefully – shouldn't be able to escape.</p><p>And not a fraction of a second too soon, because Neji – free of fighting Sasuke for a brief moment while Tenten distracted him – was bearing down on me with all the inevitability of an avalanche.</p><p><em> Too close! </em></p><p>I needed distance. Fighting a Hyuuga at close range was the height of foolishness, especially for me. Hinata wrecked me badly enough at Taijutsu that I didn't need to see how a fight with Neji would end. I needed to stall him for a second, to get some range, to regroup with Sasuke.</p><p>I didn't have time for a jutsu. Instead I grabbed a seal tag out of my pouch and thrust it into the air.</p><p>"Barrier Seal!" A square of light erupted out of it, translucent but solid, hovering in the air like a wall.</p><p>Neji hesitated, fractionally, eyes sweeping over it with the intensity of the Byakugan.</p><p>Then he struck it, glowing hands slamming into it, three times in quick succession.</p><p>It shattered.</p><p>"Well fuck," I said.</p><p>I wheeled backwards, feet scrambling, trying for distance even as I could calculate that it was never going to work. Neji was faster than me. I'd never get far enough.</p><p>"You are within the range of my divination," he said, sliding into a low stance that, honestly, looked like it promised a lot of pain coming my way. Nope. Nope. Nope.</p><p><em> Change of plans.</em></p><p>I shifted my weight back onto the ball of my foot, charging chakra into my necklace and going from 'flight' to 'fight'.</p><p>Neji's eyes widened as I met the first palm of his thirty-two, not with any attack of my own but with my whole body, pushing forward into it. The chakra of his Jyuuken blew the shadows out of my torso, his arm suspended in empty air, and I collapsed my shape into nothingness, into a pool of darkness.</p><p>Right on top of his face.</p><p>Now he was the one trying to wheel backwards, a muffled shout rising in his throat. Muffled because I was muffling it, my not-body as physical as a Shadow Neckbind Jutsu.</p><p>This wasn't exactly a jutsu I'd planned to use in sparring, but enough people had probably seen it by now that it was only 'mostly' secret.</p><p><em> Can he see?</em> I wondered, somewhat abstractly, as I pinched his nose closed and wormed tendrils down his neck to press down on his carotid artery in a move that was so nicely called a 'blood choke'. Pressing the artery briefly blocked blood flow to the brain, inducing a very efficient loss of consciousness. Suffocation was markedly less efficient but I could attest to it being really fucking distracting.</p><p>His hands clawed through my Shadow State, but there was nothing for them to grab. I was pressure without mass, force without substance.</p><p>His chakra surged and flared as he tried to throw me off, a full body Jyuuken strike that probably would have managed if my choke-hold hadn't kicked in.</p><p>I pulled off, forming back into a <em> me</em> shape, and then slapped an actual Knockout Tag on him to keep him unconscious because I didn't want to do that again. Fuck no, that had been close.</p><p>In the time I'd been fighting Neji, Sasuke had covered the entire area in Mist and that and his Anbu trained stealth were probably the only reasons he'd been able to hold off Lee -<em> shit when did he get free - </em> and Tenten at the same time.</p><p><em> Well.</em></p><p>I considered and then threw a transformation jutsu over myself, taking to the mist as a perfect replica of Neji. I doubted it would last for very long, but all I needed was to get close enough to get an opening.</p><p>Easier said than done. But with some tricky shadow work, a pair of Sasuke's shadow clones and a frankly over powered lightning jutsu conducted along Tenten's far-too-many metallic weapons… we ended up victorious.</p><p><em> Huh.</em></p><p>"Should we go and back up Sensei?" Sasuke asked, staring thoughtfully in the direction of the Jounin fight.</p><p>I considered. Deeply. For about a millisecond. "Nah. This was his idea, he can suffer."</p><p>I set Lee down gently on the ground and took the Knockout Tag off of Neji. Lee was definitely <em> out</em> of it – which was the only way to ever get him to stop fighting, and even then… - but Tenten was only trembling faintly and occasionally giving off random static shocks.</p><p>Which was honestly one of the funniest side effects of being hit with lightning jutsu that I'd ever seen.</p><p>"Point," Sasuke agreed.</p><p>I sighed and flopped down on the ground, resentfully pulling out my sealing notebook to try and re-jig my barrier seal.</p><p>I hadn't considered Jyuuken. Which wasn't a massive oversight in itself, but if Jyuuken could do it then chances were that there were other chakra based attacks that could as well. And that wasn't a thing that was nice to find out in the middle of combat.</p><p>Speaking of the devil – he blinked awake. Clearly disorientated, but not really surprised to find himself surrounded by his team. Given that Lee was still out of it, he probably didn't need to ask how the fight had ended, either.</p><p>"So, did you overload it, short circuit it or was there a fault in the chakra matrix?" I asked, not really bothering to segue into it.</p><p>Neji blinked. "The repeating pattern wasn't stable," he said, pushing himself into a sitting position.</p><p>A fault, probably, then. I groaned and dropped my forehead to the ground. This was why people didn't make single tag barrier seals. They were the worst.</p><p>The silence as we waited for Kakashi-sensei and Gai to finish fighting was awkward at best and tense at worst. Even after Lee woke up. Maybe especially after Lee woke up, because he wasn't exactly upset about losing but he was immediately determined to <em> improve.</em></p><p>"Kakashi-sensei," I said, severely, when they limped back into the clearing looking a little rough around the edges. "You owe us lunch."</p><p>He looked immediately delighted. "Did you <em> win?</em> "</p><p>"Hey," Sasuke objected. "Why do you sound surprised?! You're the one that told us to fight."</p><p>"I had nothing but faith in you," Kakashi-sensei said, curling his visible eye in to an exaggerated smile. "My genin team is the best genin team."</p><p>"Not genin," I pointed out, futilely. That was a losing battle if ever there was one. "No one in this training field is a genin."</p><p><hr /></p><p>AN: Me: You know, it's been a while since I've written a fight scene, maybe- nope. Nope, still hate them. Confirmed.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hospital Arc: Chapter 127</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 127</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky. ~ Rabindranath Tagore</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I'd been a little off base in suggesting that only 'two or three' would remain after the lectures. It was closer to ten.</p><p>Still a huge decrease in numbers from 'all' but way more interest than I thought there would be. (There had, briefly, been a spike in numbers once we'd moved from 'general theory' to 'explosive notes' but it had vanished pretty quickly under the sheer tidal wave of math that was responsible for even the smallest of booms.)</p><p>It was still mostly RnD people, Takatori and Nanto chief among them, but Kurome and Yuumei were both field chunin.</p><p>"There are others who prefer self-study," Takatori had told me, once, during the course. "Since the materials are all going to be available, anyway, they found it difficult to schedule time for the lectures."</p><p>He might have expected me to be upset about that, but I really wasn't. It was a) how I'd learnt in the first place and b) pretty much what I wanted out of this.</p><p>We'd managed to downsize enough to fit back into the RnD meeting room, though. That was something.</p><p>"Okay," I said, dropping into a chair at the table and slouching. "No more lectures. This is going to be more like… a workshop. A study group. You're all going to be helping each other as much as I'm helping you."</p><p>That got me a variety of blank stares.</p><p>"What you have to realize," I said, "is that I packaged up nearly everything I've been studying in the last year and a half. Congratulations. That's it. That's all I know." I spread my hands, palms empty. "You've caught up to me. The trick from here on out is going to be find a sealing method that you, individually, can understand and modify."</p><p>"And how do we go about that?" Nanto asked, just a little apprehensively.</p><p>I shrugged. "When we covered the variations, were there any parts that stood out as being more logical than others? That made more inherent sense to you? Personally-" I sketched a quick seal on the whiteboard. "- mine a very heavily mathematical and scientific method. I understand what I want to do by quantifying it and its effects. It means I can get very specific and can change variables to be flexible, but it isn't the <em> only</em> way of doing things."</p><p>"But the only way you can help us with, right?" Takatori asked, leaning back.</p><p>"Which is why you might have to help each other," I agreed. "But you could do worse than start with what's familiar and then work your way onwards. The standard Konoha style was created by Jiraiya-"</p><p>It was pretty slow going. No one seemed to have found a way to 'click' the way I had when Jiraiya had tipped my idea of sealing upside down, but they'd also been studying it for a far shorter period of time. Maybe not all of these would find a way to 'click', but even then, the ability to breakdown other people's seals and tell what they'd been doing wasn't to be scoffed at.</p><p>But we didn't actually get too far with it, because halfway through my allotted time period, Shikamaru knocked on the door impatiently.</p><p>"Mom's in hospital!" he blurted out the instant he saw me. "I just took her there now."</p><p>I nodded. "It's about that time," I acknowledged, shuffling my notes together and passing them to Tenten. "Did you fetch dad already?"</p><p>"The hospital sent a runner to him," he said, already on his way back out the door.</p><p><em> And they couldn't exactly send one here.</em> Well, not unless they had a Nara right on hand. Hence Shikamaru coming to get me himself.</p><p>"Sorry," I said to the group. "Duty calls. These are the worksheets and some example seals. Maybe try to break them down, or re-create them in another style?"</p><p>Tenten hovered awkwardly, half standing from the table. "Should I-?"</p><p>"You could finish up here?" I suggested. "I mean, you could come, but I think they have a visitor limit and it's just going to be a lot of waiting around at the hospital."</p><p>I couldn't tell whether she liked or didn't like that answer, but she did sit back down.</p><p>"Give our best wishes to Yoshino-sama!"</p><p>Shikamaru was already gone, but I didn't exactly rush. I was no expert, but babies didn't <em> hurry</em> . Since it was on the way, I stopped by the Yamanaka flower shop to let Ino know, and suspected that that would take care of the rest.</p><p>At the hospital, mom was in a private birthing room in the maternity ward and there was a pretty strict 'two visitor' policy in order to keep crowding down. Dad was already there, and Shikamaru switched out with me so I could go in.</p><p>"Do you need anything?" I offered. "I can go and fetch stuff. Or people. Or whatever."</p><p>"It's all under control," Mom assured me. "Funny enough, I've done this before."</p><p>I laughed. "I suspected as much," I said sagely. "I'll send Shikamaru back in, okay? Before he starts harassing the nurses for updates."</p><p>It might have been an exaggeration, but it also might not have been. The waiting room served the whole ward and was a fair distance from where mom was, and while Shikamaru wasn't pacing, he did bolt out of his chair the second I came back.</p><p>"You can go back in; I'll wait here," I told him.</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"I can tell what's going on," I said, tapping my index finger to my temple, which wasn't <em> exactly</em> a signal for sensory techniques but was probably understandable. Also, maybe not <em> exactly true</em> for this situation, but I could track the comings and goings of nurses and medic nin so that was close enough.</p><p>"Right," Shikamaru said, looking relieved.</p><p>So, I waited. There were other people in the waiting rooms, groups coming and going to the other women in the ward and I idly tracked the movement of people around me, like a busy swarm, all with jobs and purpose and winding their way past each other. Eventually Ino and her dad showed up with massive bouquets and the Akimichi followed shortly after that. Tenten sidled in, looking awkward, and then so did Sasuke much, much later.</p><p>And then, finally, the buzz of activity in mom's room got busier. A pair of medic-nin came and stayed.</p><p>Shikamaru stumbled out, looking a little grey in the face. "You can go in."</p><p><em> Yeah, no. </em> I gently put my book over my face. "No thanks," I said, muffled and then pretended to be asleep.</p><p>Inoichi chuckled and patted my head as he moved past. "Well, if it's anything like when you two were born, your dad might need someone to hold his hand."</p><p>"That sounds like a story," I said, still muffled. But I was glad Inoichi had volunteered to go, because I didn't particularly want to. I'd never seen a non-TV birth and I was content to keep it that way.</p><p>From a distance was bad enough. Mom's chakra kept flaring and shuddering with pain, probably timed with contractions or something, but it was distracting. It just kept going on and on.</p><p>And then it didn't. The room started to empty out, nurses continuing onto other rooms and Inoichi making his way back to us.</p><p>I took the book off my face and peered down the hallway.</p><p>He was smiling. "They're just moving them to an overnight room now," he said. "Then we can all go and visit."</p><p>Shikamaru let out a very long sigh and sagged into the plastic hospital chair. "What a drag."</p><p>Ino rolled her eyes at him so I didn't have to. "You didn't even do anything," she pointed out. "Come on, at least carry the flowers!"</p><p>It was a pretty cheerful group that shuffled through the halls of the maternity ward, all told. The tension from waiting had fizzled out, and all that was left was a kind of happy, eager anticipation.</p><p>The hospital room was pretty cheerful as far as hospital rooms went, and became more so the minute we all piled in, Ino setting up the flowers on the side table and a fruit basket materialising from somewhere – probably the Akimichi, though how it hadn't been eaten during the wait I didn't know.</p><p>Dad was holding a swaddled bundle but I sidled through the crowd and closer to mom. She was half asleep and looked kinda drugged, and her hair was all sweaty and there were lines of pain around her eyes, but she looked okay. She took my hand and gave me a smile.</p><p>Dad cleared his throat. "I'm pleased to introduce the newest member of our family," he said. "Kinokawa Nara." He tilted the bundle towards us and Shikamaru stepped up to hold it.</p><p>"After my family," Mom murmured quietly.</p><p>I squeezed her hand and wondered. Was it a weird choice of name? Or no weirder than calling a kid 'Konohamaru'? Was that just a homage to her family, naming a son after them? Or a subtle statement to the clan? <em> You took the twins but this one is mine?</em></p><p>Or was I overthinking it? Did it even matter?</p><p>"Kino-chan, huh?" Shikamaru asked, looking pretty besotted.</p><p>"Come and hold him," Dad said, beckoning me over.</p><p>I untangled myself from mom and awkwardly received the baby from Shikamaru, Dad monitoring the transfer to ensure safety and baby neck support.</p><p><em> Yep,</em> I thought. <em> That is a baby.</em></p><p>It looked like a baby, kind of squished and red, swaddled in a whole lot of white blankets. Tiny - very dangerously tiny and breakable – but just… a baby. I looked at it and tried to feel but there was no sudden rush of love, of connection or possession or anything that I saw in my family's faces. There was nothing but faint awkwardness.</p><p>It felt like mom, chakra wise. Exactly like her. Which was…strange. I remembered the feeling of growing chakra coils and itching, so I supposed infants didn't develop their own immediately.</p><p><em> How long is appropriate to hold it?</em> I wondered. <em> Thirty seconds? Or is that too short?</em></p><p>I couldn't remember, in that other life, if I'd loved my siblings immediately. Had I? Or had I been too small, too young to be anything but curious about it.</p><p>But I hadn't… I hadn't loved Shikamaru immediately. Or mom or dad. I'd been too lost and confused. But I did now. I did <em> now. </em> It just- time. That was all. I'd just need time.</p><p>"Aww," Ino cooed, leaning over my shoulder. "He's got his mom's eyes. Going to be such a heartbreaker when you grow up, aren't you?"</p><p><em> How on earth could she tell? </em></p><p>"Uh, congratulations," Sasuke said, edging towards the door. His eyes were suspiciously sharingan red. "I have to go. So. Congratulations, again."</p><p>"You're going to leave without holding him?" I asked, seeing an excellent opportunity for a handover. <em> Sorry Sasuke. It's every man for himself in situations like this.</em></p><p>Sasuke glanced at dad, seeking reassurance and/or release from obligations. Seeing as he ended up next to me, I knew what answer he'd received. His hands felt a lot steady and surer than mine, but since his sharingan was on I knew it was all a dirty lie.</p><p>Ino sighed and threw her arms over my shoulders from behind me. "So <em> cute.</em> "</p><p>"You can be next in the baby holding brigade, you know," I said, folding my arms so no one tried to put a baby back in them.</p><p>She laughed. "No, I think Shikamaru is staking a claim for another turn," she said. "It's okay. There'll be plenty more days."</p><p>I hummed an agreement.</p><p>People didn't so much as drift away as much as get very competently ushered out by Inoichi when an appropriate 'visiting time' had passed with lots of comments to mom about getting plenty of rest. Setsuko Akimichi promised that she was personally going to feed the lot of us for the next week – at least! – so we better not even try to cook.</p><p>I mean, obviously, we protested the kindness, but only for forms sake. She was a fantastic cook. It was an argument I was happy to lose.</p><p>Mom stayed in hospital for the next few days, so it was only the three of us at home overnight which was… odd. It wasn't that the house was empty or anything like that, but the house without <em> mom</em> was unusual. Usually she was the one you could count on to be there.</p><p>I ended up winning the 'who relocates downstairs' contest, pretty much on account of the fact that I could pack everything up into hammerspace and empty my room out within seconds. After that it was up to us to set up the crib and baby things that mom and dad – read: dad under instructions from mom – had carefully unearthed from the attic in preparation.</p><p>Which mostly amounted to dad and Shikamaru puzzling over disassembled pieces of wood and an odd number of screws, while I stacked soft toys into piles and shoved baby clothes into the closet.</p><p>"Oh hey," I said, picking up a fuzzy bear that had been Shikamaru's particular favourite. "It's Kage-kage."</p><p>And when Shikamaru looked up I beaned him right in the face with it.</p><p>He spluttered and protested.</p><p>Dad sighed. "Children."</p><p><hr /></p><p>About a week later, I woke, disorientated, not because of nightmares or alarm, but because there had been a surge of chakra in my room.</p><p>A small one. It still had me on my feet and armed before I was really aware, but the house was still and silent around me. Everyone else was asleep.</p><p>I put my kunai away and padded on silent feet towards my desk.</p><p><em> There</em> .</p><p>The coin – the twin of the one I had given Tokichi – had changed. I checked it frequently, hadn't honestly expected to be able to feel the activation, and knew with absolute certainty that the numbers on it were different.</p><p>I jotted down the coordinates and considered the time. It probably wasn't so urgent that I had to rush off <em> now</em> , before the sun was even in the sky. But neither could I afford to delay by any considerable amount.</p><p>I compromised, getting dressed and slipping outside to head to the tower. The Intel Department was always active anyway, and nightshift suited my needs well enough.</p><p>I logged the message in – information requiring pick up.</p><p>It was a fake, of course, but there were many reasons and ways to log in a fake message in Intel. There were plenty of codes, plenty of fake ninja ID's to use (some wholesale invented, some poor saps that continued to serve the village after their untimely deaths) to make it <em> look</em> , objectively, like everything was as it was supposed to be.</p><p>But I authorised the pick up under my own name, sending myself to do it, and filled out the associated mission scroll to go with it. If it was tracked back, it would still come to me – I wasn't trying to avoid that. I just didn't want a second party to have to sign off on it right now.</p><p>Then I submitted the first, tucked the second into my vest and went home to make breakfast.</p><p>I ran into Tenten on the way, which wasn't exactly unusual given the hours that Team Gai preferred for training, but we were literally going in the opposite directions so it indicated she'd been at my house.</p><p>And seemed, if not upset, then slightly annoyed.</p><p>"Everything okay?" I hazarded.</p><p>She forced a smile. "Yeah, fine. Hey, did you want to spar or something later?"</p><p>"I… can't, sorry. I have a mission," I said hesitantly. And the obvious conclusion from the facts presented to me… "Did Shikamaru not want to?"</p><p>"I thought that since the baby was here now he wouldn't be so preoccupied with it," she said. "I mean. I get it. Family is important," she added hastily, fluttering her hands. "It's fine."</p><p>"Ah," I said, then cast around desperately for something to say. I didn't actually want to get in the middle of relationship things. "Well. If you have time and want to hit things therapeutically, could you destruction test some barrier seals for me?"</p><p>She snorted, but the smile seemed a little more real. "That does sound pretty fun."</p><p>"If you write it down, it becomes science," I said wisely.</p><p>At home, Shikamaru was in the kitchen, starting to prepare breakfast. Mom and Dad were moving around in the nursery upstairs, probably feeding Kino breakfast. The baby had been pretty quiet, so far, but that might have been because night-time feedings were done with all the precision timing that proved this was a ninja household.</p><p>"You skipped your chores," Shikamaru said, disapprovingly as I washed my hands and slipped in next to him to help.</p><p>"Sorry," I said. "I had to go to the tower. I have a mission." I shrugged. "Should only be a short one – in and out."</p><p>"Now?" He said with… mostly surprise. A bit of disappointment.</p><p>"It should only be a short one," I repeated. "I'll be back before you know it."</p><p>We fell silent, moving together to prepare breakfast, orbiting around the kitchen with easy grace. It wasn't hard, for all that this wasn't really something we usually did together.</p><p>"What are you thinking?" he asked, suddenly.</p><p>I looked at him, breaking my gaze away from the window. "Huh? Oh. That I could probably put a Four Seal Barrier around the house if I tag it to those two trees and the posts out front. It's not square, but I'm pretty sure I could make a trapezoid work."</p><p>He blinked. "Okay. That was not where I thought that was going to go." He paused. "How would you activate it, thought? From the corners?"</p><p>I hummed. "That doesn't sound very efficient, now that you mention it. Maybe… I could put a trigger seal in the house…"</p><p>That at least provoked a spirited conversation between us, bouncing ideas about security versus safety versus practicality.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Hot Springs Arc: Chapter 128</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 128</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still ~ Franklin D. Roosevelt</p><p></em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Tokichi's coordinates took me to a small town in the north-west of the Land of Fire – fairly close to the Kubisaki Pass, actually – that was mostly just a collection of shops and houses around a crossroads.</p><p>There was a tavern, though, next to the general store, and given how we'd meet Tokichi in the Land of Stone, that was where I headed after checking the surroundings.</p><p>It wasn't a dingy place, or anything like that. It was clearly a place that saw a lot of <em> use</em> but it was in good repair. Clean, respectable, the kind of place frequented by both locals and travellers with a fair degree of confidence.</p><p>I would probably seem a bit out of place – a young girl travelling alone – but there was also no reason to be particularly stealthy and hide that fact.</p><p>Inside, I spotted Tokichi immediately, his raggedy coat and cowboy hat standing out. The other man with him was recognisable as the other bounty hunter that we'd run into on that mission. Gashi? No, that wasn't it.</p><p>"Sazanami," I murmured, approaching the table. I dropped a genjutsu over it as I went, shielding it from too much attention. "Gatsu."</p><p>Tokichi rose from this seat and tipped his hat. "Well hello there, little lady," he said. "It's good to see you again."</p><p>Gatsu looked much less impressed. "So, this was who you were wanting to meet," he said.</p><p>"It is," Tokichi confirmed, not seeming perturbed by his partner's distaste. He sat back down and I took the invitation to draw a chair, too. "I wasn't sure how quickly you would arrive."</p><p>"As quickly as I could," I answered.</p><p>Without any preamble, he took a small soft cover notebook out of his pocket and slid it across the table to me. It was beaten and a little dirty and there was half a pencil jammed into the spine but it was – if it had <em> anything</em> in it – worth far more than its weight in gold.</p><p>I trapped it under my hand so that there was no possible way I could lose it. "Thank you," I said, sincerely.</p><p>"It's mostly rumour," Tokichi cautioned. "Second hand, third hand… most of it is pretty wild." He took his hat off and scratched his hair. "We never got anywhere near the guy himself."</p><p>"Good," I said, and meant it. "Firstly, here. We have a fund to pay the people who help us. It's not very much, but I really appreciate what you've done."</p><p>"Ah, you kids helped me first." He tried to wave it off, and reject the payment, but I was serious about it. It was more of a risk than he understood, and he'd come through for me.</p><p>"Secondly, please contact me again if you come across more information," I requested. "Or if you need help."</p><p>Tokichi chuckled a tad uneasily. "About that," he said and exchanged a glance with Gatsu.</p><p>I leant back. "What is it?" I asked, more curious than anything. I <em> was</em> willing to help him, I just hadn't expected it to be called so fast.</p><p>"We're hunting a bounty," Gatsu said bluntly. "And they say there's a ninja involved."</p><p>"Okay," I said slowly. "That could be… complicated. Do you know if it's a missing nin or what village they're from?"</p><p>International relations were tense enough right now that no one would appreciate it if I threw myself in the middle of more and stirred it up, without it even being tangentially related to my mission.</p><p>"We were hoping you could find out," Tokichi said, reluctantly. "The bounty itself shouldn't be a problem for us, but if there's a ninja involved we wouldn't dare."</p><p>That was awfully clever of them. Then again, they had at least known one set of ninja and could probably work out when they were in over their heads.</p><p>"I should be able to tell that pretty easily," I said, narrowing my eyes in thought. I had great sensory range and it wasn't asking anything precise. Just… ninja? Yes or no. "Who are they? <em> Where</em> are they?"</p><p>Tokichi looked uneasy again. "They're human traffickers," he said. "Not here – closer to the border. We spent a couple of weeks trying to feel them out and that's when we heard there might be ninja involved."</p><p>That… wasn't good. Even if it <em> was</em> a ninja village involved. It was maybe <em> even less good</em> if a ninja village was involved. Sound? But this was a long way for them to come for random people who weren't even ninja, when Orochimaru had a whole country to pick from. And many closer neighbours.</p><p>"They're taking mostly young girls," Gatsu said, bluntly.</p><p>Well. It wouldn't be like anyone at home would be particularly <em> surprised</em> if I managed to stumble my way into a situation like this. The immediate, easiest option available to me right now was to play bait.</p><p>That made it clear why Tokichi was unhappy. Gatsu didn't really look thrilled, either, despite the attitude. And he hadn't even known I was coming, apparently.</p><p>But <em> human traffickers of young girls</em> sounded horrifying no matter how you put it.</p><p>"Okay," I said, very, very focused. "Tell me what you know."</p><p>If this resulted in a political problem, then politics could have a problem with me.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Many people had a problem with me that day.</p><p>I was on incredible high alert, just from the potential connection to Orochimaru, which mostly just resulted in <em> a lot</em> of overkill.</p><p>The ninja on staff was <em> barely</em> a Chunin – more than enough to be a problem to Tokichi and Gatsu, but nowhere near enough to stand in my way while I was incredibly, horribly, morally offended by what was going on here.</p><p>"Which one was your bounty?" I asked, casually showing Gatsu and Tokichi the pile of tied up, concussed and unconscious men.</p><p>They were still alive. For now.</p><p>"I thought you were just going to scout it out," Tokichi said weakly. "We were going to help you with the attack."</p><p>"Plans changed," I said with a shrug. "There was a ninja, after all."</p><p>I organised prisoner transfer with the nearest outpost and wrote up an investigative request for the possible connection to Orochimaru – even though in hindsight I doubted it. An Orochimaru-controlled operation would have been ninja-controlled not just using a single Chunin as muscle. And whatever you could say about him, Hidden Sound ninja were competent.</p><p>No, this looked more like a case of people being horrible to each other <em> without</em> ninja involvement.</p><p>The trip back to Konoha wasn't exactly tense, but I was aware of the potential information I was carrying – sealed into my arm in the safest way I could – and how important it was. I was pretty eager to get stuck into it, but there was no way I was doing that out here.</p><p>I had to go through all the motions of returning from a mission – including logging the slightly-out-of-parameters deviation without mentioning that my contacts had been bounty hunters or that I'd done it purposefully and not totally by accident.</p><p>But once that was done I managed to retreat to my desk in the Intel Division and unseal the notes.</p><p>I transcribed them as I went, so that I could retain the original copy for myself, and it was pretty obvious that Tokichi had never really had any training in this field. Then again, that was true for a large portion of the informants we worked with, so it wouldn't really stand out.</p><p>He had, however, started the first page with Kakuzu's name and then a basic physical description - likely cobbled together from various accounts from different people given how inconsistent it was – and that was enough to allow me to dig up an extremely old Bingo Book page and attach it.</p><p><em> And bingo was his name-o!</em></p><p>That would definitely help, even if it was ludicrously out of date.</p><p>The rest of the information was a hodgepodge of facts. Tokichi had written it all down in the order he'd learnt it, which wasn't necessarily the same order that it had <em> happened</em> in. He had, thoughtfully, included the locations of the bounty stations and towns he'd been in however, and if the information had come with any timeframes.</p><p>I tried to order it into some kind of coherent timeline, though I initially ran into some confusion when Kakuzu's partner was described and it was very clearly not Hidan.</p><p><em> That</em> cleared itself up within short notice, because the very same body had been turned in for its bounty months later, sans heart. That had been written very clearly, and had pretty obviously been a topic for some gossip, even amongst people who had bodies of all states of injury handed in for cash.</p><p>When I transcribed that, I underlined the point several times and put a large, questioning '<em> jutsu?'</em> comment next to it. I had no information to point out what it was he could do with those, but it was very clearly a Something and I would highlight it until people took it seriously.</p><p>It sounded like the earliest of rumours was at least several years old and the newest was still several months out of date. During that timeframe Kakuzu had gone through several partners – all high ranking missing ninja – before landing with Hidan.</p><p>His name wasn't in there, of course. But there was a single, solitary mention of 'Jashin' and that was enough for me to connect it back to the Jashin Cult that had originated in the Land of Hot Springs.</p><p><em> Boom.</em> <em> Done</em> .</p><p>I resisted the urge to cackle and rub my hands together. Instead, I very calmly assigned myself a follow up mission to investigate.</p><p>And then I took it all up to Tsunade. Handing the last set of important information to her had worked, so I saw no reason to try a different strategy this time.</p><p>"This is Akatsuki?" she asked, flipping through the report I'd written. I'd done my best to analyse it and draw connections without getting too wild but I couldn't exactly slip in information about his fighting style other than pointing out the star-studded list of bounties and the damage they had had.</p><p>I nodded. "My informant got confirmation on the cloaks and it matches the information that Jiraiya-sama had. Seems like their internal politics aren't exactly stable if they're turning their own members in for bounties."</p><p>"Could be good for us," she mused, lacing her fingers together. "But it worries me that they're able to just keep recruiting."</p><p>There couldn't be <em> that</em> many S-rank missing ninja. There weren't that many S-rank ninja in total. For them all to wind up in the orbit of Akatsuki, regardless of personalities or motivations didn't say anything good.</p><p>"I want to follow up on this reference to Jashin," I said. "I know the cult originated in the Land of Hot Springs, and while there might not be anything there any longer, it's worth checking out. I think it's a good lead."</p><p>I handed her the scroll with the follow up investigation to sign, and for the first time in the conversation, she frowned.</p><p>"Land of Hot Springs? That's right between us and Lightning Country…" She raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "You think I'm going to send you there alone? I'm assigning Aoba to go with you."</p><p>I thought about protesting it – I was the one that knew what I was looking for, and, if need be, could have just… made it up if I didn't find anything concrete – but she had a solid point. Given the status of things with Hidden Cloud, it would be dumb to go alone.</p><p>"Okay," I said. "I'll let him know to prepare for a mission."</p><p>Tsunade threw the scroll back to me, her signature in ink on the bottom. "Keep it quiet," she advised. "It's Akatsuki, so it's highly classified, but the best cover is for it just to look like a normal mission."</p><p><em> That</em> I knew. "You got it, Hokage-sama," I said.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Two days later, Aoba and I set out from the village in pretty much the same way we had for any of our other intelligence division missions. He'd convinced me to delay our departure for a few days because, contrary to most expectations, he was actually a professional who took things very seriously. He wanted as much background information on where we were going, what we were looking for and why as he could get.</p><p>That wasn't uncommon, actually. Mostly that stuff was included in the mission briefing, or ninja general knowledge about the area. This was an unusual case, and while I <em> knew</em> , he didn't.</p><p>"Nice day for it," he said, adjusting his sunglasses as we stepped past the gates. He waved to the shinobi on duty but didn't stop to chat. "Well, I suppose we better get a move on."</p><p>It took us two days of reasonably paced travel to even get to the Konoha outpost near the north-east border and when we got there it wasn't to good news.</p><p>"We're on high alert," the ninja at the outpost told us. "No one passes through. Not without the Commanders approval."</p><p>"Travel restrictions?" Aoba wondered, running a hand through his hair. "Are things that bad?"</p><p>She hesitated, which was a sign.</p><p>"Come on, Hirameki," Aoba cajoled – huh, apparently, he knew her. Well. He really did seem to know everyone. "What is it? Was there an attack?"</p><p>"There've been a couple," she said, lowering her voice and leaning in closer. "Just, you know, the usual. But we had a scouting team in Hot Spring Country yesterday – one with a Hyuuga, right?"</p><p>"And they saw something?" he asked, voice just as low, leaning in close, the perfect picture of eager gossip.</p><p>She nodded, long hair swinging. "Right. Not just something. He swore he saw a whole camp of Cloud ninja. Not just a team or two. We're talking <em> hundreds </em> of the bastards<em> .</em> "</p><p>My breath caught in my throat.</p><p>"In Hot Springs?" Aoba asked, voice hushed for real.</p><p>"Yeah," she confirmed. "And if they're that far down… that means they're here to fight, right? You don't occupy another country just for kicks, do you?"</p><p>It certainly didn't <em> sound</em> any good.</p><p>"We already sent for reinforcements," she went on. "But they'll take time to mobilise." There was silence as that sank in. Time for the message to arrive, time to decide what to do, who to send, time for them to travel… if they hadn't had any advance warning then that amount of time would be too much. It might still be. "Hey, why did you want to get through anyway?"</p><p>"Intel mission," Aoba said, and managed to distract her from asking any more about it than that. We got the name of the outpost Commander from her though, which we needed.</p><p>"What do you want to do?" He asked me, quietly, when we were alone.</p><p>I bit my lip. "If the fighting starts now, it's not going to die off. We won't have any more luck trying again at a later date."</p><p>"That's true," he agreed. "The question is… is the risk worth it?"</p><p>Tsunade had ranked this as an S-rank mission, which meant that by any account it was. We were looking for information for a matter that had incredible political consequences.</p><p>That didn't mean this was the <em> only</em> way to get that information. Unfortunately, it was the only way I could think of and the only way at hand. If we passed it up, who knew when another option would arise.</p><p>And, furthermore, I had a personal stake in this in the form of Naruto. Akatsuki were directly after him.</p><p>Aoba didn't have that.</p><p>"I could order you to remain here and go on myself," I said idly. "Split the difference."</p><p>He snorted. "Don't even try that. Hokage-sama would kill me, anyway. I guess that means you want to push on?"</p><p>I nodded, as decisively as I could. "Yeah. If we head in undercover as civilians and try to stick to the main populated areas, we should be able to avoid conflict. We're not here to deal with Hidden Cloud."</p><p>Aoba nodded back. "Sounds like a plan." He paused. "I mean, not a particularly good one or anything. But it meets the requirements of 'A Plan'."</p><p>"Rude," I huffed.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Hot Springs Arc: Chapter 129</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p><strong> WARNING:</strong> Blood and violence. I mean, more than usual.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 129</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Let me tell you what I wish I'd known</p><p>When I was young and dreamed of glory:</p><p>You have no control:</p><p>Who lives, who dies, who tells your story</em></p><p><em> ~ Hamilton; The Musical</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Aoba and I stripped ourselves of anything ninja related – our headbands, our flak jackets, my clan symbol… and all our weapons. We sealed them away, so they were still at hand, but I felt supremely uncomfortable. I'd never been in such a perilous position with no weapons at all – heck, it had been <em> months</em> since I'd even left the house without my kunai pouch.</p><p>I even, reluctantly, undid my very identifiable braid and let my hair hang loose. It was immediately whipped about by the wind that barely existed, tangling up and flying into my face. Forget looks, any kunoichi that fought with loose hair had clearly mastered an arcane and mystical art.</p><p>Aoba threw his arm around my shoulder. "Don't sweat it, little sister," he said. "We're just two totally civilian travellers heading to the famous hot springs for a holiday."</p><p>I tried to relax my shoulders. "Absolutely civilian, nothing to see here," I agreed.</p><p>We doubled back, heading south until we hit the main highway from Land of Fire to Land of Hot Springs. It was pretty quiet, actually – a side effect of the border stalemate meant that we'd been funnelling anyone who didn't need to go this way away for months now. The lockdown would only increase that… and if it came to outright fighting? Well. Only those brave, stupid, or utterly without options would try and cross that.</p><p>We hashed out our cover as we went – nothing complicated, and we'd already had a stash of Intel Division fall-back excuses on tap, but it wouldn't be a good idea to contradict each other, and with increased ninja presence in the area it would be a good idea to have harmless reasons why we were poking our noses into things.</p><p>And despite our precautions, we didn't run into any signs of Cloud ninja on the way. I didn't even sense any. That didn't mean they weren't watching from a distance, but clearly this invasion was still in the 'secrecy' stage and not the 'outright occupancy' stage.</p><p>We arrived pretty late in the afternoon, close to sundown. The main tourist destination in the Land of Hot Springs was a town that had once been the Village Hidden in Hot Water – only now there were no ninja left. They'd sort of just… faded away and the village itself had been prosperous enough to survive without them. They were a buffer nation, though, directly between Land of Fire and Land of Lightning and things were probably about to get very rocky for them.</p><p>But on the road to the town, I paused.</p><p>"Something up?" Aoba asked, quietly. He turned, facing me so we were covering opposite directions.</p><p>I hesitated. "I'm not sure," I said, reluctantly. My chakra sense was <em> reliable </em> but it was hard to put into words things that didn't have direct cause. I just <em> felt</em> them. "I sense… it's nothing concrete. The chakra around the town is a little weird. That happens sometimes," I hurried on. "It could be a natural thing. Caused by the hot springs, maybe? It's kind of… heavy. Muggy."</p><p>"You sure you're not talking about the temperature?" He asked, jokingly.</p><p>I nodded, taking the question seriously. "They could be related – Land of Snow was." I shrugged. "It could be nothing. Sometimes it just happens like that. 'Weird chakra' has only been mission relevant for me once." I tried to lightning the mood, then had to reconsider. Land of Snow had turned out to be mission relevant at the end, with the generator. "Well, twice." And the monks at the Fire Temple- "Okay, three times."</p><p>"Okay," Aoba said. "Weird chakra things. Noted. We'll keep our eyes open."</p><p>"Yeah," I exhaled. "Let's do that."</p><p>And we were only just slightly north of Land of Fire, but the difference in temperature was astonishing. I was fanning myself with my hand as we wandered in to find a hotel and my clothes were sticking to me in totally unpleasant ways. Part of it was that I wasn't able to temperature regulate with chakra like I would have if I wasn't playing at being civilian, but it was just so damn humid.</p><p>"And you can grab towels for the house hot springs at the front desk any time!" the nice older lady running the place said to us. "They're lovely to unwind in at the end of a long day travelling."</p><p>"Sounds perfect," Aoba told her, and he nudged me with his elbow as we went down the hallways to our room. "We should totally investigate that. Who knows what kinds of secrets are hiding in the water."</p><p>I gave him a look that tried to be scandalised but was mostly just amused. "Are you implying we took a trip to the Land of Hot Springs for the purpose of <em> visiting the hot springs</em> ?"</p><p>He grinned. "I'm just saying, we have to seize the opportunities that are presented to us."</p><p>We did anyway, after getting something to eat because everything was shut. For a tourist town, it was dead quiet.</p><p>"Relaxing," Aoba noted, sliding into the water. He was still wearing his sunglasses, the nerd.</p><p>It was, but I wasn't going to tell him that. "Boring," I sighed, leaning back against the rocks and watching the steam rising into the air. "You'd think there'd be a little bit of nightlife."</p><p>"What a wild party animal you are," he deadpanned. "Oh wait, where was it you wanted to go? The library?"</p><p>I yawned and flicked water at him, half-heartedly. "Shuddup."</p><p>The hot springs rocks were clearly sized for people who were taller than me, because I kept sliding down them into the water. The third time I ended up with water up my nose and being laughed at for it, I was done.</p><p>"Alright, I'm out," I declared, hauling myself out of the water and padding back to the changing rooms. The hotel host was in there, changing soaps and cleaning up, and I gave her a sleepy smile as I went past.</p><p>I got changed and started to use the towel to dry out my hair and stood-</p><p>And immediately the world went white around me, bright, too bright, fuzzing around the edges, and I was too too hot and my blood was pounding beneath my skin –</p><p><em> Attack?</em></p><p>My chakra surged, even as my knees buckled and I hit the ground with a clatter, knocking against one of the bathroom stands.</p><p>But there was nothing. My chakra was fine. It pulsed through my body chasing away the strange moment of weakness. I even tried to discretely check for poison, but came up negative.</p><p>"Are you alright dear?" the host asked me, clearly concerned. She hurried over, hands reaching for me.</p><p>I gave her a weak smile. "Just stood up too fast," I said awkwardly.</p><p>She nodded in understanding. "It's the heat," she said, and guided me to a stool. "You just sit there, I'll get you a glass of water!"</p><p>She hurried away.</p><p>"Shikako?" Aoba called, warily from outside. I had no doubt he was prepared to spring into action. "What happened?"</p><p>"I'm fine, niisan!" I called back, hoping the reference to our cover would convince him I was telling the truth and not lying under duress. Now what to say… 'I tripped' would probably just put the alarm meter right up. "I was practicing some new dance moves!"</p><p>"Brothers worry, don't they?" The host said, handing me the promised glass of water. "Now, you drink that right up! It's so humid you don't really notice it, but people get dehydrated very fast around here!"</p><p>Was that really what it was? I was so used to my ninja body being a finely tuned weapon, bursting with so much chakra that things like 'standing up too fast' and 'not enough water' didn't really affect it at all. Not in such minuscule amounts, anyway.</p><p>"Ah, so embarrassing," I said, playing it up, just a fraction. It <em> was</em> embarrassing, but my natural reaction would have been to pretend it had never happened. "Thank you, Oba-san."</p><p>There was a distant ringing noise, like the striking of a bell.</p><p>"What's that?" I asked, even though I could have guessed.</p><p>"The monks!" She replied, brightly. "They do some kind of prayer service that ends with ringing the city bells. It used to be quite terrible – they'd ring them at midnight! Can you imagine? But people kept complaining so they got earlier and earlier and now they ring them at dusk. And at dawn in the morning."</p><p>"Ah, my brother is going to go see them tomorrow!" I said. "It sounds really boring."</p><p>She laughed. "Maybe if you're young. You'll see them anyway, if you're in town. They march through the streets a couple of times a day. For prayers, they say, but it's mostly to collect donations."</p><p>"Ah," I said, finishing my glass of water and swinging my feet. I wondered if there was an easy way out of this conversation now.</p><p>"Is your brother the spiritual type?" she asked, curiously.</p><p>"Oh, no," I said, easily sliding into the cover we'd worked out. "He's a book writer! We're looking for ghost stories!"</p><p>"Ghosts!" she feigned shock. "How scary!"</p><p>I nodded, eagerly, trying to portray nothing but a harmless teenager. "We were in Bird Country before! Did you know, the prince died because his advisor betrayed him and then his ghost came back to seek vengeance!" I paused. "Or that's what they said."</p><p>It wasn't like many people knew the real story anyway. It sounded good, and that was the point.</p><p>"Well, I don't know anything like that," she said, clearly thinking about it. "Yugakure has been so peaceful for a long time! Maybe Old Yama will – he used to work with the ninja, when they lived here. If there's anything that sounds like ghost stories, it's ninja!"</p><p>I beamed at her. Perfect. "Just what I wanted to hear! Thanks, Oba-san!"</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning, the sound of bells woke me.</p><p>"Ugh," I muttered, dragging myself upright and nearly tripping on the tangled bedcovers. "Make it stop."</p><p>Aoba groaned and threw his forearm over his eyes, not even trying to get up. "I haven't slept this badly," he rasped, "since… I don't even know. A long time."</p><p>I staggered to the bathroom and tried to drown my face in the sink. The cold water worked briefly to wake me up, but it only made me aware of how unpleasant I was actually feeling. My nightclothes were sticky with sweat. My hair was frizzy. I'd somehow managed to pull a muscle right between my shoulders.</p><p>"Ow," I said, pitifully, completely unable to reach it and make it feel better.</p><p>The first two problems I took care of, with a quick, cold shower and securing my hair in a braid. The pulled muscle, unfortunately, didn't go so quickly. I traded off the bathroom and started trying to stretch, hoping to loosen it enough to not be painful.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Aoba asked, bemused, once he was done getting ready. He stretched too, and I heard his shoulders click.</p><p>"Ow," I repeated, just as pitiful the second time. "I pulled a muscle. Right on my spine."</p><p>"I'm not a medic nin," he said, "but I'm pretty sure the spine isn't made of muscle." But he stepped behind me and started pressing down, hands deft and sure. There was chakra in his hands and it started to sink into my back, easing it up.</p><p>"That's better, thanks," I said, sighing.</p><p>He snorted. "At this rate, we won't have to worry about Cloud ninja. This place'll kill us."</p><p>"Changed your mind about it being the perfect vacation spot, huh?"</p><p>We split up, Aoba going towards the temple to see if the monks had kept any records of the ninja here and I went towards the library to see if they had any old newspapers on record – or any records of the ninja from the village at all. I was pretty sure Hidan had been from around here, and I was pretty sure that that would have involved murders, so I was hoping there was some kind of trail.</p><p>I saw the monks that I'd been warned about, a group of them moving through the streets and chanting. They even had music to accompany their chanting, some tapping staves to the ground, others carrying small drums. But most interesting to me was the path of chakra that travelled along, stamping the same purpose into the earth day by day until it left a mark behind. I could have followed their circuit around the village with my eyes closed.</p><p>Still. That wasn't why I was here. Chakra based mysteries could wait until after I had information.</p><p>At the library, the librarian showed me to the microfiche and newspaper stashes and even suggested a few years to check out in response to my 'ghost stories' prompt.</p><p>There was even a cat sleeping on a nearby chair that I went to pat.</p><p>"Aw," I said, hand freezing in the air. I looked for the librarian.</p><p>She misunderstood my look. "He's very friendly; you can pat him."</p><p>"No, um," I said awkwardly. <em> Poor kitty.</em> There was definitely no movement of his sides as he breathed. As in, he was definitely not breathing. "I don't think he's very well?"</p><p>"Oh, Chibi," she sighed and came closer to lay a hand on his head. "You missed Mimi that bad, huh?"</p><p>She scooped him up and took him away and I scuttled back to the microfiche and tried to look very, very busy.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I met up with Aoba for dinner. We picked up something to eat at a food cart and found ourselves a very quiet spot to catch up.</p><p>"Does this symbol mean anything to you?" he asked, wiping his hands and pulling out a square of paper with a hastily drawn triangle-in-a-circle on it.</p><p>"Yeah," I said, then repeated it again, more sure. "Yeah. That's the cult symbol."</p><p>He tucked the paper back away again. "I thought so. I found a few places marked with it – I'm going to go and check them out."</p><p>"Okay," I said. "I'm going to try and talk to the people that the lady at the hotel mentioned. Maybe some of them will remember the ninja that used to live here."</p><p>"I'll meet up with you back at the hotel," he agreed. "Maybe we can investigate the hot springs again, eh?"</p><p>We split up. The temperature was getting a little more comfortable now that the sun was going down, but it was still so damned <em> oppressive.</em> And I was a person that was far more comfortable with heat than cold at that.</p><p>I passed a monk sitting with a donation bowl and threw a few coins in, the same as the other passers-by were doing. Out of curiosity, my feet fell onto the path that the monks had walked around the town. It looped, a full circle, centred perfectly around the Temple.</p><p>There was something… there was something strange about it. It didn't <em> feel</em> like the monks at the Fire Temple, I mused as I walked.</p><p>Obviously, I didn't expect them to feel the exact same. They were different people in different places following different spiritual paths…</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Maybe it was just that this one made me feel uneasy?</p><p>The chakra of the Fire Temple had been patient. The kind of patience that came from an unhurried life, where every day brought more of the same. Constant. Ceaseless.</p><p>This was. Something else.</p><p>Patience, still, but a more watchful kind, maybe? The feeling of <em> waiting for</em> something. Of anticipation.</p><p>I finished the circle and branched off inwards, choosing one of the two paths that intersected with the rim of the circle in a 'v', another street through the town that they had filled with fading echoes of their will.</p><p>I could hear the chanting of the monks, starting to rise now as they began evening prayers.</p><p>I stopped.</p><p>I was walking in a straight line.</p><p>The circle had had three points where this path had crossed it, each a 'v' leading in two directions. If I overlaid those two facts in my head-</p><p><em> A circle with a triangle inside. The symbol of Jashin.</em></p><p>Oh goddammit. They'd been hiding in plain sight. The monks <em> were</em> the cultists.</p><p><em> There's a hell of a lot of them,</em> I thought, a little uneasily. But they could hardly all be as dangerous as Hidan. Most likely very few of them had any power at all. And they had no reason to know we were here, or that we were ninja.</p><p>Apart from us nosing around potentially looking for a cult of Jashin.</p><p>I would just… wait for Aoba to come back and we would make a new plan. Simple. No problem.</p><p>From my left, just into the woods outside the town, there was a burst of screaming birds and rustling feathers as a hundred crows tried to take off. Fire sparked and smoked filled the air.</p><p>"Shit," I said, clearly and distinctly. "Great timing, Aoba."</p><p>I spun, ready to leap off and get involved in whatever fight was going on –</p><p>And the world went out from underneath me.</p><p>My legs buckled and my palms hit the concrete with an awkward smack as I failed to compensate for the unexpected weakness. The world seemed bright and fuzzy and I couldn't get enough air.</p><p>I watched as, across the street, two children playing catch both faltered and swayed and went down. Their ball bounced away, rolling past me and down the road.</p><p>"Oh," I breathed, and forced myself up onto hands and knees. It took so much <em> effort</em> – to think, then to act, like every decision was suddenly an insurmountable task, a Sisyphean calculation before I could move – even though my pure and visceral reaction told me what I wanted to do.</p><p>"You <em> fuckers.</em> "</p><p>There was nothing wrong with my chakra, was the thing. It was untouched and responded to my call. But even with it, every movement felt like I was trying to lift the world, like I was fighting a vortex at my back, like every step was worth a hundred miles.</p><p>The kids were breathing, when I reached them. Slowly and shallowly, but they were breathing. Their skin was cold and clammy, and their pupils were blown wide open when I peeled their eyelids back to check, and they wouldn't wake.</p><p>My chakra was fine. Whatever they were pulling from us, it wasn't chakra.</p><p>And that <em> really</em> wasn't as reassuring as it could have been.</p><p>I couldn't sense anything. Not chakra, not physical energy, not spiritual energy. That didn't leave a whole hell of a lot.</p><p>Not unless they were, in some way, pulling pure and unadulterated <em> life energy</em> out of us. And that was…</p><p>I didn't even know what that was. 'Life Energy' was such an obscure topic that I'd never found any information on it that wasn't clearly referencing chakra instead. The only reason I even considered it to be a real thing and not needless spiritualism was because I remembered Chiyo's reanimation technique. I thought it was some kind of more <em> fundamental </em> energy, some kind of combination of soul and body that became <em> life</em> but that-</p><p>That didn't help me now.</p><p>Whatever it was. <em> Something</em> was making me weak, physically sapping my energy and mentally sapping my willpower and concentration. Something I couldn't identify or counteract.</p><p>I didn't want to abandon the kids, but if this was affecting the whole <em> area</em> then I couldn't rescue everyone inside it. I needed to get out and regroup.</p><p>I just had to… get up, first.</p><p>Overhead, the city bells started to ring.</p><p>The sound reverberated, deeper than could be physically possible, rattling the <em> air</em> until it seemed to strike something deep inside. Not inside me. Inside <em> the world</em> . Some vital, unknowable aspect of the fabric of reality, so base that it was never considered.</p><p>The second peal of the bell stripped it away.</p><p>Like a layer of gauze I had never known was there. Like a new colour had been revealed to me. Like the world had gone thin and transparent.</p><p>Like a barrier that had protected us had been lifted.</p><p>And I saw beyond it.</p><p>This oppressive cloud of chakra, hovering around this town, it wasn't natural. It wasn't heat. It wasn't even some dastardly ritual the cultists were doing.</p><p>There was something out there.</p><p>And it wanted <em> in.</em></p><p>I was on my feet, fear overriding the paralysis, panic putting motion back into my muscles. I fled. There was nowhere I could look that I couldn't see it, pressing up against the world, like a-</p><p>Like-</p><p>I had to get <em> out</em> . I had to get to Aoba and we had to <em> leave.</em></p><p>But I hit the line of the circle – the one that the cultists had walked around the city every day for <em> years</em> until it was strong enough to do this – and couldn't pass it. It wasn't a barrier, not how I knew them, but the energy in it <em> burned</em> . My arm went numb when it hit, the chakra system as blocked as if a Hyuuga had done it but more frightening because I couldn't even <em> feel</em> it any longer.</p><p>It might as well have not been there.</p><p>And then there was a monk. A Jashinist.</p><p>The very same one I had given coin to, only hours ago.</p><p>The terror, blind and overwhelming, found a human target and transmuted into something I could act upon; I was suddenly <em> furious</em> . How dare they? How dare they do this? How dare they lie in wait? How dare they bring this shadow of evil into the world?</p><p>I yanked my lightsabre out of hammerspace and sent a wave of lightning towards him, blinding and bright.</p><p>The bell rang a third time and my lightning froze, hanging in mid-air like a beautiful sculpture, still lightning, a contradiction of itself. The world around us warped without moving, the angles seeming <em> wrong,</em> a nightmare place, a dream turned bad. The sun jerked in the sky, leaping forward and back and hovering in multiple places at once.</p><p>"Under the power of Jashin, time and space come undone!" The Jashinist shouted, exultant. His face seemed to glow with triumph. He opened his mouth, wide and wider than a human mouth should have ever gone, a gaping maw to swallow the world and something <em> horrible</em> came out.</p><p>The Thing That Was Out There reached through him. It spilt into the air. It was an oil slick, if you removed all the ways that oil was natural. It was poison, if you removed the ways poison was unwitting. It was pain without cause. It was suffering without respite. It was death without life.</p><p>It was. It knew. It did.</p><p>I froze, transfixed with horror beyond that of anything I'd ever felt before. I had no words for what I was seeing. Nothing beyond the instant, horrible comprehension of what it was.</p><p><em> Jashin.</em></p><p>I opened my mouth and started to scream.</p><p>The sound jolted me out of my trance, woke me enough to fumble back to reality. I put my lightsabre away, threw kunai with exploding notes as a distraction. One went off, one didn't, the lightning surged forward a foot and stopped. Unequal, uneven. Unreal.</p><p>I fled backwards, struggling to find footing that changed even as I moved. Stone crumbled underfoot, reality unmade in fits and starts. Upwards, downwards, a foot, a mile, flat or right angles – it changed, it changed and it was <em> wrong.</em></p><p>My heart beat pounded in my ears. My chest was tight. I couldn't breathe.</p><p>I didn't know what was going on.</p><p>I couldn't think of any way out of this.</p><p><em> Get out of the circle. Get away from this. Run.</em></p><p>I raised my hand to my chest, gripped my necklace through my shirt. Maybe. Maybe. Even if it didn't work, numbness and fire were less horrifying than what waited behind me. Around me. Everywhere.</p><p>I pushed chakra into the stone and changed.</p><p>Around me, reality warped. It <em> reset.</em> It restored itself. I sang with the song of Gelel; the collection of natural energy that <em> was</em> this world, that belonged here, that was grown of this place and by it.</p><p>I was real.</p><p>But so, so small.</p><p>I had a sliver of stone made with a fragment of a god and the last beat of a human heart.</p><p>And that wasn't enough to make it right.</p><p>And - as I dove across the circle of the Jashinist seal - It <em> saw me.</em></p><p>It LoOke<em> d </em> Up<strong> o</strong> n <em> Me. </em></p><p>I stumbled away, human again and so empty, the world unmaking itself under my feet once again. But the forest was so close.</p><p>I just had to get to the forest.</p><p>I was nearly there. I was so close.</p><p>And three figures emerged out of the woods, darkly dressed. One had Aoba slung over his shoulders.</p><p>I threw myself forward.</p><p>And everything went dark.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I drifted, dreamily, back to consciousness.</p><p>If reality had fractured, how did you know what was real? How did you know if you were truly awake, if the nightmare was outside you?</p><p>The Temple seemed real. Or if not real, then solid. Powerful. A towering monolith in a world where nothing was stationary any longer, where time and space were both concepts to toy with, to stretch and discard at whim.</p><p>And it was thick with the smell of blood. Warm and heavy and rich, like we were standing inside a pulsing heart.</p><p>I gagged on it, iron in the back of my throat and painfully squinted my eyes, trying to see the Temple itself and not the spectre of the god hanging over it.</p><p>And wished I hadn't.</p><p>It was real blood. Real blood from real bodies, people, chained to the walls or lying discarded on the floor, split open and bleeding out, bright fresh trails smudging into rusty red covering the floor or sluggishly seeping into the giant etched symbol in the stone.</p><p><em> A circle with a triangle inside. The symbol of Jashin.</em></p><p>At the point of the triangle there was an altar. A single man stood there, bare chested and smeared with blood, holding a glittering ceremonial knife and he was so empty, so inverted against the world that Jashin <em> looked through him-</em></p><p>"Is this it?" he asked, voice surprisingly light and breathy. "Put her here!"</p><p>I was moved, limp and ineffectual, to the point of the triangle, next to the alter. The monk dropped to me the ground and locked my hands behind me.</p><p><em> Handcuffs,</em> I thought, ridiculously. <em> How mundane.</em></p><p>"What about the other one?"</p><p>Blood started to soak into my pants immediately, a creeping red tide. I tried not to look up, not to think about where it had come from. Tried not to watch the bodies being kicked away, or more being brought in. Tried not to wonder how many people it took to produce this much blood.</p><p>"He's a ninja, isn't he?" the leader said. "Chain him up."</p><p><em> Fear is the mind killer</em> . I tried to keep breathing, keep myself still and unnoticeable. I had to assess the situation. I had to stay <em> calm.</em> I had to remember everything I'd learnt, everything I'd been taught and experienced.</p><p>I took all that fear (no matter how important and life preserving) and Split it, shoving it deep down inside. I needed to be able to move. Not be paralysed with terror. Took all the horror and got rid of it. Took the panic and buried it.</p><p>Step one, get free.</p><p>I was handcuffed. My hands were behind my back.</p><p>I could do that. I twisted my hands around until they found my hair, and flicked open the clasp that Ino had given me for my birthday. The one with a lock pick hidden inside.</p><p>My hands felt weak and clumsy and I felt exposed, totally on display. It was a wonder that they didn't notice. Didn't see.</p><p>Step two 'get Aoba' and step three 'get out of here' were a little harder to put into motion.</p><p>They strung Aoba up, chains around his ankles and affixed to the ceiling. Exposed, away from walls or weapons, right out in the middle of the room. Not far from me, but reaching him without being attacked by the rest would be…</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>I swallowed. Buried the fear.</p><p>Aoba was starting to stir. I could see his eyes moving, see them start to flutter open.</p><p>(They'd taken his sunglasses. <em> What bastards. </em> He'd have to get new ones.)</p><p>He seemed dazed. He looked around but didn't seem to <em> see.</em> I straightened, a little, dared to move with so many enemies around, just so that I could catch his eye.</p><p>I saw the moment he recognised me.</p><p>I saw the flash of horror. Of despair.</p><p>I saw the collapse of hope into resignation.</p><p><em> No. No. We need to get out of here!</em> He couldn't give in. Couldn't just say that there was nothing we could do. I needed him to-</p><p>And then the leader stepped forward and slit his throat.</p><p>"No!" I protested, shocked.</p><p>They turned to look at me. I'd blown my cover. But I moved, anyway, too late and too desperate and charged forward towards them. Blood slipped underfoot and I was weak and clumsy but focused.</p><p><em> Aoba! Aoba!</em></p><p>He thrashed, eyes wide. His neck-</p><p>(Even if I reached him, even if I had time, could I heal that? Could I?)</p><p>Hands grabbed for me. I snarled. I grabbed it back, slid low and twisted the person over my hip and threw them to the ground, following up by stamping down on their face with all my weight. Bone crunched.</p><p>And the Jashinists-</p><p>-cheered? Like a crowd at a football game. There was a rising atmosphere, the anticipation, the <em> violence.</em></p><p>"Bloodlust! For Jashin-sama! For Jashin-sama!"</p><p>"No!" I howled, but I could see it too, how my actions were only feeding the power in here, the ritual, how the Jashinist was healing already, bone crunching back into place, a euphoric smile on his face.</p><p>The leader blocked my way. He looked amused, entranced – not afraid. I was just… I was just a bug in a net. Nothing.</p><p>I slammed into him. They wanted blood? Fine.</p><p>"<em> Touch. Blast."</em> I couldn't feel my chakra but I had my will. I wouldn't let them stop me.</p><p>It exploded. The scorching heat was close enough to catch me, but I barely felt it. Couldn't let it stop me.</p><p>He fell back, chest a charred mess and I stumbled into Aoba, hands planning a barrier seal that flickered badly into being. It would hold. That was enough.</p><p>But my hands failed to summon a healing jutsu. There was nothing, when I tried to direct my chakra.</p><p><em> Chakra. Chakra. Please!</em></p><p>It wasn't working. It wasn't working.</p><p>Panic threatened to consume me. He was gurgling. Not breathing. He was dying by slow inches. I had to do something. There had to be something I could do. My hands were red. Caked in it.</p><p>A sound.</p><p>I turned my head. Watched the leader rise, charred but whole. He was still smirking, still amused. He grabbed a staff from another cultist and slammed it once, twice, three times into my barrier.</p><p>It broke.</p><p>"To be a priest of Jashin is to know death!" he declared. He spun the staff. I watched it twirl.</p><p>I couldn't move. Couldn't leave Aoba. Couldn't dodge or flee.</p><p>Could only brace myself and wait.</p><p>He struck. The blunt end slammed into my abdomen, and for a brief moment, it was just pure crushing force, the impact sending waves of pain rattling across my body. Then further, it burst skin, pushing in and in and <em> through</em> until I was impaled on it.</p><p>I gasped, hotcoldhotcold with pain. I blacked out. I swam in it.</p><p>And-</p><p><em> hello little god,</em> it whispered, echoed, transmitted with the pain that I couldn't escape. I could feel it now, feel the way my suffering was giving it strength, feel the way it was slowly, slowly snuffing out Aoba's life.</p><p>This wasn't the Shinigami. The Shinigami killed because it <em> was</em> death, the inevitable entropy to which all things descended. It was impersonal as a fact. It just <em> was.</em></p><p>This was not like that. This was hatred and bloodlust and spite and pain, all condensed into one being. It was the <em> idea</em> of them, greater than the things themselves, spread between people, saturating the air.</p><p>I trembled. "Go… to… hell."</p><p>The cultists dragged me to the altar, holding me upright because I couldn't stand. The pain was intolerable but I couldn't pass out again. <em> Wanted to</em> but couldn't. I was connected to it, now, part of this terrible and awful ritual.</p><p>The leader took the goblet from the altar and held it beneath Aoba, collecting the last rivulets of blood.</p><p>(I watched the light fade from his eyes.)</p><p>"To Jashin-sama!" He declared and held it high. "To the last sacrifice for the new world!"</p><p>He dipped his fingers into the blood and painted the symbol of Jashin on my forehead. I jerked my head out of the way, thrashed and spat at them, no matter how much it pained me, but they held me in place.</p><p>It burnt cold. I felt it seep into my brain. Saw more than mortal eyes were ever, ever meant to.</p><p>I buried everything into the black.</p><p><em> your death will open the gate</em> , Jashin whispered and delighted in the horror and pain that that caused in me. No matter how far back I pulled, I couldn't get away from it.</p><p>There were fingers, prying my mouth open, and I discovered that there was still horror in me, after all.</p><p>"No," I moaned. "No."</p><p>He tipped the cup.</p><p>I gagged on it, bile rising in my throat. It filled my mouth, out of it, down my chin and neck and front. Smeared across my cheeks.</p><p>Jashin roared in triumph, echoing in my head and bones. It was pain. I was pain. There was nothing in this whole universe but pain.</p><p><em> all of this is mine and i will destroy it</em></p><p>But there was-</p><p>There was so much in this world that I loved. That I didn't want destroyed.</p><p>I found the will to raise my head. "No."</p><p>They weren't looking at me. They felt the closeness of their god. They were only inches from success, from the realisation of the horrible thing that they wanted.</p><p>They didn't know-</p><p>I had been here before. I had knelt, bleeding and dying, before the coming of a god. Gelel had been life, and I had <em> let it</em> <em> in</em> but there had been another option. There had been a way, a plan, a seal.</p><p>Chakra didn't work here, now. But my seals still did. In this place of gods, <em> willpower</em> still counted.</p><p>And I knew that seal. The instructions were right here with me, sealed into my flesh.</p><p>All I had to do was set it.</p><p>It would kill me, but … I was going to die here, either way. There was no way out. I had nothing. No chance, no choice, no hope.</p><p>Only me.</p><p>"No," I repeated, voice just a whisper. But certain. "This place is not yours." My eyes started to fill with tears, welling up so very easily.</p><p>"Oh, it is," the leader assured me. He picked up his knife. "This is just the last step."</p><p>My first tear fell and hit the ground like a tombstone slamming into place. Black ink blossomed from where it hit, spreading out and out and out like a creeping infection.</p><p>"Your problem," I whispered. "Is that you think the greatest power lies in blood."</p><p>Blood carried chakra, was necessary for life. It <em> was</em> powerful. And it was stable which was why we used it for seals. But tears – that carried everything life was <em> about.</em> And I was banking on that being <em> more</em> , being enough to highjack this ritual, to overwrite it, to fuel my seal instead.</p><p>The other tears that fell were useless, desperate things, calling for home and family but I couldn't stop them. They just fell.</p><p>My seal pulsed with energy. The centre of the room started to collapse inwards, a single black point that would swallow us all whole.</p><p>"No!" The leader screamed even as Jashin howled in my head in impotent rage. He thrust his staff down into the ink on the floor, their combined will meeting mine in a furious titanic clash.</p><p>I feel backwards, into darkness, to protect myself.</p><p>And the seal-</p><p>-broke.</p><p>The power, gathered but no longer contained, controlled, did what a broken failure of a seal always did.</p><p>It exploded.</p><p>I watched it, numbly, in the flicker frames of still time, my last moments stretching into a bizarre infinity; the black ink of the seal turning sheer white, the stone cracking apart with the force of it, the air turning hazy and hot.</p><p>And then-</p><p>Something inside yanked and tore me away.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Hot Springs Arc: Chapter 130</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 130</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> I have looked upon all the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me ~ H.P. Lovecraft</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>I was pulled, away and through, out of the nightmare zone of the Jashinist Temple, so close to the explosion that its glittering lights were painted on the back of my eyelids like tiny stars blooming into being.</p><p>And then there was nothing, just quiet and stillness and me, all alone in my head, and the only other thing in all of existence was the thin thread that pulled me through it.</p><p>After the overwhelming oppression of the Temple, the lack of anything was too much.</p><p>And then I was dragged out of it, that temporary crossing place, and slammed into a world not my own. I hit grass and cried out in pain.</p><p>Grass. Dirt. Sky. Fog. Trees. My head spun with disorientation, unable to make a picture of it. There was chakra around me, I could feel it, natural energy stronger and more potent than anything I'd felt before.</p><p>But it was calm. It was <em> pleasant</em> . It felt familiar. Like a home I'd never seen before.</p><p>"Summoner!" Heijomaru called, worried, dropping his face down to nudge mine. It left a smear of blood across his cheek.</p><p>I turned to the side, barely upright on a single elbow and retched. Blood and bile and once I started I couldn't stop, throwing up everything possible and then continuing to dry heave. My torso screamed with pain at every movement, and black spots were creeping over the edges of my vision – where it wasn't burning white.</p><p>There were more deer clustered around me now - Gemmei, Kanmu and Shotoku – and there was panic building in the herd. The ground was shaking from stamping feet, as they moved about in agitation.</p><p>"She is gravely injured," Shotoku said, sharply. "We need to work quickly."</p><p>(How were they going to heal me? I thought, strangely bewildered. They didn't have any thumbs.)</p><p>And I felt… so tired. Numb and empty and horror filled and if I just… just lay my head down for a while and went to sleep…</p><p>But-</p><p>I'd been rescued. I'd been given a chance to survive. I'd been so sure I was going to die, and now I had a chance.</p><p>I had to take it.</p><p>Slowly, I lifted my hand. Pawed at my neck until I pulled my necklace free. My fingers were unsteady, shaking with pain and exhaustion and were so slow and clumsy. But I pulled free the tiny shard of Gelel.</p><p>I nearly dropped it, and nearly wept at the failure. If I dropped it, I doubted I would be able to find it again, would have the will to search and pick it up. It was too small and I was too weak.</p><p>I cradled it carefully and slid my hand down to my abdomen, to the gaping wound there. And then I shoved the Gelel stone inside.</p><p>Then, thankfully, I passed the fuck out.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Awaken, Summoner!" Heijomaru's gravely voice rumbled next to my face.</p><p>I groaned and dragged myself back to consciousness and – oh, sweet, blissful chakra. I grabbed at it greedily, with more relief than I wanted to really examine. I had been so pathetically helpless and terrified without it.</p><p>"'jomaru?" I rasped, managing to squint my eyes open. It wasn't bright, some kind of full moon or pre-dawn light and the air was cool and damp on my skin.</p><p>"You must eat to recover," he said nudging me. "You are very weak."</p><p>He was right. Even now my chakra was returning, maybe especially now, I could tell how badly off I was.</p><p>I murmured an acknowledgement and tried to take stock of my situation. My stomach had been packed with moss and some kind of paste (<em> no really, they don't have any hands, how?</em> ) but beneath that the skin was tender but healed.</p><p>The Gelel stone had worked. I let out a shaky breath. It was still in there, but that was a problem I could solve later. Since it wasn't in my main chakra gate this time, hopefully it wouldn't ruin my ability to use chakra the same way it had before.</p><p>I tested that, using chakra to coat the inside of my mouth and stripping it away, pulling bloody saliva-and-mucus <em> gunk </em> out and throwing it to the ground with a wet splat. My mouth immediately flooded itself with saliva again, but it was fresh and uncontaminated with-</p><p>"Fuck," I whimpered, curling in on myself.</p><p>"Summoner?" Heijomaru repeated, shifting his weight almost nervously, grass rustling against his hooves.</p><p>I pulled myself into a sitting position. "Yeah," I whispered dryly. "I know."</p><p>I dragged my canteen out of hammerspace and dumped a sachet of re-hydrating powder into it, and fumbled my med-kit free for basically anything I thought would help. The deer had provided fruit for me and I ate them blankly, almost staring into space.</p><p>I felt so <em> tired.</em> Something deeply internal. Something <em> not right.</em></p><p>"How did you…" I started to ask, leaning listlessly against the support of Heijomaru.</p><p>"Though it was not part of our agreement," Heijomaru acknowledged, "the ability to summon goes both ways. As you can draw us to your world, so we can draw you into ours. It is not an invitation that we extend often, or lightly."</p><p>I knew that much. Both that it could be done, and that the deer didn't like to do so. They'd never given reasons why and I'd never pushed for them but, staring down at the blood-stained grass around me, I could guess.</p><p>I was contaminating it.</p><p>"But how did you know?" I asked, eyes sliding shut even against my will.</p><p>"You called for us," Heijomaru said, after a moment of silence. "For home and for family and for rescue. Our blood rang with it and the river ran with the echoes. And yet, you did not summon us. It was… concerning."</p><p>My tears. When I had tried to use them to shape the world, to force my will over that of a god, when I had gambled with things I had never done before … I had cried. And I had wanted.</p><p>And apparently, people had heard.</p><p>"Thank you," I managed to say. There was something gripping tight around my throat. "Thank you."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The second time I woke, I was curled up in the thick grass, sunken into it so the stems tickled at my skin. It was cold, and fog had rolled in over the fields, but the warm bulk of Heijomaru was curled up behind me, neck arched over me and his head a heavy weight in front of my chest.</p><p>I watched a single blade of grass gather dew until it bent under the weight of a single droplet, curving down towards the earth.</p><p>Somewhere in the trees a bird started to sing.</p><p>I breathed in, deeply, the chill from the air creeping into my lungs from the inside. My chest expanded and Heijomaru's head moved. He woke quickly, eyelids lifting to reveal dark and liquid eyes.</p><p>"Daughter of the Forest," he rumbled, lifting his head. "Do you wake?"</p><p>I considered. Was I awake? Or merely dreaming a peaceful dream? How did you know, when the nightmares existed outside?</p><p>"Yes," I said, hushed. "I am awake."</p><p>The sun was starting to lift over the tree tops. There were mountains, on the horizon, banked in mist and cloud. There was a river, somewhere nearby, burbling cheerfully away.</p><p>Everything about this place was beautiful. In another time and place, I might have cared.</p><p>"Can you…" I asked, hesitantly. "Can you take me home?"</p><p>Heijomaru tucked his feet beneath him and heaved himself to his feet, a wall of muscle moving with purpose, skin shivering to resettle into place. I stood too, the rush of blood as I moved making me feel both too real and unreal all at once.</p><p>"To Konoha? No," he said. "Sembei cannot summon us any longer, so there is no anchor we could use there."</p><p>I blinked, slowly. "Then?"</p><p>"We can … return you," he went on. "Simply by reversing the summons that brought you here."</p><p>"To the same place," I said, just to make sure.</p><p>"Yes," he agreed. "To the very same place that you were rescued from." He went silent. "There are longer paths, from one world to the next, but they are twisting and dangerous and I do not know how to walk them. Or the other summons tied to your village may know a way back, though asking may be a dangerous gamble."</p><p>I nodded, tiredly, and stared at my hands.</p><p><em> Bloodstained.</em></p><p>My seal had broken. It had shattered and exploded. What would be left, if I went back?</p><p>"If," I said, "if I went back… would you come? Would you summon me back if I didn't call?"</p><p>"Yes, Summoner," Heijomaru said gravely, as though we were forging a contract. "If that is your will."</p><p>I ate, even though I wasn't hungry. Drank as much water as I could and took what medicine I thought might help. Then I made a small incision in my side to draw out the Gelel stone and returned it (shining and clean and unbloodied) to my necklace.</p><p>Then I stood as straight as I could and squared my shoulders. "Let's go," I said, lifting my chin.</p><p>I didn't know what I would see-</p><p>I suspected I would see-</p><p>It had-</p><p>The world twisted, I twisted, snapped away and apart and flung back through that dark and empty crossing space, from one world to the next. But I was ready this time, landed on my feet in a crouch, hand and chakra ready to summon-</p><p>My eyes widened.</p><p>I followed through on the summoning, calling Heijomaru to my side, even as I only just began to take in what I was seeing.</p><p>There was nothing there.</p><p>Heijomaru landed, battle ready and armoured, but there were no enemies to fight.</p><p>There was nothing there.</p><p>"It wasn't," I said, turning around and around. "It wasn't supposed-"</p><p>My breath hitched. I was trembling.</p><p>There was <em> nothing there.</em></p><p>"Summoner?" Heijomaru asked. "Where <em> are</em> we?"</p><p>There was nothing but ash.</p><p>All around us, no matter what direction I looked, there was only ash.</p><p><em> My seal</em> , I thought, numbly. A black hole to seal away a god. That took power. I had hijacked a ritual to summon a god – that was power. How many people had they killed? How much energy was there in one human life? In ten, in twenty, in a hundred?</p><p>What happened, when you turned that into an explosion?</p><p>"It wasn't-"</p><p><em> I am become death, destroyer of worlds</em></p><p>As far as I could see, in any direction. How far? How far did it go? The town, gone. The outlying farms, gone. How far beyond that? How far?</p><p>How many people-</p><p>I swallowed, mouth dry. The old lady at the hotel. The kids I'd wanted to save. The librarian with the cat. The vendors selling food. Everyone I had seen or talked to or who had just existed here, away from me.</p><p>"-moner?!" Heijomaru jostled me, voice deep and spooked.</p><p>I curled my hand into the straps on his amour. It left a deep smear of blood. Blood that should have been dry by now.</p><p><em> Out, out, damned spot</em> . <em> What will these hands ne'er be clean?</em></p><p>"Home," I said, voice small and quiet. "Please, Heijomaru."</p><p>He knelt down so I could slide, awkward and ungainly, onto his back. Every movement we made stirred the ash beneath our feet, sending little puffs into the air, black and white dancing on the breeze. It had crept up over my shoes and dusted to my legs, undeniable evidence of what had happened.</p><p>Heijomaru started to move, his hooves kicking up ash, each stride eating up ground. But it was nothing, nothing, everything the same, like we were trapped in an endless landscape. My hair whipped out around me, tossed free and stinging my face but the sensation was too faint to keep my attention.</p><p>I was shaking.</p><p>"Heijomaru?" I murmured, confused. Something wasn't right. Something wasn't right.</p><p>My mind felt sluggish. Slow.</p><p>"Rest, Summoner," he said. "I will return you home."</p><p>Everything around us was ash.</p><p><em> Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.</em></p><p>I closed my eyes and let myself be darkness.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Heijomaru ran on. The ash gave away to rubble, eventually. There were metal beams and concrete walls, half standing. Things not totally destroyed in the initial explosion. There were fires still burning.</p><p>And there were bodies.</p><p>Heijomaru ran on.</p><p>Heijomaru ran on, until the destruction stopped being so total. Until there were people, alive and moving and screaming and weeping. Until there were shinobi, Konoha shinobi, sifting through the wreckage and pulling them free, giving help and aid where they could and respect where they couldn't.</p><p>There were lines, and lines, and lines, of still forms under white sheets.</p><p>They raised a shout at the sight of us, the message passed down the line, and told us to halt. Ninja, freeing themselves up in preparation for attack, ready to defend themselves and others.</p><p>Heijomaru pranced in place, tossing his head. "My summoner is one of your people, Leaf Clan. Call your leader!"</p><p>It was a wary standoff, broken by the body flicker arrival of two more ninja, stronger and higher ranked. One was the leader of the border station, the one that had given Aoba and I permission to cross only days before. The other was-</p><p>"Shikako?" Dad said, quiet horror on his face. He reached for me, tugged me down off of my summons and I tumbled, ragdoll, into his arms.</p><p>"Get a medic," the other Jounin ordered tersely.</p><p>I breathed, steady, steady.</p><p>Dad slapped my face, lightly, then harder when he received no response.</p><p>He checked my pulse. His chakra wove and tangled with mine and the quiet horror on his face deepened.</p><p>"We have healed her," Heijomaru declared. "But her spirit sickens."</p><p>"What <em> happened?</em> " Dad snapped, uncharacteristic.</p><p>Heijomaru tossed his head, unimpressed with the tone, unimpressed with being ordered around, just unimpressed in general.</p><p>The medic arrived, a tired, drawn young lady, who examined me and shook her head. "There isn't much wrong with her. Minor cuts and bruising. As far as triage goes, she doesn't even make the list right now. Excuse me, Jounin Commander."</p><p>She slipped away again.</p><p>"Shikako," Dad said. His chakra pulled on me, tried to lift me up, a familiar, comforting safety blanket trying to wrap itself around me. But I was in too far, too deep for him to reach.</p><p>"Sir?" the other Jounin asked.</p><p>Dad gritted his teeth, muscle in his jaw pulsing briefly, and face going blank. "She may have information on what happened here," he said, shortly. "But we don't have the resources to try and heal her. Heijomaru, are you able to return her to Konoha?"</p><p>"I will," Heijomaru said.</p><p>Dad nodded. "Chuuyou will escort you back. Make haste."</p><p><hr /></p><p>AN: So you guys like Shikako and explosions, right?</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Hot Springs Arc: Chapter 131</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: FYI, demanding updates is <em> always</em> rude. Demanding to know why it's 'taking so long' when it has been less than two weeks since the last one is <strong> incredibly</strong> rude and most likely to make an author too annoyed to do more writing.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 131</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Nobody knows how to get back home</em></p><p><em> And we set out so long ago</em></p><p><em> Search the heavens and the Earth below</em></p><p><em> Nobody knows how to get back home</em></p><p><em> ~ The Lumineers, Nobody Knows</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"<em> Report</em> ."</p><p>"<em> Nara. Report</em> ."</p><p>A sigh. A burst of green light. Warm hands. The smells of the hospital; disinfectant, soap, linen.</p><p>No pain. No blood.</p><p>No ash.</p><p>"<em> Shikako,</em> " Tsunade's voice, again. Softer. Kinder. "<em> I need you to tell me what happened.</em> "</p><p>I shuddered. From the very centre of self, a tremor shaking things loose.</p><p>I had to tell her.</p><p>I had to tell her what had happened.</p><p>That was my duty, as a ninja. To give and give and give and rise every time something was asked of me.</p><p>But.</p><p>I was… so <em> tired</em> . Hadn't I done enough?</p><p><em> Look at what you've wrought. Look at what you've caused. Haven't you done </em> <em> <strong> enough</strong> </em> <em> ?</em></p><p>I breathed. In. Out. Steady. Breathing was an autonomic reflex. Unconscious. Automatic. Irrepressible, even – you couldn't just stop. It was a thing that just happened, whether you thought about it or not. In and out.</p><p>The body wanted to live. Beneath everything, there was that. One breath at a time.</p><p>Tsunade sighed again as the silence stretched out. She strode towards the door, heels clicking on the floor and opened it, letting people flood in. Shikamaru. Inoichi. Kasuga.</p><p>"Shikako!" Shikamaru darted towards the bed, clung to my hand.</p><p>I breathed.</p><p>"What's wrong with her?" he asked.</p><p>Tsunade levelled a bland look at him. "That's my question," she said, addressing both him and Kasuga. "Shikaku sent a very brief message that seemed to imply the Nara clan is the expert on… this."</p><p>"Dad said?" Shikamaru echoed, and frowned. "Dad's at the border. Why was she…?"</p><p>Tsunade's lips thinned. "She was on a classified mission in the Land of Rice Fields and turned up at the border, unresponsive. Your father sent her home for treatment. So. Can it be treated?"</p><p>"But-" Shikamaru started.</p><p>Kasuga-oji thumped him in the shins with his walking stick. "You aren't here as her brother, Shikamaru," he said, severely. "You're here as her clan head. Get it together."</p><p>Shikamaru's lips thinned, but he straightened and drew his shoulders back. "Apart from dad, Kasuga-oji is the best person to be able to treat her," he said.</p><p>Kasuga leant his weight on his walking stick. "If Shikaku sent her back rather than treat her himself-"</p><p>Tsunade shook her head. "He didn't have the time or resources," she said shortly. "The situation is bad out there."</p><p>Kasuga accepted that. "Then whether or not I will be able to help her depends largely on one thing," he admitted. "And that's whether she did it on purpose or not."</p><p>Shikamaru's hand tightened on mine. "Why would she do it on purpose?!" he demanded.</p><p>But Tsunade and Kasuga were watching each other, faces ninja-blank.</p><p>"What?" he asked.</p><p>"She brought Yamanaka-sama with her," Kasuga pointed out. "And that means that whatever your sister knows, whatever her mission was… it's worth her being mind-walked for."</p><p>"I brought Inoichi because Shikako wasn't on a solo mission," Tsunade deflected. She looked at Shikamaru, grave and earnest. "We have Konoha shinobi missing in action. Who are in serious danger and require back up. Back up that I have no idea where to send."</p><p>"You want my permission," Shikamaru said, swallowing. "I'm here as her clan head."</p><p>Inoichi put a hand on his shoulder. "You know I won't hurt her," he said, gently. "But time is of the essence and it takes a long time to bring someone back from this."</p><p>Shikamaru nodded jerkily.</p><p><em> No.</em></p><p>I curled in, a dragon in the dark, dragon and darkness both, defended, protected. My treasure was myself. My soft underbelly was covered in scales.</p><p><em> I am fire. I am death.</em></p><p>I <em> ached.</em></p><p>"We should try first," Shikamaru said, the words sticking in his throat. "Just. We should try first." He marshalled himself. "If she <em> did</em> do it on purpose, then she might have left a trigger to undo it."</p><p>"Alright," Tsunade agreed, softly, softly.</p><p>Shikamaru's hands on mine, shadow on mine. But if he was the shadow of the bird that skimmed the surface of the water, then I was the depths of the ocean where light did not reach.</p><p>"Shikako," he said, out loud then not. Shikako, shikakoshikako come back its safe itssafe comeback Shikako<strong> comeback</strong> ! givemebackmysister</p><p>There were no gods for him to fight. No gods. No weapons. No chance, no choice, no hope. Nothing here but me.</p><p>I wanted to sleep.</p><p>I just wanted to <em> sleep</em> .</p><p>Kasuga was nightfall, wrapped around me. A thing to breathe in and blur at the edges, but not enough to draw me out.</p><p>Inoichi reached. His hands were cool. The dragon bared teeth, ready to fight or flee or defend, driven with the singular instinct to protect the self. The darkness waited.</p><p>And he drew back.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Shikamaru asked, worry clear.</p><p>"There are traces of a mental attack," Inoichi said carefully. "A serious one. I'd need the departments protective sealing if I was going to mind walk her. And even then… I'm not certain I wouldn't be doing more damage – either compounding the attack or by tripping whatever defences she tried to raise against it."</p><p>"I see," Tsunade said, grimly. "And you saw nothing?"</p><p>"Nothing," Inoichi confirmed. "<em> Absolutely</em> nothing. Which means I hope that she did do this on purpose and managed to hide from me."</p><p>Shikamaru made a little punched out noise.</p><p>I was <em> so tired.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"I wonder," Kasuga drawled, later.</p><p>Later. Later. It was later. There was no window in this secure room, nothing to say time had passed. But it had. Everyone else had gone. They'd brought him a chair. I remembered being aware, remembered remembering, but everything was a splatter-blur of snapshots, a jigsaw puzzle tipped out of the box. It made a picture, but only if you put it all together.</p><p>"Did you leave a trigger?" Kasuga asked. "Did you do this on purpose? It's too clean to be unwilling, but that doesn't mean it's what you <em> meant</em> to do."</p><p>He waited. I breathed.</p><p>"What would you use? If it was Konoha, then you're here. If it was the Hokage, you've seen her. Your brother. Your father." He hummed, thoughtfully, to himself. "What signifies safety, to you? What means the mission is over and it's time to come home?"</p><p>His chakra was over mine, like nightfall over land. It was tempting, that close comforting darkness. But it was so far away and I was down so deep. I would have had to dig my way up, through layers of dirt and mud, and even the thought of the climb left me exhausted.</p><p>I would have to reach for him.</p><p>I would have to climb.</p><p>I would have to <em> start.</em></p><p>"You aren't sentimental enough to use the baby. No. No, it's not a person at all, is it? Or a place. It'll be words – the simplest trigger of all."</p><p>It was too much.</p><p>I couldn't-</p><p>I couldn't do it.</p><p>Kasuga kept talking but the words drifted over me, fragments of sentences like ocean waves. I detached. Drifted.</p><p>There was a knock on the door. Swift, professional, a warning more than a request.</p><p>Ibiki stepped inside.</p><p>Kasuga narrowed his eyes. His hands tightened on his cane. "That's hardly necessary," he said.</p><p>Ibiki gave him a flat smile, maybe something intended to be reassuring. "I'm just a concerned colleague," he said, "here to ask a few questions."</p><p>"I'm not leaving the room," Kasuga said, flatly.</p><p>I could almost feel the tension in his chakra. The shift of the darkness from warm and comforting to a thing that hid danger inside it.</p><p>Ibiki crouched next to the bed, so that our gazes met. He took my hands in his, my fingers pale and limp against his dark gloves. His grip was firm. Anchoring. "Shikako," he said. "Information is the most important weapon a ninja can have."</p><p>It echoed. <em> There will be times you have to risk your life to get it.</em> Had that been only a year ago? It felt like lifetimes.</p><p>"Your comrades are fighting out there," he went on, implacable. "Don't you want them to have the weapons they need?"</p><p>I shuddered.</p><p><em> Those who abandon their friends are worse than trash.</em> Sensei's words. Konoha's ideals.</p><p>Truth.</p><p>I breathed in, shaky, hitching. No longer smooth automation. My heart was pounding, beats picking up rabbit fast as I <em> tried</em> . I was fighting weights that didn't exist, concrete blocks on every limb sinking me to the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>Every struggle took energy I didn't have.</p><p>One of the monitoring seals started to beep.</p><p>"Your friends need this information," Ibiki repeated. "What happened on that mission?"</p><p>It was too much. The idea, the concept, trying to reduce it all into words, speaking, lungs exhaling, mouth forming shapes, throat vibrating with sound – too many pieces, too many points of failure.</p><p>I couldn't-</p><p>I grasped for the surface, hands clawing out of a grave, a drowning swimmer clutching the open air. I touched Kasuga's darkness, tried to find purchase on it, but he recoiled from me.</p><p>"Stop!" he ordered, sounding almost panicked. "Right now!"</p><p>"What happened to Aoba?" Ibiki asked, anyway. Not cruel. Not kind. Just. Asked.</p><p>Aoba. Aoba.</p><p><em> Those who abandon their friends are worse than trash.</em></p><p>He might need rescuing, Tsunade had said. But he didn't. He didn't.</p><p>I choked on air, couldn't find the words. But this was easy. One simple concept. One idea. One word.</p><p>I lifted my hand. Dragged it through the heavy, molasses air until it was at my throat. Thumb to carotid artery. Dragged it across. The simplest of charades - death.</p><p>The medical seal gave a shrill whistle.</p><p>I breathed out.</p><p>Closed my eyes.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I drifted.</p><p>There were sparks of colour. Green chakra. Foxfire at night. Medical ninjutsu poking and prodding <em> heal</em> and <em> fixthis</em> and <em> whatiswrongwhatisit</em> .</p><p>I slept. I woke. I slept and woke and sleptwokeslept the difference blurring and blurring. The exhaustion stayed, clouded like fog over everything.</p><p>Red eyes. Dark hands. Scrambling in the dark to find me. More chakra. Some familiar, some not. Medics. Questions. Words. Sounds. Noise.</p><p>Time, slipping through my fingers like sand on a beach.</p><p>And then-</p><p>Hands, grabbing my arms. Dragging me to my feet. Rough, hasty.</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>Black cloak. White, bone mask. Anbu. Chakra; Sai.</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>I was in a hospital room. General Ward, not Secure this time. No guards. It was dark – night time, with only the glow of streetlamps through the open window. I was wearing white hospital pyjama's. My hair was loose. My feet were bare.</p><p>Sai dragged me forward, swinging an identical black cloak around my shoulders. "You must come with me," he said, urgently. "You are in danger."</p><p>I wavered, lightheaded. My blood pounded, rush<em> rush</em> of sound in my ears. The mask he gave me only amplified it, enclosed it around me, contained.</p><p><em> Danger.</em></p><p>"Quickly," Sai said. He took my hand and dragged me forward, towards the window. "Shikako. There isn't time."</p><p>I wet my lips. "<em> What</em> ." More croak than word. More sound than shape.</p><p>"There are shinobi coming here," Sai explained, "to take you away."</p><p>I clambered, ungainly, out the window. Sai caught me and body flickered us both to the roof.</p><p>"Danzo," I rasped. What else would Sai know to warn me of? We started moving, roof hopping away from the hospital. I followed Sai blindly, trusting he knew where he was going.</p><p>He made a sound of assent. "I don't know what he intends," he said. "But you should not find out."</p><p>I shuddered, stumbling briefly. Sai's grip on my wrist tightened, ensuring I wouldn't fall.</p><p>I didn't want to find out. Did he know what I'd done? Or did he just guess, or want to find out, or question me himself? And if… if he did…</p><p>He'd want to do it again.</p><p>That I didn't doubt.</p><p>The explosion. The black hole. Would Danzo even stoop to dealing with Jashin? He <em> would</em> consider lives of people to be an acceptable price for power, wouldn't he?</p><p>I couldn't let that happen.</p><p>"I need," I rasped, "to talk to the Hokage."</p><p>Tsunade would-</p><p>I could put Tsunade between us. I'd be safe there. From Danzo, at least.</p><p>Sai nodded, blank mask barely shifting. I plotted our course, realised he had already come to that conclusion – we were headed for the Hokage's residence. If it was so late that Tsunade wasn't at that tower, then we had to go to her home.</p><p>"You'll have to convince them to let you in," he said, as if that was only a small task.</p><p>Well. Tsunade would want to see <em> me</em> . Though I doubted she would have left messages with her guard to that effect, on account of me being insensate in hospital.</p><p>I nodded because I didn't have a choice, and Sai let me go, fading away back into the night, leaving me alone, exposed and horribly helpless.</p><p>I jumped from the roof, landed ungainly on the cold grass, and padded through the gates toward the house. It was a large, imposing building, almost a compound of its own, and I wondered if this had been the Senju residences, back when there had been enough of them to call a clan.</p><p>I could sense the Anbu squad around the walls, long before they made themselves known to stop me.</p><p>But.</p><p>That was Sasuke's chakra.</p><p>Of all the chances. Of all the people in Konoha that could have been on duty here, tonight, it had to be just the one I needed.</p><p>I stared up, focused on the place where he was balanced on the roof, and uncurled one hand from underneath my borrowed coat and slowly paced it through Konoha Standard.</p><p><em> Hokage. Report.</em></p><p>My hand with its scars and poison green nail polish, recognisable, especially to someone with photographic eyes.</p><p>I hoped it was recognisable.</p><p>It must have been. There was a blur, Sasuke materialising down on the ground in front of me and grabbing my wrist in a grip so tight it was almost painful.</p><p>"I'll handle this," he said, out loud.</p><p>Another Anbu faded out of the night, argued briefly with a flurry of handseals. But Sasuke must have won, because I wasn't struck down, and he ushered me in through the door.</p><p>Someone was clearly dispatched to go and wake the Hokage because we waited in the foyer. Tsunade wasn't pleased to be woken up in the middle of the night, but she appeared with a frown and a dressing gown. Her hair wasn't in her customary pigtails and was almost the most surprising thing.</p><p>"Hawk," she said, focusing on Sasuke. "What's the situation?"</p><p>"Hokage-sama," I rasped, slowly. My throat was so dry. "I need to report."</p><p>Her head turned, slowly and deliberately, and took me in. I didn't think that she hadn't <em> seen</em> me, or anything like that, but she was very, very clearly re-evaluating whatever judgement she had made.</p><p>Tsunade took a deep breath and then released it through her nose. "Right," she said, almost to herself. "Come on, then."</p><p>But she took us to the kitchen first, and filled a teapot, getting a tray of cups and biscuits out. "We're definitely going to need this," she muttered.</p><p>Sasuke stepped forward to try and carry it, but she balanced it effortlessly on one hand and swatted him off with the other, herding us both further into the house. It was a nice place but… austere. Like a showpiece.</p><p>"This room has privacy seals like you wouldn't even believe," she said, closing the door behind her.</p><p>I would believe it. I could feel the chakra humming in the walls. And, well, <em> the Hokage's house.</em></p><p>"Sit down," Tsunade directed. "And we'll get started."</p><p>She poured the tea. I sat and took a cup, fumbling briefly with my fake Anbu mask to remove it. Sasuke took a cup and <em> didn't</em> remove his mask, and on a better day his secret Anbu drinking techniques would have been unfairly interesting to me.</p><p>"On the 24th," I started, slowly, voice as measured as I could make it, "Aoba and I departed Konoha via the East Gate."</p><p>The first part was standard for any kind of mission. We'd travelled to the boarder. Encountered no problems on the way. The outpost had told us about the Cloud ninja.</p><p>"We decided to continue with our mission," I said, distantly. "That the potential information gain was worth the increased risk."</p><p>The thing was-</p><p>The thing was, we'd been <em> right.</em> It hadn't been the Cloud ninja. We hadn't fought them. We hadn't even seen them. If they hadn't been there, there would have been no difference to how things turned out at all.</p><p>Or would there have been?</p><p>It did see awfully convenient that a god of pain and misery and bloodlust and people killing each other in awful ways would be summoned while there were two armies gathering only hours away. It did seem awfully convenient that it had happened while there were two ninja in the city.</p><p>Had we strengthened it? How strong was a ninja, compared to a normal person? Enough to matter, even with this?</p><p>"Nara!" Tsunade ordered, sharply.</p><p>I jolted, tea slopping out of my cup and onto my hands. It was hot. I stared at them dumbly, until Sasuke passed me a napkin to wipe it off.</p><p>"I- oh," I said, vaguely. Where had I been up to? I couldn't remember. "On the 24th Aoba and I departed Konoha via the East Gate-"</p><p>Tsunade's face was closed as I reported. A good, solid leader expression, unsurprised by what she was being told. Not judging. Just listening.</p><p>"We investigated the village," I said. "There wasn't- There wasn't much there." I fell silent again, but didn't let myself drift. It was getting harder to focus now, taking so much more effort to put things into words. I didn't know if it was because I was running out of whatever burst of energy that the brief brush with danger had given me, or if it was because I was getting closer to things I didn't want to talk about. "But Aoba. He found the symbol. The monks-"</p><p>There was a knock on the door.</p><p>I stared at it blankly. Even Tsunade seemed nonplussed.</p><p>She seemed to weigh her choices. This report or whatever unknown crisis was happening outside?</p><p>"Put your mask back on and follow me," she decided.</p><p>Sasuke helped me affix the Anbu mask back in place and I stood, mimicking the way that he fell into step slightly behind the Hokage. We followed her out, back to the foyer of the residence and knelt in a ready position when she stopped.</p><p>And that was a good thing, because my knees felt wobbly when I saw who was there. Danzo, flanked by his own blank faced guards.</p><p>"This is a bit late for a social call," Tsunade said, dryly, just half a beat late. "What do you want?"</p><p>"Bad news, Tsunade," Danzo said, though he didn't look particularly perturbed. "There was an attack at the hospital."</p><p>"What?!" Tsunade demanded, all pretences of politeness falling away in an instant.</p><p>He held up a hand in the most patronising of placating gestures. "Since I was at the tower when the report came in, I authorised a squad to pursue the attackers. I'm sure the situation will be dealt with shortly."</p><p>"I do not take an attack on my hospital lightly," Tsunade growled.</p><p>Personally, I thought the claim that Danzo was at the tower in the middle of the night was also as suspicious as hell, but maybe she was just moving down the list in order of priority.</p><p>"Initial reports suggest that there was no damage to the facility," Danzo offered, seeming to pull back <em> just a fraction</em> at her response. "And the only patient missing is Shikako Nara. Which makes the target of the attack fairly clear, I think. Obviously I suspect Hidden Cloud-"</p><p>"Shikako Nara," Tsunade repeated flatly. "Missing from the hospital? Of course she is; I released her into the care of the Nara clan earlier today."</p><p>"What?" Danzo froze.</p><p>"If they can't even match an up-to-date patient list, then the rest of the report is immediately suspect," Tsunade snapped. "I'm going to deal with this <em> personally.</em> " She clicked her fingers and Sasuke and I rose on command, following her as she strode back into the house. "You two guard the house. I'll return when I've dealt with this."</p><p>She vanished in a body flicker and performed which was probably the fastest clothes change in human history, flickering <em> back</em> past us impeccably dressed and hustling Danzo out of the house with the finality of a slammed door.</p><p>Sasuke looked at me. "You are the luckiest goddamn person in this whole village," he said, voice tinged with disbelief.</p><p>I huffed something that was nearly a laugh. "I just have really good friends," I said tiredly.</p><p><hr /></p><p>When Tsunade returned, it was a lot closer to dawn and Sasuke had spent most of the intervening time trying to force feed me biscuits.</p><p>Everything tasted like chalk dust. It probably wasn't the fault of the food.</p><p>"Alright," Tsunade said, breezing back into the house. There was a steely glint in her eyes. "Where were we?"</p><p>"What was <em> that</em> all about?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"That's what I'd really like to find out," Tsunade said grimly. "I don't appreciate people playing games behind my back."</p><p>She ushered us back into the secure room, and I started where I'd left off.</p><p>Well, no, actually. I started from scratch again, because it was <em> easier</em> to retrace the same words when I knew what I was saying. They were all there, one after the other, like breadcrumbs marking a trail.</p><p>"On the 24th, Aoba and I-"</p><p>I reached the point where we'd left off. "Aoba found a symbol," I said, weighing every word. "A circle with a triangle inside it – the symbol of the Jashin cult. He went to go and investigate it, to see if he could find out who it was."</p><p>"You said the monks," Sasuke realised.</p><p>Tsunade waved him silent, sharply.</p><p>"The monks," I agreed, subdued. "They must have… I think they knew we were looking for them."</p><p>I closed my eyes. This was the most important part. The hardest, least truthful part. I had to be careful, to fit my words into this correctly, and never trip over them.</p><p>"They had… some kind of spiritual connection to Jashin, I think," I said. "It made them stronger. Faster. They could heal from all kinds of damage – stab wounds and fire and even beheading."</p><p><em> Careful, careful.</em> I balanced on the tightrope of truth.</p><p>It was true. It had just never happened.</p><p>"They could… if they got your blood, they could make a connection," I said, slowly. "Kind of like Shadow Possession. Except it didn't make you mirror their movements, it mirrored their <em> injuries.</em> "</p><p>Sasuke reached out and gripped my sleeve.</p><p>"So, if you attacked them," I went on, just to make sure, just to be clear, "it hurt you, too. And they could heal."</p><p>"That would be very hard to fight against," Tsunade said, gently. "Especially as a team."</p><p>Sasuke looked at her sharply.</p><p>As long as she <em> knew.</em> There was no better way to warn her about Hidan than this. And people needed to be warned.</p><p>"They also had a seal," I said, waving a hand listlessly. "It was big. Over the whole village. It must have been there for years." I closed my eyes, thinking, trying to make it add up. "She said they changed the bells. It was at midnight at first, but they moved them to dusk. Because people complained. So, they couldn't have been there forever? Or people would have been used to it. They must have arrived recently…"</p><p>"We can find out," Tsunade said. "If it's important."</p><p>I shrugged. Did it matter, really? "They had a seal," I repeated, doubling back. "It was the size of the whole village. It took- it gathered energy from the village, from the people. Like-" I flicked my gaze to Tsunade, hoping she would put it together. "But not <em> chakra.</em> Not even natural energy. I don't. I don't know what it took, exactly. <em> Life</em> energy or…"</p><p>Her face blanked. "What did it do?"</p><p>"It took energy," I said, fumbling haltingly with the words. "I was so tired. The animals just died. The kids. They were… they wouldn't wake up."</p><p>I sounded so plaintive, so helpless. Like there was anything Tsunade could do about it <em> now.</em></p><p>She rose from her seat and circled the table, resting hands on my shoulders and sending diagnostic chakra into my system. "You came in with symptoms similar to chakra exhaustion, but your levels were fine. Given your state, we considered it to be a result of prolonged jutsu usage, but if it was because of a seal…"</p><p>"Can you fix it?" Sasuke asked, sharply. His hand tightened its grip on my sleeve.</p><p>"It's an unusual case, but she's in no danger," Tsunade said, which wasn't exactly an answer. "What did the seal do?"</p><p>I shuddered. Inside and out.</p><p>"It-" I whispered, throat dry. "They-"</p><p><em> I didn't want to-</em></p><p>"Shikako," Tsunade said, voice clear and calm. Her chakra was buzzing calmly, stopping the racing of my heart, smoothing out my breathing. Overriding the fear response. "It's over now. Whatever happened, it's over."</p><p>"There was so much blood," I said, so that she would understand.</p><p>If she hadn't been touching me, hadn't been so close, I would have never noticed the flinch.</p><p>"It was everywhere."</p><p>My hands were shaking. I couldn't. I couldn't.</p><p>"Take it slow," Tsunade instructed. "Breathe. Come on, Shikako."</p><p>I breathed. Let her count it out for me. Let her chakra chase away the adrenaline, the chemical stimuli.</p><p>Facts. Just keep it factual.</p><p>"They took us to the temple," I said. "They killed Aoba. They wanted… wanted to bring Jashin in. To the world. But it wouldn't have… but it wouldn't have <em> stayed</em> the world. Not the same. Jashin wasn't a <em> thing</em> . Not like the bijuu. He made reality different."</p><p>It didn't sound enough. Didn't communicate how <em> wrong</em> it was. The pain and misery and death. Were there enough words in all of the human language for that? If there were, I didn't know them.</p><p>"He was in my head," I whispered. Whimpered.</p><p><em> Nearly there. Nearly there. Just a little further.</em></p><p>"He would have done things… I couldn't- I couldn't let that happen," I said. "I was going to contain it. The way they wanted to contain… the other… it would have been bad." My voice slipped, starting to plead. "It would have been bad, I know. It would have killed a lot of people. Maybe the whole village. But. But I didn't-"</p><p>Tsunade stroked my shoulders. "What happened?" she asked, quietly. Maybe she could already see.</p><p>"They broke it," I said. "My seal. It wasn't strong enough-" I shuddered. "They broke it, and it exploded."</p><p>Sasuke's grip was painful, now. But I didn't want him to let go.</p><p>"My summons," I said, one last gasp to explain. "They pulled me out. But I saw it."</p><p>And that was it. That was as far as I could go.</p><p>"I saw it," I said, and crumbled.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Hot Springs Arc: Chapter 132</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 132</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The art of life is to know how to enjoy a little and to endure very much.~ William Hazlitt</p><p></em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Hawk," Tsunade asked, speaking over my head. "Is your identity compromised?"</p><p>Sasuke turned his face towards her, blank mask firmly in place. He still seemed nonplussed by the question.</p><p>Given that he still had the sleeve of my borrowed cloak in a death grip, it seemed like a bit of a redundant question.</p><p>I managed to roll my eyes. "I know it's Sasuke," I said. "I can sense his chakra." Just in case she thought he had betrayed his secret ANBU oaths or whatever.</p><p>"I thought as much," she acknowledged, sounding a little wry. "In that case, Hawk, I'm reassigning you."</p><p>His shoulders went stiff.</p><p>"Bodyguard duty," she went on. "If the attack at the hospital really was to target Shikako, then there might be a follow up attack and she's in no state to defend herself."</p><p>I felt like I should object to that but it was… pretty true, really. I'd only <em> really</em> know if it came to a fight, but I certainly wasn't at my best right now.</p><p>"And you're uniquely situated to be able to hang around the Nara household without any questions asked," she continued dryly.</p><p>"Yes, Hokage-sama," Sasuke said, instantly.</p><p>If she hadn't assigned him, I was pretty sure he would have done it anyway. Which was probably the point.</p><p>Tsunade gave my shoulders another squeeze and moved around to sit back at the table.</p><p>"Shikako," she said, "do you know anything about the attack at the hospital?"</p><p>I paused for a long moment. I had no idea what Sai had planned. Would telling her get him in more trouble? I didn't want to do <em> anything</em> that would make things worse for him. Not when he was trying to help me. And it all circled back around to the question of 'how much did she know'? If she did know, what was she doing or not doing? What was Danzo doing or not doing?</p><p>Too many variables. Not enough data to work with.</p><p>My silence must have stretched out too long. Sasuke pulled on my wrist, shaking me slightly.</p><p>I blinked. "The hospital is very secure," I said, vaguely. Even without the extra security of the secure wing, it was right in the heart of Konoha, filled with people (most of them ninja) at all hours. If you were going to fill a place with paranoid ninja at their very weakest, it had <em> better</em> be safe.</p><p>Tsunade's lips thinned. "Yes," she agreed, but didn't press me for any actual details I may or may not have known.</p><p>Which was good. I didn't think I'd be able to come up with a convincing lie on the spot.</p><p>"Now, both of you," she said and paused, meaningfully. "You have to understand that this is S-rank classified. This is <em> the most</em> classified thing you will ever know in your lifetime, do you understand? Even more than Naruto's status, even more than your other missions… this is it. If anyone ever finds out that Konoha was, however indirectly, involved in this incident… I don't have to spell out how bad that would be."</p><p><em> Incident.</em> Such a neat little word.</p><p>What was the saying? One death was a tragedy, a million was a statistic?</p><p>It didn't feel like a statistic.</p><p>"But-" Sasuke started, then stopped. "Wouldn't the truth-"</p><p>"How many people do you think will believe it?" Tsunade said. Gently, even. Patiently. "That it was all the fault of some obscure cult worshipping an evil god? And now they're all dead? And, amazingly, the ninja we sent to deal with it was one that happens to specialise in seals and explosions?"</p><p>I swallowed.</p><p>Sasuke shook his head. In denial, not of her words, but of the truth of them.</p><p>But she was right. She couldn't let that be tied to this village – not when the truth only barely excused the outcome.</p><p>I could say 'it would have been worse' but what evidence did I have? Only what I'd lived, what I knew, what I'd seen. And that would never stand up in the court of public opinion.</p><p>The burden of proof would be on us, and we'd never be able to supply anything adequate. And even if we did, the other villages had too much to gain from holding us at knifepoint over it.</p><p>In a way… I was a little glad that she didn't plan on telling anyone. No one would know. I wouldn't have to deal with people <em> knowing.</em> Their reactions and judgements. I was pretty sure that those were going to be bad enough as it was, without <em> that</em> added on.</p><p>"What do we stay instead?" I rasped.</p><p>Tsunade nodded. "You were on a mission to the Land of Rice Fields," she said crisply. "Aoba was killed and you managed to escape and headed south for reinforcements. It was classified, of course, and you can't talk about it, so the details don't really matter at this point. I'll have a report drawn up for you to memorise and sign, and some of that will end up leaked which will provide you with a bit of an alibi."</p><p>I nodded. It was simple, enough. Straightforward. This, then this. Smooth, efficient clean up. All the pieces tucked away back into their boxes and the game board cleared.</p><p>"As for your … injury," she went on and frowned slightly, seeming to consider.</p><p>Not so much the injury as the recovery. All those questions of <em> why</em> and <em> how</em> would dig too deeply into a situation we didn't want people looking at – and my clan knew how to ask. Timing wise, we were already skating on thin ice with the 'attack' on the hospital and I <em> certainly</em> didn't want anyone looking into it, not if there was a risk they would see Danzo at the other end.</p><p>"Activation cost," I said, slumping forward. "Or… deactivation cost. Call it an active technique that required a substantial chakra input in order to end. I needed to save up enough chakra to safely cancel the technique. You said the symptoms were similar to chakra exhaustion, and my clan knows I'm working on techniques with chakra cycling…"</p><p>"Your brothers arm," Tsunade said, in recognition. "It's little implausible but not <em> impossible…</em> yes, I think that would work. And a discharge for chakra exhaustion certainly isn't out of the ordinary."</p><p>Details were hammered out. Tsunade produced a hospital discharge form, conveniently backdated. Sasuke helped me back into my ANBU mask because, having arrived as an ANBU, it was wiser for me to leave as one.</p><p>"Come on," Sasuke said, leading me away from the house, and we flittered through some twisting streets of the village, before ducking into a side door of a building complex. It wasn't exactly <em> hidden</em> – in the sense of genjutsu – but it was out of the way and discrete. And probably secured in some way, if the slight pause as Sasuke opened it was any indication.</p><p>Inside, well, inside it looked like an office filing room. Boring and normal. Steel filing cabinets, shelves covered in binders, a low bench along one wall and a plastic pot plant. But Sasuke opened a drawer with a particular twist of chakra and revealed that this was, instead, basically a Secret ANBU Locker Room.</p><p>"It's a waypoint," he said. "Because, you know, it's totally inconspicuous when an ANBU leaves your house every day. No one would ever work it out."</p><p>"Makes sense," I rasped.</p><p>There was an 'I'd tell you but then I'd have to kill you' joke to be made here, surely, but I couldn't work out how to frame it to account for secret rooms I shouldn't have known about and then the moment passed.</p><p>It probably would have only been funny to me, anyway.</p><p>"Tsunade gave me your gear from the hospital," Sasuke said, withdrawing one of the scrolls she had given him. She had probably picked it up while she was there sorting everything else out, since that was a bit of a giveaway that I hadn't signed myself out under normal procedures.</p><p>But then he opened it.</p><p><em> Well, I can't wear those.</em></p><p>Sasuke recoiled, just a bit. Someone at the hospital had helpfully shoved my clothes into plastic bags before sealing them, probably because <em> contamination</em> , but it was pretty clear they were beyond saving.</p><p>"There was a lot of blood," I repeated, distantly.</p><p>But my necklace glinted at me, sitting quietly atop the pile, and I snagged it off and looped it around my neck. I channelled chakra through it, drawing it out, almost instinctively.</p><p>Something inside me settled, like I was no longer treading water just to stay present, like an anchor had been removed from my ankles. This stone was a safety net, a life preserver, holding me steady.</p><p>I let out a shaky breath. "Can you please just… get rid of those?"</p><p>"Sure," Sasuke said, quickly, sealing them back away in a hurry. "There should be something here you can wear, instead."</p><p>"I've got stuff," I said, twisting my wrist and pulling clothes out of hammerspace. It seemed obvious now. Sensible. I even had spare shoes in there, because I'd destroyed a pair on a mission once, and that meant I'd been running around in bare feet for no real reason whatsoever. Very clever of me.</p><p>I pulled out a hair tie and hesitated, contemplating if I could be bothered with the hassle of trying to do my hair, or I should just leave it hanging loose and tangled and annoying.</p><p>"Here," Sasuke said, easily plucking it out of my fingers and then moving behind me. His fingers deftly wove through my hair, only pulling occasionally at clumps of tangles. It was surprisingly skilful, but then a three strand braid was child's play compared to the various knots and rope tricks we'd been taught at the Academy.</p><p>"Thanks," I said. There was nothing to examine my reflection in, but I felt more like Shikako The Shinobi. Hair out of the way, chin up, shoulders rolled back. If not actual strength, then at least the veneer of it.</p><p>Piecing myself back together. One stone. Then two. A foundation to build the rest upon.</p><p>Once I was dressed, I folded up the ANBU cloak and mask and then dropped it into hammerspace – while staring Sasuke dead in the face. He looked very briefly amused.</p><p>"That's a security hazard," he said, and then failed to ask for them back.</p><p>I wasn't sure if Sai <em> needed</em> them back, if anyone would notice it was missing, and if he did I wanted to have it on hand. And if he didn't, then I was pretty sure I could come up with ways that an ANBU mask would be useful.</p><p>Sasuke barely changed, exchanging the white chest plate and arm and leg guards for a wide necked shirt no different to the ones he normally wore. Most notably, he kept his sword, which made sense since he was nominally still on duty and it wasn't an <em> unusual</em> weapon for Sasuke-not-Hawk to be carrying anyway.</p><p>We didn't leave through the same exit – which I guessed kept with the 'secrecy' thing, because if someone were watching it then an ANBU entering and someone else leaving would be fairly obvious – instead sliding further into the building proper and twisting through several hallways to exit out a different door.</p><p>Except we didn't make it all the way home before I had to stop and lean heavily against a wall.</p><p>"Shikako?" Sasuke asked, hovering a touch too close.</p><p>"Fine," I said, through gritted teeth, trying to marshal my chakra. It was all there. It was all <em> fine.</em> What was with this stupid feeling of weakness?</p><p>"I can-"</p><p>"I can walk!" I snapped, shaking his hand off.</p><p>Sasuke backed off, eyes dark.</p><p>I forced myself off of the wall. We were nearly there, anyway. And I could hardly be <em> carried</em> back when we were trying to assert that the whole reason I was out of the hospital was that I was <em> better.</em> Sure. That'd be really convincing.</p><p>Slowly, but with one foot in front of the other and on and on again, we reached the Nara clan lands. Sasuke paced coolly beside me the entire way, within reach but without offering again.</p><p>"Tadaima," I called, voice sounding weak and thready as I pushed open the front door. I had to sit on the step of the front entrance way to laboriously remove my shoes and by the time I'd stood, Shikamaru had skidded into the room.</p><p>"Shikako?" He asked, incredulously, eyes flicking over to Sasuke before hardening. "You're supposed to be in hospital."</p><p>"Well, I'm not," I said, self-evidently.</p><p>Mom interrupted, hurrying down the stairs with Kino in her arms.</p><p>"Shikako!" she seemed a mix between surprised and confused, with the beginnings of worry starting to peak through.</p><p>I managed to dredge up a tired smile. "Surprise?"</p><p>She hovered indecisively for a second, before handing Kino off to my brother so that we could hug. I leant into her, gratefully, warm and comforting and steady.</p><p>"Oh, but how? No one told us… We didn't think you'd be released so quickly!"</p><p>Which was a very delicate way of saying that I'd been in no state to actually <em> leave</em> .</p><p>"Ah, you know," I said vaguely, carefully making my way over to the couch to sit. "I don't like to stay in hospital any longer than I have to."</p><p>"But- you-" Shikamaru spluttered. "Are you <em> okay?</em> "</p><p>"Perfectly fine," I said, waving it off with a vague hand motion. "Just a bit tired. Chakra exhaustion, you know? And there was some kind of commotion at the hospital last night; I didn't get much sleep."</p><p>"An attack," Sasuke filled in and everyone's eyes jumped to him. Interestingly, mum seemed to look him over, eyes darting from his pants to his shoes neatly removed in the foyer – the parts that were still ANBU uniform. Huh. "No one was hurt and nothing is missing, but I think Hokage-sama took it as a personal offence."</p><p>As far as diversions went, this was probably not the greatest. On the other hand, the attack wasn't going to be a secret so they would find out about it eventually and this way it distanced me from it. Sort of. It still made the timelines messy between when I was supposed to be places and according to who but that couldn't be helped without making people suspicious.</p><p>"Oh, is that what happened?" I yawned. "She did seem pretty annoyed."</p><p>Shikamaru still looked confused, like he was two steps behind, but at least it wasn't worry. "Chakra exhaustion?" He parroted. "That's <em> all?</em> "</p><p>"Yeah," I agreed. "It took a lot of energy to cancel that technique." I shrugged a shoulder. "Took a bit longer than I thought it would, but all's well that ends well, right?"</p><p>The words were shockingly bitter on my tongue, even if I managed to say them lightly. I was goading him now, pressing all the buttons our long arguments had exposed – too casual, too dismissive, too self-centred.</p><p>As expected his jaw hardened, teeth clenched as he bit back whatever response he wanted to give that. "So, it was on purpose," he said, and yep, that was definitely anger.</p><p>Good. If he was angry then he wasn't <em> thinking about it.</em></p><p>He had to have accepted, subconsciously, that it was <em> true.</em></p><p>"More or less," I agreed, lightly. That was a nicer, kinder, truth, wasn't it? Imagine it was deliberate, intentional. Imagine there had been no horror so great that there was no other option. Just a choice, a switch to flick – yes or no.</p><p>Wasn't that nicer?</p><p>Shikamaru drew back, away, shoulders tight. "Well, if that's all," he said, sarcasm heavy in his voice. "Maybe when you're done throwing yourself recklessly into danger and worrying everyone, you could consider filling your clan duties instead. I understand they come with a much lower chance of permanent injury and death, but I'm sure you could think of something."</p><p>I let the façade of lightness fall away. "I'll check my schedule," I said, flintily.</p><p>As if their <em> worry</em> was my chief concern right now. He could take his <em> worry</em> and deal with it himself. However he fucking wanted.</p><p>Shikamaru snorted, dismissively. "Whatever."</p><p>He left the house, not quite slamming the door behind him, and I sank into the couch, that brief spat having taken whatever energy I'd managed to regain.</p><p>Sasuke looked horribly awkward, and Mom was looking between me and the door, a faintly irritated frown on her face.</p><p>I… didn't want to deal with that.</p><p>"I'm pretty tired," I said, which was nowhere near as much of a lie as I wanted it to be. "I might just take a nap."</p><p>"You should probably have something to eat," Sasuke suggested.</p><p>"Later," I murmured, twisting myself around to lie on the couch. My room suddenly seemed far too far away. I'd go there in a minute. I just needed to close my eyes. "You've got first watch, right?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Sasuke's chakra – bright and alert. Someone approaching the house.</p><p>I woke, blearily.</p><p>Ino.</p><p>No. No, I didn't- I didn't have the energy. Not to be friendly with Ino, and certainly not to lie to her face about what had happened. She would <em> know</em> .</p><p>I wiggled my shoulders back into the couch cushions, tucked my chin under the blanket someone had draped over me and tried to drift back off to sleep.</p><p>"-would have thought you'd be on duty," Ino was saying, voice drifting through the house.</p><p>"-just how the roster works out sometimes," Sasuke replied. "Lucky, I guess."</p><p>I remained stubbornly asleep, tracking their movements through chakra and sound. Sasuke was near silent, even the shuffle of cloth somehow muted and quiet. If it wasn't for his chakra, I might have thought he wasn't there at all.</p><p>Ino patted my hair and smoothed down the blanket, but didn't stay for very long, saying something about being on her lunch break and needing to go.</p><p>"I'll let everyone know that she's home," she said, sounding more practical than disappointed. "If they don't already know by now."</p><p>Sasuke hesitated. "She probably doesn't want too many visitors," he said awkwardly. I was grateful.</p><p>Ino gave a short laugh. "That's how I know she's <em> actually</em> hurt," she said. Her hair swished as she shook her head. "I'll tell them. Let her know I stopped by, okay?"</p><p>I waited until she was gone – not just out of the house but out of range – before I opened my eyes. Sasuke didn't startle, exactly, but he did sharpen his attention.</p><p>"Thanks," I rasped. "I'd rather be alone."</p><p>He nodded, curtly, like he understood that. "You should have something to eat."</p><p>"I'm not really hungry," I said. It was true, but I knew I should eat anyway. These symptoms were old, old friends of mine, showing up in exciting new contexts like a repeating motif to life. Lack of appetite, lethargy, cold.</p><p>"Eat anyway," Sasuke said, disappearing to the kitchen and coming back with a bowl of rice, an energy shake and a bottle of vitamins. Clever.</p><p>I managed a couple of mouthfuls of rice, chewing it to mush before I could bring myself to swallow and half of the drink. It would have to do.</p><p>I lay back down but couldn't go back to sleep. But the idea of actually getting up and trying to do something – even things that really needed to be done – was nearly unthinkable. There was a whole list of tasks I could, should and normally would do… and yet every single one of them seemed unappealing.</p><p>I picked a book off the bookshelf, some old and battered children's book that I'd read repetitively during my younger years. The story was familiar if not terribly engaging. Even less so we I finished reading and couldn't decide what else to do so just … started over again.</p><p>"Are you… okay?" Sasuke asked, cautiously.</p><p>I dropped the book onto my chest, half way through it for the third time. "I'm bored," I told him, pathetically. "But I don't want to do anything."</p><p>I could hear mom moving around the house, and my childhood had conditioned me to be wary of speaking those words. Any utterance of 'I'm bored' was sure to be followed by a list of tasks one could accomplish instead.</p><p>He made a show of checking the clock. "So, that only took… six hours of being on medical leave?"</p><p>I threw the book at him. "Shuddup," I grumbled. "Aren't you bored?"</p><p>He shrugged. Yeah, that was different. He was <em> working.</em> "We could go for a walk," he suggested.</p><p>I agreed. Not because there was anywhere in particular I wanted to go, I just didn't want to remain here doing nothing.</p><p>We didn't go far, just wandered around the Nara forest, and didn't go fast either because I kept feeling the need to stop and rest. It was probably a good thing we weren't on any kind of schedule.</p><p>"Are you going to let me help you this time?" Sasuke asked, arms crossed. He raised an eyebrow, challenging.</p><p>I leant against the tree and scowled. It was unfair – I'd managed a desperate sprint from the hospital to the Hokage residence last night. I should be able to manage <em> a</em> <em> walk.</em></p><p>"I hate being helpless," I said. "That was the worst thing-"</p><p>I trailed off. How could I pick any <em> one</em> aspect as 'the worst thing'? How was that one, personal touch more awful than any of the others?</p><p>"They're all the worst things," Sasuke said, looking away.</p><p>Yeah, he got it. It wasn't a ranking, or a value. It was just shifting the focus to look at one thing at a time. Skirting around the edges of the whole that was just too much, too big to ever really talk about.</p><p>"The worst thing," I murmured, pushing on. I didn't look at him, either. "I thought I was strong, but they took that away so easily. I couldn't do anything."</p><p>I listened to the sounds of the forest – the wind in the trees, the birds, the insects, somewhere in the distance the deer – and our own, slightly ragged breathing.</p><p>"You did do something," Sasuke said, slightly haltingly. "You made a friend that dragged you out of it."</p><p>That wasn't-</p><p>Wasn't where I thought that was going to go. It wasn't right but it wasn't wrong either. Still helpless, in the moment of truth. But actions <em> before</em> that played into it, too.</p><p>I huffed and tipped my head back against the rough tree bark. "Voice of experience?" I said, dryly.</p><p>"I have this one friend that always seems to pull me out of trouble," Sasuke said, voice equally, equally dry. "And if I can make one, you've probably got dozens."</p><p>There wasn't much I could say to that. "I really ought to make a rule about people using my own actions and words against me in arguments," I reflected.</p><p>Sasuke snorted. "It is the easiest way to defeat you," he said. "Almost like you made a good point about it or something."</p><p>"Ha ha," I said, not laughing at all. "Jerk."</p><p>I pushed myself off the tree. I didn't wobble or go lightheaded or anything like that. There was no <em> cause.</em> "I can walk," I said. "It might take more energy and effort than normal, but I <em> can do it.</em> "</p><p>"Well, maybe you could get a cane then," he suggested.</p><p>I made a face. "Ugh."</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning no one actually commented on Sasuke still being here – probably because he was helping Mom with Kino-chan and Shikamaru hadn't been around enough to realise that he never left.</p><p>I thought about asking Shikamaru what he was busy <em> doing</em> but I honestly wasn't sure I was prepared to deal with whatever it was.</p><p>Actually, Mom was pretty busy too. Which meant it was definitely a clan something. Which meant –</p><p>I wandered outside to sit on the veranda in the sun and watch Sasuke pace through some warm up sword kata's, hands wrapped around a cup of hot tea and a blanket around my shoulders.</p><p>Which was how I was when Sai came to visit.</p><p>"Sai!" I dashed closer, aware of Sasuke dropping out of his kata to trail me. I honestly hadn't expected him and there was an incredible gut-punch of relief to know that he was okay.</p><p>"I am here to communicate my well wishes for your recovery," he said, smiling blandly.</p><p>"Can I hug you?" I asked, and waited for his nod before throwing my arms around his shoulders. He didn't make any move, and I tried to take that as 'not knowing what to do', rather than 'not wanting it'.</p><p>"I was worried," I murmured quietly into his ear, voice too low to be overheard. "You didn't get into trouble for helping me?"</p><p>His hair brushed my cheek as he minutely shook his head. "You were simply not present when the retrieval team arrived. It was not accounted for in the mission planning and the team was not able to make a field decision to update their objectives."</p><p>It was very nearly a quote, which probably meant he was teasing. For Sai, anyway.</p><p>I drew back.</p><p>"I must also ask about your mission," he said.</p><p>I took a deep breath in and let it out slowly. "It was a classified mission to the Land of Rice Fields," I said, carefully and calmly. "We encountered problems and my partner was killed. I was injured. But I'm better now."</p><p>Details and no details at all. Hopefully that would be enough for Sai. It wasn't much, but if Tsunade did leak the 'report' at least it would corroborate it.</p><p>Sasuke was hanging back, looking at me with a raised eyebrow. And yeah, there was pretty much no way to explain this interaction without delving into the whole 'Danzo' issue, though I was pretty sure that Sasuke could put together that <em> someone</em> had helped me out of the hospital.</p><p>"So," I asked, lamely. "How's your art going?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>So you can mostly blame Shikamaru for how long this chapter took. Funnily enough, this was the <em> nicest</em> way that conversation could have gone.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 133</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Most of life is showing up. You do the best you can, which varies from day to day. ~ Regina Brett</p><p></em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Match," Sasuke said, snapping up another card.</p><p>I dropped my cards and sighed. "Why am I playing reflex games with you?" I asked rhetorically.</p><p>"Because you were bored and didn't want to think of strategy?" he suggested. He scooped the cards up and started shuffling them, the cards deftly flying between his hands.</p><p>"Bad choice on my part," I mused, looking out over the garden.</p><p>The problem was I <em> was</em> bored. Actual work required more mental effort than I was willing to muster – soon, soon, but not yet – and doing nothing just left thinking myself in circles which just wasn't productive and was bad for my mood.</p><p>What had been done was done. Thinking about it didn't make it change. The truth was that it had happened. That I had been an integral, if unwilling, part of making it happen. Not my intent. Not my set up. Not my disastrous breaking of the seal.</p><p>But yes. I had set it. If I hadn't set it, it could not have broken. There would have been no explosion.</p><p>But if I hadn't set it, then the ritual would have succeeded.</p><p>Stalemate.</p><p>And there was nothing that I could do to fix that. I couldn't undo it. I couldn't bring back the dead. I couldn't make reparations. There was no seal, no prosthetic to make here.</p><p>All I could do was <em> think</em> and there was no benefit in that.</p><p>It had happened. I'd seen the direct aftermath. Touched the ash. Heard the screams. Seen the destruction.</p><p>What did you do after that?</p><p>"Deal again?" Sasuke asked, tapping the shuffled cards on the shogi board we were using as a table.</p><p>I sighed. "Why not?"</p><p>Obligingly, he dealt the cards out. The morning stretched endlessly around us – without training or study I didn't really know how to fill it.</p><p>I was so bad at this.</p><p>"Oh, hey! It's Tenten." I waved at the figure approaching the house. She wasn't the first person to stop by, not even today, and while circling awkwardly not talking about things was frustrating and tiring, at least it was a distraction. In small doses.</p><p>"Hey," she said, stopping next to us. "How are you?"</p><p>It was nothing but pure polite formality.</p><p>I shrugged. "Recovering. I miss the days I could walk around the house without having to take a breather, but I'll get there."</p><p>"I tell you, you should get a cane," Sasuke repeated.</p><p>I made a face at him.</p><p>Tenten laughed. "Well, if you do make sure it's a sword cane," she advised.</p><p>I was about to refute it then I paused and considered. "I could have a sword cane," I said thoughtfully.</p><p>It wasn't, necessarily, that I needed a concealed weapon. Not when it was perfectly okay to walk around Konoha with an <em> actual</em> sword on your back. But it was just <em> cool.</em></p><p>"Really?" Sasuke asked dryly. "That's what it takes?"</p><p>I shrugged at him. "Don't knock it." I switched my attention back to Tenten so she wasn't totally ignored by our bickering. "How's things with you?"</p><p>"My team is being deployed," she said, shifting slightly. Not quite nervously, but… apprehension? I wasn't sure. "We'll probably be gone for a while so I wanted to come and sort things out with Shikamaru before I left."</p><p>"Oh," I said and blinked. There were ways to take that that weren't bad, but her apologetic smile didn't exactly leave a lot of options. "Well. He's inside."</p><p>She nodded. "Thanks," she said, as she slipped past us. "I'm really glad you're okay, though."</p><p>I waited until she was inside and raised my eyes at Sasuke. "That's going to be a supremely awkward conversation."</p><p>"Yep," he agreed which meant that it was obvious enough for Sasuke to notice. Not necessarily care, but notice.</p><p>I considered how much I didn't really want to be in the vicinity of that and pushed myself to my feet. "Okay," I declared. "Let's go get me a sword cane."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Finding a sword cane wasn't actually hard; this <em> was</em> Konoha.</p><p>But there was an odd atmosphere in town. Not quiet or fearful – this was still a ninja village, it'd take more than a disaster a long way away to make that happen. But there were fewer ninja around, and those that I saw were moving with a sense of <em> purpose.</em></p><p>And their uniforms…</p><p>I could ignore a lot of things if I didn't want to see them, if no one shoved them in my face, but once I'd seen them…</p><p>"The funeral has already been, right?" I asked Sasuke, voice quiet.</p><p>Sasuke hesitated. "Yeah," he said, almost reluctantly.</p><p>I nodded. Konoha was… efficient, particularly in this regard. Quiet and unobtrusive an undeniably efficient.</p><p>"I have to get something," I said vaguely, looking around for the shop I wanted. It didn't take long to find it, or to purchase it, or to walk towards the cemetery. A little longer, maybe, to find the headstone designated for Aoba but… it was a nice day for a walk.</p><p>I put the sunglasses down, next to the small vase of flowers and the stick of burning incense.</p><p>"Sorry," I said.</p><p>But no. It felt wrong. Foolish. To try and speak to a stone that wasn't, couldn't be, any kind of representation of Aoba.</p><p>How did that poem go? <em> Do not stand at my grave and forever weep I am not there I do not sleep</em></p><p>Aoba wasn't here. Wouldn't be here even if his body hadn't been turned to ash and swept away on the breeze. Whether he was in whatever afterlife he believed in, or had been reincarnated or … whatever had happened to him, he wasn't here. Nothing I said would reach him. So therefore, talking was just… performative. Empty.</p><p>If I said 'sorry' I was only saying it to myself, not to him.</p><p>I sighed and turned away. "Let's go home."</p><p>It wasn't the grave stone that made it real. It was all the places that Aoba wouldn't be – it'd be his desk in the Intel Department, cleaned and reassigned. It'd be a Special Jounin gathering, with no empty seat for him. It'd be no one to take a problem to, no one to ask a question. It'd be knowledge, lost. Stories, lost.</p><p>Sasuke didn't say anything. Maybe he didn't know what to say. I sure didn't.</p><p>But there was someone waiting for us by the gates; Anko, leaning casually against a nearby tree. Unobtrusive, out of the way, but her gaze flickered to us when we approached in a way that said she was waiting.</p><p>Sasuke drew closer to me, alert and wary.</p><p>"Anko-senpai," I greeted because of all the people in Konoha I didn't think<em> Anko</em> was working for Danzo. "Can I help you?"</p><p>"Hey," she said, standing up straight and sticking her hands in her pockets. "I heard you were finally up and about. How are you feeling?"</p><p>I gave a half-shrug. "Getting there," I hedged. "You know how it is."</p><p>She nodded and gave me a lacklustre grin that came nowhere close to her usual level of spark. "Aoba was a good friend of mine."</p><p>"I'm sorry," I said, sympathetically. <em> For your loss</em> silent but implied.</p><p>"Me too," she said. "Ah, that's not how I meant to start this. He was a good friend – he had a lot of friends – so of course we all kept our ears open…"</p><p>I turned that statement over, matched it with what I knew about Tsunade's plans. "The mission report leaked," I said. I didn't sound surprised, even to myself. "Well. I guess it was bound to happen, Aoba <em> was</em> involved…"</p><p>It startled a laugh out of her, sharp but still humorous. I was glad, the second it was out of my mouth I'd thought it might have been too irreverent. Too soon.</p><p>"It's what he would have wanted," she mocked. "But I wanted to make sure you knew," she added. "It sucks to be blindsided with something like that."</p><p>I nodded, seriously. "Thank you."</p><p>"Sure," she said, lifting one hand in a lazy salute. "And, you know… he was a good ninja. Couldn't keep his mouth shut, but he knew what he was doing in the field." She lifted her gaze over my shoulder, towards the cemetery. "We spent a lot of time behind enemy lines, me and him. If you couldn't send a Yamanaka, you sent Aoba." Her eyes met mine, steady this time. "What I'm saying is… whatever happened out there, Aoba knew what he was getting into. As much as any of us ever know."</p><p>I drew in a shuddering breath. "I know," I said, simply. I'd been in charge, true. I'd suggested pushing forward, true. But the trouble we'd found ourselves in hadn't been anything we'd known about in advance. Hadn't been anything we could do anything about.</p><p>"He'd be glad you made it out," she added, gently. "Any of us would be. Sometimes that's all you can ask; that your team makes it out."</p><p>I closed my eyes. Thought about the despair in his face when he recognised me. <em> Oh no. Not you. I thought you made it out. I thought you were safe.</em> Thought about the fact that he'd died, knowing that I was there with him. He would never know I didn't die too, never know I'd made it out. Never know that I'd stopped it.</p><p>"I know," I repeated, hoarsely.</p><p>She nodded, rocking back on her heels, hands still in her pockets. "You're a smart kid; I figured you would," she admitted. "Still, it never hurts to say it." Sympathy, not pity. The knowledge of someone who had been there before.</p><p>I nodded at her, throat aching and closed over.</p><p>Anko stepped aside. "I'll see you at the kunoichi club," she tossed over her shoulder, by way of goodbye.</p><p>"Well," I said and paused. "At least we know it's all going according to plan?"</p><p>"I'm pretty sure that's something people say when things <em> aren't</em> going according to plan," Sasuke disagreed as we started moving.</p><p>"Ah, but you see," I said, pulling out my Most Serious And Wise voice, "I planned for you to say that."</p><p>Sasuke snorted and bumped his shoulder against mine, but gently enough that I didn't stagger. "And how do you figure that?" he asked.</p><p>"Well," I said. "If you consider my ability of complete hypnosis…"</p><p>He rolled his eyes at me. "I'm the one with hypnotising techniques, not you."</p><p>I smiled. "Oh, but that's just what I <em> want</em> you to think."</p><p>He scoffed and didn't dignify me with another response.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Of all the people I expected to visit me while I was convalescing, Kakashi-sensei was practically obligated to be on the list. I mean, I totally expected it to be a random happenstance encounter, oh my, and not an actual social call, but still.</p><p>Turned out I was right, it just took a little while to happen.</p><p>"I need to go report in," Sasuke told me, voice very low. "I'll be back really quickly."</p><p>I wasn't sure if Kakashi-sensei being here was the opportunity he was waiting for – someone he absolutely trusted with the duty – or if sensei had given him those instructions, somehow. I thought it was probably the latter, but I hadn't actually picked up any kind of signal.</p><p>"You could sit down," I suggested, as Sasuke vanished back towards the village.</p><p>Kakashi did so, looking pretty damn uncomfortable, even for Kakashi.</p><p>"So," I said. "War Operations, huh?"</p><p>Because I couldn't ignore it any longer. Kakashi-sensei was wearing the same uniform that the ninja in town had been. A heavy chest guard, layered over top of his jounin vest. The defensive measure of a ninja for who combat on a mission wasn't possible or expected, it was guaranteed<em> .</em> It was <em> intended.</em></p><p>War plate.</p><p>This was happening. This wasn't just people threatening and making noise. Konoha was rolling out tools and uniforms and starting to outfit people for war.</p><p>He drew in a sharp breath. "We were always going to go to war."</p><p>I blinked. Our trains of thought must have been on completely separate pathways because I had no idea where that had come from.</p><p>But sensei was looking at me urgently, like it was critical that I understood him. "It was always going to happen, do you understand?"</p><p>He wasn't… he wasn't <em> right</em> , though. There was a whole other world saying that this wasn't inevitable, was it? Or had it happened, in those off-screen years of the time skip and simply never been important to the story? Could we anticipate this being so short?</p><p>But I didn't think so. Because there had been too many changes. Not just Land of Hot Springs. There was the alliance with Mist and Sand, the chunin exam demonstration of our friendship that had accelerated things in so many different directions. There was Zabuza and Haku surviving at all. There was more than that, probably, deeper and layered underneath it but-</p><p>-those were the things I'd done. That had led to this.</p><p>I closed my eyes. That was what Kakashi-sensei was saying.</p><p>Kakashi, whose father had started a war and then killed himself.</p><p>"Whatever happened out there-" Kakashi-sensei said, and swallowed roughly. His hand hovered in the air before landing on my shoulder.</p><p>"Nothing happened," I said, eyes still closed. "You read my mission report, didn't you? I wasn't anywhere near Hidden Cloud. Nothing happened."</p><p>Not convincing, no. But Kakashi-sensei wasn't someone I really needed to convince. I just needed him to play the party line.</p><p>"It's not your fault," he whispered, sounding like he knew they were just words. Just sounds on the breeze.</p><p><em> Did he know about the attack</em> ? I wondered, suddenly. He clearly knew Sasuke was watching me. But if he didn't… what would he assume the constant watch was for? That would make him come out and say this?</p><p><em> Too obvious.</em></p><p>I opened my eyes. "Is there something I can do to help?" I asked. "My clan is busy making medicine and seals, so I'm going to be needed here but… I could help. Once I'm better."</p><p>Shikamaru, so stressed and busy. It made sense now. Dad always made look running the clan look easy, but even the day to day stuff wasn't. This would be even less so. I'd have to step up. I'd have to help.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei gave me a searching look, like he didn't quite know what to make of that. "I could always use more minions in the tower," he said.</p><p>I nodded, as brisk and professional as I could be, dressed in civilian attire in my own home. "And I have a barrier seal to finish refining," I said, more to myself than him. "That'd probably help if I can get it done. Everyone likes barriers."</p><p>I hadn't planned for this. Not exactly and not now. But I there were still things I could do. If I had contributed to this mess, then I could contribute to fixing it.</p><p>When Sasuke returned, Kakashi-sensei and I were sketching out plans in the dirt – plans for <em> what</em> wasn't necessarily clear because we had wandered from the initial premise in quite a substantial fashion – and he looked only a little bemused to see it.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei stood and dusted off his hands, like he totally hadn't been doing anything strange. "Ah, you know," he said, awkwardly, and scratched his cheek through his mask. "You'll both be fine. You're survivors; you'll make it through the war."</p><p>"We've got too much to do for anything else," Sasuke said, all smirking bravado but with the undercurrent of knowledge that it didn't really matter, that it was never down to you to choose.</p><p>"<em> Way</em> too much to do," I agreed.</p><p>That night, after dinner, a subdued Shikamaru pushed Kino-chan into my arms before going to help mom clean up in the kitchen.</p><p>I wiggled a soft toy at Kino, half-heartedly. He was, what, four weeks old now? Able to look at things and track them and make noises but that was about it. His chakra system was starting to kick in, and with zero increase in screaming, so he probably hadn't got any kind of sensitivity to chakra. I hadn't really expected him to because I knew what mine stemmed from and it seemed like pretty low odds that that would happen twice.</p><p>I gave Sasuke a meaningful eyebrow.</p><p>He huffed and made a show of reluctance. But Kino vanished from my arms pretty damn smartly and it was a series of events that made both of us happier, so … win.</p><p>"He's going to grow up in a world where we're at war," I said, thoughtfuly. It was still an abstract, still an idea more than a reality. I didn't know what a world at war looked like first-hand either – but it was stranger to think that Kino might not know what one at peace looked like. Sadder.</p><p>We weren't supposed to be the <em> last</em> children of peace.</p><p>"It won't touch him," Sasuke said, so fiercely that he would probably fight the whole damn war himself to make sure that didn't happen.</p><p>I nodded, slowly. "We'll make sure of it."</p><p>And the next morning, for the first time since I'd made it back to Konoha, I did my morning exercises, breathing in the damp dawn air.</p><p>It was hard - to find the motivation to start, to find the energy to complete it - but it felt like waking up.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Hot Springs Arc: Chapter 134</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Since people were wanting to get on with "the plot"…</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 134</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Looking back isn't going to help you. Moving forward is the thing you have to do. ~ McKayla Maroney</p><p></em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Well," Tsunade said, snapping my medical file closed. "According to all known medical tests, there's nothing wrong with you that more water, vitamins and sleep can't cure."</p><p>It certainly felt like I'd been subjected to all known tests, even if 'being looked over by Tsunade' probably substituted for a fair number of them. I got it, I did, and I knew I'd probably been lucky to get out of hospital the first round without being subjected to them all.</p><p>'Lucky' given the circumstances.</p><p>"So how do you actually feel?" she asked.</p><p>I swung my feet back and forth, perched on the edge of a hospital examination bed. "Tired, sometimes," I said, at length. <em> Tired</em> could mean too many things, but it was still the closest word. "It comes in waves. But other than that…" I shrugged.</p><p>"We've been sparring," Sasuke offered from where he was leaning against the wall. Technically, he probably shouldn't have been in here, but he was still officially on guard duty and he knew the whole story already and I would have only told him the results afterwards anyway so it was just easiest for him to stay. "Light sparring," he amended. "Her endurance is down a little but otherwise there's not a lot of change."</p><p>Tsunade nodded. "We'll keep an eye on it," she said. "I suspect any damage is going to show itself in the long term. Techniques that use life energy usually result in some form of increased aging – you aren't exhibiting any signs but that might be because you're still growing. You might be looking at stunted growth spurts or increased age related problems later in life."</p><p>"Using life energy shortens your life," I said quietly, thinking of Tsunade's own healing jutsu, the way it had been described and the reason that she wore her genjutsu glamour.</p><p>"In simplistic terms, yes," she agreed. "But right now, you're healthy. That's the important thing."</p><p>My smile twisted a bit at the edges. "Lucky."</p><p>Tsunade chuckled, and it sounded exactly as humourless as I felt. "You could have done worse for your winning hand." She reached over and laid her hand over top of mine – not the clinical, impersonal medical touch, but something that was meant to be warm and comforting. "You get good luck and you get bad luck. And sometimes they just happen at the same time. Don't conflate them and hold one responsible for the other. It doesn't work like that."</p><p>I bit my tongue and didn't ask how that worked for her. Tsunade was legendary for having luck that <em> was</em> exactly like that.</p><p>That didn't make her any less right.</p><p>No one would be any less dead if I wasn't healed. Being chronically injured or in pain or <em> whatever</em> wouldn't do anyone any good. It didn't balance any scales because there were no scales.</p><p>Shit, as they said, just happened.</p><p>"Yeah," I said, just a little belated. "Uh. So. I'm clear for duty?"</p><p>"<em> Light</em> duty," Tsunade emphasised. "And that means I'm also reassigning you." She raised her eyes to Sasuke. "I'm putting you back on the roster."</p><p>Sasuke crossed his arms but didn't actually protest it. I imagined he was pretty bored as well, given that no threat had materialised in my direction. Now he could go back to doing whatever he did in Anbu.</p><p>"Probably for the best," I agreed. "I need to go down to the R'n'D labs and those aren't exactly places you can follow me." And helping Shikamaru with the clan stuff and, and, so many more things.</p><p>Sasuke huffed. "You'd be surprised," he murmured, but I absolutely didn't want to test my clan defences against his Anbu sneakiness. Whichever outcome that resulted in would be <em> bad.</em></p><p>"Are you still going to come by for dinner?" I asked idly, as we left the hospital.</p><p>Sasuke flicked me an amused look. "I'm going to go home and not talk to anyone for at least twelve hours," he said flatly.</p><p>"Fair." I knew <em> that</em> feeling.</p><p>He hesitated, just half a step, when we came to separate. "You need anything?"</p><p>I shook my head. "Nah. Go home. Good luck on your mission."</p><p>It was odd to be without Sasuke after so long of being side by side, especially in town where people were <em> noticing</em> me in ways they usually didn't. It wasn't the cane – or wasn't just the cane – but some kind of recognition with it. People stepping aside, people glancing my way, hushed whispers just out of hearing distance after I'd walked past.</p><p>The shinobi gossip mill was something incredible, I just wasn't exactly sure what the gossip <em> was.</em></p><p>It made me feel a little exposed, a little paranoid, the muscles between my shoulders pulling tight. I'd have rather just been a faceless part of the crowd. Too much attention was a threat.</p><p>At least in the Nara compound everyone was a known quantity – and busy.</p><p>But I was out of excuses to avoid it, so it was time to buckle up and get back in the game.</p><p>And that meant, firstly, checking in with Shikamaru. Officially. It wasn't that we'd been avoiding each other, but our conversations had been conspicuously lacking in detail and information because I wasn't asking and he wasn't telling. Turned out, when you avoided 'ninja stuff' as a topic, there wasn't actually a lot for two ninja to talk about.</p><p>Shikamaru was in dad's office, hunched over the desk reading a report and tapping a pen against his lips.</p><p>I rapped on the door, leaning against the frame and crossing my arms casually.</p><p>He looked up, slowly, dragging his eyes off the report – the kind of slow response of someone who considered what they were reading more important than what was around them, who knew they were in a place of no danger.</p><p>"Shikako."</p><p>"Hey," I said. "Hospital cleared me. Light duty only, but still. Figured if you were this busy then there was something you could send my way."</p><p>"Oh, so <em> now</em> you want to help?" His voice absolutely didn't manage to conceal the bitterness.</p><p><em> Oh, he was going to do this now?</em></p><p>I checked myself: irritated and tired but okay. I could do this now, even if I didn't want to. I had enough control over myself. I stayed where I was, kept my muscles relaxed and breathing even.</p><p>"Okay," I said, and my voice was miraculously steady. "I wasn't here. And I'm sorry, but sometimes that's going to happen. There's a lot going on and I have to prioritise, and sometimes someone else's problems – or my own problems – are going to come in first. I needed time to heal. And now I've healed, I can prioritise this."</p><p>I wasn't trying to rebuke him, exactly, but this was my position and I wasn't going to move. I didn't feel like it was unreasonable.</p><p>I watched him take in a deep breath and hold it. "There's too many of these for me to deal with," he said, and gestured at the desk, which was a complete and total dodge, but a productive one. Productive because it was something we could <em> do something</em> about<em> .</em> "Can you sort them out?"</p><p>"Sure," I said, easily, and slipped into the room. "What's the current clan situation?"</p><p>The current clan situation, as it turned out, was not so much 'panic' as 'everyone complaining about the workload'. Every new task got at least four 'it can't be done, we're too busy' responses before accommodations were made for it. And solving that was mostly just a matter of finding the right people in charge to talk to.</p><p>Because pretty much everyone except us had done this before. Preparing for war, fighting a war, taking stock and making sure we had enough supplies… it wasn't new to them.</p><p>"- storage scroll production is on track, but they just approved your control and element seals and there's no calligraphers to transcribe them." Shikamaru yawned and slumped back into his chair. "The Academy wants at least enough for the graduation genin – Iruka-sensei approached me and asked about them – but I'm pretty sure orders will go up if we actually, you know, have them."</p><p>I nodded. "I'll drop by and see if I can help," I said, unenthusiastically. I'd rather spend that time working on <em> creating</em> seals, but they wouldn't be any use if they never got made.</p><p>"And then there's the… the ordinary stuff," he said, waving at the other pile. "Routine orders. Taxation changes. I think someone is trying to adopt? I don't know. I haven't had time to look at it." He rubbed his hand over his face, looking pretty overwhelmed and stressed out.</p><p>I surveyed it. It was a lot. And that kind of unfinished workload hung over your head, even without the complicating factors.</p><p>"I'll triage it," I offered. "You keep working on that stuff, it's more urgent. I'll find out what needs to be done here."</p><p>Some of it was easy – the Inuzuka order was their standard, though I had no doubt it would probably increase soon – and some of it could just be sent to someone else to deal with – the taxation changes could be justified or not by the accountants – and some of it was already done and just needed to be approved.</p><p>Side-by-side we chewed through it. It was… interesting, to see Shikamaru like this. Working hard, not because someone was forcing him to, but because it needed to be done. Stepping up, making decisions, wrangling people into place.</p><p>Being <em> reliable.</em></p><p>That was the Shikamaru who was going to be the clan leader.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I hesitated outside the door to the Cryptography office, just a fraction, barely noticeable.</p><p>And then I pushed the door open and strode inside, chin held high. This was a place I needed to be, I couldn't avoid it.</p><p>But stepping inside, the differences were clear immediately. They'd rearranged the whole room. All the desks, some of the bookshelves, the whole inside of the office was radically different.</p><p><em> Clever</em> .</p><p>There was no empty desk, a tribute and unstated memorial, but neither had it been callously reassigned and given to someone else. I still caught myself looking around, that unthinking glance for a familiar face, but there was no glaring reminder of Aoba's absence.</p><p>"Shikako!" Shiho dropped her pen and darted around her desk, catching me in a hug. Her glasses were slightly askew and her hair was frizzing. "Oh, I'm glad you're okay! I heard about what happened! And about Aoba. It's so sad."</p><p>I managed a smile for her, real because of how honest she was. How much suspicion there <em> wasn't</em> in her gaze. Most ninja seemed to know there was more to the story than they were being told, and they didn't like it. Especially here, in the tower, in the heart of the Intelligence Division. "Yeah, it is," I agreed.</p><p>"Are you coming back?" she asked.</p><p>I shook my head. "I'm doing part time in War Ops," I said semi-apologetically. "But we'll probably see each other a lot."</p><p>She nodded. "Oh yeah, we get a lot of communications to code for them."</p><p>I wasn't on roster so there wasn't much for me to do – I cleared out the straggling documents on my desk and checked that nothing had come in for me specifically.</p><p>(There was an old post-it slapped to a pile of forms in my desk drawer, '<em> don't forget to fill these out!'</em> scribbled in Aoba's lopsided handwriting. I smoothed the edges of it down, chest feeling tight, and left it there.)</p><p>In War Operations, Kakashi-sensei waved me over, and then everything kicked into gear. I spend the day analysing feedback, running messages, offering suggestions, and trying to foresee every possible outcome of actions no one had yet to take.</p><p>"What about allies?" I asked, quietly. "What do they think about… the incident in Land of Hot Springs?"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei paused. "Sand and Mist will stand with us but neither of them can field a large force. They have terrain advantage around their village, so neither of them are going to be easy targets and we won't need to provide defenders to help them, but the biggest advantage there is going to be not having to watch our backs."</p><p>If east and west were held by allies, that would limit the directions our attackers could come from. Theoretically. But he was right, both villages were coming off of internal strife and trying to gather their own strength.</p><p>"Rock could go either way. Or rather… they're not going to be our allies. But whether they ally with Cloud… Depends on what kind of deals they work out." He tapped his fingers against the desk. "It's not going to be an <em> easy</em> alliance, and that leaves us with possibilities."</p><p>Possibilities to sabotage them.</p><p>"Then there are the minor villages… Sound is going to be a problem. And with Rice Field Country being so close to Lightning Country… we don't want to end up in a situation with Orochimaru at our back."</p><p>And in all of that, I noticed, he hadn't actually answered my question.</p><p>I let it go.</p><p>"I'll lead a force out, soon." He hesitated. "That'll probably mean that the Jounin Commander will come back."</p><p>"General Hatake, huh?" I asked. Konoha didn't have much in the way of titles and ranks – Jounin, Chunin and Genin was about it – but field commanders in war time were Generals and their orders trumped base or outpost commanders.</p><p>His shoulders went stiff. Like he didn't like the title. He probably didn't. "Something like that."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Kakashi-sensei left and dad came back and things got more busy rather than less. But I was eventually cleared for full duty and got, well, really bored with the consistent cycle of training-paperwork-seal copying. I figured a mission or two would break up the monotony – and shoulder some of the responsibility to the tracking team that I had been largely neglecting.</p><p>But when I went to the mission desk, they had a scroll with my name on it that directed me to the Hokage.</p><p>It wasn't that it was <em> unusual</em> per se; Tsunade had been giving us most of our missions herself for a variety of reasons. But if she'd needed me for a mission, she would have summoned me, not just left a 'when she shows up' message.</p><p>She wasn't available right away but I made an appointment and waited until she was.</p><p>"Shikako," she greeted, pleasantly if not a bit warily. "What brings you here today?"</p><p>I lifted the scroll. "You wanted to see me?"</p><p>Recognition dawned on her face. "Oh yes." She stood from behind her desk and stretched. "This is a conversation that can happen over tea, I think. I've hardly had time for a break all day."</p><p>Well, if that wasn't a subtle reminder that I owed her a great deal for the mess that was currently happening…</p><p>I trailed her out of her office, to a meeting room nearby that was small and cozy. An assistant brought in a teapot and cups and poured them for us. Shizune was in charge of organising and setting up medical field stations and had been gone for some time.</p><p>I tried to sift through the information I had and piece together a conclusion.</p><p>"You aren't going to send me on a mission," I guessed, staring down into my tea. This wasn't a mission briefing. This was trying to soften some kind of bad news, moving from a professional setting to a personal one.</p><p>Tsunade paused and then sighed. "In war time, ninja are contested resources as much as, if not more so, than locations themselves," she explained without really denying it. "Ninja like your year group make terribly tempting targets. You're heirs, with bloodlimits, and strong enough to be threats without being strong enough to be untouchable. If I send you out, every enemy ninja in the vicinity <em> will</em> target you."</p><p>"And keeping us here is wasting those resources," I countered.</p><p>She nodded. "It is. It's a delicate balance to strike. There <em> will</em> be missions for you. But they'll be carefully chosen to avoid as much risk as possible. For now, we have the strength to do that, and I'm not going to play my hand earlier than I have to."</p><p>I thought about asking about Team Gai, already dispatched. I thought about arguing that I could fight – would, willingly, fight the war I'd started – but the way she had worded it meant I wasn't just arguing for myself. I would be arguing to send Ino and Hinata, to send Chouji and Shikamaru and all the others, to war as well.</p><p>"But what do I <em> do</em> then?" I asked, feeling that well of helplessness as an avenue was cut off to me.</p><p>Tsunade arched an eyebrow at me. "You think the work you're doing with Intel and War Ops is unimportant?"</p><p>"Of course not," I agreed, hastily. "But it's not- it's not all I can do."</p><p>She tapped her fingers against the table, thoughtfully. "In about a month, Hidden Mist is holding the Chunin Exams," she revealed. "Anko intends to enter her team into it, and while I agree that they're one of our best options, they are a wild card. None of them have any field experience and that's going to make things… difficult for them."</p><p>Had it been a year since our exams, since I made Special Jounin, already? So much had happened but… it felt wasted. Squandered. A whole year gone, a whole year <em> closer</em> and where was I? How much stronger was I?</p><p>Not enough. Not nearly enough.</p><p>"I could help them with that," I agreed, a little timidly. "If Anko-sempai agrees." It wasn't what I wanted, not by far, but I could take a hint when given to me.</p><p>"You'll be going with me as my escort," Tsunade said. "So, you'll be able to see how they perform. This exam seems like it's going to be … quite an event."</p><p>"Oh?" I asked, a little puzzled.</p><p>"Mm." She sipped her tea. "The Mizukage has timed her wedding to coincide with the end of the exams. An interesting tactic. And of course, we're obliged to present a gift since we'll be attending."</p><p>In terms of PR, there was nothing people loved more than weddings. It <em> did</em> sound very clever. Especially in terms of drawing clients to a place that they wouldn't, historically, have felt very safe and welcome in going. Mei was really going all out.</p><p>"The… Mizukage's wedding?" I repeated, mind sticking a little bit. That was certainly not a thing I had anticipated happening. "To who?"</p><p>Tsunade looked amused. "Zabuza Momochi," she said.</p><p>I stared at her. She didn't appear to be joking. "Well that. Makes sense?" I guessed. It didn't <em> not</em> make sense, anyway. They were both high level figures of the village, who had worked together. I didn't know anything about how they interacted and what the impetus for the wedding really was but at least on the political level it made sense.</p><p>And Mei – who I remembered as never being married and as <em> wanting to</em> – probably wasn't <em> only</em> doing it as a political stunt.</p><p>"You could also complete your medical training," Tsunade suggested, shifting the conversation back on track. "I know you have basic skills and I would <em> much</em> prefer that you have adequate training if you're going to be using them on your fellow shinobi."</p><p>I winced. "I just. I thought something was better than nothing?" And it kind of fell under that very vague 'field shinobi' umbrella of stuff. I'd never claimed to be a fully trained medical ninja when I was offering aid.</p><p>"It is," she agreed. "But there's a reason that the medical program exists and has strict standards. I'll even write you a recommendation myself."</p><p>"Thank you, Tsunade-sama," I said, because what else could I say. "But… I would make a decent medic. Not a great one."</p><p>"One more decent medic is a hundred ninja who don't die," she said. And when put like that…</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>I could never balance the scales – they didn't exist. Even if I knew how many people died, there was no equivalence. Saving one hundred people didn't make up for killing a hundred. Didn't make up for even killing one. Every person was unique.</p><p><em> There is no equivalent exchange for a human life.</em> Hah.</p><p><hr /></p><p>There was one other thing I had been working on that would be helpful – would <em> save lives</em> – if it was implemented.</p><p>My barrier seal.</p><p>So, I called together the Seal Research Group and took them to the training fields.</p><p>"So, a big part of being able to analyse seals is to find out their weak points and how to counter them," I started. "You might be able to get a sample of the seal to examine – which I will supply to you – but for those of you who are combat shinobi, you'll need to be able to do on the fly as well. Luckily, for this example, I'm not going to be actually making you <em> fight</em> against the seal. I'll give you some tags, and then you'll have to come up with weaknesses."</p><p>I handed three seals to each person. "The first one is a traditional Four Corner Sealing Tag," I said. "Each tag is the anchor point and forms the limits of the walls. The second seal is a Barrier Wall – it creates a fixed size square barrier with the tag in the centre. The <em> third</em> is the Barrier Dome." I paused. "It's actually a sphere, but anyway. The tag is placed the central point and it'll form a sphere with a radius of approximately two meters."</p><p>I made a motion at the field. "Go wild."</p><p>I dropped to the sidelines and watched them. Some of them jumped straight to the practical demonstration, some of them went over the seals with a frown and reference book first. That was okay. The more eyes that looked these over, the better.</p><p>Tenten had done a lot of this testing with me, and I'd done a lot of it myself. Even straight off, the SRG was finding the limitations.</p><p>Some of them, actually, had been built into the seal. For starters, the barriers formed <em> around</em> any physical objects in their path. That was the reason why the Barrier Dome was a <em> dome</em> instead of a sphere if you used it at earth level. That had the downside of allowing entry of enemies if they were fast enough, but had the benefit of <em> not amputating your arms</em> if you ended up setting it up wrong. Kind of an important safety mechanism.</p><p>There was also the movement of air – especially for the Barrier Dome – in that it didn't happen. Good for defending against poison gas, bad for having air to breathe.</p><p>I wasn't <em> so </em> worried about the upper strength limit – it would crack, eventually, because everything broke. But it would take a very serious, very severe hit to do so. And even then it would buy you a second which, if you were fighting at that level, was probably what you needed. Or you were dead anyway.</p><p>"The hospital is going to love these," Nanto said, thoughtfully.</p><p>"That's the plan," I agreed. Jiraiya had said as much, back when I had brainstormed the idea with him. That was the impetus for the Barrier Dome, mostly – large enough for a medic and someone lying down to be safely treated. It wasn't fool proof, but it was better than nothing.</p><p><hr /></p><p>They hadn't intended the investigation to cross my desk. But it had been passed back and forth between War Ops and Intel and given that I was in both and had a high enough clearance level to look at it, of course it came to me.</p><p>I took one look at it and froze.</p><p>"Nasty, right?" Said the tired looking Chunin who had been working on it. "Some sick asshole out there."</p><p>A circle. With a triangle inside.</p><p>I swallowed. "Yeah," I agreed, distantly. "I'll. Um. Work on this."</p><p>It took me a long time to read the report, closeted away in a solitary room. The thing was. It wasn't even, actually, knowingly, related to what had happened. No one but me would have ever tied the two together. Or Tsunade, if the right information had made it's way to her desk, and not just a summary.</p><p>What this was, was a list of massacres. Families. Farms. A village. Different places, different people, scattered around the edges of Land of Hot Springs.</p><p>(Not Cloud ninja, War Operations said. Not an intended attack, they said. Possible but unlikely to be an attempt at destroying morale.)</p><p><em> How many people?</em></p><p>And at each of them, a blood painted symbol.</p><p>And at each of them, bodies mutilated and arranged to spell out words.</p><p>Heathen. Infidel. Heretic.</p><p>God-killer.</p><p>Not Cloud ninja, no. Not an attack on morale, no. This was a… a warning. A <em> target.</em> Hidan knew. He <em> knew</em> . And he was going to-</p><p>No. No he didn't <em> know.</em> Not exactly. Jashin had been able to identify me, identify Gelel, but was that enough for his follower to be able to find me? Surely not. Otherwise he would have come after me. Come to Konoha. Not this … display. This was casting a net. This was a taunt. A target in the other direction.</p><p>If anyone knew who was responsible, what would they do with that information in the face of this? And it wasn't… there were rumours. Had been, ever since I'd appeared at the border, covered in blood. How little would it take for him to put that together? To find me, regardless of truth and certainty?</p><p>How could I, knowing what he was doing, ignore this?</p><p>How could I <em> stop him?</em> I couldn't. I wasn't strong enough. That was the whole point.</p><p>And I had thought that this couldn't get worse.</p><p>Numbly, I gathered it all together and took it to Tsunade. She was in the middle of a conversation with dad, but took one look at my white, strained face and took the file.</p><p>"It's him," I said, voice tight. "The symbol is the same. It's. Because."</p><p>She looked at the pictures and didn't flinch. Oh. Oh, she did know.</p><p>"I will deal with this," she said, voice firm and reassuring.</p><p>They weren't our people. It only mattered as intelligence. I wasn't going to leave Konoha. I was defended here, protected.</p><p>I nodded, blindly.</p><p>Dad wrapped an arm around my shoulders. "We should continue this later, Tsunade," he said, and guided me out of the room to his office.</p><p>I folded my arms across my stomach. They weren't shaking. There was no danger here.</p><p>"Was that file the Hekiyuu Massacre?" Dad asked, carefully.</p><p>I nodded. Swallowed. "Yeah. All of them."</p><p>"Pretty rough stuff," he said quietly, squeezing my shoulder. "Did you identify the culprit?"</p><p>I hesitated. It wasn't really a question – obviously, I had. I'd said as much to Tsunade. But it was still classified… or…</p><p>"It's not a Cloud ninja, is it?" he asked, sounding like he guessed the answer to that, too.</p><p>I shook my head. "Missing-nin," I said. "I was looking into him. Before." And dad was the Jounin Commander. He probably did need to know about this. Even if that mission was classified, even if Akatsuki was classified, this wasn't the same thing.</p><p>Probably.</p><p>Either way he kept asking questions, kept gently steering my answers. I didn't know how much I'd told him, kept tripping over my words. Probably too much. I didn't say anything about the explosion, about the seal or the cult, but there was only so many ways to fill the dead air in that story. I thought.</p><p>And… I didn't want to lie to him. It <em> was</em> important that people knew how to fight Hidan, if he was hanging around the border, waiting to see who challenged him. They would need to know what to do – what <em> not</em> to do – to get out alive.</p><p><hr /></p><p>"What?" Sasuke asked, blearily squinting at me.</p><p>Okay, yes. I was breaking into his house at approximately midnight. I just hadn't thought he was back from whatever mysterious Anbu mission he'd been on. There was a tension about him, like he was <em> prepared</em> to launch awake and into action, but was equally prepared to close his eyes and go back to sleep.</p><p>"Sorry," I said, belated. "Kino is crying and I can't sleep. I was going to crash here."</p><p>More than 'I can't sleep' the crying had been driving straight through my brain. I'd tried to use a sound muffling seal to make my room quiet but that had been a mistake. It had been a complete and total mistake. Even with my sensory ability, the absolute silence had only jacked my paranoia up to maximum.</p><p><em> If something happened, you wouldn't hear it.</em> <em> It could be happening right now. You wouldn't know.</em></p><p>And I was achingly tired. I wanted to sleep. I wanted to sleep safely.</p><p>"Whatever," Sasuke sighed, flopping back down on his bed and tucking the kunai away.</p><p>I contemplated the room. There was no couch. I could have pulled my sleeping bag out of hammerspace and slept on the floor. But…</p><p>I curled up next to him, on top of the covers and back to back, and fell asleep.</p><p>"There was actually something I wanted to ask you," I said, in the morning, as we got ready to trek over to the team training grounds.</p><p>Sasuke made a noise to indicate he was listening, sliding his feet into his sandals.</p><p>"How do you go about getting recruited to Anbu?"</p><p>He paused. Flicked a glance at me. "You ask an active duty Anbu how you go about getting recruited," he said, sardonically.</p><p>"Really?" I asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>He shook his head. "Not really. But you get … recommended. It comes down to the Hokage in the end. Why?"</p><p>Not 'why do you want to know' that was obvious. More like 'why Anbu'?</p><p>I shrugged. "I can't take missions as myself," I said, echoing the answer he'd given me a long time ago. "And I… I need to keep fighting."</p><p>"It'll be harder for you," Sasuke said. "The secrecy."</p><p>Because I had family. Because I had people that would ask where I was. I shrugged again. "I'll work it out," I said.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Hot Springs Arc: Chapter 135</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: FFnet has had some problems with notifications recently, so if you haven't been receiving them, make sure to check out chapter 134 if you haven't seen it. And sidestories 20-21.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 135</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get. ~ Dale Carnegie </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Hokage-sama wants to see you."</p><p>I acknowledged and packed my desk up. It wasn't like that was an <em> unusual</em> request, except that I wasn't really involved in anything Hokage-related at the moment.</p><p>I'd taken her up on studying medicine (however lukewarm the actual teachers at the hospital seemed to be about including me. Which was fair enough, no one liked special cases that got special treatment) and was varying my time between War Ops, Intel and the Nara Clan in a pretty random pattern along with, well, everything else I did in my 'free time'.</p><p>Sasuke was right in some ways – I had too many people who would notice if I was gone. I had to lean into that, swing with the momentum, because I couldn't fight it. So yes, there were a lot of people. But they were also people who never expected to have my full time and attention because I had fifty million other places I could be.</p><p>It wasn't fool proof. But it wasn't the worst cover, either.</p><p>So I kinda hoped that this call up was related. I wasn't exactly sure how it was going to go down, but I couldn't actually foresee problems with it. If she'd let Sasuke in, despite being an arguably bigger target, then I should get the anonymity of missions with a white mask, too.</p><p>But it didn't seem like that was what it was about at all.</p><p>"Good, you're here." Tsunade stood from her desk and swung her coat on. "I need you to confirm something related to your last mission. Are you going to be okay with that?"</p><p>"I- Yes, Tsunade-sama," I stammered. <em> Confirm what? </em> My last mission… well, that was obvious, but I couldn't think of anything that was left to confirm about it. <em> Something related to the massacres?</em></p><p>She nodded briskly, accepting that answer, and strode out of the office. I tagged along, confused as to where we were going, but sticking to her heels. We went up, to the open roof of the tower, and I didn't have time to question before Tsunade swept us away in a powerful body flicker that carried us an incredible distance out over the village.</p><p>But the direction was familiar, all the same. Ibiki had taken me out here, once. The T&amp;I prison.</p><p>… <em> what?</em></p><p>Prison meant prisoner. But. That was just as bafflingly incomprehensible. None of the puzzle pieces I had were enough to give me a clear picture of what was going on.</p><p>It didn't help as we entered, either, and my chakra sense picked up on Dad and Inoichi and Ibiki all clustered together.</p><p><em> Dad?</em></p><p>He'd been on a mission. And so had Inoichi. Had he returned and been called in to deal with this already. Or had his mission been about-</p><p>-<em> he'd asked</em> , I thought wildly, the thought blossoming with faint horror. Nothing concrete, nothing certain, just the vague uneasiness of a possibility. <em> He'd asked about Hidan. He'd asked </em> a lot<em> about Hidan.</em></p><p>Had looked at the bloody file. Had seen how shaken I was about it. And then he'd asked.</p><p>My palms were damp. I tucked them into my pockets, unobtrusively, and made myself settle. Dad was <em> here</em> . Obviously. He wasn't hurt. Whatever that was about, I could be sure of that. Everything else was details. And we could work with that.</p><p>One step at a time.</p><p>Tsunade led me through a truly intimidating number of doors and checkpoints, to a room that was so heavily warded I would barely sense anything inside even when I could see it.</p><p>Barely.</p><p>I nodded, distracted, at Dad and circled closer to the window – the two-way-mirror – and studied the decapitated head that was sitting on the interrogation table like that was a perfectly normal thing to have in a room all by itself. Grey hair. Mid-twenties, maybe.</p><p><em> Really. Really? But. How?</em></p><p>It opened it's eyes.</p><p>He. He opened his eyes.</p><p>"I see you," Hidan spat, locking onto me, like he could. He couldn't. Obviously. But Jashin could, or whatever variation on 'see' that a god did, and that wasn't, necessarily, a safer option.</p><p>Dad was there, at my side instantly, hand on my shoulder to pull me back and shadow whirling and pulsing around my feet. For a second, up was down, the night sky was below me, I was falling and standing and tripping and floating, all at once.</p><p>I squeezed his wrist and didn't move, let his chakra become something supporting, something I was part of, rather than something submersing me, something I had to fight off.</p><p>The swooping feeling in my stomach might have been fear, but I could ignore it and pretend it wasn't. How had Hidan's decapitated head got from terrorizing boarder villages to being planted on a Konoha interrogation room table?</p><p>Well. The sequence of events was. Workable. If you ignored the insanity that was someone <em> deliberately</em> setting out to fight an S-rank ninja.</p><p><em> Surely there is a more logical explanation than that?</em></p><p>"Do you think you can escape Jashin-sama?" Hidan demanded. "Do you think this is the end, you stupid fool? As long as there is pain, there will be Jashin! As long as there is death, there will be Jashin! And when <em> you</em> die-"</p><p>I tuned him out. He wasn't saying anything important.</p><p>"You split the body into five parts," I said, tracing the faint threads of chakra, through the overwhelming press of the containment seals. "Limbs and torso, right?"</p><p>Dad squeezed my shoulder again, not relaxing, not retreating. His chakra was the night sky. And there were things that hid in the night.</p><p>Sometimes those things were us.</p><p>I hummed. "They're still… alive. I guess. Connected to him. I don't know if they'd heal, or if he can control them like this, but there's a chance." I glanced at Tsunade. "The other connection is… weaker."</p><p>The connection to Jashin. It wasn't gone, not entirely. But it was so faint, so much weaker than the nightmare world where he had bled through the fabric of the world. So much weaker than the connection that any of those monks had had with him, at that place and time.</p><p>"He's… stronger for it," I said, haltingly, trying to describe the miasma that hovered around Hidan. "Anything that was on this side when the door closed probably went to him. But … the door is closed."</p><p>I didn't look to see if there was any relief on her face, because I was too busy feeling it. The door was closed. Jashin was shut out. Not dead, and not gone forever but… this danger had passed.</p><p>"Do you think the seals will hold him?" She asked, voice neutral.</p><p>I pursed my lips. "I don't know," I said, because it was the only answer I could give. "I can't… I couldn't sense the other type of technique they used, so I don't know if it would have any effect."</p><p>And that would mean that anyone that got too close was in danger. How close was too close? You wouldn't know until it was too late.</p><p>Tsunade sighed, and accepted that. "Inoichi, did you get any preliminary information?"</p><p>"No, Hokage-sama," Inoichi responded. "After… Well. We were aware that there was a mental component to his abilities that had the potential to be devastating. I didn't think it wise to try without protective seals."</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>"Be careful," I said, quietly. "People aren't meant to see the world like that." <em> Throw him in a deep pit and fill it in,</em> I didn't say, because they wouldn't. Not if they had the chance of getting information out of him. <em> It's wrong in ways you don't even know the world can be wrong.</em></p><p>"Hold off, for now," Tsunade said, mouth pulling down unhappily. "See what you can get out of him, Ibiki. And be <em> careful.</em> You have so much as a headache after interacting with him and I want to know about it."</p><p>Ibiki didn't say 'I have a headache right now' even though that would have been, like, the perfect opening for it, and his face communicated it quite clearly.</p><p>"I request Shikako Nara as a consultant," Ibiki said. "He clearly has an… emotive reaction to her."</p><p>"No," Dad said.</p><p>"I'll think about it," Tsunade said.</p><p>I shrugged and looked back out the window. Hidan was still spitting invectives about my impending death and horrific torment. "I don't know if that's very <em> useful</em> information," I said, idly.</p><p>"That's only a matter of asking the right questions," Ibiki said. He didn't grin menacingly, even though that <em> also </em> would have been the perfect opening for it, probably because no one but me would have found it very funny.</p><p>Still. A pity.</p><p>"So, uh," I asked, turning away. "Do I get to know <em> how</em> this happened?"</p><p>Dad shrugged, casually, calmly. "Konoha finally had enough intelligence to send a Hunter-nin squad out after him," he said. "Live capture was prioritized for intelligence gathering, but that didn't exactly make things more complicated." His lips quirked up.</p><p>"Uhuh." I looked at Tsunade. She looked exactly the kind of unimpressed that she got with <em> my</em> team. "Since when are you a hunter-nin?"</p><p>"A good question," Tsunade said, pointedly.</p><p>Dad huffed a laugh. "The Ino-Shika-Cho has always been optimized for prisoner capture," he said. "And your old man still has a few tricks left in him yet. We managed."</p><p>He had. Obviously. The proof was right there. But I would have never <em> chosen</em> to send him out against Hidan. To send any of them. And if I had known before they came back, I didn't think I would have been able to live with the horror of expectation. Of anticipation.</p><p>I stuffed my hands back into my pockets.</p><p>"Guess so," I said, noncommittedly.</p><p>The thing was, without that worry, now that everything was completely over – if it could be said to be completely over – the moment felt … empty.</p><p>It was good that they had captured Hidan. (Probably. Assuming there was no retaliation, assuming this didn't set into motion things I didn't know were coming…)</p><p>It was a good thing. But… after everything that had gone into getting that information...</p><p>Now it was meaningless. A coin that had been spent.</p><p>And it didn't feel like…</p><p><em> Of course it's a good thing,</em> I scolded myself. <em> You saw the photos. He wouldn't have stopped.</em></p><p>He would have kept killing people. And maybe hunting me down, if whatever descriptions Jashin had given him were enough to ever narrow the field – if rumours spread, if people kept thinking 'yes, maybe her' – and I didn't want that.</p><p>I just.</p><p>Didn't know what I wanted.</p><p>"Don't think there won't be a debriefing," Tsunade said, levelling Dad with a flat look. "And a long talk about acceptable risk."</p><p>"Leaving him free would have been an unacceptable risk," Dad said back, as easily as ever. He squeezed my shoulder, again. "Tell your mother I should be home in time for dinner, okay?"</p><p>I knew a dismissal when I heard one. "Will do."</p><p><hr /></p><p>When my introduction to ANBU came, it didn't actually come from Tsunade. Or, I mean,it <em> did</em> , just not directly.</p><p>I got given a mission scroll that was exactly identical to every other mission scroll I'd had, until I opened it. And then it was incredibly suspicious. The inside was basically blank. It had a time and place, an estimated duration of two weeks and that was it. It was signed with the Hokage's signature - chakra signature, even – and that was it.</p><p><em> Right.</em> I tucked it away and tried to pretend it was nothing unusual.</p><p>"I have a mission tomorrow," I said, at dinner that night, because it had occurred to me that my mission cooldown wasn't exactly common knowledge and the best cover was the most obvious one. The only one who would probably see through it was Dad and… well. I didn't think he'd call me on it. "Just a short one, maybe a week or two."</p><p>The location on my mission scroll turned out to be a change-over point pretty much like the one Sasuke had taken me to, way out near the higher number training fields. In one of the drawers there was an ANBU uniform and another scroll – with a new location on it.</p><p><em> Yay, scavenger hunt.</em></p><p>I put on the uniform. I had to admit I appreciated the armour but I wasn't totally in love with the 'covers everything but your armpits' design. Really? Was that necessary? I got that it showed off the ANBU tattoo – or in my case, the lack thereof – but still. Uncomfortably breezy.</p><p>I fidgeted with the long sleeves on the gloves, making sure the straps of the guards were in place and that it covered all my identifying tattoos, and wound my hair up into a bun. Then I affixed the mask which was plain white and more human-like than any I'd seen actual ANBU wear and creepy in its own special way.</p><p>My next point of contact was out in the training fields, so I snuck my way out there, using my chakra sense to make sure no one was around. I felt hyperaware of myself, of the uniform, of how out of place I was. It was strange.</p><p>There was no one at the meeting point – no one within sensing range – so I knelt in a ready position and waited, trying not to let nerves and doubts get the better of me.</p><p>I had experience waiting.</p><p>I wasn't alone for long; four more trainee mask ANBU showed up within minutes. They seemed confident enough but I wondered if any of them had any more idea of what was going on than I did. It made me wonder what the recruitment and attrition rate was for ANBU. Everyone always thought it was high, it was known to be <em> dangerous</em> , but just because everyone knew it didn't make it true. Was five a lot? How frequently did they hold these training camps? How many ANBU were there in total, anyway?</p><p>Then the actual ANBU arrived, two of them body flickering into the training field to stand before us. They were impressively intimidating - silent, chakra tightly leashed and compressed, and seemingly appearing out of nowhere. Pretty much every ghost story you thought about when you thought about ANBU.</p><p>(I'd sensed them coming. But I didn't think anyone else had, no matter how little they reacted.)</p><p>"Welcome to ANBU," said the – possibly female – ANBU, punctuating the statement with an unknown hand signal that I presumed meant 'ANBU', just from context. Her voice was distorted almost mechanically, which was something I hadn't heard used before. "This training is going to be the most physically, mentally and emotionally challenging thing you have ever experienced – until you join ANBU itself."</p><p>"You can leave at any time," said the second – probably male – ANBU. "The course itself is pass/fail. If you make it through, you pass. If you don't, you fail. In that sense, nothing about this training is assessing your suitability to join ANBU – that's already been decided. This is simply the training that makes sure you know what you need once you get there."</p><p>"And there is a lot that you're going to need to know," the first said, switching back seamlessly. "No matter how good you think you are, ANBU is nothing like General Forces. You're about to enter a whole different world. You're going to need to trust your unit without ever seeing their faces or knowing their names. You're going to need to push past any limits you think you have. You're going to need to learn how to operate so far in the shadows that <em> you don't exist."</em></p><p>We were silent.</p><p>"If you don't hate it, then we haven't done our jobs," the second added. "I'm Bull and this is Magpie," he marked the names with representative hand signs.</p><p>"And your training," Magpie said, "starts now."</p><p><hr /></p><p>They were absolutely right.</p><p>I hated it.</p><p>It didn't actually start off too badly – for a given value of 'too badly'. It started with intense physical exercise, but that wasn't exactly unusual. More intense than I would have done daily by myself, but if they were aiming for physical exhaustion then it wasn't exactly surprising.</p><p>I… held back.</p><p>Or… not exactly. That wouldn't have gone over well. But I wasn't going to make the same mistake I'd made fighting Gaara, exhausting myself just because I thought it was <em> safe</em> . So, I didn't use my chakra, smashed that impulse down and relied on pure physical conditioning to see me through. It made me struggle and lag behind the others but not so badly that I would fail out. And it meant that I could choose to use my chakra in small doses to recover between activities, healing up and being ready for the next task.</p><p>We'd started early in the morning and lunch came and went without a break and dinner came and went without a break. Nightfall came and went.</p><p>No one was stupid enough to believe that was an oversight. This was going to be a long, hard slog in a lot of ways.</p><p>It wasn't just physical training though. They were also teaching us the ANBU sign language, mostly by demonstrating a sign alongside a verbal instruction once and expecting it to be remembered. Which was slightly difficult when one was upside down doing a hundred hanging sit ups off a tree branch. As the day went on, the verbal instructions grew less and the non-verbal ones took over.</p><p><em> The first time someone misses one is not going to be fun</em> .</p><p>In that, at least, we had safety in numbers. Until they started giving us individual instructions, anyway.</p><p>When we did stop for the night, hunger was a real and clawing thing in my insides. We made camp, to the strict instructions of the ANBU trainers, a perfectly invisible, defensible site that we could disassemble and move out from within minutes – which I knew, because they made us do it until we could do it to standard. The rations they gave us afterwards <em> technically</em> had the caloric content to see us through, but between the long hours and the strenuous exercise, it wasn't going to be easy.</p><p>"This," Magpie said, dropping a thin book on each of us, "is greatest manual you're ever going to have. Read it. Learn it. Love it. Tomorrow we'll cover chapters one and two – I suggest you come prepared."</p><p>"Your wake-up call will be in three and a half hours," Bull added, almost cheerfully. "Sleep tight."</p><p>They left, <em> actually </em> left or at least far enough that I couldn't sense them.</p><p>One of the other trainees groaned, slumping down on the ground. "Read it in the morning," he suggested.</p><p>I arched an eyebrow. Obviously, with the mask on it was less effective. "You think they'll give you time?" I asked, pitching my voice low and feeling a bit weird about it. Was it entirely necessary? I had no idea. This secret identity business was hard.</p><p>He exhaled, noisily. "Fuck."</p><p>Yeah, I didn't think so either. There was a pretty strong chance our 'wake-up call' would come a lot sooner than expected, even. That seemed like a thing they would do.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Hot Springs Arc: Chapter 136</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 136</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> You cannot step into the same river twice. ~ Heraclitus </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>You had to give ANBU something.</p><p>When they tried to make the worst two weeks of your life happen, they happened.</p><p>"If an ANBU is <em> seen</em> ," Magpie told us, "they have already <em> failed.</em> An ANBU mission leaves no witnesses behind, because <em> it did not happen.</em> "</p><p>The foot on my back pressed me down into the ground, mud squelching the side of my mask. My breath hissed out into my mask, moist air hanging trapped and full of the unpleasant sour tang of ketosis.</p><p>The foot lifted, Bull stepping back and fading into the trees. I tried to follow how he'd done it, the tricks to the visual concealment technique that they were teaching us, but another demonstration didn't give me any more information than I'd had a minute ago.</p><p>I tucked my arms beneath my chest and pushed myself to my knees. They trembled. It was tempting to heal them, to recover <em> more</em> before trying to push myself onwards, but I didn't dare. Chakra was a precious resource now we'd started <em> using</em> it – with no sleep and few meals it was hard to recover – and I didn't want to risk running low.</p><p><em> Focus</em> , I told myself. But it was so goddamn hard. I just… I wanted to sleep. I wanted to go home. I wanted to stop.</p><p>Was this worth it? It was just <em> training</em> . No one was going to die if I didn't get this right.</p><p>To my left, another trainee pitched forward, concealment technique breaking as Bull swept his legs out from underneath him, appearing the instant the jutsu faltered in the slightest.</p><p>"You just compromised your mission!" Magpie said.</p><p><em> Conceal, don't feel</em> , I thought and hiccupped because I was too tired to laugh. I pushed myself back to my feet. Chakra suppression, easy. Scent blocking, doable. Visual concealment…</p><p>I layered the chakra and faded into the shadows.</p><p>Or not into the shadows because I could have done <em> that.</em> Not quite a genjutsu but not quite a ninjutsu but not quite Hiding With Camouflage Jutsu, this visual erasure was one of ANBU's cornerstones and signature moves. You could stand in a room with a dozen ANBU under this and never know. Theoretically.</p><p>I moved cautiously inching one foot forward. My technique held.</p><p>Then. Of course. It started to rain and we all became instantly visible.</p><p>"Pathetic!" Magpie bellowed.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I dodged a wave of kunai, landing sideways on a tree and twisting through the projectiles – sluggish, but not slow enough to be hit. My attacker moved, position given away by pinpointing the direction they'd been thrown from, and tree leaves rustled as they relocated through the branches.</p><p>I would have noticed that, even if I hadn't been able to sense their chakra. The other ANBU, trainees and trainers both, honed in on it taking the heat off me for a minute that I tried to exploit to recover.</p><p>The downside to being a sensor, it turned out, was that once the trainers had noticed how unfairly well I was handling ANBU-grade hide and seek, I became target number one, with plenty of handicaps to try and trip me up. At this point, I suspected, it was a pride thing, and they were just <em> waiting</em> for me to make that single, fatal mistake.</p><p>I was damp with sweat, unpleasantly soaked, and my scent blocking technique was keeping it grossly contained near my skin instead of splattering off and littering the ground with 'here I am' signals. I was breathing heavily into my mask's sound muffling and my heart was thundering so loudly I was surprised people couldn't hear it outside my body.</p><p>I inched another step closer to the flag I was supposed to be capturing and that everyone else was supposed to be keeping from me. <em> Eyes on the prize.</em> Magpie's chakra was humming and suppressed and <em> right next to it.</em></p><p><em> Go left</em> . I circled sideways, careful not to stir any of the foliage around us, moving so slowly and cautiously that I left no mark and made no sound. My fingers lifted, reached out, brushed the fabric of the flag-</p><p>-and snapped back painfully.</p><p>"Nice try," Magpie said, sending a pulse of chakra down my wrist that shattered the concealment technique I was hiding in.</p><p>I groaned and dropped to my knees, hand twisting painfully.</p><p>The rest of the group swarmed around us, some more visible than others.</p><p>"You know what gave you away?" Magpie asked, almost conversationally.</p><p>I swallowed, mouth and throat painfully, painfully dry. I thought longingly of the canteen (and food!) I had tucked away in hammerspace – but with no privacy to access it or drink, it was useless.</p><p>"Air currents," I guessed. Or… "Vibrations." Silent stepping didn't negate all the possibility of giving yourself away walking, if Magpie was an earth type they might have been able to feel such tiny impressions.</p><p>"Close," they said, lifting their hand off of my hand and holding it inches from my arm. "You're sweating."</p><p>I was blocking that-</p><p>"Heat," I sighed. You sweated to lose heat via evaporation. But you also radiated it out – the human body at peak exercise produced far more heat than it could handle and of <em> course</em> someone could notice that.</p><p>"Well, you did touch the flag," Bull said, voice thoughtful in a way that meant nothing good for us. "I guess you just won the team a whole new lesson."</p><p>None of the other trainees groaned, but it was probably because none of us had the energy for it.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Once we had the ANBU stealth down, we segued into ANBU style mission tactics.</p><p>At first, it was just theory – Magpie and Bull switched from drilling us on the code to throwing scenarios at us and getting us to sound out an attack strategy where anything that even remotely blew our cover was an automatic failure – and the break from terribly punishing physical exercise was a godsend.</p><p>Then things became not-so-theoretical which I felt like something we should have seen coming a long way off. There was no way to mock up a full mission, but there were definitely ways to simulate the feeling of running to Lightning Country, dodging border patrols, gathering intel, and identifying targets without ever letting our guards down or stopping to rest.</p><p>Two weeks of training sounded <em> a lot</em> longer when you realized that it was three hundred and thirty-six hours and that they meant to use <em> all of it.</em></p><p>It wasn't that ANBU didn't sleep on missions, necessarily, but every minute you were in enemy territory was another minute you could be discovered and we were modelling worst case scenarios.</p><p>As demonstrated by the <em> actual ANBU team</em> that our trainers so kindly summoned on the last two days of our training, who hunted us all over multiple training fields. We weren't supposed to <em> fight</em> them, which would have at least dealt with the issue one way or another, though we did clash several times before managing to wiggle our way into evasion. Which felt, honestly, more like they were toying with us.</p><p>And then, just when I tilted off the knife edge balance of exhaustion and irritability… it was over.</p><p>"Congratulations," Magpie said, sounding softer than at pretty much any other point during the training. "You made it through. This training is not easy – it is designed to test you and push you to your limits. To give you the very <em> smallest</em> taste of what is going to happen if you continue on. How you feel right now? That is going to be your life."</p><p>I breathed in and out. Sweat was drying on my skin. My muscles were shaking. I was exhausted and hungry and a little dehydrated. I could use about a week of sleep.</p><p>But I wasn't <em> hurt.</em> I wasn't dying. No one around me was. The world wasn't about to end.</p><p>This? I could do this for the rest of my life.</p><p>"Once you take a ANBU mission," Bull said, picking up the thread, "your team is on their own. There will be no backup. If you get caught, Konoha will disavow all knowledge of your mission. There will be no rescue. Every time you leave the village may very well be the last. And you will never, ever be able to talk about what happens when you're wearing the mask."</p><p>All this had been in stark black and white in the ANBU code, but it sounded more serious now, said in quiet voices as it was about to become our reality. But how many missions had we ever had backup on, anyway? Once, with the Sound Four? And we'd been in the right time and place to provide it in Kubisake pass to a team that had never had the chance to request it.</p><p>Maybe it <em> was</em> different. Maybe not being able to talk to anyone – not allies, not outposts, not civilians along the way – would make missions more dangerous and challenging. Maybe. But I couldn't know that without having done it and on the surface it didn't sound so different.</p><p>"So, on that note," Magpie went on. "You have one last chance to turn aside. At five pm tomorrow there will be a swearing in ceremony with the Hokage, where you will receive your masks and team assignments. If you do not show up, we will know what your answer is."</p><p>And that was that. They led us to a dilapidated dojo on the edge of the training fields – one with boarded up windows that had never seen usage in my lifetime – that turned out to have a basement level locker room. With showers.</p><p>Sweet heaven.</p><p>Not that I'd never gone home covered in mission grime, but it was going to be so much harder to pretend that it'd been a nothing-interesting mission if I looked like I had been dragged backwards through a mountain.</p><p>Luckily for me, Shikamaru was out on a mission of his own.</p><p>"Good mission?" Mum asked, looking up from feeding Kino.</p><p>I yawned. "Tiring," I admitted, because it was really hitting me now. "Is there food? I want to eat everything and then sleep until my debriefing tomorrow."</p><p>She laughed and gestured at the kitchen. I assembled dinner and contemplated never, ever getting this hungry again. Maybe if I just made a food-only hammerspace <em> directly in my mouth.</em> As long as I could parcel it out by mouthfuls… maybe just liquid protein shakes…</p><p>I sank heavily down on the couch and listened to Kino babbling away. That was new. "Aren't you a little chatterbox?"</p><p>"More so than either of you were," Mum agreed. She grabbed one of his waving fists and kissed it. "He's started rolling, too, so be careful where you step. Yes, you have!"</p><p>"Escape artist, huh?" I yawned, and then had to force my eyes back open afterwards. My bowl of food tilted dangerously in my hand until I righted it. "Okay, I'm going to go do the sleep thing."</p><p>Sleep was good. Kino could have cried from dusk to dawn and I wouldn't have budged an inch. (That was a lie. I was entirely too prepared to be woken up by a sneak attack in the middle of the night. 'Training is over' seemed like one of those lies that Kakashi-sensei would tell. It didn't happen, though.)</p><p>Meeting at five had sounded excellent when I'd heard it, but now it just meant I had a whole day to prepare and anticipate and watch the clock so that I didn't even remotely run late.</p><p>I swung by the hospital to see what I'd missed in the medical classes, and that was a disaster and a half all on its own. Whatever reasons they had for not liking my presence in their classes was not helped by my lack of presence in their classes. I couldn't win. I could find out what we'd covered, but no one wanted to reschedule the practical parts, no tutors were free <em> ever</em> , and all the other students were paired off for the groupwork stuff.</p><p>Joy. I had half a mind to just throw the towel in on it all, but Tsunade had personally suggested I do it and I did, in fact, have clan resources to fall back on. Which was how I'd done as much medical training as I already <em> had</em> .</p><p>Clans ruled, basically.</p><p>And then it was four o'clock so I made my way to the changing station and dressed in the ANBU blacks that had been left for me with the same blank trainee mask. I felt the same nervous anticipation that I had when putting the mask on for the first time.</p><p>I was perfectly punctual, arriving slightly early. Two other trainees were already there, and the fourth arrived slightly after me. The fifth didn't. Our two trainers showed up and I thought that was it – and then the last trainee slid briskly into the clearing.</p><p>Magpie tilted their mask sideways towards Bull. "Told you," they said. "All five made it."</p><p>The larger ANBU grumbled slightly. "Alright, you win."</p><p>It would have been easy to be angry at the two of them, to hate them, since they'd been the ones running us into the ground. But they'd also been there every step of the way with us and that wasn't an easy task either. They'd suffered the lack of sleep and food too.</p><p>They led us to the roof of the Hokage Tower with a body flicker, then down the stairs to the Hokage's office. We ghosted past a group of chunin that didn't even <em> blink</em> at our passing.</p><p>I could get to like this 'invisible' thing.</p><p>There were six other ANBU-technique-muffled chakra signatures in Tsunade's office – one of which I would always recognize. I was therefore totally unsurprised to see the 'honor guard' around her desk when we walked in, though at least one of the other trainees faltered. They were an intimidating bunch, granted but the sight of the gleaming Hawk mask was only reassuring. The ANBU directly to the right of the Hokage was dressed in a white cloak, standing out shockingly compared to the black of all the rest.</p><p><em> Rank thing?</em> It was probably a rank thing.</p><p>We came to kneel in the center of the room, one knee down, arms folded in a double block across our chests in the most formal Konoha salute.</p><p>"ANBU," Tsunade greeted, nodding gravely at us, with no distinction for those of us who were only trainees. Though I guessed that meant there was no distinction, anymore. "My congratulations. Your trainers have informed me that you were exceptional during training, displaying skill and courage and endurance that cannot be faulted. They recommended I induct you into ANBU without reservation. I do not doubt them."</p><p>Was that a normal recommendation? Surely it was, something they said about every group. But it <em> felt</em> like it held weight. I couldn't stop the little swell of pride that bloomed warm in my chest.</p><p>"Are you prepared?" she asked.</p><p>The silence was so thick and heavy in the room you could have cut it with a kunai.</p><p>"Yes, Hokage-sama!"</p><p>The ANBU in white stepped forward. "I am Zou," he said, though his mask didn't look exactly elephantine. "The Commander of the ANBU division. <em> Your</em> commander. The Ansatsu Senjutsu Tokushu Butai is the most elite and classified division of Konoha… and the most dangerous. We are known as the Hokage's private soldiers and it is true - to become part of ANBU your loyalty to the Hokage must be <em> absolute.</em> Not to the village, or to your family or clan or friends. But to the Hokage first and only."</p><p>There was silence. He waited a long, long moment. Maybe for a reaction, maybe for an objection.</p><p>"From here on out," he went on, when there was none, "your mask will be your identity. The actions you take to serve the village will never be known. You will operate only under the veil of utmost secrecy. If you die on a mission, no one will ever know how. They may not even know you have died at all. Think very carefully about whether this is a reality that you can tolerate. Your last chance to withdraw is now."</p><p>He stepped back.</p><p>Not one of us moved.</p><p>Tsunade looked at us, seeming to meet each of our eyes through the masks. Of all the people in the room, she would be the only one to know who we each were.</p><p>She seemed satisfied. "Then swear your oaths."</p><p>"I solemnly swear," I said, echoed by the other four trainees in a rumbling unison, "to be loyal to the Hokage above all else, to execute the orders given to me faithfully and without question and to use the best of my ability, knowledge and judgment perform my duties."</p><p>Well 'without question' might have been asking a bit much.</p><p>"Stand," Tsunade ordered, and made us all step back. It became clear why, when Magpie fetched a giant scroll, of the massive tall ones that were mostly used for medical seals, and spread it out where we had been kneeling. The seal on it did not look like a medical seal at all and I started picking out the purpose of it.</p><p>Signal. Identify. Alert.</p><p>Ah. The ANBU tattoo. There were four other scrolls leaning against the walls.</p><p>I watched avidly as it was applied to the first three trainees, the ink writhing off the page and onto them to form a spiral, leaving only blank paper behind. It was complex and complicated, and delicate at the same time, twisting into their chakra systems fluidly and with many hooks.</p><p>Then it was my turn.</p><p>I knelt in the middle of the seal and squashed my apprehension. I'd known this was coming.</p><p>Tsunade paused, just a fraction, and met my eyes.</p><p>Then she activated the seal.</p><p>It was white hot like fire creeping over my skin. Not fire. Burning metal. Searing, carving. My breath caught, my teeth slammed shut like a vice, every muscle in my body went tense.</p><p>And I didn't fight it.</p><p>The seal hooked into my chakra network, a thousand tiny catches, like little needles, like Velcro hooks. It pulled, sideways, dragged with such a pull that I thought my sense of gravity had shifted, becoming a solid and heavy mass on my shoulder.</p><p>Then it settled. The pain faded away. The hooks remained, the seal remained. I tried to remember how to breathe again. No one seemed to have noticed anything had happened.</p><p>I stepped off the paper. Got back into line. Waited for the fifth and final person to be sealed, and tried to not be too obvious while I examined the seal on my arm. There was the faintest of ties, linking back to Tsunade.</p><p>Just because she set it? No, there was a … signal. That made sense. She could summon her ANBU through the seal. And there was a reflection… a way to detect other ANBU seals.</p><p>I had <em> better</em> be able to hide that. Either naturally, or with another seal… surely there was. I was far from the only paranoid ninja in Konoha, let alone ANBU. Something that identifiable was just asking for trouble.</p><p>There was something deeper, too. Some gathering bundle of chakra beneath the seal. A last resort technique? A dead mans trap? It was ringed with a whole lot of qualifiers and stop gaps, whatever it was.</p><p>Tsunade finished sealing her last victim and stood.</p><p>"Your ANBU tattoos are your pass keys into classified, ANBU-only areas. I'll leave it to your captains to explain how. They also," she formed a half seal with one hand, "allow me to summon you when your presence is required, individually or as a whole."</p><p>On my arm, the seal grew warm, like I was standing a little too close to something hot but not actually touching it. It was very, very noticeable but not <em> quite</em> painful.</p><p>"When this happens, report to me directly and be ready to take a mission immediately. More routine and less time critical summons will be distributed by hawk and through ANBU headquarters."</p><p>There was a flicker, like stars bursting into light – 6 of them, specifically, on the shoulders of the ANBU in front of us.</p><p>"They also," Tsunade went on, "have a signaling function so that you can identify each other and prevent infiltrators in your ranks."</p><p>"And lastly," Zou said, "if an ANBU falls in battle, their comrades may use the Body Destruction function of the seal to cremate them and prevent them from falling into enemy hands."</p><p><em> Yeah, no, that has to go</em> , I decided. I didn't like the idea of a seal that someone <em> else</em> could activate on my body. Even if the limiters on the seal made it impossible to activate while there were life signs attached.</p><p>It seemed like Zou had very effectively killed the mood in the room, though. Someone that one statement had made everything more serious than every warning of how dangerous ANBU was that had come before it. Maybe how matter-of-fact he was about it, like it was definitely something that had happened before and would happen again.</p><p>"And now," Tsunade said, just a little dryly, "your captains."</p><p>Oh. So <em> that </em> was why the other ANBU were here. I was a little surprised... but Sasuke had been in ANBU for nearly a year now. It didn't seem so unlikely that he would have been promoted to a leadership position. And that meant I was about ninety percent sure as to who my captain was. It <em> better</em> be. Otherwise that was just cruel. And dumb. And a lot of other things.</p><p>The first three were assigned. I stepped forward.</p><p>"Hawk," Tsunade said, lips twitching into an amused smile for just a fraction of a second.</p><p>Sasuke stepped forward. <em> Follow</em> he signed with ANBU hand signs.</p><p><em> Affirmative</em> , I signed back and wondered how long it would take him to notice. I wasn't so obvious this time as I had been last time, scars covered and identifying coloured nail polish removed. I gave it until … the first time he turned on his sharingan or I spoke, whichever came first.</p><p>Sasuke lead me out onto the roof of the Hokage tower and then towards the mountain. We slipped in through a set of tunnels that I had never been in before but that seemed half finished and unused. Which was an impression that held right up until the first checkpoint and its massively reinforced door.</p><p><em> Observe</em> , Sasuke signed at me, and ran through a set of handseals to deactivate the wards and open the door. The chakra on his ANBU tattoo pulsed and resonated at <em> just</em> the right frequency.</p><p>I felt the shiver of the wards as we stepped through. And he repeated the process in reverse on the other side to close it behind us.</p><p>On this side the tunnels were far better constructed. They could have been any hallway in the tower, in fact. It was mildly disorientating.</p><p>Also it made me wonder just how close we had come to ANBU HQ when we had been running around up here chasing the trap master Genno. It couldn't have been <em> too</em> close or things would have gone in a very different direction.</p><p>"There are several entry points into Headquarters," Sasuke said, voice only a little distorted by the mask. "This is entrance seven, designated for small, non-urgent groups. The entrance code changes on a randomized basis and you'll receive the new code from your captain. Which is me."</p><p><em> Affirmative</em> , I signed again.</p><p>With the mask on, it was impossible to tell if I was winding him up or not or if this was just standard and expected newbie behavior.</p><p>Sasuke gave me a very brief tour of the place, which was mostly just a function of which parts we crossed on our journey to wherever we were going.</p><p>Which turned out to be a stock room. Or quartermaster. Or… armory. Whatever they called it here.</p><p>"Kawauso! New recruit for you!" Sasuke called.</p><p>A grim faced middle-aged man limped out into the open, waving a hand. "Yeah, yeah, I know what day it is. The others have been and gone, what'd you do, take the scenic route?" He dismissed Sasuke at a glance and focused on me. "Well, what are you waiting for, babyface. Step up."</p><p>I stepped up.</p><p>He huffed. "Do the recruits get smaller each year or what? Next you'll have me making blacks for babies. Then again, there've been a few…" He trailed off, grumbling to himself, but starting to fetch things off the shelves, seemingly without thought and dropping them onto the counter near the door. Several sets of black pants and shirts, another white chest plate, more forearm protectors, a kunai pouch and holster, sword, a first aid kit, a sewing kit, a field rucksack that seemed liked it was packed already… the pile kept growing. He made me try on another set of boots, adjusted sizing's until he was happy with the fit.</p><p>Then he turned to the wall of masks hanging ominously to the side. "Got any special requests for a mask?" he asked, teeth gleaming in a smile.</p><p>It was a test, of course it was. I wasn't sure <em> what</em> it was testing yet, but I was absolutely sure there was a catch.</p><p>Maybe to see whether I would give my identity away. Or something.</p><p>But really, there was only one answer I could give.</p><p>"Bat," I said, trying to copy the voice distortion technique Magpie had been using. It… didn't really work, sounding more like I'd been eating gravel than anything else. Which, I guessed, was thematically appropriate.</p><p>Kawauso tilted his head, eyes narrowing as he considered.</p><p>Bats <em> were</em> associated with the Nara clan, though not specifically with <em> Shikako</em> Nara. If I ever ended up using Shadow Jutsu – and I could hardly see myself managing a whole career where I didn't at some point – then that was going to be a greater give away anyway.</p><p>But that really wasn't the point. There was no one in this world that would understand the logic behind my choice.</p><p>And that logic was this: be yourself, unless given the chance, then <em> always</em> be Batman.</p><p>"That's not in circulation at the moment," he said by way of agreement, standing and fetching one down off the pegs on the wall. It was very stylized, but yes, pointy triangular ears, protruding snout, and fangs. That did kinda look like a bat.</p><p>I held it in hand awkwardly. There was no particularly easy way to switch masks without anyone seeing and… well. That would be a great start to the whole secret identity thing.</p><p>Kawauso jerked a thumb over his shoulder, towards the small cubicle in the corner of the room. "Changing room," he said. "Go put it on, babyface. You're embarrassing your captain with that thing."</p><p>I did as I was told, slinking into the very small and cramped cubicle. It was better than nothing. There was a small, slightly blurry mirror affixed to the back wall.</p><p><em> Hmm.</em> I took out my bun and split my hair into two sections, wrapping them up into slightly conical odango style hair buns just behind the ears of the mask. <em> Utterly ridiculous. Perfect.</em></p><p>I bounced out of the changing room. There was a very faint snort that sounded like it had come from the direction of my captain.</p><p>Kawauso didn't even pretend to hide his. "Great, now sign here," he tapped a pen against a standard form had been pre-filled out and now held my mask identification. "You're responsible for upkeep and minor maintenance; hence the sewing kit. It gets wrecked or irreparably stained; bring it back to me and I'll replace it but you have to do your own paperwork next time."</p><p><em> Affirmative</em> , I signed and affixed as much of the <em> stuff</em> to my person as I could – sword and kunai pouches and kits – and gathered the rest of it up. Sasuke did not even remotely offer to help, just lead the way further into the headquarters. I hoped we were actually going to stop somewhere, or I would have tried to seal it all away.</p><p>It turned out our next stop was the barracks.</p><p>"Every team gets a sleeping quarters," Sasuke said, pushing open the door. There were two sets of bunk beds in a long narrow room, with four locked chests, and a single desk next to the door. "None of us are here full time; we all have living arrangements in the village, but if you need a place to crash between briefings and missions or… for whatever reason, it's here."</p><p>He identified which chest was mine and demonstrated the chakra key to open it. I made a mental note to come back and clean out my stuff into hammerspace when no one was watching me.</p><p>"Now, we're going to go meet our teammates."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Land of Hot Springs Arc: Chapter 137</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: I located all the storyline scenes for Komachi and Towa from Clash of Ninja 2 Revolution and posted them on youtube, if people are wondering who they are.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 137</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. ~ H. Jackson Brown, Jr.</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The rest of the team was waiting for us on one of the training fields on top of the mountain itself.</p><p>Technically the mountain wasn't a secure site – the viewing platform out over the Hokage Heads was a popular spot and there were a couple of administrative buildings up here – but it was also out of the way because it was <em> at the top of the mountain</em> and people didn't tend to go there without cause. And the training fields were all fenced off and stamped with 'danger' signs, like the Forest of Death had been.</p><p>Whether that was a bluff or not was yet to be seen.</p><p>"Taicho!" Two ANBU appeared suddenly in front of us and I was once again glad for my sensing ability because it meant I'd had warning and didn't jump.</p><p>I eyed them critically but neither seemed familiar to me.</p><p>"So, what was the big meeting all about?" One asked. He was reasonably muscular with dark silver hair in a lopsided ponytail, a bird mask, and a <em> fascinating</em> red seal wrapped around his right bicep.</p><p>"We got a rookie," the second one guessed, sounding a little amused. She was a little taller than me, but not by much, with long, dark blonde hair held back with hair sticks – no, they were senbon holders – and a cat mask with delicate red arcs.</p><p>"We got a rookie," Sasuke confirmed. "This is Bat. Bat, this is Towa and Komachi."</p><p>"Yes," Komachi said, as if answering an unasked question. "Those are our call signs. There are about twenty people running around with cat masks, so even if you take into account Tiger and Lion and so on, there's still a shortage of names to masks."</p><p>"If you look at it that way," Towa added on, "those of you with animal call signs are really in the minority."</p><p>"Yes, thank you," Sasuke said, repressively, like he had definitely heard that before.</p><p>Well. That was something I hadn't thought to wonder about. Then again, where <em> had</em> the assumption of animal-code-names come from? I had no idea. It was just a thing people <em> knew</em> , which was very suspect when talking about a division that no one really knew anything about.</p><p>"Bat is a sabotage specialist," Sasuke said.</p><p>There'd been a lot of testing during training for them to come to that conclusion and I <em> still</em> wasn't quite sure how they'd reached it. Better than labelling me a sensory specialist, though, because that would have narrowed my possible identity down substantially.</p><p>"Are we being re-speced, taicho?" Komachi asked. She seemed relaxed enough, maybe intrigued. "I thought we were being slotted into a defensive specialization."</p><p>"I wouldn't worry about it yet," Sasuke said. "But if we are, we can handle it."</p><p>I wanted to ask what their current specialization was then, but I knew that Sasuke at least had been on patrol and guard-the-hokage-house duty recently.</p><p>"So, this is Red Team," Sasuke said, sliding back into introductions mode. "We might pick up a fifth squad member if we need one on missions, but the four of us are the core of the squad. We aren't currently rostered on to patrol and I have a solo mission coming up, so we'll have plenty of time to train together before we're sent out."</p><p>"We'll take good care of our rookie while you're gone, taicho," Towa said, voice calm and sincere. I was instantly suspicious.</p><p>Sasuke snorted. "I bet." He ran a hand through his hair. "Okay, so Red Team is a masks-on squad. All the time, no exceptions. If you want to take your mask off in HQ, I can't stop you but I recommend against it. And if other people are removing their masks and you identify them, that isn't an invitation to make use of that knowledge."</p><p>I signed <em> Affirmative</em> .</p><p>"You <em> can</em> talk, you know," he said, mask tilting to the side. "You don't need to take the secrecy that far."</p><p>I paused. Then signed <em> Affirmative</em> again.</p><p>I could absolutely imagine the pinched, exasperated look on his face.</p><p>Sasuke crossed his arms. "What else?" he muttered, more to himself. "Oh, yeah." He fixed me with what would have been a solid stare and just ended up being a blank mask face. "I don't care what kind of rumors you heard about suicide missions. You did <em> not</em> come here to die."</p><p>I blinked beneath my mask, actually startled for a second. That was not just his serious voice, it was <em> fierce</em> . Was this an issue that came up a lot? Was I emitting some kind of 'seriously unhinged ninja' vibes?</p><p><em> Affirmative</em> , I signed.</p><p>The silence stretched uncomfortably. I wondered if I was dragging this joke out too long – should I just speak and give it away? Sasuke's reaction was going to be pretty funny either way…</p><p>"Shall we begin with teamwork exercises?" Komachi asked. "The training field is ours for another hour."</p><p>Sasuke considered. "I want to spar with her first," he decided. "Get a baseline idea of where her skills are at. Bat, are you injured from testing?"</p><p><em> Negative</em> , I signed.</p><p>He tilted his head. "Then get out here." I was pretty sure he was smirking under the mask.</p><p>Yeah, well, so was I.</p><p>There was no way Sasuke <em> wasn't</em> going to recognise my fighting style, even if I didn't use seals, shadow jutsu or anything more 'me', especially if he was smart and used his sharingan. There was the Taijutsu style I used, the moves we'd all seen and incorporated over our careers, any personal ticks I had…</p><p>So, with that in mind, the instant that the spar started, I flickered in with Lee's Leaf Hurricane, swept his legs out from underneath him and booted him into the air.</p><p>I didn't follow up with the Shadow of the Dancing Leaf because I wasn't an <em> idiot</em> and he was already turning in the air, more than familiar with this style of attack. I flickered away, instead, pulling on my new stealth training to try fade out and come in from an unexpected angle.</p><p>The sharingan was an exceptional combat tool, but it had to see you coming in order to be useful.</p><p>It partially worked and partially didn't, but either way it was a new element to keep things interesting.</p><p>And when the fight was over…</p><p>"You," Sasuke declared, voice tight, "are <em> the worst.</em> "</p><p>I laughed. <em> Affirmative.</em></p><p>"Don't <em> affirmative</em> me," he said, stalking over and smacking me on the arm, right over my ANBU tattoo. Yep, he knew, alright.</p><p>"Took you long enough," I teased. "Were you just not used to seeing me with such massive amounts of uncovered skin?" I gestured vaguely towards my shoulders. I mean, area wise, covering a face probably made up for not covering shoulders but otherwise this probably <em> was</em> the most revealing outfit I'd worn. And given the differences in silhouette between wearing a jacket and the increase in bulk muscle from serious physical training… I probably did look a bit different at a glance.</p><p>"Were you planning on just not saying anything the whole time?" Sasuke grumbled.</p><p>"Nah," I said. "I figured I'd get bored with it in a couple of hours. That or I'd keep trying the voice modulation jutsu until I got it right."</p><p>"The <em> worst</em> ," he repeated, severely. "And since when are you a Sabotage Specialist?"</p><p>"It's the official terminology for 'ruins everything I touch'," I shot back. "So. Always."</p><p>"You two know each other?" Komachi asked. The two of them seemed more interested than they had been while watching us spar, which had been treated with a detached professional air.</p><p>Sasuke hesitated. "This is a masks-on squad," he said. "Who we are underneath them doesn't matter." He turned to me. "Right now, I'm Hawk, your squad captain, and you need to listen to my orders."</p><p>I sketched a salute. "Yes, taicho."</p><p>He rolled his shoulders back, as if stretching out the kinks. "Right. Now, team training-"</p><p>Given the restrictions of secrecy and not being able to do 'get to know each other' stuff, team training was, by necessity, heavily physical. I was okay with that. We laid out a training plan that seemed to include a lot of the teamwork exercises Kakashi-sensei had used with us and sparring.</p><p>We only did a very short training stint, for which I was grateful because I was still pretty tired, and Sasuke took me back to ANBU HQ for the rest of the tour.</p><p>"If this is what you felt like after your training camp," I said, running chakra through my muscles to heal them, "I'm twice as sorry I tried to kill you." And Sasuke wouldn't have had cheaty-healing-chakra.</p><p>He snorted. "I think you were plenty sorry already."</p><p>Well, he wasn't wrong.</p><p>There was plenty of stuff to learn about HQ anyway – mostly it was pretty tame 'here is where you hand in reports' type of stuff, but there was also the more interesting 'here is the entrance and password, if you forget it'll try kill you' type of stuff.</p><p>"Cafeteria," Sasuke pointed out as we shuffled past a room with a fair number of ANBU in it. I peeked through the door, but it looked like a normal food court area. "There's cooked food, prepackaged food or sealed lockers to bring your own, depending on how paranoid you're feeling."</p><p>I considered. I didn't feel like the risk of someone trying to kill me via food was that high right now. And cooking was a terrible amount of effort. "Not that paranoid. Probably." But I would keep a stock on hand, just in case. And definitely work on that food seal.</p><p>"So, uh," I said, because there was no real easy way to ask this and I kinda needed to know, because team dynamics. "That whole 'no matter what you heard about suicide missions' thing… I'm not replacing someone, am I?"</p><p>There was a blank pause. "Oh. No. Nothing like that," Sasuke said finally. "Red Squad is new. But I was a floating captain for a while, moving between teams, and there are a lot of people here who are a bit…" he made a <em> sort of</em> hand gesture that wasn't part of a hand sign lexicon but was still easily understood. "And that's just not happening on my team."</p><p>"Makes sense," I agreed. At least that was one problem I didn't have to contend with, then.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The other thing I did was round up the Seal Research Group and see what progress they'd made on the barrier seals in the two weeks since I'd handed them over.</p><p>It … varied.</p><p>Takatori had written what amounted to a fourteen page dissertation on how they worked. Kurome had a bullet pointed list of potential lines of attack on someone using each barrier. Someone had suggestions potential improvements, some possible, some not, some requiring serious thought.</p><p>"Awesome," I said. "Okay, we're going to try iron out as much of this as we can, and then push the seals for approval."</p><p>Which was easier said than done in a committee setting and with the fact that they were really 'my' seals and not things the others could change or alter easily.</p><p>I spent a fair chunk of time answering questions as well. They'd started to branch off with their own projects and ideas – pushing down their own paths and trying to create their own style. I felt less than helpful, like the blind trying to lead the blind, but I was still able to offer <em> some</em> advice. And it was interesting to see where this collaborative group exercise was going because it wasn't like I was driving.</p><p>Which was how I ended up with my paperwork spread out on the kitchen table at home, filling out the registration application for my barrier seals – I'd had a half thought about foisting it off on one of the others, but that would probably have been an abuse of power. Unfortunately.</p><p>That was also how I ended up distracted from filling in paperwork and instead creating a hammerspace variation for liquids. I'd hacked up a storage seal to release <em> air</em> when we'd been in the Land of Moon but that wouldn't exactly work either. It'd need a valve. A tap.</p><p>I sketched out some seals, experimented using the kitchen sink and only made a <em> small</em> mess that was easily cleaned up. Getting water <em> in</em> was the tricky part – storage seals generally took objects as a whole, and the whole purpose was not to have a container. Which meant I had to hold the water in a chakra bubble and then seal <em> that</em> away, which was an interesting experiment in control.</p><p>And that was why, when mom walked into the kitchen, I had a calligraphy brush in my mouth trying to paint seals on the inside of my cheek.</p><p>"I don't think I want to know, do I?" she asked.</p><p>"Uhnuh," I agreed. I could write most of the seal on paper, but it needed an anchor point to compress around and I really hadn't thought this through. It was much more complicated than inking seals onto my wrist. But the whole point was that it needed to be somewhere useful.</p><p>Eventually I got it right, and set it with chakra, the rest of the seals winding off the paper and into my mouth. The inside of my cheek felt funny and I ran my tongue over it, but there wasn't even the residual taste of ink. A little dry, from keeping the saliva away, but nothing else.</p><p>A small, careful trickle of chakra into the seal and cool water spilled out into my mouth. I cut the chakra and swallowed.</p><p><em> Perfect.</em></p><p>Then I did it all again on the other side and started mixing up protein powder shakes.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I had plenty of advance warning for the bodyguard slash escort mission to the Mist Chunin Exams, so when I was officially assigned the mission there was only a little to do. Check my pack, clean my gear and make sure everything looked spick and span and professional. This was as much about show as it was about practicality – more probably, since there wasn't anything I could do that Tsunade couldn't.</p><p>In that vein, the biggest surprise was when I saw who else was on the mission team.</p><p>"Sasuke?"</p><p><em> Solo mission? Not quite.</em> Maybe he'd internally justified it as 'well, the only <em> ANBU</em> on the team' but that wasn't true any longer. Or maybe he'd just been flat out lying. Probably that.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at me. "Huh."</p><p>I shrugged. I guessed it made sense. Any justifications you could use to make <em> me</em> a Hokage bodyguard equally applied to Sasuke. Good showing at the last exams, good reputation, growing strength, not exactly required to be anywhere else right now… and safe under the Hokage's eye the whole trip.</p><p>"Well, it'll be cool to see what Hidden Mist is like," I said. "I hope we get to catch up with Haku."</p><p>"I hope it's less exciting than the last two exams," Sasuke returned, deadpan.</p><p>"That too."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I wanted to watch a couple of filler arcs that I haven't seen before to get some information right, but I didn't get around to it. Which is a partial justification for the delay.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hidden Mist Arc: Chapter 138</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: When I go home very shortly, I will try to stop by the Set Location and take some photos, because I actually have a specific place that I'm now headcanoning as Hidden Mist.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 138</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them ~ Winston S. Churchill</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Travelling with Tsunade was an interesting feeling. It wasn't like we <em> hadn't</em> before – the trip to Hidden Grass Chunin Exams – but that had been with a much larger group. This time it was just the three of us, because the competitors were already there and had been for weeks.</p><p>We pushed a little harder than I would have normally, but it wasn't like Sasuke and I couldn't keep up. There was something about being able to stretch out and <em> go</em> , anyway, because running circles around a training field was fine for conditioning but it didn't match the feeling of actually <em> going somewhere</em> .</p><p>And if I spent some time imagining a world where the three of us had been active duty ninja at the same time and this was an actual mission, well. That was entirely between me and myself. But it would have been awesome. Just saying.</p><p>We reached the Port City on the east coast, where a representative from Hidden Mist was waiting with a ship to ferry all the guests out to the island.</p><p>We made sure to approach slowly instead of just running through the city. Which was both polite and made it seem like we had just leisurely strolled here from Konoha without a care in the world.</p><p>At the docks there was a marquee and party tables with umbrellas and what looked like finger food and a drinks counter. There were plenty of people seated and chatting, some with entourages and their own ninja guards.</p><p>It was a little bit more than just herding people onto a ship and setting sail. It could have even been called 'posh' what with the ocean view and all.</p><p>"Hokage-sama," the Mist Jounin in charge greeted us, bowing politely. "You're just in time. We're going to begin boarding in about half an hour, so until then please help yourself to food and drinks. If you have any other requests, please let me know. I'm here to help!"</p><p>Tsunade demurred but I paused long enough to smile brightly at him. "Congratulations on your promotion, Haku," I said, tapping his vest teasingly. He was wearing a standard shinobi uniform, as were all the other Mist-nin here, so it was probably to help all the civilians identify who was who.</p><p>"And you as well," Haku murmured back, with a small smile. "I hope we'll be able to catch up later."</p><p>The food was fancy and I ate a few little shrimp on cracker things because they were there. It was a little bit weird given that we'd been eating regular camp food on the way here, rehydrated ration packs and whatever small game we could catch on the way. Such was ninja life, having to adapt to all kinds of situations.</p><p>Probably not what that rule was referring to.</p><p>Tsunade orbited the waiting site, exchanging pleasantries with the people there. I tried to commit faces and names to memory, who was important and why. There wasn't anyone I recognized, but there was probably more than one meeting point and / or departure time.</p><p>Haku seemed pretty busy, constantly moving around but always smiling. It seemed like Hidden Mist were really trying to go all out with impressing their clients. Which was fair enough, because this would be the first real chance for people to visit the 'new' Hidden Mist under Mei's leadership. They would absolutely want to make the most of that.</p><p>The ship we ended up boarding was different to the boat we'd used to go to Land of Snow, which made sense since this was going to be a much shorter trip. Thankfully. It had less outside deck space and was more of an enclosed ferry type thing.</p><p>It was a nicer trip, too, though that might have been down to the fact that I had anti-nausea jutsu now.</p><p>It became obvious when we started getting near to Land of Mist though.</p><p>On account of the mist.</p><p>When we'd gone to Land of Waves, we'd arrived stealthily under cover of fog so thick you couldn't see a foot in front of yourself. This wasn't <em> quite</em> so bad, but it probably covered a much larger area and I was willing to bet it made sailing conditions hell.</p><p>It was also full of chakra.</p><p>I exhaled slowly through my nose. I was really starting to hate sensing 'weird natural chakra'. I wanted to say 'who knows if it means anything' but that was starting to seem like a sucker bet that even Tsunade wouldn't take.</p><p>"Problem?" Sasuke asked, barely audible. He'd shifted at an angle, so we were facing different directions to maximize coverage.</p><p>"Chakra mist," I said back equally as quiet.</p><p>"Technique?"</p><p>I shrugged one shoulder. It could have been it was probably too much for any one person to have set, unless Mist had someone like <em> Pein</em> hidden away, but it <em> could</em> have been seal generated. I was pretty sure Konoha's Barrier Team monitored the wall via seals and Mist <em> could</em> have been doing something similar.</p><p>Tsunade frowned minutely and tapped her fingers. "None I know of," she said.</p><p>Yeah, that wasn't reassuring.</p><p>I sighed and let my eyes sink shut as I tried to focus on it. There was plenty of it in the water too, so it might have been a natural chakra thing, like how Land of Snow had felt <em> cold</em> . That had been natural, until it had been hijacked to bring about spring, anyway. It wasn't uniform the way the Fire Temple had been, or the way a single persons jutsu would have been, but it was… scrambled. Like white noise.</p><p><em> Like screaming.</em></p><p>No, that was just being fanciful. It didn't feel sentient. Not focused enough. There was no intent to it.</p><p>Still.</p><p>I glanced at Sasuke. He nodded.</p><p>Good. Whether or not I was being overly paranoid, he'd be on guard too. We were as alert as we could be. I couldn't – wouldn't – second guess myself on a mission.</p><p>"Is there something wrong?" a quiet voice asked, and I was reminded that we were under very close watch here, however friendly. The fact that we were <em> on alert</em> was probably not very diplomatic.</p><p>I made an effort to relax my shoulders. "Sorry, Haku," I said, smiling sheepishly. "I get a bit sea sick. It's nothing, really."</p><p>"You should have seen her on our last trip," Sasuke said dryly. "I didn't think people could go that green without some kind of bloodlimit."</p><p><em> Deflect and defuse</em> . It seemed to work because Haku laughed. "I see. Can I offer you anything for it? We have plenty of sea sickness pills."</p><p>"I've already had some," I assured him. "I'm fine. Just a little uncomfortable. I'd normally just go outside to get some fresh air, but it looks a bit damp out there."</p><p>"We brought out our best weather for our guests," Haku said serenely. "So, you can see all the wonders of the Village Hidden in the Mist."</p><p>"I'm definitely seeing mist," I agreed. "Very impressive."</p><p>"It's what we're known for," Haku said. "Are you sure there's nothing you need? Water? Ice?"</p><p>"Ice would be great, thanks," I said, amused.</p><p>He twisted a circle of it into being between his hands and the last time this had happened I'd been tired and feverish and I hadn't been able to appreciate how fine his control was.</p><p>"If you keep crowning me, people will get jealous," I said, allowing him to set it on my head.</p><p>"I have no idea what you're talking about," he demurred. "Now please, let me know if you need anything else."</p><p>We waved him off and settled in to wait.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The island that was the Land of Water - or the one of the islands that we were visiting, anyway - loomed out of the mist in a very imposing sort of manner. 'Tall' was my first impression, with many craggy cliffsides facing the water. 'Barren' as well, since the grass was yellow and stalky and all the trees were stunted, lopsided things from salt and wind, but that was its own kind of ecosystem too.</p><p>The mist had started to thin out a bit, too, and wasn't so full of … whatever I was sensing. I was optimistic about that.</p><p>We curved around the side of the island, past the cliffs and a few beaches, before passing through a breakwater and into a reasonably busy harbor.</p><p>The security looked <em> intense.</em></p><p>"Welcome to Kirigakure!" Haku announced to the ship. "Please remain seated while we dock. Then security is going to check the guest list and make sure we haven't lost anyone over the side-" there were a few giggles "-and you'll all be escorted towards the guest lodging and entertainment. Thank you for your cooperation!"</p><p>It took a peculiar sort of skill to get people to submit to ninja security with a laugh, that was for sure.</p><p>The guest accommodation was a hotel that was right beside a lovely little beach thing. We got a suite of rooms, with a living room type thing, a master bedroom and a twin bed room to the side.</p><p>All very fancy. All the type of place you would stash a visiting Kage.</p><p>"You're not going to ditch the crown?" Tsunade asked, sounding amused.</p><p>"Do you need me too?" I asked. I didn't know for <em> sure</em> but carrying around of chunk of someone else's jutsu was just asking for them to use it to monitor you. It wasn't like we were going anywhere or doing anything that I needed to duck surveillance for, and there were plenty of guards watching us anyway.</p><p>Diplomacy wise, there was the fact that it was a visible tie to our hosts for anyone in the know about Haku's abilities. There was also the callback to the last exams and to my nickname which… may or may not have been a good thing, come to think of it.</p><p>Well, it was going to melt soon enough, anyway.</p><p>Since it was still daylight, we decided to check out the beach. Like the docks in Port City, this was very clearly set up with the comfort of guests in mind; marquees, a bar, plenty of beach chairs.</p><p>The beach itself…</p><p>The thing was. I'd grown up on iron sand beaches. Black sand was my default and any time I went to a white sand beach it felt a little like visiting a story book. A thing I was aware existed and that other people talked about all the time but not my lived experience.</p><p>(Yes, I know. The irony. But it had been that way even <em> before</em> the whole 'world of fiction' thing.)</p><p>This looked like home. The path sloped down to a small curved beach, hemmed in by raw cliffsides and stony outcroppings.</p><p>"Black sand?" Sasuke said.</p><p>"Could be volcanic," I answered offhand, "which means it's probably basalt. Or could be iron sand which can be mined for steel. Or just sedimentary deposit."</p><p>Volcanic made sense, given that Land of Water was a chain of islands. But iron sand would maybe have explained how they'd developed such a strong swordsmanship culture. Or it could have been both.</p><p>Down on the beach the Mizukage was a vibrant spot of blue and red, moving around and making conversation. "Hokage-dono," she greeted, smiling. "And entourage, of course." She nodded in our direction. "Welcome to Kiri. I hope your trip was pleasant."</p><p>"Pleasant enough, Mizukage-dono," Tsunade greeted back. "My congratulations on your nuptials."</p><p>Mei fluttered and demurred, but I thought she looked genuinely pleased.</p><p>A little more small talk was exchanged and the Mizukage invited us all to dine with her tonight. "And I'd be delighted to give you a tour of my village, as well," she added. "Kiri has bound to have changed since last time you were here."</p><p>An approved opportunity to nosy around, in other words, while keeping us under the eye of people who could make sure we didn't nosy <em> too</em> well.</p><p>"No doubt," Tsunade said, a little dryly perhaps, since her last visit to Hidden Mist would have been before she left and therefore more than a decade ago. "But I am very interested in seeing the changes you've made."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Dinner was at the Mizukage's residence – or whatever the main building was designated as – so it was private, as compared to the very bustling hotel restaurant.</p><p>We weren't the only ones there either.</p><p>"Onoki isn't scheduled to arrive until tomorrow," Mei said, "so I'm afraid it's just the three of us."</p><p>To be honest, I was more surprised by the knowledge that the Tsuchikage was intending on coming at all, than the fact that he wasn't here to make nice. I guess he hadn't <em> quite</em> decided on which way he was going to jump, though I don't think that any one held out hope it would be in our favour. The best we could hope for would be that he just stayed out of it all – and even that was asking for a knife in the back when the fighting with Cloud was over.</p><p>"Kazekage-dono," Tsunade said, nodding in Gaara's direction.</p><p>We all shuffled awkwardly around the circular table, Kage bookended by their bodyguards. I ended up next to Kankurou and Sasuke next to Zabuza, which left Haku and Temari as the third join. Not a bad placement, all told.</p><p>The room we were in was smaller and less ornate – more work like and functional. Still nice, still classy, but less embellished. Even that felt like a deliberate choice, as if saying that the excess in other places was a front for the pampered rich and that people like us, <em> real ninja</em> , wouldn't be impressed by it.</p><p>"Nice hat," I murmured to Gaara, across Kankurou's amused shoulder, as we took our places. "Suits you."</p><p>He was the only one wearing his but I knew what it was like to feel younger and less experienced than those around you and to try and shore that up with the image of professionalism. My entire look had been based on that feeling.</p><p>Sympathy for Gaara aside though, it was pretty neat to be in a meeting of Kage where the female Kage outnumbered the male. As in, I didn't really think that was a thing that happened anywhere in recorded history. Heck, with four out of nine, we were only one off from having a female majority in this room <em> period.</em></p><p>Kankurou bumped my leg with his knee under the table. "You know I'm disappointed, sparky," he said quietly. "Only a Special Jounin? I was expecting more."</p><p>Quiet, sure, but everyone at the table was a ninja so there was no way everyone wouldn't hear it, even if they were having their own conversations. It made everything a little stilted when your boss was sitting next to you having an official diplomatic conversation. I was pretty sure that, as bodyguards, we were supposed to be seen and not heard.</p><p>"Special Jounin is perfectly respectable," I told him, though yes, Sasuke and I were clearly the lowest ranked people in the room. Everyone else was a Jounin. And Haku, Temari and Kankurou had all managed it in the year since the Grass Exams as well. "But I just got caught up with training and fuuinjutsu and stuff. And I was hospitalized for a while, so that didn't help much."</p><p>"Yeah," he said, very casually, "I heard about that. Sort of. What happened?"</p><p>Subtle, Kankurou. "Orochimaru, what else?" I said with a shrug. "Or his minions anyway. Tsunade-sama managed to come up with an antidote, but it was a pretty close call."</p><p>That was the official story. That was the <em> only</em> story.</p><p>Kankurou didn't give any indication whether he believed it or not. And… without all the pieces of the puzzle there was no real way for him to know what had happened. But the Sand Siblings had been there for Gelel, and that wasn't <em> the same</em> but it definitely gave them a perspective that no one else really had.</p><p>"Between that and Shikamaru, it's been a rough year," I tacked on, a slight but subtle shift of conversation.</p><p>"I knew something was rotten with that mission," Kankurou said, with a slight frown. "How's he doing? Temari's been worried," he tacked on, apparently not being able to pass up the chance to goad his sister.</p><p>Temari gave him a death glare across the table that said <em> no, shut up</em> more eloquently than words and turned aggressively away.</p><p>"He's fine," I said, smothering a smile. "Back to taking missions and everything. I'll pass on your well wishes."</p><p>"-I've heard your Academy program has been… drastically overhauled," Tsunade was saying to the Mizukage, which was a much more official topic of conversation.</p><p>"Oh, yes," Mei said coyly. "Zabuza has done an excellent job with the training of our next generation. I'm sure you'll see plenty of evidence of his methods tomorrow during the exams." She reached for his hand, which was resting on the table, without looking and patted it.</p><p>Zabuza looked like he would have rather been anywhere else than having this conversation, up to and including stabbing himself in the face with his own sword.</p><p>"I'm sure I will," Tsunade said, mildly. "He's certainly a … bold choice for the Academy Head."</p><p>"Zabuza has always had strong opinions on the Academy training program," Mei said. And wasn't that a giant understatement and euphemism. <em> Strong opinion.</em></p><p>And as much as I could see where Tsunade was coming from, and as much as the idea of Zabuza; Demon of the Bloody Mist as an exasperated Iruka-sensei type figure getting mobbed by thirty pre-teens made me want to laugh… Haku was pretty solid evidence that he wasn't bad at it.</p><p>The topic of conversation also, eventually, tackled the giant elephant in the corner – the looming war with Cloud. Because when else were the three Kage involved going to be able to communicate face to face about it? Outside of this room, we might end up pretending everything was fine, but it started to become very clear just how <em> fragile</em> this alliance was.</p><p>Mei prevaricated on the topic. "Of course, we stand by our allies," she said. "Though at the current time it's difficult to say what kind of assistance we could provide. The situation could evolve in so many different ways and we just don't have the information to anticipate what those will be."</p><p>Gaara was far more blunt.</p><p>"We don't have the ninja," Gaara said, terribly flat and maybe giving away just a little too much. Well, it wasn't like we didn't know how bad the situation in Sand was. "We can assist Leaf with any operations in Wind Country or River Country, but anything more would be overstretching. In a worst-case scenario, the most we could send a squad of Jounin."</p><p>That wasn't nothing, but it also wasn't a lot. And since Cloud was (so far) the one we were fighting, we wouldn't exactly be carrying out war operations in the west. Which meant, basically, that anything we'd be funnelling off to Hidden Sand would be regular missions - and that would mean Konoha itself wasn't able to carry it's workload. Even if we contracted them out and still took some fee on it, it wasn't a great situation for a ninja village to be in.</p><p>"I understand your positions," Tsunade said carefully, and that dragged everything into another round of careful negotiating.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I was pretty interested in the tour, if I was honest. I didn't really think we would get to see very much that they didn't want us to see – all the real snooping would have been done by the Jounin-sensei like Anko while they were waiting – but what they chose to let us see was enough.</p><p>Because it was clear that Mist was putting on its best face for the exams and all the people that had visited for the exams. But how much of a step up <em> was </em> it? What was that best face covering and at whose expense?</p><p>Obviously, they'd changed the Academy system. The famous Bloody Mist graduation exam had been gone for years, but that was still all anyone really remembered about schooling system.</p><p>"Kiri Academy currently consists of seven different training halls," Mei said, leading us into a long, brick building with a flourish. She flicked on the lights.</p><p>It was definitely a training hall, long and empty. There were storage rooms to the side and a bunch of dummies set up against a wall down one end – round targets for throwing weapons and wooden peg targets for Taijutsu practice. It smelt faintly like feet and sweat. Pretty normal.</p><p>"No classrooms?" Tsunade asked, quirking an eyebrow. "An… interesting choice."</p><p>Mei let the criticism roll off of her. "We value a practical education," she said. "Students in Kiri learn by doing. When they're not in the training halls, our teachers have them outside learning how to deal with the natural environment."</p><p>"Kids get bored when you make them sit still and shut up," Zabuza said, not <em> quite</em> growling. "And that's not what we're training them for anyway, so it's a waste of everyone's time."</p><p>Given the timelines and when he'd become a missing ninja, about ninety percent of Haku's training had probably happened on the road. Zabuza was probably pretty good at just using natural opportunities.</p><p>"We don't <em> neglect</em> basic skills, of course," Mei said smoothly. "We simply try to have the teaching of reading and writing, for example, incorporated or interspersed with other training. It's been working well for us, so far."</p><p>Konoha had had a lot of outdoors classes, compared to what I was used to, but it'd still been very classroom based. "What's your student to teacher ratio like?" I asked, curiously. "It must be pretty low if you're being that hands on."</p><p>Mei paused. <em> Whoops, that's probably too classified, my bad.</em> "About twenty," she said. "Ideally, we'd like it to be lower, but we're being very particular about our teachers so we don't have as many as we'd like."</p><p>Konoha had about thirty students to teacher, though that was <em> with</em> an assistant, so maybe it worked out to fifteen?</p><p>Further along from the training hall was a low, artificial beach with a breakwater that created a kind of lagoon – for the kids to practice water related skills, Mei explained. I figured that covered water jutsu as well as more prosaic things like swimming and fishing and how-not-to-be-eaten-by-sharks.</p><p>I mean, there probably weren't sharks in there. But it seemed like an important skill to learn.</p><p>We also got to see the hospital. Or rather, an empty wing of the hospital that seemed to be new.</p><p>"We don't want to disturb the patients, of course," Mei said, smiling.</p><p>But this was definitely Tsunade's element and even an empty wing gave her a <em> lot</em> to work with. It wasn't quite the interrogation I'd seen her level on members of <em> our</em> hospital, but she was very interested.</p><p>Personally, I thought there were a lot of people here. Even if I assumed that they had more medical ninja than Konoha (which was an odd assumption to make) the number of patients in overnight, or in the waiting rooms exceeded what Konoha hospital would have had. I'd never given much of a thought to how <em> quickly</em> Konoha rattled through patients, but clearly it had an important effect.</p><p>There were other places we went, though none quite so important as those. I spotted quite a few guard posts and patrols, though I couldn't exactly call that <em> unusual,</em> could I?</p><p>Overall, well. I didn't really know what I expected. Mist was still one of the big five villages, so of course it was still a <em> functional village</em> but it had been in a civil war for so long and had so many blood thirsty ninja that I was still a little bit surprised by how nice most things were. I was sure there were poor corners of the village that we were being kept away from, but nothing we'd seen indicated crushing poverty or lack of civilization.</p><p>There was a beautiful mural made of sea glass on the ground of the open plaza, blues and greens and sharp red – Mei, rising out of the ocean – that was commemorative of her coronation and beautiful without being a terrible <em> expense.</em> It seemed very fitting for her, if you could say a thing made of recycling that everyone walked over was <em> fitting</em> . I wondered if it was their version of faces on mountains, or if it were Mei alone that had one.</p><p>When we returned to the hotel, I left the melting remains of Haku's crown outside feeling … contemplative.</p><p>"Opinions?" Tsunade asked, when we were alone in our rooms.</p><p>"I wouldn't want to go to their hospital," I said, after a pause when I couldn't come up with anything better to say.</p><p>Sasuke rolled his eyes. "You don't ever want to go to Konoha hospital," he pointed out.</p><p>"There are definitely more patients there," I said, giving a brief explanation of what I'd sensed. "The Academy system seemed interesting, though."</p><p>Sasuke made a noise of agreement. "A little more like… other training," he said. "More practical experience, less bookwork. Could be good for some skills but if you don't already have the basics down…"</p><p>"It does seem like they're trying to push out Genin as fast as possible," I said. "I didn't ask about their graduating age but… the twins were pretty young. I hope they're an unusual case."</p><p>"The other competitors in the exams are older," Tsunade said after a moment's thought. "So, they're probably only graduating promising genin early. We'll have to see what the quality of their forces are like over the next few years. I don't see that kind of teaching working in Konoha, it'd be detrimental to our medical and administrative staff for starters, but it might be worth modifying for field shinobi…"</p><p>I shrugged. I was definitely no education expert. "The rest of the village seems… well maintained. We didn't see many people so I can't gauge the mood or anything, but nothing seems to be falling apart. The shops have plenty of inventory. None of the advertised prices seemed too unusual – produce seemed high, but if they have to import a lot of stuff then it makes sense to be more expensive."</p><p>Admittedly, I'd just been glancing in through windows to make those observations, but they counted.</p><p>"Security was high," Sasuke added, "but unobtrusive. Probably higher than normal because of the number of guests, but the guardhouses looked like permanent locations. I'd say security is normally pretty high here."</p><p>"It used to be," Tsunade agreed. "Mei has certainly made it much friendlier. On the surface, anyway."</p><p>And with that ominous statement, we concluded our assessment for the night.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning was bright and a little cold, but the mist rising off the water was eerily beautiful in its own way. The exams didn't start until mid-morning so we had a bit of time to ourselves before they started.</p><p>There weren't as many people out on the beach as there had been the previous day, but those who were there were watching Zabuza lead a few other ninja through sword kata. I saw Chojuro but no one else that I really recognized.</p><p>"Well, you have to give Terumi that," Tsunade said, casting a judgmental eye over them. "She's knows how to show off her villages … assets."</p><p>"Reforming the Seven Swordsmen would be a pretty impressive move," I agreed.</p><p>"That too," she said dryly. She took a seat, brushing the morning dew off it with a wave of chakra. I found a nearby rock to perch on and Sasuke folded his arms and lurked.</p><p>They weren't really going through any particularly fancy or secret moves, given the whole… audience thing, but no one ever passed up the chance to study other ninja's techniques. The katas ended and Chojuro was paired up with one of the other ninja – the one holding Nuibari - to spar.</p><p>Zabuza stalked around them for a little while, before apparently being satisfied with their form or whatever, and retreating off the water.</p><p>"Come to see how <em> actual</em> swordsmen use legendary weapons?" he asked, propping one foot up on the rocks beside me. "Or did Leaf realize you're pathetic with a sword and give the Raijin no Ken to someone more skilled?"</p><p>"I still have it," I said mildly. "And I've been practicing."</p><p>I would never <em> be</em> a kenjutsu expert, so I didn't feel to insulted but… I felt a little insulted. Just a touch. Because there had been that whole thing where Zabuza had declared us 'not good enough to be ninja' and yes, while I technically met his criteria of being in the bingo books now, there was a small part of me that wanted him to acknowledge it. With, like, words.</p><p>"Heh," he said, "words are just words. If you're serious, prove it."</p><p>I had a lot of experience reading masked faces, so I knew without a doubt that the smile underneath those bandages <em> wasn't</em> a nice one.</p><p>I leant backwards, bending at the spine so that I was looking at the Hokage behind me. "Tsunade-sama," I singsonged. "Zabuza wants me to go beat him up. Is that okay?"</p><p>She gave me an amused look. "Keep it contained, Nara," she said. "The Mizukage won't be impressed if you injure the groom."</p><p>Well, that definitely sounded like an okay. I pulled myself back upright and twisted the lightsaber out of hammerspace, enjoying the way Zabuza's eyes narrowed when he couldn't tell where it came from.</p><p>"After you," I said, gesturing at the water. Yeah, lightning on the ocean. No way this could go wrong at all.</p><p>His smile was <em> definitely</em> not a nice one.</p><p>I smiled back.</p><p><hr /></p><p>AN: I'm a little sad I didn't get to write my initial idea of meeting up in Mist, which was for Shikako to walk past a class of Zabuza teaching and try not to die of hilarity. But it didn't fit with how strictly managed a visiting Kage must be.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hidden Mist Arc: Chapter 139</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 139</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The language of friendship is not words but meanings. ~ Henry David Thoreau</em></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p><em> .</em></p><p>To the surprise of no one, the exam site was on the water. Well, where else were they going to put it?</p><p>A square was marked out with buoys and three sides were edged with raised docks - high enough to be out of the splash range - with graduated seating going up and back. The area had a few raised and jagged rocks that indicated that the ground below the water wasn't just sand, and there was a half sunken ship tipped across the far side, which at least made this the most <em> interesting </em> exam arena I'd seen.</p><p>It'd give a bit of cover and a bit more strategy than the totally flat and open arenas of our exams. Might make things interesting, as long as it didn't actually turn into a game of hide and go seek.</p><p>The lower seating areas were slowly filling up with the audience, people chatting and making noise. There were plenty of Hidden Mist ninja sprinkled throughout, acting as ushers and generally trying to keep things moving smoothly.</p><p>We all filed in to the designated Kage seating at the very top of the stands, overlooking everything, Sasuke and I the customary pace back and to the side of the Hokage as her guards.</p><p>I wanted to pause but couldn't.</p><p>The designated Kage seating was… lounging beach chairs, with stripy, colourful fabric suspended on wooden frames. Colour coordinated, even, since the Konoha seat was very clearly red-and-white.</p><p>Well. I guess it would be comfortable. Tsunade settled in, retrieved a drink, and even pulling the Hokage hat low to shade her eyes like a sunhat.</p><p>We didn't get seats, but such was guard duty. We settled in, steady but alert, close enough to be useful but far enough that we weren't actually crowding.</p><p>We were perhaps a little early but the Hidden Sand delegation was already here, as well. I caught Kankurou's eye.</p><p>Then stared out over the water with my best I-am-a-serious-ninja-no-I'm-not-laughing face on. Not even a little bit. We were like the Queens Guard at Buckingham Palace, right now. No moving, no laughter.</p><p>No matter how goddamn ridiculous this was.</p><p>The Mizukage wasn't here – which was why we counted as being early – but since there were two empty chairs and the Tsuchikage was supposed to be arriving for the exam, I could take a wild guess as to where she was.</p><p>A guess that was proven correct when both Mist and Rock delegations turned up together. The Tsuchikage looked both hilariously outsized by his own bodyguards – Akatsuchi and Kurotsuchi – and also very, very annoyed.</p><p>"Tsuchikage-dono," Tsunade said in greeting. She had a drink in her hand and raised it in salute. Everything about her seemed casual.</p><p>"Senju," Onoki said, which was… interesting. Not entirely disrespectful, but very few people addressed Tsunade by her clan name. His eyes flickered, left, towards me. "You have some nerve bringing <em> her</em> with you."</p><p>"I don't know what you're implying," Tsunade said, evenly. "Any available ninja may serve as a bodyguard to the Kage at official functions."</p><p>Everything around us was still and quiet. I could feel the focused attention of everyone else in the Kage's Box. There was no doubt everyone wanted to know what was being said. We'd danced around this topic already, but our allies couldn't push it – not without accusing us.</p><p>Onoki clearly didn't have the same compunctions.</p><p>"Hmph," he snorted. "The buffer country between you and A vanishes, and you don't think the rest of us are going to be asking 'why'? Bold, for Konoha. I didn't think you'd have the guts to make the first move. Or the power."</p><p><em> Stick to the script.</em></p><p>I crossed my arms. "I don't appreciate the accusation," I said, voice admirably flat. "I was in Land of Rice Fields locating Orochimaru." I cocked my head to the side. "You know, attempting to deal with our missing nin."</p><p>The challenge was there. <em> Not that you'd know anything about that.</em> And the reminder that, oh yeah, Hidden Rock did have that one missing nin known for blowing shit up. Funny. Maybe there was a reason Onoki was being so quick to throw the first accusation?</p><p>"Nara," Tsunade said, voice a mild rebuke. "We can hardly hold Hidden Rock responsible for the actions of their missing nin. Such is the nature of missing ninja." She swirled her drink, looking at it thoughtfully. "And there is, of course… no evidence that Hidden Rock has been <em> colluding</em> with the Akatsuki or, say, hiring them for missions."</p><p>The stretched pause before 'no' indicated that there might, possibly, be some shred of evidence and wouldn't <em> that</em> be interesting, indeed?</p><p>It didn't quite put the issue to bed, as Onoki's darkening face indicated, but suddenly I wasn't the only one under intense scrutiny, so that was good in my books.</p><p>"However fascinating this is," Mei cut in, when it seemed obvious that the volley was over. She looked reasonably pleased, but I couldn't tell if that meant she'd learned something new or merely had everything go as expected. "We are on a tight schedule here. Please take a seat and we will begin!"</p><p>The Mizukage gave the opening speech, and just like that, the Chunin Exams were on.</p><p><hr /></p><p>There were some interesting fights. The Mist twins - Yoroshiku – were competing again, and were leagues better than they had been a year ago. Still much younger than everyone else on the field, but they no longer seemed like they'd been fed through a crash course of Taijutsu 101 and hoped for the best.</p><p>Hidden Sand had three genin in the competition – presumably from one team – with pretty clear gen-, nin-, tai- specialties. Shira, the taijutsu fighter, was pretty impressive and I'd have loved to see him go up against Lee.</p><p>From Konoha's side, Isaribi was in her element. Literally. The water arena was good for her. The downside was, everyone had come to Hidden Mist with the knowledge they'd have to fight water users. People were <em> prepared.</em></p><p>Yakumo was a crowd pleaser, throwing down lightning strikes and even setting the half sunken ship on fire at one point, only to wipe the genjutsu at the end of the match and revert everything to an undamaged state. She seemed to have reduced her artboard down to a small postcard and her palette into a metal travel tin, which was good thinking.</p><p>But it was Sakura that made it to the final round.</p><p>Guiltily, I had to admit I was surprised. I mean, obviously Sakura was Tsunade's apprentice. And she was hugely intelligent and determined. And in another lifetime, she had been an excellent field ninja.</p><p>But it was definitely true that in term of actual battlefield experience,<em> actual fights</em> … she had very limited involvement.</p><p>The other finalist was a boy from Hidden Valley – the Land of Rivers. He had used some water ninjutsu in previous matches, but given how the tournament was all packed into one day this time, I wondered how his stamina was doing.</p><p>Okay, presumably, since his opening move was a barrage of water needles, firing a constant, wide stream of them at her. Given the location, running out of material for them wasn't much of an issue.</p><p>Sakura proved that Tsunade had really hammered home the importance of dodging – possibly literally – as she flipped, wove and dove across the field. There wasn't really an 'out of bounds', given the seating around the edges of the field, but she ended up backed uncomfortably into a corner of the arena.</p><p>Sakura dodged under the needle barrage, and shifted her stance from evasion to attack, planting her feet firmly and drawing a fist back in a clearly telegraphed punch.</p><p>"Cha!" She punched <em> downwards</em> into the ocean. And where earth would have split and cracked apart, the water wobbled violently at the point of impact, surging <em> up</em> and <em> away</em> , rising into a wave that smashed down heavily on her opponent and slammed him into the sunken ship.</p><p>The crowd exploded into a mass of cheers, whooping and hollering.</p><p><em> Follow through</em> , I urged. <em> You've got him on the ropes, make sure he stays there!</em></p><p>But she held back, waiting and when the water finished streaming off the side of the ship, her opponent was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>With my chakra sense, I could track him underwater, but Sakura couldn't. It was a reasonably obvious tactic, but she had to first <em> see</em> and look around and check for genjutsu and by that time there were hands on her ankles, pulling her underwater.</p><p>And either her opponent had as much lack of follow through as she did, or there was a brief underwater tussle, because they both surfaced and pulled themselves back on top of the water several feet apart.</p><p>"Your apprentice in more than medical jutsu, I see," Mei said delicately. "That was a very remarkable punch."</p><p>Down below, Sakura raced through handseals and then blew away in a burst of pink sakura petals. Her opponent twisted around, checked his blind spots and then realized it was a genjutsu and blew it away with a sharp 'Kai'. Sakura had covered the distance between them, though not launched an attack, and they engaged in a brief taijutsu tussle.</p><p>Her taijutsu was <em> good</em> , in that it was very by-the-book perfection, and if she'd been able to hit him with any kind of charged attack she would have had the upper hand. But this was where her lack of field experience seemed to let her down again, and she couldn't quite buy herself enough time to do that. I didn't think her opponent was a close range fighter, though, and that was probably why neither could really get the upper hand.</p><p>They ended up on the sunken ship, breathing hard.</p><p>The Hidden Valley boy paused, eyes flickering around the arena, and then threw his hands together for a very long sequence of seals.</p><p><em> Last chance move</em> . This was the final match. If he had anything big to throw down, he'd do it <em> now</em> . Reserving stamina didn't really matter much, as long as you could take out just this one last person.</p><p>"Water Style: Water Catapult!"</p><p>The surface of the arena blobbed together, forming three droplets about the size of a person. The first detached from the ocean, and shot itself with extreme speed towards Sakura.</p><p>She dodged.</p><p>It slammed into the ship, punching hole clean through, side to side. Where it hit the ocean outside of the arena, water sprayed into the air like a geyser.</p><p>The crowd went <em> oooh</em> .</p><p>The second droplet moved.</p><p>Again, Sakura dodged. The shipwreck was looking <em> pretty</em> wrecked right about now. There wasn't very much stable footing at all. She'd have a hard time dodging the next one and it looked like she knew it.</p><p>The third droplet finished forming.</p><p>Sakura moved. Not off the ship, or towards her opponent, but towards the ship <em> mast.</em> She wrapped her arms around it and <em> lifted.</em> Wood cracked and groaned and then tore free.</p><p>She twisted, hefting a massive log of wood like it weighed nothing and then smacked that last Water Catapult out into the open ocean like the best home run in history.</p><p>I wanted to laugh. The crowd was screaming in a kind of cacophony of sound, and Sakura started to use the mast like a fly swatter – like a whack'a'mole – to hit her opponent, who was very suddenly on the run and looking like he didn't know what to do about that.</p><p>She smacked him down into the water, then when he popped back up, swiped him sideways with it. "Shannaro!" She shouted, and the ship mast kept going, turning a full circle to slam into the ship, person and all.</p><p>The referee moved forward and Sakura backed off.</p><p>"Match!" he called, holding a <em> clearly unconscious</em> boy. "The winner of the Kirigakure Chunin Exams is Sakura Haruno from the Hidden Leaf Village!"</p><p>The crowd cheered. Sakura <em> beamed.</em></p><p>Up in the stands, I caught Sasuke's eye. <em> That is the best ending to a Chunin Exams ever</em> , I wanted to say. <em> She just smacked him around with a giant piece of wood.</em></p><p>Sasuke looked reluctantly amused, so yeah. He totally agreed with me.</p><p>"Congratulations!" Mei said, standing and her voice carried all throughout the stadium. "To Sakura and to all our competitors of the day. We're going to reconvene now to discuss promotions, and there'll be a ceremony to present awards just after dinner in the main square. I hope everyone attends!"</p><p>The awards ceremony was pretty glitzy for something that wasn't really very formal. There was music and fireworks, but it basically boiled down to the four Kage saying a small speech and calling out names and handing over Chunin vests.</p><p>Still, all three of ours got promoted so, all in all, a very successful Chunin Exams was had.</p><p><hr /></p><p>The next morning, that atmosphere seemed a lot more … charged. Not quite tense, but certainly more formal.</p><p>Sasuke and I were in our Chunin Blues and vest, because that was the only 'formal uniform' we had, and Tsunade had dressed up in the full Hokage robes. Sasuke and I were both carrying gifts, and I was pretty curious to know what they were. Well no. I had a scroll, and Sasuke had a covered bundle that was <em> most probably</em> a sword, but still. The details.</p><p>I got to find out soon enough. Because obviously wedding gifts weren't just about <em> giving</em> something to the bride and groom, they were about letting everyone know what you'd given them. And how valuable it was. And how good you were for giving them that.</p><p>There was a presentation. Thing.</p><p>And oh boy, were there plenty of guests to get through. Some of the gifts seemed decent – or valuable enough to like anyway – but there was plenty of the obligatory 'ugly vases' to go around. Mei seemed to have the whole 'diplomatic thanks' down pat, regardless of what it was.</p><p>Tsunade stepped up.</p><p>"Recently an artifact of the Hidden Mist came into our hands," she began. Sasuke stepped up beside her, bundle flat in his arms for her to unwrap and reveal. "So I return to you <em> Kiba</em> , the lightning sword, of the Seven Legendary Swords of the Mist."</p><p>She passed them over, two handed and respectful.</p><p>Mei received them with the same formal attitude. "I thank you," she said.</p><p>Tsunade nodded. "Though it would be a poor gift to merely return something that belongs to the Hidden Mist," she went on. I stepped forward and held out the scroll and she plucked it from my hands. "So I also offer this. Three places in the Konoha Medical Training Program for whoever you deem fit. And the stationing of two fully trained Konoha Medics inside Hidden Mist until their training is complete."</p><p>There was a low whistle from the crowd and I was almost entirely certain it was Kankurou. Which. No kidding. That was pretty goddamn generous. Though it really did double back into 'helping ourselves' if Tsunade's negotiating with alliances came to fruition.</p><p>Once that was done, the guests were all herded – gently and with kindness – by a variety of Mist ninja down to the beach where the wedding was going to take place. It was nicely set up, with benches arranged on the beach and a little white gazebo just floating on the water.</p><p><em> Huh. Nice. </em> Well that was thematic. And I mean, to ninja water was just another surface and it <em> did</em> give it just that little touch of magic.</p><p>The three of us were seated near the front in prime location – because Tsunade was a Kage – but I did catch sight of Team Anko (all also professionally dressed in chunin blues) in the standing section near the cliffs.</p><p>Then the music kicked in and the groom and officiant appeared and Mei, beautifully dressed, made her way out onto the water to meet them.</p><p>And then the water beneath her feet began to tremble, like a glass of water during an earthquake. The ripples lapped against the beach, against the rocks, faster and more violently, going from gentle trembling to white capped waves, crisscrossing over themselves.</p><p>Then, in the distance, a giant body burst out of the ocean, water streaming violently off its sides, and screamed defiance into the sky.</p><p><em> Well, I guess that was what I was sensing</em> , I thought almost off-hand in that one perfect moment before everything turned to absolute shit. <em> It was the Three Tails reforming. Good to know.</em></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p><em> .</em></p><p>I thought I could get the exam, the wedding and the fight all done quickly in one chapter, but that does not seem to be the case at all. Kudos to everyone that guessed '3 Tails' as the mysterious chakra.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hidden Mist Arc: Chapter 140</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN:</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 140</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Then from on high - somewhere in the distance</p><p>There's a voice that calls, "Remember who you are"</p><p>If you lose yourself - your courage soon will follow</p><p>So be strong tonight - remember who you are</em></p><p><em> ~Sound The Bugle Now; Bryan Adams</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"You know, I really thought it took longer for Tailed Beasts to reform."</p><p>That was, what, two years? Less? No wonder everyone went for 'sealing' as their first option. The amount of effort that went into killing them and you only got two years before you had to do it again? No dice.</p><p>"Probably not our biggest concern right now," Sasuke said dryly.</p><p>Well no. That was true. The ocean had turned from 'pleasant gentle waves lapping at the shore' to 'very definitely a storm', and forceful white capped waves were sweeping up onto the beach, floating the wooden pews and trying to either slam them into each other or drag them out to sea. People were starting to evacuate up to dry land but quite a few of the heavily robed guests were having trouble, though there were enough ninja on hand to help them out. Kankurou was pulling people out of the surf with chakra strings, which seemed highly effective, though possibly terrifying for the rescuees.</p><p>Out at sea, the Three Tails screamed again. It was far enough out that I couldn't really sense it, but it looked like <em> that</em> was going to change very rapidly.</p><p>It was coming our way, and fast.</p><p>Ahead of us, Mei bent down and grabbed handfuls of her skirt, ripping the heavy fabric of her wedding dress and revealing that, underneath her finery, she was wearing her shinobi boots. I was suddenly glad that I was wearing blues and hadn't been dressed up – it wasn't my usual field gear but it was close enough. "We can't let it get to shore," she said grimly. "Ao! You're in charge of evacuation – get everyone into the shelters! Haku, I need you with me, instead. Zabuza… we need to slow it down."</p><p>Zabuza shed his jacket and Chojuro was hurrying forward with his sword. It clearly hadn't been too far away and while I doubted that they'd expected <em> this</em> it was nice to see that they had been prepared for <em> something.</em> About another dozen Mist ninja were already starting to assemble on the water forming a clear defensive line.</p><p>Tsunade turned back towards the beach for a second, searching for the rest of the Konoha ninja who had been at the back of the wedding crowd and were now getting swept away with the exodus. "Anko, assist with the evacuation and get Sakura to start triage on the injured."</p><p>No one was terribly injured yet but.. there was a Tailed Beast incoming. It probably wouldn't stay that way.</p><p>Anko saluted and Sakura bowed deeply, hands clasped in front of her chest. The three genin seemed shocked, huddling near their sensei, but hopefully they'd be fine.</p><p>I didn't have time to spare many thoughts for them, anyway, because Tsunade followed the Mist contingent out onto the water and Sasuke and I stuck with her. Temari followed us, but she was the only one of the Hidden Sand team to do so – though I could feel Gaara's chakra seeping deep into the ground below us, probably trying to create more sand.</p><p>Oh. <em> Iron sand.</em> That was a totally different technique, wasn't it?</p><p><em> Damn. </em> If Gaara only had his gourds worth of sand, then that we were down a <em> lot</em> of firepower. Unless he went full Shukaku, anyway, and while bijuu vs bijuu was probably <em> fairer</em> it would result in a lot of collateral damage.</p><p>Actually, that might just result in having to fight <em> two</em> bijuu. Bad plan. Scratch that.</p><p>And the Tsuchikage was … not following. The Hidden Rock team was assisting the wedding guests but making no moves to join the fight. The thought crossed my mind that they might take this opening for … something, but that was going to be a problem for the Mist ninja to deal with, not me. Or hell, maybe they were just looking forward to seeing everyone get wrecked. Schadenfreude at its finest.</p><p>The Sanbi seemed impossibly large. Shukaku had towered over even the tallest trees in Konoha, but out here on the ocean there were no such points of reference. Distance seemed like an illusion – it kept getting closer and larger, outline blurred strangely by the misting water thrown up by its movement. I'd heard the Three Tails referred to as a turtle, but that didn't really seem to encompass it. It had a spikey, thick carapace like a crab, or a shell like a clam, and it's face was equally as armored with a fringe of spikes. One of its giant eyes was closed – a blind spot?</p><p>"The Sanbi secretes a hallucinogenic mist!" Mei shouted in warning, proving that <em> no</em> , that misting water wasn't as harmless as I had assumed. "Be careful!"</p><p>I thickened the layer of chakra around my skin. If it could prevent scent tracking – keep my skin from leaving an impression on the world – it could hopefully work in reverse and prevent poisonous gas from getting to my skin.</p><p><em> Poisons are the worst.</em></p><p>"I've got it!" Temari shouted back and snapped her fan open to three moons. She spun and launched a gale of howling wind at the Sanbi. It wasn't quite the sky-dragon-tornado thing, but it wasn't far off it, either. It ripped past me and tugged at my clothes and I was beside her, not ahead. The mist around it was blown away, along with a fair portion of water carved out of the ocean and flung into the air behind it, and the Sanbi reared back and up, almost <em> standing</em> and it <em> towered</em> . It's underside was red and striated, almost muscle looking and Mei spat rapid fire balls of lava at it like bullets - they scorched but seemed to do nothing.</p><p>The Sanbi <em> slammed</em> back down into the water.</p><p>A great wall of water swelled and rose, growing larger and larger the closer to us it got. I glanced over my shoulder and saw the water draining out of the beach. The ninja on the water were scattering but there was nowhere to go, the tsunami was making a straight line between the tailed beast and the village and we were by necessity blocking the way.</p><p><em> Hell. That's going to be bad.</em></p><p>"Out of the way!" Tsunade growled.</p><p>Sasuke and I quick stepped, sliding out of the way as Tsunade placed herself directly in the path of the oncoming wave. It was several stories tall now, a solid wall of natural disaster about to ruin our day.</p><p>Tsunade stared it down, waiting until the water we were standing on started to rise into the curl of it – and then she clenched a fist and punched upwards. "Hyah!"</p><p>The wall of water wobbled, like a water balloon under a slow motion camera, and I could feel her chakra along the length of it, as thin and precisely controlled as a scalpel delivered with all the force of a sledgehammer.</p><p>No. 'Sledgehammer' was too gentle.</p><p>The entire wave exploded upwards, coming apart and pelting down as rain. Freezing cold rain that drenched us in seconds – but entirely without the devastating force that would have crushed the island. I licked my lips, tasting salt, and tried to wipe it out of my eyes, but the rain kept coming down. Temari's winds turned them into pinpricks and we'd be in trouble if this fight turned into an endurance slog because people were going to be burning chakra just to stay warm.</p><p>Visibility was awful. We were cold and wet. The wind was howling. It had gone from a pleasant day at the beach to nightmare conditions in no time, and the fight had barely even started yet.</p><p>The Sanbi was on us now, plowing through the first line of mist ninja, their jutsu bouncing harmlessly off of its hide. The spiky shell on its back seemed a natural defense, but even the exposed muscle looking skin was impossibly tough. Water bullets splashing off, water needles failing to find weaknesses to exploit, water lances doing about as much damage as the ocean itself. Some of them were tossed aside, not even attacked, just collateral damage from its movements.</p><p>For a second it seemed like Zabuza had some traction – a giant water dragon rising out of the ocean and winding around the Sanbi's torso – especially when Sasuke copied the jutsu immediately, sending another water dragon out and between the two of them they tried to drag it back. Some kind of long, water whip wrapped around the left front leg.</p><p>Then it screamed again, that wild, animal sound, and spun into a ball, shredding the dragons with the spikes on its back and charging unimpeded to the island. It moved <em> fast,</em> rolling over the water like a cannonball.</p><p>It's chakra felt so… wildly disjointed. So much like the spread out screaming anger, twisting around and around upon itself, that I'd felt on the trip to the island without anything to indicate that it was a real, living creature.</p><p>I body flickered ahead of it - staying parallel and not in front - pushing as fast as I could and slapped up barrier seals, one then another and another. It tore through them like they were less than wet paper, barely slowing let alone stopping, and slammed head first into the cliffside, slightly along from where all the guests had been. Chunks of stone went flying, massive boulders chipped off, and sand and dirt crumbled as it collapsed.</p><p>(And there was that point of reference I'd been looking for, earlier. The Sanbi was as tall as the cliffs of Hidden Mist.)</p><p>An arrow of golden sand whirled past me, homing in on the Sanbi's open eye with terrible and deadly ease. Another thin ribbon of it circled the snout, trying to clamp it closed. Back on the beach, Gaara stood with hand outstretched in our direction. More sand was sluggishly rising through the air, but not much. Certainly not enough.</p><p>And then the Sanbi pulled back. <em> Was</em> pulled back. It's claws – hands – dug into the stone with terrifying ease, but inch by inch they left furrows in the ground as it was dragged backwards.</p><p>Tsunade had it by the tail.</p><p>The water under her feet was strangely still, despite how tumultuous the ocean around her was. How much chakra control did it take to gain enough traction on water to hold back a Tailed Beast? Was she anchoring it all the way down to the bedrock underneath?</p><p>She twisted and <em> heaved</em> , dragging the Sanbi by its tail in a circle and throwing it back out to sea. It didn't go far – I doubted even Tsunade could throw a Bijuu <em> far</em> – but it was enough.</p><p>"Haku! Now!" Mei commanded, even as she spat ropes of binding lava around its neck and legs. They <em> steamed</em> – or the water steamed from them – and turned into black and solid rock as they cooled. She spat more and more, keeping a constant stream going to layer over what had already been applied.</p><p>Giant glittering walls of ice started to rise out of the ocean, surrounding the Sanbi and trapping it. They were serious, solid things, layers and layers of walls, around and underneath it.</p><p>"Restraint team into position!" Zabuza ordered. Four of the Mist ninja moved, circling the Ice Prison at equal distances from him, so that they were forming a pentagram, and beginning a long series of handseals. Whatever they were doing it was clear that it would take time, and that they would need the Sanbi restrained while they did it.</p><p>Haku's ice was very, very strong.</p><p>Except Naruto had broken it. Naruto had broken it with Kyuubi's chakra and so I wasn't at all surprised when they started to crack.</p><p>Horrified, maybe. But not surprised.</p><p>This was the power of a Bijuu. This was why Konoha had been devastated by the Kyuubi. I'd felt it – felt the chakra – but I'd never really <em> known</em> what it was like, to face any enemy that you couldn't touch. That ignored everything you threw at it on such a massive scale.</p><p><em> Seals! That's how they deal with them!</em></p><p>But they were trying to do that. And I didn't know how to seal a Bijuu – that was a scale I couldn't touch. Wasn't the area I'd studied, wasn't a thing I'd looked into. Chakra itself, maybe, but the Sanbi's chakra was so unbalanced, so unstable that none of those seals would possibly work. They'd just collapse.</p><p>The Sanbi's giant head crashed through on of the walls, right eye still stubbornly closed, and pillars of ice and water slammed down around its neck, desperately trying to hold it in place.</p><p>But its head was facing Sasuke, open left eye on display-</p><p>-and it twisted away, right into Mei's lava attack, taking it full in the face.</p><p>Like it knew. Like it avoided him on purpose.</p><p>"Oh," I said. The twisting disjointed chakra, like there was someone else's chakra there. Like someone trapped in a genjutsu. The animalistic behavior. The lack of sapience – Bijuu could <em> talk</em> . Shukaku had been crazy but verbose, <em> intelligent.</em></p><p>There was none of that on display here.</p><p>"Oh," I said, again, as the Sanbi finally burst free of the ice prison, spinning and knocking the ninja around it back, rupturing the slowly forming jutsu like popping a balloon. I caught a glimpse of Tsunade pulling people out of the water, dealing with the injured, but an idea was finally percolating in my mind now.</p><p>I regrouped with Sasuke. "Can you catch it's eye?" I asked, sliding to a stop beside him, both eyes fixed on our quarry. This really didn't seem like the time to take your attention off of it. "I've got-"</p><p>"A plan?" he finished. "I've been trying. But-"</p><p>"Part of a plan, yeah," I said, bobbing my head in a nod.</p><p>He nodded back. Like <em> part of a plan</em> was good enough for him. Good. I was winging it.</p><p>I held my left hand out to him in a half seal - rat for shadow jutsu. After a split second he took it, fingers folding around my own like it was something we'd practiced before. It wasn't. I'd never done this with anyone else – had barely done it on my <em> own.</em> I curled my right hand in towards my chest, around my Gelel stone.</p><p><em> Here goes nothing.</em></p><p>I pushed chakra through the stone, using it to transform into Shadow State. Heart, body, skin, clothes, <em> Sasuke-</em> all shadow. The world muted. Went to grey and noise, sounds transmitted to me from a dozen shadows all at once, an overlapping barrage of noise and information.</p><p><em> Mei-sama, we can't-</em></p><p><em> -move now-</em></p><p>-<em> look out it's going-</em></p><p><em> -going to attack-</em></p><p>I <em> was</em> those shadows, and I spread and regrouped, finding the biggest shadow of them all, carefully tugging Sasuke along in my wake.</p><p>Then upwards – bursting free. Dozens of shadow stitching tendrils looping up and over, tying down the body of the beast, over the snout to hold the mouth closed, around the legs. The shadow underneath primed with paralysis jutsu. As many layers of restraint as I could hope to hold at the same time. Our bodies, sliding back into their real shapes, emerging at the Sanbi's head right in front of the eyes.</p><p>I could feel it's chakra. What was <em> not</em> it's chakra. The looping, chaotic feel of it.</p><p>"<strong> Remember who you are</strong> ," I ordered and pushed our joined hand seal forward, resting on its snout.</p><p>The Sanbi's right eye snapped open.</p><p>Red and circling, its right eye was a spinning sharingan.</p><p>Next to me, I could feel Sasuke's sharingan genjutsu activate, like a car switching into gear, could feel the chakra pulse and settle. It clashed and resonated at the same time, like water entering a channel that was already full.</p><p>And the world around us vanished – went black – and all that was left was us and the Sanbi, trapped in chains, and a looming spectre above us with sharingan eyes.</p><p>"Seal space," I breathed. Though was that right? Was it Genjutsu space? Jinchuriki space? An extra dimensional space, connected but not connected to the real world. A pocket of space-time, however it had been created.</p><p>"What the hell?" Sasuke breathed back, hand tightening on mine. The hand seal wasn't exactly necessary any longer, but I made no move to let go.</p><p>The Sanbi was thrashing in his chains, maybe mirroring the thrashing his body was doing outside. They were worn down and rusted, some of them pulling free, but still so many left to go. We pulled back, away from it, so we didn't get hit by it, and even though this dark space had no real dimensions, we managed to get some distance.</p><p>I took a deep breath. Would this solve our problems? Was this the right thing to do? I had no idea. But there was a very clear path ahead of us.</p><p>"We need to get rid of that," I said, glancing upwards at the almost-certainly-Madara figure. Who else could have trapped the Three Tails in a genjutsu strong enough to last beyond its death and reformation?</p><p>"How?" Sasuke asked, dubiously.</p><p>"… that's a good question." I looked around. There was nothing here but us. "Well, um, sealing relies largely on theoretical understanding and willpower. If this place is a sealing space – or operates by the same rules…"</p><p>"We just… think it away?" Sasuke translated. He rolled his shoulders back, like squaring up for a fight. "Okay."</p><p><em> Will it away</em> , I corrected, mentally, but he wasn't wrong so I didn't correct it. <em> Willpower. The power of my </em> <em> <strong> will.</strong> </em></p><p>The Sanbi thrashed again. Weakly. It seemed so tired. How many years had it been fighting this? Sealed, not just within a Jinchuriki, but within itself?</p><p>I let go of Sasuke's hand and stepped closer. "<strong> Isobu</strong> ," I said. "Please, stop fighting! We're going to get you out of there!"</p><p>I put as much force, as much <em> truth</em> into my words as I could. They seemed so small in this endless dark, under the watchful sharingan eye.</p><p><em> God, that's going to give me nightmares.</em></p><p>Isobu stopped moving and his giant eyes cracked open, just a fraction. "Really?" his voice was surprisingly young and childish. And hopeful. "You'll help Isobu?"</p><p><em> Sapience. Anything that talks can be reasoned with. Work with that.</em></p><p>I managed a smile. "We will," I reaffirmed. "We just want the fighting to stop, okay? If we get you out of there, will you stop attacking us?"</p><p>He seemed to ponder that, which was actually nerve wracking. Like, what was I going to do, if he said 'no'?</p><p>Sasuke was side eyeing me extremely hard. "Is this a good idea?" he hissed under his breath.</p><p>I gave a minute shrug, barely a twitch of my shoulders. "It can hardly make this <em> worse</em> , can it?" I answered, equally quiet.</p><p>Well, it probably could. Then we'd have to fight an <em> intelligent</em> , impenetrable chakra beast. Which was maybe worse than a chakra beast thrashing around in pain? Really, there were just no good options here. And actually, what was going to happen if it <em> did</em> stop fighting? There was just a Bijuu roaming around on the ocean? Somehow I didn't really see that going over well.</p><p><em> One problem at a time.</em></p><p>"Okay," Isobu rumbled. "If you take the chains off, Isobu will stop fighting. It's a promise." He wiggled his front leg out forwards and curled the fingers down except for the smallest.</p><p>Blank faced, I approached and held out my own pinky finger against it, like that was even manageable. His whole entire hand was about as tall as I was. "It's a promise," I agreed.</p><p>Of course, then we had to work out how to actually get the chains off. Grabbing and pulling hardly worked – they were strong and thick and stuck <em> hard</em> … however they were affixed to the ground.</p><p>"Let me try," Sasuke said, drawing the chakra sabre from his back. The blade lit up white and sliced through the chain easily enough, making it crumble and disintegrate into nothingness.</p><p>"Duh," I said, rolling my eyes at myself. We weren't <em> physically</em> here, and neither was our stuff. But mental representations were mental representations and it would work if I <em> thought it would work</em> . Willpower.</p><p>I twisted my hand and flicked my lightsaber on. "Now we're talking."</p><p>Clambering over Isobu to cut the chains wasn't actually all that physically demanding. A bit intimidating, sure, especially since we'd been ineffectively fighting him a minute ago and up close the carapace was still spikey and rough enough to grate your skin off, but he wasn't actually moving, so we didn't get squished or otherwise injured.</p><p>And when the last chain broke apart under our swords, the figure in the sky cracked apart like a kaleidoscope, into a thousand brief and colourful parts –</p><p>- And then we were back on the ocean, cold rain pouring down and the wind buffeting us. My shadow stitching tendrils gave out, collapsing off his back like an oil slick, overextended to the max.</p><p>Isobu opened his eyes. "I'm scared," he said, voice small.</p><p>My hand, joined with Sasuke's in a half seal, was still on his nose. I patted it awkwardly. "I know," I said. "I know."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hidden Mist Arc: Chapter 141</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Extra thanks to Math-Is-Magic for talking me through a tough spot on this chapter.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 141</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better. ~ Albert Camus </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"How long can you hold it?" Zabuza asked us gruffly, half shouting to be heard. The rain was fading to the last pitiful splatters of water, and the wind was down to a mild roar. "Restraint team into position!"</p><p>Four mist ninja regrouped and circled around, forming the pentagram for their technique. Haku's chakra surged and ice started to climb over Isobu's legs again, massive chunks of it, much rougher than anything I'd ever seen Haku make before.</p><p>"Wait! Wait!" I shouted at them. Isobu wasn't reacting – maybe because he trusted we'd stop or maybe because our attacks had done fuck all of nothing so far. I cleared my throat and tried to sound authoritative. "Stand down! Isobu has agreed to stop fighting!"</p><p>There was a brief pause like 'those words don't make sense used in that order'. But no one launched an attack, so that was good.</p><p>I twisted around, looking for the Mizukage since she was, y'know, nominally the one in charge. It meant I had to let go of Sasuke – our seal wasn't useful anymore and it freed up my hands in case I did need to use another technique, which was good – but also meant that my back was to a bijuu – which was slightly uncomfortable. We were still standing in front of his nose. Even ignoring the possible bijuu ball situation there was still the danger of <em> teeth</em> and general slamming.</p><p>"Isobu has agreed to stop fighting," I repeated. And then wondered how the hell I was supposed to actually explain any of this. Should I even explain any of it? "We negotiated a ceasefire," I said, because that sounded nice and professional and it was somewhere to start.</p><p>"Isobu promised," the giant Tailed Beast agreed, still sounding surprisingly young.</p><p>"A ceasefire," Mei repeated, arching an eyebrow and managing to sound only <em> a little</em> incredulous. "With the Sanbi."</p><p>It did sound ridiculous, yes. I fixed a smile on my face because I didn't have a good counter for that.</p><p>"Why not?" I said, winningly. "Neither side wants hostilities to continue." I spread my hands like <em> what can you do</em> . "Isobu had a corrupted seal on him – probably the remnants of a Jinchuriki seal – that was meant he was lashing out. Sasuke and I were able to stabilize it in return for his cooperation."</p><p>Mei had a tiny splash of lava at the corner of her mouth and she wiped it away with her index finger slowly, either an unconscious motion as she thought or stalling for time. I was momentarily distracted wondering if <em> heat resistance</em> was a natural part of her bloodlimit – it was lava <em> on her skin</em> – or if she had a separate technique for that.</p><p>Probably bloodlimit. How else would you be able to spit lava if it burnt you- <em> Not. The. Time. Shikako. </em></p><p>"We certainly don't wish to continue fighting," she agreed, almost idly, watching Isobu with a very sharp and calculating expression. "We are, after all, a new and <em> peaceful</em> Hidden Mist. In the middle of commemorating our new regime, in fact."</p><p>"Well. There you go. Uh, this is Mei Terumi, the Fifth Mizukage," I introduced, feeling <em> only slightly</em> ridiculous for defaulting to <em> manners</em> right now. Did they know each other? I didn't know. "And this is Isobu, the Three Tailed Turtle."</p><p>Isobu lowered his giant head down, making the water swell out, and blinked a giant eye at her. "I know you," he said. "You killed Yagura." He sounded reproachful. "He was my friend."</p><p>Well. That was a nice three seconds of peace while it lasted.</p><p>"I did," Mei agreed, unexpectedly meeting the accusation head on instead of trying to excuse it or reason around it, "and I killed you as well. Right here."</p><p>"Yagura was trapped too, wasn't he, Isobu?" I asked, softly, trying to provide a more sympathetic counterpoint to such a bald faced truth. "Like you were." I reached out again to put a hand on his face, felt the scratch of rough scales against the palm of my hand. I had no idea if it helped – a giant turtle didn't exactly have <em> facial expressions</em> to read.</p><p>There wasn't much else I could say – 'I'm sorry' might have helped but it wasn't mine to say – and things like 'it needed to be done' might have been true but would be really unlikely to make anything better. I certainly wouldn't have liked to hear it.</p><p>"He was my friend," Isobu repeated, but smaller. Lonelier. Resigned, more than angry.</p><p>Which was good for us but still.</p><p>"We can be friends," Sasuke spoke up and glared at me like it was my fault. <em> I</em> hadn't made him offer. "It's not the same, but we could be friends."</p><p>"Isobu would like that," the giant chakra demon whispered.</p><p>"Let me introduce you to everyone, then," I said, a giddy mix of solemnity and relief. Maybe we'd talked our way out of this one after all. "This is Haku-"</p><p>Haku, being the champion that he was, bowed and smiled. "Any friend of yours is a friend of mine," he said. "I am pleased to meet you."</p><p>Then he took over, which was good since I didn't actually know the names of most of the other mist ninja. The ones that were in the bingo book, sure, but most of the rank and file? Nope.</p><p>Tsunade finished ensuring all the ninja who had been smacked around during the fighting weren't badly hurt and hauled the last mist nin to his feet by the collar of his vest. "Walk it off," she instructed. He looked pretty dazed, which could have been from the bijuu, the healing or her bedside manner.</p><p>I could sympathise. I knew that feeling.</p><p>Simply thinking that must have turned her attention to me – or she'd dealt with all the more urgent cases – because then we had a Hokage right in front of us. We moved slightly away so that the introductions could continue without us. Wasn't exactly a private conversation, but it was the best we could do.</p><p>"Injuries?" Tsunade asked crisply.</p><p>I actually took a second to think about it. I hadn't actually participated in the fighting until the very end and while the Shadow State and massive Shadow Stitching had taken a fair chunk of chakra, it hadn't taken <em> everything. </em></p><p>"None," I said, pleased.</p><p>She didn't actually look convinced, and pressed a glowing hand to my forehead. Her chakra swept through me but didn't catch on anything because I wasn't actually lying. She repeated the procedure with Sasuke, also finding nothing.</p><p>"You will have to explain this later," she said quietly, lips barely moving. "But for now… good job."</p><p>A little bit of tension I didn't know I was carrying faded away. Tsunade approved. That wasn't nothing.</p><p>Mei edged her way closer to us, still watching Isobu closely as he was introduced to her ninja. Most of them were keeping their distance. "How certain are you that he won't attack?" She asked.</p><p>"I don't think he's any more likely to attack than any other ninja you've invited," I hedged.</p><p>"Hmm," she said, with a very great deal of consideration.</p><p>"Mei," Zabuza said, low and growling and almost <em> warningly.</em> He wasn't looking our way and probably shouldn't have even been able to hear what she'd said.</p><p>The Mizukage glanced at him sideways and blinked, sly, catlike amusement. "But darling, it's our <em> wedding.</em> "</p><p>Isobu turned back to us. "Isobu has never been to a wedding before," he said, tucking his hands underneath himself. Like a cat loaf. And utterly destroying all the ice that Haku had seeded around him in the process, without even seeming to notice that it was there. It was hard to forget that he was a terrifying force of nature, of course, but… he wasn't putting a lot of effort into being intimidating, either.</p><p>Mei smiled. "Isobu, I would be <em> delighted</em> to invite you to my wedding."</p><p>That was… a hell of a gamble. If anything happened – if Isobu started fighting again, if he <em> accidentally</em> caused damage – there were a whole lot of very important guests that could get hurt and if anything happened to them the reputation of Hidden Mist would take a beating they could hardly afford. On the other hand, if nothing happened, all those very important guests (including the Tsuchikage) would see that Hidden Mist was just palling around with a bijuu.</p><p>And it would certainly counter the damage done by the interruption to the wedding in the first place.</p><p>Mei clapped her hands together, a single sharp sound. "Then let's go have a wedding."</p><p><hr /></p><p>"Our most sincere apologies for the delay," Mei said, as the guests were gently ushered back down to the beach. We'd rescued what furniture had survived destruction and set up again, and tried to make ourselves presentable. The mist nin had known a nifty chakra trick to draw water out of clothes, so we were at least <em> dry</em> . "There was a brief rain shower, but fortunately the weather has cleared up again so we can resume!"</p><p>She smiled prettily.</p><p>Mostly… they seemed to be buying it. Or at least pacified by the 'no, you were totally not in any danger' explanations. It didn't need to be convincing; it just needed to be reassuring.</p><p>The Tsuchikage on the other hand, was absolutely irritable. "You have a bijuu! Just sitting there!" he spluttered at her. "What is the meaning of this?"</p><p>"Isobu is a valued member of my village," Mei said, voice filled with shock, one hand coming to her chest as though she were struck with offense. "It's <em> policy</em> of the new Kirigakure to welcome back members who may have left over disagreements with the previous regime. I'm sure we already agreed on this, Onoki-dono."</p><p>I was sure absolutely no one had ever intended that to apply to a bijuu, so I was highly amused that she had. His sheer disbelief at the <em> gall</em> of it only made it better. Kurotsuchi and Akatsuchi didn't look much happier, even while wearing appropriately stoic expressions.</p><p>"And I'd like to give a special thank you to the Kazekage for the replacement seating," Mei added, since a great deal of it was just… floating sand, including the stuff out over the water where we were, with Isobu. I guess he'd spent so much effort <em> making</em> more sand that it was a shame to do nothing with it. It was pretty amusing how many ninja just Did Not Want to touch it, though. "So if we can all return to our places…"</p><p>Given the dramatics, the wedding was over <em> fast.</em> Or rather, in comparison to the effort it'd taken to get here, anything would have seemed anti-climactic. They exchanged vows and sake cups and just as they were walking back across the water to the shore, gentle flakes of snow started to fall.</p><p>In October.</p><p>I looked at Haku. He was smiling serenely, even as guests ooh and ahhed about it. I caught a flake on my hand, and inspected it closely. This close to Isobu, my chakra sense was practically deafened – but for just a little while, this beach felt like Haku. Maybe intentional. Maybe not.</p><p>"It's a miracle," I said, teasingly.</p><p>There was a reception, but due to the Isobu situation, Sasuke and I didn't end up going. Anko and Sakura were speedily promoted to bodyguard / mingling duty, which was something I didn't even mind at all. Even Haku had to go being replaced by Ao - who had so far been kept at a diplomatic distance from the Konoha delegation - and Chojuro.</p><p>More surprisingly – or less, maybe – was that Gaara stayed on the beach.</p><p>"You do have to go, eventually," Temari said, but with the kind of practical understanding of someone who knew that would be exactly if and when he wanted to go and not a moment sooner, no matter how diplomatically necessary it might have been. "Can't hide out here all night."</p><p>"We won't even make you dance," Kankurou agreed. "You can just glare at everyone from underneath the hat and sulk in the corner."</p><p>Gaara ignored them both. In fact, he walked towards Isobu who regarded him with a faint interest. Gaara didn't seem exactly fussed with the whole 'giant bijuu' situation but then again he'd dealt with this before. Every day. Inside his head.</p><p>"I would accuse you of planning this stunt except it's kind of over the top even for you, sparky," Kankurou said.</p><p>I turned to him, puzzled. "What?" I glanced at Sasuke, he didn't seem to get it either.</p><p>"Hidden Leaf gets accused of evil mass destruction," Kankurou said, ticking down a finger, "then you very publicly solve a disaster in the most peaceful way possible. It'd be suspicious if I thought there was any possible way you could have done it."</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him. "Summoning bijuu out of the ether is a little beyond my ability, sorry," I said. "I'm pretty sure our plan was just to smile and look harmless."</p><p>The risk inherent in setting up a situation like that – even minus chakra monsters – was too massive to even think about attempting under the eyes of the greatest ninja in the elemental nations. Someone would work out you were playing them.</p><p>And besides. It's not like both things couldn't be true.</p><p>"Well, I think you blew that one," Kankurou said, glancing at Isobu. "But it looks like they're done talking so we're probably going to head inside and eat fancy party food. Have fun out here."</p><p>Strains of music and party-noise were drifting out from the hotel. It made the atmosphere a little <em> lonely</em> , all of us outside, kept at a distance.</p><p>I hummed, dipping my hand into the ocean and curling chakra into a ball of water. I drew it out into a ribbon, compressed it back into a ball and juggled it. Ao was watching me sharply, but Chojuro looked more interested than suspicious, so I magnanimously decided that that was probably just his face.</p><p>"Sasuke," I grinned. "Fire dancing. But with water."</p><p>He scoffed at me, but he was already drawing water into his hands to do the same.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Once all the partying had been had and all the little daimyos sent off to bed or whatever, the Mizukage came back.</p><p>Her smile might have looked slightly fixed, but I didn't know her well enough to tell. Zabuza looked grumpy, but that wasn't exactly the shock of the year.</p><p>"Thank you for standing guard," she said to us. "You can turn in now; get some sleep."</p><p>It was a clear dismissal, so we saluted and left. I guessed that after several hours of not rampaging and killing everyone, they'd decided Isobu probably wasn't going to start now.</p><p>Tsunade was waiting in the hotel suite for us, Anko lounging casually against the wall and Sakura blinking sleepily on the couch.</p><p>"Any problems?" Tsunade asked, when we let ourselves into the room.</p><p>"Nope," I said, shaking my head. "Do you know what the plan is from here?"</p><p>Tsunade waved Anko away, and she took a yawning Sakura with her back to the contestant barracks, before taking a seat on the sofa herself. "They'll undoubtedly try and make a Jinchuriki," she said. "Though if they can put the sealing off until we're all gone, they will."</p><p>"So no one interferes?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"And so no one can study it," I guessed. "The restraining technique they were trying to use before would have only been part of it."</p><p>"Most likely," Tsunade agreed. "So. What can you tell me about the seal that the Sanbi was trapped under?"</p><p>I hesitated.</p><p>"It wasn't a seal," Sasuke said. He crossed his arms, frowning.</p><p>The Hokage blinked at us, still and serious. "Run that past me again."</p><p>"It wasn't <em> not</em> a seal," I temporalized. "I mean, effectively, the way it was implemented <em> made</em> it a seal, even if it might not have been a conventional paper-and-ink one. And seals are really only just-" I cut myself off because it was probably not the time to digress into fuuinjutsu theory. "But uh… it was a genjutsu. And Isobu's right eye…"</p><p>Tsunade looked at Sasuke. "That wasn't you?"</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>"We managed to… interact with the technique," I said, because finding words to describe what had happened was <em> hard.</em> "Metaphysically. And while we were there, there was a specter, the remnants of the person who cast the genjutsu. He definitely had the advanced form of the sharingan."</p><p>"Can you identify him?" Tsunade asked.</p><p>I considered and then shook my head. "It didn't show his face, or anything like that. Just the eye. And the… form of the eye was different than Kakashi-sensei's. Than Itachi's."</p><p>"There weren't that many who unlocked that level of sharingan," Sasuke said, uncomfortably.</p><p>"That's not good," Tsunade said, which was a masterful understatement. "If Mist thinks that Konoha is responsible…" she frowned, thoughtfully. "But it doesn't make very much sense at all. Especially if Yagura…"</p><p>"It felt <em> old,</em> " I added, shifting slightly. That was… more of a guess than not, actually. "Like it had been there for a long time. It had started to wear away a bit but it was still pretty strong. You'd have to ask Isobu how long he'd been trapped."</p><p>Tsunade sighed and dragged a hand over her face. "This is all classified," she declared wearily. "I don't want it mentioned to anyone."</p><p>"Yes, Hokage-sama," we chorused.</p><p>I hesitated but asked anyway. "Does Hidden Mist know about Akatsuki? If- if they're going to end up with a Jinchuriki…"</p><p>"They're aware," Tsunade said, somewhat dryly. "And even if they weren't, the Kazekage also has opinions on the topic. Don't concern yourself with it."</p><p>When did I ever 'not concern myself' with something? But I accepted her words as reassuring enough. This particular avenue was covered, or something like it.</p><p>"Get some rest," she added, without moving from the couch. "We're heading home tomorrow."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Hidden Mist Arc: Chapter 142</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 142</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> There is nothing permanent except change. ~ </em> <em> Heraclitus </em></p><p><hr /></p><p>The trip back to shore was boring which I guessed was better than it being exciting.</p><p>Haku had turned over the pleasure of escorting us back to Chojuro, in favour of a vague 'new responsibilities' that in the absence of other information I took to mean 'that whole bijuu situation'.</p><p>Which was understandable but a shame. There hadn't been a whole lot of socialisation time during the trip. We weren't even on the same ferry back as the Sand Siblings - probably because Hidden Mist wanted to keep all ninja parties separate just in case - so there was no option to talk to them either.</p><p>It was a chattier group we were with this time, though. Sakura, Isaribi and Yakumo were more than willing to fill us in on what had happened during the first and second exams.</p><p>"I guess it wasn't quite as explosive as any of your exams," Sakura said, somewhat slyly.</p><p>I forced a smile. Sakura didn't mean anything by it. It was an old joke, started way back at the Academy. I doubted she even <em> really</em> remembered how it started. It was the kind of thing people just repeated, because it was funny, until it took a life of its own.</p><p>Only it wasn't funny now.</p><p>It really, <em> really</em> was not funny.</p><p>And also - it was dangerous.</p><p>"I've rebranded," I chided, trying vainly to keep my tone light. "Didn't you know? I'm a kenjutsu user now." I groped about, trying to come up with reasoning Sakura would like. "A far more ancient and elegant art, with legendary blades passed down from the hands of masters..."</p><p>She practically sparkled, hands clasping together and eyes wide.</p><p>"I don't know if anyone would call your fight with Zabuza 'elegant'," Sasuke said, deadpan. I tried to glare at him, but I was too relieved he was pitching in to help shift the conversation to really manage it.</p><p>"Elegant and mysterious," I insisted, which was generally only the point of view of people who had never seen a sword used on a battlefield. Or maybe there were people that found stabbing to be elegant. The world had all kinds. "Oh, did I ever tell you about the time I ran into a wandering swordsmith? He'd been accused of murder-"</p><p>The story of Sazanami - stripped of pretty much all identifying features and information in order to make it acceptable to tell in public - made an exceptional distraction and conversational redirection.</p><p>I really owed that dude a lot.</p><p>The rest of the trip back went much the same - no mysterious clouds of chakra, no bijuu, no ambushes - and Anko put her team in charge of setting up camp claiming they needed the practice, which was fine by me. And we got to observe Tsunade teaching Sakura some medical jutsu, because apparently winning the chunin exams was no excuse to interrupt her mentorship schedule.</p><p>Returning to Konoha was... a little uncomfortable. After the hostility at the exams, the atmosphere at home should have seemed <em> less</em> abrasive, not more, but somehow it didn't work that way.</p><p>When Tsunade called us back to her office several days later, I was hopeful. Though it was as ourselves, not as Hawk and Bat. Which led me to believe that it was a debriefing from the mission past and not actually a new mission.</p><p>I was half right.</p><p>"I can't promote you," Tsunade said, bluntly. "You understand that, don't you?" She seemed tired, which was probably from catching up after being away for a week, without even the additional stuff that had happened during the exam. "I can't send you out of the village. At the ranks you have, that's doable. If you're Jounin…" she trailed off.</p><p>I nodded, exchanging a look with Sasuke.</p><p>We had bigger targets on our backs than we could handle. We were good, sure, but we weren't <em> shrug off a bijuu</em> good. Only now, everyone thought we were.</p><p>It was no wonder that Tsunade didn't want to send us anywhere.</p><p>"I'm… not pushing for a promotion," I said, somewhat uncertainly.</p><p>She scoffed but looked amused. "You might not be, but your actions are," she said, which… okay I could understand that too. Again. The 'shrug off a bijuu' thing. "At some point, it's out of your hands. Once you reach a certain level, questions start being asked about effective utilisation of shinobi and their skills."</p><p>"So what do we do?" Sasuke asked, because it was pretty clear we couldn't <em> unfight</em> Isobu.</p><p>Tsunade smiled thinly. "So glad you asked." She lifted a scroll off of her desk and held it out.</p><p>Sasuke hesitated before taking it. I could see why – the scroll had his clan symbol on it. Or a modified version of it; red and white fan on a dark star background.</p><p>"If I'm promoting you, you're going to earn it," Tsunade said. "A jounin has to demonstrate that they're a leader of people, that they're beneficial to the whole of the village. They have to contribute, to develop, to push forward and establish changes."</p><p>"Or re-establish, as it were," I murmured, seeing pretty clearly where this was going.</p><p>Tsunade nodded. "For the next six months, your assigned mission is to draft a proposal for the re-establishment of the Konoha Military Police. Make no mistake," she added, dryly, "six months is not a deadline. I know that you're both terrible overachievers and like to perform miracles within the week, but I <em> do not want</em> you finished earlier. This is effectively, a six month moratorium on your promotion, nothing more, nothing less. You can put this scroll in a dark corner and forget about it." She considered. "Though I wouldn't recommend it, given that everyone is going to know you're supposed to be working on it."</p><p>"Hmm," I said, tapping my chin.</p><p>What <em> did</em> Konoha do now, with no police force? I'd had a bit of experience with the judicial arm, which was different. And the prison, which was run by Intel. And Ibiki, checking up on my on-mission actions when they'd thought I'd interrogated someone. Actually, what was the scope of the police force, even? Civilian crimes? Ninja crimes? Ninja on civilian crimes? Crimes within Konoha?</p><p>"Dismissed," Tsunade added.</p><p>"Well," I said, as we left her office. "I think I know where we should <em> start.</em> "</p><p><hr /></p><p>I received my copy of the new issue of the Konoha Bingo Book and cautiously checked my own page. It… wasn't as bad as expected, which was probably a given with how Tsunade was trying to downplay everything. But it was <em> there</em> , which was new and concerning.</p><p>But that also meant that it was time for the annual Special Jounin 'laugh at stupid Bingo Book pages' party again. They'd hired out a pub again, and I wove through the crowds to pick up a soda from the bar.</p><p>I glanced around, searching the room until I caught myself and realized I was looking for someone who couldn't possibly be here.</p><p>There were no ghosts in this crowd. My chakra sense removed all doubt. And yet. I still felt like there was - or if not a ghost then an empty space where Aoba should have been. Last time I'd been here, he'd been the one to invite me, the one to make sure I came.</p><p><em> You need to check this out,</em> he'd have said,<em> they've updated-</em></p><p>-and the illusion blew away because I didn't know what he would have said, what they would have updated or for who. There was only a gap where his knowledge should have been, the carefully collected knowledge of a lifetime, erased into dust and ash.</p><p>I wondered how many empty spaces were in this room, how many not-ghosts walking around that I didn't know to miss.</p><p>I sipped my drink and contemplated just… going home.</p><p>But no. That wasn't productive. I needed to stay, to associate with my comrades and to learn what they thought and how they felt about the current situation.</p><p>There was a nearly empty table to the side of the room, and I slid in across from Ibiki in a near replica of the last year.</p><p>I didn't think I had seen Ibiki since the hospital, if that could be called 'seeing'.</p><p>And that was…</p><p>It wasn't like I could hold it against him - it was his <em> job</em> to figure out how people ticked. Heck, he'd already had <em> me</em> in an interrogation room once already. Just because we were on the same side didn't mean it would never be turned on me.</p><p>I was fooling myself if I ever thought otherwise. That wasn't how ninja friendships worked.</p><p>And yeah, Ibiki asking questions <em> had</em> sent me crashing further. Would I have recovered faster, better, if he hadn't been so good at his job? I didn't know, and I didn't think anyone else did either. It was in the past now, there was no way to go back and try another strategy. We just had to live with what we'd done.</p><p>And really. What were his actions against that?</p><p>"Hey," I said, shrugging one shoulder.</p><p>Ibiki nodded, gravely. "Hello."</p><p>Well. Hopefully that meant it was settled. I didn't actually want to <em> have a conversation</em> about it. Especially not here.</p><p>I took another sip of my drink. Rolled the cool glass between my palms. Watched the bingo books get passed around the crowd. Listened to the reactions and outrage and hoots of laughter.</p><p>And then the bar door burst open. "Guess who!" Anko shouted, coat flapping. She struck a pose. "You can all call me Anko-sensei!"</p><p>"Special Jounin only!" someone from the crowd shouted. I suspected Genma. "No Jounin allowed!"</p><p>"The Jounin party is boring!" Anko shouted back. "And I know you miss me!"</p><p>The crowd jeered. But in a friendly way, because there was plenty of backslapping and congratulations thrown around and Anko was beaming brightly. They were happy for her, for her promotion.</p><p>Eventually she struggled through, a free drink in one hand and a blue Mist Bingo Book in the other. "Ibiki! Still hiding in a corner, huh?"</p><p>She slapped the book down on the table, triumphantly. "Check this out." It fell open to Haku's page. I read over it, the picture of his gentle smiling face at odds with how terrifying he sounded on paper.</p><p>"Huh," I said. "I didn't think they'd put that in the Bingo Book."</p><p><em> Host to Isobu - the Three Tailed Turtle.</em></p><p>Ibiki arched an eyebrow. "It's an imposing threat," he said. "Exactly the kind of detail that Bingo Book advertising is <em> for.</em> The only nation that doesn't list it's Jinchuriki is Konoha and I suspect that will change before too long."</p><p>Fair point.</p><p>I wasn't sure how I felt about it though – Tsunade had said that they would do it and I'd suspected it would be Haku. It made me worry for the target it put on him, but both Naruto and Gaara had the same target and that was… just something that had to be dealt with.</p><p>For Isobu…</p><p>It wasn't like they could have just left him roaming free. Not just because of the potential threat of Isobu returning (that was mostly allayed by being able to actually talk to him) but the fact that <em> someone</em> would have ended up sealing him if they didn't. If it wasn't Akatsuki it would have been Hidden Cloud.</p><p>I'd bet they'd be down off the mountain with their bijuu sealing jar instantly, if they'd realized he was loose.</p><p>Bijuu weren't just wildcards. They were weapons. And Hidden Cloud did like to collect those.</p><p><em> Maybe</em> Isobu could have left - the ocean was massive - but... I wondered. Was it coincidence that all the bijuu were still <em> here</em> , in the elemental nations? It had been a long, long time since the sage had created them, and less than a hundred since humans had discovered jinchuriki. Had they just not wanted to leave? Had they left and returned? <em> Could</em> they leave?</p><p>Irrelevant, now, I guessed.</p><p>It had been done. And it hadn't been my decision. Maybe it was one of the unsolvable problems that we'd have to work on – what to do with the tailed beasts that wasn't endlessly caging them – alongside world peace. Maybe Naruto would have an idea, after talking with Kurama.</p><p>A problem, as they said, for future me.</p><p>Anko disappeared into the crowd again. I nodded to Ibiki, fortified myself and got up to <em> mingle</em> .</p><p><hr /></p><p>Life in Konoha continued at a pretty breakneck pace. I wrote seals for the clan until my arm fell off - metaphorically -, completed assignments for medical training at the last minute and dreaded when they surpassed what I already knew, because learning medical jutsu was a full time job in itself and not something easily squeezed between about four other full time jobs, trained, trained with Sasuke, trained with my ANBU squad, subbed in at the tower, and tried to find five minutes to work on this new Police Force thing.</p><p>You would think 'so what did the Police Force <em> do</em> ?' would have been an easy question to answer. You would also be wrong.</p><p>By unspoken agreement, we didn't actually start with the physical police buildings, which put a bit of a damper on things, but was understandable. I'd figured the Konoha side would have had equal records, anyway, but that wound up being a nightmare and a half. Even with Tsunade's 'mission' providing authorization for access, getting departments to fess up records was a headache - and then trying to find out anything relevant, or trying to work out what had <em> changed</em> when... things had changed over.</p><p>The Konoha Military Police had had an uneasy symbiosis with half of Konoha, from the sounds of things.</p><p>Even just <em> asking</em> the older cohort that had been around and worked with them... didn't give a lot of answers. The Police (and the Uchiha) had been pretty insular.</p><p>Which meant we probably <em> would</em> have to tackle the old Uchiha properties to get anything in the way of answers.</p><p>So it was no wonder I was perfectly willing to drop it all when Hawk-taicho told me we had a mission.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

It was quiet, the security seals muffling everything outside of this room. "Are you mission ready?"</p><p>"At your word," Hawk-taicho confirmed.</p><p>She nodded and clasped her hands together. "There's no mission scroll for you today - your orders are verbal only, so listen carefully."</p><p>I had no point of reference to tell if that was <em> unusual</em> for ANBU, and no one else reacted, though the fact that she was stating it meant that it probably was? Tsunade wasn't the type to repeat obvious information more than necessary.</p><p>"This is a stealth and sabotage mission," Tsunade began. "Highly sensitive. Highly classified. You're being deployed to the Land of Earth – I don't need to stress how little Konoha can afford to have ANBU noticed in the area."</p><p>"We'll be discrete," Hawk-taicho said.</p><p>Tsunade snorted softly, a clue that she was very aware of who, exactly, she was sending on this mission. "Your mission is the destruction or disruption of the river ports at Kaikou and Kawaguchi, or to otherwise cause disruption to the shipping trade of Earth Country."</p><p>Kaikou and Kawaguchi were both ports along the Furukawa River – also known colloquially as 'the Belt' because it ran horizontally along most of the Land of Earth, from the Kouhou Mountain in the west to the Iriumi Gulf in the east. It was part of a pretty important trade route, internally because Land of Earth was pretty mountainous and difficult to carry goods across land <em> and</em> internationally because ships could run straight across the Gulf from Land of Earth to Land of Lightning, which helped explain why those two countries tended to ally against the rest of us more than not, despite being in opposite corners of the map.</p><p>I mean, being in opposite corners probably helped. It meant that there was a lot to conquer between them before they ever started competing for resources.</p><p>"The reasons for these targets are two fold," Tsunade went on, tapping her fingers on her desk. "Most obviously, to deprive Hidden Cloud of resources. Secondly, to force Onoki to keep an eye closer to home. We've had intelligence that Hidden Rock has sent ambassadors to Hidden Cloud, no doubt to discuss alliances. An attack at this juncture is nearly as likely to come from Hidden Cloud itself, disguised as an enemy attack, as it is to come from Konoha. Which Onoki would be perfectly aware of."</p><p>Which meant that our actions – the true enemy attack – could actually be suspected to be from the nominal ally of Hidden Cloud. Convoluted, but yes, it wasn't like the Raikage would pass up the chance to put some pressure on an ally to make them side with him.</p><p>"Understood," Hawk-taicho said.</p><p>Tsunade leant back in her chair. "I will reiterate - It is <em> imperative</em> that Konoha is not associated with anything that may be perceived as an attack. If you believe it is impossible to proceed with your mission under those conditions, abort the mission and return to Konoha. Any changes to mission parameters while in the field will be at the discretion of your squad captain."</p><p>She dismissed us and we ghosted out of her office, to the ANBU headquarters, to gear up. We made a quick stop at the quartermasters, because the kind of thing you needed to destroy entire ports weren't the kind of stuff people regularly carried around.</p><p>"What do you need?" Kawauso asked. "Any special mission requests?"</p><p>"Demolition charges," Hawk said. "High yield." He tilted his mask sideways, towards me. "Any preferences?"</p><p>I paused. "I can work with anything, but Unkyaku type tend to be favoured by Hidden Cloud."</p><p>"Those for her," Hawk agreed. "Standard for the rest of us."</p><p>I scribbled my ANBU ID number – separate and distinct from my normal ninja ID – down on the required requisition form and Kawauso retrieved the charges from a security sealed vault.</p><p>"You also get these," Kawauso said, slapping four stacks of paper down on the table. They were seal tag sized, maybe half a dozen in each. "Hokage's orders. These are now part of your standard loadout."</p><p>Hawk-taicho picked them up and flicked through. "The new Nara barrier seals?" he asked, only sounding <em> a little</em> surprised. Towa and Komachi crowded a little closer, to inspect them.</p><p>"Know about them?" Kawauso asked, like that wasn't entirely expected. "Guess you don't need a demonstration, then. What about the rest of you?"</p><p>"I might," I said, and managed to keep my voice absolutely flat.</p><p>Sure, the only person who would understand why that was funny was Sasuke, but I could tell he appreciated it. Or didn't appreciate it in a way that <em> I</em> appreciated.</p><p>That did actually prompt Kawauso to lay out the seal tags and explain what they were and how to use them, but I figured he had to do that regardless. He had a pretty good spiel anyway, and I resolved to steal it if I ever had to hand them out to people.</p><p>"The downside," he added at the end. "No one else has barrier tags like this. If you use them, it's as good as a neon sign that you're from Konoha."</p><p>Which would be something very important for this mission in particular, given that Tsunade had been pretty firm about that whole 'not being seen' thing.</p><p>We split up, briefly, to grab the rest of our mission packs, and met up again near the ANBU gates, flickering our seals at the ANBU on duty.</p><p>"Ready?" Hawk asked. "Any last questions?"</p><p>"'Changes to mission parameters at the discretion of the squad captain'," Towa repeated softly, echoing Tsunade's words from the mission briefing earlier. "She gave you a lot of rope to hang yourself with, taicho." He might have sounded vaguely troubled – but bringing it up again almost certainly meant he'd been turning it over since the meeting.</p><p>I paused and looked back at him. "Was that unusual?" I asked, because I had graduated the Kakashi Hatake school of mission completion which generally amounted to 'do what you feel like, explain it when you get back'.</p><p>Hawk grunted. "Only if we screw it up," he dismissed.</p><p><em> Fair.</em></p><p>"It's a little unusual," Komachi agreed. "But then, we haven't been working with Hawk-taicho for long, either."</p><p>So yeah, <em> not</em> ANBU standard then. Good to know.</p><p><hr /></p><p>We left Konoha straight into the forest, not even touching the roads leaving the village. Or any of the other roads crossing the countryside. Part of the whole 'secret black ops' deal.</p><p>It didn't exactly make things <em> difficult</em> but it was a difference, the same way that we stopped talking, only communicating through handsigns. It made the whole mission feel… more serious. More secret.</p><p>Not that our normal missions <em> hadn't</em> been serious. They had been. It just felt… different.</p><p>We headed north, stopping at the Konoha outpost on the border – or stopping <em> near</em> it and sending Taicho to secretly talk to the outpost commander – to grab up to date intel on the Rock troop movements. And to let them know that we were passing through. Officially, we weren't here, of course, but security measures <em> ought</em> to be able to identify ninja passing through or they weren't good security measures.</p><p>It was definitely a more <em> fraught</em> crossing than any I'd done before – we went north through Land of Waterfalls (because our other options were Rain or Grass and neither of those were <em> good</em> choices) and then into Land of Earth from there. That at least put us on the east coast of the country, near the Iriumi Gulf, which was where we needed to be for part of our mission, anyway.</p><p>We were running at maximum stealth – all using our best stealth jutsu, all signs suppressed, and doing our absolute best to muffle our footsteps in case the vibrations were monitored – and wove around known outposts and any other people we sensed along the way.</p><p>Since we didn't end up fighting… it must have worked.</p><p>Land of Earth was, as expected, pretty mountainous. Craggy, might have been the word for it, with a lot of bare rock and jutting spikes. Which broke up the horizon, sure, but there wasn't a lot of growth and <em> cover</em> for immediate concealment.</p><p>We made camp, carefully, in a mountainside nook that was hard to spot except from basically directly above, with rock pattern camouflage blankets and careful perimeter traps to prevent anyone from stumbling upon us.</p><p>No fire, of course, so we ate our rations cold and planned for our next move.</p><p>Hawk unfolded a map, spreading it flat on the ground. "We need to scout out Kawaguchi Port before we make any moves," he said. "The port town is pretty large, and security will be high, so it's going to be difficult to get close enough to complete our mission. We'll approach from the southern cliffs, see if we can get eyes on the target."</p><p>In some ways, it didn't feel any different from any other camp. Setup, bedrolls, watch rotation. Perfectly routine.</p><p>In others… we were so alone. Cut off. This was it, us in the middle of enemy territory. No backup, no contacts, no nothing.</p><p>It was still another half a day travel to the river, but by mid-afternoon we'd managed to scout ourselves a position where we could overlook the port town on the river mouth, if we were very, very careful. The southern cliffs were high and dropped away steeply edge along the river and the port was on the north side, where the riverbank was a semi-gradual slope up into a wide open flat where the town itself was built, before the ground burst up into another series of mountains.</p><p><em> Security; high</em> , Komachi signed, both a warning and a question.</p><p>She was right.</p><p>There were a lot of ninja down there.</p><p>We'd expected high security – the ports were important infrastructure, after all – but there was still more than would reasonably be expected. Which begged the question of <em> why.</em></p><p>There were standard guard outposts, and whatever passed for ninja customs officials. There were town patrols. And there were at least two jounin and a dozen chunin that weren't filling any of those positions. That seemed too many to just be off duty or relief.</p><p>We waited.</p><p>There was no time frame on our mission – though the longer it took the more likely we were to be noticed – and surveillance was too important to even be called <em> boring.</em> We waited, still and silent, overlooking the port, as the people below milled about and the sun sank towards the horizon.</p><p>Late in the afternoon a ship came into dock, ninja springing up on the deck. But they weren't wearing the brown vests of Rock ninja but <em> white</em> asymmetric ones. At least four of them, a full squad lead by a jounin. A recognizable one at that – a large man carrying swords and a massive chakra signal.</p><p>The cloud nin disembarked. Killer B was met by the two 'extra' jounin, greeting them with what seemed to be exuberance. The three ninja that followed him were less easy to recognize at a distance, but smart money put them as his students.</p><p>And then, horrifyingly, he turned, as though surveying the river and cliff – and paused, right when he would have been looking at us.</p><p>I pressed down flat, stopped breathing and didn't move, chakra pulled in tight and all stealth jutsu up and active.</p><p>Killer B looked away.</p><p>The moment stretched out. No one down below reacted. Had he seen us? Had he not? Had it just been… looking?</p><p>It shouldn't have been possibly for him to see us – but <em> possible</em> was a shaky concept when applied to ninja, and especially when applied to S-rank ninja.</p><p><em> Withdraw,</em> Hawk-taicho signaled, and we wormed our way backwards off the clifftops, slowly and carefully, and regrouped, well out of line of sight.</p><p>"Cloud ninja," Komachi said, voice low with irritation. "Of course they have to show their faces while we're in the area."</p><p>"We're can't risk engaging them," Hawk said. "Especially not with Killer B there. We can't really afford to get close – if he noticed that we were there…"</p><p>"If they're ambassadors," Towa said, slowly, "that means they'll be heading upriver to Hidden Rock. If not…"</p><p>If not, then the whole 'alliance' thing was probably further along than we'd anticipated.</p><p>"We can wait them out," Hawk-taicho suggested. "Plant the explosives once they've left the port. It would be doubly suspicious for the demolition to happen once they've just been there."</p><p><em> Too </em> suspicious, really. The chain of logic between who planted them was so solid that, inversely, it would <em> make</em> it look like a set up. Even though it was.</p><p><em> Goddamn ninja logic.</em></p><p>I pointed that out. "And Killer B is eccentric but he's no fool. They'll protest their innocence and use it to their advantage in the negotiations. Especially if he knows we're here."</p><p>Which meant another layer of thought – not only was it complex strategically, it might also be <em> a trap.</em></p><p>"So," Hawk said, "to sum it up. We have to destroy the ports – without revealing ourselves or implicating Konoha. <em> Or</em> implicating Hidden Cloud because that is, in effect, also implicating Konoha now."</p><p>"We could get to Kaikou Port ahead of them," Komachi suggested, though somewhat reluctantly. "Blow it before they get there."</p><p>I calculated the odds. The cloud ninja had arrived late, so they'd <em> probably</em> be spending the night in the city. If we left now, travelled overland instead of up the river…</p><p>We'd have no time for scouting or planning. It would be <em> extremely</em> rushed. If there were any complications…</p><p>It didn't look good.</p><p>"Hm," I said, and unfolded the map, carefully spreading it out on the ground.</p><p>Hawk crouched down next to me. "Got an idea?" He asked.</p><p>"Maybe," I said, tracing my finger over the blue ink of the river. An idea was forming, anyway. "Our orders were '<em> disrupt the shipping trade</em> ' not necessarily '<em> destroy the ports'</em> … and we have to do that without it seeming like it was done by ninja…"</p><p>It was a crazy idea.</p><p>So crazy it might work.</p><p>"My idea is," I said, slowly. "We steal the river."</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>ANBU Arc: Chapter 144</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Many thanks to Math-Is-Magic, Frolic (Wafflelate) and Pepperdoken for their help with this chapter.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 144</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. ~ Henry David Thoreau</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"I'm going to need you to expand on that," Hawk-taicho said, voice perfectly dry and droll and with just a faint touch of exasperation.</p><p>I nodded. "'Divert' is probably better terminology," I admitted. "I just wanted to say 'steal the river'."</p><p>"Did you previously specialize in acquisition?" Towa asked, though it was quiet enough to probably be a rhetorical question.</p><p>"I think they prefer to call it 'retrieval'," Komachi muttered to him.</p><p>"Anything big enough to divert the river will be immediately identifiable as enemy action," Hawk pointed out, ignoring them. "Which is the opposite of our mission."</p><p>"Not if it's <em> too big</em> to be ninja."</p><p>Hadn't that been what Kankurou had said? <em> It'd be suspicious if I thought there was any possible way you could have done it.</em></p><p>He'd been right. There had been no way we could have faked out a bijuu formation. But if we were very careful, I thought we could fake this.</p><p>"Land of Earth has a high number of fault lines running through the country," I began carefully. "Including here. Which means earthquakes are common—"</p><p>"We can't fake an earthquake," Hawk-taicho said flatly.</p><p>I hummed, and dragged the mission allocated demolition charges out of my backpack. "I think we can."</p><p>Well, it'd probably take <em> a little more</em> than just demolition charges.</p><p>"The river passes between the twin peaks here," I said, gesturing on the map to the blue line going west-east and the peaks in question. "We plant charges on one side and cause a landslide into the river, blocking it off."</p><p>"Hidden Rock will be able to move a landslide and reopen the river," Komachi says, almost instantly. "Maybe not quickly, but they'll do it."</p><p>I nodded. "That's why we have a simultaneous second operation to the south, using earth jutsu to open up a new path for the river. Water flows downhill, basically. It finds the easiest path and sticks with it. If ours <em> stays</em> easier than the original path..." I let it trail off. "There's a valley here that runs north to south, between these two mountain ranges. If we open the ends and lower the ground height a bit to turn it into a new river…"</p><p>Hawk-taicho traced a finger down the valley, over the markings that indicated its general emptiness and inaccessibility to anyone who wasn't a ninja. "If it goes south then it merges into Sumida-kawa heading to Land of Rivers."</p><p>"Where it branches into… everything, nearly," I agreed. "It'll flood, but there are flood plains here and here which'll get the brunt of it. And the valley will probably turn into more of a lake, which should help."</p><p>"It's crazy," Hawk-taicho said, but thoughtfully.</p><p>We'd done crazier. But generally with less time to think about it. Well, attacking the castle in Land of Snow was probably somewhere on the same level of crazy, and Kakashi-sensei probably <em> had</em> thought about it, but mostly I just remembered doing what he told me. I certainly hadn't been planning anything.</p><p>"I want to scout the area first," Hawk said abruptly, seeming to come to a decision. "There might be complications we don't know about yet."</p><p>"Yes, taicho," we chorused, packed up our gear, and moved out.</p><p><hr /></p><p>There weren't any further complications. We traveled to the west of Kaikou Port — to the west of Hidden Rock and therefore hopefully further west than the Cloud delegation would be travelling. The cliff faces along the river were as steep as the map had said, though more intimidating in person. There was nothing we discovered during scouting that would prevent us from carrying out our plan.</p><p>"All we need to do is cause a slip on the left peak," I said, as we huddled in crevices hopefully out of sight. "Two charges, buried deep at a third and two thirds to collapse the peak… a third charge where the north end of the valley will intersect with the river, — where we want the overflow to happen. We plant the rest of the charges in the valley to create blast-induced liquification in the ground, and taicho and I use earth jutsu on the south end to shape the exit and lower the valley floor a bit and to simulate the earthquake."</p><p>"That'll take a lot of earth jutsu," Towa pointed out. "<em> Especially</em> if you're trying to do it quickly."</p><p>"I can't wait to hear your solution for this," Hawk-taicho said dryly and probably would have folded his arms if we weren't being still and sneaky.</p><p>"Have you ever done Earth Flow?" I asked.</p><p>"No," Hawk said. There was a pause. Then he added, "But I know the theory."</p><p>I knew he knew the theory because he'd have learnt about it the same place that I did: from Kakashi-sensei's book of jutsu, that he'd been busy putting together before we'd fixed his sharingan issue. It had been mysteriously bequeathed to us — read, turned up in Sasuke's house one day — and had existed largely as a source of frustration for us, because it turned out that learning jutsu from written instructions was massively more complicated than learning jutsu from a physical demonstration. And they were all A- or B-rank jutsu, which generally wasn't where anyone sensible started.</p><p>I didn't necessarily think Sasuke had had much more luck since the last time we'd gone over it but 'Earth Flow' wasn't a jutsu in and of itself — it was… a skill. A way to amplify an existing jutsu, by using the natural environment to enhance it to your advantage. Modifying Earth Release; Earth Split into Earth Release; Earth Flow Divide took it from being measured in meters to being measured in <em> kilometers.</em></p><p>Like seals, it relied on the natural energy of the environment — more directly, it relied on dragon veins or natural chakra channels to conduct and carry your jutsu further than it would go on it's own. On the downside, you couldn't change the course of a dragon vein, so unless there was one <em> exactly</em> where you wanted it to be…</p><p>And when there wasn't… well, that was what seals were for.</p><p>"Hmm," Hawk-taicho said, looking critically over the valley below us. "And if we leave any evidence of it being a jutsu, it'll be hidden underneath the water."</p><p>"By the time they — <em> If</em> they — manage to investigate it, there'll be no way to tell," I said. "If there are seismometers nearby, they might detect that the quake is shallow but… that happens. Most earthquakes are less than seventy kilometers from the surface. Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage, anyway, because it takes longer for the energy to disperse, meaning the shaking is prolonged and there's more effect on infrastructure and surface soil."</p><p>"Right," Hawk said, unimpressed with my earthquake facts. "Okay. Towa, Komachi, you'll plant the demolition charges and keep lookout along the river. Bat and I will head south and assume position. We'll initiate proceedings just after dawn — we don't want anyone seeing flashes of light from the charges or jutsu."</p><p>"What will the signal be?" Komachi asked.</p><p>"Things will start shaking," Hawk said dryly. "If you can't feel it, it won't be convincing for the mountain to collapse. In that case, we'll regroup after an hour and reconsider our options."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I traced out the path of the dragon vein for Hawk — it wasn't <em> huge</em> but it was strong enough to fit our purpose and ran most of the way through the valley; most of where we wanted it to. It was quite deep and I wondered if there was a mineral vein or fault line that caused it, something that gathered the chakra, or transmitted chakra easier than the ground around it, but now wasn't exactly the time to investigate.</p><p>Hawk couldn't exactly feel it, not the way I could, but he could memorise what I pointed out and he had the sharingan anyway. That was all about seeing chakra and stuff. He'd be fine.</p><p>I spent the rest of the night sketching out seals to do my part of the job. There was the actual earthquake part — which had to be <em> massive</em> — and creating a smooth join to the Sumida-kawa, without causing <em> that</em> river to flow back into this one.</p><p>When dawn came, we ate cold trail rations and watched the sun rise, then put the plan into action.</p><p>"Okay," Hawk-taicho said. "The signal first. Start the… what are you calling this seal?"</p><p>"Jackhammer?" I suggested, because I hadn't actually given it a name. That wasn't an important part of the creative process. "Oh. Oh. <em> EarthFake</em> . Because. It's a fake earthquake."</p><p>Hawk-taicho rotated his head so his mask was fully staring at me.</p><p>I giggled.</p><p>"Whatever. Just do it."</p><p>I did, rolling my scroll out on the ground and planting my palm in the middle of the ink seal. I activated it and the ink curled up, sinking deep into the ground. There was a brief pause, a moment of tension, and the ground started to rock. Violently. I'd designed the waves to be purposefully erratic, because evenly distributed waves were bound to be suspicious, but that did make it … unnerving.</p><p>We'd chosen a flat portion of ground to start with, so it wasn't like there was anything around to fall on us (unless the whole mountain range went and that wasn't an issue I wanted to start with), and we <em> could</em> stick to the ground with chakra, but still.</p><p>"Your turn," I said.</p><p>Hawk's first attempt at Earth Flow Divide didn't succeed, leaving only a regular sized split in the ground, a few feet long and deep. His second attempt was more successful — it felt to me like his jutsu caught and spread, like a spark catching in dry grass, or when you were doing a collaboration jutsu and handed it off to someone else to complete, only there was no one there — and he made a startled sound and broke it off almost immediately.</p><p>"It's fine," he said brusquely. "I just didn't expect it to... run away like that. I've got it now, you need to do your part."</p><p>I gave a jaunty salute, straightening just in time to see the mountain peak by the river shear in half, like it had been sliced with a sword from heaven, the rock face sliding against itself and crumbling out of sight.</p><p>I gave a low whistle. "Guess the team got the signal," I said, because, yep, that had been the plan and it <em> still</em> looked intense.</p><p>But that also meant a lot of water was going to be headed our way very quickly and I needed to get a move on.</p><p>I dropped another scroll onto the still bucking ground, thrusting chakra into it and a rippling wave to the south made the ground flatten and drop away as the instructions coded in the seal took over. Behind me, Hawk pulsed chakra into the dragon vein and a massive gash opened up in the ground, the sides nearly reaching the edge of the valley itself, that cracked through the rock like it was glass.</p><p><em> Well, that'd do it.</em></p><p>I raced through handseals and smoothed the ground underneath us as much as I could with an earth jutsu, so it looked less like someone had stood here and caused the changes, but wasn't too concerned about finer details. Rough was okay — the was supposed to be natural and would end up at the bottom of a river, anyway.</p><p>"Okay, cut the jutsu and let's go," Hawk said.</p><p>I nodded and scooped my used scrolls up from the ground, cutting all chakra to them. "Done."</p><p>"Isn't it supposed to stop?" He asked, warily, as the ground continued to try throw us off.</p><p>"Aftershocks," I said glibly. "The energy has to bleed off. It can't just <em> stop.</em> "</p><p>We made our way up the side of the valley cliffs to a high vantage point where we could see the scale of the changes happening. The water was definitely being diverted from the river, swirling and creeping up over the collapsed bank and onto the lowered ground. It was muddy and agitated, sinking into the ground and stirring up mud in ways that didn't happen in existing streambeds.</p><p>It would probably take a while for the ecology of the river to adapt, but like they said — life would find a way.</p><p>We'd given it a lot of space to creep into; it'd take quite some time for the water flow to fill it up and we probably shouldn't stick around long enough to see if happen. Hidden Rock would undoubtedly send people out to see what had happened, given that it had impacted on a major shipping route.</p><p>Komachi and Towa were already at the meeting point, waiting for us.</p><p>"All clear, taicho," Komachi said professionally. "We even checked the newly exposed cliff face for any blast markings from the explosives. There's nothing that should be suspicious."</p><p>"Excellent," Hawk said. "The valley change went smoothly. Should be pretty irreversible."</p><p>Even if they did manage to reverse it, it'd take a lot of time and effort, which was pretty much the goal.</p><p>We gave one last long look at the new landscape, and headed south to exfiltrate the country.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Back in Konoha we did the sneaky ANBU thing until Tsunade was ready to see us. Given that there'd been no mission scroll at the start it seemed likely we weren't expected to present any at the end.</p><p>"Mission complete," Hawk-taicho reported.</p><p>Tsunade raised an eyebrow. "Without complications?" she asked.</p><p>There was a long silence. "There were complications," Hawk-taicho said, reluctantly. "However, parameters were within the initial mission briefing."</p><p>Given that the initial briefing had given us a lot of allowance to act, he wasn't wrong. Beside me, Towa and Komachi were still and intent, obviously waiting for Tsunade's reaction.</p><p>"Alright," Tsunade said, professional enough to not sigh. "Let's hear it."</p><p>"Red Team entered Land of Earth via Land of Waterfall," Hawk started, laying out the shape of our mission, briefly, covering the boring and undetected trip to our destination. "However, our arrival at Kawaguchi coincided with the arrival of a team from Hidden Cloud. Four ninja, lead by Killer B."</p><p>Tsunade pursed her lips. "What was their reception like?"</p><p>"Friendly," Hawk-taicho said, after a beat. "Hidden Rock had at least two Jounin meeting them when they arrived, and security in the area was high, but there was no overt hostility."</p><p>That didn't make her happy, which was fair because it wasn't exactly <em> good</em> news. "Any other impressions?"</p><p>"We didn't get close enough to observe them," Hawk denied. "We withdrew without being identified, but judged it too risky to continue with the mission as intended, if the Cloud-nin were going to be travelling through the ports."</p><p>"And now you're going to tell me the wonderfully creative solution you had to that problem," Tsunade said dryly, leaning back in her chair. "Continue."</p><p>Hawk-taicho paused. "We... diverted the river," he said honestly. "Careful application of demolition charges allowed us to mimic natural causes to alter the landscape sufficiently to cause the Furukawa to flow south into the Sumida-kawa instead."</p><p>Tsunade blinked. "So. Instead of destroying the ports, you… caused an earthquake and moved a river."</p><p>"In essence… yes," Hawk agreed.</p><p>She smiled, wryly. "It sounds like Red Team is employing their saboteur to the fullest possible effect," she said. "This is not the outcome I <em> expected</em> , however… it is within the parameters I gave you. Congratulations on a successfully completed mission. We will continue to monitor the situation in Land of Earth and see what results from this."</p><p>That was pretty calm, even for one of <em> our</em> mission reports. But then Tsunade did know who she had sent on a mission and had given us explicitly vague instructions so… it probably wasn't <em> unexpected</em> either. She'd known <em> something</em> would happen, just not what it would be.</p><p>She dismissed us, and we returned to ANBU headquarters to clean up and do whatever gear restocking we needed.</p><p>Or that was the intention. We were just clearing the ANBU HQ entranceway — and its assorted secrecy barriers — when I caught a chakra signal that I hadn't expected. On account of being pretty sure that Kakashi-sensei wasn't in the village.</p><p>"Bat?" Hawk asked, voice quiet, like he was speaking low in case someone was listening.</p><p>"No danger," I said, smiling beneath my mask. "But you should definitely follow me, taicho."</p><p>I lead Hawk in through the winding pathways of the mountain. Komachi and Towa followed us, even though they were technically dismissed. I wasn't sure if it was because they were being nosy or being worried, but it wasn't like I could give a reason for them to leave and our destination seemed to be… a canteen?</p><p>There was a hushed kind of air, like a lot of sneaky ninja surreptitiously listening in on a conversation while trying not to seem like they were listening in.</p><p>And near the center of the room, an ANBU wearing a dog based mask — Kakashi-sensei, without any doubt — was sitting at a table, slouched and reading. Not Icha Icha, which would have been a dead give away, but a bland featureless scroll. Still a sight that was so familiar to us both.</p><p>A second ANBU with a feline mask and chakra tightly suppressed with only the barest hint of rough bark notable to my chakra sense — Tenzou — was standing over him, body language all but shouting irritation and exasperation. "Wolf-senpai," he said, clearly, <em> clearly</em> through gritted teeth. "You can't be here right now."</p><p>There was clearly a zone of 'do not enter' around them and I hesitated for about half a second before bouncing over anyway, Hawk trailing after me. Komachi and Towa faded into the crowd to watch, or decided we weren't about to get murdered and left.</p><p>"Senpai!" I said, because that was what Tenzou (or… whatever his callsign was. <em> Was</em> that his callsign?) had said and was less identifiable than calling him 'sensei'. "You're back!"</p><p>Kakashi-sensei stood and tucked his scroll away. Up close, his mask looked… old. The paint was slightly faded, the white gone slightly yellow, and there were chips and wear marks along the edges. ANBU masks were <em> solid</em> ; how long did it take for that to happen?</p><p>Well, maybe this wasn't his only and original mask, but if it was then the answer was probably something like 'longer than I'd been alive'.</p><p>"Just for a bit," he said and reached out and rapped his knuckles against the forehead of my mask. I scrunched my nose up, underneath it, but apparently this was the new annoying sensei affection now that he couldn't ruffle hair. "And no one willing to greet me when I got here."</p><p>He started walking towards the door with a purposeful stride, and Hawk and I fell into step with him. The halls were, or seemed to be, empty, especially in the direction we were going.</p><p>Tenzou herded after us, as if trying to usher Kakashi-sensei out of HQ. "Because," he said, pointedly, "you <em> aren't supposed to be here</em> ."</p><p>We made our way towards an exit, though it was an exit upwards to the ANBU training grounds on top of the mountain and not 'away' like Tenzou probably wanted us to go.</p><p>"So," Kakashi-sensei asked, lightly in a way that meant he was actually probably serious, "how was your very first ANBU mission?" Though this was honestly a lot of effort to go to for such an innocuous question – something that could have been asked obliquely at basically any time.</p><p>And it was pretty likely that with Kakashi doing this, Tenzou knew who we were beneath the masks — since he absolutely knew who Kakashi was — despite that being entirely counter to Tsunade's intentions. So it was entirely too late to worry about giving away details like 'first mission'.</p><p>"It was pretty fun," I said, cheerfully. "But my taicho is a stickler for the rules."</p><p>Sasuke tripped me, lightning quick, and I staggered to regain my balance, trying not to giggle. It was hard to remember to be professional scary black-ops when it was <em> us.</em></p><p>"I'll send you on a mission with Ocelot-taicho and then see if you complain," Hawk-taicho mock threatened. "She wouldn't let you get away with things like <em> that</em> ."</p><p>I wasn't sure if he was referring to teasing him or to our whole entire mission, but it didn't really matter.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei seemed slightly more bemused by our interactions than normal which – it had been a while, hadn't it? Or maybe I was still slightly riding the high from a successfully completed mission and was being a little sillier than necessary. Whatever, silly was okay, there wasn't anything <em> bad</em> happening right this second that needed me to be serious.</p><p>We stepped outside and headed for an empty training field.</p><p>"See, Cat?" Kakashi-sensei said. "Hawk is a stickler for rules. He can ensure I don't get into trouble."</p><p>Tenzou — Cat, apparently — did not appear impressed by this. "I don't know how you got in," he said, clearly anticipating the answer being something along the lines of 'because he's Kakashi', "but you don't belong here anymore. I <em> will</em> go to Commander Zou. Or the Hokage."</p><p>He sounded serious and final, more than the exasperated badgering of before.</p><p>Given that the last time I'd seen the 'I'll go to the Hokage' bluff used, it had been called, and since I mostly expected Tsunade's response to be along the lines of '<em> dammit</em> , <em> Hatake, does classified mean nothing to you?</em> ' I wasn't entirely surprised that Kakashi was completely unfazed by that threat.</p><p>"Mah, you should relax a little, Cat," Kakashi drawled annoyingly. "It's bad for your stress levels to be so wound up."</p><p>"I'm sorry," Tenzou said, voice deadly quiet, almost vicious and definitely not actually apologising, "if I prefer you <em> alive.</em> "</p><p>Kakashi-sensei faltered. I was sure an actual attack wouldn't have caught him by surprise as much as that had.</p><p>It had taken me a little by surprise too, because I wasn't entirely sure where it had come from. It didn't <em> sound</em> like a direct response to the previous statements…</p><p>I glanced at Hawk, who definitely didn't know either, and we both faded backwards to give them some space and, if not privacy, then at least the polite fiction of it. Kakashi had probably taken us to the training field for a reason so it wasn't like we could just <em> leave,</em> but we could give them some space to talk.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei shifted like he wanted to fold his arms, but didn't, so instead of looking defensive looked weirdly open and vulnerable. "Well. Here I am. Alive."</p><p>"Here you are," Tenzou echoed. "Alive." He didn't sound happy. "And still doing your best to change that."</p><p>"No?" Kakashi-sensei said, sounding a little unsure. "Hokage-sama has an assignment that keeps me pretty busy."</p><p>"I heard," Tenzou said, bitterly. "I guess I should have known you'd find another way, regardless."</p><p><em> Yikes</em> . I was pretty sure I knew what was going down here now. I still didn't want to get involved, but I hadn't wanted to get involved when Tsunade had knocked on Kakashi-sensei's door and tried to drag me into it, either. Hadn't she basically said that he'd been put on Jounin-sensei duty as light work? And been given the War Operations in-village posting when that hadn't been enough?</p><p>And now he was back in the field again.</p><p>If you didn't know that he was better, that might have seemed like backtracking.</p><p>"I'm not— I am actually just here to make sure the kids are okay. That they're not… doing what I was. With ANBU."</p><p>Well. I glanced at Hawk again because that was actually about us and explained why Kakashi-sensei had shown up in the first place. I had basically assumed it was generic Kakashi protectiveness and, yeah, okay, that was under the umbrella.</p><p>"They aren't," he added, like it needed qualifying. "They seem happy."</p><p>"We had moments like that," Tenzou pointed out. He swallowed. "Didn't we?"</p><p>"We did," Kakashi-sensei said, slowly, like he was still trying to catch up to the turns the conversation was taking Like he was realising that maybe they had been friends, even when he'd been in his worst place. "Yeah.. Sometimes."</p><p>It didn't seem like the correct response.</p><p>Tenzou's body language closed down. I hadn't been aware of how open he was getting, until all those walls came crashing back down. "You'll <em> die</em> ," he said, despair upon resignation, with the clear understanding this wasn't an argument Kakashi would even care about. "If you keep this up."</p><p>Not <em> kept.</em> Not past tense.</p><p><em> Kakashi-sensei, no.</em></p><p>Kakashi gave a full body flinch. "Wait. Tenzou." He seemed to fumble for words. "It's– The thing that you noticed," he said, which was probably half because this was not a secure location and half because he didn't want to actually say it. "It was healed. So you shouldn't… worry."</p><p>"What?" Tenzou said.</p><p>Kakashi hunched his shoulders. "You didn't think the Hokage would send me out if I wasn't cured, did you?"</p><p>There was a long silence where the answer 'yes' might have landed. "Just like that?" Tenzou asked, instead. "No more problem, everything is fine now?"</p><p>"You say that like it was easy," Kakashi responded, trying to evade back into banter. He waved a lax hand in my general direction. "Ask them, if you don't believe me."</p><p>The feline mask turned in my direction, so I stepped forward. "Operation; Miracle," I said, choosing my words carefully. "Was a medical enterprise spearheaded by Tsunade-sama that returned the shinobi in question to full field readiness."</p><p>I nodded. That was all true. Definitely <em> implied</em> things. But was true.</p><p>"Were you ever going to mention this?" Tenzou asked, staring at Kakashi-sensei blankly. Some kind of tension unwound, only to be replaced by puzzled hurt. "I would have liked to know."</p><p>I sank back again.</p><p>"I didn't <em> mention it</em> in the first place," Kakashi-sensei pointed out, stiffly. "You worked it out. You'd have worked it out again."</p><p>"Right," Tenzou said, shoulders slumping. "Of course I would have." And there was the resignation.</p><p>"Sensei," I said quietly, "that was cruel."</p><p>I loved him and I could cope with his weird social issues but there was 'not talking' and then there was 'leaving a friend to wonder when you would die'. I didn't really know Tenzou, not more than that he was Kakashi's friend and that one meeting we'd had in the tower, but it was enough to make me want to step in and fix this.</p><p>"Stand down, Bat," Tenzou said, tiredly. "You don't need to fight with Wolf-senpai on my behalf. Once you burn that bridge there's no going back. I guess I shouldn't be so surprised I wasn't told."</p><p>"I meant," Kakashi-sensei said, falteringly, because he knew it had been cruel and it was a little too late to actually do anything about it but try to explain whatever thought process he had had. "I thought you were keeping tabs. I thought you <em> knew.</em> Because you knew before."</p><p>"How would I have known?" Tenzou asked, throwing his hands up. "Your many and varied hospital visits? The way you tried to pass your students off to me?"</p><p>"Ah… in my defence that was before it was fixed," Kakashi offered, like he knew it was a pretty shallow defence and in fact possibly made things worse. He scratched the side of his mask with a fingertip, which was even more pointless with the ANBU mask than normal. "I should have told you. I'm still…" he paused unsure but continued anyway, "not really happy you made me leave, even though everything worked out better. For the best. But I didn't leave you in the dark because of it."</p><p>"I knew it wouldn't make you happy with me," Tenzou pointed out, "I did it to keep you <em> alive.</em> It was a trade off I was willing to make. Would be willing to make again." He crossed his arms.</p><p>Kakashi nodded. "Well. I'm not back. And also not dying. So there shouldn't be any need for that?"</p><p>"Hopefully not," Tenzou said, "because I don't have any more bridges to burn."</p><p>Okay, I had been told to keep out of it, but that was just too sad. I reached out — motion clearly telegraphed to not startle him — and patted him on the shoulder.</p><p>He was the mokuton guy, clearly he had, in fact, infinite bridges. That was probably not a good thing to say right now, given that I was attempting to be the tonally aware one in this conversation.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei cleared his throat. "I don't actually know where you're trying to go with this metaphor," he admitted. "But you said it twice so it probably means something."</p><p>"It means you're <em> friends</em> ," I said, only a touch impatiently. "And now you need to, like, say that and then hug and make up, or beat each other up on the training field. Whichever."</p><p>"We're friends," Kakashi-sensei protested, like I'd insulted him.</p><p>"Wolf-senpai," Tenzou said, voice slightly thick. "That's how you treat your friends?"</p><p>"There's a reason I don't have many," Kakashi said back, somewhat warily. "You and Gai. So… yes?" He gestured over his shoulder with his thumb, towards the open field. "We could spar?" He asked hopefully.</p><p>I almost expected there to be more conversation, but Tenzou took him up on it, which meant I could slink off towards Sasuke. I hoped that had resolved it, but I still lacked enough of the background to do more than guess wildly at the issues involved.</p><p>"I could be at home right now," Sasuke said, sighing. His arms were crossed and he was leaning back against a tree. "I could be <em> asleep</em> ."</p><p>I nodded, standing shoulder to shoulder to watch two elite ANBU kick each other around. My heart hurt. '<em> I did it to keep you alive, even though you'll hate me for it</em> .' Didn't that dig in too close to home?</p><p>"We can probably leave," I suggested. "I'd say this is more important than whatever Kakashi-sensei was going to say to us."</p><p>Or he'd come and find us later. Either way, we left them to it.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Police Arc: Chapter 145</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Super thanks to Frolic, Pepperdoken and MathIsMagic for their help and brainstorming!</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 145</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> But friendship is precious, not only in the shade, but in the sunshine of life; and thanks to a benevolent arrangement of things, the greater part of life is sunshine. ~ Thomas Jefferson</em></p><p><em> .</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>When Sasuke and I rocked up to our training field the next morning, it was already in use.</p><p>Sasuke huffed and crossed his arms, even though, technically, we had no more rights to it than anyone else because we hadn't, like, booked it or anything.</p><p>I shook my head. "It's Kakashi-sensei and Tenzou," I said, and for a brief second, I wondered if they'd been fighting since we'd left them last night. But no – they'd moved training fields so that probably implied a break in there somewhere. "They're probably waiting for us."</p><p>"Who is Tenzou?" Sasuke asked, frowning, but following me into the training field. We headed towards the memorial stone to wait.</p><p>I blinked. That… probably wasn't something I should actually <em> say</em> out loud, even if I was sure there was no one around to hear it. "You know," I said vaguely, and brought my wrist up to chin level, hand loosely curled like a maneki-neko. "Nyah."</p><p>Sasuke looked at me blankly.</p><p>He was still looking at me blankly when Kakashi-sensei and Tenzou stopped fighting and dropped down onto the grass to say good morning.</p><p>"I hate you," Sasuke said to me. "There was <em> literally</em> no other way you could have conveyed that information?"</p><p>I smirked and shrugged.</p><p>"Now, now, don't say such hurtful things," Kakashi-sensei chided. "You don't want to misunderstand each other."</p><p>We <em> both</em> gave him a flat look. Though… it was probably a good thing that Kakashi-sensei was advocating clear communication. Progress? Probably.</p><p>Tenzou gave a vaguely disbelieving snort, apparently not that impressed by it. But he was <em> here</em> so that also indicated that <em> some</em> form of reconciliation between them.</p><p>"So what are we doing?" Sasuke asked, obviously assuming Kakashi-sensei had some reason for arranging a team training, however coincidental it seemed.</p><p>Kakashi-sensei just gave a rolling shrug. "You must have been working on <em> something</em> in between classified missions to places unknown," he said, like he wasn't perfectly aware of what we'd been doing.</p><p>I hummed thoughtfully. "I mean, we could definitely use some pointers on Earth Jutsu. That's your speciality right, Tenzou-san? I think sensei mentioned it once…"</p><p>Tenzou rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. "You could say that, I guess."</p><p>Sasuke nodded, catching onto where I was leading. "Do you know Earth Flow?" he asked. "We've been working on that."</p><p>"You taught them Earth Flow?" Tenzou asked Kakashi-sensei, sounding honestly surprised. "I didn't think you were any good at it."</p><p>Kakashi-sensei looked mildly insulted, which probably meant it was true. And it being <em> true</em> was interesting, because there wasn't much in the way of jutsu that Kakashi sensei <em> wasn't good at.</em> "I gave them the information," he deferred. "Didn't know they'd been working on it. How far did you get?"</p><p>"Sasuke can do it," I said.</p><p>"But Shikako had to point out the … lines," he said back. "And it got away from me a bit. Wasn't very controlled."</p><p>Tenzou looked intrigued. "I've never actually managed to teach it to anyone else," he said. "It's very intuitive to me, but Dragon Veins are a complicated concept."</p><p>I shrugged. "Not <em> that</em> complicated," I said. "They're points of concentrated natural energy." Then I actually thought about it. "Wait, can you sense them? Or do you like… divine where they are based on, like, topological details?"</p><p>Tenzou blinked rapidly. "I can sense them," he said, baffled. "How on earth would you go about divining where they might be?"</p><p>"Hah!" I said, gleefully, which totally wasn't an answer to the very good question he had asked. "And Jiraiya said that people couldn't 'just' sense natural energy."</p><p>"Just because you found <em> one other person</em> who can do it-" Kakashi-sensei started.</p><p>"Is this that Sage thing?" Sasuke asked, over top of him, because, yes actually, he had been there for that conversation, hadn't he? "Wait. I thought Jiraiya said not to use it or you would <em> die. Or worse.</em> "</p><p>"Jiraiya? Sage?" Tenzou asked, at the same time, bewildered.</p><p>"That's totally a different-" I said, also managing to talk over top of them. "We aren't <em> using</em> using-"</p><p>We all stopped talking, cutting off into silence.</p><p>I cleared my throat, tentatively, and received 'go ahead' nods. Yeesh. "Natural energy is … kind of like chakra produced by plants and animals and things that just… kind of exists in the world. Sages like Jiraiya or the monks at the Fire Temple can use it as a chakra source and bring it into their body – but it's dangerous and requires a lot of training. Earth Flow uses it to amplify jutsu in kinda the opposite way? You synchronise your jutsu to the Dragon Vein, without actually touching the natural energy yourself." I paused. "Right?"</p><p>"Well, yes. A Dragon Vein is a concentrated path of energy in the earth," Tenzou said. "You can take advantage of it using earth jutsu, like taking advantage of a river for water jutsu."</p><p>Sasuke was frowning, though. "Okay, but I'm not trained in any of that."</p><p>"Ah, but you are kind of naturally attuned to natural energy," I said, a little apologetically. I raised my hand to my collarbone and tapped my thumb over the point where Sasuke's curse seal was on him – even though everyone here probably knew about that too. The curse seal had definitely had a natural energy clause, and the pills and barrel situation had been designed to catalyse a full body change for him. The second stage curse seal was effectively a kind of sage mode. "Or the sharingan is a cheater."</p><p>I'd never doubted Sasuke could do it, but I hadn't actually thought about it in terms of his curse seal, before suggesting Earth Flow as a solution on our mission, but it made sense. The curse seal was basically a hacked sage mode – well, on a very lose interpretation – so clearly he was further along the scale than most people. I could sense stuff, but even with the Fire Temple training, I didn't have much in the way of knowledge on how to actually use it.</p><p>Following that thought, it was more interesting that Tenzou could.</p><p>Then again.</p><p>Mokuton was weird as far as bloodlimits went, and not just for the rarity. It had been explained as a mix of Earth and Water affinities, but that was clearly not the full story – there was also a Mud Release bloodlimit that was made up of the same, and that one made ontological sense.</p><p>Mokuton clearly had a little bit <em> more.</em> Something <em> living</em> . Did it also require an affinity for natural energy, some ability to be a sage?</p><p>Did Tenzou inherit that with the bloodlimit, or had he naturally had the ability and that had allowed him to <em> survive it</em> ?</p><p>Not my place to ask.</p><p>"So please, if you have any advice…" I said, leadingly. "We'd be very grateful."</p><p>Tenzou did have advice – some of which was familiar from my training with Tonbo in the Sensory Squad, but which seemed new to Sasuke. We couldn't actually practice here, because there weren't convenient Dragon Veins running through our training field and even if there had been it was probably a little too destructive to throw around inside Konoha, but Kakashi-sensei suggested scheduling training later at the place he'd taken Sasuke during the Chunin Exams.</p><p>When we wound down, Kakashi-sensei offhandedly suggested we get food, which was sweet coming from him.</p><p>"You guys go without me," I said, shaking my head. "I need to get to the hospital."</p><p>Three pairs of eyes immediately snapped to me and started scanning for injuries, like I was going to spontaneously start bleeding everywhere.</p><p>"For <em> class</em> ," I said, exasperated.</p><p>Studying medicine gave me a good excuse to hang out with Sakura, even though we weren't in any of the same classes. I had a good advantage, what with previously having studied anatomy and biology and knowing the basic jutsu, but Sakura had taken to medical ninjutsu like a duck to water and was deserving of the interest that Tsunade had shown in her for it.</p><p>"How goes training, Sakura-senpai?" I teased. "Finally mastered the strength technique?"</p><p>She went a little pink. "Not mastered," she said, demurely, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "But… I'm getting pretty good. Shishou says I still have a long way to go, though!"</p><p>I was genuinely happy to hear that. "I think Tsunade-sama thinks we <em> all</em> have a long way to go."</p><p><hr /></p><p>Red Team ended up rostered onto in-village patrols for the next few weeks, which was possibly the equivalent of downtime after a strenuous mission.</p><p>Not that it had been terribly strenuous? Just… requiring of inventive problem solving, with the potential for a confrontation with Killer B on the horizon.</p><p>It meant we were still in Konoha for the New Years Festival, though, which was lucky because it would have been <em> extremely</em> difficult for me to totally vanish for that. Too many people would have made a point of looking for me to buy the 'oh I was Somewhere Else And Busy' excuse.</p><p>Like the previous year – god, had it been a year already? – Sasuke came to our house before we all left for the festival.</p><p>"You'll love this," I said, "come on."</p><p>Kino, who had been woken and dressed in a teensy tiny kimono and was thrilled and delighted to be up in the forbidden <em> past bedtime</em> hours, took one look at us, raised his arms, and cried, "Ni! Ni!"</p><p>"That's right, little knight," I said. "Ni, ni to you too."</p><p>Sasuke scooped him up, bouncing him in the air and gained a few more happy 'ni!'s.</p><p>"It's his new favourite word," I explained to Sasuke. "Everything he likes is 'ni' right now. Shikamaru, me, Teddy, food… except for Kaa."</p><p>"Kaa!" Kino repeated eagerly, looking around for mom. He waved at her, frantically and uncoordinated. "Ni!"</p><p>"That's … fair," Sasuke said, voice cracking only slightly.</p><p>Kino didn't really stay awake that long. Even his wide eyed delight at the festival flagged quickly because of the late hour, and Sasuke ended up giving him back to Mum so that he could get some sleep.</p><p>I hadn't really given the festival much thought – if I had I probably would have thought that it wouldn't be as big or as joyful as previous years. Not with half our shinobi deployed to the front and in-village security getting wound tighter and tighter.</p><p>But that wasn't really the case. On the contrary, it seemed even livelier – more stalls, louder music, more people dressed up – like everyone was making a <em> special effort</em> to enjoy it simply <em> because</em> everything else was worse.</p><p>Yeah. I felt that.</p><p>I squared my shoulders and made a concentrated effort to do the same. "Oh," I said, spotting the nearest food stall. "Taiyaki! Let's get some."</p><p>Sasuke smirked. "You're just going to spend the whole night eating sugar, aren't you?"</p><p>I grinned. "That sounds like a <em> great</em> plan, taicho."</p><p>He scoffed like <em> that wasn't a suggestion</em> , but also brought a savoury waffle fish, despite the sweet ones being clearly superior.</p><p>We ran into Kiba fairly early on, who dragged us towards a pack of Inuzuka and dogs with an arm around each of our shoulders. Akamaru gave me soulful puppy eyes until I forfeited the last bites of taiyaki to him.</p><p>"Weak," Kiba said, shaking his head and laughing. "You gotta learn to resist."</p><p>"I'm sure I'm not the only one," I claimed, watching an impromptu performance of dogs being adorable and backflipping over each other to the extreme pleasure of the gathering crowd. "Besides, it means I can buy more now."</p><p>We chatted for a little while, applauded the performances, until Kiba was swept up in it again.</p><p>"Oh, also! If you see Sai tell him to come find me!" He asked, because apparently there'd been a new release of some terrible manga that he wanted to share with him. "I've been looking for him, but can't find him."</p><p>There was a crease of irritation on his forehead, the sting to the professional pride of a tracking specialist who had unknowingly been trying to track an ANBU and failing.</p><p>I tried not to smirk. "Will do!" Though it wasn't like <em> I</em> knew how to get a hold of Sai regularly either. Did he even have an apartment? Did he live somewhere off the grid with ROOT? Would it be a problem for him to just randomly go and see Kiba, or would that be standard under 'maintaining cover'?</p><p>Definitely not questions I wanted to be contemplating while trying to enjoy myself at a festival.</p><p>I had hoped to run into Ino and the rest before the fireworks, but that wasn't the case, so Sasuke and I found ourselves a good view point on one of the rooftops that had been converted into little picnic seating areas for the night. It was a little out of the way, so it wasn't <em> crowded</em> but it was still populated.</p><p>Including by a familiar presence lurking in a back corner.</p><p>"Hi, Ibiki-taicho!" He wasn't even dressed up, still in his ninja uniform and black coat, which somehow looked even more incongruous than on a regular day. But, there was an open bottle of sake and saucer on the table and he looked <em> relaxed</em> so it wasn't like he was working. "Wow, it's a nice view from up here."</p><p>And I wasn't even being facetious. A good view of the fireworks – of course – but also of the central streets where the main part of the festival was, and of the river where the fire dancing and more physical activities and competitions were happening.</p><p>Ibiki looked amused. "It is, yes."</p><p>The fireworks themselves were fun. I'd worried – for a split half second, when the first boom and crack had sounded and the flare of light hadn't yet lit up the sky – that I wouldn't enjoy them. Worse. That they would remind me-</p><p>But of course not. There had been no boom and flash. No gunshot sounds for my mind to worry over. That wasn't what anything had been about.</p><p>Fireworks were just fireworks.</p><p>"How is your Jounin Project going?" Ibiki asked casually. It wasn't exactly a secret what we were working on, in fact, given the number of questions we'd gone around asking about it, it was pretty much the opposite of a secret.</p><p>"Slowly," Sasuke admitted, leaning his elbows on the table.</p><p>Ibiki raised an eyebrow. "I would think that simply reinstating a department that previously existed would be simple."</p><p>That was so bland as to be a challenge. There was absolutely no way that Ibiki thought it would actually be <em> easy.</em></p><p>"Sure," I agreed, amicably. "If you only wanted to reinstate it exactly as is. And even in that case, resurrecting it simply from documentation and without input from shinobi with experience <em> using</em> it is a challenge. But Konoha has adapted to … not having a police force, so there need to be decisions about where it should take back over and where the new system is better – or if a different change needs to be made." I shrugged one shoulder. "You probably have input on that, don't you, Ibiki-taicho? The Intel Division and prison must have had quite a bit of overlap with the Police."</p><p>"A thoughtful point," Ibiki said, casual enough that he had absolutely already thought of that.</p><p>Of course he had. Everyone who was going to be mildly affected by our plans had probably run through exactly what it could mean for them.</p><p>If they would just <em> tell us</em> what they were worried about-</p><p>Could we make submission forms or something? Send out a survey?</p><p>Something to consider.</p><p>I smiled, a touch ruefully. "We would, of course, be grateful for any of your advice. I'm sure your department runs extremely smoothly."</p><p>Ibiki agreed to meet up with us at some point to go over it all, which was exciting. I looked forward to working with Ibiki again, especially on something basically harmless. That probably tipped this police force thing from 'tedious make work assignment' to 'fun collaborative group project'.</p><p>You know, for a given value of 'fun group project'.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Police Arc: Chapter 146</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Super thanks to Frolic, Pepperdoken and MathIsMagic.</p><p>There is now a Heliocentrism community on AO3, and a DOS Prompt Meme (also on AO3) thanks to Frolic!</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 146</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. ― Søren Kierkegaard</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>"Okay," Sasuke said, jaw tensed and shoulders tight. "Bring it down."</p><p>I pressed my hand to the security seal, aligning the key and forcing the defences around the building to collapse.</p><p>Then I hesitated, darting a glance at Sasuke. "Are you sure? We can always-"</p><p>The look he gave me in turn was sardonic. He didn't even answer, just stepped forward and pushed the entrance door open.</p><p>Helplessly, I followed.</p><p>And then we were the first living people to set foot in the Uchiha Police Station in over five years. After the initial flurry of duty reassignment and information grabbing, the buildings had just been… locked up and sealed to prevent looters (or <em> unauthorised</em> information grabbing).</p><p>It had taken a bit of wrangling to get access to the security key but no one could exactly argue that our assignment didn't give us authorisation. It was more just that the key itself had been in the far reaches of the poorly organised archive and only half a dozen people had known that – finding the right person who knew the right things was half the trick of getting anything done in the tower.</p><p>For a building that I had never set foot in before, it was startlingly familiar. For a second, all I could see was that reverse world red-and-black overlying it.</p><p><em> Here</em> was where I had stood, unable to move, as Itachi had entered the room. <em> There</em> was where Tokimi Uchiha had been working at her desk, had looked up, had stood, one hand braced against her desk, had caught a kunai through the neck and gone down, chair tipping over and clattering—</p><p>I looked away. The desks in the bullpen had been pushed against the walls, drawers pulled out and stacked on top, riffled through and emptied of important content. There was a corkboard on the front wall, hastily pinned notices and flyers — 'Social Club Drinks on Friday at 5pm', takeaway menus for local restaurants — the detris of an office building. The windows had been covered with black tarp, the power was off, the air was musty and stale and full of dust.</p><p>"We could probably hire some minions to clean," I said, voice surprisingly steady, if dull. "I mean, genin." My heart wasn't in the joke, but that was okay. Standard, pro-forma.</p><p>Sasuke snorted. "Yeah, they can probably find the rest of the security systems too. With their <em> faces</em> ." He sounded about as steady-and-detached as me.</p><p>I wished we'd brought someone else with us. But Sasuke had wanted to, or maybe needed to, do this alone. Just the two of us.</p><p>Or maybe he just didn't want to have these reactions in front of anyone else. I didn't either.</p><p>"Okay, LED seal?" I asked, slapping one to my forehead and lighting it up like we hadn't already prepared for it to be dark in here. We'd prepared for a lot of eventualities, treated the whole thing like a serious ANBU mission which was completely unconnected to us, as people.</p><p>"I guess we should start down here," I said as I edged forward into the room. Even the chakra muffling of my cat's foot technique didn't really stop the dust from puffing up over my shoe. "Or maybe find a broom."</p><p>Sasuke applied his own headlamp seal and looked critically around the room. "Maybe a wind jutsu?" he said, thoughtfully.</p><p>I looked around critically too. "A really minor one, maybe," I said, because really the only wind jutsu I was familiar with was Temari knocking over trees. Somehow I didn't think that was a good idea in a confined space. "Like… the one for dispersing mist and poison."</p><p>Which technically wasn't really even a wind jutsu, just an agitation of chakra that in turn blew stuff away.</p><p>Sasuke nodded seriously. "Right," he said and flared his chakra, swirling it around him in a circular motion, picking up all the dust and debris on the ground.</p><p>And I realised our critical mistake as everything lifted into the air. Calling it a 'storm' was a bit of an exaggeration, because it wasn't exactly <em> violent</em> but all the dust that had been on the floor was now in the air and moving.</p><p>We dashed for the door, coughing, and fled outside, leaving the door open hopefully. Some of the dust followed us out, swirling and sticking to us and falling out the open door to dance prettily in the mid morning light… But not enough of it.</p><p>I picked ruefully at my dust covered vest. Gross. It was everywhere, even in my <em> eyelashes.</em> "Well," I said and tried to brush some of it off. It only stuck to my hands instead.</p><p>Sasuke looked faintly sheepish. And also very covered in dust. His hair was almost grey. "Right," he agreed. "In hindsight 'it needs to go out the door' is… obvious." He looked at the door. "Maybe a push from the other side of the room?"</p><p>I coughed. "Firstly," I said and waved a hand at us. Though, it wasn't like we could just go home and get changed. Not without resetting the whole security system first, because leaving it open like this was bad security protocol.</p><p>Maybe if—</p><p>I gently gathered some chakra in my hand, letting it seep out onto my skin - just onto my skin and no further. The dust stirred and shifted. Then I used the same agitation technique to disperse it into the air, pulling my chakra quickly away from my skin.</p><p>The dust exploded into the air and I yanked my now clean hand out of the mess. My skin tingled a bit and felt strangely <em> dry</em> but that was acceptable. "That works," I said, satisfied, and proceeded to use it on the rest of myself. Hair and clothes were a little trickier than straight skin, but not so much as to make it unusable.</p><p>"Huh," Sasuke said, watching me. "Kind of like scent blocking, but you use it to get stuff off instead of to keep stuff in?"</p><p>I paused. "Yeah, actually, that's not a bad description. Hey, I wonder if that's how the Hyuuga always get away with wearing white? Insta-clean jutsu?"</p><p>Sasuke smirked. "I wouldn't put it past them," he said. "And I guess we're going to find out in a minute." He motioned at the still open door. Inside, the dust storm had not even remotely settled.</p><p>Maybe a wind jutsu to blow it out the door? But the door was a comparatively small target and air would have to get back <em> into</em> the room to replace what was being blown out, which could cause problems.</p><p>"Maybe if I seal it?" I suggested, somewhat doubtfully. "I could make a seal just smaller than the room size — empty out the middle. It wouldn't get everything but it would make things a little better."</p><p>Sasuke shrugged. "Sure. We already tried my bad idea. You're due one."</p><p>"Thanks a lot," I said wryly. But I made a chakra bubble around my mouth and ducked back into the room to measure out the size. The insta-clean blocking technique did, in fact, seem to work pretty well against dust storms.</p><p>Sealing away a cube of air wasn't something I'd done before but it also wasn't hard to modify a seal to do, either. The sudden vanishing of air caused a bit of a vacuum and for more air to rush in from outside and stir everything up again, but it did get rid of the vast majority of our problem.</p><p>"Right," Sasuke said, also with full chakra protection on, surveying the room critically. "Maybe we should start upstairs. Since we accidentally triggered one of the building defences down here."</p><p>I picked up my scroll and dusted off my hands for show. "That is <em> absolutely</em> what we did," I agreed solemnly.</p><p>And if both of us skipped the second stair, where Koyane Uchiha had bled out… well, that was easy to bury beneath the foolishness of what we'd just done.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Upstairs — where we didn't create any more dust monsters with ill-conceived jutsu usage — was the office of the Chief of Police. Sasuke hesitated at the door, brushing his fingers over the plaque with his fathers name on it, but pushed open the door without a word.</p><p>The office actually had still functioning security traps from back when the police existed. We <em> didn't</em> have security keys for those, because they hadn't been filed with the village, but between my chakra sense and Sasuke's sharingan, we did pretty good at spotting and dismantling them.</p><p>I suspected that much of the security had relied upon, y'know, the presence of <em> people.</em> Even when we did trigger an alarm, there was no one here to hear it and respond.</p><p>It was a disheartening thought, even if it did make our job just that little bit easier.</p><p>By evening, we had mostly cleared the building; there had been at least one filing cabinet that had been supremely resistant to lockpicking and a safe that seemed like it would destroy its contents if we tried to compromise it. We would probably have to call in a professional if we wanted to know what was inside them, because my offered solution of 'cut them open with the lightsaber' was considered and rejected. We hadn't had time to really <em> look</em> at anything we were picking up, but we were searching by LED light and there was no reason that we had to do in depth analysis <em> in</em> the Police Station.</p><p>So we didn't; just sealed everything away in stacks of relevance and took them back to my house to work on. After dinner we took over the living room floor and spread them out, and started idly paging through it all.</p><p>Shikamaru was out on a mission — something easy with Ino and Chouji, which he'd seemed pretty eager to go on — but Dad had finally returned from the border, to my delight. He and Mum spoke quietly (and Kino had paroxysms of joy every time he caught sight of him) but Dad seemed more exhausted than I'd ever seen him, and I … very much didn't ask anything about how it was out there.</p><p>He retired early with an admonishment to Sasuke and I to get some sleep that we agreed to and then proceeded to ignore. It wasn't like this was particularly urgent stuff, and it certainly didn't need us to pull an all nighter to go over it right this instant. It had waited five years, and we were still four months off of our <em> absolute minimum</em> deadline — and yet, when ten o'clock rolled around I put the kettle on for another pot of tea without even asking.</p><p>Sasuke gave no indication of leaving, or of intending to go to sleep.</p><p>It was going to be a long night, either way, and probably one better spent awake.</p><p>"There's a bunch of unsolved cases," Sasuke said, licking his thumb and flicking through a whole stack of files. "They look like they just got… forgotten about. Do you think we should… look into those?" he asked, uncertainly.</p><p>I blinked. "Um. We could, I guess," I said, even though I had no idea how we would actually go about investigating cold cases like that. "Couldn't hurt."</p><p>But the thought of all those case files sitting there just gathering dust because the officers who had been working on them, who had maybe <em> known</em> the answer to their riddles, had died and taken all that knowledge with them made something in my ribcage twist and ache.</p><p>So much lost. So many things left unfinished.</p><p>I cleared my throat, then realised I didn't actually have anything to say when Sasuke looked up and raised an eyebrow questioningly. "Just… thinking," I said, lamely, ducking my head back down and pulling another sheath of paper closer. I had a notepad and drummed my pen against it like I was intending to make notes.</p><p>Eventually the bureaucratic minutia, divorced of tragedy and reduced to black ink on white paper, made the night hours creep by. Before dawn, just before anyone upstairs started to stir, I yawned and stretched, moving to the kitchen to start making breakfast.</p><p>Sasuke blinked, like coming out of a daze or a dream, his own mechanically steady notetaking grinding to a halt. "Need a hand?" he rasped.</p><p>"Sure," I said, with a shrug, dumping rice into the rice cooker. "We'll go feed the deer in a second."</p><p>Morning chores were quick and easy with two people doing them, and the cold crisp air outside was refreshing after an all nighter staring at paperwork. We stopped in the backyard and did a quick morning warm up, though the lights inside started coming on before we turned it into sparring.</p><p>"Morning, kids," Mum said, Kino held against her shoulder. "Are you still working in the living room?"</p><p>She had to have seen the paper all spread out, so that was probably more of a hint than a real question.</p><p>"Uh, yeah," I said, ducking into the kitchen to flick the kettle on. I got Mum's tea leaves down and the jar of strong coffee that Dad preferred on hard mornings. I suspected he would want it.</p><p>"Our Mother-Baby Group is coming round this morning," Mum said, which probably explained why she wanted it all cleaned up and tidy. "Though if it's going to be a nice day we might take the meeting outside."</p><p>"We'll clean it up," Sasuke promised. "We're close to done, anyway."</p><p>For a given value of 'done' meaning 'I've had enough' rather than 'this task is accomplished', anyway. I wanted to yawn just thinking of continuing, so it was definitely time to take a break on it. Which meant it was no real hardship to seal it all away and have the place tidy again.</p><p>Dad had to go to the Tower, because the work of the Jounin Commander waited for nobody, not even those who had just returned from the front. Sasuke left to go home and change (he really should just have started keeping stuff here, or in a storage scroll like I did, honestly) and I walked to the tower with Dad because I could. We stopped and got nikuman buns from Hironobu's bakery on the way.</p><p>"Don't tell your mother," Dad said, winking, just like he had every time we'd done this when I was a kid.</p><p>I grinned back. "She'd tell us to eat more breakfast."</p><p>I swung by Intel while I was there to pick up anything for me — nothing interesting — and then headed to the Team 7 training grounds to do a proper morning workout.</p><p>Sasuke was already there.</p><p>"What took you so long?" he asked.</p><p>"I didn't realise I had an appointment," I said dryly, because we hadn't said anything about meeting here. Probably because it had been obvious.</p><p>Sasuke scoffed, not even deigning to answer that.</p><p><hr /></p><p>After training (and cleaning up after training) we went home again because we'd done good work on the police stuff and were motivated to keep going. It was a good idea until the threatened Mother-Baby Group arrived. I hadn't realised how much of a big deal it was going to be until a dozen women started arriving in dribs and drabs — laden with babies and strollers and carry bags.</p><p>The two of us retreated to the porch where the shogi table was.</p><p>"So I think we're going to have one major problem," I said thoughtfully, tapping the notes I'd made.</p><p>Sasuke nodded. "Manpower," he agreed.</p><p>I paused. "I was going to say 'money'," I said. "But I see your point. Two major problems then."</p><p>"What's the money problem?" Sasuke asked.</p><p>"I was suspicious when I couldn't find much in the way of budget filed with the Tower," I said. "And the files from the station only confirmed it. The Police were an Uchiha Clan subsidiary, the same way Nara RnD is part of the Nara Clan. Which means that largely? They were funded by the Uchiha Clan." I tapped the paper again. "I mean, there was some income in the form of fines and other fees but not <em> enough</em> and, frankly, funding a police force through fines isn't really a very good solution. You end up having to make a certain quota of fines in order to keep the police running which … crime doesn't exactly happen on a schedule. And therefore you might end up handing out fines for things that don't, strictly speaking, meet the criteria."</p><p>Konoha really didn't need to add 'police abuse of power' to its list of concerns.</p><p>"Ah," Sasuke said, in understanding. "So… we need the village to fund it."</p><p>"Yup," I said, popping the 'p'. "Which they're probably not going to like very much, but to be honest, at this point claiming it's a clan subsidiary is silly. It shouldn't have been in the first place, really. You can't claim that it <em> only</em> served the Uchiha Clan — RnD is different because we sell everything we make, so it does only serve the Nara Clan, even though the things it makes end up all over the village. Same with the Aburame or the Akimichi or the Inuzuka."</p><p>Sasuke nodded. "That's kind of the point with manpower too," he said. "All the police were Uchiha."</p><p><em> And now there are no Uchiha,</em> I finished silently.</p><p>We sat in silence for a bit, as Mum hustled the other women and kids outside with picnic blankets to sit on the grass. "Can you grab the food from inside, dear?" she asked, sounding faintly harried, as she stepped past us.</p><p>I guessed she'd decided to have the meeting outside afterall. It was probably a good idea given how… noisy inside was getting.</p><p>"Sure," Sasuke said, rising to help. I twisted our notes into hammerspace because it wasn't <em> exactly</em> classified, but it wasn't <em> not</em> either, and I didn't feel comfortable leaving them lying around when there were so many people here.</p><p>I vaguely knew some of the women Mum was meeting with — they'd been around before for playdates with Kino and stuff, and she'd gone to other meetings — though they were mostly younger than her, first children or kids with smaller age gaps than our family. Some of them were kunoichi, though none that I knew personally — they just moved, reacted, had chakra smoothened and sharpened like kunoichi. Some of them were civilians but married into ninja families; I assumed there were different groups for totally civilian parents.</p><p>The idea started to percolate in the back of my brain, while I stepped carefully around the bags and babies filling the room and carefully loaded up some plates to take outside. Sasuke balanced the tray with the teapot and cups on it on my head, to the startled laughter of one of the more civilian-feeling ladies.</p><p>I winked at her and made very sure it was stuck with chakra before I moved.</p><p>Outside, I dropped my writing desk out of hammerspace to use as a low table to set the food on instead of just putting it on the ground, then absolutely retreated back to a quiet corner out of the way. And by 'corner out of the way' I meant, 'branch in a tree not easily seen from the house'.</p><p>Discretion was the better part of valour, as the saying went.</p><p>"So?" Sasuke asked, once he was done also helping — and possibly after having been coerced into holding babies while everyone moved from the house to outside. Which I'm sure he hated to the very bottom of his soul.</p><p>"So?" I echoed, raising an eyebrow back.</p><p>"Manpower," he prompted, continuing our earlier conversation. "We're looking at, what? A hundred, a hundred and fifty people, preferably trained shinobi — without draining resources from War Operations or even really from General Forces." He looked frustrated. "There aren't that many unemployed shinobi just… hanging around in Konoha."</p><p>"You think?" I asked. Not sarcastically, but because the idea had already turned itself over in my head. I looked past him, back at the group of women with my mother.</p><p>Some of them were kunoichi. Most of them — if Mum was any indication — would never return to active duty.</p><p>Sasuke tilted his head. "Okay," he said slowly. "But…"</p><p>But there was a reason they would likely never return to active duty.</p><p>I nodded. "Yeah, I mean, it wouldn't be <em> easy.</em> But, like, the Police Force is Konoha based, doesn't leave on long missions, and has regularly scheduled shift work, right? Add in a few perks like a daycare, after academy training for older kids, or half shifts and we might be able to lure in enough of them. Maybe even… open up some of the old district as housing to offer as an additional incentive? That would appeal to non-clan shinobi, I think."</p><p>I glanced carefully at Sasuke to see how he took that suggestion, but he looked more thoughtful than offended.</p><p>"Regardless of who we get there's going to be a lot of retraining," I said, getting into my stride. "Crowd control and deescalation are different tactics to pretty much anything we do in the field — a think there should be a standard: barrier seals, maybe a few paralysing genjutsu, maybe a few other containment practices. You don't have to be very high rank to manage those. And while it'd be good to have some higher level ninja on hand, there's also the option of just sending a runner to the Jounin Relief Station for backup if a confrontation contains <em> actual</em> jounin."</p><p>"So it doesn't matter if we recruit people who've been out of the field for a while," Sasuke said.</p><p>"Right," I agreed. "As long as they're willing to meet whatever minimum standard we set…" I swung my legs off the sides of the tree branch, mind spiralling in a hundred different directions. "Besides, how many ninja would think twice if they know the police are going to show up and it'll be <em> their mother.</em> "</p><p>That made him smirk. "We'll, it'd work on you and your brother," he said.</p><p>"Damn right it would," I agreed. I hummed thoughtfully. "The after school training might actually be really useful."</p><p>I'd thrown it out under the idea of 'childcare' but the more I thought about it, the better it seemed, especially if we were shifting our focus to non-clan shinobi — the ones without the extra at-home training that gave kids the edge at the Academy. Not just as a selling point for the parents, kids with more experience in what the police force did would be more likely to join it themselves when they graduated.</p><p>"I don't think we could employ academy students," Sasuke said doubtfully.</p><p>I waved a hand. "That's not what I meant. Not like that." More like… a Boy Scouts, JROTC type thing. Not that Sasuke would know what that meant. "Junior Police Training? Though actually, now that you mention it…" I narrowed my eyes thoughtfully, staring blankly to the distance.</p><p>"I <em> really</em> don't think we could employ academy students," Sasuke repeated.</p><p>"Not those ones," I said, trusting him to keep up. "But what if we added another year onto the Academy program? Called it… internships or something. Do a three month rotation in, say… the police, the hospital, the tower and village guard duty? While still getting class time with a teacher or some kind of individual training program? Technically they'd have graduated and be genin, or deferred genin or something… it'd free up higher ranked shinobi, extend the graduating age, provide them with safety to get better training, introduce them to different aspects of the village…"</p><p>Sasuke was nodding along with me, looking amused. "I think Hokage-sama told us to fix the police, not the Academy."</p><p>I shrugged a shoulder, smiling brightly. "Always going above and beyond, that's us."</p><p>I really didn't think Tsunade would protest. Particularly not if it kept us occupied for her allotted time frame.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Police Arc: Chapter 147</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Super thanks to Frolic, Pepperdoken and MathIsMagic.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 147</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality. ~ Yoko Ono</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Creating new training programs from scratch — or at least, the very general basics of a training program — was fun in a way that untangling the knots of police history wasn't.</p><p>For the Junior Police Cadets I drafted a quick mock up of a badge system, like I remembered from Girl Guides. Badges were great; kids loved badges. I had, back then, anyway. I'd collected all bar one. They could have sashes too, like we had had, which were cute <em> and</em> didn't violate any Konoha Uniform Regulations in ways that a bandana or vest might have, because Konoha didn't use sashes as signs of rank anywhere.</p><p>Actual content was going to require <em> much</em> more thought. I had a few ideas, and so did Sasuke, based on our own clan training and things that we <em> technically</em> had learnt at school but probably could have stood to practice more.</p><p>The internships though — that was harder. My rough idea was to divide the graduating year into four and then rotate them through the four departments for three months each. The internal training for each department wasn't really the issue (or well, the police might be, but not yet) because three month rotations were already a thing that the village did, just not for Academy students. The issue was what <em> additional</em> training should be happening during that year as well.</p><p>"Maybe we should ask someone," I suggested finally. "A teacher someone."</p><p>"Iruka-sensei?" Sasuke suggested because that was basically the only teacher we kept in touch with. Other than Kakashi-sensei, who would be absolutely worse than useless, even if he had been around.</p><p>Which was why the two of us rocked up to the Academy just after school hours let out, dodging the outrush of students to make our way inside to our old classroom.</p><p>The dulcet tones of Iruka-sensei's yelling at someone — Konohamaru, as it turned out — echoed through the hallways.</p><p>I knocked awkwardly on the doorframe of the open classroom door.</p><p>"You can go," Iruka-sensei said to Konohamaru. "<em> This time.</em> "</p><p>Konohamaru took his opening and darted past us, chirping, "Hi, nee-chan. Hi, nii-chan!" and nearly tripping on his scarf.</p><p>"Shikako-chan," Iruka-sensei said, "Sasuke-kun. Can I help you?" He rubbed the back of his neck.</p><p>"We had some questions about training systems," I said. "And I figured 'who better to ask than Iruka-sensei?'"</p><p>"For your police assignment?" Iruka-sensei confirmed, proving that he was indeed up to date on all the gossip. Not that that was a particularly secret bit of information. "I don't know if I'd be much help. You might be better off asking Yuuhi Shinku — he runs the Genin Corps Training Program. The Corps admin building is that old stone one down past Genki Sushi, you know the one."</p><p>I hadn't had much to do with the Genin Corps really; barely knew very much about them, beyond that they were the largest faction of the Forces and that the Corps in general did a lot of the low level, manual-labour-type grunt work and civil infrastructure like maintaining the roads around the Land of Fire. And the non-classified (and therefore largely civilian) postal service.</p><p>"It's not just the police though," Sasuke said. "We had a few ideas about Academy students. Or, well, recent graduates."</p><p>"If you've got time," I added, because Iruka-sensei sometimes seemed like he was single-handedly attempting to run the entire village with how many things he was involved in.</p><p>"A few minutes," he said. "I have a shift at the missions desk soon, but if you make it quick…"</p><p>Which meant we'd probably intrigued him. Didn't mean he would necessarily help out, but curiosity was our foot in the door here.</p><p>We gave a quick run down of our ideas, and Iruka-sensei seemed genuinely surprised by them. "That's… bold," he settled on, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p><p>I nodded. "I mean, we might as well suggest as many outrageous things as we can. They'll probably get scaled back before implementation, but that just means we should dream big at the start."</p><p>"We've got a few ideas of things that the cadets and the internships should cover," Sasuke said, shrugging. "But you probably know more than us about what they should be learning."</p><p>I nodded. "Yeah, I mean, ideally… if you had your students for an extra year what would you teach them?"</p><p>"More survival skills," he said immediately. "More first aid. Maybe another E-rank jutsu or two. Actually, there's a lot of more individual skills we just don't have the resources to teach — sensory skills, tracking, pretty much any weapon other than kunai and shuriken." He glanced away. "I suppose a lot of the survival skills fall under that umbrella too; that's why they're left to the jounin-sensei. Hard to teach snowcraft in the middle of Konoha."</p><p>Unless you had some kind of artificial biome or something. I put a pin in that thought for later, however interesting it was.</p><p>"Could you make us a list?" I asked, politely. "I don't know if we could do much about resources, but it sounds like you have a few ideas."</p><p>He looked a little rueful, like he'd been caught out. "A few, maybe. I'll see what I can do."</p><p>"Thank you, sensei!"</p><p><hr /></p><p>Since Iruka-sensei had mentioned him, I decided to see if I could track down the Genin Corps instructor guy. That <em> did</em> sound like a thing that would be relevant and useful.</p><p>(Sasuke had something that might or might not have been an ANBU Captain meeting to go to. He'd been vague. Maybe he just didn't want to come.)</p><p>I'd never been to the Genin Corps building before — hadn't given much thought to it <em> not</em> being in the Tower like the rest of the admin offices. There were enough people trickling out of the place, given that it was near the end of the day shift, that I managed to catch someone who could direct me to Yuuhi Shinku's office. Or at least, the floor that his office was on.</p><p>It appeared to be fairly standard. A reception desk near the stairwell, a large open office with half a dozen desks – currently empty – and two offices lining the back wall. One was empty and had it's lights off, the other had an older jounin working at a desk.</p><p>The guy at the reception desk looked up politely. He was maybe thirty, with a solid moustache and his headband worn sideways so that the plate was above his left ear. He was wearing a sweater vest over a button up and had no weapons at all that I could see.</p><p>Right. Genin Corps.</p><p>"Hi?" I asked. "I'd like to talk to Yuuhi Shinku, if he's available."</p><p>The guy at the desk – I shamelessly snooped at the documents he'd been working on and found his name was Manabu Akado – pulled out an old fashioned diary and laboriously turned to the current date, running his finger down the page until it hit three o'clock. The last two slots were blank, and had been blank for several pages; clearly Yuuhi was a guy that liked his last hour before home time to be clear. I could sympathise with that.</p><p>Akado checked the clock. It was three twenty seven. I'd made good time from the Academy.</p><p>"Yuuhi-sensei is free until four o'clock, Special Jounin-san," he confirmed. "Then his shift ends."</p><p>I thanked him, even though that had been a <em> process</em> for something I could pretty much deduce right from where I was standing. All it had needed was 'yes, he's here'.</p><p>I strolled across the office area and knocked on Shinku's door. "Excuse me," I said brightly, stepping inside. "I'm-"</p><p>"No," the Jounin at the desk said, without looking up.</p><p>I blinked. "What?"</p><p>"If you wish to speak with me, you shall make an appointment," he said, stiffly. "I have neither the time nor inclination to speak with every undesirable that wanders in off the street. And <em> also</em> , I have not given you leave to enter my office. It is common courtesy to wait until one is acknowledged and invited to enter."</p><p><em> Wow.</em> Even Tsunade wasn't so pointlessly strict about office etiquette, and she was the damned Hokage.</p><p>I could feel the rising itch to dig my heels in, to pick a fight. This was nothing, really. An annoyance, a mild irritation, something that on a good day I'd probably have shrugged off, let run off my back like water and forgotten about the instant it was over.</p><p>(I'd dreamed about red sky and people dying. Over and over and over again, until it was almost boring.</p><p>Today was not a good day.)</p><p>This guy was as good a target as any. Did he want pain in the ass formality? I could <em> do</em> pain in the ass formality.</p><p>I took one step back, until I was <em> just</em> outside the line of the doorway. "Akado-san," I called over my shoulder without taking my eyes off of Yuuhi. "Could I please book an appointment for three thirty?"</p><p>"Certainly, Special Jounin-san," Akado said, pulling out the diary again and adding a note to it. "Your name?"</p><p>"Shikako Nara," I said, and Yuuhi looked up from his desk for the first time, eyes narrowed. I took just <em> the tiniest bit</em> of satisfaction in the recognition. <em> Yeah, that's right. Your boss is my dad. </em></p><p>The clock on the wall ticked over. Three twenty eight. I settled into alert readiness, like at the start of a fight, and kept my eyes on Yuuhi. I wasn't putting out Intent or anything like that, nothing that could be misconstrued as actually aggressive, but no ninja who had enough fighting prowess to make Jounin would feel particularly at ease under a gaze like that.</p><p>Three twenty nine. Three thirty.</p><p>Akado got up from his desk, plodded across the room, squeezed past me and bowed to Yuuhi. "Your three thirty appointment is here, Yuuhi-sensei," he said dully, like this wasn't an enormous farce. I was inordinately fond of him for it.</p><p>The tendon in Yuuhi's jaw pulsed.</p><p>"Hi, Yuuhi-<em> san</em> ," I said with a pleasant smile over a shark grin. I waited, because I'd won that round and now he <em> had </em> to invite me in and therefore concede the second round as well.</p><p>He waved me in, looking like he'd bitten into a lemon. I stood in front of his desk, which meant he had to look up at me. Because he hadn't told me to take a seat and it would be rude to just take one without invitation. Obviously.</p><p>Of course, now I'd committed to talking to the guy, which was probably punishment in itself.</p><p>"I hear you're an instructor in the Genin Corps?" Goading him probably wasn't smart, not when I'd actually come here with the intention of having a productive conversation, but hey, I wasn't going to be the first one to cede ground.</p><p>"The <em> Head Instructor</em> ," he said, icily. "Which means the appropriate honorific is 'sensei'."</p><p>"Oh, I see," I said, wide-eyed, like I hadn't noticed Akado calling him that and then… deliberately didn't. Technically it would be polite for me to use it, especially since I was asking about <em> teaching</em> . But also technically I wasn't under his chain of command and he'd certainly never taught me. "That's very interesting Yuuhi-san."</p><p>Yeah, this was so promising.</p><p><hr /></p><p>I was still annoyed by Yuuhi freaking Shinku the next day. It wasn't like I'd expected <em> everyone</em> to jump at my command and help me — but he hadn't been unhelpful as much as—</p><p>"— a complete <em> jerk</em> ," I said to Sakura, flopping angrily onto a bench in the meeting hall that Anko had organised for this week's Kunoichi Meeting. I slashed a hand through the air like this would increase her understanding of how much of a jerk he had been.</p><p>Sakura seemed insufficiently sympathetic. "You poor thing," she said. "I had to remove a grape from someone's nostril in the ER this morning."</p><p>"Okay," I said grudgingly. "You win. That seems gross." I eyeballed the crowd for anyone else who would be more interested in getting outraged with me. Maybe Yakumo; I didn't normally <em> complain</em> about things to her but she did have experience with old jerks. It was a pity Ino wasn't here — though on second thought maybe she'd just find it funny.</p><p>"<em> Who</em> is a jerk?" Someone asked behind me, also sounding like they found it funny.</p><p>I twisted to find Kurenai-sensei watching me with a smirk badly hidden behind a paper cup of steaming coffee.</p><p>Kurenai <em> Yuuhi</em> . "Ah," I said, connecting the dots far too late. I had been fairly loud, hadn't I? "Um. I mean. I'm exaggerating. It wasn't that bad."</p><p>She slid onto the bench beside me and I hastily sat upright. "Oh, don't censor yourself on my account. Please, tell me all about how my father is a jerk."</p><p>I winced, sliding down the scale from 'awkward' to 'mortified'. Bad enough if he'd just been clan, nope he had to be her dad. I'd really put my foot in it.</p><p>"That wasn't sarcasm," she added, when I didn't say anything. "I do mean it. What did he do?"</p><p>I shrugged stiffly. "Ah, Iruka-sensei suggested I talk to him about the Genin Corps training system. Because, we're trying to put together things for the Police Force. But, um. He didn't want to talk to me."</p><p>I probably hadn't really <em> helped</em> matters very much but things had definitely started off on the wrong foot and only gotten worse.</p><p>Kurenai-sensei took a sip of coffee. Then pulled out a hip flask from the loose bandage folds of her dress and added a generous dollop of something clear and alcoholic smelling. She stirred it in with the little plastic stirrer. "Do you know," she said. "He once told me I couldn't go and fight in a battle because I owed him grandchildren."</p><p>"Wow." I carefully didn't think about how Kurenai-sensei might just, if things went the way they had in that story, have a kid reasonably soon. But deciding to have kids on your own was incredibly different to someone telling you that you <em> had</em> to have them. "I think if someone said that to me I'd rip my uterus out with my bare hands and throw it in their face."</p><p>Kurenai-sensei laughed like my threat of gore and violence was adorable hyperbole.</p><p>"If you're looking for someone who knows a lot about teaching," she said, "you could try Ebisu."</p><p>"Oh, Ebisu-sensei!" I'd completely forgotten about him. She was right — Ebisu had basically made Special Jounin for teaching and Kakashi-sensei obviously regarded him highly enough to ask him to train Naruto.</p><p>"He lives in the Hiruko Apartments," she added, taking another sip of her drink.</p><p>I blinked in surprise. It seemed a little… forward to give me his actual home location, even I could have looked it up in a registry, since that wasn't one of the unlisted apartment buildings. Still, I probably would have tried to track him down during working hours rather than <em> go to his house</em> . Though now that I knew where it was, it was <em> by far</em> the easiest option and I'd probably do it.</p><p>"1210," she added, like maybe that wasn't enough information. "The apartment right next to Gai-sensei."</p><p>I blinked again, but this time for a different reason. I <em> knew,</em> logically, that Gai-sensei must have Lived Somewhere. He couldn't just exist in a perpetual state of Training around the village. And having an apartment obviously meant that that apartment had neighbours and <em> therefore</em> there were people out there who existed in a state of Living Next To Gai-sensei…</p><p>Not that Gai would be a bad neighbour. So long as you were adjusted to the usual ninja eccentricities like strange hours, window usage, occasional loud noise and Kakashi.</p><p>"Right," I said and cleared my throat, a little worried that Kurenai-sensei was going to keep giving me alarming information. "I'll ask him."</p><p><hr /></p><p>I did go to Ebisu's apartment later that afternoon — late enough he'd probably be home, not so late that it was rude — feeling a <em> little</em> like Kurenai-sensei had compelled me, even though she hadn't done any more than offer me helpful information and I was practically immune to genjutsu.</p><p>Still. Awkward.</p><p>There was chakra inside Apartment 1210, so I knocked politely on the door. Ebisu didn't go directly for the door, instead stopping a little to the left — either door traps, or something to check the identity of a visitor.</p><p>Apparently I passed, because the door opened. "Ah, Shikako-san," Ebisu said, straightening his glasses. "How unexpected."</p><p>"Yeah, I'm sorry to just drop in on you like this, Ebisu-sensei," I said. "Um. You might know that Sasuke and I are drafting a proposal for the re-establishment of the Military Police and, um, we need a little help trying to design the training programs."</p><p>"And you came to me. Well!" He looked… pleased, shoulders drawing back and chest puffing out, just a little. "I would be honoured to help. But of course, that is a serious request! Not something I can do instantly."</p><p>"Of course," I agreed amicably. "I thought I would book a meeting room at the Tower if you have, um, a preference for time? Outside Academy hours, probably, since I hope I can get Iruka-sensei's input as well."</p><p>I hadn't, previously, thought about it but it wasn't a bad idea anyway. Get us all together at least once to hash things out, rather than me running around doing all the communicating. Excellent.</p><p>"Later in the evening would be preferable," he said, "since I still work with the Honourable Grandson in the afternoons."</p><p>I wasn't sure if that was still his assignment, since… well, since the Third had passed on — if it had just carried on because no one had changed it — or if he was doing it of his own volition.</p><p>"That should work fine," I said. "Um. Would you like a short introduction to what we're considering? Or I can write some notes up for you. Or. Go over it at the meeting, I guess?"</p><p>Ebisu appeared to give this a moment of serious consideration. "I suppose I do have a few moments," he agreed. "Please come inside. Would you like something to drink? Tea? Coffee? I only have instant, I'm afraid, though it wouldn't be a problem to borrow a filter jug from a neighbour-"</p><p>I came inside and carefully stepped out of my sandals. The place was spotless, minimally decorated and pretty standard for a shinobi apartment, though there was a large corkboard on the far wall that was absolutely plastered with note paper and sticky memos.</p><p>"Tea?" I offered, mostly to stop the patter of offerings and not because I intended to stay long enough that hot drinks would be required. "Tea would be fine."</p><p>Of course, then it was polite to actually wait for it to be made. I took the chance to look around a bit further, and since the only thing of real interest was the corkboard, that was what drew most of my attention.</p><p>At first it was just a confusing mishmash, and I nearly assumed it was all in code — anything <em> I</em> made would be — and then I saw the names of the Academy three jutsu and a number for repetitions and it all fell into place.</p><p>"Oh," I said, "are these training programs?" No wonder Kurenai had directed me here. Not only was Ebisu-sensei was a teacher; he actually had experience with the very thing we needed.</p><p>Belatedly, I realised that maybe I wasn't supposed to be looking at these. If they were designed for someone in particular, they'd probably be confidential.</p><p>"They are!" Ebisu-sensei said, right behind me with two cups. I took one, cradling it in my hands. There wasn't exactly a table because these one room apartments weren't that big, so we just stood a tad awkwardly in front of the board. "Or, at least, potential training programs. None of them have been implemented."</p><p>"For the Academy?" I guessed.</p><p>"No," he answered, surprising me. "For the Genin Corps." He adjusted his sunglasses, like a nervous tick. "I came from the Corps, you know."</p><p>I hadn't known that, actually. "I… hadn't given it any thought," I said.</p><p>He nodded, like he'd read my surprise. "Indeed! I was lucky enough to be chosen for a genin team after a year, and through hard work and determination was able to become a Chunin and then the Special Jounin you see before you! But I have never forgotten where I came from, and I wish to help the others who were in my position."</p><p>I nodded. "Makes sense," I agreed. "So, uh," I tried to think of a polite way to ask <em> why aren't they implemented?</em></p><p>"Every year since I became Special Jounin I have made a submission to the Genin Corps with a new and improved training program," he sad. There was a touch of odd pride to his voice.</p><p>I had no idea how many years Ebisu had been Special Jounin for, but it was probably a few.</p><p>"Wow," I said. "That's a lot of work." Especially given that I suspected he meant 'new' as in 'from scratch' not just 'slightly different'.</p><p>"Yes." He nodded again. "Yuuhi Shinku has rejected every single one."</p><p>My already low opinion of Yuuhi Shinku took a nose dive through the floor and started digging.</p><p>"Wow," I repeated, with a different intonation. I considered the pages and pages of notes and the amount work and mentally extrapolated that for <em> years</em> . "You know. I think we can work with this."</p><p>"Pardon?" Ebisu-sensei asked.</p><p>I smiled. "Okay, so, we're actually working on three separate training issues," I said, then explained the whole police, internships and Junior Police Cadet thing. "But if we include attempting to recruit police from the Genin Corps, I don't see why we couldn't also suggest a comprehensive overhaul of the Corps training program. <em> Obviously</em> we need to ensure they're up to standard."</p><p>"Well," Ebisu-sensei said, sounding just a touch bewildered.</p><p>But I was on a roll. "This proposal goes straight to Tsunade-sama," I said, "Since she's the one that commissioned it. If you attach your submission to it, then there won't be a chance for Shifu or whoever to reject it." I gave a sharp nod. "Under your own name, obviously. Maybe we can officially hire you as a contractor? There's no reason you shouldn't be credited for it."</p><p>Could I do that? I had no idea but surely I could. When people suggested building new infrastructure they didn't do the whole design themselves. It was about project coordination. And stuff.</p><p>"And like. Maybe even suggestions for the General Forces as a whole? I know some people at the Tower have problems meeting their OR hours — maybe there should be classes they could attend. Or. Or seminars for new skills."</p><p>Training, once one was out of the Academy, was mostly a self motivated process. Or a clan motivated one, when you had a clan. Even situations where you kept working with your Jounin-sensei weren't really all that common.</p><p>"Oh yes!" Ebisu said, getting some enthusiasm back. "There's a deplorable lack of options in the General Forces. At the very least there should be a process for partnering up shinobi with compatible training goals, or those that are willing to pass on skills to other ninja. Many skills require the student to already have a solid base of knowledge, so it isn't feasible to attempt to teach them at the Academy — but that's no reason for them to <em> never</em> be taught!"</p><p>I nodded, completely in agreement. "We should definitely consider this as part of our suggestions, too."</p><p>I'd already proven with the Nara Clan Sealing Group that a reasonably short training program could pay dividends and while I didn't think there would ever be an open, village-wide sealing course — the security issues, yikes — the concept would work for other skills easily enough.</p><p>"Yes, yes," Ebisu muttered. "I will… I will write some notes." He was staring at the corkboard like he wanted to get started <em> right away.</em></p><p>I finished my tea and quietly put the empty cup down on the kitchen counter. "I will... book us that meeting room," I said, sidling towards the door. "And send you the details. Thank you for your time!"</p><p>I slipped my shoes on and ducked out at Ebisu-sensei's distracted-sounding farewell.</p><p>It wasn't much further to stop by the Tower on my way home, so I figured I might as well do it immediately. Technically speaking, most Jounin projects were merely contributory — they were done in your own time, with your own resources, and submitted when complete. But ours had literally been assigned to us by the Hokage; I had a mission scroll and a mission number to go with it.</p><p>So I shamelessly used that to book a meeting room at the Tower under the guise of an official mission. And then — more out of pettiness than anything — I used it to request the assignment of a particular Genin Corps member as an administrative assistant for the whole thing.</p><p>The justification? As the secretary for the Head Instructor, Manabu Akado was familiar with the current training regime and therefore held all the information that we needed. Which would probably be helpful. But mostly it was just because it was the fastest way to disrupt Shinku's careful scheduling and obvious desire for things to happen Exactly As He Planned every day.</p><p>If it turned out that requesting an assistant was not under the purview of this mission, then I'd pay the reimbursement fee, no problem. I was willing to pay real, actual money to ruin Shinku's day.</p><p><em> Because Ebisu-sensei</em> <em> looked sad</em> , I justified internally.</p><p>I handed the forms in to the missions desk to get the meeting notices delivered; I hoped Iruka-sensei wouldn't be too surprised that it was now formal enough to have a meeting instead of just catching up with him when we had time.</p><p>The missions desk handed me something in turn.</p><p>"Oh, nice," I said, absently, reading it over. "Hey, do you know if Ibiki-taicho is in right now?"</p><p>It was late so he might not have been — this wasn't an urgent missive so it had probably just been waiting for me to pick it up or would get delivered to my in-tray in the Tower — but it didn't hurt to ask.</p><p>Or it didn't hurt <em> me. </em> The desk nin went about two shades paler, which was a bit of an extreme reaction to Ibiki's name, but one he'd probably find funny. "Let me check," he said, and pulled out the logbook to check the daily sign-ins. The logbook wasn't always correct, but it was <em> kinda</em> necessary to know where the department heads and other people of importance were.</p><p>"He should be in, uh," the desk nin said, "in his office."</p><p>"Neat," I said, a little amused at the circumventing of his department name. But then again, I probably didn't want to drop 'Torture and Interrogation' in a crowded mission room either. "Thanks."</p><p>I hopped down the levels to T an Intel ninja signed me in when I showed Ibiki's note and led me towards his office. Ibiki was carefully filling in some forms when the Intel ninja knocked on his open door, which he slid in to a folder and out of sight before I entered the room. Obviously not classified if the door was open, but not something he wanted me to look at either.</p><p>"Ah, Shikako," he said, smiling a little. "I wanted to talk to you about a meeting."</p><p>I squinted at him. "I booked that, like, literally ten minutes ago. There's no way you can know about it." The note had been <em> almost definitely</em> older than that.</p><p>He folded his hands. "I think you will find," he said with grave seriousness, "I know everything that happens in this village."</p><p>I snorted, startled into gross laughter.</p><p>His facade cracked. "I have no idea what meeting you're talking about," he admitted. "But we spoke at New Years about your plans for the police and it seemed worth following through on it."</p><p>I grinned, collapsing down into the chair opposite his desk. "Oh, right," I said. "I haven't actually got much further with working out how to separate or integrate the police and Intel responsibilities. We got a little sidetracked considering the manpower issues and what kind of training the police will need. That's the meeting I booked, just now."</p><p>"A little preemptive," Ibiki said. "If you haven't worked out what the police will be <em> doing</em> ."</p><p>I bobbed my head in a quick nod. "Yeah, it kinda… spiralled into a thing. It'll probably evolve as we go along, so I'm not too worried about getting ahead of ourselves."</p><p>"Interesting," Ibiki said, like he had seen about three layers through that explanation. I wasn't entirely sure there were three layers below it, so, good on him? "I think I should send someone to attend this meeting of yours. On behalf of my department. Anko Mitarashi, possibly."</p><p>I blinked. "Yeah, okay?" Then considered his choice. "Yeah, actually Anko-senpai would be a great choice. She's been running the Kunoichi Club so I'd probably want her input anyway."</p><p>I hadn't really realised she was back to working for the Intel Department, since last I'd known she was Jounin-sensei to Sakura's team during the Mist Exams. But they'd all made chuunin, and Sakura definitely wasn't a full time, active duty field ninja, so even if she was still in charge of them that probably didn't take up all her time. And I had no idea what her new jounin duties were so it made sense.</p><p>"Excellent," he said. "As for settling the issue of police duties…"</p><p>"Name a time and place," I said.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Super thanks to Frolic, Pepperdoken and MathIsMagic.</p><p>Also, Frolic, our super organiser, has been giving the reddit some new life. reddit r/DreamingOfSunshine</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 148</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones ~ John Maynard Keynes</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>Since I figured that I mostly had all my ideas in order anyway, the largest part of my preparations for the training group meeting — did we need an official name for this? — was to buy a catering box from an Akimichi bakery and take it to the tower; if I was going to ask a bunch of people to do me a favour, at least I could make sure we were appropriately fed.</p><p>Judging by how heavy the box was, possibly <em> over</em> fed.</p><p>I felt like this was a good decision, until I got to the meeting room itself and found that Ebisu had arrived even earlier than me and had brought with him half a dozen A2 sized posters and was busy taping them to the front wall.</p><p>There was an alarming pile of things on the desk.</p><p>"Ah, Shikako-san! I will be done in a moment," he assured me. "I was simply getting set up."</p><p>I smiled back, dropped the catering box on the desk and made a retreat. "Absolutely! I will be right back. There's just... a... thing. A thing I need to do first."</p><p>That thing was <em> definitely</em> ask what I'd got myself into.</p><p>I mean, I knew what I'd gotten myself into and why, but that had been a brief flash of dawning premonition that maybe I'd bitten off more than I could chew.</p><p>I just, you know, could put that off for the ten minutes it took for the meeting to actually start. And then I'd have backup in the form of everyone else who had been suckered into this drama.</p><p>This decision satisfied me and I lurked casually around the tower corridors for a few minutes, until I sensed someone very slowly making their way up the stairs. So slowly it was unusual, and therefore attracted my attention even over the busy hum of Tower activity.</p><p>I tucked my hands into my jacket pockets and wandered down the stairs, prepared to just casually pass by and take a gander at what was going on.</p><p>What it turned out to be was Manabu Akado — and he was going slowly because he was carrying the meeting scroll, a briefcase, <em> and</em> a typewriter while attempting to match the meeting room number with the barely advertised floor levels in the stairwell.</p><p>"Good afternoon, Akado-san!" I said, cheerfully. "Need a hand?"</p><p>He startled, like he hadn't noticed me standing there, and the typewriter slipped out of his grip, starting its slow collision course for the ground.</p><p>That was some <em> terrible awareness</em> , since I hadn't been sneaking, not even a little bit. And he still wasn't wearing anything even remotely resembling a weapon.</p><p>I stepped forward and caught the falling object, lifting it out of the air before Akado had time to protest, and examining it with a vague disinterest. It wasn't like I was unaware that Konoha <em> had</em> things like typewriters — tech levels were all over the place and not all that accessible — but there were enough typed forms coming through that it was a background fact. It was just that, personally, I found them irritatingly inferior to a computer keyboard and I was pretty sure that I could write faster than a typewriter could keep up with.</p><p>"Ah, good afternoon, Nara-san," he said, papers fluttering in his hands. "I hope I'm not late! I was having a little trouble finding the correct room."</p><p>"Not at all, not at all," I dismissed. "You're still early. We're up another couple of floors; I can show you where it is."</p><p>I hefted the typewriter, which was a little awkward and bulky but not really an issue, and motioned for Akado to follow me. I didn't ask about it, but apparently the potential of a question was still enough.</p><p>"Ah, yes," he said, hurrying after me. "I wasn't entirely sure what the system is at the Hokage's Tower so I requisitioned a typewriter from the Genin Corps to bring with me, just in case there wasn't one available here."</p><p>I made a noise of understanding even that only answered, like, half my question. "But no storage scroll?" I asked, because that would have been a much easier way of transporting a thing.</p><p>"Oh, I didn't have the authorisation to requisition one," he responded, which actually took me a second to parse.</p><p>Well, yes. I supposed that technically storage scrolls were office equipment. And therefore would be under the control of whatever requisition system existed in the department — and I <em> supposed </em> that if you weren't a field shinobi you probably didn't just <em> have</em> storage scrolls.</p><p>Although there were probably a fair number of field shinobi that didn't have them either. I ran my tongue over the barely perceptible water seal on the inside of my cheek.</p><p>Weird.</p><p>Those people were not living their best lives.</p><p>"Well," I said. "Remind me before the meeting ends and I'll make sure you've got one. No point you lugging this around when there's an easier way."</p><p>"Oh, I wouldn't want to make problems," Akado said.</p><p>"Trust me," I said dryly. "That's really not going to be a problem."</p><p>We arrived at the meeting room, which was slightly more intimidating now that there were complex charts taking up three walls, but on the brightside, Anko had also arrived and opened the snack box in order to help herself.</p><p>I set the typewriter down on the table and Akado gingerly settled himself into a seat, opening his briefcase to reveal a pretty well organised stationery set up and starting to put things on the table.</p><p>"Hey," Anko said, waving lazily. "I told you, kid, you should have just taken the Kunoichi Club. It'd have been way easier than all this."</p><p>I shrugged. The Kunoichi Club was the <em> last</em> thing I was worried about. "Oh, we'd probably still have ended up stuck with it but then I'd have <em> two </em> things to do," I said. "And then I wouldn't have been able to ask my Anko-senpai for advice, would I?"</p><p>"Flattery gets you everywhere," Anko said, grinning. She slouched down in her chair, looking relaxed. "Ibiki is pretty interested in whatever you've got going here," she confided. "So I expect it to be good."</p><p>"I hope we live up to your standards," I said dryly.</p><p>Sasuke and Iruka-sensei arrived; Sasuke just turning up casually in the room without actually opening either the door or window — which was just <em> showing off</em> — and Iruka-sensei bustling in with an armload of papers and apologizing about being late.</p><p>I looked at the clock. "Yes, those thirty seconds are really setting us back, Iruka-sensei," I said dryly. I stood up and awkwardly dusted my hands. "I guess we should get started then."</p><p>Akado raised his hand. "Should I… take the minutes?" he asked.</p><p>"That's a great idea," I answered, seamlessly, as though I had planned for anyone to actually take minutes and not just, like, remember stuff. "Thank you for offering. Uh, this is Manabu Akado from the Genin Corps training program, Anko Mitarashi who runs the Kunoichi Group, Iruka Umino from the Academy, and Special Jounin in tutoring, Ebisu. And Sasuke Uchiha, who's the other project head alongside me."</p><p>Most of the introductions were for his sake, because I was pretty sure everyone else knew each other, if only in passing. But it did sound nice and official and like everyone had valid reasons for being here.</p><p>"Oh, <em> Ebisu</em> ," Akado said with recognition. "I've read some of your training proposals! They were very clever. I know Yuuhi-sensei has always rejected them, but we did implement a few of the suggestions individually."</p><p>Ebisu looked very pleased. "Well," he said, adjusting his glasses. "I didn't know that. I'm glad to hear it!" he said, as though actually making changes was his goal and he wasn't the slightest bit disappointed that he'd received no recognition for it or even been notified.</p><p>I quickly rattled through the set up of what we'd initially thought for the Police Force — the Force training itself, the Junior Police Cadets, the internships — and then gratefully sat back down and handed the entire thing off.</p><p>Ebisu started with, "Yes, I considered what you suggested and had some thoughts," and then he and Iruka-sensei pingponged back and forth in a slightly frightening manner.</p><p>Anko started off much slower; which was fair considering she hadn't had the spiel before.</p><p>"Are... you suggesting changing the <em> entire </em> village training system?" she asked, slightly bemused.</p><p>"Obviously any massive change, like what we're suggesting for the police, is going to have carry over effects on other departments," I said, trying not to sound <em> too</em> much like I was rehearsing bureaucratic legalese to get away with something. "We're simply looking at the scope of maximum change to make sure that we account for all those effects." I widened my eyes innocently. "We wouldn't want to cause any chaos to the functioning of Konoha by implementing changes that aren't fully understood."</p><p>Anko chuckled, low and throaty. "You don't have to convince <em> me</em> ," she said. "I've seen enough gaps in the system already."</p><p>That was more interested and invested than I would have predicted. Then again, she was a Jounin-sensei — to some… nonstandard students, even — on top of running the Kunoichi Club so it wasn't like she didn't have experience and input.</p><p>"Yeah," I admitted. "We're looking at changing the whole system."</p><p>No one had told us to. But equally… no one had told us we <em> couldn't</em> . And wasn't that what jounin projects were all about? Identifying things that could be changed for the better?</p><p>Correct.</p><p>I wrote that down and underlined it, along with my earlier statement to Anko. I had a feeling I'd need to repeat them to Tsunade.</p><p>Ebisu brought up some great ideas about general forces training — like optional classes for OR hours, sign up sheets for those willing to teach particular skills, teaching classes for those <em> willing</em> to teach, discussion groups like this one for people aiming for jounin — which I agreed with. The changes to the Genin Corps I was less familiar with, but after a few questions, Akado seemed willing to speak up and engage with Ebisu so that all seemed to be in good hands.</p><p>To be fair to the Genin Corps: it did what it was supposed to do. It channeled a very large number of people into an effective work force that ran consistently in the background without ever really drawing attention. And I bet that 90% of the time, that was perfectly fine and there were plenty of people who wanted a stable job delivering post without the risk having to fight S-rank ninja.</p><p>But that didn't mean it couldn't be done <em> better.</em> That there weren't ways to be more efficient, to reduce injuries and increase skill sets. And the edge cases, the people who wanted to, or were skilled enough or determined enough to move into the General Forces… there needed to be something for them, so those skills weren't wasted.</p><p>I withdrew a little, met Sasuke's eyes who shrugged at me like 'this is your doing' and then started to doodle a storage seal on a scroll for Akado, because I had said I'd give him one.</p><p>It wasn't a hard task and definitely didn't keep my attention, which was why I was watching his hands fly over the typewriter, and noticed the particular set up of paper and white out and ink and notepads and pens he had arranged all around him. And all of that could <em> definitely </em> have fit in one large storage seal, but it amused me to create specific and tiny ones, dividing the scroll further and further into zones of use.</p><p>Then I flipped it over and wrote another storage seal on the back, labelled 'desk' because you might as well have <em> all</em> the things you needed with you. And I'd had to borrow Tenten's camping table to use as a desk, back at the Chunin Exams in Grass, which was an oversight I'd since corrected.</p><p>The scroll ended up being the seals equivalent of a colour coded binder, and I scrawled 'Manabu Akado's storage scroll' at the top in pretty calligraphy because a) I didn't want it assumed to be a <em> requisitional</em> <em> scroll</em> and taken from him and b) I was pretty sure it'd never be useful to anyone else ever anyway.</p><p>We segued into the Academy curriculum, because the internships meant we were effectively slapping another year onto the graduation age and <em> surely</em> that had to come with changes. Iruka-sensei seemed like he'd been building up quite the wishlist over the years.</p><p>"Should we add something about the Mist Academy?" Sasuke asked, rolling a pen around on the table looking bored.</p><p>"Oh," I said, blinking. "I'd forgotten about that."</p><p>"Mist Academy?" Iruka-sensei asked.</p><p>"When we were in Hidden Mist for the Chunin Exams we were shown a tour of the village and Academy," I explained. "Their new Academy is very heavy on practical teaching — they have no actual classrooms, just training halls. More physical learning would be a benefit to kinesthetic learners, but it would definitely require more teachers and a more hands on teaching style."</p><p>"And removing theoretical study would be detrimental to the training of our medical and administrative staff," Sasuke added, which I was pretty sure was a direct quote of what Tsunade herself had said at the time.</p><p>"Fascinating," Ebisu murmured, adjusting his glasses.</p><p>That sounded… slightly dangerous, but I nodded and smiled anyway. "Yeah, I don't know what they did before but it sounded like Zabuza had basically created their new Academy from scratch. Probably from his own experiences training Haku."</p><p>There was a strained silence.</p><p>"Zabuza Momochi is teaching at the Mist Academy?" Iruka-sensei asked, sounding slightly strangled.</p><p>I glanced at Sasuke, slightly confused. He shrugged, no help.</p><p>"He's the Head of the Mist Academy," I answered. "But yeah, I think he does teach there? And was the Jounin-sensei to Yoro and Shiku's team. At least during the Grass Exams."</p><p>"And during the Mist ones," Anko said, then shifted a shoulder when attention was drawn to her, slightly defensive over it. "What? We hung out. Jounin-sensei to Jounin-sensei. He seemed nice."</p><p>I nodded at her. Anko knew what was up.</p><p>"Please tell me as much as you know," Ebisu requested, eyes gleaming, "about their teaching style."</p><p>And in the following <em> interrogation</em> wanted to know far more details than either Sasuke and I had had access to in the five-minute tour that Mei had allowed us.</p><p>"It could be something to consider for the internship kids," Anko said, when it became increasingly clear that there were no answers to his questions, because she was an actual star. "They ought to be doing the theoretical part in their actual job, right?"</p><p>Which brought up the next issue; I was convinced that a year of part-time work in various departments would be a <em> really good idea</em> both for kids and the departments themselves, but Iruka-sensei was worried that conditioning and field training would lapse during that time.</p><p>It <em> was</em> a solid concern. But also the same kind of concern that applied to the shinobi forces at large.</p><p>By the time the meeting ended, it was late, we had zero solutions and many questions, Ebisu-sensei was practically vibrating with excitement and I was sure that this was going to be a completely over-the-top disaster.</p><p>Eh, it would probably work out.</p><p>"I think we should have another meeting like this," Ebisu-sensei said, carefully pulling down his now-heavily-annotated posters. "It was very productive. There are so many different angles that we should consider and explore." He glanced at me. "Of course, I don't mean to overstep…"</p><p>I waved my hand. "Overstep away," I said. "I'm perfectly happy to hand this part off to you, if you want." Which would be <em> ideal</em> from my point of view, though really a little rude to just… give Ebisu so much extra work.</p><p>I packed up my own stuff, and slid Akado's new storage scroll to him. "Oh, here. Before I forget. You've used a storage scroll before right?"</p><p>"I have," he answered, and unrolled it slightly to glance at it. Then he unrolled it completely and intuitively matched it up against his desk set up on the table. "Oh, wow. This is… impressive. Where did you get this? Did you… make this?"</p><p>"Well, yeah," I said awkwardly. I didn't think anyone had been impressed at a storage scroll since I was in the Academy myself. Even the whole NaraTen seal thing hadn't really been <em> impressed</em> as much as… <em> extremely irritated.</em> "It's no big deal. Just… consider it a thanks for your help, okay? I know this was kind of out of the blue for you."</p><p>"Oh, of course, Nara-san. Anytime!"</p><p>"Oh, that looks very useful," Iruka-sensei said, admiringly.</p><p>I glanced at him, but he didn't seem to be being facetious. I was pretty sure Iruka-sensei could make basic storage scrolls — it wasn't much more of a step up from there to make a dozen on one scroll. Overkill, sure, but not that much more complicated. I'd done it, before Tenten had created a superior option.</p><p>"Well, if you want something similar let me know," I offered, though somewhat dubiously.</p><p>"<em> I</em> might want one," Anko said, leaning on the table, though with a smile that said she might not have been entirely serious. "For Yakumo."</p><p>"I should probably have thought of that," I said, slightly chargined. I'd suggested Yakumo look into more combat oriented uses of her technique, but when she'd sparred with me she'd still required a whole… set up. "She'd probably want… something for an easel, right?"</p><p>"It'd be good if she were able to unseal a couple of things at a time without having to go through <em> everything </em> or having to carry multiple scrolls around," Anko said. She tapped her fingers thoughtfully.</p><p>Though like really, there probably should be a way to trigger all the seals together as well and just… instantly set up the whole thing.</p><p>"Okay, okay." I waved a hand. "Anyone who wants one just… draw up a scroll with whatever sections you want. Um, if we're going to be having another meeting, I can do them then."</p><p><hr /></p><p>It seemed every time I turned around there was more work to do; the Nara Sealing Group managed to schedule time with a seal expander, which was useful for a) teaching them about compressed seals and b) getting another glance at how they worked myself so that I could finish the final rough edges on my seal microscope glasses. And Takatori wanted my opinion on a variant tracking seal that he wanted to use to catalogue books in the research library.</p><p>I bounced some ideas around with him, but like a lot of the projects that individuals in the Sealing Group were starting to run with, there wasn't actually a lot of help I could offer once they started adapting things to their own areas of speciality.</p><p>I could probably help them even less than they could help each other, if I was honest.</p><p>And that was on top of team training and ANBU training and medical training, so it wasn't like I wasn't busy. But somehow, over the next few days, I found myself drawn back to the police headquarters, even though we'd gone through and found anything relevant. It wasn't that I thought we'd missed anything — we'd been really thorough — it was just…</p><p>I didn't know.</p><p>It was so quiet. So obviously abandoned, so far out from the nearest lively part of the village, that it should have been creepy. It was creepy, a little, especially when I had flashes of knowing people had died here — not just vague general awareness but their <em> faces and names and how they'd gone</em> — but mostly…</p><p>Mostly it was just sad.</p><p>I cleaned up, because we'd been efficient but not tidy, and modified my skin cleaning jutsu to slide chakra across the walls and floors and pull the dust off into a contained chakra bubble that didn't cause it to rise up into a tornado and smother me.</p><p>See? Progress.</p><p>But there were so many small things, so many touches of who these people had been. There were photos, scattered around the bulding — a group picture on the wall of everyone at some kind of festival or picnic. One in Tokimi's desk of her and her daughter Uzume, laughing merrily next to a stone faced Hyuuga man in an ill fitting police uniform. Koyane had one of him and a Nara — Kasuga-oji — drinking tea and playing shogi looking like disapproving old men.</p><p>I didn't want this. These people were dead and gone. There was nothing I could do for them, nothing I <em> could have done</em> for them. I didn't want to think about them as having had lives and dreams and connections.</p><p>But I set the photos aside gently, anyway. They could probably go up on the walls when the police were re-established. I wasn't the only one who shouldn't forget. The rest of the personal effects I neatly sealed away, labelled with names, so that all that was left was typical office furniture.</p><p>And then Sasuke <em> also</em> turned up at the police headquarters, and we stared blankly at each other. I felt a little like I'd been caught doing something I shouldn't have been doing.</p><p>"Were you… looking for something?" he asked, eyes flickering around the room.</p><p>I shrugged. "Mostly just cleaning," I said lamely. "I figured this would still end up being police headquarters so… it would need to be done eventually."</p><p>Sasuke nodded, not quite looking like he bought it, but it was the only reason I <em> had</em> so, that was all he was getting.</p><p>"You?" I asked, changing the subject. He had a set of files in his hand. "Are those the unsolved cases?"</p><p>"Yeah," Sasuke said quietly. He brushed past me to sit down at one of the desks, dropping the files on the top of it. "I don't think there's anything we can do with this one," he said, a twist to his lips that was too sour to be described as 'rueful', as he slid one across to me.</p><p>I hadn't been paying too much attention to those, if I was honest. They were interesting as examples of <em> how</em> things had been done, and that was important, but they were cold cases by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>"What is it?" I asked, with mild trepidation, because Sasuke was hard to shake.</p><p>There could be a lot of awful things hidden in those files, now that I thought about it.</p><p>He swallowed and shook his head. "The official ruling was suicide," he said.</p><p>I leaned on the desk and opened the file. The first page was a neat handwritten case summary, a photo clipped to the top left – clearly an official ninja ID. An Uchiha, maybe around fifteen with short spiky hair. He was smiling in the photo.</p><p>I skipped my eyes over it, to the investigation. <em> Uchiha Shisui.</em> It was dated three days before the Massacre.</p><p>"Oh," I said, lamely.</p><p>"Yeah," Sasuke said, with a humourless smile. "They even—" he faltered. He braced his elbows against the desk and hunched forward, like he'd been winded.</p><p>I waited. He wanted to say this. Or needed to. Or… had prepared to, or something like that. I wondered how long he'd been going through these cases – I'd never considered there might be something about the massacre in them, had assumed they'd probably be as distracting for him as throwing about new training ideas was for me.</p><p>Clearly, I had been wrong. So wrong.</p><p>And now I just had to ride out the tidal wave of disaster that had sprung from it.</p><p>"The day before," Sasuke said, voice so measured and precise that it was nothing but the most extreme act of will. "They – the police – they came to our house. Said Shisui was dead; accused Itachi of killing him." He inhaled sharply, like it hurt him to say. "I thought he was going to fight them. He was so <em> angry.</em> Even then I was frightened."</p><p>I swallowed. Was there even anything I could say here? Anything that would mitigate, would soothe, would somehow lessen the pain?</p><p>The truth weighed heavily in my throat and it had never seemed more impossible to speak.</p><p>"Shisui was his <em> best friend,</em> " Sasuke whispered, like that explained everything. "Of course I didn't believe them. But what if we <em> had</em> ?"</p><p>I closed my eyes for a brief moment. Oh, no. That was worse.</p><p><em> What if there were warning signs and we ignored them? What if there had been something we could have done?</em></p><p>"I think," I said, carefully measured. "That some things get set in motion a long time before we ever see them and by the time we do see them, it's already too late because too many things have happened along the path."</p><p>Would it have changed anything? Maybe. Maybe not. I didn't know. Because Itachi hadn't been the root of the problem, as it were.</p><p>Sasuke sighed and pressed his fingers against his closed eyes. "Yeah," he said. "And anyway. That's not the whole… just read the file okay?"</p><p>With some reluctance, I did. I wasn't exactly sure what Sasuke wanted me to see, but I supposed it would be obvious enough to jump out at me.</p><p>It didn't at first — because it was something I knew, was something <em> so obvious</em> I overlooked it. And that would have been hard to explain.</p><p>"His eyes were missing," Sasuke said, when I stalled on the autopsy page. "After the shrine... "</p><p><em> The eye from thy brother is eternal</em> .</p><p>The autopsy report suggested, sounding dubious itself, that they'd been eaten by fish in the river — gross — but the complete lack of other soft tissue damage and the fact that they'd fished him out within a day didn't really support it.</p><p>Which left Itachi as the prime suspect.</p><p>Which I guessed was better than suspecting the truth — I didn't really want Sasuke going after Danzo for eye related crimes. I didn't think that was a fight we would win.</p><p>"Well, that... sucks," I said, stilted.</p><p>Sasuke huffed, not quite a laugh. "Yeah, it sucks," he said. "Do you think you could make a seal?" he asked, abruptly changing the subject.</p><p>I blinked rapidly and didn't quite follow. "A specific seal?" I asked, because <em> obviously</em> I could make A Seal. What he wanted it to do was the question.</p><p>"You know." He traced a finger along the underside of his eye. "To keep them where they should be. I know the Hyuuga have one. I bet you've been studying it."</p><p>"Huh." I tilted my head. "I mean. For a given value of study, where I have no access to any information about it. Yes, kinda. I've mostly been thinking about… well… countering it, which, uh. Is probably illegal so let's not mention that. But it wouldn't be impossible to create something similar…"</p><p>I let Shisui's file flip closed, so he was no longer staring at me accusingly, and tapped it against my palm.</p><p>Obviously there were definite aspects of the Hyuuga seal that were coming <em> nowhere near</em> my friends, but on the whole, the concept of 'prevent eye theft' wasn't bad. I would very much like Sasuke to not get his eyes stolen too, even if I didn't think Itachi was likely to be the culprit.</p><p>…But that was another issue, too, wasn't it? If Sasuke ended up going Mangekyo blind, I didn't want my seal preventing him from treating that.</p><p>"I will… start drafting ideas," I said, distracted thinking about it.</p><p>Something infinitesimal relaxed in his shoulders. "Thanks."</p><p><hr /></p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Police Arc: Chapter 149</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Thanks to Frolic, Pepperdoken and MathIsMagic for all the neat discussions about DOS and Naruto.</p><p>This chapter took a long time and a lot of false starts to write, scenes that fell flat, subplots I can't introduce yet (or at all) and for personal reasons I've lost a lot of my interest in this arc so am trying to wrap it up satisfactorily.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 149</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> Time flies over us, but leaves its shadow behind. ~ </em> <em> Nathaniel Hawthorne</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>In the end, when we gave Tsunade our report on the police reinstatement, it was very low key. We all knew the report was kind of a formality and not particularly <em> urgent</em> and I'd kind of thought we'd just hand over the report and that would be it. Instead, Tsunade arranged a private dining room at a restaurant and we had a <em> business dinner</em> .</p><p>Fancy. There were privacy seals humming in the walls and the servers knocked and waited before entering the room. It wasn't like we were going to be discussing anything <em> classified</em> but it was confidential information.</p><p>"Okay," she said, setting the report on one side of her plate and glancing through it. "Sell me on it."</p><p>I looked at Sasuke. Sasuke looked at me and shrugged.</p><p>"Okay," I said, and started in on The Spiel. It wasn't like I hadn't given it a million times to convince people to help us.</p><p>Tsunade wasn't a passive listener, asking probing questions and clearly having some idea where we were going with everything – either from keeping up to date on what we'd been doing or simply because it was the obvious outcome – but we did surprise her in some places.</p><p>The long drawn out 'huh' when we brought up the departmental budget – or lack thereof – was definitely one.</p><p>"Obviously it wasn't really a sustainable setup," I said, voice casual and attention more focused on picking through the food I'd been served. The beef slices looked a little too red and still bleeding for my tastes, so I passed them off to Sasuke. <em> No thank you.</em> The eggplant dish was good though.</p><p>"I know the Senju used to be heavily involved in funding the hospital," Tsunade said thoughtfully, eyes narrowed into the distance like she was digging through her memory. "But it was village funded by… at least by the Second War."</p><p>That was an interesting factoid. Because the initial founding of Konoha and creation of all these systems and services had probably been wild. No excuse for it remaining that way for so long though – not when Tsunade had just confirmed that <em> other</em> things had been treated sensibly.</p><p>"We drafted a probable budget," I went on, "but you probably want someone who… knows department budgets to redo that."</p><p>"Oh, yes," Tsunade said, with the tone of someone about to face many arguments, "I'm sure I will get <em> plenty </em> of opinions on the topic."</p><p>Better her than us, really.</p><p>She was also surprised by our suggestion of <em> where</em> police recruits could be found.</p><p>"I had heard you were clashing with the Genin Corps," she said, guardedly, "so I had assumed you were recruiting from there."</p><p>"That's a different issue," Sasuke said dryly.</p><p>I resisted the urge to elbow him in the side. "It wouldn't be <em> bad</em> to recruit from the Genin Corps," I said. "But then <em> they'd</em> be short staffed. Same as if you took ninja from any active duty posting. So we were looking for alternatives."</p><p>Tsunade nodded and the conversation paused while she actually read though that page thoroughly. "And do you have any suggestion for who would <em> lead</em> this team?"</p><p>Not particularly, because it wasn't like I knew that many people who specialised in <em> running departments</em> . Ibiki, but he was clearly very settled and happy in the posting he had. And it would be a bad look to go from TnI to Police.</p><p>"Tsume Inuzuka?" Sasuke suggested.</p><p>I nodded. "She runs the Sensory Squad, has plenty of leadership experience, and is well respected." And would probably understand the challenges that kunoichi-with-kids would experience. "She's probably already super busy, though."</p><p>Tsunade went 'hmm' in a way that was neither approving or disapproving. Which was fine, we didn't want to actually be responsible for selecting people <em> for</em> the police. From there it seemed like an alarmingly small step to being… responsible… for the police.</p><p>We were well finished eating by the time she'd run out of questions to ask us about it. The waiters had brought her some sake to drink, but both Sasuke and I stuck to tea.</p><p>"Alright," she said finally, levelling us both with a serious look. "Where does this 'separate issue' come into it?"</p><p>There was a hint of warning, a 'this better not explode in my face' edge.</p><p>I shifted uneasily but it wasn't like we'd done anything <em> wrong.</em> "Well," I said. "Along with looking for people to recruit, we started looking at how to train them, because obviously police work is going to be substantially different from, say, active duty or admin duty. So we went to the experts for advice. And – well, the Genin Corps guy wouldn't help us but the other people we asked really came through."</p><p>"Above and beyond?" Tsunade asked, relaxing a little now that she could see where this was going.</p><p>"Very," Sasuke said.</p><p>I did elbow him that time. "The project ended up getting a little too big to just append to ours," I said. "And I wouldn't have wanted to take credit for all their work, so I suggested we present it separately. So, uh, if we could arrange a time to do that?"</p><p>"How many people are involved in it?" Tsunade asked, taking a drink.</p><p>"Six," I responded. "Including me and Sasuke."</p><p>It didn't sound like a big group but, comparatively… that was two three-man-squads. It'd take a big mission to get that many ninja sent out together so it probably was kinda impressive to get that many people working together on training plans.</p><p>Tsunade swirled her drink thoughtfully. "I'll get my secretary to schedule something and send out meeting notices," she said. "Who's involved?"</p><p>She was completely unsurprised by Ebisu and Iruka, raised an eyebrow at Anko and completely failed to react to Akado's name – though I had no doubt she would absolutely look up his service record before the meeting occurred.</p><p>Still, that was a relief all around.</p><p>"Oh, and?" Tsunade said, once we had finished up and stood to leave. "Congratulations on your promotion."</p><p><hr /></p><p>That meeting took place about a week later – the earliest Tsunade had been able to schedule us in by the sounds of things. I'd been given the meeting notice in my tower in tray the morning after my promotion, when I'd been running around trying to make that official.</p><p>There had been – of course – promotional paperwork to be filled out. I still technically had a 'specialisation' in Sensing and was attached to the Sensory Squad, but I no longer had my rank <em> under</em> the sensory squad.</p><p>Which mattered very little in practical terms but quite a bit in paperwork terms - either that or people had been taking the chance to run me around, but I figured they really had better things to be doing.</p><p>Ebisu was early – of course – and well prepared with handy visual aids – of course – and even Anko seemed less informal than normal. This was, after all, a meeting with Tsunade.</p><p>Akado had set up his little station but was quiet and stiff as a board – if he'd been overwhelmed by a scroll from <em> me</em> arranging a meeting, apparently one straight from the Hokage's Office had given him a heart attack, no matter how much warning he'd had.</p><p>Tsunade swept in precisely on time and sat down at the head of the table, which had been Clearly And Obviously left for her. "Alright," she said, glancing around. "What am I looking at?"</p><p>Everyone looked at me.</p><p>I made <em> handing off</em> gestures towards Ebisu, who adjusted his glasses nervously. "Well," he said. "We have identified several ways in which the current training system in Konoha can be improved. Not that there are problems! But obviously it can be better."</p><p>"The Academy system hasn't been updated since the last time the graduation age was changed," Iruka said, a little less inclined to prevaricate. "And that was just to limit early graduations. With the changes Shikako and Sasuke wanted to introduce, it seemed a good time to look at a complete overhaul."</p><p>Tsunade nodded. "And what changes are those?" she asked. "Take it from the top."</p><p>After that slightly stilted start, things went far better. Once they got back into the swing of things, the <em> clear and blinding enthusiasm</em> aspect carried them along.</p><p>Tsunade didn't appear particularly <em> displeased</em> by any of it, which was something. No guarantee anything would <em> happen</em> or happen as this project suggested but it was promising.</p><p>"I don't know how many of these suggestions are feasible to implement," she said, finally, when everything had been explained to death. "Now or in future. But the fact that there are so many suggestions – so many <em> good</em> suggestions – tells me it's something I need to seriously consider." She tapped her nails against the desk. "As far as being an application for promotion…"</p><p>"Hokage-sama," Ebisu said seriously, adjusting his glasses. "While I would be honoured to be considered, that isn't-"</p><p>She held up a hand to interrupt him. "This is <em> exactly</em> the kind of thinking that I want in my Jounin," she said. "On that basis, I would agree whole heartedly. However, given the current situation… While combat prowess isn't the be all and end all of rank, I don't want to make larger targets of people than they can handle."</p><p>"Oh, I can make sure he's up to scratch," Anko said, with a grin that was probably not at all reassuring when you were on the receiving end of it.</p><p>Tsunade considered them for a moment, then nodded. "I'll be monitoring your progress," she said with a clear kind of underlying <em> I expect you won't let me down</em> . "Therefore, I hereby promote you to the rank of Jounin. I'm going to temporarily grant you the title of … Education Reform Overseer, and part of your new duties will be the implantation of some of these suggestions after further review."</p><p>I politely applauded. Ebisu looked a little gobsmacked but, you know, in a pleased way.</p><p>Tsunade's gaze swept along the table. "Manabu Akado. Given the recommendation of four Jounin and one Special Jounin, I'm more than willing to grant you the promotion to the rank of Chunin and attach you to the Education Reform Committee."</p><p>"Thank you, Hokage-sama!" Akado squeaked, looking just a little like he might pass out.</p><p>Beside him, Iruka-sensei glanced around the table with a kind of dawning look of horror, apparently realising that Tsunade's count didn't <em> quite</em> match up.</p><p>"Tsunade-sama," he stammered. "I <em> like</em> teaching at the Academy."</p><p>"And we don't have enough decent teachers that I'm in any hurry to remove you from it," she answered smoothly. "But you didn't think you could draw attention to a problem like this and just walk away, did you?"</p><p>Oh boy I hoped that was possible, because it sure was what <em> I</em> intended to do.</p><p>"I grant you the title of Special Jounin, in teaching, and expect your continuing input," she finished smoothly.</p><p>"Yes, Tsunade-sama," he said weakly. "Of course."</p><p>So all in all, I figured that was pretty successful.</p><p>It wasn't until later that I found out from Ebisu what the Education Reform Committee was up to.</p><p>"It's cross departmental," he told me. "We have people from the hospital, the Genin Corps… it's very promising."</p><p>"Oh yeah?" I asked. "The Genin Corps are listening now?"</p><p>His smile was <em> definitely</em> smug. "Yuuhi-sensei did, of course, raise some concerns in the initial meeting," he said. "But Tsunade-sama was <em> most clear</em> . I believe her exact words were 'you misunderstand, Yuuhi. You aren't 'taking suggestions into advisement'. He outranks you – you'll do as you're told or I'll replace you with someone who will'."</p><p>I may or may not have cackled. No one would ever know.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Having been promoted, Tsunade no longer had real excuse to keep Sasuke and I both close to her chest. But she did low ball us some easy missions to start with.</p><p>"A courier mission to the west outposts?" Sasuke repeated.</p><p>"Correct," Tsunade said, unimpressed with his unimpressed-ness. "Thanks to our new storage scrolls, you'll be transporting a large amount of supplies, and therefore will be a tempting target. But, theoretically, it should be a reasonably safe outing."</p><p>I nodded. "Of course, Tsunade-sama," I said because it didn't <em> really</em> matter how boring the mission was.</p><p>And it did end up being pretty boring. We got the lists, sourced the materials from the supply depts, packed the scrolls and headed out. It was an easy run to the River border and we didn't encounter any enemy ninja and/or invasions from other continents. Easy peasy.</p><p>The outpost commander took their portion of the supplies and then sent us onwards to the smaller way stations on our route. Which was where we encountered our first surprise.</p><p>Team Gai was stationed there. Minus Gai-sensei who was probably somewhere a little more visible and important, but it was nice to see them. They'd been in and out of Konoha a few times that I was aware of, but I hadn't had much time to catch up with them.</p><p>"Neji is in charge," Tenten confided. "I mean, it's only a tiny way station, but that's something, right?"</p><p>"Absolutely," I agreed. "Congratulations." I was pretty sure Neji wasn't far off a promotion of his own, and being in charge here made it seem like an even safer bet.</p><p>Neji nodded back, almost gravely. "Congratulations yourselves."</p><p>"Yeah, they finally let us out of paperwork hell," Sasuke said. "Got anything interesting happening around here?"</p><p>"It's been quiet," Neji said, shaking his head. "Thankfully so." His foreboding look said he would prefer it if it remained that way.</p><p>Well, not every mission could be interesting. And it wasn't like we didn't have ANBU to keep us on our toes. I'd thought that, maybe, once we were promoted our ANBU missions would dry up, but</p><p>Red team had been busy – at first Tsunade had seemed to think that our only skill was Big Natural Disasters, but there's only so much map changing that can happen and <em> country rearrangement</em> was kind of a touchy subject.</p><p>Anyway, we turned out to be pretty good at <em> subtle</em> too, if by <em> subtle</em> you meant 'no one would have ever guessed'<em> . </em> We faked assassinations, pretended to be ghosts -</p><p>("That's not going to work," Towa had said, crossing his arms when I'd suggested it. "No one believes in ghosts."</p><p>Hawk-taicho had remained silent.</p><p>"Taicho," Komachi had asked cautiously. "Do you believe in ghosts?"</p><p>"I've <em> seen ghosts</em> ," Hawk-taicho said, sounding betrayed that he'd had to make those words in that order with his real actual mouth and sound crazy, when both he and I knew it was true.)</p><p>- caused inconvenient mission collisions for other nations until they all gave up and went home in disgust, occasionally stole or altered some evidence and, to counterbalance, occasionally broke into places to leave other new evidence behind.</p><p>You know, normal fun things.</p><p>So I was a little surprised when Cat-taicho requested me for a mission with <em> his </em> team. Well – he'd requested and Tsunade had assigned me, so it wasn't like I had a choice or anything, but Hawk-taicho didn't seem impressed when he was presented with those orders.</p><p>"We need a specialist," Cat-taicho said, patiently. "I will bring her back in one piece."</p><p>"You better," Hawk-taicho grumbled.</p><p>"I am perfectly capable of bringing myself back in one piece," I said primly, and followed Cat-taicho to the briefing room.</p><p>There was another ninja there, one with an old Crow mask who <em> definitely</em> had enough seniority to be a captain himself. And Kisuke. Who was a ghost.</p><p>That was an intimidating team up.</p><p><em> Well, don't I feel out classed.</em></p><p>But the joke never made it to my mouth because on the wall was a map of the Land of Rice Fields with four marked pins.</p><p>Hidden Sound bases.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Yes. I know it's short. Yes, it's this or nothing. Thanks.</p><p></div> </div> <div> </div> <div></p>

			<h2>Rice Fields Arc: Chapter 150</h2><p><div></p><p>Title: Dreaming of Sunshine</p><p>Summary: Life as a ninja. It starts with confusion and terror and doesn't get any better from there. OC Self-insert.</p><p>AN: Thanks to Frolic, Pepperdoken and MathIsMagic for all the neat discussions about DOS and Naruto.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Chapter 150</p><p><hr /></p><p><em> All theory, dear friend, is gray, but the golden tree of life springs ever green. ~ Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</em></p><p><hr /></p><p>We overnighted on the Fire side of the Fire-Rice border, well behind our own outpost lines, and prepared to cross into enemy territory with the dawning sun. It lost us the cover of night, which we might otherwise have wanted to aid in stealth infiltration, but the trade-off of having better lines of sight ourselves was deemed worth it.</p><p>The real worst case scenario on this mission was running into Orochimaru himself, and we wanted to do everything we possibly could to avoid that.</p><p>"We'll do reconnaissance first," Cat-taicho said, gathering the team together for a last minute huddle.</p><p>We had covered our orders and supplied intel in the mission briefing in Konoha — extremely thoroughly, with a lot of information that could have only been gained from an inside source, including basically a layout of the place. It might have been dated, and Orochimaru certainly <em> knew</em> that he had an information leak so it wasn't quite solid, but it was still a lot more than most missions could ever hope to get — but Cat-taicho apparently liked to double and triple check everything.</p><p>"We want to be <em> absolutely sure</em> ," he stressed,"that Orochimaru or his lieutenants aren't in the base before we close in on it. If they are, we abandon mission. We're here to retrieve information and to sabotage as much of his operation as possible — <em> not</em> as a hunter-nin squad."</p><p>"Taicho," I said, trying to sound serious. "If Orochimaru is here I'm abandoning mission, even if I have to throw you all over my shoulder to do it."</p><p>Cat-taicho only huffed a little at the interruption. "Let's hope it doesn't come to that," he murmured.</p><p>"While it's unlikely that he would be employing such measures within his own facilities," Crow said, "it can be assumed that Orochimaru does have methods to evade identification by the Byakugan."</p><p>I wasn't familiar with Crow, but his chakra was had the same <em> clear</em> quality as Hinata and Neji, if jagged like crushed and shattered glass. A Hyuuga, almost certainly, and he'd only just confirmed it.</p><p>During the chunin exam preliminaries, Orochimaru had stood in a room with the Hokage, with a whole host of Jounin, including Kakashi-sensei and Gai, with two Hyuuga utilising their bloodlimit for combat, an Inuzuka, and an Aburame. And that didn't count how he'd gotten into that room in the first place.</p><p>You <em> bet</em> he had techniques to avoid detection.</p><p>Cat-taicho nodded, mask bobbing up and down seriously. "If anyone has reason to doubt that the coast is clear, we will abort mission. While I am eager to destroy as much of his… work as we can, there's no denying that we wouldn't stand a chance in a fight."</p><p>"Especially as the team's combat capacity is down a man," Kisuke pointed out. "I'm strictly reconnaissance, these days."</p><p>I wondered how much of <em> that</em> story the other two ANBU knew. Even if they knew about Kato-esque spirit walking techniques, using one twenty-four seven was … unusual. Bound to stand out and cause questions, even in the technically-no-questions zone of ANBU.</p><p>Those weren't questions <em> I</em> was going to get answered, because Cat-taicho just nodded to concede the issue.</p><p>"Crow will take point until we reach the Kawada river," he continued, back on track. "At which point we will disperse and plant the seal tags for Kisuke. We'll triangulate around the presumed location of the Sound base. Kisuke will travel with Bat — you <em> are</em> comfortable with how to plant the Spiritual Waypoint tags?"</p><p>"Yes, taicho," I said because it wasn't like I could say I'd <em> invented</em> them.</p><p>Kisuke was still attached to the main Soul Detachment Seal that Sasuke and I had found him in — with my aftermarket modifications — but to increase the distance he was able to travel from it I'd needed to invent a way to extend his range, independent seals that acted like radio transmitters, creating an area that he could… <em> hop</em> across. So long as we managed to plant them in the right places around the base, Kisuke should have full access to it without anyone noticing.</p><p>"It's vitally important that the seals are placed correctly," Cat-taicho pressed. "Kisuke's… unique talents won't work if they're not in place."</p><p>"I <em> know</em> , taicho," I insisted.</p><p>That seemed to get through. He paused. "Have you worked together before?" he asked, mask tilting sideways a little in consideration. It was a typical ANBU move — body language adapted for wearing a mask — but also one I'd seen Tenzou use outside of the ANBU halls.</p><p>"I legally can't answer that question," I said, promptly.</p><p>He took a very deep breath and let it out in a long sigh that was <em> extremely</em> familiar from watching Tenzou interact with Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>"Can't you just say 'it's classified' like a normal person?" Cat-taicho complained, so yes, it was exactly like watching him interact with Kakashi-sensei.</p><p>"We haven't, Tenzou," Kisuke said, spoiling my fun winding up our captain. Or at least, giving him the hint that if we had, it wasn't as <em> Bat</em> .</p><p>It seemed odd for him to refer to Cat-taicho by name but then… Tenzou was ANBU through and through. 'Tenzou'might have <em> been</em> an ANBU name as well. And it wasn't as if Kisuke himself was wearing ANBU gear — just casual clothes — since he couldn't exactly get changed. This team clearly didn't abide by such strict masks-on policy as Red Team.</p><p>"But I can talk her through them, if there seems to be a problem," he continued. "That's why you're sending me with her, isn't it?"</p><p>Cat-taicho said, "Yes," very unconvincingly. Which definitely meant he was sending Kisuke with me because he suspected I'd get into trouble, and not just because I was the rookie of the team. I'd have taken offense but on the off chance that he was right I wouldn't mind backup.</p><p>"We have permission from the outpost," Crow said, breaking into the conversation. Since I'd seen no such signal, I assumed he had his Byakugan active. "We should go before the gap in patrols closes."</p><p>Ideally, even <em> our</em> ANBU shouldn't be able to slip through our patrols, even on secret missions, and everyone liked to believe that, so there was a process to signalling to the outpost and receiving permission to pass. And of getting up to date intel from the outpost, if required.</p><p>With absolute silence, we leapt into motion and cleared the border. There was no comparative security on the Rice Fields side, which was slightly unnerving. No security usually only mean <em> no security you knew about</em> , especially when you were facing someone like Orochimaru.</p><p>On the other hand, there <em> was</em> the distinct possibility he just… didn't care.</p><p>The country itself was, contrarily, both hilly and exposed, with the hillsides carved into flat terraces for rice paddies, and winding roads between them. There was no foliage, no cover — the rice paddies that were empty were just flat water, and even the highest grown of the rice plants were only up to my waist.</p><p>In efforts of speed, we did not army crawl through the rice fields to stay below the line of sight, just trusted in our stealth jutsu and range of awareness to keep us from nearing people and attracting attention.</p><p>In the areas of the country that were <em> too</em> mountainous to even turn into terraces, which would be next to inaccessible to civilians given the number of sheer vertical cliffs there were more familiar trees — as large if not larger than any that grew around Konoha. It was nice to get back into proper cover, but the downside of approaching somewhere Orochimaru might be — at the very least where he had been and left terrible things behind — dampened the feeling somewhat.</p><p>"We meet back here at sundown," Cat-taicho reminded us. "If there are any problems, send up the signal and abort immediately. If you see someone else send the signal, <em> immediately </em> return to the outpost in Fire Country. Any questions?"</p><p><em> What's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?</em> probably wouldn't go over well. "No, taicho," I said.</p><p>"Right, let's go."</p><p>We dispersed. Kisuke switched into full ghost mode, becoming invisible to everyone except the person that carried his seal, which was me. It meant I didn't have to worry about anyone spotting him, just about keeping myself hidden.</p><p>The location of the Sound Base, according to our intel, was directly to our west of our meeting spot. Cat was going to circle to the north, and Crow was going to go south and around to the west and I had been given the nearest triangulation point to plant a seal that was nearly a straight run from where we were. The overlapping radii of the three seals would give Kisuke plenty to work with.</p><p>It was hardly a difficult task — go, apply seal to a hidden spot, done. Kisuke politely started to hover slightly further away, now that he could, but didn't take off to reconnoiter just yet, and probably wouldn't until at least one of the other tags had been planted.</p><p>Which left us to do a thorough but normal sweep of the location. There were a few towns nearby — one near the river that was nearly abandoned and another further away that seemed slightly better off but still like it had fallen on hard times. I didn't get too close, because there were plenty of people there and many of them seemed to have chakra too high to be <em> just</em> civilians but unless it was a decoy town for the Sound base, we weren't actually here to mess up the locals.</p><p>Further along my sweep, I found something that was <em> much</em> more interesting.</p><p>There was a ninja in the forest writing seals onto the ground.</p><p>She was dressed plainly, a full ski mask across her face and head, with orange hair peeking messily out the base of the cap. No identifying symbols or village insignia. Nothing to say who she was or what she was doing.</p><p>Interest caught, I circled around in the canopy, jumping branch to branch until I could get a look at what she was doing.</p><p>"Bat?" Kisuke said, warily. "I don't think you should get too close to that."</p><p>It looked like she was using an obscure variant of circular sealing, which wasn't something I was incredibly familiar with — Konoha used spiral sealing from the Uzumaki as the closest comparison and even that wasn't a huge part of my repertoire — and I could only slightly parse what it was for. It <em> looked</em> like a barrier seal, but somehow inverted, which was… interesting.</p><p>I got the answer to that question sooner than expected, when she activated it. The seal created an upside down pyramid of an almost oily looking chakra barrier appeared digging into the dirt beneath the seal, carving chunks of ground away and making it collapse. It didn't make a shallow cut, either, digging at least two stories down.</p><p>The seal maker staggered back, seeming not quite prepared enough for the way the ground crumpled beneath her, but recovered from it well enough.</p><p>As the barrier was dismissed and the dust raised by the destruction cleared, it became obvious that she had chosen her location well. The way that the ground had been carved in had severed an underground tunnel in half and since I knew who had underground lairs in this particular area…</p><p><em> Interesting.</em></p><p>Maybe very foolish, though. Far be it from <em> me</em> to cast aspersions on anyone who wanted to attack a castle singlehanded, but it wasn't exactly a thing that was easy to pull off.</p><p>"We need to pass this information to Cat, immediately," Kisuke stressed. "If there's another group attacking at the same time, our purposes may cross."</p><p>But there wasn't a group here and now. There was just her.</p><p>And inside the tunnel — inside the base it was connected to — people were responding. A strong chakra signature had honed in on the break in and was getting closer by the second.</p><p>The ninja threw a handful of smoke bombs down the opening, ones powerful enough that when they exploded a wave of smoke flooded back out. It probably would be pretty overpowering inside the tunnel, and might not have been a bad strategy — but the Sound nin just charged right through it, leaping up and out and nearly skewering the intruder before she even had time to enter.</p><p><em> Didn't capitalise on your opening fast enough,</em> I thought, even though it wasn't like I had the chance to offer constructive criticism.</p><p>She ducked and weaved back, avoiding the first charge and attack with more grace than expected, striking back with rapid fire taijutsu and jumping back for distance.</p><p>"Sasame!" the Sound ninja — a tall guy with purple hair — yelled out, sounding more irritated than one should technically sound when yelling at an enemy. Familiar. "What do you think you're <em> doing</em> ?"</p><p><em> Ah,</em> I thought, disappointed despite not being involved at all. <em> She's a Sound ninja too?</em></p><p>"Arashi," Sasame said, yanking her ski mask off. She was younger than I'd thought, not much older than I was. She sounded hopeful. "You have to come home! Orochimaru is <em> destroying us</em> ."</p><p><em> Maybe not then</em> . Awkward family drama but maybe <em> useful</em> awkward family drama. Any group of people that was anti-Orochimaru was worth <em> something</em> surely.</p><p>Arashi sighed, sounding tired and patronising. "Just go home, Sasame. You're just making everything worse. Once Orochimaru-sama sees how strong we are then everything will improve for the Fuma clan, okay? We're <em> so close</em> . I've been given leadership of this base, don't you see? I'm <em> respected</em> . It won't be long now."</p><p>Now <em> that</em> was interesting information to overhear and worth the detour. We hadn't had any serious information on who might be in charge — speculation had pointed to Guren, a woman with a crystalisation blood limit who was on our list of people to avoid — and I gave him a much more serious look. Most notably, he didn't appear to have a curse seal, which was a pretty standard feature for any of Orochimaru's lieutenants.</p><p>Chances were… we'd probably have to fight this guy.</p><p>"And what does it <em> cost</em> ?" Sasame asked, sounding abjectly miserable. "It's not worth it. You haven't seen what he's done to the town. To the <em> country.</em> All the ninja clans are suffering, not just ours. Everything has gotten so much worse since Orochimaru came here and started this stupid village."</p><p>"Does it matter?" Arashi said back. "He's here now and we have to work with that. What do you think you can do about it, Sasame? Kill him?"</p><p>"If I have to," she said, defiantly.</p><p>"You can't even beat <em> me</em> ," he said scornfully. "Do you think you stand a chance against a legendary ninja like that? They say he killed two Kage! Better to be on his good side than be crushed as his enemy."</p><p>"No! You're wrong," she said. "I can't believe you think that!"</p><p>"Things change! Get out of here, Sasame, before someone who <em> will</em> fight you arrives."</p><p>More chakra signatures were starting to converge in the tunnels, so he wasn't that far off. Sasame didn't budge though — maybe she thought he was bluffing, or couldn't tell there were more people coming, which didn't necessarily require sensing as much as… anticipatng that throwing about architectural destruction would invite retaliation. But I thought I saw a flicker of fear across her face when three ninja emerged from the tunnels, arraying themselves behind Arashi.</p><p>"Sasame," said the apparent leader of the new three — a plain looking guy with black hair and a strange double bladed sword on his right arm. "What a reunion."</p><p>"Should have known it was you, causing problems," said the second man — bald with a jagged scar running down over his right eye. "Orochimaru-sama's not pleased that we keep getting attacked, you know. Seems to me like we should… deal with that."</p><p>Sasame glanced at Arashi, and the fear flickered over her face again. She backed up a step.</p><p>"I said you should leave," Arashi said, face falling into a stony, impassive mask. "We must not displease Orochimaru-sama."</p><p>"Then our course is clear," strange-sword-guy said. He leapt past Arashi, sword arm rising and turning and the blades <em> shifted</em> — it wasn't a sword it all, it was some kind of <em> giant scissors</em> and okay, dammit, I knew some ninja specced into weird weaponry but that was kind of stupid — coming down in a attack that Sasame dodged clear of.</p><p>"Kamikiri!" she cried. "You <em> traitor.</em> "</p><p>He scoffed. "You're the traitor, kid. You think attacking Orochimaru-sama's bases was ever going to end well for you?" He attacked again and Sasame blocked it with a kunai, but it still knocked her back a step. He'd overpower her before long.</p><p>Behind Arashi — who didn't appear to be joining the fight, thus depriving me of the chance to gather even more valuable information on him — the bald man crouched down and there was a wave of <em> something</em> on his hands, black and skittering and for a half second I thought he was an Aburame and they were Kikaichu.</p><p>Then I looked closer and saw that they were spiders.</p><p><em> Oh hell no.</em> Kidomaru had been bad enough. I didn't need Spiders Georg Round Two. I couldn't believe the world was unfair enough for that to have been a shared technique, not just his own personal aesthetic.</p><p>God, was there a whole spiders clan?</p><p>I hated it.</p><p>"Bat, we need to <em> go</em> ," Kisuke insisted in my ear. "They can't spot you."</p><p>If Arashi <em> was</em> highly ranked in Hidden Sound to be in charge of a fairly large base — he was probably an opponent that I shouldn't leap into fight for the sake of a complete stranger. Four on one wouldn't be good odds for me, and I was supposed to be abiding by mission stealth. Letting the Sound Ninja know that Konoha ANBU were lurking in the woods would ruin everything.</p><p>By all accounts, I should leave. Sasame would definitely die, but she wasn't my concern — I had no proof that she <em> was</em> anything but another Sound ninja who'd fallen out with the rest.</p><p><em> Who am I kidding?</em></p><p>I slapped a henge quickly over myself. It was plain, like a stock footage girl, but it didn't look like <em> me</em> so that was about all I needed, and anchored it with a quick seal on the back of my white arm guards.</p><p>I didn't habitually use smoke bombs, but they were still part of my Standard ANBU Loadout and Sasame <em> clearly did</em> use them. All I had to do was drop an unnecessary amount of them and set them off in a way that looked like a pre-rigged trap, and viola, the area was flooded with thick, heavy smoke.</p><p>I amped my speed up to maximum and grabbed Sasame in a running leap, hauling her out of the fight and <em> gone,</em> vanishing us both back up into the trees and away, long before the smoke had time to clear.</p><p>None of the Sound ninja followed us, so it seemed like my professional snatch-and-grab had worked. Or maybe they were just too shocked by the unexpected interference to give chase.</p><p>Still — spiders. I stripped chakra over my skin roughly, like the cleaning-off-dust trick <em> just in case</em> and then over Sasame too. Practically. Because they could be used to track us. Not because the thought was making my skin crawl. Obviously.</p><p><em> Sasame </em> seemed pretty shocked. We were nearly far enough away that I would have called us 'safe' before she even started to react — wiggling and squirming.</p><p>"Hey, careful!" I said, landing on the ground and letting her drop gently. "Geeze, that's no way to say thanks, is it?"</p><p>"I—" She stammered, looking really confused. "What— Who are you?"</p><p>"Netsui," I said, quick enough that it totally didn't seem like I'd paused to come up with a fake name. "Are you okay?"</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. "I think so, yes. Oh! I mean, thank you for your help!"</p><p>"You're welcome," I said, full of manners. "So. I heard you wanted to fight Orochimaru?"</p><p><hr /></p><p>It was nearing sundown, as Kisuke pointedly reminded me, but I followed Sasame back to the nearby town even though, you know, secret ANBU mission and I probably shouldn't have. She took a circuitous route though, and most of it by rooftops, so I got the feeling she was trying not to be seen too.</p><p><em> Report in</em> , I signed at Kisuke where she couldn't see.</p><p>"Tenzou isn't going to be pleased," he murmured quietly, possibly in warning, and drifted away.</p><p>That was a problem for later.</p><p>We stopped at a bar that was definitely shadier and grungier than anything I would have set foot in on my own — the banner outside read 'Fuma Lane' so I suspected it was either clan owned or a well-patronised watering hole — and entered via a staff door on the side of the building, keeping to the back rooms and dodging the cooks and waitresses and other staff that were bustling around.</p><p>"Hanzaki," Sasame said quietly, as we approached a cramped office. The man inside was tall and square jawed, with a stern, disapproving face.</p><p>"Sasame," he said and not particularly kindly. "Failed again, I see. And who is this?"</p><p>"Netsui. She saved my life!" Sasame stalked into the office, looking more agitated than she had all the way back, like she was finally allowing herself to show it.</p><p>"It needed saving?" Hanzaki asked, which might have been disapproval or might have been worry. "You need to stop going off on your own."</p><p>"Arashi was there," Sasame said. "He said he was <em> in charge</em> . And everything is still — still like this. His way is never going to work!"</p><p>Hanzaki sighed. "He's been tricked by Orochimaru," he said, and this time it was a little kinder. "Working for approval that's never going to be given. All the members of our clan that he enticed to his side… no matter how strong they get… nothing good will ever come from it."</p><p>"Nothing good will come from staying out of it either!" Sasame burst out. "Your way has only made things worse too!"</p><p>"Is Sasame the only one fighting back?" I asked, disappointed. She'd been outfitted and trained. Even though she'd been alone I had been hoping that there was <em> something </em> of a group behind her.</p><p>At the least I'd wanted to know more about the seals she had used. Barrier seals were <em> my thing.</em></p><p>"It has nothing to do with you, stranger," he pointed out. "You have our thanks, but you can be on your way."</p><p>"I'm after something that's inside the Sound base nearby," I said. That something being 'everything' as per our mission briefing. "If you have a grudge against Orochimaru... if you have information about where the tunnels to his bases are… we might be able to help each other."</p><p>"You're the same as her," Hanzaki said. "Attacking boldly like that won't get you anywhere."</p><p>"Further than you'd think," I said obliquely.</p><p>"She's fast," Sasame said, which was cute. "Maybe <em> I</em> can't get inside, but she might be able to."</p><p>"I'm going to," I corrected. "Either way. The only question is whether you guys want to benefit from it too."</p><p>"You aren't from here, are you?" he asked, after a long moment. He looked at me again, assessing and I knew there was nothing for him to see, but he nodded to himself. "I won't ask where you're from. I know other nations don't care what happens to the likes of us, but none of us are strong enough to fight the likes of Orochimaru."</p><p>I winced. Sure, Konoha had declared Orochimaru a missing nin the instant he'd left but no one had ever lined up to actually <em> deal</em> with him. Not that there were many people who could have. Only the Hokage, who'd been the one to let him go.</p><p>"Fighting Orochimaru is out of my league," I admitted, instead of addressing the <em> which nation are you from</em> issue. "But destroying his stuff? Making life difficult for him? That I can do."</p><p>"That," Hanzaki said, "is <em> exactly</em> what we're doing."</p><p>"We?" I asked. I hoped he meant more than just him and Sasame.</p><p>"The clans in Land of Rice Fields never had a village," Sasame explained, "not like other countries seem to. We all just lived our own lives, you know? We all had different abilities and took different kinds of jobs, so it wasn't like we were fighting each other. But then Orochimaru came and took over everything! A lot of people joined him, but not everyone."</p><p>"The clans are all isolated," Hanzaki said. "But we turned that to work in our favour. We can hit and withdraw, without inviting retaliation. We don't have a lot of resources, but we make the most of what we have."</p><p>Covert tactics. Guerilla warfare. Small, unconnected cells.</p><p>Holy shit, this was the ninja underground resistance.</p><p><hr /></p><p>AN: If anyone is the type to be interested in fic (or art or meta!) gift exchanges, wafflelate is running a <strong> Dreaming of Sunshine Exchange</strong> on AO3.
