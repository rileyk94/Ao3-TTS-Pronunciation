      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred it if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.</p><p><b>Jan 2025</b>: Oh look. An update. I'm posting again!</p></blockquote>

    <p>Chapter Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>While this is a "Hermione is Lily's sister" story, I am attempting to avoid some of the usual cliches found in these stories (all of which were excellent, btw), but 1) removing Hermione as Lily's twin; 2) not inserting Hermione into the lives of familiar characters, until much later; and 3) subverting as many tropes as I can as I go along while shamelessly writing wish-fulfillment.</p><p>As a heads up: while there is <b>torture</b> in a chapter (trigger warning is in the notes before it), I have a thing against putting my characters through too much angst and whump. When still involved in academia, I critically analyze CW shows and since most of them focus on miscommunication, drama for drama's sake - I get tired of it easily. Conflict shouldn't be at the expense of any relationships unless it makes sense for the plot. So go into this story knowing there will be ups and downs, but it's a HEA.</p><p>The story is NOT yet complete - I will remove this note when it is - and is not pre-written. I write for fun when I get the chance around RL responsibilities and adulting, so updates are sporadic. As of April 2022, while there are only two chapters left, I don't have as much time to write as I'd like: I have a full-time 9-to-5 job and have real-life obligations that are getting in the way of computer time. However, these real-life obligations have a deadline, so the goal is to finish the final two chapters between now and October 2022. If you would prefer to come back when the story is done, I look forward to that, then!</p><p>Finally, thank you to all new and returning readers. I never imagined this story would blow up the way it did. As of February 2021, I will have been writing Harry Potter fanfiction for <i>twenty</i> years officially on FFnet, although I was writing fanfic before I knew what fanfic was and when Yahoo!Groups and LiveJournal were still things. I am proud to say I've added something to the Harry Potter fandom, particularly in the James Potter/Hermione ship (apparently known as the SS Then and Now). Even if I don't get to reply to every comment, please know that I do see and read them and love every little gasp, shout, keyboard slam, construct, and gushing you do. ❤️</p></blockquote>

  <strong>September 1975</strong>
</p><p>"Miss Evans, can you stay behind a moment?"</p><p>Hermione sighed, looking longingly down at her gathered up parchment, filled with her neat cursive script, full of ideas and arithmancy equations that she wanted to attempt in the Room of Requirements. She glanced up at the professor - not Professor Vector, as that was the Arithmancy professor in her time, but an old, white-haired hawkish-looking man that was a cross between Einstein's eccentricities and a looming Snape - and then glanced pointedly at her kinetic-wound watch on her left wrist. Arithmancy was, sadly, her last class on Tuesdays, and therefore she did not have an excuse to run away from Professor Pythas.</p><p>Some of the Hufflepuffs - the two in the class - shot her sympathetic looks but the Ravenclaws, her fellow housemates, ignored her. There was a lone Gryffindor Hermione didn't know well, and several Slytherins she was on vaguely friendly terms with. They were all sixth year students, and she was only fourteen. Or so. Age was difficult.</p><p>"Sure, professor," said Hermione instead, turning around with a bright smile on her face. She slid back into her seat.</p><p>The man heaved a sigh as he slid into the spare seat in front of her desk, moving slowly as he bent his knees and his rear rested on the hard wooden surface of the chair. "Ahh," he groaned, reaching behind to rub at his back. "These old bones aren't what they used to be."</p><p>"I'm sure, sir," replied Hermione, politely, if not confused. "But you don't look a day over seventy."</p><p>"Ha!" the man barked, pointing a finger at her. "You're a wonderful student, Miss Evans, but an accomplished liar you are <em>not</em>."</p><p><em>If that's what you think,</em> she thought, darkly, but allowed the same bright smile she presented him with earlier to grace her lips.</p><p>"No, I'm not a day over one hundred and four, but these old bones are <em>tired</em>," the man muttered, "I should really ask Albus for retirement soon…"</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. She did have a library to get to, and a Room of Requirement to spend her afternoon enclosed in, eventually. "Sir, what is this about?"</p><p>Professor Pythas nodded. "Right. Yes. Of course. You see, Miss Evans - Hermione - you really are quite the accomplished student. I wasn't just saying that, dear."</p><p>Hermione nodded. She knew she was an accomplished student, as per his words. That's what happens when you're practically a genius, and already went through Hogwarts once before, even if she did never complete her seventh year or technically graduate. The Ministry still hired her, and she did have the added bonus of being in her forties when she "died."</p><p>"I daresay you're even brighter than your older sister!" the man continued, chortling. "Anyway - myself a few other professors, namely Professor Janulus and Professor Flitwick, think that you're not being challenged enough with the sixth year curriculum in Arithmancy, Runes, and Charms."</p><p>Hermione made a noise.</p><p>"Professor Janulus and I strongly advocated for your skipping ahead to your NEWT year, but Professor Flitwick thinks that self-study might be more in your interest," the man continued, his eyes watching Hermione keenly. "I know that you are quite the raven out of the nest, being the only fourth year in NEWT preparation. But you always had quite the understanding of ancient languages and numbers in ways that I haven't seen in years…"</p><p><em>Benefits of time travel and death, reliving my life, Professor,</em> thought Hermione snarkily, but she shrugged in response to the man's words, instead. "Numbers is just another language, professor. And I like languages."</p><p><em>Also true,</em> thought Hermione, as in her - first? Previous? Other? - life, she had known several languages and added more the longer she worked in the Ministry.</p><p>Professor Pythas reached forward and patted Hermione's hands, neatly laced together and resting on top of the desk. "Oh, I know my dear. But, well, Professor Flitwick is a bit correct that you will probably be happier in self-study until the the end of the year, when I and Professor Janulus and I think you're ready to write your NEWTs. Or, you can wait until next year to do so."</p><p>Two NEWTs before graduating Hogwarts? Hermione's eyebrows went sky-high. <em>That </em>would look quite nice on her resume, and would help her gain a Mastery.</p><p>"That sounds… <em>quite nice</em>, Professor," she finally said, putting enough emphasis on the two words as a form of shock. Sometimes she hated herself for playing her professors, some she knew well - or, used to know. Will know. UGH. - but another part of her took one look at a bunch of rowdy fifth-year Gryffindors and she wanted nothing to do with her (not-)sister's housemates.</p><p>Professor Pythas beamed back at her. "Wonderful, wonderful. I certainly won't mind you continuing to use the class for your own research, as long as you're quiet, which you are, Miss Evans."</p><p>Hermione didn't mind that either. She then smoothly rose from her seat, just as Professor Pythas did as well. The man was already moving to the chalkboard, erasing his equations and prepping for his next class, when Hermione finished placing her papers and textbooks in her bag.</p><p>She was almost at the door when he called her name.</p><p>Hermione turned around.</p><p>"Oh, there's one last thing, Hermione, dear," the man called. "Since you are the best we have, I was wondering if you'd be interested in tutoring a student? He needs some help - his mother is actually quite insistent on it, and she's an old, dear friend - and I thought, 'why! Hermione could do it!'"</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips. <em>Tutor a student? But… my research…!</em></p><p>Something must have shown on her face because the professor shook his head. "Only for an hour or two a week, Miss Evans. Surely you can spare an hour or two?"</p><p><em>When you put it that way…</em> "Sure, professor. Who?"</p><hr /><p>Hermione was viciously stabbing her broccoli when her best friend in this time slid onto the bench in the Great Hall beside her silently, watching with wide brown eyes. His nose twitched and Hermione slanted a glance at him.</p><p>"What?" she growled out.</p><p>"Did the broccoli do something to you?" he asked, reaching forward and spooning other veg from the bowl nearest him before moving to his meats.</p><p>Hermione scowled. "No. I'm just imaging Professor Pythas' face."</p><p>Her friend's eyebrows shot up. "<em>Really</em>? You're practically his darling. I'm sure he actually likes you more than he likes his family. What could he have possibly done to make you that angry?"</p><p>Hermione dropped the fork on her plate with a clatter and ran her hands through her hair, getting her fingers caught in the curls. She yanked them out and then gathered the dark brown curls shot through with red into a ponytail that turned into a lopsided bun.</p><p>"I'm tutoring someone in arithmacy for two hours a week, starting Friday," she muttered.</p><p>"... you've tutored people before," her friend pointed out, frowning. "Why is this a problem <em>now</em>?"</p><p>"It's more of an issue with the <em>who</em>," retorted Hermione.</p><p>"Surely not another Ravenclaw," her friend replied, affronted. "None of them need tutoring, first of all; and second, none would willingly want to be in your company, Hermione."</p><p>The dead-eye stare Hermione gave her friend would have made a lesser man shrink back a bit. "Thanks <em>a lot</em>, Barty."</p><p>Bartemius Crouch Junior shrugged, instead, shoving a piece of cut pork into his mouth. He chewed noisily and then licked his lips with an exaggerated, "<em>yum</em>."</p><p>"No, it's not a Ravenclaw," she answered, glancing around at their housemates. None particularly cared for her - from the moment she stepped into Hogwarts, Lily nattering in her ear about how <em>they were going to have so much fun in Gryffindor!</em> And <em>You'll love it, Hermione, I swear!</em>, Hermione noped out of there as quickly as possible when the Sorting Hat offered Gryffindor.</p><p>She wore red and yellow once. She bled that red, too. Never again.</p><p>The soothing tones of blue and bronze beckoned, and she went to the first House ever offered her at Hogwarts, and joined Ravenclaw. Personally, she thought she dodged a bullet - or bludger, if you wanted wizarding idioms. <em>Especially</em> when she saw the latest prank James Potter and Sirius Black cooked up.</p><p>"Who then? Some dundering Hufflepuff?"</p><p>"What did Hufflepuff ever do to you?" she asked back.</p><p>Together, they glanced over at the Hufflepuff table between them and Gryffindor, and watched as two girls braided another girls' hair at the table, wide smiles on their faces and compliments passing their mouths ever other word.</p><p>Barty turned back to Hermione, the expression on his face saying everything.</p><p>"Yeah, point made," she sighed. "No, not Hufflepuff."</p><p>"And let's be honest, no Slytherin would willingly have a Muggleborn tutor them," sighed Barty, glancing at the Slytherin table, as well as their only other friend, who caught their eyes, frowned, and then pointedly ignored them.</p><p>"Wanker," muttered Barty under his breath.</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "Whatever. Pureblood politics."</p><p>Barty glared at her. "<em>I'm</em> a Pureblood."</p><p>"You make a bad Pureblood," replied Hermione without heat. "You know all the words to Roberta Flack's <em>Killing Me Softly with His Song</em>, and last time you heard the record, you <em>cried</em>."</p><p>"I did not!" hotly retorted Barty. "I mean, I <em>do</em> not. Know the lyrics, that is."</p><p>"Uh huh," replied Hermione.</p><p>"And how did this become about <em>me</em>?" he continued, glaring at her from beneath his brown fringe. "I thought we were trying to figure out the identity of your new tutoree."</p><p>"I know who it is," replied Hermione evenly. "Not you. It's <em>you</em> who is trying to figure it out."</p><p>"Well, when it puts my best friend in such a terrible mood, then, <em>yeah</em>, I want to know who it is," said Barty, all playfulness from his voice gone.</p><p>Hermione marvelled at his mood changes and swings, but knew that they would only get worse as he got older. It was odd seeing the behaviours and habits of her not-Professor-Moody-but-really-Barty-Crouch-the-Death-Eater in her friend.</p><p>"So. Who is it?"</p><p>Hermione sighed, and woefully, she turned her head back towards the Hufflepuff table, and then looked beyond. Looked specifically at a group of four fifth-year boys who were laughing uproariously about something or the other - at her sister, her long shiny red hair cascading down her back with her face matching the colour as she shouted angrily at the four teens.</p><p>Barty's eyes followed hers.</p><p>"Oh. <em>Oh</em>."</p><p>Then:</p><p>"Wait - which one?"</p><p>Hermione's sigh grew heavier. Out of the four boys, she could ignore the sandy blond hair of Remus Lupin, with his silvery scars on his face and general genial personality. He was smart enough to be a Prefect and didn't take Arithmancy. Peter Pettigrew, blonde and short, but lean, was not academic slouch either, but his interests lay in potions, not numbers, and he too, did not take arithmancy.</p><p>Sirius Black and James Potter, on the other hand, both did - but only one had the natural ability to continue doing well in the course while Hermione was sure the other just took it because her sister was taking it as an elective.</p><p>She explained the process of elimination to Barty, who only had two words the sum the entire situation up for her:</p><p>"Well. Fuck."</p><hr /><p>It happened something like this:</p><p>Hermione was forty-seven when some neo-Death Eater group <em>somehow</em> broke into the Ministry one random, rainy Tuesday. Hermione was not supposed to be in work. Hermione was not supposed to let her curiosity get the better of her, and quickly found herself with her best friend, Harry Potter and Head of the Auror Department, back to back, fighting.</p><p>They were in the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>Harry, being Harry, did something stupid.</p><p>His spell mixed with the spell of the neo-Death Eater, and they ricocheted off one another, hitting the wall behind Hermione.</p><p>A wall filled with jars and containers of gaseous clouds or strange swirling liquids of half-forgotten experiments. The jars broke and the contents spilled all over Hermione.</p><p>By the time she figured out what happened, she was two years old, and quickly realizing that she was being weaned off diapers.</p><p>The temper tantrum that followed was still spoken about in the Evans household with hushed, reverent tones.</p><p>It took some time, but Hermione came to the realization that she had somehow been reborn - accidentally or on purpose, who knew - as Hermione Evans. Evans, as in Petunia and Lily. As in, Harry's mother and spiteful aunt.</p><p><em>Potter luck</em>, thought Hermione, darkly. She'd murder Harry once he was actually born. She'd figure out the logistics later.</p><p>In the years that followed, Hermione grew up as Petunia and Lily's younger sister, the youngest child of Leo and Rose Evans and consequently, the babied one. But, Hermione being Hermione, decided quickly that the easiest way she was going to keep her sanity in the coming years was by being precocious (understatement), and set out to master walking and talking, and more importantly, <em>reading</em>.</p><p>(She did, to everyone's amazement.)</p><p>From there, she made lists. Oodles of them. Lists of important events that hadn't happened yet but were politically important; lists of things she would need or wanted as she got older that were unique to her Hermioneness. And then, a List of Important Shit Not to Get Involved In.</p><p>That list consisted of the following:</p><p>- If attending Hogwarts, do not pick Gryffindor</p><p>- If attending Hogwarts, AVOID the following people: Lily Evans, James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Severus Snape…</p><p>- DO NOT CATCH DUMBLEDORE'S ATTENTION</p><p>- Pass your NEWTs. You never did before (#goals)</p><p>Initially, not wanting to be around the familiar faces and names of her future was less to do with disrupting the time/space continuum, if that was even applicable currently, and more about not bursting into tears at the sight of her favourite Professor and his kind words, or hearing the barking laugh that never failed to make her smile or roll her eyes, equally.</p><p>If she caught Dumbledore's attention, she knew she'd be shortlisted for his Order of the Phoenix, and quite frankly, Hermione had enough of fighting. Or at least, fighting <em>his</em> war.</p><p>So, when it came to Hogwarts, Hermione decided her best option was to be quiet, to be plain, and to be invisible. Unfortunately, that lasted all of three seconds until a boy accidentally barrelled into her as they were getting into the boats that took the first years across the lake, and she and the boy she had been behind, were sent tumbling into the icy cold water of the Black Lake.</p><p>Pale faced and blue-lipped, the three of them shivered their way across the Lake as the caretaker, Ogg, couldn't do magic and therefore couldn't warm them up with a charm. They were met in the small alcove below the Great Hall by Professor McGonagall and (a <em>very</em> young) Madam Pomfrey, who fussed over her and the two boys.</p><p>The boy who knocked her over apologized profusely, almost zealously, his face an embarrassed pink. She, she knew, looked like a drowned rat, but took his apologies with kindness. The other boy, with his black hair so dark and shiny when wet it looked blue, refused his apologies.</p><p>"I'd rather be friends with the squid," the black haired boy sniffly said. "I don't care for Ministry brats."</p><p>Hermione gaped at him. The other boy gaped at him. Then, angrily, she snapped - completely forgetting her plan to be invisible - "Well, with that attitude, that's all you'll likely ever have. I'd rather be friends with a Ministry brat than an elitist toerag."</p><p>The brown-haired boy who barrelled into her turned with wide eyes, hero-worship growing. The black-haired boy, did not. "I'm not a toerag! You take that back!"</p><p>"Are too!"</p><p>"Are not!"</p><p>"Are <em>too</em>!"</p><p>"Are <em>not</em>!"</p><p>"What's a toerag?"</p><p>The innocent question from the brown-haired boy stopped Hermione and the other, and somehow - something - struck them as funny because they collapsed into giggles ahead of the Sorting, cementing a friendship.</p><p>"I'm Barty," said the brown-haired boy, shyly. "Barty Crouch, Junior."</p><p>"A <em>Junior</em>?" sneered the black haired boy. "Well, I'm Regulus Black."</p><p>Barty blinked at him innocently. "Don't you mean, Regulus Black the Second?"</p><p>Hermione snorted and introduced herself, "Hermione Gr-<em>Evans</em>. Hermione Evans."</p><p>And neither said anything about her slip. Or her last name. And that was it, at least for friends. Her fellow Ravenclaws hated how smart she was (benefits of doing the curriculum twice over and being, you know, <em>older</em> than them); she doubted the Gryffindors even knew who she was, connected to Lily Evans or not; and the Hufflepuffs were friendly with anyone who smiled at them. The Slytherins were aware of her, but in a vague, <em>oh, Regulus's pet Mudblood</em> way.</p><p>And Hermione liked it like that. She liked having four years of relative peace and quiet for her Hogwarts years. She liked having the Room of Requirements to herself, a place where she could hide away and conduct the same experiments she was working on when she died/not died, and advance magical society decades earlier than she had planned.</p><p>Until now, that was.</p><p>"Well. Fuck." indeed. There went her peace and quiet.</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC...</p>

Maybe it's not a curse. Just depends on how you look at it.</p><p>- <em>Groundhog Day</em> (1993)</p><hr /><p>When anyone asked Leo Evans about his daughters, or Rose Evans, his wife, they would have this to say about them:</p><p>Petunia, their eldest, was as curly-haired and blonde as Leo, but as lithe as her mother. She had green eyes and was a proper little girl, always wearing freshly pressed pinafores and and shiny black Mary Janes. She had proper manners, "yes sir," and "yes, ma'am," and could be as sweet as pie. However, their eldest daughter, burdened with responsibility as the eldest, also had a mean streak as large as the English Channel, and could hold a grudge forever. She might forgive, but she never forgot.</p><p>Lily, their middle child and two years younger than Petunia, was bright and inquisitive. She spoke her mind and had a fiery temper that matched her mother's Irish red hair, green eyes, and thin body. She had the grace of a dancer, the spirit of a fey, and the gumption to back it all up. She was polite, to a point, until she thought someone was stepping on her toes and then she made her opinion known.</p><p>Hermione, however… well… she was a bit odd. Their youngest daughter was a surprise - where Lily was born in January of 1960, Hermione was due for December but was born prematurely on September 19. Their youngest had her father's brown eyes and curly hair, but a shade of dark brown that was streaked with undertones of Rose's red. She too, took after Rose in body shape but whereas Petunia aimed to please, and Lily aimed to change the world, Hermione aimed to do… nothing. Ever since she was a toddler, the child had been grumpy, despondent, or in the throes of grief.</p><p>Leo and Rose had taken her to her pediatrician on a weekly basis and then eventually a child psychologist, who, completely befuddled, had announced that "Hermione seems to be in the middle of the stages of grief," but no one knew why.</p><p>Hermione knew, of course.</p><p>She was a forty-seven year old woman trapped in the body of a two year old. Upon realizing what had happened - although she <em>still</em> wasn't entirely sure, but she blamed Harry and the Potter luck - Hermione railed against being stuck in a toddler's body.</p><p>Well, first she was in denial. She was in her forties! Not <em>two</em>. Surely that miscast spell didn't <em>send her back in time -</em> rather, it killed her. And this was a horrific form of the afterlife.</p><p>Two years of thinking that swiftly turned into anger: anger at Harry, for casting his signature spell in the first place that struck the shelf of artifacts in the Department of Mysteries without thinking of the consequences of spellfire in a dangerous area; anger at Hermione's situation for having to relive childhood; and then anger at realizing it was the bloody <em>1960s</em> and she had her magic and Voldemort was still alive.</p><p>By the time Hermione started nursery, a year after Lily, she was firmly settled into the "bargaining" stage. She prayed to God in church on Sundays at her mother's side; she then prayed to Merlin. Neither heard or answered her prayers, so she got creative: she prayed to Morgana, and Hectate, and then Circe, Isis, Diana, Freyja.</p><p>None answered, and she slid into depression, one so deep she knew her parents worried for her mental state and Lily and Petunia were sometimes near tears trying to cheer their youngest sister up.</p><p>And then, Lily's Hogwarts letter came.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>September 1975</strong>
</p><p>Hermione was impatiently tapping the solid end of her quill against the desk she had claimed as her own back in her first year the first time around, and the one that she used <em>this</em> time around as well. It was a tiny alcove off to the main library area, still visible to some but secluded enough that most didn't infringe on her when she was trying to do work.</p><p>Lily knew where she sat, and given that she sat on the other side of the desk - visible to all who walked into the library and looked around - Hermione knew that James Potter wouldn't be able to miss her.</p><p>Except for the fact that he was already twenty minutes later to their first - and if this kept up, <em>only</em> - tutoring session.</p><p><em>Harry would've shown up on time</em>. Hermione ruthlessly smothered her ire. Did she honestly expect anything different from James Potter? From the four years she had been at Hogwarts in this time, she knew what the teenager was like. And, over the years, when Harry could spare the time to tell her about what he saw in Snape's pensieve, she had a good idea that <em>that</em> was an accurate representation of him. But comparing him - even unfavourably - to Harry would only dredge up memories better left forgotten.</p><p>Instead, she grit her teeth and her hand clenched around her quill, neatly snapping it in two. <em>This is for Harry. For </em>Harry<em>. HAR-REE</em>. <em>Remember, Hermione - for Harry. So you can kill him later.</em></p><p>"Whoa, Evans," a voice said above her, making her jerk her head up in surprise. "Anger issues, much?" He then paused, looked at her, and asked, skeptically, "It <em>is</em> Hermione Evans, right?"</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and counted to ten. In ancient Greek. And then she opened them and impassively surveyed James Potter.</p><p><em>He was mildly attractive,</em> she supposed, wrinkling her nose just a bit, <em>if one ignored his personality or when he opened his mouth</em>.</p><p>He was tall, and broad-shouldered, and he had an easy grin and charm that fell off him. His Gryffindor jumper fit well, and his tie was neatly knotted, and his trousers were pressed perfectly. If it weren't for his black, wind-swept hair, Hermione wouldn't even peg Harry as a relative - they were too different, too fundamentally different.</p><p>Where James held his shoulders back in confidence, Harry had slouched. Where James' hazel eyes gleamed with mischief, Harry's sparkled with danger. The cockiness in James' voice was as different as the wariness in Harry's.</p><p><em>Separating them into two different people is going to be </em>ridiculously <em>easy,</em> thought Hermione, almost in surprise. All she - and Harry, in retrospect - had ever heard was how like his father he was… <em>lies</em>.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm Hermione," said Hermione eventually. She loosened her grip on the two pieces of snapped quill, and glanced at it. Letting the pieces fall from her hand, she then casually waved her palm above it, and nonverbally cast a <em>reparo</em>. Potter's eyes went wide.</p><p>"Whoa," he muttered, his eyes darting from the quill to her. "Wait, you're a <em>fourth</em> year?"</p><p>"Correct," she muttered. "Also: you're late."</p><p>"What? Wait, no -"</p><p>"<em>Wait, no</em>," she mimicked nastily in a slightly higher voice than her normal one. "Actually, yes you are. Our tutoring session was scheduled to begin at four o'clock, <em>sharp</em>. It is now four-thirty, and we are thirty minutes behind. Sit your arse down, open your book, and show me your most recent homework."</p><p>Potter's mouth, which had dropped open when she interrupted him, snapped shut. His eyes blazed in fury, and, although he fell in the seat opposite her, he leaned forward and snarled across the table, "Who the hell are you to talk to me like that?"</p><p>Hermione gazed back at him, nonplussed by the threat in his voice. "I thought we covered that already, or do you have short-term memory problems? That could explain your inability to learn arithmancy. I'm Hermione Evans. Remember? Your arithmancy tutor?"</p><p>He rocked back in his seat, staring at her.</p><p>She waited patiently, almost as though she could hear the rusty cogs in his brain going <em>tick-tick-tick</em>. "You're nothing like your sister."</p><p>"Yep," replied Hermione with forced, false cheerfulness. "Now. Arithmancy. Let's get this over with so I can tell Pythas that I <em>tried</em>, but you weren't interested and we can both end this sham of a wasted Friday night. I'm sure you have better things to do, because I sure as hell do."</p><p>There was something odd in Potter's eyes that Hermione couldn't read - another difference to Harry; her best friend had been an open book - but the fifth year Gryffindor yanked his battered arithmancy text from his bag, slammed it on the table. Inside the front cover were several hastily shoved in loose parchment, which Hermione discovered was his homework for the past three weeks of September, covered in the red ink Pythas favoured for marking things incorrectly.</p><p>She grimaced and carefully pinched one piece of parchment between two fingers, edging it towards her like it was the skinny version of the Monster Book of Monsters. Her nose wrinkled. "Is that - is that <em>pumpkin juice</em> on your homework?"</p><p>Potter rocked the chair back on its two legs and crossed his arms as he gazed at her from behind his glasses. "Yep."</p><p>"Did you - did you spill it <em>before</em> or <em>after</em> you did your homework?" she looked sick just thinking about the runny ink on the page, and what potential answer Potter would give her.</p><p>There was something devilish in his eyes and his smile when he purred out, "<em>Before</em>."</p><p>Hermione whimpered.</p><hr /><p>Hermione entered the Ravenclaw Common Room ten minutes to curfew - which was normal for her, any day of the week. Barty, as usual, was waiting for her on the couch facing the door. He didn't look up as he called, "So, how was it? Did you make Potter beg for your help?"</p><p>When she didn't reply, he looked up and then nearly flew off the couch.</p><p>"Merlin, Hermione!" She stood just inside the door, pale and wide-eyed. It was almost like she was shell shocked. Barty frantically raced over and, forgetting he was a wizard, began to run his hands up and down her arms, shoulders, neck.</p><p>"Were you pranked? Did they prank you? Are you hurt?"</p><p>His questions came fast and furious, but it wasn't until one of his hands grazed her breast that she snapped out of it and began slapping his hands away.</p><p>"Well, excuse me," he said sniffly, stepping back.</p><p>Hermione wearily trudged over to the couch Barty vacated and fell heavily into the plush blue fabric.</p><p>Sighing, Barty followed and then sat next to her. "That bad?"</p><p>"I - I honestly don't know," replied Hermione, eventually, still wide-eyed. "He was late. By thirty minutes. His homework is - is <em>atrocious</em>. I don't even think he knows what he's supposed to be <em>doing</em>." She shook her head. "I don't even know how he passed his fourth year."</p><p>Barty was silent, so Hermione glanced over at him and saw he was nervously licking his lips - the very same bad habit that outed him to his father once upon a future time.</p><p>"What?" she asked.</p><p>"Are you still going to tutor him?" he eventually asked.</p><p>Hermione half-shook her head, then nodded, and then settled on a shrug. "I don't think so," she finally said, chewing on her bottom lip. "He didn't seem that interested in learning anyway - he kept asking me about my sister. I think after tonight he'll forget all about me."</p><p>Barty looked skeptical, but they parted ways for their separate beds and Hermione, firmly, repeated to herself before falling asleep: <em>James Potter won't even remember me. See? Everything is fine. Everything will be fine</em>.</p><hr /><p>Elsewhere, James Potter returned to the Gryffindor Common Room. Sirius Black, his best friend, looked up from here he was sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace, playing Exploding Snap with Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. It was late, it was dark, and James hastily stuffed his invisibility cloak in his bag.</p><p>"Well, mate?" asked Sirius. "How was it? Who's the 'Claw tutoring you?"</p><p>James fell into a vacant armchair and grinned. "Hermione Evans."</p><p>"<em>Evans</em>?" repeated Sirius, gapping.</p><p>Remus frowned. "Lily's younger sister?"</p><p>James whipped his head around to face his friend. "You <em>knew</em> she has a sister?"</p><p>Remus stared at him. "<em>You</em> didn't?"</p><p>Sirius snorted a laugh loudly, thinking it hilarious that Remus knew something about his precious "Lily-flower" that he didn't know.</p><p>James flushed and pulled at his collar. "Yes, well -"</p><p>"Whatever," dismissed Sirius, turning back to his cards, "Now that Jimmy did his duty, we can get our Friday nights back and he won't be going to these stupid tutoring sessions anymore." There was silence, so Sirius slowly raised his head and looked at James. "<em>Right?</em>"</p><p>James shrugged. "I thought I could ask her more about her sister, you know?"</p><p>Remus shot him a disapproving look, and Peter asked, quietly, "You're going to ask Lily's sister about Lily… so you... know more about Lily?"</p><p>James nodded emphatically.</p><p>Remus groaned.</p><p>Sirius was caught between grinning at the great idea and frowning at the loss of his friend. "Well…"</p><p>"Also," continued James, "She's <em>hilarious</em> to wind up. Angrier than a wet nundu. It'll be great. After all, what harm can a puny little fourth year do?"</p><hr /><p>On weekends, Hermione disappeared from Ravenclaw and Hogwarts life completely. The first few months in her first year, Barty - who trailed after her like some silent, puppyish Neville Longbottom - attempted to follow but Hermione knew the passageways in and out of Hogwarts, and had access to the Room of Requirements. It was easy to give him the slip.</p><p>Then, of course, once Barty had told Regulus what was going on, the sneaky Slytherin tagged her with a locator charm and the two cornered her when she returned to the Great Hall for dinner Sunday evening.</p><p><em>Busted</em>, their collectively disapproving eleven-year-old eyes seemed to say.</p><p>In hindsight, Hermione's plans were tossed out of the window the moment Barty bumped into her. There was no way they were going to let her disappear - a Muggleborn who was more secretive than the sneakiest of Slytherins? More knowledgeable on material than any Ravenclaw? She was walking catnip to both of them: Regulus who was <em>interested</em> in her and her secrets, and Barty, who was <em>curious</em> about her abilities. (Regretfully, Hermione wondered if maybe being a swotty know-it-all would've been a better cover than silent-but-deadly-smart-nobody. Ah well, too late to change now.)</p><p>Hermione didn't give up all her secrets, but she knew of an abandoned set of rooms underneath a staircase by the dungeons that she had… "claimed" when she (returned?) first arrived at Hogwarts. She was using it to conduct her experiments.</p><p>First year, it was going through her textbooks nonverbally. While she could do most of those spells as an <em>adult</em>, she was no longer in her forties. She no longer had settled magic, or a fully-grown body. She had to <em>relearn</em> things, like her magical muscle memory. Barty and Regulus joined, because she was well-read and her explanations - honed over years of dumbing things down for Harry, Ron, and Neville - meant that she could explain the theory-heavy texts behind things in ways that were easier to grasp.</p><p>Of course, these were Pureblood boys from houses that already taught them these spells, so they knew the material - but Hermione was an <em>inventor</em>. She made <em>changes</em>. Not to potions - like Snape - or even to the actual material in the way that he did, writing in his textbooks and the like. No, Hermione took the spells, the results, and wondered <em>what if</em>?</p><p>Once upon a time, she was content to leave things as they were - 'if it's not broke, don't fix it' was practically thirteen-year-old Hermione's motto - but in the Ministry, Hermione discovered tiny variations of spells and their histories that were kept separate from the general public. Saw what variations could do in the field when Harry and Ron would return from an Auror mission with new cuts and scars. And she wondered - <em>what if I changed something too?</em></p><p>In the future - her past or present, whatever - Hermione was working on transmutations. She was brilliant at transfiguration, always picking up McGonagall's spells first in the class. She wasn't quite the prodigy, because she <em>analyzed</em> things too much, but her love for her favourite class at Hogwarts, Arithmancy, meant that she could combine the two into transmutation - something never really covered academically.</p><p>Transfiguration was the change in something's appearance or form; transmutation was the subatomic change of one item into another form completely. The Philosopher's Stone was a transmutation, of sorts. Its alchemical properties followed for coal to become gold; for someone mortal to become <em>im</em>mortal by changing their cellular structure.</p><p>Hermione didn't want to create a Philosopher's Stone. Immortality was <em>boring</em>. She wanted to be challenged - she wanted to transmute things that would hold weight, relevance, that would stay and not fade after the transfiguration wore off or was forced back to its original appearance.</p><p>Hence, combining the arithmetic structure of spells with transfiguration. It was a work in progress, but she was getting there. Sort of.</p><p>Barty and Regulus benefitted from Hermione's research, as their own academic interests began to branch out and vary into fields most ignored. Unfortunately, Hermione was certain that their abilities and interest in transmutation and more esoteric magic meant they were shiny baubles Voldemort was going to want, but… well… she'd get to that eventually.</p><p>Instead, they plied her and her research with books from their libraries, carefully snuck out over holidays, and she - well, she educated them by taking them into Muggle London, showing the the things science could do. It might not have been, but it was a kind of magic.</p><p>Their friendship worked.</p><p>That weekend, following her first (and hopefully, <em>only</em>) tutoring session with James Potter, saw Hermione in that appropriated classroom, dutifully copying out a hand-drawn transmutation circle in her notebook with chalk on the classroom floor. In the center of the circle was a dead flower, picked by Regulus to give to Calypso Fawcett for the upcoming Hogsmeade weekend. When she turned him down, Hermione took the flower.</p><p>(Waste not.)</p><p>Regulus leaned against a desk that they had pushed up against a far wall, arms and legs crossed. Barty was seated cross-legged on top, next to him. Both were eyeing Hermione.</p><p>"Are you sure this is going to work?" drawled Regulus.</p><p>Hermione glanced over her shoulder at him, a glare to her brown eyes. Luckily, <em>those</em> hadn't changed. She snapped her notebook, held open in one hand, shut with a loud <em>snap</em>. "Yes," she replied snippily.</p><p>"Only," continued Regulus, "You said it would work the last time, and it didn't."</p><p>"And the one before that," added Barty helpfully. He had a sugar quill sticking out of the corner of his mouth, sucking on it hard.</p><p>"I made some adjustments on my calculations," replied Hermione hotly.</p><p>"Uh huh," said Regulus.</p><p>Hermione squared her shoulders and planted her hands on her hips. "No one <em>asked</em> you to be here, Black." She made a waving motion with her hand. "Shoo. Begone."</p><p>"Nah," he said, leaning further back. "I'm looking forward to seeing you fail again."</p><p>"It's not <em>failure</em>," snarled Hermione, "It's a <em>learning experience</em>."</p><p>Barty didn't even try stifling his snickers.</p><p>Grumbling to herself, Hermione turned her back on her two friends. She carefully looked over the chalk circle on the floor. It was small, no longer than a dinner plate. The flower was on the inside of the circle, and there was another circle outside it, with a square between the two layers. In the gaps between the outer circle and the square were numerology markings - equations and symbols of power - that provided the basic molecular structure of the flower and its components.</p><p>She took a deep breath, and knelt in front of the transmutation circle. She used to be able to do tiny little parlour tricks like bringing flowers and small insects back to life when she was older, but she never got further in her research for more. This test - her sixth that first month back at Hogwarts - would determine if her magic was finally starting to settle.</p><p>From her understanding, most transmutation circles required to be planned out in advance. Hermione wanted to understand the <em>theory</em> behind it first and then - ideally - once she had that down, she could all on transmutation circles without pre-planning or marking them out in chalk. But that would come later.</p><p>Clapping her hands together until her palms touched, Hermione centered herself - pushing her annoyance at her friends away, at James Potter and tutoring him, pushing away her fears of failing again - and then slammed her hands flat on either side of the circle.</p><p>Her eyes opened and blazed with power.</p><p>The circle glowed white, and the wilted flower in the middle of the circle reversed from brown, brittle petals to blushing pink; its dull, grey stem turned healthy green and the sickly, cloying scent of rotting plants was replaced with the fresh scent of roses.</p><p><em>It worked</em>, she thought breathlessly.</p><p>"Sweet Merlin!" gasped Barty, pushing up off the desk and kneeling next to her. Regulus carefully approached and, at her nod, reached into the circle and plucked the freshly-plucked flower from within, holding it and twirling it between his fingers.</p><p>He eyed it curiously for several moments, and then, turned to Hermione. He gave the most beautiful and sincere smile she had ever seen on him, and said, "Congratulations, Hermione."</p><p>"You know what this means, don't you?" said an eager Barty.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "No, what?"</p><p>"You're going to change the world," he replied, beaming at her. She was painfully aware that once, he wore a similar expression when talking about his devotion to the Dark Lord. "And we're going to be right beside you."</p><p>Swallowing thickly, and pushing past the dangers that her memories were flinging at her, Hermione grinned. "Well, that's only if Potter doesn't want me tutoring anymore. Because I'm pretty sure if we have another tutoring session, it might just kill me."</p><p>"From what you said," began Regulus, standing up, still holding the flower. "It'll be unlikely."</p><p>"Well, he <em>is</em> a glutton for punishment," argued Barty, as Hermione brought her wand out and cast <em>scourgify</em> to erase the chalk. "After all, he's only confessed his love to Hermione's sister how many times now?"</p><p>With the chalk vanished, Hermione sat back on her heels and wiped her hands on her skirt. Regulus made a face at the action, but Hermione ignored it and said, "Well… in that case, he might want to take the punishment of dealing with me. But I'm not Lily - it'll be a waste of time. Honestly, he should just <em>ask her</em> for help."</p><p>"He wouldn't be able to get through a full sentence without an 'I love you,' somewhere," laughed Barty.</p><p>Hermione's lips twitched. "Too right."</p><p>Standing, she collected her book bag and joined the other two, leaving the classroom. Transmutation always made her hungry. "Kitchens?"</p><p>"Sure," agreed Barty happily for them both. He bounced beside her with nervous, vibrant energy. "Say, do you think you can show me your notes? I want to give that a try."</p><p>"No," replied Hermione at once, thinking of the incredibly damage Barty could potentially cause with knowledge of transmutation circles. She amended herself when she saw the crestfallen look on his face, "Not until you have your nonverbal spells down."</p><p>He pouted but nodded.</p><p>Regulus, on Hermione's other side, was strolling along with a hand in his pocket and the other, thoughtfully twirling the flower around and around. "Do you think I could try again with Calypso?"</p><p>"Not with the same flower," replied Hermione, "It would look tacky."</p><p>Regulus scoffed. "She'd never know."</p><p>The look Hermione sent back was scathing. "<em>Of course</em> women will know-"</p><p>A large curtain of icy water crashed over Hermione, raining heavily down on her from above, in the middle of a nondescript hallway. Regulus and Barty immediately leaped sideways to avoid the water, and had cast an umbrella charm to keep the water from splashing up on them. Hermione, however, was <em>drenched</em>.</p><p>She stood shock still, her shoulders up and her arms held away from her body, like a frozen statue as her brown hair heavily hung forward and her soaked Ravenclaw jumper and skirt clung to her body and thighs.</p><p>There was loud laughter in front of her, and she shakily pushed her lanky wet hair out from her eyes to stare at James and Sirius, who were supporting each other as they laughed, so hard they were nearly on the floor.</p><p>"L-Like I s-said, P-Padfoot!" hiccuped James, wheezing. "W-W-Wet nundu!"</p><p>Fourteen year old Hermione Evans felt like crying, standing there soaked while Barty began shouting something at the two in her defense and Regulus silently began casting warming charms - although that was going to fluff her hair up something terrible.</p><p>Four years. She had lasted four years without James Potter knowing who she was, without becoming a victim of his pranks. She wasn't even a blip on the Marauders radar.</p><p>Her impressive mind began to race. She had to fix this. And soon. Everything relied on her being invisible and unimportant. People took notice of who James Potter pranked. Whom he spoke to.</p><p>This wouldn't do.</p><p>At all.</p><hr /><p align="center"><strong>TBC...</strong> </p>

  <p align="center">Yesterday is Today (everything is connected)</p><p align="center">THREE</p><hr /><p><strong>Dirk:</strong> You've been making choices out of desperation for too long. Take control of your life, Todd. The minute you do, interesting things will happen.<br />- Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, "Horizons," 1x01 (2016)</p><hr /><p>Petunia spent all summer talking up Cokeworth Secondary, telling Lily how excited she was that the two Evans sisters would finally be at the same school again, and how when Hermione joined in a few short years, they would rule the school. Petunia had a grand idea of using her gossiping skills and charm to sweet-talk the staff; Lily's temper and idealism would detract any naysayers to the Evanses plans; and Hermione's shrewd attitude and manipulations would ensure those that <em>did</em> protest against the girls would come to swift, school-level ends.</p><p>It would be <em>glorious</em>, was Petunia's thoughts, her eyes star-riddled.</p><p>Then Lily's Hogwarts letter arrived.</p><p>And things were never quite the same, again.</p><hr /><p>In Petunia's mind - what Lily could do was… interesting. There was a potential there, for other… <em>stuff</em>. She supposed, anyway (she wasn't fully sold on the 'magic' thing of it, truthfully. It was all so… flamboyant. Not refined, not at all). Petunia didn't so much mind magic the way she minded Severus Snape.</p><p>The strange, long-haired boy from Spinner's End, with his used clothing and dismissive attitude against her (<em>her!</em> Petunia seethed), solidified her dislike. Then he went and told Lily she could and should perform magic out in <em>public</em>? <em>Who does that</em>?</p><p>Lily was enchanted, the idiot. Someone just like her!</p><p><em>Hermione could do magic, too</em>, Petunia thought, although unlike Lily who thought it was neat to animate flowers, Hermione kept her magic - or superhero abilities, again, Petunia wasn't sold on the idea - to a strict minimum of <em>usefulness</em>. Like, cleaning their rooms. And putting the dishes away. And hiding the evidence of them gorging on junk food before dinner when their parents went out shopping, only to innocently say, in a very clean living room, "No, Mum, Da, we didn't even <em>think</em> about opening the snack drawer!"</p><p>Petunia didn't like the idea of Lily going away - they were supposed to <em>stick together</em>! Go to the same school, meet boys, fall in love, get married and live near each other and start having kids at the same time so they grew up together. Petunia had it all planned out; and now Lily had to go and deviate from that plan? And if <em>she</em> got an invite to that Hogwarts school, so would Hermione.</p><p>Where did that leave her?</p><p>Alone, that's where.</p><p>So she wrote the Headmaster, Dumbledore, and asked to attend.</p><p>That stupid Snape boy - and <em>Lily</em> - how <em>could she?</em> - snuck into her room and read the man's reply, telling her that Hogwarts was for magicals, not <em>muggles</em> like her.</p><p>The rift that began to grow. It splintered on September first when Petunia and Hermione said goodbye to Lily in London; the young girl couldn't stop saying "Severus told me" and "Severus said that". When did that odious boy take Petunia's place as trusted, reliable, informative older sister? When had he stolen her best friend from her?</p><p>"You're a freak," slipped out that morning, in front of a solid, stone column at King's Cross.</p><p>Hurt blossomed in Lily's green eyes, and she protested, "I'm not a freak. That's a horrible thing to say!"</p><p>Even Hermione, standing at Petunia's side while their parents conversed a short distance away to give the girls' some last time together, turned judgmental eyes on her.</p><p>Hurt blossomed in Petunia, too, though, and she snapped, "But that's where you're going. A special school for freaks."</p><p>Their relationship - the one that had once been so close between the three sisters - splintered. It would never heal.</p><hr /><p><strong>September</strong> <strong>1975</strong></p><p><em>Four years</em>, seethed Hermione, stabbing her roast beef with her fork. <em>Four years I managed to keep away from the Marauders, minding my own business as the timeline managed itself</em>.</p><p>At her side, Barty had bypassed dinner entirely and was scouring the table for desserts - particularly sugary tarts, which were by far Hermione's favourite - and shoving them at her. The tart plates kept hitting and butting up against her dinner plate, but Hermione was so cheerfully stuck in her own head, she barely noticed. (Or it was likely she didn't see - once the drying charm was cast, her hair fluffed up, and resembled a poodle. It wasn't attractive, but it did mean that she had a wickedly fashionable perm for the 70s.)</p><p>"Honestly, who does he think he is?" Barty muttered lowly at her side, the other Ravenclaws giving them a very wide berth. "Merlin - I swear - the next time he even <em>thinks</em> about pointing his wand for a prank at you, I'm gonna… I'm gonna… scour his mouth out with a cleaning charm!"</p><p>"What a wonderful idea, Crouch," praised a feminine voice as the empty space on bench next to Hermione was taken by a familiar Gryffindor uniform. "I think I'll use that on Potter, myself."</p><p>Hermione glanced up and said, pointedly, "I'm over it," meeting her sister's vibrant emerald eyes.</p><p>"I'm not," retorted Lily, her Midlands accent flattening in her annoyance, as she held Hermione's brown eyes.</p><p>Hermione sighed. "It's not worth it, Lily. He pranks a lot of people."</p><p>"'A lot of people' aren't my sister," replied the redhead, and a staring match commenced.</p><p>Barty, bored now, began eating one of Hermione's tarts.</p><p>"Why did he even target you?" asked Lily finally, glancing away and absently looking across the hall and over the Hufflepuff table back towards Gryffindor. There, at the table, James Potter was valiantly trying to look cool although his eyes kept darting over to her, seated at the Ravenclaw table. His friends were trying to distract him, but it was obvious he was curious about her change of dinner seat.</p><p>Hermione shrugged.</p><p>Barty snorted, so Lily turned to him, causing Hermione to sigh. Lily and Barty did not get along. Regulus couldn't stand her, but his Slytherin friendship with Snape meant that he tolerated Lily for the older Slytherin's sake (which Hermione saw ending shortly, once this year was done). Barty, however, found Lily particularly idealistic which grated on him; Lily, in return, found Barty a bit too… maniacal for her tastes (Hermione had to admit that Barty did come off a bit strong).</p><p>Overall, Lily didn't like Hermione's friends, and Hermione didn't like hers. Sort of, anyway - Hermione preferred to be far, far away from Lily's friends - beyond Snape, that included Marlene McKinnon and Mary MacDonald in Gryffindor with her.</p><p>So when Lily and Barty began to politely speak, Hermione quickly looked up at the enchanted ceiling in the Great Hall to see if the world was ending in fire and brimstone.</p><p>"Hermione's tutoring him in Arithmancy," answered Barty, absently licking flaky pastry stuck to his finger.</p><p>"How's that a cause for a prank?" asked Lily, in confusion. She turned back to her sister. "He's never targeted you before. I would've noticed."</p><p>Hermione shifted uneasily on the bench. "I may have… erm… been a bit rude."</p><p>Barty snorted again and Hermione shot him a nasty look, wondering, <em>maybe a trip to Madam Pomfrey to clear your sinuses is imminent, my friend…</em></p><p>"Rude?" Lily's eyes were wide. "<em>You?</em> Hermy, love, you're a sweetheart."</p><p>Hermione blanched and neatly sidestepped the point Lily was making. "God, don't call me that, Lily. Ugh. That's worse than Mia, honestly. I have a perfectly good name, can we just use that?"</p><p>"Hermy!" chortled Barty beside her.</p><p>Scowling, Hermione elbowed him painfully in the side and he wheezed painfully, leaning over the table and placing his head onto a free spot of wood. "Bad Barty. <em>No.</em>"</p><p>Lily's face was a picture of innocence. "I don't know what you're talking about, 'Mione." The redhead shook her head. "Anyway - so you were a bit rude during a tutoring session. It's Potter - I lose my temper on him on a regular basis. He doesn't prank <em>me</em>."</p><p>Hermione and Barty stared at Lily, until she blushed, the flush in her cheeks painfully clashing with her hair. She then looked away, fiddling with a loose thread on her Gryffindor jumper. "Ah, yes - erm, right. Never mind."</p><p>"At least you're aware," muttered Hermione under her breath. She cleared her throat and spoke louder. "Look, Lily - honestly? It's fine. It was a stupid prank but it meant nothing. I'm not going to tutor Potter anymore in Arithmancy; I only did it because Pythas asked me to, and now I can honestly go back and say that we won't work well together."</p><p>"Is he going to penalize you, though?" asked Lily with wide eyes. The thought of not obeying a professor was rancid to her, and her palms began to sweat with nerves.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "Penalize me against taking my NEWT in Arithmancy and Ancient Runes next year? Please. It doesn't just look good on my transcripts, you know - it makes Pythas and Janulus look great as educators. They won't take that away."</p><p>"Well. If you say so."</p><p>"I do," replied Hermione evenly, much of her temper cooled. Being on Potter's radar was definitely not good - because if <em>he</em> noticed her, so did Sirius, Remus, and Peter - and it meant that Hermione's plan of being rather invisible from those she knew Before was in jeopardy. She didn't want Dumbledore looking too closely at her; she didn't want to be brought in to her sister's circle. Hermione was quite happy where she was, thank you very much.</p><p>(And if she conveniently had no idea where she was, and where she was going - well, she could lie to herself, too.)</p><p>Lily hummed noncommittally, playing with a fork on the table. "Alright then. Anyway - I got a letter from Mum and Da, and they mentioned you hadn't written. So. Write them. Or something - you've always been kind of bad about that. I'm sending a letter tomorrow night, if you want to send something along with Jackie O."</p><p>Hermione shook her head at the stupid name Lily gave her owl -- whose ruffled head feathers made it look like it was wearing a fashionable Jackie O Kennedy cap -- when their parents finally allowed her a pet. "You and your owl, I swear. Yeah, I'll have something. Thanks for stopping by, Lils."</p><p>Lily grinned widely at the use of the childhood nickname that Hermione and Petunia used for her, and leaned over to tightly hug her sister, who predictably whined and squirmed. "Love you," Lily murmured against Hermione's poofy dark auburn curls.</p><p>Hermione sighed, stilled, and whispered, "Love you, too," back to her sister, who radiated contentment.</p><p>Lily then let go and wriggled her fingers in a goodbye wave, nodding her goodbye to Barty, who stared at her while stuffing his mouth with another pastry; she then walked around the Hufflepuff table to sit with her friends at Gryffindor, completely ignoring Potter who leaned across the table, running a hand through his hair and make it more windswept as he tried to speak with her.</p><p>And, by the time dinner was over, Lily had scoured Potter's mouth with a cleaning charm.</p><p>It made Hermione's night.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>October 1975</strong>
</p><p>Barty was never going to understand transmutation, Hermione decided closer to Halloween, as she watched him attempt to cast nonverbally, his face growing red in frustration.</p><p>They were in her practice classroom, with Hermione taking a break from her transmutation circles to help her best friend work his way through the first year curriculum nonverbally. Regulus was at Quidditch practice, leaving Hermione to give Barty her undivided attention - which he liked.</p><p>But his feather failed to float off the desk in front of him.</p><p>He let out an explosive shout and flung his wand from his hand. It hit the far wall and then skittered back across the flagstone floor where it rolled to a rest. Hermione watched silently.</p><p>"I'm never going to get it!" snapped Barty, breathing heavily.</p><p>Hermione, arms crossed, shook her head. "Not with that attitude," she replied, her voice soft. Getting angry at Barty or calling him out often led to his magic snapping back - it made him feel like he was at home.</p><p>"Just because you're a magical prodigy doesn't mean the rest of us are!" snapped Barty, whirling around to face his friend. "Just admit I'm useless, will you?"</p><p>Hermione dropped her arms. "You're <em>not</em> useless. At all. And I don't want to hear you call yourself that ever again. I'm just lucky that I <em>get</em> magic, Barty. That's why I can cast nonverbally." <em>And because I'm damn old compared to everyone else here, and went through this already, but… well… I'm not going to tell anyone that</em>.</p><p>"Then why aren't I getting it, Hermione?" he whined, staring at the floor. "It's a stupid <em>wingardium leviosa</em>."</p><p>Hermione stepped forward and, coming to Barty's side, gave him an awkwardly-angled hug. His tense frame softened and he reached up to lay a hand overtop her arm, stretched across his chest. "Remember that feeling when you said the spell back in first year? How you visualized the feather floating? The magic inside you swirling about and eager to do what you wanted?"</p><p>Barty breathed deeply. The fourteen year old, all gangly arms and legs, nodded and let go of Hermione's arm with his right hand to summon his wand back - that, he could do. His wand slapped into his waiting palm, and with Hermione still attached to his side, he felt himself calm.</p><p>"I'll try," he muttered.</p><p>Hermione chuckled into his shoulder - where she barely reached. "Do or do not, Barty - there is no try."</p><p>He frowned. "Really? That's terrible advice. Else your own 'learning experiences' would be classed as 'do nots.'"</p><p>"Shut up, I never said it was a perfect quote," replied Hermione, grinning into the shoulder. <em>Sorry, Yoda. We're a few years too early and already you're being taken to task.</em></p><p>"Whatever," muttered Barty, and then, with his eyes closed, he pointed his wand at the feather, and let his wrist roll in the familiar motion as he thought, <em>wingardium leviosa</em>. He felt his magic swirl down his arm and into his wand, and in his mind he saw exactly what he wanted: his feather floating gently up and hovering in the air in front of him.</p><p>"Open your eyes, Barty."</p><p>He did, and there, exactly how he imagined it, was his feather floating. He turned and grinned at Hermione, who beamed back up at him.</p><p>He let the magic dissipate, and swept his friend into a hug, swinging her around in his glee. <em>He did it!</em> He thought, a grin stretching across his face. <em>Because Hermione believed in him!</em></p><p>"One spell down, about three hundred to go!" he crowed.</p><p>Hermione laughed.</p><p>Later, when they took a break, Barty turned to her and asked, "Be honest. Do you think I'll ever be able to do transmutations like you?"</p><p>Hermione frowned, looking down at her hands. She sat on top of the desk Barty had used when she cracked her transmutation circle, her legs swinging off and heels hitting the wooden frame, while Barty sat next to her, cross-legged.</p><p>"Probably not," she admitted. "Your moods jump too much. Transmutation needs to be carefully thought out in the moment of preparation and casting. You're brilliant, Barty, and can understand the theory, but the practice might be too much for you. However - nonverbal casting as a fourth year when we only learn about it in sixth? That's definitely going to be your strength."</p><p>Barty ducked his head shyly, preening under the compliment even if she was being realistic.</p><p>They sat together a bit longer, before Hermione sighed and slipped off the desk. "Anyway, I was going to go to the library."</p><p>Barty nodded. "I'll see you back in the common room. Don't be out too late."</p><p>"Worried I'll cost us points?" she grinned, bending to scoop up her school bag and loop it over her shoulder.</p><p>"No," said Barty, rolling his eyes, unfolding his legs and standing as well. "I know you don't get caught. I just mean with Potter and his friends out roaming. Be careful."</p><p>Hermione nodded, said her goodbyes, and headed for the library. She wanted some time to go over her transmutation notes and maybe check out a book or two. Upon reaching the library, she dumped her bag on her usual seat, the tiny alcove hidden nook she claimed as hers, and then went in search for her books. Both were Alchemical in nature, one written by Flamel himself, but Hermione wasn't too interested in the <em>content</em> - she was interested in what wasn't said.</p><p>Her transmutation circles were coming quicker - it wasn't difficult for her to plan the circles out in advance anymore - but rather, the difficulty lay in the objects she wanted to transmute. She needed to understand their molecular structure, and she wanted to know <em>why</em> when such a thing like magic existed.</p><p>She was halfway through taking notes on one book when a body slammed into the chair opposite her. She startled, and her eyes darted up, even as a line of smeared ink went across her page.</p><p>"<em>Potter?"</em></p><p>James Potter stared back, his lips pressed in a thin line across his face. There was something hard in the fifteen-year-old's expression that Hermione hadn't quite expected to see; and worse, it reminded her of a very serious Harry, about to say something she wouldn't be excited to hear, at all. It reminded her of the night of their OWLs, when he was sure Sirius was being tortured by Voldemort.</p><p>"Evans," the teen replied, his voice flat.</p><p>Hermione made a show of looking around the library in confusion. "There are other free tables, Potter. What are you doing at mine?"</p><p>James carefully folded his hands on top of the desk, but she could see that his wand was out and resting along the woodgrain. He then leaned forward, just the tiniest bit, and his nose twitched - once. There was a struggle, and eventually he said, through gritted teeth, "We had an Arithmancy test just this week. I got it back today."</p><p>Hermione felt wariness creep up her spine. She leaned back a bit in her seat. "Oh?"</p><p>He nodded, misery etched into his face for a moment. "I failed the test. And Pythas owled my mother my results. She sent a Howler to me this morning."</p><p>Hermione thought back to breakfast - she had heard of some commotion over at the Gryffindor table, but in all honesty, she was too busy rereading her notes and doing some light reading in an advanced Ancient Runes book she coerced - erm, <em>nicely asked</em> - Professor Janulus to lend her. She hadn't been paying attention.</p><p>"What does this have to do with me?" Hermione asked pointedly.</p><p>The black-haired teen sighed heavily and then reached up with his wand-free hand, and ran it through his hair. Hermione tensed. "I may have told my mum that I was still taking tutoring sessions and she learned I lied about it."</p><p>Hermione's eyes narrowed into slits. "<em>Annnnnd</em>?"</p><p>James squirmed in his seat. "Annnnd," he mimicked the drawn-out word, although with much less hostility that she emphasized, "I would really like to take up our tutoring sessions, again."</p><p>When that failed to move her, he gave a small, wobbly smile. "Honestly. I swear. Marauder's honour."</p><p>Hermione snorted. <em>Marauder's honour, my arse. There's a reason why "I solemnly swear I'm up to no good," was their password</em>. <em>Still…</em></p><p>"Every Friday, seven on the dot," said Hermione suddenly, startling James Potter. "And you need to come prepared - like, read the chapter ahead, sort of thing. <em>And</em>," she emphasized, "<em>No</em> asking about my sister. These two hours are for your academics and school alone."</p><p>James narrowed his eyes back. "So you're saying that outside of the two hours I can ask about Lily?"</p><p>Hermione groaned.</p><hr /><p>Their next tutoring session was a bit of a mess.</p><p>James Potter came prepared - he had read that upcoming week's chapter, even taken notes in the margin of the text - but… well…</p><p>Hermione stared at the chicken scrawl - nothing worse than Harry's, honestly, but maybe it was a Potter thing? - and tried to make sense of the leaps in logic James took to get to the bottom of some of the answers in the text.</p><p>"Potter-" began Hermione, staring at the paper, and then cutting herself off. She cleared her throat and tried again. "James. How did you pass the last two years in Arithmancy at all?"</p><p>He shrugged, leaning back in his chair on the two back legs. "Third year wasn't too bad. And then in fourth, Padfoot - Sirius - mostly helped."</p><p>"I, uh, I just," Hermione trailed off. "Do… do you even <em>know</em> what Arithmancy is used for?"</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>"Potter - James - it's just math," stuttered Hermione, astounded by his lack of care. "I mean, some people use Arithmancy for Divination, because it's probability and statistics, but you can use it for a lot of other things."</p><p>"Like what?" he asked, but sounded bored. He wasn't even looking at her - he was looking at the ceiling! Hermione stared in incomprehension, disbelief bubbling in her stomach.</p><p>"I…" she floundered, physically looking around like an answer would come to her. Nothing came to mind; she was in the library, on a Friday night, with james Potter, trying to get him to understand the value of math. It was clear he'd rather be anywhere but with her - probably thinking about the upcoming Quidditch match Gryffindor had with Ravenclaw -</p><p><em>Eureka!</em> Thought Hermione, grinning. <em>Quidditch!</em></p><p>"Okay, look," said Hermione, leaning forward and grabbing her quill and a spare piece of parchment. "Arithmancy is in… like, everything. Every spell, every piece of magic, everything we do, can be broken down to the smallest bit of mathematical equation."</p><p>He was looking at her now, although from the bottom of his lenses, as they slipped down his nose. He was still leaning back in the chair.</p><p>"Spells are magical, they really are," continued Hermione, enthusiastically as she sketched things on the paper, "But they're also scientific. We can understand how a spell works because we break it down into wand movements and nonverbal commands; then, verbal commands as cues and phrases. Those movements and phrases have <em>meaning</em>, have weight. Arithmancy calculates that weight and helps us understand the strength of a spell, how it would mingle when cast against another, distance until it hits something, things like that."</p><p>She looked up. "Have you ever wondered what would happen if you cast <em>stupefy</em> and it never hit anything? Would it just go on and on and on and on forever until it did?"</p><p>Curiosity was in James' eyes, and he let the chair fall onto all four legs. "Not really, no…"</p><p>"What about Quidditch?" pressed Hermione, finishing her equations. "Do you not think it's strange that Quidditch players just fly around and hope for the best? What if you didn't have the plans you had? Do those plans change your teams' abilities and strengths on the pitch, leading to better results?"</p><p>He was leaning forward. "Plans do help - but it's not easy keeping to them when there are so many variables when you're playing and need to make split-second decisions."</p><p>"Of course," agreed Hermione, a small smile curling her lips upward. She slid the paper towards him. "But say - if you broke every player down into a variable in an equation - and you had a goal of how many points you wanted to score or how long you wanted the game to be played before your Seeker caught the Snitch - if you broke it into an equation, an <em>Arithmancy</em> equation, what do you think would happen?"</p><p>The teen's hazel eyes glanced down at the paper, and he looked over the markings Hermione had quickly scribbled with her quill. She even had a legend on the side:</p><p>a = Potter<br />b = Black<br />c &amp; d = Prewitt</p><p>And so forth, for the other players on the Gryffindor team; she had done so for the Ravenclaw team as well, and written in an equation where the Gryffindor team (all a through g for the seven players; and then u through z were Ravenclaw), and then substituted letters for the snitch, the quaffle, and the bludgers; wind speed; temperature; playing conditions based on the players' eating breakfast or not, and a end-score of 420 for Gryffindor, which would put them comfortably ahead for the Quidditch Cup.</p><p>James didn't quite understand it, but…</p><p>"You'd only have to play for approximately two hours before Blythe Parkin catches the Snitch," explained Hermione, tapping a portion of the long-stringed equation. "To combat Ravenclaw - who overthinks its plays - you just need to get into their heads; be confident; psyche them out in plays with evasive maneouvers. Keep them busy."</p><p>James looked up from the parchment, eyes narrowed. "Arithmancy can do something like this?"</p><p>Hermione gave a shrug, bringing her hand back close to her body and then went to inspect the nails, as nonchalantly as possible. "And more."</p><p>James hummed, and took the parchment, tucking it into his bag. "We'll see."</p><p>Hermione took the words graciously, and then began a review of the major equations learned back in third year to test Potter's memory and understanding of the theory. The two hours passed quickly, and they went their separate ways.</p><hr /><p>A week later, Gryffindor smashed Ravenclaw with 420 - 60 in their favour, with Parkins catching the Snitch two hours and three minutes into the game.</p><p>And Hermione, despite her house's terrible loss, stood in the stands with her groaning blue-and-bronze housemates around her, and smiled.</p><hr /><p align="center">

Hermione indulgently allowed Lily to maneuver her away from certain students and between school trunks on trolleys, unaware that Hermione had far more experience of the pre-Hogwarts rush than she did.</p><p>"I'm not afraid," said Hermione in response, her voice strong and confident.</p><p>"Good," her elder sister grinned. They shared a warm glance between two siblings, and then her green eyes had strayed. "Oh, look, there's Sev!"</p><p>Hermione swallowed thickly. Severus Snape remained a sore point for her; her knowledge of the bitter man he would become was stymied by the information she had on all that he did and the life he gave up to be a spy. Even Snape at twelve was snarky and had a mean streak that rivaled Petunia's. However, Hermione would never forgive him for his thoughtless comment of "I see no difference."</p><p>Even if it was yet to happen.</p><p>Or wouldn't happen - she shook her head. Time travel and verb tenses were hellish.</p><p>Hermione allowed Lily to shuffle her onto the train and into a compartment that she and Severus had commandeered for the trip. Hermione eased onto the plush red of the seat, and curiously looked through the window to the sea of students as they finished their goodbyes and eagerly found their friends. An explosion further down the train and loud laughter made Hermione's lips twitch in remembrance of Fred and George, but Severus, sitting across from her, groaned and slouched down the seat.</p><p>She glanced at him and then Lily, her eyebrows raised in curiosity.</p><p>Lily scowled. "It's that stupid James Potter and Sirius Black."</p><p>"Your housemates?" asked Hermione, already knowing the answer.</p><p>"Yes, troublemakers, the lot of them!" the redhead huffed. "They tease and bully <em>everyone</em>! And absolutely hate the Slytherins."</p><p>Hermione turned to Severus, whose scowl was reaching his future self's epic proportions. "Like you, Severus?" she inquired innocently.</p><p>He slouched further, two blots of red high on his pale cheeks.</p><p>"You'll want to stay out of their way, Hermione," lectured Lily. "They don't prank me as badly as the others, but it's a free-for-all with those boys. Honestly! I don't know why Remus goes along with it."</p><p><em>Because he's afraid they'll abandon him</em>, answered Hermione mentally, turning away from Lily as she and Severus began discussing the upcoming school year and their classes, including which electives they would choose for their third year.</p><p>Hermione tuned it out. She accepted that she was somehow stuck in the past; that somehow, she had been reborn into the Evans family. Over the years, once she had pushed past the horrible denial that something like this could happen to her, she began to come to terms with her situation and even grew to love her new family. Leo and Rose had far more time for their daughters than Hermione's own original birth parents Richard and Miranda had; Leo and Rose were happy with whatever their children decided, whether it was Petunia excelling in home economics or Lily and Hermione being witches.</p><p>Of course, there was a part of Hermione that felt morally responsible for stopping Voldemort and his Death Eaters, but… <em>I've already done that</em>, she would remind herself. She would help here or there, but this Hermione, her in the now, only wanted to continue her research, keep her head down for as long as possible, and potentially clean house once 1981 drew to a close.</p><p>If her research could potentially help the Order of the Phoenix or stop Death Eaters, then - it was a coincidence, really (and if that meant ignoring the morality of letting her sister die… well, she was working on it - but what 'it' was, was up in the air. Would she save Lily? Would she raise Harry as her own? Hermione didn't know; what if she changed things too much? Or worse - <em>what if nothing changed at all</em>?).</p><p>But she didn't want to involve herself further until necessary. Lily, she interacted with because she was her sister; and Severus was Lily's friend (<em>for now,</em> she reminded herself, already mentally counting down to her sister's OWLs). If she could avoid those she knew and interacted with in the future - like Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, the Weasleys, or other Order members - then she would be happy. But that meant no Gryffindor.</p><p>It would mean not watching Lily and James eventually fall in love; it would mean never helping Remus after a terrible full moon, bringing him chocolate; it would mean never sitting next to a moody, bitter Sirius as his family continued to tear him down. It meant no Weasley jumpers at Christmas, no war stories from Alastor Moody and no pig snouts from Tonks.</p><p>It would be lonely.</p><p><em>No different than before</em>, Hermione thought to herself. <em>I managed for years before Hogwarts in my past life, and I managed years before here too.</em></p><p>Eventually, Severus ended up with some Slytherin friends and Lily had a chinwag with the other Gryffindor girls in her dorm, the names only recognizable to Hermione due to their membership to the Order of the Phoenix and their memorable, gruesome deaths.</p><p>Hermione was alone, and truthfully - that was how she liked it.</p><hr /><p>"RAVENCLAW!" the hat shouted, and Hermione Granger, now Hermione Evans, joined the politely applauding table. Her nondescript Hogwarts tie changed to reflect the Ravenclaw colours of blue and bronze, and she slid demurely onto the bench somewhere in the middle of the table.</p><p>Around her, her year mates and housemates were engrossed in the Sorting, or clandestinely reading large books on their laps.</p><p><em>Yes</em>, thought Hermione looking around, <em>I'm going to disappear perfectly.</em></p><hr /><p>
  <strong>October 1975</strong>
</p><p>Hermione's explanation of arithmancy to be used alongside practical applications like Quidditch revitalized James Potter, and soon, he became a Friday night fixture at her tiny table in the library. The side effects of his new-found interest in the field of math were both positive and negative: positive because Hermione had the opportunity to see someone else begin to <em>enjoy</em> math and find a use for it, and negative because it meant she was no longer invisible.</p><p>The first few weeks of their study sessions were peaceful: Hermione would coax James through the third-year material, quizzing him on the foundations of calculus and probability statistics, and then bring in the arithmetic formulas from their Hogwarts classes. The additional non-magical material of higher maths provided James with a stronger grasp of the material, and soon they were on the fourth year revision material.</p><p>That's when Sirius joined them.</p><p>At fifteen, Sirius was <em>not</em> the same man Hermione came to know in the future. That Sirius was broody, prone to explode in a terrible temper at the drop of a wrong word or condescending tone; his eye would flash and his bark was just as terrible as his bite. That man was stifled energy looking for an outlet.</p><p><em>This</em> Sirius was loud, charismatic, eager to please, but also easily bored and unknowingly cruel. His first night, after sniffing them out - almost literally, as with the increased use of their nicknames, Hermione was sure they had recently become animagi - he spent almost their entire two hours wheedling James to join him outside for an illegal broom race, or planting dungbombs in the dungeons, or help him chat up a sixth-year Hufflepuff, or, or, or.</p><p>Hermione felt her annoyance at the handsome teen grow the longer he remained hovering over James's shoulders. It reached a peak by the time he flung himself in the only other free chair at her table, in between the two of them.</p><p>"C'mon, Jimmie-boy," whined Sirius, leaning forward, eyes scanning the revised quiz Hermione mocked up for James, "Let's go, yeah? Moony and Wormtail are waiting for us. We've got that thing - the <em>you-know-what</em>," he dropped his voice to a conspiratory whisper, which missed the mark with Hermione sitting right there, able to hear every word, "so we can go to the <em>you-know-where</em>. And then maybe finish up with a trip to the kitchens. Whaddya say, mate?"</p><p>James looked absolutely torn. His hazel eyes kept glancing at Sirius, who was intently focused on his best friend's face, like a dog staring down its prey, while James quickly slid them to Hermione. For her part, Hermione thought she absolutely looked unaffected, calmly sitting there without a care if Potter went off to do some Marauder shenanigans.</p><p>In reality, Hermione had a very red flush to her cheeks. Her dark whiskey coloured eyes were flashing a strange lighter hue that reminded James vaguely of Remus, but he knew that Hermione was no werewolf. The quill in her hand was almost vibrating with near intensity, and the fingers gripping it was a pale white from stress and tension.</p><p>Hermione Evans was one word away from a complete blowout, even if she didn't know it.</p><p>But, James knew it.</p><p>And from the wicked glint in Sirius's eyes, he knew it too. And was ready to give the brunette that extra push.</p><p>Sirius's grey eyes turned to Hermione then, and James watched in horrified fascination, like a miss-cast spell decimating an entire class and turning it into a tragedy. With a flick up and down what he could see of the fourteen-year-old's body sitting at the table, Sirius was dismissive and turned back to James, saying, "If you needed help in Arithmancy, mate, you just had to ask. You don't need this walking library to help you. Who'd want to spend their Fridays here, anyway? She's not much to look at." He paused and leered at Hermione. "<em>Yet</em>, anyway."</p><p>"<em>Excuse me</em>?" Hermione's voice was frosty.</p><p>"You heard me, sweetheart," replied Sirius. "You're just a tiny thing, aren't you? Full of-" he paused and looked up. "<em>Hair</em>."</p><p>Hermione stared at Sirius in complete and utter disbelief - in fact, it was like the entire world <em>paused</em> for that moment, and at that moment, Hermione was able to put to words everything she was contemplating, debating.</p><p>There was no other reason for what she did next. Other than Sirius, whom she knew well and dearly, had always been able to push her buttons with an exact precision that rivaled Ron at his cruelest. But it was then, with his flippant comment, fully intended to see what Hermione was capable of, that made Hermione think: <em>fuck the timeline</em>.</p><p>And then she drew back her left hand, free of her quill, and slammed directly into Sirius's cheek, socking him so hard that he collapsed in surprise against the table, catching it with the flat of his palms, which made a loud <em>smack</em>.</p><p>The library, which was quiet but had a present, low hum of conversation, disappeared like someone had cast <em>Silencio</em> over the entire area. Hermione could feel the weight of stares on her - she was no longer invisible.</p><p>Sirius moaned against the table, sliding down against it until his back was once more against his seat. A hand was pressed to his jaw, and he stared at Hermione with wide grey eyes. James, with wide eyes of his own, was hovering over Sirius and glancing back and forth between his best friend and his tutor.</p><p>Hermione scowled deeply at the teen, and snapped, "'<em>Though she be but little, she is fierce</em>'!" With that said, she wandlessly summoned her parchment and quills with a wave of her hand - ignoring that such a feat by a fourteen year made both Sirius and James's eyebrows shoot upwards - then shove everything in her bag, stomping out of the library, her sanctum, now and forever lost due to her tutoring of James Potter.</p><p>She <em>knew</em> it had been a mistake!</p><hr /><p>"Did she -," started Sirius, rubbing his hand along his jaw, which was throbbing in time to his heartbeat, "Did she just punch me in the face and then quote Shakespeare before flouncing away?"</p><p>James, eyes stuck on the retreating figure of his crush's sister, nodded absently. "Yeah, Padfoot, I think she did."</p><p>Sirius turned to James and announced, "I think I'm in love."</p><p>Horrified, James couldn't think of a reply.</p><hr /><p>The path to the Room of Requirement was clear, and Hermione took full advantage to stomp her Mary Janes hard on the stone, to vent some of her anger.</p><p><em>How dare he? Who does he think he is? </em>She spat angrily in her mind, feeling her magic swell and spark along her fingertips in response. <em>A tiny thing full of hair, said he. I'll show him tiny, alright!</em></p><p>She had been so careful; so sure of her new life and being invisible that she would never draw the eye of the Marauders. Even after she began tutoring James Potter, his friends had let her be - minus that terribly annoying prank James and Sirius did after the first disastrous tutoring session - and Hermione had breathed a sigh of relief. She wasn't changing any timelines (maybe James needed Arithmancy help in the previous timeline?), she wasn't upsetting any relationship dynamics beyond the ones she was already involved in (her professors, her new family, Barty, and Regulus), and for the most part, everything seemed to be on track to what was going to be a horrible guerilla civil war in just three years' time.</p><p>See? Perfect. Everything was going the way it should.</p><p>Hermione paced in front of the blank wall where the Room of Requirement's door would appear, and then, once it bled into existence, she dove for the handle and yanked it open, storming in without realizing the interior. It wasn't until she was several steps in that she recognized the location.</p><p>"You have <em>got</em> to be <em>kidding</em> me!"</p><p>Although it wasn't as doom and gloom as it used to be, the dark panelled walls and dark hardwood floor was familiar enough from spending most of her teen summers at Grimmauld Place. Harry had cleaned the ancestral Black home up as a project after the war during his Auror training, modernizing what he could and repainting anything else. Gone were the spiderwebs and house elf heads, as well as the creepy Black family portraits that hissed insults as you walked by.</p><p>While it would never be "light and airy," the changes Harry had made to Grimmauld place made it appear more Edwardian: heavy and dark wallpaper, dark panels, dark floors, crown moulding, and brilliant hanging chandeliers in many rooms, as well as an overabundance of fireplaces and - with Hermione's insistence - squishy armchairs.</p><p>Harry was in one of those squishy armchairs in the library, his ankle crossed over his knee and his fingers laced together under his chin as he watched her enter the room from behind his glasses. Except, Harry was not the forty-year-old man Hermione knew him as before she "died," as his hair wasn't salt-and-pepper, he wasn't wearing the fine tailored Head Auror robes, or carry himself with the ease of a man who knew himself and his place in the world, finally.</p><p>No, Hermione knew that the Room chose a Harry she could relate to best in her new existence, as the Harry in the armchair, sitting comfortably <em>like</em> his older self in confidence, was the scrawny fourteen-year-old she knew who was troubled by his inclusion in the TriWizard Tournament. Despite his comfy seat, Hermione could see the foundation of <em>her</em> Harry, in the hunch of his shoulders, in the wary gaze he cast her as she entered, the skinny arms and pointy elbows underneath oversized clothes.</p><p>"Harry," greeted Hermione through gritted teeth. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>"I'm here to help, Hermione," the Room-provided Harry replied back, his tone open and friendly in comparison to hers.</p><p>"Help how?"</p><p>Harry shrugged. "You seem to be having trouble reconciling your place in this new timeline."</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "Oh, now <em>that</em> would give it away that you're not Harry; he never used the word 'reconcile' in his life."</p><p>Not-Harry grinned.</p><p>Hermione sighed and sat in the other armchair, perpendicular to his. "I shouldn't be here, Harry."</p><p>"Who's to say that?" he replied.</p><p>Hermione frowned. "What do you mean?"</p><p>"I mean," began not-Harry, a distinct bossy tone to his voice that was more reminiscent of her than him, "How do you know that you were not meant to be here? How do you know that you were <em>never</em> meant to be here?"</p><p>Hermione's frown deepened. "Are you suggesting that me growing up in our time was the wrong one?"</p><p>Harry grinned, impishly.</p><p>"Oh, come on!" moaned Hermione. "You come in here, you don't help me, tell me that the entire <em>belief</em> of my existence in this time is wrong…! You-you claim to be a creation of my mind and yet you don't even provide me with a logical answer!"</p><p>"Hermione," said Harry in an extremely patronizing way, looking over the rim of his glasses at her, "Your subconscious mind knows that I would never do or say that. The Harry you knew was emotional and jumped to conclusions - I rarely followed things through <em>logically</em>."</p><p>Hermione stared at Harry. "You are the worst room construct, <em>ever</em>."</p><p>Not-Harry grinned, a wide, toothy smile.</p><p>They sat in silence while Hermione came down from her rage-induced response from hitting Sirius, until she sighed, long and deep, and snuggled deeper into the chair.</p><p>"Do you feel better now?" asked Harry, after minutes had gone by.</p><p>Hermione nodded, then asked, "What did you mean - about me not knowing whether I was always meant to be here or not?"</p><p>"Well, in time travel, like what we did in our third year," began Harry carefully, thinking his words out, "We existed in two places at once, and the things we did in the past reflected our knowledge of the present. For example, we never <em>saw</em> Buckbeak get executed and because of that, we could change things accordingly to save him. I <em>thought</em> I saw my father save us, but in reality, I saw <em>me</em> save us that night with the Patronus."</p><p>"And?" groused Hermione.</p><p>"There were always two of us in the same physical space. And we didn't actually change anything that hadn't already been changed - like a loop," explained Harry patiently. "But now - you're not just <em>back in time</em>, Hermione. You're not existing outside of those living their day-to-day. <em>You're actually in the past as part of it.</em>"</p><p>"Your point?"</p><p>"Hermione, you don't need to worry about changing things or keeping things the same," said Harry, a gentle tone to his voice. "You're here. You actually belong; you were reborn as part of the Evans family, and are now existing alongside my mother and aunt, as well as my father and his friends. You are not an interloper in this time, afraid that one touch will stop you from returning and creating a paradox. You are part of this time, woven into its very fabric."</p><p>He stopped, and then his green eyes pierced her. "But you knew this already."</p><p>Hermione turned away, slightly shame-faced.</p><p>"How do you figure?" she mumbled.</p><p>"Well, I don't exist, not really," replied Harry matter-of-factly. "I am and respond in a way that your subconscious tells you that I would react! So, really these thoughts were yours."</p><p>Hermione stared at Harry in stupefied horror.</p><p>"Oh, <em>Merlin</em>!" she breathed. "I'm arguing with myself about my place in this timeline if only to assuage my own guilt—it's literally me or me. I really am a know-it-all, aren't I?"</p><p>Harry smiled and nodded.</p><p>"Hermione, if you want me to say 'stop being selfish and <em>do</em> something with your life and the opportunities afforded,' I will tell you that," said Harry gently. "But if you also want me to say 'keep your head down, girl, don't you know the world will end?' I can do that too."</p><p>"That's me saying that to me, Harry," blinked Hermione. "Angel me versus Devil me."</p><p>"Is it?"</p><p>Hermione let out a sound of frustration. "<em>Uuuggghhhhh</em>."</p><p>"Hermione," sighed Harry, "Answer me this: are you happy?"</p><p>"Am I happy, what kind of question is that?" snapped Hermione. "Are we talking about a definitive state? An emotive <em>moment</em> in time? Overall?"</p><p>"All, any, both."</p><p>Hermione frowned. "Then <em>no</em>, of course not, Harry. No, I'm <em>not</em> happy. I haven't been happy for some time. I haven't been happy at work before I died and ended up here; I wasn't happy with where my experiments were going. I wasn't happy with being <em>reborn into your mother's side of the family, you little toerag</em>-"</p><p>"I get it," replied a slightly worried Harry. "You weren't happy. When <em>are</em> you happy?"</p><p>Hermione snapped her mouth shut and honestly thought about the question. When was she happy? She was happy with she saw Barty successfully cast his spell nonverbally. She was happy when James <em>understood</em> the point of Arithmancy. She was happy when she heard the satisfying sound Sirius' cheek made when her hand connected to it. She was even happy in the summer, spending time with Petunia and Lily.</p><p>She was… kind of happy in this time.</p><p>"Huh."</p><p>Hermione spied Harry's rather smug face, and then sighed, "Okay, but you're a figment of my imagination, so just telling me what I need to know to make myself feel justified seems a bit circular."</p><p>Harry's smile stretched into a genuine one. "Does it matter if it works?"</p><p>"If I change things…" she warned, slowly, "It could be worse."</p><p>"It could be better," he countered.</p><p>"It won't be easy," she tried again.</p><p>"When is it ever?" retorted Harry.</p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes. Then she sighed, but it wasn't a tired sound, or unhappy. "Okay, Harry. You win." There was a small smile on her lips. "Let's go change the world as we know it. I'll decide my own path from now on."</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC...</p>

  <strong>November 1975</strong>
</p><p>After her rather confusing talk with herself-disguised-as-Harry in the Room of Requirements, Hermione returned to the Ravenclaw Common Room, waving off Barty's concerned looks and calls of her name as she trudged up the tower until she flopped on her bed in the fourth year dormitory.</p><p>Philosophical debate aside, Hermione's existence in the past <em>was</em> unlike her previous journey into the past with Harry and the instance of her time turner. There, two versions of her existed; did this kind of magic imply that by September 1979, <em>another</em> Hermione would be born? Or was Granger-Hermione suddenly nonexistent?</p><p>What did that mean in terms of paradoxes? If Granger-Hermione failed to exist, did that mean there wasn't going to be an Evans-Hermione? That there had <em>never been</em> an Evans-Hermione? But if there hadn't been an Evans-Hermione ever, then could there have been a Granger-Hermione, to begin with to get transported back in time…?</p><p>Hermione's face pinched as a vicious headache bloomed across her forehead. She moaned, although her pillow muffled it and her face sunk into the feathery marshmallow. Luckily, the dorm was empty, many of her fellow classmates and roommates having much better things to do on a Friday night, especially one before a Hogsmeade weekend.</p><p>With any luck, the rumours that would no doubt be flying around Hogwarts of her punching Sirius Black will be overtaken by something that someone would do while at Hogsmeade, or by a rather embarrassing attempt of Potter's on asking Lily out, once again.</p><p>No one would remember silly Hermione Evans and her suckerpunching Sirius Black, flouncing away via Shakespeare quote.</p><p><em>At least</em>, she thought,<em> I hope not</em>.</p><hr /><p>Hermione was early up on that Saturday morning. She was dressed in her civvies, cast-offs of Petunia and Lily's that Hermione thought was similar enough to her comfort-zone of fashion ranging from the 90s to 10s, which also didn't include polyester pantsuits, bell bottoms, or pastel. While Petunia preferred what Hermione called "sophisticated housewife" in blouses and knee-length skirts that reminded her more of a 50s Stepford, Lily was the flower child in Bohemian tassels and blouses, suede skirts and wide-leg trousers or rustic-inspired dresses.</p><p>Hermione was neither, opting for the comfort of knee-length skirts, with knee socks and sweaters overtop that reminded her of her original Hogwarts uniform (the skirt lengths were <em>much</em> longer in the 70s, she had noted immediately); or wide-leg trousers with smart, crisp blouses tucked into the high waists; or the not-quite-there-yet popularity of glam punk with her tight black jeans and flannel shirts - her hair certainly fit in with its wild, riotous curls that could either be disco perm or glamorous mane.</p><p>Hoping to do as she usually did during Hogsmeade weekends, Hermione dressed in comfortable jeans and flannel - as she would be continuing her research and practice in transmutation circles and wandless magic with Barty, who also never attended Hogsmeade (unlike Regulus, who often went with <em>dates</em> now) - and met with her best friend at the foot of the stairs in their Common Room.</p><p>"Are you alright?" Barty asked nervously, glancing up and down at her.</p><p>Hermione frowned. "Why wouldn't I be?"</p><p>"There are - rumours -"</p><p>"About <em>what</em>?" Hermione's narrow-eyed look had Barty struggle for a moment before answering with a sigh.</p><p>"That you punched Black?" The rising octave at the end of the sentence made it more of a question than a statement and Hermione mentally groaned.</p><p>"Anything else?"</p><p>Barty shook his head, his brown eyes wide and entreating as he looked at her. "You didn't <em>really</em> punch him, did you?"</p><p>When she didn't answer, he flinched.</p><p>"But <em>why</em>?" he nearly wailed as they entered the Great Hall for breakfast. "You <em>don't</em> want the spotlight! You <em>hate</em> any kind of attention - specifically theirs!"</p><p>Hermione fidgeted as they sat, and began reaching for some toast, taking in the soft chatter of her Ravenclaw mates and the excited noise coming from the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor tables behind them.</p><p>"It - it was an accident," she murmured offside to him as he bit into a sugary jam tart. "I lost my temper. It won't happen again."</p><p>The look Barty sent her was <em>oh, really?</em> to which she stared at him. He muttered, "Well, let's see if that is true, because here comes Black - and not the one we like."</p><p>"<em>Whu</em>-"</p><p>Just as she spoke, the noise volume around her plummeted as someone slid in the seat next to her, comfortably reaching for her half-eaten toast, plucking it from her hand. Hermione watched, following that toast with her eyes, as it made its way toward Sirius Black, who bit into it and sent her a cheeky grin around the bread.</p><p>"That -" sputtered Hermione. "That's my toast."</p><p>"It's a tasty slice of bread, love," replied Sirius, the grin still on his lips as he held the toast back out to her to take a bite. "Sharesies?"</p><p>Hermione stared at him for a solid minute, incomprehensibly. Sirius looked as handsome as ever, his curls pushed back and off his forehead, his grey eyes warm and practically <em>daring</em> her to punch him again, in casual Muggle wear of jeans and a jumper with a jacket thrown over top.</p><p>She then looked around, realized how many people were watching them, and asked, quite sincerely, "Are you lost?"</p><p>"Nah, Princess," the fifth-year Gryffindor grinned at her. "I'm right where I want to be." He leaned forward a bit, causing her to lean back into Barty.</p><p>Her best friend wrapped a protective arm around Hermione's shoulders, along her sternum, and drew her back further into his chest. His glare smoldered and had it been a spell, Sirius would've been incinerated by the intensity the Ravenclaw was projecting. Sirius, of course, being himself, ignored him.</p><p>"Say - Hermione, love," began Sirius, eyes on hers, "D'you have a date for Hogsmeade yet?"</p><p>Hermione blinked. "No."</p><p>"Oh?" asked Sirius, leaning forward a bit more.</p><p>Hermione, in response, leaned back, and Barty slid a bit down the bench, into a scowling sixth year who told him to "watch it, Crouch!", sharply.</p><p>She then narrowed her eyes. "<em>Why</em>?" she asked, elongating the vowel.</p><p>"Why, love," grinned Sirius, lowering his voice to a husky timbre, "'<em>Hear my soul speak: / The very instant that I saw you, did / My heart fly to your service.</em>'"</p><p>There was a hushed silence, a formed of baited breath around them as girls leaned in closer to hear Hermione's reply, while the boys attempted to look cool and not like they were watching for their own pickup lines and tips from Hogwarts' smoothest serial dater.</p><p>Behind her, Hermione could feel Barty's jaw swing down as his mouth dropped open, being pressed against her temple. For herself, Hermione wondered if she had actually died in her sleep without realizing it because Sirius Black was asking her out. <em>Her</em>. By quoting <em>Shakespeare</em>.</p><p>To be sure, Hermione carefully looked around, but nope - he was still looking at her. Frowning, Hermione looked back at Sirius, and said, carefully, "No."</p><p>Sirius, in return, blinked. "No?"</p><p>"No," she nodded firmly. Behind her, Barty exhaled in relief.</p><p>"No… you won't go to Hogsmeade with me?" asked Sirius, in confirmation although his tone radiated his confusion.</p><p>Hermione nodded. "Yes."</p><p>He perked up. "Yes, you <em>will</em> go with me?"</p><p>Hermione wanted to smack her head against the table. "I'm sorry, when did this turn into an Abbott and Costello routine? Black. Read my lips." Hermione leaned in close, in a parody of earlier in which Sirius was now leaning back a little, but his eyes were nearly cross eyed as he looked down his nose to focus on Hermione's mouth as she enunciated each word, "<em>Not. In. A. Million. Years</em>."</p><p>Behind her, Barty sniggered into his tart, happily biting into it again as Hermione re-established the social order of her not being interested in the Marauders, and turned to casually dismiss the now gobsmacked Gryffindor.</p><p>Sirius hummed thoughtfully beside her, his grey eyes reading something off her, but got up from the table. He did lean down, hovering his mouth just by her ear, and whisper, "Until later, Princess."</p><p>Before leaving, he gave her a jaunty flick of his fingers goodbye, as well as a wink. He then returned to the Gryffindor table. Immediately, the noise level rose and Hermione could hear parts of the many conversations going on around her:</p><p>
  <em>"-punched him yesterday-"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"-it was in the library!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"-sweet, reciting love poetry-"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"-that was Shakespeare, Delaney, Merlin; aren't you supposed to be a Ravenclaw?"<br />"-what a tart, turning down Sirius Black-!"</em>
</p><p><em>"-he's a </em>dreamboat<em>!"</em></p><p>Hermione sighed, looking down at her plate. Maybe she should have gone with 'exit: pursued by bear' as her parting line the previous night instead? <em>And worse</em>, she thought mournfully, Black had taken her toast.</p><hr /><p>If Hermione had hoped that Sirius Black's interest in her would wane, she was grossly underestimating the teen's tenacity to go after something that intrigued him - a credit to his future animagus form, or one that he already had, she surmised.</p><p>Sirius tried to sit with her and Barty at dinner again, nodding to her friend and turning to her with a smile and a partially wilting flower that he magicked up with a deft flick of his wrist as he presented it to her.</p><p>"'<em>Love sought is good, but giv'n unsought is better</em>,'" he recited, imploring her with wide grey puppy dog eyes to take the flower.</p><p>Hermione looked at it, and then at Sirius, and said, blandly, "That's kind of ironic," and then turned back to Barty, as they were in the middle of their charms homework. Sirius pouted, looking down at the wilted flower, and blanched.</p><p>"Erm," he said, looking around the Ravenclaw table, but other than several young girls and a few boys, the one he was trying to get to know better was ignoring him.</p><p>"-Flitwick said that if you give a bit more of a curl at the end of this spell, though, it'll throw off the entire arithmetic formula," Crouch was arguing, glancing up from their shared notes.</p><p>Sirius leaned forward.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "Yes, if you leave the spell the way it is - but if you change the casting - from <em>arcanum revelare</em> to <em>revelare abscondita</em>, you can add the flourish at the end."</p><p>Interest piqued, as a part of his brain was going <em>are they </em>inventing and modifying <em>spells?</em>, Sirius leaned forward a bit more, and then shuffled along the bench so that his thigh pressed against Hermione's.</p><p>She glanced at him. "What?"</p><p>He looked at their notes, which were covered with the fourth-year curriculum Flitwick taught - it was a spell for revealing hidden items, mostly used for inks and misplaced socks - but then at the different coloured ink that Hermione and Crouch were using to adjust the spell to make it more powerful. A series of equations and strange symbols and lines made Sirius blink in surprise.</p><p>"This is - seventh-year material!" sputtered Sirius, eyes wide.</p><p>The look Hermione and Crouch gave him made him feel like he just missed a first-year answer to a question McGonagall just asked.</p><p>Beginning to fidget, and thinking that maybe he was out of his depth, he left. Hermione and Barty would later call it "running away" (which Regulus would mention was something Sirius did quite often to avoid things that made him uncomfortable), but Sirius would argue it was a "strategic retreat."</p><p>He needed some help from the Marauders.</p><hr /><p>Sirius turned up outside of Transfiguration on Monday morning, with a wide grin and a pleasant, "Morning, Princess!" as he strode up to her, clearly recovered from his Saturday retreat to plan a new attack.</p><p>Hermione, squished between Barty and Regulus, took one look at the Gryffindor, shoved her book bag at Barty, and turned on her heel.</p><p>"Wait! Hermione! Love! Come back!" shouted Sirius behind her as she disappeared in the crowd. Behind her, she could see him standing on his toes and trying to find her, waving his arm as frantically as she did in her first year in her first life when she knew the answer to a question.</p><p>But she sure as hell heard his voice with an extended <em>sonorous</em> in the halls cry after her, "'<em>For stony limits cannot hold love out, / And what love can do that dares love attempt</em>'!"</p><p>"Mr. Black!" cried McGonagall, "What is this shouting nonsense?"</p><p>Hermione's lips turned up and she ducked down a secret passage to Herbology. It was somewhat amusing. And it was nice to see Sirius smile, acting more his age than the rough, worn-out man he'd become.</p><p><em>I suppose I can allow him </em>some<em> fun,</em> she thought generously. <em>But I'm not going to make it easy on him to talk to me. And I won't be going on a date, either.</em></p><p>The mental image of her and Sirius on a date to Madam Puddifoot's - and even better, <em>Harry's</em> reaction - kept the grin on her face for the rest of the day.</p><hr /><p>On Wednesday, Hermione thought she had escaped Sirius, ducking and weaving between classmates and crowds, eating in the kitchens, and generally avoiding her usual haunts of the library, the clock tower, or the Room. The Room of Requirement was incredibly helpful, as well, but if she spent too much time in there, it failed to be a secret; Regulus was bound to be more suspicious than he was and Barty couldn't keep a secret from him if his life depended on it.</p><p>Instead, Hermione took advantage of the crisp November snow and went for a walk around the Great Lake, snacking on an apple as she mentally calculated the next step for her transmutations. She had mastered several early charms and spells in the Hogwarts curriculum, but Hermione had others plans.</p><p>While the majority of the student populace was inside the castle, Hermione figured <em>now</em> was an excellent time to make her next attempt: transmutations without a spell. Theoretically, Hermione posited that she could use her magic instinctively to create what she needed without the arithmetic equations that were bound to many spells. Once she knew the properties of what she wanted to transfigure or transmute, it would be like muscle memory - one she wanted to test on a patch of snow under a tree near the Lake.</p><p>Taking a bite out of the apple, and sinking her teeth into it deeply to leave it partially hanging out of her mouth, Hermione shoved her arms out in front of her, palms out with the left on top of the right with her thumbs touching in a triangular shape.</p><p>Her eyes closed, and she took a deep inhale through her nose (mindful of the apple still in her mouth), and then swung her arms gently down, separating the two hands in a wide arc away from one another, picturing the snow melting, the water reforming and freezing, turning away to reveal the barren grass below as it rolled and condensed into three separate, perfectly shaped balls -</p><p>"Princess!"</p><p>Hermione's eyes popped open and whatever magic she gathered in her hands dissipated, and she inhaled, choking on a bit of apple as her teeth came down fully and took a chunk out. The apple dropped from her mouth to the snow, and she whirled to stare at Sirius.</p><p>The Gryffindor was grinning at her, surrounded by his friends, but his grin slipped off his face as he realized that he had startled her badly.</p><p>Hermione coughed, her hands in front of her mouth, but then Potter was there, slapping her hard on her back and staring down at her from behind his round glasses, muttering, "Hermione, you okay? Breathe. Breathe, Hermione!"</p><p>Her face was bright red as she finally managed to either swallow the apple piece or cough chunks up into her hands. Those in her hand she swept away with a nonverbal and wandless <em>scourgify</em> from her skin, leaving it a rubbed pink, and there were tears in her eyes. At her side, Potter rubbed circles on her back. It was strangely comforting - much better than Harry's awkward pats.</p><p>Sirius's face was ashen and remorseful as he slowly took a step closer to her. "Merlin, Evans, I'm sorry - I didn't know you were eating anything."</p><p>Snuffling a bit and blinking back her tears from the coughs, Hermione took a deep breath and balefully glared up at the much taller teen.</p><p>"What are you doing out here?" she grit out.</p><p>Sirius blinked, looking at her and then Potter, and then Lupin and Pettigrew, the latter two who both held brooms in their hands. "Ah - we were practicing for Quidditch." Then his face changed and his voice rose earnestly. "And what were <em>you</em> doing out here? What was that that you were doing? I've never seen magic like that!"</p><p>Hermione eyed Lupin and Pettigrew - knowing the future possibility of what Pettigrew would do - and decided to keep her abilities quiet. Instead, she sniffled delicately and tilted her chin out. "I don't have to explain myself to you, Sirius."</p><p>"Erm," said Potter from Hermione's side.</p><p>"It's bloody freezing out here, Princess!" retorted Sirius, and as if on cue, a chilly wind kicked up and Hermione involuntarily shivered. "You should be inside, where it's warm!"</p><p><em>Is he… being serious?</em> Thought Hermione, stifling a giggle at the pun her brain went to. Instead, she shook her head and dug deep for the ire she usually felt.</p><p>"<em>Excuse me</em>," huffed Hermione, "Who do you think you are? My <em>dad</em>? I can be outside in the cold, if I want, Black!"</p><p>Pettigrew's head was bouncing back and forth, as he watched them bicker, while Lupin sighed. Potter hadn't removed his hand from Hermione's back, and the warmth from it soaked in through her jacket as he tried again, tentatively saying, "Pads. Pads - really - c'mon. Leave Evans be, yeah?"</p><p>Sirius's own head whipped around to look at his best friend. "<em>Leave her be?</em>" he echoed. "Like you leave her sister alone?"</p><p>Potter flushed a very embarrassing red that clashed with his Gryffindor scarf. The hand on her back twitched, but Potter didn't add anything else to the conversation.</p><p>Instead, Sirius turned back to Hermione, eyes troubled as they looked at her pink and glove-free hands, to her free hair and scarf-less neck, as well as her thin flannel, <em>sans </em>jacket. "Do you have a death wish, woman? Get inside!" at that pronouncement, Sirius went to unzip his jacket. "Merlin - you're shivering - take my jacket and keep warm!"</p><p>Hermione stared at him just as Lupin stepped forward and said, "Hey now, Padfoot - it's cold out, why don't you keep your jacket on?"</p><p>"Black," said Hermione, her voice tight, feeling odd as she was about to say something <em>Ron Weasley</em> once told. "Are you a wizard or not? It's called a <em>warming charm</em> for a reason."</p><p>There was a sly look in Hermione's eyes as she asked, innocently, "Or are you having wand performance issues?"</p><p>The stupefied look on Sirius's face - like he got hit with a wet fish - was worth the last five days' of Sirius Black tracking her down and reciting Shakespeare to her. And this was hopefully the end of it.</p><p>The hand on her back twitched again - just a bit -, and then Potter was trying to muffle a snort, but it was contagious and both Pettigrew and Lupin were fighting back smiles.</p><p>"Oh," said Black, blinking. There was a gleam in his eyes when he spoke next, his tone of grudging respect. "Oh. Well played, Princess. Touché."</p><p>She nodded once and stepped away from Potter, who let his hand slide down her back as she did so. When she shivered next it wasn't from being cold, but she refused to analyze it. "Excuse me, boys. I have somewhere I need to be."</p><p>She then walked between Potter on her right and Black, Lupin, and Pettigrew on her left, never looking back, even when Sirius shouted after her, "'<em>For stony limits cannot hold love out, / And what love can do that dares love attempt</em>.'"</p><p>She sighed.</p><hr /><p>She had hoped that Sirius's notorious roving eye would have meant that his interest in her would've faded by Friday when her appointed tutoring hour with James Potter rolled by.</p><p>Unfortunately, it hadn't.</p><p>Hermione valiantly ignored Sirius sitting at the same table with her and James for the first forty minutes. As per their routine, James handed Hermione his returned homework for her to check over, while she had him do a late-semester third year revision quiz. He had speedily progressed to the point that just before the winter holidays, Hermione thought he would be on the fourth year material and potentially ready for his OWLs at the end of that school year.</p><p>Once he completed the revision, Hermione asked him to review the mistakes she pointed out on his homework; he would attempt them again while she reviewed his quiz. They worked in silence for the first hour, usually, and it was no different that night except for Sirius's gaze on her.</p><p>It made her nervous. His eyes never left her face, or rather, her, as she sometimes glanced over to see the grey dip to her hands, or her neck. She was sure there was a blush on her cheeks and potentially a streak of ink on her cheek.</p><p>Despite that, the teen remained surprisingly silent.</p><p>It was unnerving.</p><p>Potter's nervous glances toward his friend didn't help either.</p><p>Hermione was on the last set of revisions on Potter's paper when Sirius sighed, loudly. Her quill streaked red ink across the page and she swore loudly and colourfully.</p><p>"Hermione!" cried a delighted Sirius, eyes bright.</p><p>"God-<em>fucking</em>-damnit, Sirius!" Hermione slammed her quill down on the table and snapped her fingers over the parchment, watching as her nonverbal <em>tergeo</em> siphoned the spilled ink into a large red blob that, with a directed flick of a pointer finger, returned to her inkwell. "<em>What</em> is your problem? Hmm? Why won't you to <em>leave me alone</em>?"</p><p>"Because you're so interesting," he replied, a bit lovesick.</p><p>Hermione's eyes narrowed on him. "What."</p><p>Sirius sat up, eyes wide and pushed his curly black hair off from his face up and over his forehead. He grinned at her. "You're smart, Hermione. And - and <em>powerful</em>. You're kind, even though you hide it behind this <em>awesome</em> mean persona that would make the Slytherins weep with fear. You're ahead of <em>everyone</em> in your two favourite subjects, Arithmacy and Charms, and the professors love you."</p><p>"Black…"</p><p>Sirius's voice, which had been energetic and prideful, softened. His grey eyes which were stormy, melted into a soft dove grey instead and his shoulders relaxed, curling just a bit.</p><p>"And - and I know you don't like my attention," he continued</p><p>Hermione's ire at the teen began to dissipate slowly, like a smothered fire with only tendrils of smoke softly wafting through the air.</p><p>Sirius finally looked away. "But even though all you saw was me shouting at you - trying to get your attention - I watched you all the time."</p><p>Potter snorted, and Hermione cut her eyes to him. He nodded emphatically and mouthed, <em>"All. The. Time."</em></p><p>"And I saw you with Crouch," continued Sirius, bitterness and guilt creeping into his voice. "And - and Reggie."</p><p>Hermione sighed. <em>And… </em>there<em> goes the last remains of anger I had towards him</em>. She took a deep breath and remembered the man he would become with twelve years of Azkaban and guilt behind him. She softened her tone. "You have the capacity for great love - I've seen it with your friends. You can be an amazing person, a true Gryffindor: strong, brave, chivalrous."</p><p>Both Sirius and Potter were staring at her now.</p><p>"But to be those things, for the love of all things holy, I swear to God," sighed a very exasperated Hermione, "<em>grow up</em>."</p><p>"What?" squeaked Sirius, his voice high. He cleared his throat.</p><p>"You heard me," said Hermione, sending Sirius a rather dry look. "If you want to talk to your brother, <em>go talk to him</em>. You don't need to pretend to be interested in <em>me</em> to do that, especially just because I have an <em>in</em> with the Slytherins. He's your <em>brother</em>."</p><p>Sirius's mouth dropped open and then it closed, leaving him gaping like a fish out of water for a bit. "I-"</p><p>A part of Hermione was desperately upset at the fact that Sirius was using her to talk to Regulus; but another part of her understood. She, Harry, and Ron got to know the younger Black brother through his heroic and suicidal deed of stealing the locket Horcrux, and even Kreacher could be convinced to share a few stories of the Slytherin on particular maudlin days post-war. The three of them ended up admiring the young man who died at eighteen - barely four years from now in this timeline - and Hermione could understand the pressure that Sirius was under to avoid his brother while wanting to keep an eye out for him. Finding a link between the two - <em>her</em> - as a go-between was smart.</p><p>But damn if it didn't hurt just a bit. What she doomed to be a second thought by <em>all</em> men? The hot taste of bile rose in her throat and her stomach rolled.</p><p>With her hands trembling, Hermione turned to Potter, and said, "I'm sorry - I can't do this tonight. We can meet up later to go over things if you want, but I can't stay here."</p><p>She gathered up her things, shoving them in her bag. She was caught in a series of memories as they flashed by; leaving her confused and despondent - where was the man she would know in him? She barely recognized him between the malicious glee in his pranks, or the casual disregard for people's feelings. Where was the man that stood up for his godson? The man who would sit and stare in the bottom of a glass and recognize and realize his past mistakes and tried to atone for them?</p><p>"Hermione."</p><p>Hermione looked up at the gentle calling of her name. She blinked furiously a few times, as Sirius's face was swimming - were those tears in her eyes? The teen had a hand stretched out towards her but it failed to touch. There was a wry smile on his face - a twisted, bitter thing - and the shock of something familiar from <em>her</em> Sirius had Hermione freeze.</p><p>"I'm sorry," he continued. "I don't say that often, so treasure that, okay, Princess? I'm the one who crashed the tutoring session - twice now. I'm leaving. I won't bother you again."</p><p>"Padfoot?" murmured a surprised Potter, who had remained frozen in his seat, but watching the two, thinking another punch was well on its way.</p><p>Sirius turned to his friend and muttered something too low for her to hear. Slowly, Potter nodded, his hazel eyes slipping from his friend to Hermione, standing at the table with her chair pushed back behind her.</p><p>The other Gryffindor paused, just for a moment, and then said quietly, "It wasn't just because of Reggie, Princess," and then disappeared behind a tall stack, his steps muted against the wood and turning light as they were swallowed by the other ambient noise of the library.</p><p>She was still standing seconds later, frozen. Potter was looking at her with worried eyes. "You alright, Hermione? We can pick this up later, if you want. We don't need to continue."</p><p>She blinked at him; taking in what he just said that. Slowly, she sat, eyes on her hands, willing them to stop trembling with nerves.</p><p>Potter didn't say anything as she slowly unpacked her notes and quills and ink, nor did he speak when she handed over his graded revision. Instead, she slowly began speaking about integers, almost haltingly. But Potter listened, nodded, and only asked her a question when he needed it. Otherwise, it was the quietest tutoring session that ever had.<br />And when he left, before her, he stopped at the side of her chair. He looked down, she looked up, and he tentatively rested his hand on her shoulder - for a single, breathless moment - and then was gone.</p><p><em>Huh</em>, thought Hermione. <em>Maybe there actually is a bit of Harry in there to see.</em></p><hr /><p>True to his word, Sirius didn't bother her again. He was no longer shouting Shakespearean love lines at her, nor was he appearing wherever she was, much to Barty's pleasure. Rumours of Hermione turning him down one too many times meant that people shifted their attention from her to the (obviously) heartbroken Sirius Black, who suddenly had an influx of dates for the last Hogsmeade weekend before Yule break.</p><p>With a sigh of relief, Hermione was once more - <em>partially </em>- invisible. Kind of anyway, because every so often, she would feel someone's eyes burn into her back, which faced the Gryffindor table. She never turned around to check who it was - she knew it wasn't Lily, because her sister would just come and sit with her if she wanted to sit and talk and she was the type to pull <em>everything</em> out after cornering them - and Barty never sat opposite from Hermione to check, either. The only one facing the Gryffindor table was Regulus, and despite the assessing grey eyes and the cool smirk on his face, he didn't tell her who it was, either.</p><p>(But she had her guesses.)</p><p>Slowly, equilibrium was achieved, and a month after the disastrous morning of November's Hogsmeade weekend, at the start of December's, Hermione felt that <em>this</em> was how it was supposed to go: her, in Muggle clothes with an open Advanced Transfiguration text, next to Barty, planning their London outings over the break, and conspiring on how to sneak Regulus away from another Yule party with his family.</p><p>"-I heard that there was going to be an amazing New Years' bash," Barty was saying, quickly shovelling in bites of his breakfast for their full day out. She listened fondly to his exuberant voice. "From Elliott Smith? Remember him? Hufflepuff, a year up, and we met him as we were leaving the Leaky in the summer. He was also at Amos Diggory's 1974 'do and said that the man is going to host another this year. <em>Full</em> Muggle, at some pub in the middle of nowhere. What do you say, Hermione? Hmm? Let's?"</p><p>"Are we formally invited or crashing?" she asked patiently, shutting the book and slipping it into her book bag.</p><p>"Oh, crashing," nodded Barty emphatically, eyes wide with mischief. "Definitely. We'll bring Reg, too." He paused, tilting his head to the side. "Have you got his gift yet? For Yule?"</p><p>Hermione gave Barty some side-eye and a quirk of her lips. "What makes you think I have <em>yours</em>?"</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, and then let out a laugh. An arm stretched out and around her shoulder, hauling her into his side tightly. He leaned his chin on her bushy head, and Hermione - fully taking advantage of (not-)Harry's advice to live her life, to make her own decisions as though nothing could mess up the timeline, and leaned back in to her friend.</p><p>"I don't know what happened," whispered Barty quietly in her ear, his voice low, "But I like this you. You've changed - since you started tutoring Potter, and even after that Black nonsense. Whatever it is - don't let yourself go back to how you were before."</p><p>"I won't," she promised quietly, snaking her own arm around his back and squeezing.</p><p>They sat in silence for a bit, and then, as students slowly filtered from the Hall to the Clock Tower, Hermione and Barty joined them waiting in line for a carriage. Regulus slithered up at one point, dressed impeccably in his pressed trousers and cloak, his black, curly hair a mop on his head but artfully styled.</p><p>"Morning," he said, the words crisps and clear in his rounded Pureblood tones. "Where to, first?"</p><p>The three exchanged glances as they moved up several spots.</p><p>"Honeydukes?" suggested Barty, naming his favourite shop.</p><p>Hermione eyed him fondly. "Have you already gone through your stash?"</p><p>Regulus snickered behind a hand as Barty pouted. "You say that like it's a <em>bad</em> thing! Besides, you just want to visit Scrivenshaft's for a new quill - that's the, what? <em>Fourth </em>you've broken since beginning to tutor Potter?"</p><p>Hermione's amusement disappeared quickly and she scowled at her friend, while Regulus's snickers grew louder.</p><p>They were at the head of the queue, and then in one of the (not so) horseless carriages. Easy conversation flowed between the three, with Hermione relaxing into the hard black leather of the carriage's seats, until they were through the gate and at the Hogsmeade station.</p><p>Between Honeydukes, Scrivenshaft's, and Zonko's, they made quick work of any shopping desires, and Hermione even had time to slip away from the two males to get their Yule cards and to place the final touches on their presents.</p><p>By noon, their stomachs were growling and they laughingly entered the Three Broomsticks, which was noisy and loud, as several others had the same thought as they did. However, Regulus's keen eyes found them a booth tucked in the far corner, the furthest from the door along the front by the window, so that they could gossip and window watch.</p><p>It wasn't until they were done their meal that Hermione realized the group of teens sitting nearby, one in particular who kept glancing over, thinking he was subtle. When Hermione finally caught the grey eyes, she quirked an eyebrow.</p><p>The teen sighed, and muttered something to his friends, shoving his hands into the pockets of the leather jacket he wore, and he slouched and strode over, around discarded seats and a few knapsacks on the sticky floor.</p><p>Hermione watched his progress until he was standing at their table, shifting uncomfortably as he waited to be noticed. The conversation between Barty and Regulus trailed off, with Barty glaring at the Gryffindor teen hotly.</p><p>Barty was slowly reaching for one of his last chips, never taking his eyes off Sirius as he brought it to his mouth and began munching on the soggy potato. Sirius grimaced but nodded at him, as well. "Crouch." His voice was significantly warmer when he turned to Hermione. "Evans." His eyes then turned to the teen sitting across from Hermione and Barty.</p><p>Regulus stared coolly at his brother. "Sirius."</p><p>Sirius shuffled a bit and nodded, sharply, once. "Reg."</p><p>Regulus leaned back in the seat, adopting a very carefree and relaxed pose. "What brings you to our table?"</p><p>"I - ah - I -" Sirius flicked his eyes over at Hermione, almost in desperation as something close to panic and annoyance crossed his face, shortly. Then he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. When he opened them, determination was writ on his face.</p><p>"I'm staying at the Potters for Yule, Reg. I wasn't sure if I would see you again before school starts back up in January, so…" he trailed off, sighing loudly and glancing away. A nervous hand ran through his hair. Finally, he shrugged, and withdrew a small package from his leather jacket pockets.</p><p>Hermione watched as he made an aborted motion - first to almost toss the item carelessly onto their dirty tabletop - but then he gently placed it before his brother. "Happy Yule, Reggie."</p><p>Regulus stared hard at the gift for several moments. From her position - and Barty's as well - they could see the emotions flit across his face: shock, suspicion, annoyance, and then finally, resigned acceptance and a bit of fondness.</p><p>The younger Black reached for the gift and drew it close to him. "It's not going to blow up in my face, is it?"</p><p>Sirius barked out a laugh. It was so eerily familiar Hermione startled a bit. "No. No, Reg, it's not - I swear on my honour as a Marauder that it's not a prank."</p><p>"Hmm," replied Regulus, but he carefully placed the gift in the pockets of his own cloak. When he looked up at his elder brother, his own grey eyes were bright. "My thanks. Happy Yule, Sirius."</p><p>Sirius bobbed his head in a strange sort of not-quite-a-nod at his brother and Barty, who had his eyes narrowed, and then turned to Hermione. "No sonnets this time, Princess."</p><p>"Oh?" Hermione's own eyes narrowed and she leaned back in her seat, but unlike Regulus's cool look, she crossed her arms combatively.</p><p>Sirius shook his head. "Just -" he paused, his head cocked slightly to the side as though he was listening to something else. "Just, <em>thanks</em>."</p><p>He then turned and stalked back through the busy room of the Three Broomsticks, until his friends who crowded him, speaking all at once, and then they were gone, through the door with a cold blast of December air.</p><p>"What just happened?" asked Barty eventually, dragging his last chip through the leftover ketchup. He began to draw patterns that Hermione recognized as Arithmacy equations.</p><p>Hermione turned to look at Barty and then past him, out the window. Through the thick glass, she spotted twin blurry black heads crowd together with two sandy blonds.</p><p>"I think we just witnessed Sirius Black growing up," she said with a small grin on her lips. At Barty's look of horror, she laughed.</p><p>And across from them, Regulus leaned back in his seat, a small, contented smile on his lips as he hand, under the table, turned over the small gift in his pocket, again and again, reassuring himself it was still there.</p><hr /><p align="center">

  <strong>December 1975</strong>
</p><p>The worst thing about travelling on the Hogwarts Express back to London for the holidays was the fact that Hermione's (new? Second? whatever.) parents lived in Yorkshire.</p><p>After leaving Hogwarts in the morning, they'd arrive sometime early afternoon. Disembarking, saying goodbye to friends (when one was Lily; Hermione didn't have many friends), collecting their trunks, and then making their way surreptitiously through Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, purchasing their train tickets, the inevitable wait, and then the four-hour train ride north… it was past dinner when they arrived in Hull.</p><p>Leo Evans was waiting for his daughters at the ASDA parking lot adjacent to the train station in his car, window cracked as he smoked and read a newspaper by the light of a streetlamp.</p><p>"Hello girls!" he greeted his daughters when he spotted them coming over the metal bridge, exiting the car and greeting Lily first with a tight hug. The redhead laughed happily, dropping her trunk and squeezing their father back tightly.</p><p>"Daddy!"</p><p>Then Leo turned to Hermione. "Hello, sweetheart," he said, and gently, tentatively, reached for Hermione to draw her into a careful hug.</p><p>Stunned, Hermione could only think, <em>have I truly been that closed off to everyone, including my own family in this time?</em> Resolved, after her talk with not-Harry, Hermione reached around her father and tightly hugged him back.</p><p>The man exhaled loudly and brought a hand up to cup the back of Hermione's bushy curls. "Oh, my little Queen…"</p><p>Hermione's eyes burned and she furiously blinked back tears. She sniffed as she withdrew from the hug and saw her father's eyes were shining a bit brightly in the streetlamp. He cleared his throat and roughly said, "Let's get your trunks into the boot then, shall we? Rose has a stew on for you both."</p><p>Lily clambered into the front seat next to her father, chattering away of the fall semester with all the spells they were learning and the latest gossip from Gryffindor. Hermione, quietly, settled in the back, letting Lily take the spotlight.</p><p>It was habitual, but something was different this time: Leo glanced at his youngest daughter in the rear-view mirror and smiled.</p><p>This time, instead of pulling out a book to read or turning away from the look to stare out at the un/familiar hometown, Hermione smiled back.</p><p>A few days later, Hermione's eyes followed the confident forms of her mother and Lily as they effortlessly moved from one part of the kitchen to the other. She leaned against the wall at the kitchen entrance, eyes moving back and forth, as Lily stirred something on the stovetop, and her mother chopped vegetables at the counter.</p><p>"Is there anything I can do to help?" asked Hermione eventually, despite the cramped space. She wanted to add something to the family dinner, even if it was just taking the roast from the oven.</p><p>"Oh, no, love," said Rose, flashing a smile at her youngest. "Lily and I have everything in hand here."</p><p>"Thanks anyway!" piped up Lily from the stove, grinning. "Why don't you go back to the living room and read?"</p><p><em>Ouch</em>, thought Hermione, although it was without much bite. Suddenly she was wondering if others in her previous life dismissed her as someone that they thought would prefer books to human interaction. To be fair, they weren't wrong per se, but -</p><p>Hermione sighed and turned, only to bump into Petunia who had crept up behind her. Her eldest sister's long face softened from the scowl she had been wearing, and her green eyes flickered between the kitchen and Hermione.</p><p>"Daddy's snoring in his chair," said Petunia. "I could use some help finishing the decorations on the tree."</p><p>Brightening, Hermione followed Petunia to their living room at the front of the house, and together, the two pulled out ornaments and foil from storage boxes. The two didn't speak as they decorated the tree, but Hermione had a smile on her face as she contributed to her family's tradition, something she had never done before.</p><p>Every so often, she'd feel Petunia's eyes on her, and when she'd glance up, Petunia was resolutely looking elsewhere. But as the evening progressed, and by the time Rose shouted, "dinner!" and Leo awoke with a snort from his nap, Petunia's face had softened and there was even a small smile on her lips.</p><hr /><p>Christmas Day was spent at the church in the morning, and then home for a late, large family lunch that included Leo's parents - their paternal grandparents - and their paternal uncle at their house. The dining table sat a very cramped eight, and when they were younger, Lily also had invited Severus Snape over; making an even more cramped nine at the table. As it stood, eight was enough for them, and the two girls attending Hogwarts didn't have to carefully school Snape in how to act or what to say around their extended muggle family.</p><p>They began their Christmas tradition with their lunch, and their grandparents Humphrey and Marie Evans, asking the girls about school. Hogwarts was a bit wishy-washy on what they thought of 'immediate family,' usually limiting it to the parents of magical children only in the muggle world, but their father's family in close proximity and the accidental witnessing of Lily once changing the patterns on their grandmother's favourite tea set during a birthday celebration, they were brought into the fold.</p><p>Rose began to enthuse about Petunia's latest grades and how her A-levels were going. "-and Pet has some of the highest grades in her English class!"</p><p>"That's wonderful, dear," said their grandmother, reaching over from beside Petunia to pat her on her arm. There was a grimace of distaste when she turned to the other two. "And how are things going at your - <em>boarding</em> school, girls?"</p><p>Lily immediately bloomed, her face animated as she gave a play-by-play of her courses, her OWL prep, and some anecdotes of her fellow Gryffindor dorm mates. Hermione let her sister's voice wash over her as she ate her vegetables and roast silently, her thoughts focused inward on the letter she needed to send to Barty to coordinate their New Years' plans of crashing Amos Diggory's party, and how they were going to sneak Regulus away, when Lily's voice permeated her mind.</p><p>"-punched Sirius Black in the face! In the <em>library</em>," finished Lily, her voice dropping on the last word.</p><p>Hermione's head popped up from looking at her plate to see the various looks her family members were giving her. Petunia looked horrified, as did her mother and grandmother, while her father and uncle seemed torn between bemused and affronted.</p><p>"Whatever did this Black boy do to you, Hermione?" asked her grandfather.</p><p>She shot a nasty glare at Lily, who shrugged back. Hesitantly, Hermione answered, "... he interrupted a tutoring session I was giving his best friend."</p><p>"Sirius Black… Sirius Black," mused Rose, tapping a finger to her lips. "He's best friends with James Potter? That boy that you're complaining about, Lily? The one that fancies you?"</p><p>Lily turned a shade of red that didn't compliment her hair colour. "He's a toe rag," she muttered. "He's cruel and plays terrible pranks on Severus."</p><p>Both Petunia and Hermione rolled their eyes; although Petunia's response was because she disliked Snape in general, for Hermione, it was because she knew the Slytherin gave as good as he received. Neither were innocent in their hexing of one another.</p><p>"And you're tutoring him, Hermione, dear?" asked Rose, a frown on her face. "Is Potter bothering you, too?"</p><p>Hermione shook his head. "No - that was Black. After I punched him, I recited some Shakespeare - a mistake, in hindsight - and then he spent two weeks following me around, shouting sonnets at me."</p><p>Her uncle laughed into his napkin. "Well, that's better than the proposal Lily got."</p><p>Lily sent her uncle a nasty look at the memory of James Potter shouting his intent to marry her in their second year. She had loudly complained about it when she returned home for Christmas.</p><p>"In my day, we didn't need to shout things at the young ladies we were interested in," grumbled Humphrey, turning to face his wife, who smiled back at him. "We gave the woman we courted every courtesy she deserved, by being attentive to her needs, kind, and respectful."</p><p>Marie patted her husband on his arm, as she had Petunia but this time it was slightly patronizing. "And yet I remember you chasing me down from one dance hall to the next with my girlfriends, seeking my time."</p><p>Hermione's grandfather flushed.</p><p>"Should we worry about this Black?" asked Leo, worriedly.</p><p>His brother snorted. "Leonard. Please. If Hermione's going around smacking him and he's following her around afterward, I think she can handle herself."</p><p>Hermione blushed at the insinuation and Petunia stifled a gasp while Lily snickered into her roast beef. "It's fine, we don't need to worry!" she yelped. "He only wanted to talk to his brother and thought to go through me was a fine idea."</p><p>Now, her grandfather and uncle scowled. "What?"</p><p>Hermione shrugged, unconcernedly, while moving some cut pieces of food around her face, twirling her fork. "It's fine. I don't have time for boys, anyway. Besides, I'm only fourteen."</p><p>There was a brief moment of silence, and then Lily jumped in, "What Hermione isn't saying here is that our charms and arithmancy professors think she'll write her end of school exams in those subjects this year! Who needs boys when she's a little brainy monster!"</p><p>And amidst all the clamour of her grades, the praise that heaped upon her from her family, Hermione offered a few thin, tight smiles that never quite reached her eyes.</p><hr /><p>Petunia came to check on her a week later, on New Years' Eve. Hermione was in her bedroom, the one she shared with Lily, as they were the closest in age (and it made sense keeping all the magic stuff in one, contained, area). Lily was downstairs, drinking cider with their parents in the living room as they watched a programme on the BBC. Petunia was the last to get ready for their NYE outing to the local.</p><p>Her eldest sister knocked on her slightly ajar door and pushed it opened. "Hermione?"</p><p>Hermione looked up from the book she was reading on her bed, cross-legged. "Tuney?"</p><p>Biting her lip, the blonde entered the room and her eyes darted this way and that as she took in the pile of magical texts on Hermione's desk, or the sleeping owl near Lily's bed, with a wing covering its face.</p><p>Petunia tentatively sat on the very edge of Hermione's bed. "Are you sure you want to stay in tonight?"</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "I think I'll be fine."</p><p>"Well, it's just that-" Petunia paused. "Sean has a few friends coming tonight as well, if you wanted to meet any of them…?</p><p><em>Sean?</em> thought Hermione, frowning as she tried to recognize the name. <em>Who's that?</em></p><p>Petunia must have read her face because she gave a tight smile. "That's right; you weren't around when I was telling mum and daddy about him. He's my boyfriend."</p><p>"The rugby player from Cokeworth Secondary?" asked Hermione, thinking back to a brief conversation she had walked on in earlier during the holidays.</p><p>Petunia's face lit up and her smile smoothed out. "Yes! Anyway - Sean has some friends coming tonight. I know mum and daddy will be there too, but, they won't be everywhere…?"</p><p>"Tuney," began an incredulous Hermione, "Are you - are you trying to set me up on a date?"</p><p>A rosy blush covered Petunia's fair skin. She looked away and began playing with a loose thread on her cardigan. "It's just that - at dinner that night - you seemed - about that - that <em>boy</em> at your… your <em>school</em>-"</p><p>Hermione felt her heart swell. Petunia never liked it when Lily went on about Hogwarts, not since she first attended; but Hermione knew that was due to the way Lily crowed about her life there, and Petunia felt like Lily was leaving her behind. By association, Hermione was part of that, but since she never engaged with her family in general, Petunia had less animosity towards her silent and closed off sister. The fact that Petunia had even decided to bring up the conversation about a wizard and Hogwarts - even obliquely - was huge.</p><p>"I'm not interested in Sirius," replied Hermione calmly, closing her book and setting it aside.</p><p>"But you want him to be…?" asked Petunia.</p><p>Hermione laughed. "No. Not at all. I think one day he might be a friend, but he's not grown-up enough for me."</p><p>Petunia nodded. "You are fourteen, going on forty."</p><p><em>You have no idea</em>, thought Hermione in amusement. "School is enough for me right now, Tuney. And I have my friends."</p><p>Both girls looked over at her desk, where a single framed photo of her, Barty, and Regulus was displayed in a glittery frame.</p><p>"In fact," continued Hermione, almost fondly, "That black-haired boy? That's Sirius's younger brother. They don't talk much, being in different Houses at Hogwarts, so Sirius used me to bridge that gap."</p><p>Petunia nodded, slowly, but Hermione wasn't sure her elder sister understood. "Anyway - don't tell mum or dad, but I've got plans tonight."</p><p>Eyes lit up at the source of new gossip. "What?"</p><p>Hermione grinned conspiratorially. "I'm meeting with Barty and Reg later and we're going to crash a party. We've been planning it awhile now."</p><p>Petunia's mouth dropped open. She leaned forward, eyes wide. "<em>Really?</em>"</p><p>Hermione nodded.</p><p>"Wow," breathed Petunia, leaning back. She eyed her sister like she had never seen her before. "You will be safe, won't you? You won't have to chase away any slobbering boys from assaulting you, will you?"</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "Oh please. Reg wouldn't kiss me - he's too much a Pureblood for that. I swear, he thinks I have cooties or something. And Barty sees me as a sister."</p><p>"Mmm," replied Petunia, unconvinced.</p><p>"Oh, honestly, Tuney. As if someone will kiss me at midnight. Don't you know? I'm the know-it-all loner bookworm."</p><hr /><p>Despite the more <em>sympathetic</em> ideologies the Potter kept towards what the majority of Society thought as 'blood traitors,' 'mudbloods' and 'squib riffraff,' they were still in good enough standing to be invited to a large amount of galas, parties, soirees, and - most importantly - the New Years' Ball, this year hosted by the Greengrass family.</p><p>Luckily, as Pureblood society deemed those under seventeen to not be legally adults in their world, the "children" were sectioned off from much of the main party where the adults mingled and subtly insult one another based on their looks, financial status, politics, ., until the clock would strike midnight; the children, on the other hand, ranging from eleven to sixteen, were in a different set of rooms.</p><p>Except for Sirius and James, of course.</p><p>It was just gone nine-thirty, and the two fifteen-year-olds had snuck out from the children's room under the cover of a loud prank (something involving dungbombs, Augustine Selwyn, and the punch bowl). Outside, with warming charms cast on themselves to starve off the chill from the December air, they leaned against the rough brick of the old manor home, pressed tightly to the wall to keep to the shadows in case a nosy adult, or house elf, went looking for them. They kept well out of sight from the gas-lit hanging wall sconces, finding the perfect dark spot between two.</p><p>Backs against the brick, they stood on a small cement verandah with a heavy matching balustrade that separated the patio from the well-tended garden and gravel path towards the hothouse. From there, they surveyed the expansive Greengrass gardens and the large hothouse adjacent to the property, filled with exotic and rare specimens, below them. Parallel to the hothouse was a large hedgerow maze, with a large fountain at its center that James and Sirius knew intimately from when the Greengrasses held a summer gala a few years ago.</p><p>Sirius dug out a small flask from his dress robe pocket - stylishly mimicking a Muggle cutaway coat much to his mother's ire - and shook it a bit, as he offered it to his friend. "Firewhiskey?"</p><p>James reached out and took a swig. Both had been sneaking sips of the whiskey and as James swallowed, it was with minimal eye watering. Sirius grinned, his teeth shining white in the dark.</p><p>"Here's to them wiz," toasted Sirius, taking the flask back and raising it briefly. "Prejudiced racist snots the lot of them, but damn do they make good alcohol."</p><p>The two snickered, shoving back and forth at one another as they snuck sips of the warm liquid.</p><p>"New year, new goals," said Sirius at one point, buzzed but nowhere near sloshed. "Still planning on your never-ending, not-going-anywhere quest to woo fair Lily as we enter 1976?"</p><p>James rolled his eyes. "It's going! She talks to me now."</p><p>Sirius gave him a bland stare. "Yeah, Prongs. To complain about how you treat Hermione."</p><p>"She does not!" he bristled.</p><p>"Yeah? Tell me one time where you two had a decent conversation."</p><p>"Well - uh… that is -" At Sirius's stare, he wilted. "I can't remember. But I'm sure we've had at least <em>one</em>!"</p><p>"Maybe back in first year, before she knew what a tosser you were," laughed Sirius, taking the sting out of his words with a grin and nudge.</p><p>James morosely sighed. "What am I doing wrong, Pads? I like to think I'm a good catch of a wizard."</p><p>"Right you are, Jimmy-boy," agreed Sirius, nodding. He leaned back and eyed his best friend from head to toe, leering outrageously. "Why, you're handsome - not as handsome as <em>me</em>, though - and wicked clever with Transfiguration, and funny to boot! What isn't there to like?"</p><p>James grinned back at his friend.</p><p>"Why," continued Sirius loftily, "I think even at a push we could say that the younger Miss Evans doesn't mind you, and isn't that saying something?"</p><p>The Potter heir chuckled. "Hermione is a bit of a prickly one, isn't she?"</p><p>"Wet nundu," nodded Sirius sagely.</p><p>"She must have kept to herself for most of her time at Hogwarts," mused aloud James, tilting his head up to look at the wide range of stars that spread across the inky sky above them. "Given that I never knew she existed at all before she began tutoring me."</p><p>Sirius copied his position, leaning bodily against James so that they were touching from shoulder to hip to leg, one giant shadowy mass hidden against the manor's bricks. "You'd think <em>I'd</em> have noticed her. I mean -" he broke off and coughed at the glare James sent him. "<em>I meant</em>, Potter - get your head out of the gutter - that she knows Reg. I'd have noticed if she hung out around him often. But I never did. But they're close enough that he pals around with her and that Crouch kid."</p><p>"She's pretty talented with magic, too," added James quietly. "But I don't hear the Professors singing her praises like they do Lily's."</p><p>"She's more of a wallflower type, I suppose," sighed Sirius, bringing the flask up with the arm that wasn't pressed against his friend. He took a sip. "But does she <em>ever</em> have a temper!"</p><p>"Yeah, she socked you <em>good</em>," laughed James, thinking back to the library event.</p><p>"Yeah," agreed Sirius, a goofy grin on his face. "Gotta admire a broad like that. I don't think anyone's hit me like that since Reggie did last year after the Quidditch final!"</p><p>"Speaking of your brother…" James nudged Sirius back, tilting his chin down and jerking it towards the garden below them.</p><p>"Wha…?"</p><p>Together, the two Gryffindors leaned forward, peering into the dark. Below, they made out a lean figure edge their way along the gravel path, skirting the edges nearest to the waist-height bushes that lined it. When they reached the entrance to the maze, the figure hugged along the taller hedge until they slipped around the corner.</p><p>Immediately, Sirius tucked the flask into his pocket in one move while bounding forward and leaping over the thick balustrade, using it to leapfrog, and landed near silently on his boots in the dewy grass. James scrambled to follow.</p><p>"<em>Sirius</em>!" he hissed, but his best friend was already halfway down the gravel path, and by the time he caught up with him, Sirius was peering around the hedge.</p><p>Without taking his eyes off his brother, Sirius muttered, "He's going 'round the hothouses and towards the back gate of the property. Where are you going, little brother?"</p><p>The two snuck across the grounds, slightly hunched over until they were at the edge of the hothouse. They both peered around and saw Regulus glance back, making them duck. Sirius swore.</p><p>When they looked again, Regulus was at the gate, looking up at the heavy cement column that bracketed the swinging metal.</p><p>"C'mon, Prongs!" Sirius grabbed James' sleeve. "He's probably going to climb the thing and when he does, we'll lose him on the other side! Let's go!"</p><p>"Where - do - you - think - he's - going?" panted James as they darted across the grounds.</p><p>Sirius shrugged, tossing his wavy hair. "Who knows? But the fact that my perfect baby brother is skipping out on the New Year's party that <em>I know for a fact</em> my mother wanted him to attend makes this all the more interesting!"</p><p>Regulus was, by the time they were two meters away, clambering up the cement block and was pushing himself up on the flat top.</p><p>"Oh, little brother!" called Sirius gleefully. "What <em>are</em> you doing?"</p><p>On top of the flat column, Regulus glanced back and winced at the sight of his brother and his brother's best friend. He sighed. "Go <em>away</em>, Sirius."</p><p>"Not gonna happen," replied Sirius flatly, eyeing his brother as he perched on the column. "Just where are you going, Reggie? Because I find it really unbelievable that <em>you</em> of all people would sneak out from a soiree from under mother's nose."</p><p>James could visibly see the strain from Regulus as he bit his lip - a strangely obvious slip from the Slytherin with his naked emotional response. Finally, Regulus's shoulders hunched.</p><p>"What do you want, Sirius?"</p><p>Sirius, in response, rocked back on his heels. "I want to know where you're going!"</p><p>Something flashed in Regulus's eyes - as though he was contemplating what it was worth to lie versus telling the truth - but then he muttered, "New Years' party."</p><p>James frowned. "But you're at one now."</p><p>Regulus rolled his eyes. "Not the one I'd prefer to be at."</p><p>"A party filled with your slimy Slytherin friends?" sneered Sirius, guessing where his brother was heading out to. "At some private Pureblood daddy's summer house?"</p><p>"... No," replied Regulus slowly. "If you must know, it's a Hufflepuff who's hosting."</p><p>James blinked and Sirius's rock back took him so far he actually stumbled. "What?" the Black heir stuttered.</p><p>"Look, I'm going to be late enough as it is, and I don't want to miss more than I already have," sighed Regulus. "So, I'm leaving now and I would prefer if you kept this between us and didn't tell mother."</p><p>There was a glint in Sirius's eyes as he leaned forward. James stifled a groan. "What's it worth?"</p><p>This time, Regulus did groan. "Sirius, <em>please</em>. I'm going now!"</p><p>"Oh, yeah, you are," grinned Sirius, "And so are we. C'mon, Prongsie! We're escorting my little brother to this party. A <em>'Puff</em>! Ha! What do you take me for, a fool?"</p><hr /><p>"Famous last words, Sirius," muttered Regulus twenty minutes later, as the Slytherin and two Gryffindors stood in the middle of Ottery St. Catchpole, a tiny muggle town.</p><p>The town boasted a post office, a small grocer's, a butcher's, two churches, a social club, and three pubs. The furthest pub from the center of town, the Beaver and the Dam, was where the three ended up, following the raucous laughter and brightly dressed wizards and witches in magenta and pink and yellow robes commandeered the premises, much to the confusion of the few muggles at the pub.</p><p>James sent a commiserating look to his best friend. "He's got you there, Pads."</p><p>"It - it's a New Years' bash," stuttered Sirius in shock, grey eyes darting around. "You weren't joking about it!"</p><p>Regulus sent him a nasty look. "<em>I</em> don't joke around."</p><p>With that said, he strode forward and into the pub, leaving James and Sirius to scramble after him. Inside, it was loud with music crashing through several speakers, and behind the bar, they could see Amos Diggory, a Hufflepuff who graduated several years ago. The man was laughing and using his wand to make bottles float as he attempted some sort of mixed drink.</p><p>The pub itself was crowded; several people were in standing-only room, as the booths and tables were full with a cluster of Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, and some Slytherins. Both Sirius and James immediately noted that there were no Gryffindors.</p><p>"Jimmy!" shouted Sirius over the ambient noise, eyes wide. "How the hell did my brother know about this party? And where did he go?"</p><p>James just shook his head, eyes wide behind his glasses as well, as they picked out some familiar halfbloods and muggleborns that he recognized from school - and then his eyes stopped.</p><p>"I've found him," replied James.</p><p>Sirius spun and asked, "Where?" following James's line of sight, and then his mouth dropped open.</p><p>In a dark corner, Regulus was standing with a drink in his hand - <em>a </em>muggle <em>drink</em>, Sirius's brain supplied as it shorted out - and happily chatting with none other than Barty Crouch and Hermione Evans.</p><p>"Did - did my brother sneak out of a Pureblood party to hang out with his friends in a muggle pub?" asked a rather lightheaded Sirius as he reached forward and heavily clutched at James's shoulder.</p><p>His best friend merely nodded.</p><p>Slowly, a grin spread across Sirius's face. James could easily see what he was thinking: that Regulus wasn't a lost cause at all. <em>"That's my little brother!"</em> Sirius cried, and then began heading towards the small group.</p><p>James sighed and followed.</p><hr /><p>Since Leo and Rose Evans were used to Hermione's rather antisocial ways, as well as her disappearing acts over the years, they thought little of her skipping out of the Evans family New Year's celebrations, as she did that all the time. Her Evans parents instead decided to join Petunia and her boyfriend - not Vernon Dursley just yet, but the barrel-chested Sean from Cokeworth Secondary - and his parents at the local, and Lily decided to join them, as Severus Snape decided to remain at Hogwarts.</p><p>Hermione was sure that everyone thought she'd be at home the entire night, curled up with a book, but twenty minutes after they left (including a very obvious wink from Petunia as she loudly stated they were leaving now, <em>bye Hermione</em>!), Hermione had changed into something a bit dressier (wide trousers with a sleeveless blouse she tucked into the high waist of the pants), grabbed a coat, and then held her wand aloft to summon the Knight Bus.</p><p>Then she was meeting Barty at the Leaky where he joined her, and then they were speeding to Ottery St. Catchpole, where Hermione was visiting for the first time in this timeline and <em>not</em> seeing the Weasleys. That was odd.</p><p>Barty rubbed his hands gleefully. "Excited?"</p><p>Hermione cast him a glance. "To crash a Hufflepuff alum party? Sure."</p><p>"What's wrong?" asked Barty, frowning. "Did something happen at home? Did your sister say something to you?" His eyes widened. "Was it about Black? About you <em>punching</em> him? Or his endless following you around?" Barty's hand clenched into fists. "It's practically harassment! I can't believe McGonagall thought some of it was funny! Stupid Gryffindors."</p><p>"No, it wasn't that," explained Hermione patiently, instantly soothing Barty's ruffled feathers. But how to explain that, despite her change in attitude that Barty and Regulus so clearly saw in her, her own parents in this time, failed to recognize? Even Lily - who saw her every day at Hogwarts - seemed to think that Hermione was just as aloof as usual, preferring books to company.</p><p><em>How odd that it's Petunia who noticed my clumsy attempts at rejoining the family,</em> thought Hermione with a minor frown.</p><p>"Oi, stop it with that sad face," said Barty. "We're here, anyway. First pint's on me!"</p><p>Hermione joined her friend at the bar, shouted a greeting at Elliott Smith - the Hufflepuff they were on vaguely friendly terms with as he introduced them to a slightly drunk twenty-year-old Amos Diggory - and then retreated to a dark corner with their drinks and wait for Regulus.</p><p>"Did something happen at home?" asked Barty eventually, after their silence had gone on too long. He had finished his drink, had found a discarded can, and was working through that.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "It's fine."</p><p>"It's not if it's made you moody."</p><p>"I am not-!" the token protest turned into a sigh. Hermione put her half-finished drink down and ran her hands through her curls. "Alright, fine, yes. I made a promise to myself that I would… be more social and involved."</p><p>Barty eyed her strangely. "You have been."</p><p>"At home too," continued Hermione, "And while my father may have seen my attempts, the only person who seemed to realize what I was doing what my elder sister, Petunia."</p><p>"Wait - the mean one? The muggle?" Barty's face scrunched up as he tried to remember. "I thought she hated you and your sister."</p><p>"Apparently less so than I thought," sighed Hermione. "Anyway - listen, it's going to be a new year. We should celebrate all the amazing things we're going to do in 1976!"</p><p>Barty's eyes lit up. "Like cracking nonverbal spells!"</p><p>She picked up her drink and clinked it with his, sloshing their ale. "Like transmutation!"</p><p>"Like Calypso Fawcett saying yes to a date with me?"</p><p>The two spun to see Regulus standing by them; three drink in his hands and a grin on his face as he passed them around. Hermione groaned but took the offered drink, even if she wasn't done her first yet. "Oh, just give it up, Reggie. That girl's never going to say yes to you."</p><p>Barty nodded knowing, a slight sway as he mixed his drinks and took two chugs of the dark pint Regulus offered. "I suggest Belinda Smith."</p><p>"Smith?" an incredulous voice asked, and Hermione startled. She turned her head and saw the last two people she would ever expect to see come to stand with them in their small corner. Both were dressed completely out of character for the muggle pub, in fashionable wizard's robes, indicating that they had snuck from somewhere, just like Regulus; unlike them, however, Regulus took the time to transfigure his clothing.</p><p>Sirius Black was looking back and forth between Regulus, Barty, and Hermione. He finally turned to James. "Isn't she a Hufflepuff?"</p><p>Barty nodded emphatically. "She is!"</p><p>Regulus scowled. "What is wrong with you? Thinking I'd date a <em>Hufflepuff</em>?"</p><p>A passing by woman shot Regulus a nasty look and Barty sniggered into his pint, drowning the rest of the liquid.</p><p>Sirius patted his shoulder sympathetically while Regulus's scowl deepened.</p><p>"What's wrong with a Hufflepuff?" asked Hermione curiously. But here, all the boys, except Barty who was silently giggling to himself, made a face. "What?"</p><p>"It's just that -" began James, looking awkward and then shrugged his shoulders. "Smith <em>giggles</em> all the time."</p><p>"And her perfume makes me sneeze," added Sirius, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>Regulus nodded. "And her friends." He shuddered and then turned to Barty to give him stink eye. "Honestly, mate, why would you even <em>suggest</em> that?"</p><p>A tiny spark of chaotic glee lit Barty's eyes. "That girl that passed by? The one earlier?"</p><p>"Yes…?" began a cautious Regulus.</p><p>"That was Belinda Smith's best friend; who also happens to be Calypso Fawcett's cousin," grinned Barty.</p><p>"God damn it, Barty!" barked Regulus, sounding more like Sirius at that moment. "Fuck! I need to find her and do damage control. I even bought a super expensive and proper Yule gift for Calypso to give to her when we return to school…"</p><p>Muttering, Regulus turned on his heel and stalked off.</p><p>Sirius, uncharacteristically silent, glanced between those remaining and then looking after his younger brother. "I think I'm going to go make sure he doesn't make things worse." He gave an apologetic look at James. "Sorry, mate."</p><p>James sighed.</p><p>"Barty," said Hermione seriously, "No more beer for you."</p><p>She reached out and plucked his empty glance from his hand while he giggled, trying to tug it back. "What? Hermione, <em>nooooo</em>."</p><p>James sighed. "Lightweight."</p><p>"Sorry," said Hermione, but it was slightly mocking. "We Ravenclaws don't pull out all the stops for our house parties like you Gryffindors do."</p><p>James mocked surprise, bringing a hand to his chest. "'Claws have <em>parties?</em> How ever do you find the time to be away from your precious books?"</p><p>Hermione snorted and rolled her eyes and Barty swayed.</p><p>"'Mione?" he muttered. "I don't feel so good."</p><p>"Jesus, Barty, you <em>are</em> a lightweight," admonished Hermione. "Don't embarrass me now in front of Potter. What happened to last summer when we finished that entire bottle of Odgen's at your lake house?"</p><p>Barty's face turned green at the memory. He shoved at James, who stumbled back as the younger teen pushed away from the crowd.</p><p>"<em>Annnnd</em> another one bites the dust," sighed Hermione.</p><p>"Oh!" said James, grinning, "That's clever."</p><p>Hermione frowned as she tried to think what he was referring to, and then audibly groaned. "And won't make sense for another four years."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "Never mind."</p><p>The two stood in silence for a bit, and Hermione wrestled with the urge to sigh and cast a <em>tempus</em> to know how close it was to midnight. This was <em>not</em> going how she thought her night would. Crashing Diggory's bash was boring without her friends.</p><p>"So. Um. Did you have a good Yule?"</p><p>Startled, Hermione turned back to James, who was awkwardly shifting from foot to foot. She eyed him for a moment but then said, slowly, "Yeah. It was fine."</p><p>"And your parents? And - elder sister, right?"</p><p>Hermione nodded again. "They're good."</p><p>"And Lily?"</p><p>"She's good, too," answered Hermione, watching James nervously look around. "And how was your Yule, Potter?"</p><p>"What? Oh. Um, it was... good," he finished lamely.</p><p>Hermione snorted and he closed his eyes in mortification.</p><p>"I'm sorry," he said, "I don't know why it's so easy to talk to you at school but here-"</p><p>"It's fine," replied Hermione automatically, but at the word, she caught James's hazel eyes and then they were both laughing. The tense air around them diffused.</p><p>The grin James gave her was decidedly lopsided. Hermione felt her breath catch - it was exactly the same as Harry's bashful, genuine smile. Her eyes went wide.</p><p>"So, what do you say?"</p><p>"I'm sorry, what?" blinked Hermione, having missed what James said first.</p><p>His lopsided smile stretched, and he ran a hand through his hair, messing it up further. "Want to dance?" he repeated.</p><p>Hermione looked at James, and then the packed pub floor where some had pushed tables and chairs aside for a makeshift dance floor.</p><p>"I-" she broke off and saw his face begin to fall and his chin duck down. "Okay."</p><p>His head popped up quickly, and that lopsided smile turned into a full grin. "Great! Okay! Right! Let's go!"</p><p>He grabbed her hand and pulled her through the crowd, where others were moving back and forth to the upbeat song. They both stood frozen for a moment, and then someone bumped into James and he stumbled into Hermione and then they were laughing and he was shifting back and forth.</p><p>He was a <em>terrible</em> dancer.</p><p>Hermione laughed loudly and then James was grinning at her. "What?" he shouted and then began swinging his arms back and forth in exaggerated moves to the upbeat disco beat. He did a little spin on his heels and she laughed again.</p><p>"You're ridiculous!" she shouted at him.</p><p>He wriggled his eyebrows and did another spin, his glasses nearly flying off his face as he went too fast. Hermione caught him as he stumbled to a stop, his hands coming up to rest on his glasses.</p><p>Somehow, they ended up remaining on the dance floor for a few more songs, James doing incredibly exaggerated, and sweeping steps that made people give them a wide berth, so Hermione followed along. She hadn't had this much fun dancing since the TriWizard tournament!</p><p>As the Hustle came on, James's eyebrows did another wriggle and then he was reaching for Hermione, his hand on hers and leading her through several perfect dance steps that were a mix of disco and the waltz.</p><p>There was a quick step, and then he turned her and they were back to back and she spun out again, laughing, until she was in front of him and he was behind her. She did the silliest move she remembered from television, dipping her finger across her body and up in the air while he did the same move behind her, but opposite.</p><p>They were gathering a crowd, and Hermione could spot the incredulous face of Regulus, staring at her with his mouth open. At his brother's side, Sirius had a drink and was cheering them on along with the crowd, throwing his arms up and catcalling.</p><p>When the song finished, Hermione breathlessly turned to James and said, "Thanks for that."</p><p>He grinned down at her, sweat beaded along his hairline. His fringe was sticking slightly to his forehead but the rest of his hair defied gravity and remained a mess. "For what?"</p><p>"Reminding me what fun is like," she said, then flushed thinking she said too much.</p><p>There was a softening in James's eyes, but before he could reply, Sirius came bounding to them, arms around James's shoulders, and then others were on the floor and she was dancing with James, Sirius, a Hufflepuff girl she didn't know too well, and the conversation was forgotten.</p><p>"COUNTDOWN TIME," shouted Diggory over the noise of the music, causing the crowd to cheer as they turned toward the bar where Diggory stood on top of it with Elliott Smith who had a bottle of something in one hand and a crown lopsided on his head as they led the countdown.</p><p>"TEN! NINE! EIGHT!"</p><p>Hermione caught Regulus's eyes as he resignedly joined her near his brother, and she threw an arm around him, hugging him to her side. His grey eyes lightened in amusement and she shouted, "Where's Barry?"</p><p>"Toilets," he shouted back, with a grin. "Drank too much!"</p><p>Hermione shook her head fondly at the thought of her friend. "We'll rescue him soon."</p><p>Regulus nodded.</p><p>"FOUR! THREE! TWO!"</p><p>Then Sirius was there, pulling his brother to him and giving him a smacking kiss on his head as "ONE!" reverberated through the pub, with loud cheers and the blowing of kazoos. One very drunk wizard had confetti shoot from his wand, but the muggles were too drunk to notice where the falling paper was coming from.</p><p>Hermione hugged Regulus next, kissing him on the cheek as Sirius and James were pressed cheek to cheek and hugging. The crowd began singing Auld Lang Syne, and Hermione turned to James, ready to hug him too.</p><p>But the grinning Gryffindor had other plans, caught up in the exuberance of the atmosphere, and pulled Hermione towards him sharply.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her full on the mouth.</p><hr /><p align="center">

  <strong>January 1976</strong>
</p><p>It was as everything froze. The ability to think, to breathe, to move. Hermione was still, unable to do <em>anything</em> except inhale - the scent of peppermint, spice - and taste - ale - and feel - warm lips on hers.</p><p>Hermione opened her eyes, and stared straight into James' as he slowly pulled back from her. His eyelashes fluttered just a bit, and then -</p><p>His were wide, the hazel shine to them surprised by his actions; they reflected her own amber, both of them just <em>staring</em> and unsure of what to do next. A light from a disco ball reflected off his glasses, and for the first time in a long time, Hermione didn't compare James to Harry - because quite honestly, Harry <em>never</em> looked that baffled when staring at her.</p><p>His hands were warm on her back, and their stomachs were pressed together, their chests brushing against one another as they breathed. James's mouth opened, and he blinked, but he couldn't form any words.</p><p>In a moment, sound came rushing back and there was noise everywhere as people were cheering, singing, to Auld Lang Syne or to the lyrics of the next song that was playing as they ushered in 1976.</p><p>"Hermione - I -"</p><p>Then Sirius was there, tipsy, hooking an arm around James's shoulder and making him stumble back and away from her as he laughing jeered, "Yeah, wrong Evans, mate!"</p><p>Hermione blinked - once - and then spun on her heel and pushed through the throng of sweaty people on their dance floor.</p><p>"Oi, what's her problem?"</p><p>James's eyes flicked to his friend, and there was a weak grin on his face as he chuckled, but it dropped quickly. He felt breathless and wasn't sure why. "Dunno. Hey - where's your brother?"</p><p>Sirius shrugged, eyes trailing to follow a girl in a short, short skirt. "Dunno. Lost him after I said Happy New Year."</p><p>"Listen, let's leave, yeah?" said James, reaching up and tugging at the collar of his stiff robes. He cleared his throat. He no longer felt comfortable in what he was wearing. "Let's head back to the Manor."</p><p>Sirius shrugged, but they left.</p><p>But he didn't feel like he could breathe when they were outside, either.</p><p>Strange.</p><hr /><p>Hermione pushed into the men's toilet, a single room occupied only by a very green Barty. He wearily looked up from where he was curled up around the toilet, his eyes beady. "'Mione?"</p><p>"Hey bestie," said Hermione, dropping to the floor next to him and smoothing his sweaty fringe from his forehead. He leaned into her cool hand. "You really did a number on yourself, didn't you?"</p><p>"<em>Mmm</em>," he moaned, turning back to point his face at the basin.</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips. "I don't think I'm going to be able to get you home this way. Maybe you should spend the night at Reggie's?"</p><p>Barty shook his head weakly. "His mum'll freak. He was supposed to be at the Greengrass's all evening. He's probably gone back anyway."</p><p>Hermione sighed. "Yeah, I guess you're right. Well… there's nothing else for it then."</p><p>"... wha?"</p><p>"You're coming home with me tonight and we're going to sneak you in," declared Hermione. "Can you stand?"</p><p>Barty groaned but gamely wobbled to his feet with Hermione supporting him. Her best friend was tall and gangly and leaned heavily on her as they slowly stumbled forward. Before exiting the toilet, Hermione took advantage of the numerous wizards in the area to cast a mouth-freshening charm on Barty, as well as straightening his clothes and cleaning them of sweat.</p><p>It was hard, making their way through the crowd, but a rather amused - and drunk - Elliot Smith noticed them and helped Hermione by taking Barty's other side until they were around the back of the pub, near a large skip, to call the Knight Bus.</p><p>Barty managed to hold on to the contents of what was left in his stomach by the time they arrived in Cokeworth, near the mining quarry and well away from any NYE revellers in town. It was, however, some distance to the Evans household, past several winding lanes to the terraced estates, but Hermione was determined to get Barty there. Luckily, the air cleared Barty's nausea and by the time they made it to the nearest houses, he was only leaning on his friend as they walked.</p><p>It was only half an hour later when they were taking a slow walk past the town center. There were still parties going on in the three pubs in town, including the carvery and community center. Hermione and Barty blended right in with those standing outside smoking or laughing with their friends. They were just another drunk couple on their way home.</p><p>Except -</p><p>"<em>Hermione</em>?"</p><p>Hermione tensed and twisted, Barty swearing as he went with her. They came to a stop at ninety degrees from where they started, with Hermione staring with wide eyes at her eldest sister surrounded by several others.</p><p>Petunia was wearing a nicely dressed floral dress, tights, and a light cardigan, her arm looped through a tall, burly close-cropped blond who was looking at them quizzically. Around them were others, similar in height to the teen she was with and a few girls in sparkly dresses.</p><p>"Oh. <em>Heeeeeeeeey</em>," greeted Hermione, drawing out the vowel. "Tuney." She glanced at the building behind them and nearly sighed as she realized Petunia and her friends ditched their parents and Lily to visit the pub instead of remaining at the rec center.</p><p>"Who's this, Pet?" asked the tall blond, glancing between the two girls and the dopey Barty that hung off Hermione.</p><p>"Hey," greeted Barty, smiling widely in his usual, manic way. He extended a hand, although it was pointed more at the concrete than at the blond. "I'm Barty! Junior! I'm Hermione's <em>best</em> friend!"</p><p>Petunia's eyebrows were hidden behind her fringe. "You know, when you said you were crashing a party with your friends, I really didn't think this was how the night would end."</p><p>Hermione shrugged but merely dislodged Barty, who grumbled. "Neither did I."</p><p>"Hey mate," the blond said, stepping from Petunia's side and helping take Barty off Hermione. "Where are you going?"</p><p>"Yes, 'Mione," drawled Petunia, crossing her arms and looking eerily like their mother. "Where <em>were</em> you going?"</p><p>"Petunia, do you know these two?" one of the girls asked.</p><p>"This is my little sister and a friend of hers from her school," explained Petunia, sighing.</p><p>"The freaky one?" asked another girl, shocked. She squinted at Hermione from behind very thick eyelashes. "I thought she was ginger."</p><p>Petunia shook her head and Hermione stared hard at her sister.</p><p>"So where are we taking them?" asked the blond. He slightly jostled a still grinning Barty. "And this one, especially?"</p><p>"I was going to smuggle Barty into the house," finally admitted Hermione. "<em>Not</em> my best plan, I will admit. He mixed his drinks and spent most of the night in the toilet."</p><p>The blond winced sympathetically.</p><p>"Blimey, mate," said the blond.</p><p>Petunia started saying goodbye to her friends, and the girls, who seemed not to care much for Lily by the sound of it, gave Hermione some cold, but polite, goodbyes as they paired off. The blond holding Barty remained, as did Petunia obviously.</p><p>"'Mione, you know he can't stay with us," said Petunia, looking at Barty again. For her first experience with a teenage wizard who wasn't Severus Snape, Petunia was handling herself well. "Why can't he go home?"</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. "His dad is really, <em>really</em> high up in the government," she improvised with the non-magical equivalent. "He'd get into a lot of trouble, and when I suggested our other friends' house, we both decided that was not a good idea, given how traditional his mother is."</p><p>Petunia sighed.</p><p>"He can sleep things off at mine," suggested the blond, making Petunia turn to him in surprise. "Honestly, I don't mind, Pet. It is your little sister's best friend. I think I can trust him."</p><p>Petunia fretted. "Sean, that's very kind of you, but what if he -? If he -" she turned to Hermione and flapped her hands. "-uses <em>you know</em>?"</p><p>Sean's own eyebrows jumped up. "<em>You know</em>?" he echoed in disbelief.</p><p>Hermione snorted. "I think he's going to sleep and then eat a lot. He's not in his right mind for anything else, Tuney, and Barty's in the same house as me. He's very smart."</p><p>Barty turned to Hermione, lolling his head on Sean's shoulder as he beamed at her. "I love you, too, 'Mione!"</p><p>Hermione reached over and patted Barty's cheek affectionately.</p><p>Petunia's eyes moved between the two, a calculating look at her, but she slowly nodded. Turning to her boyfriend, whom Hermione could now put a face to the name, she asked, "Are you sure, Sean?"</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>"Alright then," she replied, standing on her toes to kiss her boyfriend's cheek, whispering her goodbyes.</p><p>Then, Sean was turning to Hermione with Barty facing her too and grinning. "Nice to meet you, Hermione! I promise I'll take care of this one and bring 'im by tomorrow. Probably for lunch."</p><p>"Thanks." Hermione tried not to grin as Barty perked up and muttered, "Food?"</p><p>Hermione and Petunia watched as Sean dragged an enthusiastic Barty from the pub and in the opposite direction of where they lived, expertly drawing Barty's attention away from the neon signs in shop windows or very Muggle things.</p><p>Once they turned the corner, Petunia turned to her sister. "How were you planning on getting back into the house? Everyone thinks you're still there."</p><p>"The front door's lock can be jimmied," replied Hermione nonchalantly. "I learned how to pick it years ago. No one really questioned where I would disappear off to, and sometimes mum or Lily would lock the door forgetting I was at the library, or the rec center, or in the park. So I learned to make do."</p><p>Something flashed across Petunia's face, but it was gone quickly. "Well let's go back now. If someone asks, you stepped out for a walk and we bumped into each other."</p><p>They were silent for some time, Petunia hugging herself to keep warm. Eventually, Hermione demurred, "I'm sorry we interrupted your evening with Sean and your friends."</p><p>Petunia waved a very thin hand at her sister. "It's fine. I'm seeing Sean tomorrow anyway." She paused and glanced at Hermione, saying, "Besides, you're my sister. You come first."</p><p>"It didn't <em>quite</em> sound that way with regards to Lily," Hermione said quietly. She kept her tone light and nonjudgmental to see how Petunia would respond. "I'm not blind to how you two fight."</p><p>Petunia's mouth flattened into a thin line. "My… disagreement with Lily doesn't really have to do with you."</p><p>"So what is it?" asked a curious Hermione, who had kept out of much of the fights in her earlier years by just not physically being around her family as much as she could - at home or at Hogwarts. She often felt like an interloper in this new time. "Is it… about Hogwarts?"</p><p>Petunia sighed, hugging herself tighter and hunching a bit. It took Hermione a moment to realize how tall and willowy Petunia was, and wondered if her self-conscious sister even realized she could probably model if she wanted.</p><p>"A little bit," admitted the eldest Evans child. "And not really."</p><p>Hermione waited for Petunia to continue, which she eventually did.</p><p>"I had this… this entire idea in my mind that we would all go to secondary together. I would be a guide for you and Lily, having already gone through everything," she said quietly, green eyes down on the ground. "Isn't that the purpose of a big sister? To guide you? To protect you? To be there for her little sisters, no matter what?"</p><p>She shook her head, her blonde curls bouncing a bit. "I feel like not only did <em>I</em> miss out on doing all those big sister things I had planned with you and Lily, but I was cheated out of it with magic. Both of you have the abilities and spend your time together at - <em>that </em>school - and I can't be there. I can't help you with homework, or with boys, or the social pecking order. So what good am I?"</p><p>Hermione blinked in shock. <em>I never knew-!</em></p><p>"And then <em>precious Lily</em> comes home, and it's all about how amazing she's doing, who her friends are, and the pranks played on her by this," Petunia affected her voice, "<em>super cool and popular sport player</em> that she apparently can't stand because he bullies that Snape boy - and I - I -" she broke off, shrugging bitterly. "Where's my place in Lily's life? In your life?"</p><p>"Well," said Hermione slowly as she absorbed this new information in shock. "If it makes you feel any better, I rarely see or speak to Lily at school."</p><p>Petunia actually stopped walking to stare at her. "Wait - what?"</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "We're in different houses. I think she explained it once before? Yeah, anyway - I'm in Ravenclaw and she's in Gryffindor and has all these friends while I just keep to myself or hang out with Barty and Reggie. I also skipped like, three years in two courses, so that hardly made friends when you're a fourteen-year-old surrounded by seventeen-year-olds."</p><p>"But," sputtered Petunia as they started walking again, "Don't you have those - civvies days? In town?"</p><p>"Which I spend at the castle, doing my own research while Lily goes on dates," answered Hermione in a very matter-of-fact voice.</p><p>"Doesn't she try to sit with you at meals? Or you with her? Surely there are no rules against <em>that</em>?"</p><p>"Maybe once in a while she comes over, but honestly I think most people don't realize we're related. After all, I don't look like her."</p><p>Petunia snorted - and the sound, so unladylike, had Hermione staring at her. "Oh please, don't look at me like that. <em>None</em> of us looks anything alike in terms of hair colour. Both of us have the curls, but Lily doesn't; Lily and I share mother's eyes, but you have father's. You and Lily have magic, and I don't. And all three of us have different hair colours." She squinted and sniffed. "But you do have some red in yours, I suppose."</p><p>"Erm. Thanks?"</p><p>They had reached their street, and with certain daintiness, Petunia pulled out their keys from her purse. Before they went in, Petunia stopped Hermione by grabbing onto her upper arm and holding on.</p><p>"I was never upset with you," she said, strongly enough that Hermione started.</p><p>"I never thought-"</p><p>"I know you didn't like how I treated Lily," said Petunia, her mouth twisting. "Calling her a freak and ignoring her."</p><p>Hermione squirmed a bit in her sister's grip. "Well, it wasn't very nice-"</p><p>"I know," snapped Petunia. Then she sighed. "I <em>know</em>. It's hard enough dealing with my own jealousy and unhappiness and then seeing her come back so happy about that - that <em>place</em> and going on about that boy-"</p><p><em>Snape?</em> wondered Hermione.</p><p>"-but she also took you away. I guess I always thought that she was doing what <em>I</em> wanted to do for you both at Hogwarts." Petunia's eyes shifted away. "But I saw you this holiday - how you acted, and how she acted." Petunia looked at Hermione. "Does she even know you at all?"</p><p><em>Do any of you?</em> thought Hermione, slightly uncharitably. When had they all given up on her? On knowing their daughter, their sister? Why did it bother her <em>now</em>? She had pushed them all away first.</p><p>But - <em>but</em> - a tiny voice in her head went: <em>Barty and Regulus stood by your side and pushed through. Why didn't they?</em></p><p>"I'm sorry," said Petunia, breaking into Hermione's thoughts. Her head jerked up in surprise to see Petunia's toying with the key. "I'm sorry I wasn't a better sister."</p><p>"So am I," replied Hermione quietly.</p><p>Petunia's lips slowly turned up in a gentle smile. "New year, new us?"</p><p>Hermione's smile matched hers. "New year," she agreed, "new us."</p><hr /><p>Barty made it home safely the following day, beginning 1976 with a wicked hangover that he couldn't explain away to his mother or her knowing stare. Luckily, his father had been out, dealing with the fallout of some very drunk wizards and Muggle-baiting, he wrote to Hermione, that he never knew that his son wasn't even home for New Years.</p><p>Regulus had also made it home safely, citing that he skipped out on the Greengrass's early to his mother's displeasure, while Sirius kept silent and merely stared at his younger brother as if he had never seen him before. (Regulus wrote that every so often, Sirius would waggle his eyebrows at him from behind their mother's back, like they shared some amazing secret. The younger Black was thoroughly fed up.)</p><p>The winter term for Hogwarts began on a chilly January with frosted windows and a bitter, Arctic wind that kept students inside their common rooms, huddled near the fireplaces - except for Hermione. It was Friday, and she and James had a study date. OWLs were only five months away!</p><p>Hermione was set up, tapping her quill impatiently. Potter had never been late since their first tutoring session, so she was mildly concerned and annoyed.</p><p>Finally, he swept in; his hair in disarray and heavily sat in the seat across from her in their tiny nook. "Merlin, I am <em>so sorry</em> -" he blushed and fluffed up his hair some more. "Things were - I wasn't sure - it's been -"</p><p>Hermione stared. "Are you <em>blushing</em>? Did my sister finally say yes to a date or something?"</p><p>His flush deepened. "I - ah - no -"</p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes. "Alright…" she then pulled out and flipped her Arithmancy text to the correct chapter, and extended her hand over the table towards James, her palm up as she made 'gimme' motions with her hand.</p><p>He stared at her hand for a long moment.</p><p>"<em>Merlin</em>, Potter," said Hermione exasperatedly, "What is <em>with</em> you? Your homework? From Yule break?"</p><p>His hazel eyes snapped up to hers and widened behind his glasses.</p><p>"Oh! Yes! Right!" he then scrambled to turn in the seat to check his shoulder bag and began pulling out bits and bobs and putting them on the table while Hermione's incredulous stare made her eyes grow wide.</p><p>"Potter."</p><p>He immediately paused.</p><p>"Your homework?"</p><p>He cleared his throat and finally pulled out his textbook, with the homework in between the cover and first page. Although she was unsure what was going with him, she squinted and frowned, and then resolved to ignore it, going over his past homework and notes.</p><p>Across from her, Potter fidgeted, twisting his fingers around, bringing his wand out and tapping it on the table, and then eventually pulling a snitch from his bag and tossing it in the air and catching it before it zipped down one of the aisles.</p><p>The glint of the snitch caught Hermione's attention as she finished checking his homework, and she glanced up. He wasn't even paying her attention, just focused on absently catching the snitch while his thoughts turned inward. There was a small smile on his face.</p><p><em>How many times have I heard Lily complain about him playing with "that stupid snitch" at home? He must be thinking of her</em>, thought Hermione, rolling her eyes. She dropped her quill and nonverbally had her homework neatly roll up, flying over towards him.</p><p>He jumped at the scroll rested on his open textbook, glancing down at it and then back at her. "How - how did I do?"</p><p>Hermione felt a true, and fond, smile creep onto her lips. "Well, I think you'll do just acceptable, Potter."</p><p>He looked horrified. "An <em>A</em>? That's it after all the work we've put into this?"</p><p>"For your OWL? Yeah," answered Hermione. "But if we keep this up? By May? I can see you getting an O."</p><p>"<em>Really</em>?" a grin split his face, and his eyes sparkled. He put the snitch into his bag and leaned across the table.</p><p>"Really," nodded Hermione. "I think we can call tonight to an end, and start up with your fifth-year material next week."</p><p>"I-" he broke off, his grin turning lopsided. He stood, shoving his homework into his bag, along with his text. "Thank you, Hermione! I couldn't' do this without you!"</p><p>Hermione stood too, shrugging her shoulders. "You're doing all the hard work, Potter, take some credit."</p><p>Without realizing it, he stepped forward and hugged her tightly. Hermione stiffened in shock, arms at her sides and eyes wide. He felt her response and stepped back, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>"Merlin - I'm sorry -" and he truly was, as he looked down in frustration and stepped further back.</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat and choked out, "Yeah, it's fine-"</p><p>"No, it's not-" he was red again.</p><p>Hermione stopped and peered at him, watching his body language as he shifted from foot to foot, his blush extending up to redden his ears. Suddenly, his behaviour was making sense. "Potter - is this about New Years?"</p><p>His face went as red as his Gryffindor jumper.</p><p>She sighed. "Look - it was - it meant nothing, right? You fancy my sister, everyone knows that. Like Sirius said - wrong Evans. It's totally cool." She even waved a hand to illustrate how nonchalant she was about having her first kiss in this time by him. Not like <em>he</em> knew that.</p><p>Something in Potter stilled as she spoke, and his blush receded a bit. "Erm. Yes. Yes - that's right. Lily. Lily Evans, that is."</p><p>"Cool," replied Hermione. She picked up her school bag and slung it over her shoulder. "In that case, I'm heading out. Got other things to do. See you around, Potter."</p><p>"Yeah, see you, Hermione," he croaked out.</p><hr /><p>Two weeks later, as January came to a close, and Hermione read a letter from Petunia (… <em>I'm thinking London, but it's so far away, isn't it? Do you think mummy and daddy will let me go? I think this is what I really want to do and pursue…),</em> Lily stopped by the Ravenclaw table at dinner.</p><p>"Hey Hermy," she greeted, sliding onto the bench.</p><p>"No," replied Hermione, not looking up from the letter while Barty's slid back and forth, absently mixing his mash and peas into one lumpy pile.</p><p>"You don't even know what I'm going to say!" the Gryffindor protested.</p><p>Hermione glanced up this time. "I won't do anything anyway if you're going to call me 'Hermy.'"</p><p>Lily sighed. "Fine. Anyway - I wanted to ask you a question."</p><p>"Is it about school?" asked Hermione, frowning. "Because you're a year ahead of me. I really don't think I can help you."</p><p>"No - it's not -"</p><p>"Then is it about - you know - something personal?" Hermione's eyes slid to the Gryffindor table. "Because you're a year ahead of me. I really don't think I can help you unless it's in seventh-year material for Arithmancy or Charms, the latter which you're practically a savant in."</p><p>Lily scowled. "<em>No</em>, it's -"</p><p>"Have mum or dad sent an owl? Tuney's been pretty consistent in writing me this term, but she didn't mention anything…"</p><p>"No, it's not mum and dad - wait," surprise flitted across Lily's face. "<em>Tuney's</em> writing you?"</p><p>Hermione cocked her head to the side. "Yeah. Don't you write to her? She's not bad in replying quickly."</p><p>"What? She <em>does</em>? I mean - no, I haven't written her in years -" Lily shook her head. "Ugh, stop trying to change the topic. I'm trying to ask you about Potter!"</p><p>Barty choked on his roast.</p><p>"<em>Potter?</em>" replied Hermione incredulously, snapping her book shut and staring at Lily in surprise. "What about him? I thought you can't stand him."</p><p>"I <em>can't</em>," emphasized Lily strongly, ducking her head a bit to stare at her sister. Hermione felt riveted in her sister's emerald eyes. "But - you are still tutoring him weekly, right?"</p><p>Hermione slowly nodded.</p><p>"Right, right. So… have you noticed… anything... <em>weird</em> with him lately?" continued Lily.</p><p>Hermione frowned. "Weird, how?"</p><p>Lily sighed, tossing her red hair over her shoulder. It gleamed in the candlelight. "I'm not sure. But - something's changed. I can't put my finger on it. I just thought you'd notice and know since you see him often."</p><p>"He's in <em>your </em>house," pointed out Barty acidly. "You see him more than she does."</p><p>Lily pursed her lips, turning away from Barty to face Hermione instead. "Look, can you just - I don't know - keep an eye out?" her eyes narrowed. "I bet he's planning something big on the Slytherins sometime soon."</p><p>"Erm," began Hermione, sharing a look with Barty who then rolled his eyes. "I'm pretty sure he's not - but yeah… sure…"</p><p>"Great!" Lily's mood changed from her deep scowl to a bright smile. She leaned forward and bussed Hermione on the cheek, leaving the Ravenclaw table as quickly as she arrived. "Thanks, Hermy!"</p><p>Hermione scowled this time. "<em>Not. Hermy.</em>"</p><p>She was silent, staring at her plate for several long moments before Barty asked, "What was the purpose in that?"</p><p>Frowning, Hermione turned partially in her seat to glance over her shoulder at the Gryffindor table; while she normally had her back to them, opting to face Slytherin and Regulus at his table, both she and Barty were keenly aware of the Marauders at meal times in case of unfortunate pranks.</p><p>The four were clustered together, whispering and laughing as they ate dinner. Sirius was animated, waving his hands around as he used a fork to demonstrate something. Pettigrew was hanging on the Black heir's every word, while Lupin interjected something that made Potter snort and laugh, banging his hand on the table.</p><p><em>What is Lily on about? There's nothing different with Potter,</em> she thought, eyes narrowed.</p><p>As if hearing her thoughts, Potter looked up and caught her eyes. He grinned, mouthing, "<em>Alright?</em>" to her.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Holding her gaze, his grin widened, and he reached up and ran a hand through his hair, making it messier than before. Then, he turned back to his friends, and Hermione turned around to face the proper way on their table.</p><p>"I think I should take my sister to the hospital wing," said Hermione to Barty, shaking her head. "Clearly, Lily is losing her mind." <em>The stress of OWLs was getting to her.</em></p><p>Barty was silent, eyes flickering between the Gryffindor table and her, a thoughtful frown on his face.</p><p>"Yeah…" he agreed slowly. "Sure."</p><p>But Hermione put it out of her mind. She had other things to worry about.</p><hr /><p align="center">

  <strong>January 1976</strong>
</p><p>Like most Januarys straight through to June, time passed quickly - so much so that the entire five months disappeared in a blink. One moment, Hermione was studying in the library for her upcoming NEWT exams in Arithmancy and Charms, her two favourite classes, spending time with Barty and Regulus, researching and practicing her own form of transmutation and wandless magic, and tutoring Potter in Arithmancy.</p><p>After her breakthrough with the flower, Hermione found herself back in the Room of Requirements with her (fake) Harry watching her curiously, as she paced, muttering to herself under her breath as her brain jumped from one idea to the next, her synapses firing hotly.</p><p>Her understanding of transmutation was growing rapidly. She was far beyond her research back in her future - alternate timeline? - which made a part of her squirm in happiness, and the rest made her annoyed at the slow progression.</p><p>"I think you're over thinking this," said Harry. His image flickered for a moment, and then he was no longer standing, watching her placidly, but sitting on what looked like a replica of a Gryffindor armchair - one she was familiar with, in her other life, and its placement by the fire and in which she and her friends would often congregate around.</p><p>"I thought we agreed that I'm the brains of this operation," muttered Hermione, tugging on a curl. Her eyes cut to her friend.</p><p>Harry sighed. "You're frustrated with your lack of advancement. I understand that."</p><p>"<em>Because you're me</em>," muttered Hermione darkly.</p><p>Harry blithely ignored her. "Let's break it down, shall we? When you're stuck, and you don't know what to do next - what do you do, Hermione?"</p><p>Hermione stopped pacing, turned to Harry, and together they said, "We break it down into smaller parts."</p><p>He grinned at her, and she felt her lips quirking up into a smile, too.</p><p>With a sigh, she bounded over to him in his chair. An identical one popped into existence opposite him, and Hermione slid in it as the room shifted from a large white space to an eerie replica of the Gryffindor Common Room from their time, right down to the scorch marks Seamus left after another failed water-into-wine attempt.</p><p>"So," began not-Harry, leaning forward in his seat as his ankle crossed over the opposite knee and he steeped his fingertips together. "Basics. Begin with that. What do you know about magic?"</p><p>Hermione sighed at the simplicity - and complexity - of the question. "Magic is a form of energy that each witch or wizard has."</p><p>"Very <em>Star Wars</em>," replied Harry, a mocking glint in his eyes behind his frames. He warped between fourteen-year-old him and the much older forty-something Hermione knew him as, grey at his temples.</p><p>"Shut up."</p><p>"Is that what magic really is, though?"</p><p>Hermione frowned. "I… guess not."</p><p>"Is it merely just in magical folk?" continued Harry.</p><p>"Well… isn't it?" replied back Hermione. "We use magic, we cast spells. They dissipate once the magic is used up because it completes its purpose."</p><p>"Yes," agreed Harry, "But of our school? This Room? Permanent magic? Is it because it has been soaked up over countless years?"</p><p>Hermione frowned. She reached up and began playing with a curl. "No… I don't think so."</p><p>"So magic has some sort of permanence," continued Harry. "That's the difference between transfiguration and transmutation, right?"</p><p>"Yes," nodded Hermione, speaking slowly. "Transfiguration is the changing of one thing to another for a temporary state because it remains in its original form at the molecular level despite the outward physical changes. Transmutation is the changing of one thing into another <em>completely</em> where it is changed from one state of being to another."</p><p>"And if that's the case, the magic can't <em>just</em> come from the witch or wizard casting it, can it?" asked a smug Harry as he leaned back.</p><p>Hermione blinked. "No. No, it can't."</p><p>"Because magic from a witch or wizard would dissipate after a while," continued Harry.</p><p>"Which means there is ambient magic!" grinned Hermione, to which Harry nodded. Then, Hermione's grin slid slowly into a resting face as she thought. "But… where is the magic coming from?"</p><p>"Think about it," urged Harry. "Think of moments of great magic - monuments, buildings, rooms. Objects of power. Feats of strength."</p><p>So Hermione turned her thoughts inward and thought of what Harry requested of her. She thought first of the Room of Requirement, as it was the easiest given she was currently using it. The history of the Room was unknown - but potentially one of the Hogwarts founders had created it, using Runes, Arithmancy, Charms, and other work. The magic itself should have faded over time, but Hogwarts - by extension - soaked up ambient magic over the centuries until the Room became mildly sentient. That suggested that magic had its own ideas and behaved beyond its Arithmetic and Runic formulations.</p><p>Another example of semi-sentient magic was the Goblet of Fire; an object of power that was used to bind Harry in the TriWizard Tournament. Hermione drew back to the moment of Harry's name being called and frowned.</p><p>Her eyes slipped closed, and her brow furrowed. She could picture the Great Hall perfectly: the bobbing and dipping of the floating candles above her that Halloween, the shadows dancing on the edges of the hall, as they grew longer. The bright, vibrant colour of Dumbledore's robes as he spread his arms and began calling out familiar names of people she knew well; and when he read Harry's, she waited for the familiar shock and horror to spread through her, as the memory always prompted.</p><p>It failed to arrive.</p><p>Her frown deepened into a scowl. <em>I distinctly remember my look of shock and horror that Harry's name came out of the Goblet. So why aren't I getting the echoes of those feelings?</em></p><p>She then thought of later that night, Ron's jealousy, her incredulity toward Ron and the situation, even Harry's bitterness and her fear for him. She could <em>remember</em> having felt the emotions, but as she squished her eyes shut tight, nearly vibrating with intensity at trying to remember those moments, she could not muster the emotional connection.</p><p>"What…" her eyes popped open and she looked at a rather somber Harry across from her. "What is happening to my memories?"</p><p>"It's like you said - they're memories," the room-supplied Harry answered, his voice slightly flat and monotone. "Memories of a different time. Of a different you."</p><p>"Those memories <em>made me</em>!" snarled Hermione. "Did you - did the magic that brought me here - did it take those from me?!"</p><p>"I did not," replied Harry, in that same flat tone.</p><p><em>This is not me supplying the room now,</em> thought Hermione, eyeing the new Harry carefully. This was something older… stronger, than what she mustered up as her sounding board and conscience.</p><p>The Room continued. "You experienced a significant trauma, one that involved magic at its most pure. It brought you here. Here, where you can do the most. For the people, the timeline as you know it. But you cannot do that with your emotional attachments."</p><p>Hermione bristled. <em>Emotional attachments?!</em></p><p>Sensing her thoughts, the Room supplied, "Yes, your memories make you who you are, Hermione Granger/Hermione Evans-" it was like the two names were said at once, mangling her last name, layered with a strange dual, vibrating tone "-and those cannot be taken from you. But the trauma you experienced as a child while here at Hogwarts, and during your War, can be."</p><p>"You - You did what?" asked a flabbergasted Hermione, eyes wide and mouth open.</p><p>"I did not." The reply was flat and strange but slightly affronted. "I am just another vessel."</p><p>Hermione's eyes narrowed. "To what purpose was the removal of my emotions to those memories?" Fear made her eyes widen. "Will I- will I begin to forget my feelings for Harry and Ron? Ginny? George? The Weasleys, or Andromeda or Teddy? Will they stop having meaning in my life?"</p><p>"They will not. They <em>should</em> not," the Room replied, gently as its monotone voice softened. "They are a part of you, no matter when you are. You will just be removed from the emotions to ensure you are not crippled by them now."</p><p>At Hermione's blank stare, the Room-Harry sighed. "You must live more in the present; immerse yourself here and in the now. Not in your past and their future. That time is gone. Your yesterdays are to be your tomorrows - what has happened once may not happen again. Or it might. Time is not a straight line."</p><p>"I'm well aware of how time travel works, thank you," snipped Hermione.</p><p>"Are you?" that Harry raised his eyebrows in a condescending manner and Hermione wrinkled her nose. "If you are, then how did you come to be here, not as Hermione Granger, but as Hermione Evans?"</p><p>"I-" Hermione snapped her mouth shut. <em>Okay, so I don't have an answer to that.</em></p><p>Not-Harry looked knowingly at her, and then his face… softened from its edges and the blank look he wore turned back into the slightly impish one she remembered.</p><p>"Did you think of them? What did those feats of magic and objects of power help you conclude?" he asked, as though the past ten minutes never happened.</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat, shifting uncomfortably in the chair as she realized she was quite literally in the belly of one such place of power. Awkwardly, she said, "Yeah. I think I understand."</p><p>Room- and memory-supplied Harry beamed at her. "Brilliant. So your conclusion is…?"</p><p><em>This place is fucking weird, and I will never fully understand magic,</em> thought a grim Hermione, but she gamely replied, "Magic is everywhere. In everything. It's about <em>access</em>."</p><p>"And understanding," nodded Harry in agreement. "You <em>understand</em> the structure of objects and spells, Hermione - to <em>access</em> it you just need something… more."</p><p>"But how does one access magic?"</p><p>Hermione stood from the chair and the room morphed again, from the Gryffindor Common room to a generic white room, but with columns running the length of it. Hermione eyed them in confusion and then turned to Harry.</p><p>"What do you think you need to <em>alter</em> things, Hermione?"</p><p>"I need…" she murmured, closing her eyes and picturing the room in her mind, the columns specifically. She could feel her magic floating and tingling around and in her; she could feel the faint buzz and the slightly metallic taste to the magic in the air from the Room of Requirements. How did she get her magic to interact with the ambient magic?</p><p>Apparition was about the three D's: Destination, Determination, and Deliberation. Magic itself in spell casting was about Determination and Deliberation. Could she determine what she wanted and then deliberately focus on altering the structure?</p><p>Gamely, Hermione gathered her magic and reached out with her senses, her memory of the room, and her visual representation. She focused on a nearby column, learning its shape, its features, its construction makeup. Once she felt like she knew it intimately, she took a deep breath and pushed, nudging her magic up against it.</p><p>It hit the column like a wave crashing against a wall, breaking and barely affecting it.</p><p>Vaguely, she heard Harry chuckle.</p><p>Frowning, she tried again, and the same result happened: her magic crashed and then slid back, oil and water mixing and separating, never quite mingling together to help get her where she wanted to go without creating the rune- and Arithmancy-based transmutation circles.</p><p>"What am I missing?" she muttered, opening her eyes and squinting.</p><p>"Stop trying to browbeat it," suggested Harry. "Are you always able to do a spell by forcing it to happen? Magic, especially strong magic, is finicky. Sure, strong emotion may cast a Patronus, but the more delicate the end result, the more precise you need to be. It takes a deft hand. Try that."</p><p><em>Deft and delicate hand</em>, thought Hermione, absently nodding. <em>Yeah, I can do that</em>.</p><p>She pushed up the sleeves of her shirt, shook her limbs out, and closed her eyes once more. This time, instead of pushing her magic against the columns, she let her magic sidle up to it, tentative and friendly. The ambient magic of the Room curiously nudged back, and Hermione bit back a grin.</p><p>Her magic began to settle on top of the Room's, as a comforting blanket under it enveloped the ambient magic. Soon, the two were mingling and Hermione felt an immediate head rush as her senses grew and expanded. With a firm image of what she wanted to columns to look like, she gently sent it to her magic, which queried it to the ambient magic.</p><p>There was a tingle on her fingertips and the room crackled with electricity, and she opened her eyes.</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>Instead of a white room with white columns, there were four elaborate statues of the four founders holding up the room, in colour with textured marble to mimic the fabric of their robes. Their faces were expressive, works of Roman and Grecian art, in poses of power and memory: Ravenclaw with her wand out and scrolls and an eagle perched on her outstretched hand and a stern visage as she stared out at her female counterpart; Hufflepuff, with vines creeping up her legs and coiling around her arms like a lover's embrace from behind, her face alight with a kind smile and clever eyes.</p><p>Slytherin and Gryffindor faced each other, Gryffindor in a knight's pose with his large, long broadsword tip-down and in front of him. His hair was free and flowing and she blushed slightly realizing she took the stern, square face and jaw from a muggle romance novel cover. But his face was solemn and serious, and he wore it nobly.</p><p>Slytherin, on the other hand, was movement personified with his robes flowing long and out behind him, arms outstretched and in the midst of some powerful magic. His hair was bound back, long and silky, and his eyes fierce and expressive as he controlled the world around him through his magic.</p><p>They were breathtaking.</p><p><em>She had done that</em>.</p><p>Behind her, Harry clapped, and she whirled, still taken aback by the power she wielded. But the image of Harry flickered, from fourteen to forty, and back, and his voice was that of the room's when it said, "Oh, well done. Well done, indeed Hermione Granger/Evans."</p><p>A shiver shot down Hermione's spine.</p><p>"I think we can expect great things from you," it continued, in that strange, dual-layered voice that was leaden with power and something <em>other</em>.</p><p>Hermione swallowed thickly and bowed her head in thanks. "I hope to live up to your expectations."</p><p>The Room's Harry gave her a fond if not exasperated smile. "Hermione Granger/Evans, if I did not think you were worth it, you would not be here."</p><p>And at that strange pronouncement, Hermione gave a tight smile and tried to desperately think that <em>that</em> didn't sound like prophecy, at all.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>February 1976</strong>
</p><p>It began simply, with a single question, during breakfast in February.</p><p>Sirius, rumpled with sleep and bleary-eyed, wandered into the Great Hall and slumped into his usual seat at James's side, absently reaching for the coffee that Hogsmeade-trip morning.</p><p>Remus, opposite them with an empty space for where Peter sat, didn't even look up from his newspaper - he has his Daily Prophet ordered and read before most of the Gryffindors came down to the table - as Sirius's behaviour was typical.</p><p>As the table began to fill, Sirius, slowly waking up, took the time to survey the hall, looking for the next girl he'd ask out as his date for the evening. He skipped over the Slytherins - <em>but there's Reg, buttering up some toast, looking rather smug. Hmm. Maybe that Calypso finally gave him the time of day.</em></p><p>He then jotted his eyes over to the Hufflepuff table, looking and easily finding the girls Reg's mate Crouch had inadvertently insulted at the New Year's party.</p><p>Both girls caught his eye and both blushed very red, fluttered their eyelashes at him, and giggled. He winced and quickly turned his back on the Hufflepuff table, which had him facing the rest of the Gryffindors, and, incidentally, the fifth year girls.</p><p><em>I can't ask Marlene again,</em> he thought mulishly. <em>I've already asked her twice this year and any more and people will start to think we're going steady. And Alice is dating Frank Longbottom - now </em>that's <em>a big guy I don't want to be in a fight against. And Phoebe Robinson is… well… how she ended up in Gryffindor I'll never know.</em></p><p>
  <em>And of course, then there's Lily. Who is untouchable, because James will loudly and verbally stake his claim, like clockwork.</em>
</p><p>Sirius frowned, and mentally went over what he just thought.</p><p><em>Stake his claim. Loudly and verbally. Clockwork</em>.</p><p>Sirius's frown deepened and he turned to look at his best friend. James was in the middle of a conversation with Remus, an animated one by the sound of it, and by the glean in his eyes.</p><p>"-thinking that maybe we could use Poincaré theory," said James.</p><p>Remus nodded slowly. "I don't take Arithmancy, but I've heard it used before…" He frowned.</p><p>"The theory is the basis of chaos theory," explained James, his voice rising in enthusiasm as his hands moved around, too. "It deals with bodies in motion and, when people are affected, how their behaviours change and alter accordingly."<br />Sirius, who was doing quite well in Arithmancy, frowned. Because that was a perfect, if not paraphrased, answer.</p><p>"You need to use a dynamical system to explore the variables," the black-haired Potter explained, drawing an oval in the air with a finger. "Hermione explained it to me the other week - said it would be great if I knew all the variables in planning something with multiple reference points to ensure optimal results -"</p><p><em>Hermione?</em> Sirius blinked. <em>Hermione</em> Evans?</p><p>He looked around the Great Hall again, spotting Lily laughing and talking with her dorm mates, flipping her red hair over her shoulder in response to something one said.</p><p>He then pulled out his pocket watch - a birthday gift from his father that he actually treasured, not that he'd tell anyone that - and realized that breakfast was almost over. Sirius looked back at James, who hadn't even mentioned <em>Lily</em> yet, for the forty minutes they'd been sitting at the table together.</p><p>Concerned, Sirius leaned over and placed a hand on James's forehead.</p><p>Sputtering, James broke off his explanation of dynamic systems and leaned away from Sirius. "Padfoot! What the hell!"</p><p>Sirius leaned closer, peering into James's hazel eyes. "You're ill, aren't you?"</p><p>"What? No!"</p><p>Sirius narrowed his eyes. "Yes, you are."</p><p>"I am <em>not</em>," retorted James, shoving Sirius's hand out of his face. He turned to Remus. "Tell him, Moony! I'm perfectly fine."</p><p>"I have to agree with James, Sirius." Remus picked up the mug of tea in front of him and frowned at both of them from over the top of its lip. "Why do you think he's ill?"</p><p>Sirius stared blankly at his two friends, looking at them back and forth. Remus's expression was rather placid - like he was humouring Sirius - while James' chin had a stubborn tilt to it. "You - You don't realize?"</p><p>"Realize <em>what</em>?" asked a rather irate James.</p><p>"You haven't spoken to Lily since she came down to breakfast," said Sirius, completely flabbergasted at the idea.</p><p>Then - James looked surprised like he hadn't even realized. Remus, on the other hand, shifted his eyes from Sirius to James, and then narrowed them thoughtfully as they all, in one smooth movement, turned to look down the Gryffindor table toward Lily Evans.</p><p>Obviously, she felt their eyes on her - from her magic prickling a warning, perhaps - because she stiffened and then slowly turned in her seat, green eyes flashing angrily as she met theirs. She glowered, and the thought of <em>what are they up to? </em>passed over her face, easily read.</p><p>Remus smiled; Sirius waved, and James reached up to ruffle his already wild hair.</p><p>Lily's scowl deepened.</p><p>"Say - Lily -" began James, pitching his voice so that she could hear him over the din of the Great Hall and the other students between their seats at the Gryffindor table.</p><p>"No." The girl in question snapped out and then turned around, ignoring the Marauders completely.</p><p>Sirius waited patiently for the follow-up, his eyes still on Lily. He waited for several, long seconds, before realizing that James had gone back to his conversation with Remus.</p><p>"Wait - <em>what</em>?"</p><p>"What what?" asked James, his voice still dripping with some annoyance at the second interruption in his conversation with their werewolf friend.</p><p>Sirius blinked. "Aren't you going to continue to ask Evans out? Like… jump on the table? Shout something at her? Enchant the toast to serenade her?"</p><p>From behind his glasses, James stared at Sirius. "She said no. Why would I ask her again?"</p><p>Remus dropped his mug, sending it crashing onto his plate. What remained of his tea sloshed everywhere, including over his leftover scrambled eggs and sausages. Luckily, the noise was swallowed by the ambient noise from the rest of the students, so no one noticed, but between the three friends, it was as loud as a cannon blast.</p><p>Wide eyed, Remus said, "Because her saying no never stopped you before."</p><p>James shrugged.</p><p>The two were still staring at him when Peter breathlessly slid into his spot next to Remus. The thin teen glanced between the three and asked, "What did I miss?"</p><p>And without a lick of humour, Sirius replied, "The world ending."</p><hr /><p>It continued on Valentine's Day, or rather the lead up on the night before, when the boys were in their dorm room. James was on his bed, absently tossing a snitch in the air and catching it as he lay back and stared up at the red canopy of his poster bed, ankles crossed. Remus was opposite him, sitting cross-legged on his bed, and chewing on the end of a sugar quill as he edited a nervous Peter's essay.</p><p>Sirius entered the room with fanfare: the door swung on well-oiled hinges and banged against the stone wall behind, slamming hard into it and bouncing back toward the Black heir. He quickly sidestepped the door and let it slam shut behind him.</p><p>"Gentlemen! Marauders! Friends!" enthused Sirius as he strode forward, arms spread wide. "Who is the sexiest fifth year there is?"</p><p>"Are we supposed to answer that or is it rhetorical?" asked Remus, not looking up from the essay. Peter, sitting on his bed, brought a hand up and nervously chewed on a hangnail.</p><p>"Rhetorical, Moony," replied Sirius, launching himself onto his bed and bouncing a bit on it. "Because the answer is <em>me</em>, of course."</p><p>"Of course," echoed Remus sarcastically.</p><p>Sirius tossed his curls and, propping himself up on an elbow as he lounge, one leg bent up, he turned toward James. "Oi, mate - what's with you? Evans turn you down as your Valentine date?"</p><p>"Evans?" James glanced over. "Oh - you mean Lily. No."</p><p>Sirius's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean <em>no</em>? You did ask her right? Because Jimmy - if you didn't - I'd begin to think something's wrong."</p><p>James sighed. "Of <em>course</em> I asked her out, Padfoot." He sat up, caught the snitch, and summoned its lockbox. He placed it in it, firmly shutting the fluttering gold ball in it, and then turned to his best friend. "And of course she said no. As usual."</p><p>"So why the long face?" asked Sirius.</p><p>James ran a hand through his hair, and Sirius glanced at Remus, who shrugged at the nervous gesture. He didn't know what was wrong, either.</p><p>"It's just - well - it'll sound silly," hedged James.</p><p>"I doubt that," piped up Peter, giving an encouraging smile to their leader and friend. "I often think I'll do something silly but you always tell me that's not true, and then I do it or say it, and things turn out fine, Prongs."</p><p>James sent a weak smile in return. "Thanks, Pete."</p><p>"<em>So</em>…?" drawled Sirius.</p><p>"I was just thinking," began James, shifting uncomfortably on his bed as three sets of eyes focused intently on him. "As a thank you, maybe I could get something for Hermione? She's been very kind and thoughtful since the school year began, helping me with Arithmancy. I'd never have caught up to the fifth year material if it weren't for her."</p><p>Remus's eyes narrowed.</p><p>"You want to get her a gift?" asked Peter in confirmation, scrunching his face up. "Like… a thank you gift?"</p><p>James nodded. "I haven't yet - and I'm doing really well, she even said so herself. So I thought it would be a nice gesture."</p><p>"Yeah, but…" Sirius trailed off. "It's Valentine's, mate. Don't you think she'd get the wrong idea?"</p><p>"The wrong idea?" echoed James, looking completely befuddled with his wide eyes.</p><p>"Yeah…" Sirius looked around the room, for Remus and Peter to back him up. "You know? Valentine's Day? Gifts? Girls?"</p><p>Understanding dawned on James's face, and then it just a quickly shuttered behind something and his face went blank. "Don't be daft. Hermione's a <em>friend</em>, Padfoot."</p><p>And that was the end of that conversation.</p><p>(Yet, when Valentine's Day approached, Sirius kept his eyes open and peeled but James never once went over to Hermione Evans during meal times; he stuck to his friend like a sticking charm during the day, and he never left his side. But a day later, on February 15th, he watched as Hermione looked up from her breakfast and whatever Crouch was saying to her, catch James's eyes, and nod once, a tiny smile spreading across her face.</p><p>And James, at his side, grinned back.)</p><hr /><p>By the time March rolled around, Sirius was convinced something was up with James Potter. Remus, he knew (although they had yet to speak out loud about the matter), was also concerned - or quietly observant as he carefully watched James in classes that Sirius did not attend, and, strangely enough, during meal time. Peter was merely happy to go along with Sirius's thoughts but had little opinion on the matter.</p><p>What Sirius knew, however, was that it revolved around the Evans sister, and he was determined to get to the bottom of it and get his best friend back! James was <em>not</em> acting like himself: he was studious; he was answering questions in class <em>voluntarily</em> and had even cut down on his prank time with Sirius and the other Marauders citing he had to <em>study.</em> STUDY. In the library! For his Arithmancy OWL! Which was still three months away!</p><p>Ridiculous.</p><p>Despite liking the little spitfire, Sirius had a strong suspicion that this was Hermione Evans fault. She was corrupting Prongs, changing him, making him think that school was important, that his grades mattered. She was filling his head with poison! Or something. He wasn't sure how yet, or even why, so he spent the next week or so subtly watching her (which wasn't very subtly at all).</p><p>He expertly trailed James to his study sessions with her and waited under the <em>borrowed</em> invisibility cloak to see what they did. He was expecting… love potions. Confundus charms. Or, given the girls' talent in spell crafting, something he had never heard or seen of before.</p><p>Instead, they… did homework. Hermione Evans tutored James on the material from just a month ago in their OWL class, and Sirius was quietly impressed at how well she caught him up in time for their exams.</p><p>But, as Sirius squinted his eyes from behind a large text titled <em>Miraculous Mishaps in Modern Magic</em>, there was something… <em>off </em>about their interactions. Nothing improper or overt, actually; just, off…</p><p>Like how when James got all the answers to his homework (now nearly all up to date with class; he was only a few worksheets behind), the grin that Hermione sent James had his best mate puff up in pride and reach up to fluff his hair.</p><p>Or, like when James would ask a rather insightful question, Hermione would lean back in her seat, eyes turned upward to the ceiling in deep thought, before nodding and muttering something like, "I hadn't thought of that - well done!" and <em>she'd</em> send <em>him</em> an impressed look.</p><p><em>Hmm</em>, thought Sirius, eyes darting back and forth. <em>This requires more reconnaissance</em>.</p><hr /><p>Despite being curious, Remus refused to help. So Sirius enlisted Peter, whom most people overlooked anyway, making him the best sort of spy out there.</p><p>In April, at the end of one of the Gryffindor/Hufflepuff Quidditch matches (and of course, Gryffindor victory), Peter told Sirius that he caught James giving Hermione a hug outside the locker room, once the stands had cleared and the team was washing up before heading to the dorm room for their celebratory party.</p><p>In May, Sirius caught James leaning against the rough stone-hewed wall of a courtyard off the Clock Tower, bracing his forearm against it and well above Hermione's head as she pressed back against the same wall, looking up at him.</p><p>Sirius, used to all manner of expression on the opposite sex (ecstasy, annoyance, rage, unhappiness, manipulative pouting, indifference), wasn't quite sure where to place Hermione's expression.</p><p>James - he knew - was easy to read. His friend was looking down at the curly-haired girl, his lips pulled back into an easy, confident smile and his hazel eyes - from what Sirius could see - were bright. Even his pose, although dominating Hermione's tiny frame, was open and relaxed. It was a look that Sirius rarely saw in his friend, except around those he felt the most comfortable around; people he could be himself without the big, bold, brash Gryffindor personality he had adopted.</p><p><em>But Hermione? </em>Sirius shook his head.</p><p>It almost looked like amused fondness.</p><p>Which would be weird, considering that the Evans sisters disliked James; particularly Lily. And from what Sirius knew, Hermione didn't mind tutoring James in Arithmancy, but she wouldn't go out of her way to speak to him outside of the library.</p><p>Except... she was.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>June 1976</strong>
</p><p>And then, it was time for the fifth years to write their OWLs.</p><p>Hermione knew it was coming. She knew that nothing she could've done in this timeline would have prevented what was to be - Snape being an idiot and her sister being stubborn, and throwing away his friendship while he took the necessary steps that brought him closer and closer to the man she knew in her future.</p><p>Long after Severus Snape died, and the war was over, Harry had divulged to her and Ron that he had gone into the man's pensieve and seen the memory of his fifth year OWL exam and the aftermath, including a vague explanation of how his friendship ended with Lily Evans. But Harry had been shady on the details, still respecting that man's privacy a decade and a half after his death.</p><p>So, while Hermione was aware, on some level, of <em>something</em> that would happen, she was… unprepared for how bad it was actually was.</p><p>Unlike the fifth years, the fourth years still has classes to attend while the others wrote their exams in the Great Hall (with the exceptions of her writing her NEWTs in Arithmancy and Charms, which she did in Professor Janus and Professor Flitwick's offices, respectively).</p><p>She had just finished her Charms NEWT, completely and utterly confident in her abilities given that she had over three decades ahead of what the examiner expected of her. As such, she was walking down towards the Black Lake to meet Barty and Regulus once they finished with Potions (as Slughorn happily told her to skip his class for her exams. Two words: <em>Slug Club</em>). She arrived at her spot well ahead of her friends,</p><p>She sat on a comfortable patch of grass near the Lake and sat down a soft mound banking the lake that hid her from the quad and courtyards outside the Entrance Hall, cross-legged with her skirt modestly tucked around her knees. It was her favourite place outside to conduct her experiments, near the Lake for water, but surrounded by earth and hidden from nosey classmates unless someone knew where to look for her - like Barty and Regulus, the former who practically tumbled down the mound.</p><p>"Hermione!" greeted Barty loudly, flinging himself onto the grass beside her.</p><p>"Hey," she said, turning partially to look at him as he sprawled against the mound in a reclining position, using his Hogwarts blazer as a pillow beneath his head. "How was Potions?"</p><p>"Tolerable," said Regulus with a sigh as he pulled out his wand, cast a cushioning charm on the ground, and then primly sat.</p><p>"Only tolerable?" teased Hermione, a glint in her eyes.</p><p>Barty rolled his. "You know that he asked Reg to join his Slug Club. Again."</p><p>"It's <em>embarrassing</em>," replied Regulus with a slight whine to his voice. "You know he just wants the Black name. And he'll never ask Sirius after he blew up his potions for an entire year... deliberately."</p><p>Hermione chuckled and Barty sighed as he stretched his arms up, looking very much like a long, lounging cat.</p><p>Regulus, keeping his posture perfect, pulled the very same flower he once gave Calypso from his bag and began spinning it in absent-minded circles as his thoughts turned inward. Finally, he felt Hermione's eyes on him and asked, "Have you done more? Of your transmutations?"</p><p>"I was going to practice," admitted Hermione. "Did you want to see? I think I have an idea of what to do."<br />"Do?" asked Barty, his eyes peeking open.</p><p>"Beyond flowers and transmutation circles," explained Hermione, looking down at her hands. "I think I can do it without them now."</p><p>Regulus's eyebrows shot up. He leaned forward, no longer twirling the flower. "If you did that - that would be beyond anything - it would -"</p><p>"Practically change magic," breathed Barty, eyes wide.</p><p>Hermione looked away, bashfully as a blush stole across his cheeks. "We don't know that I can manage. It's been months since I had the last breakthrough -"</p><p>"You can," promised Regulus, his plump Pureblood tones softening. "Believe in yourself."</p><p>Hermione nodded and tilted her head back and she took in the warmth of the June sun on her face and shoulders. Deep breaths as she inhaled and exhaled escaped her, and she felt peace settle over her like a comfortable blanket.</p><p>After a few moments, she rolled up her sleeves to her elbows and ran her fingers through the grass, where white sparks crackled and popped and spread around in front of her, like a spider web as the ground rose and fell in gentle, rolling waves just like the lake before her.</p><p>Hermione grinned. <em>Holy shit. I did it! Like in the Room of Requirement!</em></p><p>"Merlin," she heard Regulus breath out, awe lacing his voice.</p><p>"I <em>knew</em> she could do it," she heard Barty mutter proudly.</p><p>She stared at the earth as it moved before her, stationary instead of spreading out across the grounds, but with a gentle motion that determined her control over the element. This was no reanimation or rebirth of a flower - she was actively engaging with and manipulating the ground.</p><p>With a rush of adrenaline through her, she spread the fingers on her hands and clenched them at once, bringing both fists up and watched as the earth followed her movements, rising like a podium. As soon as she let go of her fists and dropped her hands, the earth stand collapsed.</p><p>This was a kind of magic she had never seen before, even between Dumbledore and Voldemort in their duels, or Harry and Voldemort; this was the magic she hypothesized while working at the Ministry in her forties. This was magic of a different kind - wandless, elemental, but deeply rooted in understanding the scientific base of everything around her.</p><p>She was flushed and breathless with pleasure at her accomplishment and breakthrough.</p><p>And it was only then, as she came down from her high, that she heard the loud laughs and chatter from the other students as they exited their exams.</p><p>Hermione met Barty and Regulus's eyes, and, they turned as one, together twisting and crawling up the mound to see whether anyone was inadvertently going to find their hidden spot. Hermione poked her head from the earth and looked around at the gathering of students, many not wearing their Hogwarts robes in the warm weather.</p><p>A group of girls on the other side of the mound were cooling their feet in the water; one she recognized as her sister with her bright red hair shining in the June sunlight. Nearly a hundred meters down from the shoreline where she was hidden in the opposite direction, was a beech tree that she once sat under with Harry and Ron, but was currently occupied by the Marauders. Remus had a book out, engrossed in it; James was playing with a snitch, completely taken by tossing it up and catching it just as Peter was watching him; Sirius, however...</p><p>With Hermione, Regulus and Barty caught between the two groups, she turned her direction to see what the Black heir was staring at, like a dog that scented a rabbit - and spotted Severus Snape, fifth year Slytherin and one of the few students still in his Hogwarts robes, settled by a nearby clump of bushes, trying to remain cool in their meagre shade. He was directly opposite them, in a strange triangular shape.</p><p>Something heavy settled in Hermione's stomach. <em>Oh. Oh, dear.</em></p><p>Regulus muttered a charm, and then, like a bubble settling over the three of them, they could hear what his brother and friends were saying.</p><p>"This'll liven you up, Prongs," Sirius muttered, causing James to sigh. He stopped playing with his snitch. "Look who it is…"</p><p>James obediently looked in the direction that Sirius suggested. "So? It's Snape. And he's leaving."</p><p>Sure enough, Hermione glanced back at the Slytherin and saw he was getting to his feet, shoving an OWL examination paper in his side bag.</p><p>Sirius gapped. "Mate? It's <em>Snivellus</em>. C'mon!"</p><p>As Snape left the shadows of the bush, Sirius bounded forward a few steps. James shot to his feet, grabbing the snitch and shoving it in a pocket. Remus remained looking at his book but this time he was staring at it furiously, a furrow between his brows while Peter was looking eagerly between Sirius, James, and Snape as if wondering what would happen next.</p><p>"All right Snivellus?" shouted Sirius, drawing everyone's attention that was within hearing range.</p><p>At her side, Regulus slowly shut his eyes, painfully; Barty's were narrowed - Hermione knew he never had any strong positive feelings toward him anyway - and, on Hermione's other side, she saw her sister get to her feet, just as her girl friends stopped gossiping and talking. Many others were standing as well, water sluicing down their bare legs.</p><p>And yet, in the span of Hermione taking everything in, Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting the attack; he dropped his bag, plunged his hand in his robes, and his wand was halfway up and in a wide arc when Sirius shouted, "<em>Expelliarmus</em>!"</p><p>The Slytherin's wand flew in the air and landed some twelve feet, with a thud on the grass near Barty, who eyed it with distaste.</p><p>Sirius let out a bark of laughter and shouted another spell. Snape, who had dived forward for his wand, was knocked back and landed with a skid in the grass, getting long, green grass stains on his Hogwarts robes. His face was flushed red when he looked up and spotted the three of them directly ahead. Fury and shame broke across his face as he realized he was the focus of so much attention.</p><p>A crowd was beginning to form.</p><p>Sirius advanced, wand aloft. James trailed after him, muttering, "Sirius, Padfoot - stop this. What are you doing?"</p><p>"C'mon, mate!" grinned Sirius, although it looked strained. "You've been out of sorts since January. Putting Snivellus in his place will do you a load of good, yeah? It always makes me feel better."</p><p>James's eyes narrowed from behind his glasses and he stopped walking. "Is that why you're doing this? Because of <em>me</em>?"</p><p>Sirius whirled around to stare at his friend. "You <em>must</em> admit that you haven't been acting normally, Jimmy. At all. C'mon - where's the showmanship that I know so well? The Gryffindor who is brave and daring? Who looks cool for Evans?"</p><p>At that, James nervously glanced over his shoulder toward the water where Lily was beginning to take little slow, worried steps forward. He glanced around, taking in the crowd, and then, when his eyes were wandering back to his friends, he saw Hermione, Barty, and Regulus watching, from where they stood on their steeply banked mound. He winced.</p><p>Peter was on his feet and Remus had abandoned the pretense of reading his book, merely staring down at the pages.</p><p>"How'd the exam go, Snivelly?" continued Sirius, a nasty tone to his voice.</p><p>Hermione breathed deeply, trying to remember he was fifteen and stupid, and not the man at thirty-seven who died protecting Harry in the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>"I was watching him!" piped up Peter, joining the two black-haired teens as he sidled up next to James. He glanced up at them, not even looking at Snape. The mousy, curly-haired thin teen was sniggering. "His nose was touching the parchment. There'll be grease marks all over it. I doubt the professors will be able to read a word!"</p><p>Several people watching laughed. Hermione frowned.</p><p>"Berk," muttered Barty under his breath.</p><p>Snape, still facing their direction, struggled to get up even as his eyes were cut towards the Gryffindors. The jinx held him and, with a slight sigh, Barty twitched his fingers, his own magic counteracting Sirius's own spell.</p><p>Immediately, Snape's body relaxed; yet in opposition, his eyes widened in panic as he tried to figure out what happened, to figure out who had broken the jinx and what it meant for him. Was another attack coming?</p><p>"Oh, well done," murmured Hermione to Barty, who glanced at her and preened, a pleased smile stretching across his face. "Your wandless spells are coming along nicely - I hadn't realized you were able to cast a <em>finite</em> from this distance."</p><p>Regulus nodded at Hermione's other side in agreement.</p><p>Slowly, Snape got to his feet, inching a bit towards his wand.</p><p>"Just wait," he snarled with an expression of pure loathing through heavy, panted breaths, causing James, Sirius, and Peter to whirl and face him. Sirius was shocked to see him on his feet. "Just - you - wait!"</p><p>Sirius' shocked face morphed into disdain. "Wait for what? What are you going to do, Snivelly? Wipe your nose on us?"</p><p>Snape let out an expressive and expansive list of swear words and curses in his thick Yorkshire accent that impressed Hermione. "Blimey," she said.</p><p>At her side, Barty nodded emphatically. "Are you recording this, Reg? Please tell me you are. I need to remember some of those to us when I'm home for the summer."</p><p>In response, Regulus rolled his eyes expressively with a slight scowl.</p><p>"Snape," said James suddenly, "Watch your mouth - there are first years out here."</p><p>"What a good idea, Prongsie," grinned Sirius devilishly. Then he cast <em>scourgify</em>, hitting Snape directly in the face as pink bubbles streamed from his mouth at once. The froth was thick, covering his lips, making him choke, gagging.</p><p>Hermione winced.</p><p>"<em>Leave him alone</em>!"</p><p>"<em>Fuccccccckkkk</em>," she moaned, turning to see her sister striding forward from the Lake's edge.</p><p>Both Regulus and Barty turned to her as one, just as Sirius, Peter, and James turned to face the other Evans sister striding forward, his face flushed and the colour clashing with her vibrant hair.</p><p>"What's it to you, Evans?" asked Sirius, nonchalantly, but his eyes were off to the side, on James, who froze. Sirius has a calculating look on his face, something alien that Hermione had never seen before.</p><p>James's hand twitched at his side, unsure if it should go to his hair or not as Lily stopped a few metres from them. Instead, he clenched his fist and kept it at his side as Remus began to inch forward, his own eyes wide and focused on the Marauder's ringleader.</p><p>Lily was focused on Sirius. "Leave him alone," she repeated.</p><p>"This is <em>not </em>going to go well," muttered Regulus, cancelling the eavesdropping spell as there was no need - everyone within a hundred foot radius was watching rapturously and it was so silent that their conversation was easily heard. "Sirius doesn't like being told what to do."</p><p>"Yeah, I remember," said Hermione, pursing her lips, thinking back to the weeks when he stalked her. "I'm going to go out there."</p><p>Barty's head whipped around to stare at her. "What for? You could get caught in the middle of them! Or hit by a spell!"</p><p>"I think I'll be fine," she replied, stepping forward and sliding away from Barty's outstretched hand.</p><p>Lily had continued speaking, and Hermione managed to be within two feet of her as Peter answered, "-the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean…"</p><p>Those around them laughed, except for Hermione, Lily (who looked murderous towards Peter and Sirius), Remus, who clenched his hands on his book, and, surprisingly, James, who was nervously looking around.</p><p>"I suppose you think that was funny," said Hermione, pitching her voice so that everyone heard.</p><p>There was some silence and awkward shifting, and someone even said, heard by all, "Who's the Ravenclaw?"</p><p>"Hermione," sputtered James, blinking. This time, his hand flew up and he ran it through his hair, messing it up, and then he did it again. "All right? How did your NEWT go?"</p><p>Hermione glanced toward him and then to her sister, who was staring at James in bewilderment. Then, after a moment, she shook her head, as if clearing her mind, and faced Sirius once more, speaking coolly. "You're just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Black. You take your own insecurities and mummy and daddy issues out on anyone you can to make yourself feel better. Pathetic."</p><p>Hermione winced. "Lily - I don't think that was the best-"</p><p>James tried, too. "Padfoot - she doesn't know anything - honest -"</p><p>But Sirius's face turned splotchy red. "My own insecurities, Evans? Really? Then let's have a chat, shall we? Let's talk about the fact that no one in the school even knows about Hermione, hmm?"</p><p>"What?" Lily rocked back a bit, blinking.</p><p>He nodded in her direction, and Hermione froze. "You know, right Evans? Your <em>little sister</em>. In Ravenclaw? You ashamed of her or something?"</p><p>There was some muttering around the crowd, and Hermione's eyes darted around as she caught a few snippets.</p><p>"<em>-a sister?"</em></p><p>"<em>Ravenclaw? She must be smart-"</em></p><p>"<em>Maybe Evans felt threatened?"</em></p><p>"<em>What a bitch."</em></p><p>"<em>Oh Merlin, there's two of the Mudbloods…"</em></p><p>Hermione felt like the earth had opened up under her. It was one thing to throw herself out there and be comfortable with her position in this life - but that was because <em>she </em>was in control of who she spent time with and who got to know her. She was comfortable with Barty and Regulus; and, even to some degree, James and vaguely Sirius. But… <em>this?</em></p><p>She could feel the pinpricks of dozens of eyes suddenly on her, and the cloak of invisibility that she had wrapped around her as security and comfort be ripped off painfully. She shuddered.</p><p>"Don't make this about me," snapped back Lily, but there was a tremble in her voice and a sheen to her eyes as she panicked and looked around, her eyes avoiding Hermione completely. "This is about you. You attacking my friend."</p><p>Sirius scoffed.</p><p>"Tell you what, Evans," the Gryffindor drawled, spinning his wand lazily. "Since <em>I</em> am apparently a keen observer and we all know that my best friend - my brother in all but name - fancies you, let's make a deal. Go out with him, a real proper date like he's wanted for years, and not only will I never lay a wand on old Snivelly again, I won't mention what a shite sister you are."</p><p>It was Lily's turn to freeze as the air was sucked out of the area around them. There was a strange buzzing noise in the air, and Hermione swayed slightly as her heartbeat quickened and her palms began to sweat. There was a terse, crackling feeling in the air.</p><p>Yet, in all this time, no one was looking at Snape, who had used it to his advantage, crawling toward his wand, the frothing soap in his mouth beginning to dwindle and leaving him looking less rabid.</p><p>"I wouldn't go out with Potter if he were the last man on earth," declared Lily, finally. She tilted her chin up and tossed her shoulder-length hair back.</p><p>Sirius eyed her. "So you wouldn't take one for the team, eh, Evans? Not to help your so-called <em>best friend</em>? To let your <em>sister </em>know you care about her? Some loyalty you have. I guess that's why you're not in Hufflepuff."</p><p>Lily bristled.</p><p>"Bad luck, Prongs," continued Sirius briskly. "Guess you've got your answered there and are a free agent once more." With that, he turned back to Snape, eyes growing wide. "<em>Oi</em>!"</p><p>But Snape had reached his wand and directed it towards the three teens standing together; there was a flash of light as it burst from his wand and, in his anger, it veered widely away from Sirius and Peter toward James.</p><p>With a heavy inhale through her nose, Hermione whipped her hand out and up; the ground before James's feet trembled and then a sheet of solid earth rose up, a thin rectangular that, when the light hit it, dashed it and sent bits crumbling to the ground as it collapsed. Yet, the spell dissipated upon hitting something - its target.</p><p>James, standing behind the sheet of compact dirt, stared. Slowly, he turned his head to face Hermione. She, in response, quickly slipped her wand into her hand to make it appear as if she had cast a spell, especially as others caught on that she blocked Snape's attack.</p><p>Sirius whirled, his own eyes wide and frantic as he looked his best friend over for a cut, blood, anything - but then he whirled around just as quickly, toward Snape. Then the Slytherin was hanging upside down in the air, his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of greying underpants; he wasn't wearing the pressed trousers or Muggle-styled uniform under.</p><p>Many people in the crowd roared with laughter, including Sirius and Peter. Hermione winced, involuntarily taking a step forward, which put her level to her sister, whose furious expression twitched - and Hermione stared hard at her profile.</p><p><em>Were you… were you about to </em>smile? thought Hermione, eyes growing wide. <em>This is your best friend! If Malfoy had </em>ever<em> thought of doing something like this to Ron or Harry, I would have cheerfully snuck into the Slytherin dormitory and risked expulsion to avenge them. And here you are, sister, thinking someone else's suffering is okay? He hasn't even said - that word - yet, if the memory continues to play out</em>.</p><p>Disgust stole over her face, and Hermione strode forward, overtaking her sister who remained in place. Behind her, she could hear Barty and Regulus muttering and then one was scrambling after her. She knew it was Barty - Regulus had to maintain some Slytherin objective.</p><p>With a cut of her wand, the <em>levicorpus</em> spell - ironically Snape's own invention - broke and he crashed to the ground; behind her, she heard Barty mutter a cushioning charm. She glanced back and nodded in appreciation and he gave her a tight, grim smile.</p><p>Righting himself and his robes, Snape got to his feet, wand up; just as Sirius opened his mouth,</p><p>"ENOUGH!" roared Hermione, inserting herself between the two as Barty squawked and James jerked forward. She glanced between the two as Sirius froze and snapped his mouth shut. "This has gone on long<em> enough</em>!"</p><p>Sirius eyed her warily. "Princess... don't make me hex you. Get out of the way. This is between me and Snivelly."</p><p>"This is between <em>both </em>of your ridiculous egos and pathetic need for validation," snapped Hermione, facing Sirius. "But it is <em>enough</em> now. You're done, Sirius. Walk away. Be the bigger man."</p><p>There was a terse silence in the crowd; Lily began to wring her hands, glancing between Snape and Hermione and then Sirius. Sirius himself was staring at Hermione, frowning like he couldn't quite figure something out - and James, his mouth had dropped open for a brief moment, and then snapped shut so quickly and tightly Hermione could hear the sound where she stood between the two teens, as well as see the accompanying tense jaw he was working.</p><p>Finally - finally, Sirius lowered his wand.</p><p>Next to Lily, Barty let out a loud sigh of relief.</p><p>"All right, Evans," he said, slowly. "All right." He turned to Snape, shaking his head. "You're lucky that Hermione was here, Snivellus-"</p><p>"I don't need help from filthy know-it-all Mudbloods like her!"</p><p>Hermione blinked. <em>Oh, wow. It… still happened. Just… not with Lily. Hmm.</em></p><p>"APOLOGIZE TO HERMIONE!" roared James, and then he was brushing past Sirius, striding forward with his wand ablaze, its tip pulsing angrily with a spell he hadn't yet unleashed until he was nearly at her side. His face was incredibly flushed in his anger, his hair far more windswept than normal as his magic crackled around him.</p><p>Hermione turned and pressed up against his chest with both her hands, pushing him back so that he stumbled a step, but his eyes were locked on the Slytherin.</p><p>"Are you <em>kidding </em>me? Potter - James -" Hermione shook her head. "I don't need a knight in armour, here. Drop it."</p><p>Jaw tensing, James glanced down at her, his hazel eyes furious. "He called you a <em>you-know-what</em>! How dare he!"</p><p>Hermione raised her eyebrows at him. "Does it <em>look</em> like I'm upset?"</p><p>James paused, reaching for her with his non-wand hand and gripping her arm, just by her elbow. His fingers slipped under her shirt's rolled-up sleeve and she fought against a shiver. "What?"</p><p>His eyes darted back and forth between hers, taking in her relaxed stance, the way she wasn't reacting to the slur. But, behind them, Lily gave a tiny mocking laugh. "Well. I certainly won't be sticking around if that's how you truly think of us Muggleborn. And I'd wash your pants, if I were you, <em>Snivellus</em>."</p><p>Hermione and James spun as one to stare at Lily, his hand clenching around her arm in response. Her eyes were narrowed firmly in her (ex?)friends' direction, but then they turned to James.</p><p>"And <em>you</em> -" she began. "I don't want <em>you</em> to make him apologize. You're as bad as he is!"</p><p>James sputtered. "I beg your pardon-" just as Hermione snapped, "Lily!"</p><p>But she rolled her eyes. "Please. Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your broomstick-"</p><p>Hermione frowned as she thought back to his nervous hand running through his hair. Apparently, it wasn't <em>all </em>nerves, then.</p><p>"-Showing off with that stupid snitch, walking down the corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can-"</p><p>Her frown deepened. <em>Was he? He </em>was?</p><p>"-I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me <em>sick</em>!" Lily shouted the last part, breathing heavily. Then she turned on her heel and strode off, towards the Entrance Hall. Those in her way, part of the surrounding crowd, scrambling over themselves to part for her.</p><p>A few of her girl friends from Gryffindor, the other girls watching by the lake, took off after her. "Lily! Lily, wait!"</p><p>"What's with her?" muttered Sirius, but still loud enough for those hanging around to hear.</p><p>"When did this become about <em>me</em>?" muttered James, his voice annoyed. His hand reflexively twitched and Hermione glanced down at it. He followed her eyes and removed his hand, jerking back like it burned. He took several steps away from her. "Sorry."</p><p>"Sounds to me like she thinks you're conceited, Prongs," said Peter, his mouth turned down. "And that Padfoot has deep-rooted psychological issues toward his parents."</p><p>"Right," breathed Sirius, heavily through his nose as his nostrils flared.</p><p>"Sirius -" warned Hermione, eyes flashing, "Don't-"</p><p>"Don't tell me what to do, Evans," he snapped back, looking furious.</p><p>His wand inched up, aimed toward her, and then Barty was there, his own pointed at Sirius, and Regulus was on Hermione's other side, but his wand was pointed down. There was an edge to his eyes though, and a nasty threatening cadence to his voice when he said, "Hello, brother."</p><p>Sirius swallowed thickly, staring at his brother for several long moments, and then he turned - too quickly for Hermione to follow and there was another flash. Snape was once again upside down and Sirius was taunting, "Who wants to see me take Snivelly's pants off?"</p><p>"<em>Oh my God</em>," moaned Hermione. She cut her hand through the air like Barty had, and again, Snape fell to the ground. This time, there were tears gathering in his eyes and he was flushed very red against his pale face.</p><p>Sirius turned to face Hermione. "You've had enough chances, Evans. You want a fight? Fine."</p><p>"Sirius!" snapped James. "That's enough! Stop it! You're not angry with her. You're not even angry with Snape! Let it be!"</p><p>"If you want a fight, Black," jeered Hermione, narrowing her eyes, "I'm happy to oblige." She then gave him a tiny little smirk, knowingly pushing his buttons.</p><p>Barty moaned.</p><p>Breathing heavily, Sirius stared at her. Then he was stalking forward, James on his heels, until he stopped nose-to-nose with her. Sirius was, and always had been, a tall man and as a teenager, he towered over her. But Hermione let her head tip back and she even smiled placidly up at him.</p><p>Grey eyes catching hers, he leaned forward a bit more and breathed, "Midnight. Shrieking Shack. And you'd better come alone, Evans. I'll <em>know</em>."</p><p>Behind her, James stood, horrified.</p><p>But Sirius had strode off, also toward the Entrance Hall, with Peter following him. Remus, looking peaky and ill, kept looking between him and James, Hermione, Regulus, and Barty where they stood. None of the crowd had heard, except them.</p><p>"You won't let him do this, will you?" the werewolf muttered anxiously at James. "James? Will you?"</p><p>"I-"</p><p>But he shook his head, torn, and then was walking away, past Snape without a word as the other teen glared at him. But Snape did not raise his wand. Sensing the fight was over without further retaliation from anyone involved, the crowd began to disperse.</p><p>"Please tell me you're not going to go," begged Barty, leaning down a bit to look at Hermione with wide brown eyes.</p><p>Hermione rolled them. "He's spoiling for a fight. And in the meantime between now and then, he'll just rack himself up. It's best I do."</p><p>"But -"</p><p>"Barty," said Hermione, "I can handle him. You know I can. You <em>both</em> do," she turned to catch Regulus's frown. "And I won't hurt him."</p><p>"But why'd he suggest the Shrieking Shack?" asked Regulus slowly. "And you won't go alone, will you?"</p><p>"I will," she nodded, and they slowly began to walk back to their banked mound to collect their bags. "And as for the location…"</p><p>She trailed off and then looked up at the sunny sky, where the full moon would later hang. "I have a good idea as to why."</p><hr /><p align="center">

  <strong>June 1976</strong>
</p><p>The boys’ dormitory in Gryffindor was filled with a tense sort of quiet. None of them had attended dinner -- Remus was feeling too sickly to eat, with the oncoming moon; James and Sirius were too furious for hunger, and Peter had followed along.</p><p>Now, the four were in their room, hastily thrown up silencing spells layered through practice from four wands to blot the sound of the Common Room (and their room) out. Remus, pale grey in the face and sweaty, sank to the floor at the foot of his bed and cradled his head in his folded arms as his knees came up -- James sent him a worried look, swallowing thickly at the obvious display of nerves. His eyes then darted to Sirius, who, despite the toss of his head and the upturned, stubborn chin, kept glancing worriedly at Remus. Peter stood near Sirius, warily looking between him and James, and was slowly edging to his bed.</p><p>James, however, stood in the middle of the room, arms crossed. Finally, he inhaled deeply in the tense silence of the room. He tried to handle his anger -- his fear, his worry -- by counting his breaths.</p><p>In. <em>One, two, three.</em></p><p>Out. <em>One, two three. </em></p><p>In. <em>One, two --</em></p><p><em>WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?”</em> the worlds exploded out of James’s mouth in a breathless rush, aimed directly at Sirius who flinched, his shoulders hunching just a bit like a shocked, misbehaving dog. “Oh -- I’ll <em>tell</em> you -- you <em>weren’t!</em> How could you, Sirius?! How could you do this to Remus?”</p><p>Bitterly, Sirius mumbled, “Don’t you mean Hermione?”</p><p>James pinched the bridge of his nose, riding his glasses up a bit as he did so. “Sirius. You are putting our <em>best friend</em> at jeopardy because -- for some strange reason -- you have a grudge against a <em>fourteen-year-old</em>.”</p><p>“She’s not fourteen,” he replied petulantly, “She had a birthday in September.”</p><p> James stared at him, and even Remus wearily raised his head from the comforting protection of his arms to share in James’s befuddled and exasperated look.</p><p>“I beg your pardon?” sputtered James, blinking.</p><p>Sirius’s cheeks turned red. He then exhaled and cut a hand through the air. “Look -- it doesn’t matter okay? I did what was right. And she’s not going to show anyway, so who cares? It wasn’t meant for her anyway.”</p><p><em>Not meant for her…?</em> James’s eyes shut slowly and painfully as he squeezed them against the realization that there were a few others within hearing distance when Sirius had said that. <em>And as far as I know, he wouldn’t do anything to hurt his brother, and I doubt that he knows Crouch’s name...</em></p><p>“Sirius. Please. <em>Please</em> tell me this still isn’t about Snape.”</p><p>The teen in question scoffed. “When <em>isn’t </em>it about Snivellus?”</p><p>Remus groaned from his position on the floor. Peter’s eyes were wide as they darted back and forth between the two black-haired teens.</p><p>James did his best to not launch himself across the floor and tackle Sirius in order to pummel him. His anger made his hands shake and he breathed deeply as he tried to maintain his composure. “<em>Sirius</em>. There is no reason to keep antagonizing Snape--”</p><p>“Of course there is,” broke in the Black teen, “I have about a dozen springing to mind right now--”</p><p>Peter snickered.</p><p>“--when he hasn’t done anything -- er, for the most part -- to provoke it,” continued speaking James over Sirius, raising his voice. “It’s different if he sends a spell to you first, Sirius, but to continue to bother him--”</p><p>“--I can do what I want, James--”</p><p>“--I’m not saying that you <em>can’t</em>, Sirius--”</p><p>“--Oh? Because my ears are hearing something very different--”</p><p>“--<em>No one is telling you what to do </em>-- I’m telling you to be careful--”</p><p>“--I’m careful--”</p><p>Remus snorted.</p><p>“--Not careful enough, Sirius! Not when you’re telling Hermione or Snape to go to the Shrieking Shack on a full moon!”</p><p>“Oh, come off it, Jimmy,” sighed Sirius with an expressive eye roll, flopping down on his bed in one move, “I said it before; Evans won’t go. And while Snape’s curiosity will take him to the Shack, we’ll make sure he doesn’t get too close--”</p><p>“Really?” James’s stare was hard on Sirius. “Are you <em>sure</em>? Because it really sounds to me like you’re setting Snape up to be murdered by <em>our friend</em>.”</p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t complain if he was permanently out of the way,” replied Sirius airily, Peter nodding along.</p><p>“Sirius!” both James and Remus were aghast and their cries reflected that.</p><p>The teen shrugged and reached for a discarded magazine on his night table, beginning to flip through it. James was not fooled by the nonchalant act, as Sirius’s shoulders were still very tense and his body was held rigidly on the bed.</p><p>“Sirius, please tell me you don’t want Remus to be used as a--” he struggled for a word, before blurting, “A-- a <em>murder weapon</em> to get rid of Snape because you’re jealous of him!”</p><p>“Jealous?” scoffed Sirius, but there was a brittle quality to his voice. “Me? Ha! Jealous. Please.”</p><p>The silence in the room suggested that Remus, James, and Peter thought otherwise.</p><p>When no one spoke, Sirius tossed his magazine down on the bed and stared hard at his friends. "Why would <em>I</em> be jealous of Snivelly?”</p><p>Despite the waxy sheen to Remus’s face, his voice was all snark when he replied, “Oh, I don’t know, Padfoot -- maybe because he’s in Slytherin and has parental approval? Or that he’s a Halfblood and still seems to have some sort of friend circle? I mean, it’s not like <em>you</em> sling nasty Dark magic at him when he does the same back to you, or anything like that--”</p><p>“I’m not a Dark wizard!” shouted Sirius, rising to his feet and face red as he stared down his werewolf.</p><p>Remus’s stare was bland, just as his reply. “Of course you’re not.”</p><p>Through his teeth, Sirius gritted, “Is that sarcasm, Moony?”</p><p>James sighed, his voice cracking with the strain as he spoke. “Sirius -- <em>please</em>.”</p><p>Sirius turned to his best friend, his brother in all but blood (although, they were cousins, so blood related as well), and met his hazel eyes. Although his blood was still boiling from the insults his friends hurtled at him -- the fact that two had even <em>done so</em> had Sirius stop and think, shortly, that maybe -- maybe -- he was in the wrong -- and he took a deep breath in reply.</p><p>“James,” pled Sirius, grey eyes wide and earnest. “You <em>know</em> me. I’m not a Dark wizard -- I’m not like my family! You know that! I don’t like Snivel--er… <em>Snape</em>--”</p><p>Remus snorted.</p><p>Sirius shot a glare at him. “--Okay, so I <em>hate</em> the bugger, fine, happy now, Moony? But I’m not a murderer. I’m not!”</p><p>James glanced at Remus who shrugged. Peter remained silent, happy to be out of the way while his friends worked things out between them, as his opinions tended to be more aligned with Sirius’s but given how Remus and James were going after him, Peter wisely kept silent.</p><p>Turning back to Sirius, James said, pointedly, “Then prove me wrong and go find Snape. Stop him from going to the Shack tonight.”</p><p>Sirius’s pleading face drained and he nearly rolled his lower lip in to chew nervously on it. “But what if he tells people about Moony?”</p><p>James blinked. “Is <em>that</em> what this is about? You were planning on getting Snape seriously hurt because you’re afraid he’ll tell someone that there is a werewolf at Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Moony could be expelled, or hurt,” argued Sirius, his voice small.</p><p>Remus growled, “Moony could <em>still</em> be hurt or expelled tonight because of your stupidity, Sirius! Merlin!” the sandy-haired teen shot to his feet and, with a renewed vigor, snapped, “I’m going to see Madam Pomfrey and then heading to the Shack. For God’s Sake, Sirius!” he turned to his friend, sliding into blasphemy from his mother’s Muggle upbringing, “<em>FIX THIS</em>.”</p><p>Remus stormed out of the dorm. With a glance between the two, Peter scurried after him, calling, “Remus! Wait for me!”</p><p>James waited a few moments, letting the silence linger a bit longer in the room as some of the tension bleed with the removal of Remus and Peter. Finally feeling like he might find the underlying cause of things, because there was more than what Sirius was saying, James asked, quietly, “It’s more than just Snape, isn’t it? You’ve been out of sorts since January.”</p><p>Sirius turned his face and eyes from his friend and moved to his bed, smoothing the duvet and fussing over it.</p><p>“Don’t avoid, Sirius.”</p><p>The dog animagus sighed. “You don’t want to hear what I’m going to say.”</p><p>“You’re my brother; of <em>course</em> I want to hear what you say.” James took a few steps forward and placed a hand on his friends’ shoulder. “Even if I dislike it.”</p><p>Sirius tensed under the hand, but then sighed heavily, and his shoulders fell. “You’ve changed.”</p><p>“Changed?” shock laced through James’s voice. “How?”</p><p>Sirius’s look was dry, an unsaid <em>really?</em> sent to James, indicating how dumb he thought that question was. When James failed to respond, Sirius sighed heavily. “Jimmy -- James -- how can you <em>not</em> see? When was the last time you went after Evans?”</p><p><em>“Went after Hermione?”</em> yipped James in shock, eyes and mouth wide as he nearly tripped on nothing, a stumble backward into the bed’s poster.</p><p>“No, not Hermione,” ground out Sirius, rolling his eyes to the ceiling. “Although that completely proves my point. Not so long ago you would have mentioned <em>Lily</em> when I said ‘Evans.’ Now, your first thought is to her younger sister.”</p><p>“I--” James snapped his mouth shut. There was a vaguely panicked look forming on his face as his eyes darted around the room and sweat began to bead at his hairline. His cheeks flushed a light pink.</p><p>“James,” said Sirius, quite seriously, “Do you fancy Hermione?”</p><p>“Sirius! Merlin!” yanking at his collar, James’s eyes slid away and toward his messy bed. His heart began to race. “What hogwash.”</p><p>“<em>Mmhmm</em>.”</p><p><em>Me? Fancy Hermione? </em>Mentally, James scoffed, ignoring the furious racing of his pulse and the sudden sweat that raced down his spine. <em>She’s a good friend and she’s helped me do well on my Arithmancy work, that’s all. Of course, there was that kiss at New Years -- and she’s a good laugh -- no. No, I don’t fancy her. She’s bloody scary -- I </em>admire<em> her.</em></p><p>“I think you’re barking up the wrong tree, Padfoot,” replied James finally, his voice low and tone stern enough that the conversation was closed.</p><p>Sirius’s eyebrows shot up, but he kept his mouth shut. James could read his thoughts clearly on his best friends’ skeptical face, though; it read <em>you’re not fooling anyone</em>.</p><p>Frustration bubbled up. With a glance away from his friend (he wasn’t avoiding, at all!), James watched the sun’s descent.</p><p>James said crossly, “Anyway -- it’s getting close to dinner and soon Moony will be heading to the Shack with Wormtail. Don’t you think you have someone you need to find to stop them from being mauled or killed?”</p><p>The vague mirth in Sirius’s face quickly faded to annoyance.</p><p>“Merlin, James, suck the fun out of it, why don’t you?” he muttered, but listened to the silent suggestion, moving away from his bed and past his friend as he headed for the door. He grabbed a discarded jacket of Remus’s, neatly hanging on a hook and swung it up and around as he smoothly stuck his arms through the sleeves. He was still muttering under his breath as he left the dormitory, leaving James alone.</p><p>For several long seconds, James held perfectly still, eyes forward as his ears strained for noise but the silencing spells they wove held. There was nothing but his harsh breathing, which increased its pace until he was almost panting nervously. Snapping his mouth shut upon realizing his quick breaths, he inhaled deeply and closed his eyes.</p><p>
  <em>I do not fancy Hermione Evans. I fancy Lily. I do not fancy Hermione Evans. I fancy Lily. </em>
</p><p>It became a mantra in his mind, looping and littering his brain as he repeated the sentences repeatedly as he calmed his racing heart: <em>I do not fancy Hermione Evans. I fancy Lily. I do not fancy Hermione Evans. I fancy Lily. </em></p><p>Soon, his sweaty palms were dry, and his breaths were even and regulated. The sun was barely peeking over the mountain range beyond the Forbidden Forest, and soon the moon would be up. Remus, Sirius, and Peter would be waiting for him at the Shack, and the thought of leaving Moony alone without Prongs was an ache in his heart.</p><p>Turning, James made his way out of the dorm, taking the stone steps carefully and evenly as the mantra continued. <em>I do not fancy Hermione Evans. I fancy Lily. </em></p><p>However, at the foot of the stairs, he realized that those in the busy common room were rooted in spot; some blushing furiously and keeping their eyes forward or on books or their game of Gobstones while others were facing the girls’ dorm unashamedly listening to the shouts that were echoing down. While he couldn’t make them just out, James knew in his gut that it would be something he didn’t like.</p><p>James took a step, then another, forward. <em>I do not fancy Hermione Evans. I fancy Lily. </em> </p><p>
  <em>“And you know what <strong>really </strong>gets me? What <strong>really </strong>bothers me, Hermione? You go to Ravenclaw and then <strong>you fucking excel in everything you do!</strong> Like it’s easy or something without any hard work put into studying or practicing magic!”</em>
</p><p>His mouth turned down, involuntarily, against the thickness in Lily’s voice. <em>I do not fancy Hermione Evans. I fancy Lily. </em></p><p>“What’s going on?” he asked to the nearest person he could find, a third year who glanced up at him with wide eyes.</p><p>“Some Ravenclaw came to the Common Room, asking for Evans, and now Evans is shouting at her,” said the third year girl in a timid voice.</p><p>“Some Ravenclaw?” murmured James, turning back to the girls’ steps. <em>Hermione?</em></p><p>Then, Lily’s voice tore viciously through the suddenly silent Common Room as even those pretending to ignore the argument found themselves frozen at the vitriol of the Muggleborn Gryffindor as her voice echoed down the stone passageways. There was something vibrating in the air -- a tense, anticipatory air among the Gryffindors blatantly eavesdropping -- and they were rewarded as Lily’s cruel tone reached a crescendo that cut through the thick sense of eagerness in the Common Room.</p><p>
  <em>“<strong>I DON’T CARE!</strong> I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU GET UP TO! I DON’T CARE THAT YOU WRITE TO TUNEY AND SHE ACTUALLY REPLIES AND CARES FOR YOU OR WANTS TO KNOW WHAT YOU GET UP TO! I DON’T CARE ANYMORE ABOUT YOU. I DON’T! I DON’T!”</em>
</p><p>James felt his mouth tighten and his hands clench into fists at his side. It was an instinctive response because he knew who Lily was speaking to -- and his heart thundered in his chest and it was like he was outside again, listening to Snape call Hermione a mudblood but this time she wasn’t there to stop him and then he was striding forward, toward the entrance, his hands shaking, his pulse racing --</p><p>
  <em>“Just go back to Ravenclaw and hang out with your loser friend Crouch. Because you’re weird and sociopathic and I can’t even stand to look at you.”</em>
</p><p><em>How could she? Even when she was at her angriest with me, she’s never said anything that horrible,</em> thought James. <em>And to her own </em>sister!</p><p>Belatedly, he realized that there were several silent students behind him. Glancing over his shoulder, he saw many were staring at him, at the passage, at the stairs; some of the Gryffindors had a gleam in their eyes, and no matter what James did during the day in the corridors of Hogwarts, and he could never be as cruel to subject Hermione to the taunts that were sure to come.</p><p>A wave of protectiveness rose in him and he barked, “Mind your own business!” in a sharp voice.</p><p>Immediately, students began to talk loudly and kept their heads pointedly in the opposite direction of the stairs; approving, James nodded once and turned back, just as he heard the soft steps of someone walking down the stone.</p><p>The girl who emerged was not the confident and coolly collected Ravenclaw that James knew; Hermione’s shoulders were hunched over and there was a glazed look to her light honey-coloured eyes.</p><p>“... Hermione,” he heard himself say, his voice trembling as he tried to control his emotions.</p><p>She sighed, glancing up and then away. “I guess you heard all that, huh, Potter?”</p><p>His jaw tensed again and shifted to the side as he grit down on the back of his teeth. His shoulders were tense and he was clenching and unclenching his fists at his side, trying to get feeling in them again.</p><p>“I--” he shook his head and closed his eyes, breathing deeply. All thoughts of going outside and to the Shack were gone from his mind -- instead, all he could focus on was Hermione’s bright brown eyes, the slight sheen in them, and the tremble in her lips when she spoke. When he opened them, they were fixed firmly on her. “I wanted to speak to you.”</p><p>“Sure, why not? How about we go up to your dorm room,” suggested Hermione, her shoulders falling further. “If Black is up there, I can have someone else yell at me, too. I can have a matching pair from Gryffindor. Maybe then, I can visit Hufflepuff. I’m sure I’ve done something to offend them, too.”</p><p>A stricken look passed over James’s face. <em>Oh, Hermione...</em></p><p>“Hermione,” he said, reaching out to touch her shoulder, but quickly withdrew his hand. “Walk with me?”</p><p>She glanced up again, her lips pursed. She looked around his face, like searching for an answer. Whatever she saw in his face -- which he tried to make earnest as possible -- satisfied her. She sighed. “Yeah. Okay.”</p><p>Silently, they exited the Common Room through the Fat Lady’s portrait; James’s hand ached and he wasn’t sure if it was from his tight clench or whether his hands itched to reach out and touch Hermione.</p><hr /><p>After her rather public “outing” when she stepped in between Sirius and Snape, Hermione elected to eat her dinner in the kitchens, with Barty at her side. Regulus bowed out.</p><p>(“Why?” Barty asked.</p><p>“Because I want to get a read on the Slytherin Common Room right now,” explained Regulus, his face strangely solemn. “Snape and Evans were known as best friends from day one at Hogwarts, despite being in different houses and different statuses.” He sent an apologetic look toward Hermione, who shrugged. “Him calling <em>you</em> a Mudblood like that, and then being linked to his best friend as her sister, will change how those in Slytherin view outside friendships.”</p><p>“And my obvious connection to Lily now might make things difficult for you,” sighed Hermione.</p><p>Regulus shrugged in reply, a rather un-Pureblood move. “Maybe. Everyone knew I was friends with you before--”</p><p>“Ah, yes, the pet Mudblood,” said Hermione with a fond if not dry twist to her lips.</p><p>“--but Snape is merely a Muggle-raised Halfblood whereas I am a Black,” finished Regulus, sending a glare at Hermione for interrupting. “I have more standing in Slytherin than he does. If everything Sirius has done over the years hasn’t caused me problems, I doubt this will.”</p><p>Barty sent Hermione a worried look as she narrowed her eyes at Regulus and said, cryptically, “We’ll see.”)</p><p>In the kitchens, surrounded by the warmth of several fires in stoves and ovens, as well as the ever-accommodating House Elves, Barty watched as Hermione stirred her spoon through her cold summer soup.</p><p>“What are you going to do?” he asked quietly, brows furrowed.</p><p> Hermione shrugged, eyes remaining down on the bowl.</p><p>“I know you said that you were going to give Black a fight, but surely you didn’t mean that?” continued Barty, his voice starting to strain. “I know you’re more than capable, Hermione -- especially now -- so that’s not why I’m worried.”</p><p>Hermione looked up now. “Worried? Whatever for?”</p><p>Barty stared at her. “Not even five months ago, that Gryffindor was proclaiming his love for you. You were starting to be friendly with him. Now you want to fight him?”</p><p>“Oh, he doesn’t actually want to fight me,” replied Hermione easily. “He just wants to release his anger and this is one of the few ways he knows how.”</p><p>“What are the others?”</p><p>The look Hermione sent Barty was obvious and dry, and the brown-haired teen blushed so hotly that his ear tips went scarlet.</p><p>“And,” the female Ravenclaw said pointedly, “I’m not offering myself up for that.” She shuddered. “Having him chase me around Hogwarts reciting Shakespeare was enough. I don’t <em>ever</em> want to be caught in his amorous gaze.”</p><p>Barty narrowed his eyes. “So -- then why do this?”</p><p>Hermione looked down again, and frowned. “I think --” she began quietly, “I think I need to do this for myself, too. Like…”</p><p><em>I need to learn to divorce myself from the Sirius of my past - or, the future - and the Sirius of the now. With my presence, he’s bound to change. Things won’t remain the same. He’s already a different person than the man I knew,</em> she finished in her head, grimacing and looking away. <em>But that doesn’t mean I’m going to let him get away with this shite.</em></p><p>Barty stared at her for a bit longer, mechanically chewing at his own meal. Finally, he swallowed and muttered, “If this is what you’re planning on doing, well, then -- fine.” He sighed. “But don’t think you’re doing it alone.”</p><p>The smile Hermione sent him made his chest tighten and warmth spread through his body. “I know you’ve got my back.”</p><p>“Any day,” replied Barty.</p><p>The two grinned at one another, and finished the rest of their meals in silence. Once done, after profusely thanking the House Elves, Hermione and Barty meandered the halls until they were on the same floor as the Fat Lady and the Gryffindor Common Room. Hermione unconsciously did it, but, the closer they walked to her old, familiar stomping grounds from another time, Hermione realized that she needed to speak with her sister. What she had witnessed boiled within, and it was in direct contradiction to much of what she knew the Lily Potter of her past (future?) to be like.</p><p>Their walk slowed to an amble, and then to the dragging of her feet until they both stopped before the fat woman in a pink dress. Barty glanced at Hermione quizzically. “Are you sure you want to do this?”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. “I don’t want to do this. I <em>need</em> to do this.”</p><p>With a sigh, Barty placed himself opposite the portrait, leaning against the wall and idly pulling a book from his school bag, neither of them having gone to their Common Room after the fight. “I’ll be here, then.”</p><p>Hermione nodded and turned back to the Fat Lady. She was sure she could use her magic to nudge the portrait open, but a laughing pair of Gryffindor fourth years tumbled out, their breathless gasps silenced quickly when they spotted the blue and bronze of her uniform.</p><p>“I’m looking for Lily Evans,” began Hermione carefully. “Can you please let my sister know Hermione is here?”</p><p>The two eyed her like some strange creature, but then shrugged.</p><p>“Go right in,” one said, and then the two tripped over the lip of the portrait and went on their way down the hall.</p><p>Hermione stared after them as the portrait remained on its hinges.</p><p>“Well,” urged Barty. “You heard them. Go in.”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and stepped into the brightly lit room. The large fireplace that she used to sit in front of was inviting and warm; the arm chairs and low-slung scarlet loveseat in front of it was occupied by several students, one who had their feet up on the coffee table, an arm slung around his girlfriend.</p><p>Her gaze was next drawn to the opposite by the tall, skinny window, heavy velvet curtains drawn back. A chair and small, round table were unoccupied, but in her mind’s eye, she could visualize a younger her, with bushy brown hair and slightly buck-toothed, frantically combing through a heavy text for answers for her latest assignment, unaware of everything around her.</p><p>Fondness crept through her and Hermione forcibly banished such a feeling as soon as she recognized it. <em>I’m no longer a Gryffindor. That past of mine is barred from me,</em> she thought viciously, and turned to the girl’s staircase.</p><p>She received a few curious glances - her blue and bronze uniform striking among the red of the Gryffindor Common Room, but no one stopped her as she began to ascend -- mainly because she could hear the whispers that they thought they kept from her:</p><p>
  <em>“That’s her - the girl who stood up to the Marauders!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Evans’ sister, I heard--”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“--she must be really smart, as a Ravenclaw--”</em>
</p><p>She climbed up the four floors and knocked on the fifth year girls’ dormitory door, which was shut. After a moment, it swung open. The lithe, black-haired girl in a rumpled uniform who answered quickly shifted her annoyed expression into wariness, as she looked Hermione up and down.</p><p>“Oh.” She glanced over her shoulder and pushed the door open wider. “Lily -- it’s your sister.”</p><p>Hermione tentatively stepped into a room she knew well, looking around. It was the first time in this decade that she entered the Gryffindor Common Room, and the girl’s dorm by extension. She had never visited Lily in the past, and her sister never visited her in Ravenclaw. It was an odd feeling, seeing familiar four-poster beds, the silky red hangings, but not seeing Lavender’s <em>Weird Sisters</em> poster, or Parvati spreading out her exercise mat for her morning salutations.</p><p>“Thanks,” she said, leaving the door open.</p><p>She didn’t press her advantage further into the room, feeling -- for the first time <em>ever</em> -- like she was a stranger in this time. Before, she had distanced herself out of mental self-preservation and forced apathy. Now, having tried and beginning to make an effort with people in this time, integrating, she never felt more like an interloper in a sacred space.</p><p>Lily jackknifed up from where she was lying on her bed, staring wide-eyed at her sister in the doorway. She too remained in her school uniform, a rumpled white Oxford and unknotted tie. Her red hair was dishevelled and her eyes red-rimmed from crying. “Hermione? What are you doing here?”</p><p>Frowning, Hermione cut her eyes at the other girls in the room, all of whom were shamelessly watching. “I wanted to let you know what happened after you left.”</p><p>“We already told her,” said the black-haired girl who let her in, her voice dry. She crossed her arms and took up an aggressive hip-cocked stance against her bed. Her blue eyes were cool as they watched her.</p><p><em>Marlene,</em> Hermione’s brain supplied. Her eyes shifted to the curvy witch on the bed opposite to Lily, who had a brush in her hand and was working through a curl in her hair. <em>Mary MacDonald</em>, Hermione continued, and looked for the last girl who sat next to Lily on her bed, Phoebe.</p><p>“I see,” said Hermione lowly.</p><p>Lily’s face pinched. “Did you go to dinner?”</p><p>Hermione shook her head. “I ducked out with Barty. I didn’t see the point.” <em>And I didn’t want to be stared at</em>.</p><p>Lily nodded. “I guess that’s why you didn’t know that I knew -- the girls already told me. Phoebe had stayed behind as she was talking to Alice. Oh - you don’t know her--”</p><p><em>Sure I do,</em> thought Hermione, although the thought didn’t appear on her face. Instead, it smoothed a bit more, mimicking Regulus’s Pureblood look. <em>She’s Neville’s mother.</em></p><p>“--but she’s a sixth year,” finished Lily. The redhead sighed, scrubbing at her face. “Listen – ‘Mione -- I’m not really in the mood to talk, okay? Why don’t you go back to Ravenclaw and just read your books or whatever it is you do?”</p><p>The tired tone to Lily’s voice, as well as her bland delivery, had Hermione frowning. By the time she finished the sentence, Hermione felt a spark of anger rise in her.</p><p><em>Go read my books?</em> She scowled.</p><p>“I came here to check on you, given that you lost your so-called best friend today, but now I see that there’s something else we need to discuss,” she began, her voice tightening. “Like whether or not what Sirius said is true.”</p><p>Lily’s entire form stiffened. “I beg your pardon?” her voice was shrill as it rose.</p><p>Hermione nodded. “Oh, you heard me. Are you ashamed of me, Lily? Is that why you don’t tell people who I am? Go out of your way to never address me?”</p><p>Lily launched off the bed to stare at Hermione, paces away. Around her, the Gryffindor girls tensed; Mary slowly let her hand that was holding the brush fall to her bed.</p><p>“Ashamed?” Lily gave a tiny laugh, but it was mocking. “How can I be ashamed of you, Hermione? You said it yourself - it’s not like anyone knows who you are.”</p><p>“Oh, but you definitely have a problem with me right now,” said the other sister, keeping her voice cool. “And I think you have for awhile. Since your third year or so. So - what gives?”</p><p>“Nothing!” The denial was quick and sharp.</p><p>Hermione slowly nodded. “You know what, Lily? I don’t think you quite know yourself. I mean, you pretty much sold out your best friend because he called you a nasty slur--”</p><p>“He’s a racist! A bigot!” snapped Lily, two spots of red appearing on her cheeks. “He’s been hanging around the likes of Mulciber and Travers for <em>years</em> now and doing unspeakable things in the dungeons!”</p><p>“He was with those two when they cursed Mary,” inserted Marlene, jerking her head to the girl on the bed who froze as all eyes swung to her. “What was it, Mar? A strip tease that would’ve progressed a lot further if Flitwick hadn’t come around?” the teen’s cool eyes turned back to Hermione. “A variant of <em>Imperio</em>, I believe the Professors said.”</p><p>“And was Snape involved in it?” asked Hermione pointedly.</p><p>“He stood by,” argued Lily hotly.</p><p>“But it didn’t bother you at the time,” replied Hermione, eyes narrowed. “So it was okay then when he was an observer to your <em>friend and roommate</em> forced to give a strip tease -- but it’s not now. He was still hanging out with Mulciber and Travers when that happened, too. Oh! -- It was okay last year when Marlene called you a boyfriend-stealing ginger <em>cunt</em>, if I remember correctly, when Gideon Prewett asked you out, and you forgave her.”</p><p>Lily breathed heavily in through her nostrils. “That’s different.”</p><p>“You can’t have it one way and not the other, Lily,” said Hermione quietly. “Either Snape is bad news because he called you a racial slur just as Marlene called you a nasty word because the intentions behind it were both to hurt and harm you -- or it’s okay with your Gryffindor friends mess up and call you names but not the Slytherin.”</p><p>“There’s a difference to what <em>he</em> said to what <em>Marley </em>said!”</p><p>“Really?” Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “Also -- let’s point out that he wasn’t even speaking <em>to</em> you -- he was speaking to me.”</p><p>“Yeah, about that,” replied Lily hotly, “What gives? You never liked him so why are you suddenly so invested in me staying friends with him?”</p><p>“I find it hypocritical,” sighed Hermione. “I understand and recognize that being called the equivalent to a racial slur is not the same as being called a cunt, but the intent to harm is the same behind it. It was said because he felt threatened and hurt.”</p><p>Marlene shifted to glare at Hermione.</p><p>Lily began silently to seethe as she clenched her hands at her side. Hermione watched her warily as Lily’s green eyes narrowed, recognizing the signs from childhood that Lily was about to unleash her temper. Her voice began to rise as she spoke.</p><p>“Why is it okay that you get to have the friend in Slytherin and no one bothers you about it? It’s so unfair! Do you honestly think <em>Regulus Black</em> is your friend, Hermione? He’s a Pureblood and a Slytherin and a Black -- he and his kind look down on people like us! How can you stand there and talk about friendship and hypocrisy?”</p><p>“I know very well where I stand with Reg,” answered Hermione calmly, but there was a hint of steel in her tone. “Just like I know what people in Slytherin call me when they realize I’m around him. I don’t care about being called a mudblood, Lily. I never have.”</p><p><em>How can I?</em> thought Hermione, glancing down at the carpet and then her left arm, where Bellatrix once had Fenrir Greyback hold her down and carve the racial slur into her arm as a reminder of her position in magical society -- that she was nothing better than mud, nothing special. Hermione lived with the scar for over twenty years, and she had time to become numb to its meaning and to take it back as a badge of honour that she -- a nineteen-year-old Muggleborn girl from Crawley -- could scare the shit out of older and more dangerous witches and wizards.</p><p>Being called a mudblood was like calling the sky <em>blue </em>- it rolled off her back now. She had been called that and many other things -- and maybe it was just her mental age that gave her the apathetic slant to name-calling. She didn’t condone the use of the word, but she did think she was immune to its power over her.</p><p>“Oh, spare me,” groaned Lily, although it was sneeringly said. She rolled her eyes expressively, and her mouth was pulled down tight into a scowl. “Look at you -- Hermione Evans, so removed from everyone and everything that nothing bothers her!”</p><p>Hermione blinked. <em>What?</em></p><p>Lily caught the facial tick. “What? Like this is news to you? Hermione -- you don’t <em>care</em> about anyone or anything.”</p><p>“No--” Hermione found herself shaking her head in denial. “That’s not true--”</p><p>“<em>Yes it is</em>!” shouted Lily back. “Do you know why I don’t acknowledge you? Huh? Hasn’t the <em>clever</em> and <em>great</em> Hermione figured it out? I’ll tell you!” she stepped forward and thrust an accusing finger at Hermione’s chest. “<em>Because you don’t care about anyone or anything!</em>”</p><p>Hermione felt her breath catch in her chest and she aborted a step back in response. Her anger disappeared. <em>That’s not true. Not anymore</em>.</p><p>Lily however, was on a roll.</p><p>“God, I was so <em>excited</em> to introduce you to magic when you first came here! But you didn’t <em>care</em>, Hermione, you didn’t want to know any spells, you didn’t want to know <em>anything</em> about Hogwarts. You get this amazing opportunity, a letter like me inviting you to this exclusive school where there is <em>magic</em>!” Lily shook her head, her cheeks flushed red and her emerald eyes sparkling with unshed, frustrated tears. “But instead of wanting to know everything, or enjoying Diagon Alley, what do you do?”</p><p>“I--”</p><p>“You just get your books and then disappear. You don’t gawk or ask questions or seemed awed by this amazing thing!” Lily shouted, her flush growing from her cheeks down her neck and towards the neckline of her shirt. “But <em>I am</em>! Magic is this wonderful, gorgeous thing and there you are, all clinical and detached. How could you? <em>How dare you?</em>”</p><p>“That’s not fair, Lily--” Hermione sputtered, eyes wide.</p><p>But Lily did not stop, her chest heaving as she continued to spew her thoughts. “But I thought -- <em>hey, that’s my sister</em>. She’s always been a bit weird, never mind! She’s never been interested in anything, even at home with mum and daddy! Except when we get to Hogwarts, you don’t need my help. You don’t want my help.”</p><p><em>This is a strange echo of Petunia</em>, thought Hermione wildly, her eyes wide and her mouth open as she watched her relationship with her sister implode in the Gryffindor dorm.</p><p>“And you know what <em>really</em> gets me? What <em>really</em> bothers me, Hermione? You go to Ravenclaw and then <em>you fucking excel in everything you do!</em> Like it’s easy or something without any hard work put into studying or practicing magic!”</p><p><em>Because it </em>is, thought Hermione furiously, her anger roaring back as Lily continued to talk. <em>Because I have thirty years’ experience on everyone here! How dare you belittle my accomplishments because you have to work harder than you thought. </em></p><p>“I struggle and study and work my arse off to do well in my classes, because I fucking love magic! I love it! I love this world!” tears began to spill down Lily’s cheeks, but she didn’t notice. Hermione stared, transfixed.</p><p>“But you --” Lily shook her head. “Jesus, Hermione, you don’t give a shit about this world! You don’t care about grades or magic -- you just see it as something with purpose and what it can do for you. You don’t <em>deserve </em>the wonder it brings.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth turned down in a matching scowl. “You don’t know what I--”</p><p>“<em>I DON’T CARE!”</em></p><p>Hermione’s mouth snapped closed.</p><p>“I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU GET UP TO! I DON’T CARE THAT YOU WRITE TO TUNEY AND SHE ACTUALLY REPLIES AND CARES FOR YOU OR WANTS TO KNOW WHAT YOU GET UP TO!” she furiously stamped her foot on the floor, and her red hair crackled with magic, making Hermione eye her warily. She shifted her stance slightly in case she need to throw a <em>protego</em> up. “I DON’T CARE ANYMORE ABOUT YOU. I DON’T! I DON’T!”</p><p>Finally, Lily seemed to lose her steam, but she finished with an icy, “Just go back to Ravenclaw and hang out with your loser friend Crouch. Because you’re weird and sociopathic and I can’t even stand to look at you.”</p><p>
  <em>Well.</em>
</p><p>Hermione’s eyebrows shot up, and she used that to tilt her chin up in a stubborn, Hermione Granger move that she had never utilized in this time. Ron and Harry, and Neville, Seamus, Dean and Ginny, Fred, George, and even Parvati and Lavender would recognize the move for what it was: the stubborn, furious tilt of a righteously scorned Hermione Granger who was plotting her targeted enemy’s downfall -- usually Draco Malfoy or Pansy Parkinson or Marietta Edgecombe.</p><p>But here -- Lily didn’t know her. Didn’t want to get to know her. Her sister - <em>by blood</em> in this timeline - thought she was weird. A loser. Someone who didn’t see the beauty in magic. Who called her a sociopath for not feeling the things she felt.</p><p><em>(Not true!</em> a part of Hermione wailed in protest. <em>I feel things too! I feel hurt and anger and rage and love -- you’re my </em>sister<em> how could you--)</em></p><p> Hermione may not ever sympathize with Severus Snape for his racial slur in a moment of emotional compromise, but in that moment, she’d happily march up to him and tell him that her sister wasn’t worth the effort. With a cold band wrapping around her heart, locking it securely from the feeling of abandonment and betrayal, Hermione took a deep breath and exhaled.</p><p>“Very well,” she replied, coolly, eyeing Lily’s form as she panted in exertion from her catharsis. Her eyes swept over the other girls in the room, all frozen and wide-eyed at being front seat spectators to the sisters’ fight, and then turned on her heel, stomping down the stone steps to the Common Room.</p><p>As soon as she emerged, she wanted to groan, as all eyes swung to her and then immediately moved away. The Gryffindors in the Common Room began talking loudly and obviously about <em>homework</em> of all things, after OWLs and NEWTs were done!</p><p>Hermione could’ve smacked herself in the head for not remembering it sooner -- she had left the door open! They had all heard!</p><p>But there was one person who didn’t move away or talk -- rather, he stood transfixed at the bottom of the stairs, staring up with a rigid jaw and flashing hazel eyes as they moved from the darkened space to the weary Ravenclaw.</p><p>“... Hermione.”</p><p>She sighed. “I guess you heard all that, huh, Potter?”</p><p>His jaw tensed again and shifted, and Hermione imagined she could hear him grind his molars. His shoulders were tense and he was clenching and unclenching his fists at his side.</p><p>“I--” he shook his head and closed his eyes, breathing deeply. When he opened them, they were fixed firmly on her. “I wanted to speak to you.”</p><p>“Sure, why not? How about we go up to your dorm room,” suggested Hermione, her shoulders falling. “If Black is up there, I can have someone else yell at me, too. I can have a matching gender pair from Gryffindor. Maybe then, I can visit Hufflepuff. I’m sure I’ve done something to offend them, too.”</p><p>A stricken look passed over James’s face.</p><p>“Hermione,” he said, reaching out to touch her shoulder, but quickly withdrew his hand. “Walk with me?”</p><p>Hermione glanced up again, taking in his face. There was something fierce in it, with his square jaw, almost jutting out in his annoyance; his jaw was clenched and tight, and she could see his pulse thudding furiously along his neck. His eyes were wide, the hazel a brighter green than brown behind his glasses -- but they were pleading, aching to do something.</p><p>It was because of that, that she sighed and said, “Yeah. Okay.”</p><p>He didn’t extend his hand and she didn’t step forward to meet him, but they turned at the same time and moved toward the back of the Fat Lady’s portrait, ever aware of the silence behind them and Hermione’s realization that by tomorrow, the entire school will know what Lily thought of her.</p><p><em>I just hope that’s the biggest news piece for tomorrow, and not Severus Snape being mauled by a werewolf,</em> she thought morbidly.</p><p>However, once they were through the portrait, Hermione stopped dead, her eyes looking back and forth.</p><p>“Is something the matter?” asked James.</p><p>“Barty’s missing.”</p><p>Hermione stood, tense. She was still coming off the high from her argument with Lily, and her nerves were wrought with the idea of something happening to her truest friend in this time. Desperate to hide her trembling hands, she crossed her arms and hugged herself tightly as she glanced around the deserted hallway.</p><p>Her companion sighed, and muttered, “What I wouldn’t give for a map that shows where everyone was.”</p><p>The comment had Hermione’s lips twitch and she glanced at the tall, black-haired teen beside her. “You do realize you could make that, right?”</p><p>Startled, Potter turned wide hazel eyes on her. “What?”</p><p>“A map? That shows where everyone is?” elaborated Hermione. “Arithmancy. I mentioned the Poincaré theory before, I’m sure.”</p><p>“I--”</p><p>“Oh, you know what? Never mind. I need to find Barty,” Hermione broke in, her voice just shy of anxious. She felt the urge to pace. “If you’re interested in Poincaré, I’ll tell you some books to read, later.”</p><p>With that said, Hermione strode forward in one direction, aiming toward checking the Ravenclaw dormitory first, and then her practice classroom second. If both those spaces were empty, Hermione would be forced to search a wide spread of areas that Barty would rarely visit -- like her, he was a quiet creature that preferred a few locations that he felt comfortable in compared to a vast array of spaces. Many of the places where students could congregate at Hogwarts were meant for socializing, like the dorm common rooms, the Great Hall, or the grounds.</p><p>Despite her hurried steps, James kept up with her, nearly on her heels.</p><p><em>What could have taken him from waiting for me?</em> She wondered, chewing on her bottom lip as her thoughts whirred through her mind. <em>Barty keeps his promises. He wouldn’t have just left without a reason, and he knew I was inside. He knew I hadn’t left. So why…?</em></p><p>It wasn’t until they were down another hallway, with the dusky sun going down and casting long shadows that stretched and warped against the dark grey of the stone that James paused and cried, “There!”</p><p>Hermione whirled and raced to the teen’s side. He was leaning up against one of the thick mullioned windows that overlooked the Hogwarts grounds -- particularly, the forest. In the distance, behind the mountains, the sun dipped, turning the sky mottled shades of orange, indigo, and inky blue-black as the stars for that clear night began to appear. Above, the moon -- full -- was beginning to cast its light.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes roamed the ground, from Hagrid’s hut -- Barty wasn’t there and there was no smoke coming from the man’s home -- to the Lake -- he wasn’t there, either, casting stones toward the Giant Squid -- nor was Barty walking the various paths that led back to the school. He wasn’t by the gatehouse towards Hogsmeade, which left --</p><p>
  <em>NO.</em>
</p><p>The gut-wrenching, instinctive cry nearly burst from Hermione’s mouth and she clenched her hands against the cold stone of the windowsill, her shoulder brushing James’ as she leaned forward and nearly brushed her nose against the cold glass.</p><p>Barty, with his tall, lithe figure, was dogging the furious steps and pace of a lanky-black haired teen whose Hogwarts robe blended in with the growing darkness. If it weren’t for her familiarity with Barty, his straight brown hair, or his harried steps and gait, Hermione would not have been able to guess it was him from the distance.</p><p>“Shit,” muttered James at her side.</p><p>She glanced over and saw that his eyes were bouncing between the two figures and the full moon above them.</p><p>“Tell me your friends didn’t set Barty up in my place,” pled Hermione, turning fully to him, and reaching out to clutch at the sleeve nearest to her. James looked down at her in shock. “Tell me Black didn’t!”</p><p>“I wouldn’t!” protested James. “I would <em>never</em>! And as far as I know, neither did Sirius. I sent him after Snape to <em>stop</em> this from happening. I swear, Hermione, I have no idea why those two are together.”</p><p>Hermione stared at him. “But they’re going to the Shack.”</p><p>James’s eyes narrowed behind his glasses, but he wet his lips and stammered, “Oh? And?”</p><p>“Don’t play stupid. I know <em>you</em> know that Lupin is a werewolf,” replied Hermione.</p><p>James jerked back out of her grasp and she saw him twitch, an aborted move from going for his wand.</p><p>She instinctively reached for hers, her hand hovering outstretched for her wand to slip from its holster around her wrist and into her waiting palm. Hermione kept her eyes focused firmly on James while his bounced nervously between her face and the outstretched hand.</p><p>“Easy, Hermione -- I wasn’t going to curse you,” he said slowly, moving his hand away from his side pocket where he kept his wand.</p><p>Hermione waited a beat longer before letting her arm fall to her side; not that it wouldn’t take more than a flick for the wand to slide into her hand there, either. She relaxed her stance slightly. “Forgive me if I don’t believe you. You and your friends have a habit of cursing students in the hallways.”</p><p>The pained looked was back on James’s face. “Not you.”</p><p>Hermione made a noise of disagreement. She turned her back on the Gryffindor and began walking away. “Excuse me - I have a friend to rescue.”</p><p>“I’m going, too.”</p><p>Hermione whirled on the spot to stare incredulously at James. “What?”</p><p>“You’re not going alone,” he replied, jaw tense. His hazel eyes flashed with something -- conviction? Determination? -- but he strode past her before Hermione could get a good look. Hermione’s mouth had dropped open a bit, and she closed it with a firm click as she followed behind, their steps increasing in pace until they were running by the time they reached the Entrance Hall.</p><p>Despite the balmy spring day from earlier, the night was chilled and there was a faint sheen of dew on the grass as the two left the shelter of their school and headed towards the Whomping Willow at the edge of the grounds near the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>Their steps were faint, and as James -- ahead of Hermione by a few paces -- turned around the corner of Hagrid’s pumpkin patch (now barren), Hermione followed and felt herself skid and slip with the momentum of her turn.</p><p>She gasped loudly as one of her feet fell out from under her, dropping to her knee and skinning it, and her palms, as she braced herself and pushed back up to continue.</p><p>James, however, had heard her and stopped, turning in surprise. He reached for her, wrapping his hands around her upper arms and hauled her to her feet. His hands were warm on her. “Alright, Hermione?”</p><p>She nodded. “Thanks.”</p><p>“C’mon,” he muttered, letting go slowly and turning back to the way they were heading. “We don’t want to be -- late.”</p><p>Hermione pressed her mouth into a thin line. James did not have his wand out, letting the moonlight light their way across the grounds. Hermione followed suit, but she began subconsciously to reach for the magic in the air around her, like she had done earlier in the Room of Requirements and when she had shown Barty and Regulus her ability to manipulate magic.</p><p>Shortly, they arrived at a clearing out of sight from Hogwarts, just at the edge of where the Willow had been planted. Its limbs were still, the tree resting. That would change the moment they stepped close. Hermione remembered from her own adventures in her third year with Harry and Ron and the desperation that nipped at her when they had seen the Grim -- later revealed as Sirius -- drag Ron by the leg into the passage underneath the Willow.</p><p>Just as easily, she remembered the knot to push to get the Willow to stop flailing -- but without Crookshanks, how were they going to do it?</p><p>“Do you - do you think Barty is already in there?” she whispered through bloodless lips. <em>God, I hope he’s okay…</em></p><p>James’s own mouth thinned but the worry in his eyes betrayed the calm tone of his voice. “I’m sure he’s fine.”</p><p>Hermione stared at him.</p><p>Flushing under her gaze, James raced forward -- and then the Whomping Willow came alive. There were hints -- the slow creaks of the bark as the tree began to shift and sway -- and then the leaves rustled, there was a whistling noise as the limbs cut sharply through the air and the tree came alive.</p><p>James ducked under one thick branch, and hopped another. Hermione bit her lip and took a few aborted steps forward, but remained out of reach, her eyes locked on the Gryffindor teen, and his lean figure as he wove and ducked and even rolled in a forward somersault to avoid being hit. It was clear he had practice avoiding the branches.</p><p>Then, breathlessly, he pressed up against the thick trunk and began to flail, looking for the knot to freeze the tree. With a slam of his palm, he hit the knot and the Willow paused, its branches outstretched and a few close to whipping James away from its trunk. Hermione darted forward, changing her direction at the last moment when she remembered doing the same to Harry and both of them tumbling down into the passage underneath. She instead slammed into the trunk next to him.</p><p>“Blimey, Hermione!” gasped James, stretching a hand out and running it down her back. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Fine. Fine! We need to go!”</p><p>He nodded and then ducked down, sliding feet forward between a wide gap in the roots into the tunnel. There, he did withdraw his wand and lit it with a murmured “lumos,” just as Hermione slid in behind him. Her pupils went wide, adjusting to the lack of light except for the pinprick of James’s wand.</p><p>Both stood shock still, for a long, breathless moment as they listened to the creeks of the Willow coming alive above them. Hermione closed her eyes and strained for a bit more, ignoring the sound of her breathing.</p><p><em>Barty. Barty, where are you?</em> She thought, swallowing thickly. <em>Please, we can’t be too late, please.</em></p><p>Then she heard it, the creeks of floorboards and the soft voices of swears and reprimands, two harsh tones of young men in far over their heads with something that maybe only Snape vaguely understood in his own desire and punish Remus and the other Marauders.</p><p>“Let’s go,” she mouthed to James, who had his own head tilted in the direction of the noise. Hermione was reminded that it was likely he was already an animagus, given the nicknames he and his friends had brandied about; and that stags were able to recognize and hear sounds with a greater field than human ears could.</p><p>James nodded, ending the light from his wand and plunging them into darkness. Despite the pitch-black tunnel, Hermione could tell James had moved; but forward or back, she wasn’t sure as she was frozen, unable to extend her senses to make her <em>move</em>.</p><p>Then, a warm hand wrapped around hers. Tingles raced from her palm up her arm and her heartbeat reflected the sudden onset of nerves and anticipation. She felt a flush creep up her cheeks, and was thankful that James couldn’t tell. There was just something about being in the dark with him. Maybe it was his presence or confidence he wore, as he expertly led her down the tunnel with their feet sending tiny rocks and pebbles skittering away that captivated her.</p><p>Hermione didn’t remember how long the tunnel was; the last time she and Harry had been down, they were both nearly mindless with worry and fear about Ron. This time, even though she was worried about Barty, about what she was about to walk into (<em>a teenage werewolf - a bloody mess - a battle?</em>), she had experienced and her mental age, as well as several battles’ experience, to draw back on. She took a deep breath.</p><p>Then, her breath froze in her lungs as James pressed up to her, his front to hers as he leaned down and in close to her ear. Their bodies were touching from shoulders to stomachs to hips and thighs. Hermione’s heart, which had started to calm, racketed up to thundering levels.</p><p>“There’s a trapdoor coming up,” he breathed into her ear, hotly. Hermione blinked and repressed a shiver. “Your friend and Snape are there. We need to move quickly before they open it.”</p><p>“If they open it…?” Hermione let the question trail.</p><p>James’s voice was grim when he replied. “Then I’ll have Remus to fight off.”</p><p>Hermione nodded her head once, brushing against his chin and jaw. Taking that was a sign of agreement, James moved away, turning. His hand held in hers, but she knew that would end soon enough, so she slipped her wand into her hand.</p><p>They turned a corner, suddenly blinded by the light of both Barty and Snape’s wands. Barty was hanging just slightly back from Snape, an irate expression on his face as he scowled deeply and leaned against the rough tunnel wall. Snape, on the other hand, at a feverish expression on his face, his eyes alit with inner conviction as he slung spell after spell at the trapdoor that led into the ground floor of the Shrieking Shack. The iron lock remained latched, the wooden square not even shuddering as each colourful unlocking spell splashed harmlessly against it.</p><p>“Why won’t it open?” he muttered, just as James launched himself forward, slamming bodily into Snape, crushing him against the slope of the tunnel where it ended.</p><p>“Barty!” gasped Hermione, racing forward and launching herself at her friend, whose scowl and crossed arms (and wand) dropped to his sides as she collided with him. “Are you okay? What are you even <em>doing</em> here?”</p><p>“Hermione…?”</p><p>There was a scuffle and Snape sneering, “Get off me, Potter!”; they both turned to see James being shoved away, tripping over his feet. Hermione caught his arm and steadied him, the three of them facing Snape who was breathing heavily.</p><p>“Come to stop me, have you?” the Slytherin taunted, his chest rising and falling with each panted breath. “You can’t stop me! I’ll see what secret keeps Lupin here once a month! I’ll unmask him to the entire school! Then they’ll know what a monster he is, and what monsters you are for being in league with such a disgusting creature!”</p><p>“Leave Remus alone! He’s done nothing to do!” shot back James, brows furrowed.</p><p>Snape laughed darkly. “Yes, exactly. He’s done <em>nothing</em>!”</p><p>And before James could reply, the lock on the trapdoor above Snape’s head clicked.</p><p>Everyone froze, their eyes fixated on the lock.</p><p>Then, the wood shuddered, and something that sounded like claws or nails scraped across it.</p><p>“Snape,” said James, through trembling lips. “Move away. Slowly. Come here.”</p><p>Snape’s dark eyes were locked on the trembling trapdoor above his head, but he obeyed silently and began to take a few tentative steps in their direct.</p><p>A loud growl from above had him freeze.</p><p>“Snape! <em>Please</em>!” begged Hermione, reaching out with a hand. “We need to go!”</p><p>But something dark crossed over his face and he let his eyes drift from the trapdoor to Hermione’s face. His face twisted into something ugly as he spat, “I came all this way -- I won’t stop --”</p><p>The trapdoor shuddered once more. Above, something howled.</p><p>Then the door was pulled back, open.</p><p>There was no light in the Shrieking Shack, its windows boarded up and crisscrossed with planks, but even so, the four beneath in the tunnel could see the gleaming amber eyes and the flash of white from sharp teeth.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” muttered James, eyes wide behind his glasses. Hermione, who still held onto James’s side from when she caught him earlier, could feel his entire body spasm underneath her hands. “Move.” the word was said quietly, but then he shouted it in her face: “<em>MOVE</em>!”</p><p>The word broke through the air. Above, Remus in his werewolf form let out an ear-splitting howl and pressed his body through the small opening of the trapdoor, landing nearly on top of Snape who shrieked loudly.</p><p>Someone shouted her name -- Barty, likely -- but both Hermione and James were moving forward, James’ form rippling and the red of his uniform turning brown while Hermione swung her wand from the tunnel walls and ripped chunks of loose rock toward Remus, sending them into his side and knocking him off course and away from Snape.</p><p>Barty was there, reaching low and dragging a stunned Snape forward just as above them, a large stag, head low and antlers sharp, barrelled into the wolf. There was a loud snort from the stag and the wolf growled in response.</p><p>“Let’s go let’s go let’s go!” shouted Hermione, eyes wide as they caught Barty’s. They turned as one, with Barty shoving Snape ahead of him. The Slytherin was shaking, his already pale face entirely white as the three scrambled after one another back down the tunnel.</p><p>Bits of loose dirt and even some small stones fell from the ceiling around them as the walls shuddered, a few hitting Hermione on her shoulders as she ducked and brought her non-wand hand up to protect her head. Behind them, they could hear the sound of grunts, growls, snorts, and short barks, often timed to the shudders.</p><p>There was a yip, and then the sound of claws scrambling on stone.</p><p>Hermione met Barty’s eyes. The fear in his brown eyes had her turn, jutting her jaw and swinging her wand up as she nonverbally transfigured the loose rocks and hanging roots from plants above them into a stone and wood barrier. It wasn’t perfect, the transfiguration shoddy and quick, with irregular gaps between the squares and with some latticed pieces thicker than the others. But it would buy them some time.</p><p>Ahead, Snape disappeared beyond their sight. Barty’s expressive mouth twisted into a scowl. “Dick,” he muttered. He turned to Hermione. “Will that hold?”</p><p>“For now,” she replied, eyes wide as they began to back up just as a dark shadow moved. Hermione had no time to call out a warning as the shape crashed into her gate, sending shards of wood and rock everywhere. It broke the wolf’s momentum, though, and he tumbled headfirst into the floor, scraping the lower part of his jaw against the tunnel’s earthen ground. Dazed, the wolf swayed and stumbled as it tried to rise.</p><p>“RUN!” Barty shouted.</p><p>Hermione wasted no time, nearly skidding on her heel as they raced shoulder-to-shoulder down the narrow tunnel. Hermione could hear Remus’s wolf counterpart behind them, the wolf’s stench gaining on them.</p><p>Just as they spotted the wide, root entrance from the Willow, Barty let out a cry of surprise. Hermione turned -- just as Barty went flying into the side of the tunnel, his eyes and mouth wide and open as he stared down at his side. His hand fluttered above the four long gashes, cut through his jacket and sweater to his skin. Blood oozed out thickly.</p><p>“Hermione?” he weakly asked, eyes looking at her, just as something heavy slammed into her and sent her sprawling to the ground.</p><p>She bit back a scream as she rolled onto her back, staring up at the dripping snout of Moony. His mouth opened and she watched as his gleaming teeth descended.</p><p><em>No!</em> She cried in her mind, and reached for the ambient magic in the ground, soaked with Hogwart’s magic that leaked from the castle and permeated the very earth the castle stood on. It was weak, being far from its source, but enough that sparks of fire and electricity raced down Hermione’s hand and collated into her fist. She swung.</p><p>Moony’s wolf face twisted to the side and he whined painfully, the move forcing the majority of his mass off her. It was enough for her to pull back and stand, just as James in his Prongs animagus form, followed by a large black dog skidded to a stop near them. The stag glanced between Barty and herself, tossed his head, and then planted himself firmly between them and the wolf. In the meantime, the dog was nipping at the wolf’s legs, making him dance and whine as he was forced from his bloodied prey.</p><p>Hermione stumbled the few steps to Barty’s side and slung her arm around his back while pulling his non-injured side to hers. Still, he moaned and hissed.</p><p>“C’mon, Barty,” she whispered, her throat tight. “You can do this. A few steps, a short climb, and I promise everything will be okay.”</p><p>His glassy eyes focused on her shortly, before shutting, but he nodded. There was a sheen of sweat and his face was pale, a milky-white that Hermione didn’t like. Each step was painful and exceedingly slow in Hermione’s mind as they moved as one closer and closer to the entrance, until they were at the slope.</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. <em>How am I going to get him up? Levitate him?</em></p><p>Then Snape was there, reaching down through the hole.</p><p>“Here!” he shouted, stretching his hands and Hermione wondered at the relief she felt from someone she thought abandoned them. She shoved Barty forward, just as Snape grabbed his arms and hauled him up; Hermione pushed against Barty’s bum and legs, and the Ravenclaw teen groaned.</p><p>But he was out.</p><p>Hermione turned her head, watching as Padfoot and Prongs kept Moony busy, away from them. James must have sensed her look back, because the stag drew up to his full height, antlers scratching the top of the tunnel and bringing rocks down around him as he turned to look at her. His body blocked the entire tunnel from one side to the other, his form massive in the confined space.</p><p>She nodded once, and said, “Thank you,” before turning and scrambling up the slope.</p><p>Snape’s hands reached for her, and yanked; she resisted crying out against the sharp pull on her shoulders until she was face-down in the dewy grass, legs still dangling half in the hole behind her. Above, the Whomping Willow remained frozen, but only just.</p><p>“We need to go,” she muttered to Snape.</p><p>The Slytherin teen nodded frantically, once, twice; and together they hauled Barty up and between them, trying to matching their steps as they left the Whomping Willow’s clearing.</p><p>They made it only to the edge of the clearing.</p><p>“<em>What is the meaning of this?!”</em></p><p>At the furious voice, Hermione, who had been looking down and concentrating on counting her steps, glanced up.</p><p>At Barty’s other side, Snape froze and between them, Barty’s groan of pain merged into a moan of despair.</p><p>Just steps from them stood Albus Dumbledore, in a vibrant fuchsia robe with twinkling stars, his blue eyes furious, and his white beard stiff in his anger, the elder wand in his dominant hand nearly thrumming with magic.</p><p>Hermione closed her eyes. <em>Well, maybe the students of Hogwarts </em>will <em>get to hear about more than just my falling out with Lily tomorrow morning, after all.</em></p><hr /><p align="center">

  <strong>June 1976</strong>
</p><p>Everything came in blurs as they raced toward the Hospital Wing. Hermione smelled the damp, dewy air; there was a chill; the stone of the castle under her feet was hard and uneven; there were shouts and cries of alarm from the portraits as they ran past, Barty's still form bobbing in the air as Dumbledore controlled the spell.</p><p>At her side, Severus Snape stood pale.</p><p>Then, the Matron, Madam Pomfrey, was there, her wand in her hand, mouth already moving and running off diagnostic spells, one after another that they were almost one long string of Latin. Her face - tense, with prominent lines already carved in it - deepened further as she turned to Hermione and Snape and barked, "What happened to him?"</p><p>"I would like to know as well," said Dumbledore in a tightly controlled voice.</p><p>Hermione ignored that as she turned to Madam Pomfrey. "Can you help him?"</p><p>"If I knew what I attacked him!" the woman replied, in exasperation. "Why, it <em>looks</em> like a werewolf mauled him, but there aren't any wolves around Hogwarts!"</p><p>Hermione slowly moved her head to level a glare at Dumbledore, who did fidget for a moment. She then turned back and said, quietly, "It was a werewolf."</p><p>"Goodness!" The matron then glanced between her and Snape. "What about the two of you?"</p><p>"Barty first," replied Hermione, firmly.</p><p>Pomfrey nodded and led the still floating and unconscious form of Barty away, down the lines of empty beds until she reached the end. There, she drew the curtain and began her work. Hermione's eyes tracked her progress, and she locked them on the white curtain that separated her from her best friend.</p><p>At her side, Snape was clenching and unclenching his hands - a nervous gesture, she assumed; it wasn't long before Dumbledore turned away from looking at them in disappointment to go to Madam Pomfrey's quarters. Within minutes, both Professor Slughorn and Professor Flitwick were breathlessly arriving in the hospital wing.</p><p>Flitwick made his way directly to Hermione, wringing his hands and looking her up and down as he squeaked, "Oh, my dear, my dear! Are you hurt?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head, slowly, and found herself being steered to a nearby bed where she could still see the drawn curtain. Flitwick levitated himself up and sat next to her, taking one of her hands in his and patting it every so often. Behind her, Hermione could hear Slughorn speaking quietly to Snape, although the other teen refused to answer.</p><p>A pricking of her magic warned Hermione that someone was staring at her. She turned her head a bit and caught Dumbledore's mouth turned down in a deep frown under his white mustache. Hastily, Hermione turned her head away, throwing up whatever shields she had learned as a Ministry employee to combat against a Legilimency master's probe.</p><p>Dumbledore's frown deepened.</p><p>Snape's shaking slowly started to fade, until he was sitting on his bed next to Hermione, staring down at his hands, encrusted in dirt and blood. His long hair was dishevelled and - Hermione bit her lips to stop an inappropriate laugh - there was a twig stuck near the back. He was paler than normal, and his robes were torn, covered in dirt and grass stains.</p><p>Hermione knew she was a sight, too. Remus in his Moony form had nearly ripped her throat out; parts of her uniforms were covered in the greyish spots of dried werewolf saliva. She had scraped her hands and knees at two different points during the frantic run through the tunnels under the Shrieking Shack, and she knew she had Barty's blood, as well as hers, mixed on her clothing.</p><p>Eventually, the lights from the wall torches flickered and dulled as the sun began to peak, spilling across the stone floors in a gentle hue of golden honey. The gloom from the evening began to fade, but the gloomy atmosphere in the hospital wing remained, as Hermione wedged her hands between her knees and gripped her fingers tightly to stop them from wringing. Madame Pomfrey had yet to emerge from behind the curtain where Barty was, and Hermione's nerves were beginning to fray.</p><p>At some point, Dumbledore whispered quietly to Flitwick, and the two disappeared after asking Slughorn to keep watch, which the man did with a solemn nod.</p><p>When they reappeared, a sickly Remus hung between them, eyes darting back and forth in the hospital wing. Behind, followed James, Sirius, and Peter, each covered with gashes; James' glasses were broken and Peter had a nasty head wound, still bleeding while Sirius limped, hanging off of James. Behind them, McGonagall appeared, her lips pressed into a very tight, thin line.</p><p>Dumbledore's expression - one that was of firm disapproval when he had seen her, Barty, and Snape - was now unbridled fury. The very air was tense and thick with his magic as it vibrated, echoing his emotions. Hermione could feel her own magic wanting to respond, with Hogwarts at her fingertips ready to rise in response, but she pushed it down and back.</p><p><em>Hide, hide, hide</em>, she told herself, whispering to her magic and pushing it down, imagining a lid slamming shut and throwing away a lock.</p><p>Flitwick's eyes were shrewd as they darted between Remus - whom the staff knew was a werewolf - to that of Hermione and Snape, Barty behind the curtains, and then the other Marauders. Slughorn's mouth had dropped open, and his eyes were wide as he took in the four Gryffindors.</p><p>"I donnae where to begin," rumbled McGonagall, her voice rolling between a thick Scottish burr in her anger and the low growl of an angry cat.</p><p>Shamefaced, James helped Sirius sit down on the bed opposite Hermione, gingerly sitting with him while Peter took the one behind, furthest from the professors as he made himself small behind the broad shoulders of the two black-haired teens. Flitwick and Dumbledore gently placed Remus in the bed opposite of Snape, who blinked once and then tucked his chin against his chest as he looked down at his lap.</p><p>Slughorn, from Snape's side, placed a heavy hand on the teen's shoulder. Snape slowly turned to look up at him, a blank expression on his face as he did so. The professor began, "Now, Severus, m'boy-"</p><p>"HERMIONE? BARTY?"</p><p>The hospital wing doors banged open. Hermione's head jerked up as the doors banged off the wall as Regulus Black stormed in. His hair, shorter than Sirius', was in disarray, his tie was askew, and his shirt wrinkled. There were stress lines around his mouth as his wide grey eyes took in the sight of four professors and the six teenagers on various beds. Regulus' eyes lingered briefly on Sirius as they alit on his older brother, blinking in surprise.</p><p>"Reg-"</p><p>Then they skipped over him and went straight to Hermione, zeroing in on her and striding purposefully across the tile as he ignored the professors.</p><p>"Regulus-" broke in Slughorn, but stopped when the young Black heir shot him a glare that made the made snap his mouth shut so forcefully his jaw quivered.</p><p>"Mr. Black, <em>what</em> are you doing here?" asked an exasperated McGonagall as the teen walked past her, but huffing from the door had the others turn back.</p><p>James yelped in surprise, "<em>Lily</em>?"</p><p><em>Oh, wonderful,</em> thought Hermione sourly, mentally sighing and bringing her hands to her head to cradle it as she dug her fingers through her curls.</p><p>Hermione's redheaded sister was leaning against the doorframe, out of breath and emerald eyes wide as she took in those in the hospital wing.</p><p>"<em>Man</em>, you can - <em>huff </em>- run fast - <em>huff </em>- when you want - <em>huff</em>- Black," she gasped, slowly straightening. As she took in everyone in the room, their eyes locked on her, she gave a tiny, gasping, "Oh!"</p><p>"<em>Hermione</em>," the Slytherin said, eyes on hers as he came to a stop just a foot from her on the bed. He spoke forcefully, but Hermione could hear the tremble. "Where's Barty? Where is he? Is he well?"</p><p>Unbidden, Hermione's eyes darted to the taut curtain at the far end of the hospital wing, where Barty lay. Regulus' eyes followed and he slightly swayed. Hermione's hand shot out and she reached for Regulus'. He changed their grips so that he was tightly clutching at her hand.</p><p>Slowly, Lily edged into the hospital wing, moving toward Hermione as Dumbledore turned a frown on Regulus. "That is what <em>we</em> would like to know, Mr. Black." He turned back to Hermione, Snape, and then the four Marauders. "Who would like to start?"</p><p>"Start?" echoed Lily, her voice quiet as she slid into the spot between Hermione's bed and Snape's, her back to her ex-best friend. Snape's dark eyes trailed on Lily, fixated on her back as she blatantly ignored him. "Hermione, what happened last night? What's going on?"</p><p>Hermione's eyebrows shot up. <em>Lily </em>wanted to know what happened after she loudly proclaimed she didn't care what Hermione got up to? <em>The </em>nerve, thought Hermione, suddenly furious.</p><p>Instead, she stared at her sister, tightening her mouth into a tight line before she deliberately turned to Regulus. "I haven't been told anything since we got here about Barty."</p><p>Regulus's face pinched.</p><p>"Hermione?" Lily made a move to touch her sister's shoulder but aborted the move. "Are you hurt?"</p><p>The Ravenclaw glanced up and said, shortly, "No, not really."</p><p>"You're covered in dirt! And blood!" argued Regulus, his voice low. "Has no one even cast <em>scourgify</em> or <em>tergeo</em>?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head, squeezing Regulus' hand. She let her voice drop into a low murmur, "It's fine."</p><p>The other Black - the Slytherin one - scowled.</p><p>"Whose blood is this?" asked Lily, her own voice thin and reedy as she stared down at her little sister. "Hermione - if it's not yours-?"</p><p>"Some of it is mine," she confirmed, very aware that everyone else was listening. "Most of it is Barty's."</p><p>"Oh - Oh, God…" Lily's eyes widened. "Is there -" concerned warred with her annoyance at her sister, and Hermione watched as Lily tried to reign in her emotions from the previous night with the knowledge that her sister was hurt and her best friend even more so. "Is there anything I can do for you?"</p><p>"No, I'm fine," replied Hermione, her words clipped. She levelled a hard look at the Gryffindor. "Thanks."</p><p>Lily's mouth opened, but whatever she was going to say was abruptly stopped as Madam Pomfrey emerged from the drawn curtain around Barty's bed. Immediately, Hermione shot to her feet, nearly tripping in her haste but Regulus steadied her. Together, they turned and presented a united from with Professor Flitwick hastily skipping forward as well.</p><p>"How is he?"</p><p>"What happened to Barty?"</p><p>The two teenager's voices tumbled over each other as they spoke, their words mingling. Pomfrey glanced between the two, their pinched faces and furrowed, worried brows, and then turned to Dumbledore. "Headmaster, perhaps this conversation is best had among the professors?"</p><p>McGonagall nodded decisively. "Yes, of course. Come along, Miss Evans, Mr. Black; you'd both best get to breakfast, and then begin packing. The Express will leave tomorrow and I'm sure there are things you need to finish before then."</p><p>Lily immediately backed away, nodding at her Head of House. She mustered a wobbly, pained smile at Hermione, which faded quickly, and then left the hospital wing.</p><p>"Mr. Black?" the Scottish witch's burr thickened as the tones delved into a bit of anger of being disobeyed.</p><p>"I'm not leaving my friends," he replied stubbornly, not even turning his head toward her, staring hard at Pomfrey.</p><p>"Quite right, too!" chirped Flitwick, although there was a gravity to his face that Hermione rarely remembered seeing except for the night of the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.</p><p>With a Head's blessing, Pomfrey sighed; her face was paler and more worn than Hermione remembered from earlier in the evening when they first appeared, and the healer nodded wearily. She turned to the professors, many who clustered together near where Snape sat.</p><p>"Professor Slughorn, I will need you to replenish my potions stores," she began. "Particularly healing salve, blood replenishing, and essence of dittany."</p><p>Sirius swore under his breath, but in the quiet of the hospital wing, all heard it.</p><p>Slughorn's face was grave when he nodded. "As soon as possible, m'dear."</p><p>"How is Mr. Crouch doing, Madam Pomfrey?" asked Flitwick, his normally chipper voice - his excited squeaks and enthusiastic cadences - near flat. "What happened to him?"</p><p>James and Sirius leaned in toward Remus, who looked up, his face solemn and tense, like a prisoner waiting for the proclamation of his trial verdict. The fidgeting of his hands on the blanket of the bed was another indication of how nervous he was.</p><p>"Mr. Crouch was attacked by a werewolf," the healer said, carefully not looking at the Gryffindor teenagers.</p><p><em>So, you know,</em> thought Hermione, eyes narrowing. Just <em>how many</em> professors and employees at Hogwarts were aware of Dumbledore's decision to allow Remus to attend Hogwarts? She had nothing against the Gryffindor teen at all, but there were several glaring inconsistencies regarding safety when she had attended Hogwarts the first time around, and it wasn't pretty learning that Dumbledore was always so blasé or ignorant of safety measures towards his students in <em>any</em> time.</p><p>From his side of the room, Remus collapsed in on himself, burrowing his head in his hands. There was a pained moan from him, and all colour that Hermione could see between his fingers was that of a sickly green.</p><p>The Matron continued, "Mr. Crouch will make a full recovery, but the marks on his chest and hip will scar. Despite it being a full moon, he was <em>not</em> bitten and therefore is not a werewolf. He will, however, have lupine traits going forward."</p><p>"And what will that entitle?" asked Flitwick.</p><p>Hermione already knew; she had seen it in Bill Weasley after Greyback's attack. She closed her eyes as Madam Pomfrey's voice and explanation washed over her: "Enhanced senses, heightened emotions, a craving for things a bit more raw, meats-"</p><p>There was a gagging noise and Remus barely had time to shove Sirius away as he leaned over the bed and threw up.</p><p>"Mr. Lupin!" gasped McGonagall, waving her wand and vanishing the mess but not the smell. She did another wave and that disappeared, too. But the teen did not move, half bowed over the bed as he sucked in deep gasps of air.</p><p>Sirius pressed a hand on his back only for it to be violently shoved off. The Black took a startled step back, eyes wide.</p><p>Dumbledore's eyes cut toward the teenager, and then back at Snape and Hermione. His voice was flat when he asked without any inflection, sternly, "What. Happened."</p><p>When no one spoke, the air around them in the hospital wing thickened, like humidity before a summer storm would break, and his voice rumbled in low warning. "<em>Now</em>."</p><p>Hermione looked down, peeking from under her lashes at the Gryffindors opposite her as they too, looked around or down at the ground. Even Snape, who would normally be the first to point a finger at James Potter or Sirius Black, kept his mouth shut.</p><p>Eventually, James shifted, and Hermione knew he was about to speak, to take any and all blame for what happened the previous night. His mouth opened, but it was not his voice Hermione heard.</p><p>"It's my fault."</p><p>Regulus's head whipped around so fast that his entire body moved and Hermione stumbled forward in response as they both stared at Sirius, who stepped forward, a grim look on his face. He took a thick swallow, his Adam's apple bobbing in response. His eyes were determined, however, and Hermione felt the first stirrings of good feelings toward the teen for the first time since the lake-side confrontation.</p><p>James turned to look at Sirius for a breathless second. He turned back to the professors, and squared his shoulders. "No, it's mine."</p><p>Comically, McGonagall and Slughorn's head bounced back and forth between the two, while Flitwick narrowed his eyes thoughtfully. Hermione could not see Dumbledore's from her angle, half-blocked by Regulus, but she was sure they were twinkling when his pawns did something he appreciated.</p><p>"Mr. Black," began McGonagall, hesitantly, "Mr. Potter-"</p><p>"I helped," said the most unlikely of all people, and this time, Hermione's jaw dropped as Peter - the timid, shy teen who hid behind Sirius and James earlier, slid off his bed and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with them.</p><p>"No," said a weak voice, and Remus hauled himself off his bed from behind them, one hand on James's and Sirius's shoulders and he pressed between them. James turned his body to angle towards Remus, slipping an arm around his friends' broad shoulders to help him steady. "I'm a werewolf." There was a firm look of resigned resolution on his face, the facial slashes a stark white against his skin as he proclaimed his creature status. "It's my fault."</p><p>Hermione couldn't help but roll her eyes, and mutter, "It's hardly your fault because of your affliction, Lupin -"</p><p>"Oh, <em>of course</em>, you'd take their side!" sneered Snape, turning toward her.</p><p>"How dare you-!" began a furious Regulus, and then the seven of them were shouting over one another, accusations flying across the room.</p><p>"<em>-He didn't ask to be a werewolf!"</em></p><p>"<em>-Always taking each other's sides, I don't know why I'd expect any differently-"</em></p><p>"<em>Who was the fool who listened to Sirius Black?"</em></p><p>"<em>-Thought Ravenclaws were supposed to be smart-"</em></p><p>"<em>Don't project your own insecurities, Snape-"</em></p><p>"ENOUGH!"</p><p>The room went silent, and the teenagers sullenly turned to face Dumbledore, his voice cracking through theirs. "Mr. Lupin - how did this come about?"</p><p>Under their Headmasters' stern glare, and being singled out, Remus gulped and then straightened, his eyes closing briefly as he began: from the beginning of the year, Snape had hinted that he knew what Remus was, always dropping hints in the hallways whenever they'd cross paths.</p><p>Sirius broke in, "Please. He was threatening Remus! He'd call him a creature, a freak, a monster. Remus wouldn't hurt anyone-"</p><p>"Oh, but he <em>did</em>," sneered Snape, glaring hatefully across the room at Sirius, who snarled back.</p><p>"And whose fault was that?" the eldest Black shot. "Crouch wasn't even supposed to be there-"</p><p>"How is Mr. Crouch involved?" asked Flitwick, his frown deep as he interrupted the two. "And Miss Evans here?"</p><p>A few eyes turned to Hermione, who flushed and fidgeted, but Sirius took one look at her and miserably said, "It was me."</p><p>Hermione glanced up in surprise.</p><p>"It was me," repeated Sirius, glancing away from everyone. "I was… angry. I let my anger get the best of me, and I taunted Snape. I - I got an owl from home, and it…" He turned a very embarrassed red and scuffed the toe of his shoe on the floor. "I realize now how stupid I was-"</p><p>Snape snorted, and Sirius slammed his mouth shut.</p><p>James, pained, said quietly, "Sirius taunted Snape by the lake after our Defense OWL. It… got a bit heated, and Lily kind of…" he winced, glancing at Sirius before forging on, "made things worse. Hermione managed to get Sirius to stop, to turn and walk away when Snape called her a -" James stopped, glancing at Hermione. She looked back. "He called her," his voice dropped, "a <em>mudblood</em>."</p><p>McGonagall hissed, and Slughorn turned a disappointed stare on his charge, who squirmed slightly under the attention, two bright spots appearing on his cheeks.</p><p>Dumbledore, looking hard at Snape, turned back to James. "Please continue, Mr. Potter."</p><p>Swallowing, James nodded. "There was… some posturing and Sirius-"</p><p>"I told Snape and Hermione to come to the Shrieking Shack at midnight if they wanted to know the truth," finished a miserable Sirius.</p><p>"You <em>dinnae</em>," gasped McGonagall, turning a furious glare on Sirius.</p><p>Flitwick, near Regulus and Hermione, glanced up at his Ravenclaw and muttered, "oh dear, oh dear."</p><p>"We immediately went back to the dorms to tell Sirius off," James immediately rushed forward with the story, his voice rising earnestly. "He shouldn't have done it; we all knew it.<em> He</em> knew it."</p><p>Sirius nodded, and Remus glanced at his friend from the corner of his eyes as he said, quietly, "I told him to find Snape and apologize. We all did."</p><p>"Did you?" asked Dumbledore, peering over his half-moon spectacles at Sirius.</p><p>Peter nodded. "I went with him. We looked <em>everywhere</em> but couldn't find Sniv-uh, Snape at all. Then it got late so we decided to go to the-"</p><p>Sirius shot Peter a glare so fierce the teen squeaked and firmly clamped his mouth shut, realizing what he almost admitted to regarding their animagus abilities. Hermione watched as James put a hand on Remus's shoulder, the other one that had supported him stretching to touch Sirius, who slumped.</p><p>"We went to the Shack to cut Snape off," said Sirius, his voice monotone. "No one was there except Remus, so Pete and I thought to wait."</p><p>Slughorn, horrified, asked in a strangled voice, "You remained with Mr. Lupin while he transformed?"</p><p>Sirius shrugged. "He wouldn't hurt us-"</p><p>"A werewolf's nature is to harm any human-" interrupted Madam Pomfrey.</p><p>"Well, we weren't human," finished Sirius, jutting his chin out stubbornly.</p><p>There was a brief moment of silence then broken by Snape who rose to his feet and let out a triumphant, "<em>HA</em>! I knew it! I knew you had done something illegal! Unregistered animagi!"</p><p>However, whatever he was feeling was mitigated as Slughorn reared back in surprise and then surveyed the four Gryffindors with appraising eyes. "Unregistered animagi? At your ages? How impressive!"</p><p>"Horace!" chided McGonagall and Flitwick, both turning to glare at him.</p><p>The man shrugged, while Dumbledore sighed. "What happened then?"</p><p>Sirius and Peter looked at each other, with Peter reaching up to scratch his nose nervously. "The latch to the tunnel under the shack undid itself."</p><p><em>Likely story,</em> thought Hermione, remembering everything Snape had lobbied at the latch when they arrived. <em>Someone undid it.</em></p><p>But Sirius's confused expression made Hermione pause. She glanced at Regulus, who was staring at both Sirius and Peter, his eyes slightly narrowed in thought.</p><p>Peter continued, "Moony - er, Remus - was pretty bothered by what was under us, so we tried to stop him, but…"</p><p>"He got through," finished Sirius, glancing at those across the beds from him, lingering on Regulus and Hermione. "We transformed and followed him, only to see him going after Snape, Crouch, and Hermione."</p><p>The professors turned to Hermione and Snape, now.</p><p>"Yes, Miss Evans, Mr. Snape," began Dumbledore, but his voice wasn't nearly as angry as it had been earlier, "How did you come to be in the tunnel under the Shack?"</p><p>"That was me," began James, and he launched into his coming down from the dorm room, finding Hermione ready to leave the Gryffindor Common Room after speaking to Lily - Hermione had to give him points for not mentioning their fight, but she was sure the professors would learn about it shortly, with the way the gossip mill at Hogwarts ran - to them searching for Crouch and then finding him crossing the grounds with Snape.</p><p>By the time James came to the point where they arrived in the tunnel, telling Snape to back away, all Hermione could focus on was why Barty went with him. At what point did Snape come up to the Gryffindor common room, and how did he convince Barty to go with him? Her friend knew she was still in the room - and Barty disliked Snape - he disliked everyone that wasn't her or Regulus - and there would be no way he'd go anywhere with the Slytherin.</p><p>So <em>why</em>?</p><p>"-that's when I saw Moony break though Hermione's barrier - wood went everywhere and he tumbled right past them - and then slashed at Crouch. He turned on Hermione next, and Sirius and I caught his attention to give her time to get Crouch out," finished James, glancing at her although she was too distracted to realize that he avoided mentioning her punch the werewolf.</p><p>"Snape showed up," admitted a rather disgruntled Sirius, crossing his arms. "He helped pull Crouch out and then Hermione afterward."</p><p>The Headmaster sighed, looking every inch his hundred-plus age when he turned to the last silent student who was involved and had yet to contribute. Hermione felt the weight of his stare and glanced at him, but deftly avoided his eyes and any potential Legilimency attacks.</p><p>"I see," he said, quietly. "And Miss Evans? Is there anything you want to add?"</p><p>"Yeah," said Hermione slowly. She turned to Snape, and levelled him the most dead-eye stare she'd ever given anyone in her life and asked, "Why <em>the fuck </em>was Barty with you?"</p><p>"Miss Evans!" McGonagall's scandalized voice stopped Snape from any reply - although the Slytherin merely stared back at Hermione, his thin lips pressed into a tight line. He was breathing heavily through his nose and his dark eyes glittered in the mid-morning sun, but he did not move or attempt to answer her.</p><p>"I cannot begin to explain to you how dangerous last night was," began Dumbledore, levelling those involved with a steely look. "Young Mr. Crouch has suffered greatly and will carry the scars of last night for the rest of his life."</p><p>Remus looked sick again and seemed to wilt on himself, forcing James to haul him up.</p><p>"The six of you <em>will</em> be punished for your actions," the man continued, and McGonagall nodded at his side, looking every inch the stern deputy Headmistress that she was. Both Flitwick and Slughorn were equally grave, but both were curious, as it seemed that Dumbledore was making the decisions on his own without any Head of House input. Madam Pomfrey took the time to step away, out of the line of sight.</p><p>"Classes are over and as such, there is no point in assigning detentions," the man began, and McGonagall's agreeing nods stopped as she turned to stare at him. Peter smiled brightly. "<em>However</em>, we will revisit this idea after the summer when you return for your sixth and fifth years, respectively, as you will have time to reflect on your actions from last night."</p><p>Peter's smile dropped.</p><p>"Headmaster?" prompted McGonagall quietly as the man fell silent, looking at them in turn.</p><p>Hermione swallowed nervously, feeling her hands turn sweaty. <em>I spent so long staying out from your gaze, and now look where I am.</em></p><p>Regulus squeezed her hand in reassurance.</p><p>"Like Mr. Crouch, Mr. Lupin here is a victim of circumstance," began the Headmaster slowly. Remus looked up, shock and wonder crossing his face. "As he hardly went out looking for human flesh, I find it unfair to have Mr. Lupin's - <em>nature</em> - revealed."</p><p>"What!" burst out Snape, rising from his seat on the bed.</p><p>"Indeed, Mr. Snape," the man said, turning to him. There was a hardness to his eyes when he spoke next. "As Mr. Lupin is nearly done his education, and this was his only - lapse, so to speak - I think we can continue to allow him to attend Hogwarts while myself and the professors update some security issues for future full moons."</p><p>"He's a beast! An animal!" protested Snape, throwing a hand out at the Gryffindor, who quailed.</p><p>"Shut it, Snape!" shouted a furious Sirius.</p><p>Snape turned to Sirius and went to reply, but sparks erupted from Dumbledore's wand, and he sullenly turned back to the Headmaster.</p><p>"I will require an Unbreakable Vow, Mr. Snape," the man said, his voice quiet. "And from you as well, Miss Evans, Mr. Black - to keep Mr. Lupin's secret." Both Sirius and Regulus started, but Sirius quickly realized that the Headmaster wasn't looking at him.</p><p>At her side, Regulus stiffened. "Of course, Headmaster," he said in a rather stiff, formal tone that Hermione immediately could tell meant that he wasn't happy with the outcome.</p><p>"That's not necessary!" exclaimed James, making everyone turn to him in surprise. "Hermione's trustworthy! She already knew about Remus and his secret but hadn't told anyone."</p><p>"And Reg won't say anything," continued Sirius, a stare levelled - and met and replied to - at his brother. Regulus's face smoothed from expression.</p><p>"I will not take that chance," replied Dumbledore, glancing between the two Gryffindors and the Ravenclaw and Slytherin opposite them. "Now - Miss Evans? Would you care to go first?"</p><p>Hermione bit her lip and then sighed, stepping forward. "If I must."</p><p>Dumbledore's cold blue eyes bore into hers quickly before she darted them away. "You must," he replied, and then she stood opposite the man, her right wrist out as an unhappy Professor Flitwick served as their bonder. Hermione watched the yellow flames of the promise weigh on her wrist until it sank into her skin, her magic protesting the secret she was forced to keep on pain of death.</p><p>Regulus went next; Snape, last. Both Slytherins wore equally perturbed looks that disappeared as their Head of House - Slughorn - worked as their bonder. His disappointment was easy to read, but Hermione wasn't sure if he was disappointed at their lack of full agreement with Dumbledore, or for being put in the situation of a forced Unbreakable Vow, to begin with.</p><p>Hermione found herself back on the bed, idly rubbing the unmarked skin around her right wrist as she watched with unseeing eyes as Regulus and Snape took their vows; opposite her, McGonagall was thickly berating James, Sirius, and Peter, talking about issuing detentions regardless of it being the end of the year.</p><p>"We can sort that out when they return in the autumn, Minerva," broke in Dumbledore, a twinkle back in his eyes. "Now, there is something else-"</p><p>"Something <em>else</em>?" groaned Sirius.</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Black, something else," said Dumbledore, his mouth twitching under his mustache. "Why, the life debts many of you created last night."</p><p>Hermione's head sharply turned to Dumbledore. <em>You can't seriously begin to-</em></p><p>"Miss Evans and Mr. Potter went to the Shrieking Shack to save Mr. Crouch and Mr. Snape; there is a debt there," the headmaster explained with his twinkle on full as he glanced between a slack-jawed James, a narrow-eyed Hermione, and then a furious Snape. "Of course, then Miss Evans and Mr. Crouch saved Mr. Snape-"</p><p>"Wait," muttered Peter, "I'm confused. Who saved who and who has what debt now?"</p><p>"Whom," muttered Hermione, causing Regulus to tug sharply at their still connected hands in reprimand. She scowled briefly but then sighed.</p><p>"Ah yes," agreed Dumbledore, "It <em>is</em> tricky, is it not? Mr. Snape owes Miss Evans a life debt. I do believe there is a minor one owed to Mr. Potter from Mr. Snape as well."</p><p>Sirius wriggled his eyebrows as he nudged James in the side; but his best friend edged away with Remus, looking away from his best friend. Sirius's wriggling eyebrows stopped and his face fell.</p><p>"Of course, there is also another owed to Mr. Crouch by Mr. Snape," continued Dumbledore, smiling at the group, many who looked back at him blankly.</p><p>"What?" Snape looked near apocalyptic.</p><p>"Why," beamed Dumbledore, while Slughorn looked on with a twisted mouth, "Mr. Crouch also tried to help you, Mr. Snape - especially as you left him and Miss Evans. Of course, there is an equal debt that he owes <em>you</em> for helping him. Miss Evans would've had one toward you, but she did save you by using magic to protect you and Mr. Crouch from Mr. Lupin's werewolf form."</p><p>Then, his eyes turned to Hermione. Hastily, Hermione threw all her ill-willed thoughts about the Headmaster behind a barrier far thicker than what she conjured the other night, and then layered nonsensical memory after nonsensical memory to ensure the man didn't catch a stray thought.</p><p>"I hope you use your debt wisely, Miss Evans," the man said, "As not only does Mr. Snape owe you a debt, but so does Mr. Crouch. You undoubtedly saved his life last night - and having such a debt might come in hand at a later time."</p><p>Hermione fought to keep a scowl off her face, grinding her teeth instead. <em>Is he referencing Voldemort here?</em></p><p>The man turned his smile on the teenagers, and Hermione tuned out the man's speech of the power of friendship, working together, and putting aside differences. There was some variation, but it was eerily similar to the speech he gave in her fourth year when Cedric Diggory died.</p><p>"-and finally," he finished, making her nearly inaudibly sigh in relief, while Regulus sent her a tiny smirk from the corner of his mouth as he glanced quickly at her, "We have points to award!"</p><p>"Pardon me?" squeaked Flitwick, while Slughorn blinked in surprise.</p><p>"Albus, surely-" McGonagall tried to speak, but Dumbledore waved a genial hand and she fell silent, her mouth a small 'o' in shocked surprise.</p><p>"Yes, points," the man said, turning first to Peter. "To Mr. Pettigrew, I award ten points for being steadfast and true as a friend."</p><p>Peter preened while the other teenagers looked on in confusion.</p><p>"To Mr. Black, twenty-five points for recognizing his faults and attempting to make amends." The teen in question blinked in shock, and then a slow, confused but happy smile spread across his face as he looked around the room.</p><p>A hysterical laugh tried to bubble up in Hermione's throat. <em>Is he really doing this? Is this really happening? </em>she thought, eyes wide, as the Headmaster turned to James, who froze.</p><p>"Fifty points to Mr. Potter, for his display of bravery and courage in the face of danger-"</p><p>Hermione bit down hard on her lips and Regulus squeezed her hand tightly, his knuckles turning white - not in comfort this time, but anger.</p><p>"-and twenty-five to Miss Evans for inner-house cooperation," the Headmaster said, turning to smile at her, while Hermione stared back. "And <em>another</em> twenty-five to Ravenclaw for her bravery and courage in the face of danger." His smile was nearly beatific. "Miss Evans, you are a credit to your House, and had the Hat not put you in Ravenclaw, I'd imagine we'd be seeing you in Gryffindor instead!"</p><p>"Albus!" snapped Flitwick, his thick and bushy eyebrows down in a V.</p><p>"And, finally," the man said, and Hermione could see Snape straighten up, a hopefully glean to his eyes as he looked at the man despite the Headmaster not looking at him, "fifteen to Mr. Crouch of Ravenclaw, for inner house cooperation and doing what was right."</p><p>Hermione watched as Snape sagged, his exclusion obvious. <em>This wasn't right,</em> she thought, taking a deep breath. <em>No one should've been awarded points, and if we were, then Snape deserved some as well for coming back for Barty and me.</em></p><p>"C'mon," muttered Regulus, turning to Hermione. "If you don't need anything, we're being dismissed."</p><p>She had been lost in her thoughts; she hadn't seen Dumbledore leave, but he had, with McGonagall at heel, leaving her Gryffindor students behind to huddle together around Remus. The atmosphere in the hospital wing was odd in response, with there a heaviness to it that had not been there before the awarded points.</p><p>A solemn Slughorn clapped Snape on the shoulder and the teen looked at him balefully. "Let's go, Severus," the older potions master said, his voice very quiet, and very carefully modulated. Snape nodded.</p><p>Slughorn turned to Regulus, a question in his face, but Regulus shook his head. Hermione could read her friends' face easily: he wanted to stay with her and Barty. Slughorn read it too, and nodded; then, he and Snape were gone.</p><p>"Reggie-"</p><p>Regulus turned, spotting Sirius a few feet away, a cautious look on his face.</p><p>Sirius took a step forward. "Reggie - you have to believe me - I know my anger - but the points, it wasn't my idea -"</p><p>"Sirius," said Regulus through his teeth. He breathed in through his nose and exhaled noisily. "You're my brother, but right now I can't even <em>look</em> at you."</p><p>The eldest Black looked like he'd been badly hexed, reeling back with wide, pained eyes. He looked around, at Regulus, at Hermione, and even Flitwick for support, but found none. Instead, he gave his brother a tight smile and nod, and retreated to his friends, where James and Peter were speaking lowly to Remus.</p><p>"Miss Evans," said Flitwick, catching her attention and making her look down at him, "Perhaps it's best if you return to your dorm now?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "No. No, thank you, Professor - but I'm going to stay. I'm going to stay with Barty."</p><p>"Me too," agreed Regulus quietly, causing Flitwick to survey him.</p><p>The charms professor was quiet for a long, long moment, but then nodded, his eyes turning back to his Ravenclaw student. There was approval in his face, a softening to it that she hadn't seen all night since he appeared in the hospital wing.</p><p>He reached forward and patted Hermione on her hand, and squeaked, "Of course, dear."</p><p>Sighing, Hermione collapsed back onto the bed, untangling her hand from Regulus' as she did so. She felt so tired, absolutely exhausted from more than just her long twenty-four-hour wakefulness, but because of the emotional wringer she had just gone through.</p><p>"Hermione…"</p><p>Her head slowly rose. James opened his mouth, but then shut it, his hazel eyes running over her. He then sighed, running a hand through his hair, messing it up further as he looked away. "Never mind."</p><p>He turned and retreated the same way Sirius had, and with a few muttered words, Peter and Sirius were leaving with him. Alone, Remus looked small and pale, and when he felt Hermione's eyes on him, he glanced at her. His amber eyes - similar in colour to hers, how had she never noticed that? - widened in alarm, and he hurriedly twisted over onto his side, presenting his back to her and Regulus as he drew the bed sheet up and tight.</p><p>She sighed. <em>I think it's time I acquaint myself with Remus.</em> But as she and Regulus stood, walking over to the curtain that separated Barty from everyone else, she finished with: <em>tomorrow.</em></p><hr /><p>Hermione poked at her porridge the next day, alone at the Ravenclaw table for the first time in four years; without Barty at her side, she felt exposed, like there was a gaping, open wound at her side.</p><p>The knowledge of <em>why</em> she felt that way made her scowl into her bowl.</p><p>The entire school was running amuck with rumours of what happened the night before; everyone knew that Lily exploded on Hermione - the young, time travelling Ravenclaw's ability to be invisible was now blown out of the water, and she'd be incapable of hiding in her protective shell of invisibility. James' own part in the argument had been taken out of context, especially as many Gryffindors had seen him not only tell off the others in the common room but leave with Hermione; it began a slew of new rumours of an Evans' sister love triangle with Potter in the middle.</p><p>Hermione disliked that rumour; she knew that James and Lily were supposed to get married if Harry was to exist one day - and Hermione desperately needed her best friend in her life. But so much had already changed - had she threatened Harry's existence? What would her room-provided best friend say to her concerns now?</p><p>She could feel the sensation of numerous eyes on her being, the tiny hairs at the back of her neck tingling in warning.</p><p>"Hermione." Looking up, Regulus loomed over her, causing those around her to stop talking to stare unashamedly. "It's time to go. Are you ready?"</p><p>In response, Hermione put down her spoon and pushed her barely-eaten porridge away. She stood, joining her friend as they crossed the Great Hall, passing by the Hufflepuff table and then, lastly, the Gryffindor one.</p><p>Hermione kept her head forward but she was acutely aware of her sister's eyes on her as she passed. It was only when she was nearly at the door did she chance a glance back, and saw Lily's miserable expression at her plate morph into annoyance as Marlene whispered at her.</p><p>She sighed and followed Regulus to the hospital wing.</p><p>Inside, Remus was long gone, having escaped after a day spent in the room to his dormitory; currently, Barty was the only occupant.</p><p>He was also awake and sitting up.</p><p>"Barty!"</p><p>Hermione was barely conscious of moving; one second she was at the hospital wing doors, Regulus at her side, and the next she had her arms wrapped around Barty's wiry frame as he chuckled hoarsely and muttered, "ouch!"</p><p>She drew back and shakily whispered, "Sorry," surprised to learn that there were tears in her eyes and a wobble to her voice as she did so.</p><p>Alarmed, Barty glanced from her to Regulus, who stood beside her as she drew back, his hands shoved into his trouser pockets with a very somber face. "I - what happened?" Barty looked back and forth between them. His voice rose. "What happened? There was a -"</p><p>He stopped. His memory caught up to him and then his breath stuttered and he paled. His round eyes - already wide - went wider as he looked between his two friends, his breaths turning into gasps as he struggled to sit up, trying to get out of bed and <em>move</em>. "Merlin. <em>Oh, Merlin</em> - am I - I'm a - <em>I'm going to be sick</em>-"</p><p>"Calm down," soothed Regulus, leaning forward and putting a hand on either side of Barty's shoulders, pushing him back.</p><p>Barty gasped, struggling.</p><p>"Barty," Regulus said, firmer, as Hermione leaned forward and grabbed one of Barty's flailing hands. "Listen to me. You're not a werewolf."</p><p>Barty stilled immediately, staring at Regulus. "What?" he whispered.</p><p>Regulus lips pursed. "You're not a werewolf, Barty-"</p><p>"But," he stopped and looked down at his chest. His hospital wing robes had opened in his struggle, revealing his pale chest and the blood-tinged bandages wrapped around his middle. He looked back up in confusion. "But?"</p><p>Hermione and Regulus shared a look and Hermione gingerly sat on Barty's bed, by his hip. She laced their fingers together, tugging until Barty looked at her. "You're not a wolf but you <em>were</em> slashed by one the other night. You'll have some lupine traits from now on."</p><p>Barty remained silent for so long that Regulus and Hermione exchanged nervous glances. Finally, he took a deep, shuddering breath and whispered, through bloodless lips and wide, terrified eyes, "Do my parents know?"</p><p>Hermione bit her lip and looked away, while Regulus shook his head. "No. Dumbledore is keeping everything secret."</p><p>"But-?" the question on Barty's lips never formed, as realization dawned on him. He looked away, and Hermione resolved immediately that <em>she'd</em> never use Barty as leverage or a pawn, the way Dumbledore was potentially keeping him for. And by the gleam in Regulus' eyes, Hermione knew he felt the same way.</p><hr /><p>The Hogwarts Express was crowded as Hermione's fellow Hogwarts classmates shouted and called to one another up and down the corridors of the moving train. She had initially sequestered herself with Barty and Regulus, drawing down the curtain over the window in the door and slinging every privacy spell she knew.</p><p>There was a haunted look in Barty's eyes that she did not like, and bags under them as he came to terms with his new existence. His prejudice against werewolves - as a Pureblood - certainly didn't help, and he was bouncing between hating Remus, hating himself, and hating Dumbledore and Sirius for the situation he found himself in.</p><p>Hermione could only handle so much before she excused herself, citing need to change back into her Muggle street wear. She stalked the corridors, letting her frustration and anger of the situation and toward her sister - who was ignoring her - manifest in her angry gestures as she slammed the toilet door, and by the jerky movements of pulling her robe and uniform off as she wriggled into jeans.</p><p>Just as she opened the door, her uniform wrapped in her robes and bundled under her arm, she saw Snape stalk past, an ugly scowl on his face.</p><p>Without thought, Hermione followed until he was near the end of the train, by the baggage compartment.</p><p><em>He must have his own compartment,</em> she thought as the crowd thinned until he slid open the second last train door, revealing an empty and quiet corridor. Hermione took advantage and nimbly dodged forward, her wand already out, and grabbed the other teen's shoulder.</p><p>He squawked, his own hand plunging into his robes, but she was faster, spinning him around and slamming him hard against the wall, using wandless magic to slam the train door shut and locking it. In the same move, she thrust her wand tip up against his jugular, leaning up and forward into his face.</p><p>"Snape," she hissed, eyes narrowed.</p><p>His narrowed back in response. "Hermione-"</p><p>"<em>No</em>! No, you don't get to call me that. Not after what happened," she snapped, her voice low. His mouth snapped shut, and there was something unreadable to her in his dark eyes as he stared at her. "I don't know how or why Barty was with you, Snape, but if I find out you did anything - threaten him, manipulate him - to get him to go with you that night, my god, it'll be the last thing you ever do to another Ravenclaw, do you understand?"</p><p>He barred his teeth at her.</p><p>She pushed the wand into his neck further and he craned it away. "<em>Do. You. Understand?</em>"</p><p>Slowly, he nodded.</p><p>Hermione pulled away, slowly, easing down on her heels and then stepping back while keeping her wand trained on him. Snape brought one hand up to massage at his neck, his mouth twisted into an ugly form as he stared at her.</p><p>"We used to play together," he said.</p><p>Hermione frowned at the strange topic. "So?"</p><p>"We used to be friends," he continued.</p><p>She scoffed. "<em>We</em> were never friends, Snape. You had Lily and that was all you cared about - don't fool yourself."</p><p>His mouth turned down further. "And you don't need anyone, is that it?"</p><p>"If that's what you think," she replied, stepping back one more step and letting her wand slowly fall. "And I mean it - stay away from Barty. Stay away from me-"</p><p>"Not Regulus Black?"</p><p>The sneer in his voice made Hermione nearly roll her eyes. "Reg can take care of himself-"</p><p>"-Oh yes, he doesn't need some mudblood to help him-"</p><p>She laughed, something high and cruel as she moved to the train door, eyes on the boy who grew up with her and her sister in Cokeworth. She doubted she'd see much of him this summer. "Oh, Snape, you have no idea. You really have <em>no idea</em>."</p><p>Then she stepped through the door and was walking back to her compartment with her friends, her wand tucked away and her head. <em>I'm done,</em> she thought, almost feverishly. <em>I have spent so much time trying to maintain the timeline - trying to do what was right instead of easy. But things are changing now and I'm not going to be a pawn. Not this time around.</em></p><p>She was so lost in thought she nearly hexed the student who grabbed her arm and spun her around, her wand tip smoking and glowing.</p><p>James Potter threw his hands up and backed away until he hit the other wall of the corridor. "Blimey, Hermione! It's me! It's just me!"</p><p>She gingerly lowered the wand. "James."</p><p>"Hey," he replied, nervously shuffling as they looked at each other. The train rocked and Hermione let her body roll with the movement; behind James, scenery - green pastures - flew by. They were silent, eyeing each other nervously. So much had happened and she wasn't sure what to say to him - and, by the way he was shuffling, nervously fingering the sleeve of his sweater, he wasn't sure, either.</p><p>"I -" Hermione shook her head. "I think it might be best if you keep Black away from me for a bit-"</p><p>"Black?" he frowned and then sighed. "Sirius. Yeah - uh… yeah, might be best."</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair, making Hermione eye him as Lily's accusation ran through her head: <em>Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your broomstick…</em></p><p>"Have you uh… recovered?" he asked, quietly. Hermione looked at him in surprise, and he scratched at the back of his neck as he added, "You were bruised and had some cuts from the other night."</p><p><em>Oh,</em> she thought, and then nodded. "Yeah - it wasn't much. I'm fine."</p><p>James nodded. "I saw - I don't know what I saw - but I could've sworn you punched Moony in the jaw the other night-"</p><p>Hermione laughed weakly, a little nervous. "I think I did. It's amazing what the human body can do when you're full of adrenaline!"</p><p>The look James sent her from behind his glasses as a mix of fond amusement and skepticism, but he smiled at her and she felt her face respond in a similar, soft smile.</p><p>They were staring at each other, smiling, when his faded and he cleared his throat. "I'm sorry," he said quietly.</p><p>"About what?" Hermione was confused.</p><p>James gave a tiny laugh, looking everywhere but at her. "I'm not sure - the entire night, what happened; Sirius; I suppose, even you finding out about us being animagi - Moony -" his face dropped and he added, quietly, "Lily."</p><p>Then he paused, his eyes returning to her. His voice was tender when he asked, "Has she spoken to you since?"</p><p>Hermione stilled. "No. Not really."</p><p>"Will that be awkward at home?" James asked, his face screwing up.</p><p>"I'll manage," replied Hermione with a tiny shrug. "I'm used to being ignored there, too."</p><p>His hazel eyes widened from behind the glasses, and Hermione could see that he wanted to say something else. She quickly swallowed and plastered a smile on her face as she said, as brightly and dismissively as she could, "Have a good summer, Potter-"</p><p>"James."</p><p>She paused. "What?"</p><p>"My name," he said, in the same even tone he used. He was staring at her, something in his eyes that made her heart pound furiously against her chest. "It's James. I'd like it - I'd like it if you called me by my name."</p><p>"I-" she stopped and then tucked a piece of hair behind her ear, nervously. She licked her lips and said, "Okay," paused, and then added, "James."</p><p>He smiled, something beautiful and wide that stretched across his face. Hermione felt herself respond, the heat of a blush against her cheeks. He grinned down at her, rocking on his heels.</p><p>"I'll owl you this summer, yeah?" he said, turning it from a question into a firm decision that she could not stop. Instead, she just nodded, and he turned, glancing only once at her over his shoulder as he walked down the corridor, whistling as he did so.</p><p>She shook her head - <em>what just happened?</em> - and took a deep breath. She was going to need some happy to hold onto before returning to her compartment, and, the car ride from London to Cokeworth.</p><p>Hermione wasn't wrong; Lily didn't wait for her as she exited the train, heading straight for the barrier and passing through to their father, who was hastily folding and tucking his newspaper away when Hermione emerged, spotting him easily in their pre-arranged rendezvous spot. The following car ride was filled with a tense silence, with Leo Evans' eyes darting from Lily in the front passenger seat to Hermione in the back in confusion.</p><p>When they finally arrived home, Lily dragged her trunk across the threshold, dropping it at the base of the stairs. Petunia, who was coming down the stairs, stopped as Lily aggressively brushed by her and down the hallway, pushing the kitchen door open as she went straight to their mother.</p><p>Petunia turned to stare wide-eyed at Hermione as she pulled her trunk in with her father holding the other end.</p><p>"What was that about?" her eldest sister asked.</p><p>Hermione sighed as she and her father put her trunk down. "It's a long story."</p><p>"I'll say," muttered Leo, "I don't think I've ever seen the two of you like this."</p><p>Petunia's wide eyes turned between Hermione and her father, watching as he muttered something about a drink. He disappeared into the living room, and Petunia took the last two steps from the stairs. She then leaned forward and hugged Hermione.</p><p>In response, Hermione tensed, briefly, but then sank into the hug and wrapped her arms around her tall, willowy sister.</p><p>"I have time if you want to tell me," she muttered into Hermione's curls, drawing back to look down at her in concern. "But… if you want to avoid that, I'm seeing Sean later. Want to come along? He's been asking about you and your friend."</p><p>Hermione glanced back at the closed kitchen door, and then her father in the living room. She bit her lip and then turned back to Petunia. "Sure."</p><p>The smile on Petunia's face would've produced the brightest <em>lumps</em>.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>July 1976</strong>
</p><p>The summer passed quickly.</p><p>Lily continued to ignore Hermione, her face a mix between stubborn pride and wistfulness whenever Hermione caught her looking at her - but, the feelings of longing never remained long as Hermione waited for Lily to come to her and she never did.</p><p>Instead, to keep herself occupied, she spent time with Petunia and Sean. She got to know him better, and she thoroughly approved of him (inwardly thinking that anyone was better than Vernon Dursley). Even better, Petunia's plans for post-secondary were coming together the way she wanted, and Hermione was excited for her eldest sister.</p><p>Barty and Regulus corresponded with her regularly, and she visited Barty in London whenever she could, including the two full moons that summer, which were a test of her patience as his straw-coloured hair became shaggy, he finally grew a beard, and he sent her and Regulus on a four-hour-long journey for the best steak in London one night.</p><p>Moreover, on top of all that - James sent her weekly owls.</p><p>It was baffling, especially the first time the owl post arrived and Lily reached for it - a letter from Marlene and Mary mixed in - and saw James' scrawl. She had opened the letter, only to hastily hand it over to Hermione when she realized the salutation was for her and not the fellow Gryffindor.</p><p>Hermione, too, was baffled, but wrote back, saving each one and smoothing them out between pages in a journal. She brushed her fingers across them now, her eyes lingering on the last correspondence they had when James wrote, <em>looking forward to seeing you again next Friday night in our usual spot. Arithmancy won't be the same without your help -</em></p><p>And she smiled.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>September 1976</strong>
</p><p>James was nervous.</p><p>Not only was he not looking forward to his meeting with Professor McGonagall upon their return - as he and his friends were to meet with her after dinner for those threatened detentions from the Incident at the end of their fifth year - but because of a certain Ravenclaw.</p><p>He fought the urge to pace in the tiny cabin on the Hogwarts Express but ended up jiggling his leg up and down quickly. At his side, Sirius glanced over and then teased, "Merlin, why don't you just ask her out already?"</p><p>His best friend, who had permanently moved in with him that summer after being kicked out and disowned by the Black family, was privy to James's secrets, including his most recent crush. As a result, he blushed a furious red.</p><p>Remus, who was pressed against the window, felt his mouth drop open. "Prongs - you're blushing -"</p><p>"We <em>are</em> talking about Lily, right?" asked Peter, glancing around at the three other occupants. James' blush darkened in hue and Sirius's grin stretched. In shock, Peter felt <em>his</em> mouth drop open as he stuttered, "Wait! So, is Lily out of the picture then?"</p><p>James slouched in his seat, fidgeting a little. He ended up reaching into his pocket and gripping the snitch there, letting it out and zoom around the compartment as his eyes tracked it. <em>If he was focusing on that as he spoke, it wouldn't be as embarrassing</em>, he reasoned.</p><p>"After what she said, and how Hermione's handled everything…" he shrugged. "I guess… I want to get to know Hermione better before doing anything. I can't just go from one sister to another."</p><p>Sirius snorted. "I can."</p><p>The three other Marauders rolled their eyes.</p><p>Remus turned to James and gave him a patient smile. "Just keep seeing her in the library. I'm sure it'll lead to something more in time."</p><p>James grinned. "I like that idea. Thanks, Moony."</p><p>"I liked my idea better," pouted Sirius, slouching in his seat and crossing his arms as he watched James reach out and pluck the snitch from the air.</p><p>"Any idea of yours," began Remus dryly, "Is nothing but empty production. And besides, I think your ideas don't work too well on Miss Hermione Evans - or do you not remember what happened the last time you tried to get her attention?"</p><p>Sirius cringed. "It could've worked-"</p><p>Peter sniggered.</p><p>Friday came soon enough, after two days of classes including one Arithmancy class that was full of revision that James <em>completely </em>understood, thanks to Hermione's tutoring. He excited bounded from the Gryffindor common room, rushing past his friends (and Sirius who hooted after him), and past Lily, Marlene and Mary as they entered.</p><p>"No running in the halls, Potter!" he heard Lily shout after him, but he waved her off, dashing through the hallways and down a moving staircase as he made his way straight to the library. The place was nearly empty except for a few enterprising Ravenclaws who were already frantically scribbling on their parchments, taking notes from towering stacks of books from a variety of subjects.</p><p>James grinned at the sight and began to slow, throwing his shoulders back and running a hand through his hair as he turned down the zoology towards Hermione's secluded corner that she preferred to work in. (And a tiny part of him admitted he liked working there, too.)</p><p>A loud burst of feminine laughter broke through the silence in the library, and James felt his smile stretch further, his heart skipping a beat, knowing that Hermione was around the corner. With an extra bounce in his step, he turned, and-</p><p>His heart stopped beating for a moment and he froze.</p><p>Hermione was in her usual seat, facing the window with the bookshelves behind her. Her head was thrown back in laughter, her curls spilling down the back of the chair as she leaned back, her throat long and her hand reaching out to sprawl across her parchment and books on the table, ready for James.</p><p>But, opposite her in his usual seat, sprawled a tall, lanky-looking teenager in Gryffindor tie. He had foppish brown hair, longer than regulation but shorter than Sirius' rakish curls that framed his square face and dipped to cover his eyes. He wore glasses though, and the teen's hand reached up to push his hair off his forehead as he grinned down at Hermione.</p><p>He leaned forward and James must have made a noise because Hermione - and the other Gryffindor that he didn't recognize - turned to look at him.</p><p>"James!" greeted Hermione, breathlessly.</p><p>His gut churned and he took a tiny step forward, his hand clutching his bag strap tightly. He glanced between the two, his mouth tight as he gave a wobbly grin. "Hermione, hey-"</p><p>"Have you met Dirk?" she continued, glancing at the foppish hair Gryffindor, who gave her an easy grin in reply. He turned back to James and James could've <em>sworn</em> the other Gryffindor smirked at him. "He's in Gryffindor, like you!"</p><p>James would never be sure what he said in reply, other than he mumbled something and beat a hasty retreat from the table and library corner. It wasn't until he was several hallways down from the library and on a different floor, pressed up against a wall, that he took the time to <em>stop </em>and <em>think</em> - and wonder what the hell he was going to do now.</p><hr /><p>Hermione turned to Dirk Cresswell, confusion writ on her face. "Well, that was weird-"</p><p>"Not at all," replied Dirk, shrugging a little. "Anyway, I should go; you have a tutoring session now, right? I'll see you around, Hermione."</p><p>"Yeah," mumbled Hermione, twirling a quill and glancing thoughtfully where James had stood a minute earlier. "A tutoring session..."</p><hr /><p align="center">

  <strong>October 1976</strong>
</p><p>There was a lull of exactly twenty-two days before Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Slughorn struck. Hermione had been on tenterhooks since the beginning of her fifth year, along with Barty, whose newly lupine-like traits functioned much like a spidey-sense, leaving him with his nervous twitch more pronounced than usual.</p><p>On the other hand, from what Hermione observed with the Marauders, they all seemed to be sure that the professors had forgotten their threats to revisit their detentions when the school year resumed, or that Dumbledore's given points negated the ill will the professors had toward the Shrieking Shack incident.</p><p>For her, it was no surprise to receive the owl summoning her and Barty to Flitwick's office that Monday evening. Regulus, by virtue of not being involved and under an unbreakable vow, was exempt but wished them luck regardless. There was a grim visage on his face that made Hermione wonder what kind of punishment he was thinking <em>they</em> would be receiving (Hermione thought he was thinking of the past summer, when he admitted that his parents had done… <em>something… </em>to Sirius, causing the Potters to come and remove his elder brother from Grimmauld Place.).</p><p>"This will be fun," muttered Barty, grabbing one last dessert from the table, swiping the chocolate biscuit just as the magic from the kitchens cleared the tables. He began chewing on it as they walked away from the Ravenclaw table.</p><p>Hermione's stomach was heavy and low. She had spent <em>so much</em> time at Hogwarts avoiding attention, avoiding being seen. Having detention - everything that happened the past year - it made her uncomfortable. Professor Janulus and Professor Pythas didn't seem to care; even though she was done her NEWTs in Runes and Arithmancy, both had her attend their advanced seventh year classes where she was often used as a guinea pig or teaching assistant, or worse, an <em>example</em> for the Seventh years - many who did not appreciate seeing a tiny fifteen-year-old upstaging them.</p><p>Professor Flitwick, as her head of house, had a strange dubious position of being her advocate while also maintaining order. He could be kind, but also harsh; he was disciplined, but forgiving. As it was, he had mentioned something about her doing her Charms NEWT that year, but Hermione was sure that was being held over her for good behaviour. The old duelling master wasn't without manipulative tactics. And Hermione doubted he would be the kindly Head of House tonight.</p><p>Stopping by Flitwick's closed door, she knocked twice.</p><p>"Enter."</p><p>Barty and Hermione shared one last look, and then Hermione twisted the doorknob and stepped into the cluttered Ravenclaw Heads' office. Flitwick was at his desk, surrounded by numerous books (some open, others closed with feather bookmarks at various spots, sticking out from the pages), while two scrolls floated and a quill was diligently taking notes. It stopped as they entered.</p><p>"Professor," greeted Hermione carefully. Barty stood straight at her side, in an almost military bearing with his shoulders thrown back and his hands clasped behind him.</p><p>"Miss Evans, Mister Crouch," greeted Flitwick. His tone wasn't jovial or excited, but it wasn't disappointed, either. It was neutral. "Earlier than expected, good, good."</p><p>Hermione fought the urge to fidget. When she was younger, in her first life at Hogwarts, she would've fretted and wrung her hands in anxiety. She was no longer that naive girl.</p><p>"Is this about last year, sir?"</p><p>Flitwick eyed her and then flicked his eyes at Barty. The other teen kept his gaze far above Flitwick's head, focusing on the back wall of his office. Neither would apologise for what they had done - they had gone to save Barty and Snape, and Barty paid the price for it.</p><p>(At some point during the summer, Hermione had turned to Barty and asked, "Why were you with Snape that night?"</p><p>But Barty's mouth had tightly pressed down into a long, thin line and his eyes hardened, looking away from her.</p><p>Hermione had sighed. "Will you ever tell me?" she had asked.</p><p>"Maybe one day," he had replied, finally looking back at her, the hard look in his eyes melting away into fondness and something else. "But not today. Not… not now."</p><p>Hermione had not replied and allowed Barty his secrets. It wasn't like she was without them, either, and she wasn't going to be hypocritical in making him tell her when she refused to share hers.)</p><p>"In a way, yes," sighed Flitwick. He paused for a moment and then continued, "The other Heads and I disagreed with the Headmaster's decision last term. We have collectively come up with punishments based on your infractions after exams, and will be giving them out in Professor McGonagall's office shortly."</p><p>"We understand, sir," said Barty, although he mumbled the words out, barely moving his mouth.</p><p>Flitwick shot him a concerned glance, shaking his head sadly. "While I do not think points should've been awarded, detentions won't help either. I am sure you will both find your… punishment acceptable… although I was not supposed to tell you that ahead of the meeting."</p><p>Hermione blinked. "Why not, Professor?"</p><p>Flitwick's lips curled into a secretive smile. "Camaraderie, I believe, but I am certain that the others might have a few guesses as to what is coming tonight as well."</p><p>"I doubt that," muttered Barty, and Flitwick pretended not to hear.</p><p>"Shall we?" the tiny professor asked, and then the three were leaving his office and walking down two hallways and a set of stairs to McGonagall's office. Flitwick used his wand to tap on the door, which resulted in two loud knocks.</p><p>"Enter," the Scottish brogue resounded through the door.</p><p>Flitwick led Barty and Hermione into the room. At first glance, it was just McGonagall sitting at her desk at the front, but once she had a few moments to gain her bearings, Hermione saw the four Marauders, sitting in various desks and spaced throughout the room; Sirius and James were in opposite corners, as far away from one another as McGonagall could put them, and Remus and Peter were in between, somewhere in the middle of the classroom.</p><p>At McGonagall's pointed look, Barty and Hermione moved to sit at a desk. Hermione instinctively went to her normal seat, although that was unfortunately near Remus. Barty began to growl low in his throat, causing not just Hermione to look at him, but for Remus' head to pop up, his eyes wide.</p><p>"No, you're right, that's a bad seat," consoled Hermione with a low murmur. She abruptly changed the direction she was walking to move toward the back of the room, nearer to where James was sitting, watching both her and Barty curiously.</p><p>Barty settled, a morose look on his face when they sat.</p><p>"Sorry," he mumbled under his breath. "I didn't mean to-"</p><p>"It's fine," interrupted Hermione, smiling gently at her friend. "You can't control it all yet. That's okay."</p><p>However, Barty crossed his arms, hugging himself defensively, and slunk down in the seat until his chin touched his chest.</p><p>Remus, with his full lupine abilities, could hear the murmured conversation, and his face went milk-white in response. Something pained crossed his face, and then he slunk down in his seat, curling in on himself.</p><p>Hermione inaudibly sighed, and crossed her legs, impatiently tracing out a pattern on the desk as they waited for Slughorn and Snape. Those two arrived minutes later, Slughorn appearing as his usual jovial self, a wide smile on his face and in the middle of some story of some wizarding celebrity he knew as he spoke to a miserable looking Snape.</p><p>McGonagall pointed at a seat near Sirius, causing both teens to look murderous for a long, long minute, before Snape slunk over, a deep-set scowl on his face partially hidden behind his long black hair.</p><p>Flitwick and Slughorn moved to stand by McGonagall's desk, and she came around it to stand, arms crossed.</p><p>"Now that we're all here," began McGonagall, her brogue sharp as she surveyed the room, "We can begin."</p><p>"What are we doing here, Professor?" asked a mulish Sirius, arms folded on his desk as he leaned forward.</p><p>"We are <em>here</em>, Mr. Black," stressed McGonagall, "To discuss punishment for what happened at the end of last year."</p><p>"Professor! <em>No</em>-!"</p><p>"That not fair-"</p><p>"What! But Dumbledore gave us points-"</p><p>"<em>Headmaster</em> Dumbledore, Mr. Potter," interrupted McGonagall with a stern glare at the dissenting voices of James, Sirius, and Peter, "I remember. I was there. I disagreed."</p><p>That brought to an end any protests, with both James and Sirius snapping their mouths shut so hard and fast their teeth audibly clicked.</p><p>"As the Heads of your Houses, we collectively have decided on punishments that we think are fair and fitting for your activities and actions in June of this past year," she continued, her eyes sharply lingering on their faces one-by-one. Hermione refused to squirm under her old favourite professor's cool, assessing look; but Barty, like Remus and Peter, dropped their eyes while James, Sirius, and Snape glared.</p><p>"Miss Evans, Mr. Crouch, and Mr. Potter," boomed Slughorn. "Let's begin with you three."</p><p>Hermione laced her fingers together on top of her desk and sat straight, giving Slughorn her attention. One more year and she knew he'd be inviting her to Slug Club meetings, the way his singing praise in potions class was going. Even now, he had a slight smile on his face, so she knew that her punishment - and Barty and James' - wasn't going to be too harsh.</p><p>"Since the three of you were more reactive, attempting to stymie the situation from deteriorating further, we have agreed that your punishment will be the easiest." Slughorn glanced at Flitwick and McGonagall, who nodded. "For now until December, the three of you will host evening tutoring sessions in your best subject for first through fourth-year students. You will be assigned specific days, and you will do this in an unused classroom off the ground floor near the Great Hall."</p><p>Flitwick added: "Your grades are impressive across the board - with a few exceptions," he added, glancing apologetically at James, who shrugged, "-and as such, Ms. Evans, you will tutor in Charms, Arithmancy, and Runes; Mr. Crouch, Defense and Magical Creatures; and Mr. Potter, in Transfiguration and Potions."</p><p>"Your tutoring sessions will begin immediately," concluded McGonagall, flicking her wand and sending three parchments flying across the room toward them. Hermione caught hers deftly out of the air, as did James and Barty, and glanced through the text.</p><p><em>Charms - Mon &amp; Weds / Arithmancy - Tues, Sat / Runes - Thurs, Sat</em>, her parchment read. Inwardly, Hermione grimaced at the thought of her evenings gone, including Saturdays. James, however, had no filter and groaned, loudly.</p><p>"Saturday <em>too</em>, Professor? When am I supposed to schedule Quidditch practice?"</p><p>At that, McGonagall's pursed lips tightened even further into a pinched, white line. Her brogue was incredibly thick. "You shoulda thought of that before your actions, Mr. Potter."</p><p>Shamed, James slunk in his seat a bit.</p><p>"Mr. Pettigrew," began Flitwick, eyes peering at the startled teen, who squeaked a bit in fear and then squared his shoulders. "You will join Professor Hawthorne in marking his Defense assignments from now until December, whenever he asks it of you. Obviously, this will only be for the first through third-year assignments, but as you remember from your time, those essays can be numerous."</p><p>"And Mr. Lupin, you will be aiding Mr. Pettigrew with Professor Hawthorne's work," added McGonagall sternly.</p><p>Both teens nodded, Remus' cheeks and ears bright red.</p><p>"Mr. Black," began Slughorn, the friendly tone he had been using for the others melting away to something significantly cooler, "For your actions, and the lack of thought behind them, we have a detailed and thorough assignment that you must complete and present to us before the term is over."</p><p>Sirius's eyes went wide and he froze in his seat as three pairs of Professors turned their attention on him.</p><p>"You will research Wizengamot laws regarding werewolves through the years, from when they were first mentioned to the most recent activity," instructed Slughorn, his voice solemn. "Charting the laws passed and the conditions in which werewolves of Britain must live in, your task will be to immerse yourself with the knowledge of what <em>your</em> actions could have cost not just Mr. Lupin, but Mr. Snape as well. You will present this information to us, and we will determine if your content is sufficient or would require further analysis and detail in the winter term."</p><p>Sirius's face was pale and grave. The amount of sloughing through old material was daunting to a normal wizard - <em>unless one was Percy</em>, thought Hermione with a tiny mental smirk - but for Sirius to spend his free time doing that kind of research, well...</p><p>On one hand, Hermione could understand what the professors were doing: hit the teen over the head with the terrible conditions werewolves experienced in Britain and let Sirius know that his actions would have <em>terrible</em> consequences, with the possibility of Remus' death via execution. On the other hand, Hermione knew that the professors were hoping it would help Sirius later on in life as a Black, and the Black heir so that he could take his father's seat on the Wizengamot and make smarter decisions.</p><p>The task was as emotionally manipulative as it was educational, and to some degree, Hermione thought it reeked of Dumbledore's influence.</p><p>"Do you understand, Mr. Black?" asked McGonagall, tersely.</p><p>Sirius nodded, once, licking his lips nervously and muttering, "I do Professor. Thank you."</p><p>"Mr. Snape," finished Flitwick, "While I can admire the drive and wherewithal to uncover a good mystery as much as the next curious mind, your actions were meant to harm and expose Mr. Lupin purely for the wrong reasons. Do not think that we professors have not noticed your decisions and actions, recently, especially those amongst your new friends."</p><p>There was a warning look sent from Flitwick to Snape, whose dark eyes darted away, refusing to be shamed for his actions.</p><p>"As such," continued McGonagall, "You will be doing the same as Mr. Black: researching and then presenting to us before the term ends on lycanthropy and other prejudiced creatures in the wizarding world, specifically Britain. You will compile this information, analyse it, and conclude with reasonable solutions that are humane or could be feasible for the British populace to implement for those involved."</p><p>Snape stared ahead at the professors, a deadly glare on his face but he gave a sharp nod, refusing to argue back.</p><p><em>That was lucky,</em> thought Hermione, although she was sure Snape didn't think so. Knowing what she did of the man, the professors had just given him a head start in his improved Wolfsbane potion with Belby, and since they hadn't specified that he (nor Sirius) couldn't ask for outside help, Hermione was sure Slughorn would nudge Snape in Belby's direction. Again, a bit manipulative; a way to force Snape to do some good while keeping a skilled potioneer away from future Death Eaters.</p><p>Overall, Hermione kind of thought that she got a raw deal, losing her Saturday and most weekday evenings to tutor snotty younger years with mental capacities that might rival Ron's.</p><p>"Dismissed," ordered a sharp McGonagall, and without due, Hermione and Barty rose. They gave a respectful nod to their Head of House, who returned with a smile. As Hermione and Barty began walking up the steps toward the door at the back, they passed James.</p><p>Hermione went to open her mouth, to say goodbye, but the messy-haired Gryffindor's cheeks went red and he turned his head away, eyes forward and deliberately giving her the cold shoulder.</p><p>Blinking, Hermione almost staggered in shock, but Barty caught her arm and hauled her the last two steps, even if her feet dragged over them. Once they were out of the room, her best friend turned to her, leaning down and forward as he whispered, "Are you okay?"</p><p>"Um. Yeah." Hermione still couldn't wrap her head around the dismissal but began to firm her pounding heart against the irrational hurt it felt. "Yeah. It's… it's okay. Let's go."</p><p>"It'll be better tomorrow," advised Barty, lowly.</p><p>"Yeah. Tomorrow."</p><hr /><p>It was weird, being a subject of gossip.</p><p>Hermione never got used to it the first time around as Hermione Granger, and as Hermione Evans, she thought the gossip was actually more malicious in comparison. Previously, it was "oh, look at that Mudblood Granger with her perfect grades, toying with the famous Boy-Who-Lived, his heart, who does she think she is?" and now it was "oh, look at that Mudblood Evans with her perfect grades, toying with James Potter's heart, betraying her amazing older sister, who does she think she is?" with some others who switched the ending up to "betrayed by her older sister, who does Lily think she is?"</p><p>She had the misfortune to overhear one rumour about her, her sister, and James later that week (the same week as her tutoring punishment), as she was heading to the tutoring room. Three girls were standing nearby, their gazes on her as she walked by herself. Hermione couldn't see their house affiliation, and honestly - that didn't seem to matter anymore, either. The rumours were coming from all four houses; it wasn't like she made friends in Ravenclaw.</p><p>Hermione's blood was boiling, as they weren't even keeping their voices down as she neared. Her hands clenched, tiny sparks running up and down her fingers and inside her palm where heat built, a spell uncast...</p><p>"<em>-what a total bitch-"</em></p><p>"<em>-can't believe the two - ugh, </em>Mudbloods-<em>"</em></p><p>"<em>I don't even know what Potter sees in them, they're nothing special-"</em></p><p>"Nor do I know what anyone sees in <em>you</em>, Edgecombe, so why don't you piss off?"</p><p>The interruption of a male voice had all three girls start in surprise, open-mouthed and staring at the newcomer as he appeared from around the corner of the hallway ahead of Hermione.</p><p>Dirk had his hands in his pockets, his floppy hair covering one eye and hiding his glasses. He wore a pleasant expression on his face despite his words.</p><p>With a huff, Edgecombe - <em>and God, that was weird</em>, thought Hermione, seeing her daughter's scowl and thin face in the older teen - and the other girls walked off, throwing dirty looks behind them at Dirk. Once they were gone, the Gryffindor turned to Hermione.</p><p>"All okay, Evans?"</p><p>Hermione nodded, crossing her arms. "Fine. Didn't need a knight in shining armour though, Cresswell."</p><p>"Wasn't gonna be one, Evans," the other teen grinned in reply. "Thought Edgecombe could use a reminder to be nice to people."</p><p>"Well, she's not a Hufflepuff for a reason," retorted Hermione. She nodded at Dirk, uncrossing her arms. "See you around."</p><p>Dirk leaned against the hallway wall. "See you."</p><p>Hermione felt Dirk's eyes on her until she turned the corner he had come from, shaking off the weird interaction and entering the tutoring room McGonagall had assigned. Barty was already there, head down and writing furiously on parchment with some books around him. When there were no students, she and Barty collectively decided to use the time to get their own work done.</p><p>James on the other hand was leaning back in his chair, tossing his snitch into the air and catching it lazily. The wings were only half-heartedly fluttering, uninterested in fleeing from its owner. There was a pensive look to his face, and he didn't glance over when she walked in.</p><p><em>This is not the behaviour I was expecting after our letters this summer,</em> she thought with a frown, glancing over at him every few steps as she made her way to the long table she and Barty had claimed.</p><p>"You're later than I expected," the other Ravenclaw commented, his brown eyes glancing up at her as she pulled her chair out from the table, sitting with her back to James.</p><p>"I got held up," replied Hermione. "And it's not like I'm <em>late</em>. I'm early, by four minutes, in fact."</p><p>"Held up?" Barty focused on the important part. His eyes narrowed. "How?"</p><p>"Some girls in the hall were talking about me and Lily," sighed Hermione, beginning to pull out her tutoring books from her bag. Behind her, she heard two chair legs thump loudly as they settled to the floor.</p><p>Barty's eyes flicked over Hermione's shoulder and then returned to her, although she didn't see and was focused on lining her books, spare parchments, and quill and ink up for her own work. "What happened?"</p><p>"Nothing, really."</p><p>"<em>Hermione</em>."</p><p>The witch sighed and levelled a stare at her best friend. "They said some things. I won't repeat them. They were interrupted. They walked away. And then I came here."</p><p>"How were they interrupted?" the voice broke into the conversation and both Barty and Hermione looked up in surprise at James standing above them, a curious look on his face that was barely held back by his scowl.</p><p>"James," said Hermione, in surprise. She wasn't expecting him to speak with her after his cold shoulder.</p><p>"How were they interrupted?" he repeated, this time the curiosity bleeding away more to reveal his annoyance underneath.</p><p>Hermione blinked, glanced at Barty (who was watching the two carefully), and said, slowly, "Um - Cresswell showed up-"</p><p>A look of extreme dislike appeared on James' face for a moment before it disappeared. Hermione paused, staring up at him until he cleared his throat and muttered, "Continue."</p><p>"-and told them to piss off," finished Hermione slowly, still watching James. Her eyes tracked over him, from his tense shoulders to the frown on his face. "I told him I didn't need a knight in shining armour and then left."</p><p>James nodded firmly at that. "Good." Then, he relaxed and he ran a hand through his hair, nervously, glancing away. "Um, yeah, good."</p><p>Hermione widened her eyes and pressed her lips together to keep a smile in. "Good," she mimicked, watching as James' cheeks went pink.</p><p>He scratched at his cheek and then muttered something, beating a hasty retreat to his end of the tutoring room, just as a few students from Hufflepuff trickled in, looking around curiously.</p><p>"What was that about?" asked Hermione, turning to Barty.</p><p>Barty gave her a long look. Then he sniffed, replying, "If you don't know, I'm not going to tell you."</p><p>Hermione stared at Barty, her eyes on him long after two Hufflepuffs approached him for his tutoring help. Finally, she muttered, "Wanker," under her breath and turned to her Runes book and a new Gryffindor arrival for tutoring. She resolved to put Barty's cryptic words on hold - for now.</p><p>Hermione got an inkling of what was annoying James by mid-November when the Hogwarts staff announced a Hogsmeade day ahead of the end of the term.</p><p>In accordance with her "punishment," Hermione was in the tutoring room, near the end of the scheduled time. She, Barty and James were the only ones in the room; James was still avoiding her until he forgot and spoke to her (and then blushed and went quiet again). In between those moments, Hermione and Barty had created a complicated, ongoing paper game regarding Runes and writing jokes in various runic languages. Barty was currently in the midst of a dirty limerick, sugar quill in his mouth when the door to the tutoring room opened.</p><p>All three sighed in disappointment, hoping for a quiet evening.</p><p>"Evans, hi."</p><p>Hermione's head rose from watching Barty struggle with his phrasing to glance at the door. Dirk Cresswell stood in its frame, eyes locked on her.</p><p>"Cresswell."</p><p>James' head snapped around to stare at the other Gryffindor, and he tracked Cresswell's movements as he walked confidently into the room, glancing around.</p><p>"Nice digs," the younger Gryffindor whistled, a grin on his face.</p><p>"It'll do," replied Hermione evenly, watching him. "Did you need tutoring help?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Barty looked up and his eyes narrowed. "Then why are you here?" he asked, pointedly.</p><p>Hermione turned around, throwing her quill at him. "Rude!"</p><p>Being light and mostly feather, it made no mark on him. Barty instead levelled a disappointed glare on her.</p><p>"Ouch," he drawled sarcastically.</p><p>"Crouch's question still holds," called James from his end of the room.</p><p>When Hermione glanced over, she saw that James had reclined himself, stretching his arms out along one side of his table and had one leg crossed over the other, trying to take up as much room as possible. "This is meant to be a tutoring session. If you're not here for tutoring help, you shouldn't be here."</p><p>"Here, here," muttered Barty under his breath.</p><p><em>Seriously, what the fuck,</em> thought Hermione, her eyes glancing back and forth between the two before settling on Cresswell, who didn't look bothered at all by them.</p><p>"I'm here to speak to Evans," replied Cresswell, putting his hands in his trouser pockets and leaning against the doorframe, crossing one ankle over the other.</p><p>"Me?" asked Hermione, flabbergasted. She looked between Barty and James, both who wore scowls and were pointedly not looking at her. "Whatever for?"</p><p>Cresswell gave her an easy grin. "Can you step out for a moment to talk?"</p><p>Three voices answered at once:</p><p>"No, she <em>cannot</em>."</p><p>"We're not done yet!"</p><p>"Sure - just give me a mo'."</p><p>There was an awkward silence afterward as the three in the tutoring room looked at one other; Hermione attempting to figure out just which line Barty said and James had said, while the other teenagers had flushes on their cheeks but weren't taking anything back.</p><p>Slowly, Hermione slid her eyes from them to Cresswell, who looked greatly amused. "I'll be a minute, Barty." Her eyes went to James next and he flushed a deeper red when she addressed him. "James."</p><p>Then Hermione stood and left the tutoring room, keeping the door partially open. She was under no illusion that both Barty and James were probably pressed against the wall, eavesdropping, but she also didn't want to risk them breaking the door down if she had closed it.</p><p>Cresswell stood in the middle of the hallway, a small smile on his face. He jerked his chin toward the tutoring room. "Quite a set of guard dogs you have there."</p><p>"They're usually not this bad," scowled Hermione, glancing back and crossing her arms.</p><p>Cresswell made a noise of acknowledgment.</p><p>Hermione sighed. "So, what did you want to talk to me about?"</p><p>"There's a Hogsmeade weekend coming up," said Cresswell. "Two Saturdays from now. Wanna go with?"</p><p>Hermione thought of her Yule shopping and what she could get done before the holidays to avoid Diagon Alley. "Sure, that would be good. I could get some shopping done. I could use a friendly set of eyes."</p><p>A noise from behind the door made her squint suspiciously in that direction for a moment, but Cresswell speaking had her turning her head to face him.</p><p>He coughed, shuffling his feet a little, and it was the first time she saw Dirk Cresswell uncomfortably nervous. "Erm, no - I was thinking - like a date?"</p><p>Hermione's brain stuttered to a halt. "What?"</p><p>There was a nervous grin on Cresswell's face as he glanced up from beneath his fringe, his glasses glinting in the hallway candlelight. "You're scary, you know? Absolutely brilliant, but scary. And well - I'd like to get to know you better, Hermione."</p><p>It was the first time he'd said her name, and not 'Evans.' And while Hermione could admit that James Potter made her heart flutter just so - especially after that New Years' kiss - his avoidance of her lately had soured something.</p><p>Maybe it was spite, or maybe it was the first time in <em>either</em> of her lives that Hermione had been asked to Hogsmeade, but she heard her voice answer before her brain had time to catch up. "Okay."</p><p>"Okay?" repeated Cresswell, hopefully.</p><p>Behind the door, there was a loud thump.</p><p>"Okay," replied Hermione, giving him a nod. "I'll meet you by the carriages at nine that morning?"</p><p>"Groovy," replied Cresswell with a wide smile.</p><p>He gave a tiny wave, walking backward down the hall for a few steps and nearly missed the wall at the ninety-degree angle, turning and running into a tapestry that he was caught in briefly. He struggled to escape and then with a sheepish grin and one last wave, disappeared.</p><p>Hermione watched all this with an amused, fond smile on her face. That smile slipped off her face when she walked back into the tutoring room and both Barty and James were in completely different seats than where she left them, <em>and</em> both were looking suspiciously busy, ignoring her eyes.</p><p>Barty caught her eyes first and his ears turned red.</p><p>"Do you have something to say, Barty?" asked Hermione, her tone light but there was a promise of pain in her glare.</p><p>He grimaced, eyes flickering at James for the briefest of moments before he pulled his sugar quill from his mouth with a wet pop and said, "No," very clearly.</p><p>"Good," replied Hermione.</p><p>James never looked up, and in all honesty, Hermione never expected him to.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>November 1976</strong>
</p><p>In retrospect, Hermione realized that there was a reason why she didn't go to Hogsmeade. She just didn't realize at first, and it set the tone for her date.</p><p>Cresswell met her where they agreed, at the carriages, with his hair windswept and in Muggle jeans and a jumper. He looked good, and Hermione could appreciate the Gryffindor from a very aesthetic perspective.</p><p>"Hermione," he said with a shy grin.</p><p>"Cresswell," she replied.</p><p>His brow furrowed. "How about you call me Dirk? That's my name."</p><p>Hermione found herself nodding. "Of course - sorry. It's… habit."</p><p>Dirk cocked his head to the side a bit, frowning, but said nothing as the two entered the carriage. The ride from the Hogwarts gates to Hogsmeade was quiet and terse, uncomfortable in ways that Hermione didn't know how to bridge. With Harry and Ron, they <em>knew</em> each other. The conversation was effortless as it was to sigh, "oh, <em>honestly</em>, Ronald!" or "Oh, <em>Harry</em>!" just as the conversation was effortless when she poked fun at Barty or bantered with Regulus.</p><p>Even with James, and Sirius, Hermione found herself falling into easy conversation; Sirius because she <em>knew</em> him, and James because he was so different from Harry that she wanted to figure out his ticks, cataloging those differences.</p><p>The first glimpse of Hogsmeade from the carriage window was that of a bright, winter Wonderland village, covered with a thick blanket of freshly fallen snow and charming, quaint signs that hung above doors and thick panelled glass that was hard to see through. The shops were the same, the witches and wizards in robes walking down the icy cobblestone streets were the same, and even the shrieking, laughing Hogwarts students were the same to Hermione's washed memories.</p><p>Except, she'd turn her head just so, and the picturesque village turned dull, slushy, and grey and she'd hear the echo of a caterwauling jinx, or the eerie green of the Dark Mark hanging above that she'd shiver and cross her arms tight against her chest.</p><p>"Cold?" asked Dirk, concern in his voice.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "No, I'm fine, thanks."</p><p>"Oh, okay."</p><p>The two stood for a few moments by the carriages and Hermione desperately tried not to look at either image the town presented her through her memories or the black, leathery-looking Thestral behind her.</p><p>"Should we…"</p><p>"Do you want to-?"</p><p>The two stared at each other for a moment before laughing. The smile on Hermione's face broke any stillness and awkwardness.</p><p>"Sorry," she said. "You first."</p><p>"I was going to say, want to go to Scrivenshaft's? And then maybe the Three Broomsticks for a warm Butterbeer?" asked Dirk.</p><p>Hermione nodded and the two began walking; Dirk led the way, talking excitedly about classes that they shared and asking questions about the advanced material Hermione was on in Charms, the only class left she could take a NEWT in outside of her year mates.</p><p>As they walked into the stationary store, Hermione felt the tension leave her frame. <em>This</em> was what was missing before; the easy conversation. She found herself amused, joining Dirk as they looked at the different colours of ink, the invisible ink, the ink that was sparkly or changed colours, and then at the fountains pens and fashionable quills of peacock or quail or parrot. The longer they spent together, the happier, the more relaxed Hermione became.</p><p><em>It was almost like being back with Harry and Ron</em>, she thought happily, as they left Shrivenshaft's, a few galleons lighter and Dirk with a few bottles of ink and Hermione with a new journal.</p><p>So it was completely unexpected when Dirk stopped her near the Three Broomsticks and kissed her.</p><p>Hermione was so startled she froze, her mouth slightly parted as Dirk pressed his warm lips to hers, his fringe tickling her forehead. He tasted like spearmint and his mouth was warm, but there was no passion, no spark-</p><p>Dirk drew back, his eyes fluttering a bit as he opened his eyes, a small frown on his face as he peered at Hermione, who blinked back at him.</p><p>"I-" he paused, closing his mouth before shaking his head a little. "That was-"</p><p>Hermione was equally struggling to find something to say. "Yeah, it was like-"</p><p>Dirk's mouth twitched a bit and he gave a self-deprecating laugh as he reached up to rub at the back of his neck. "I'm really sorry, Hermione, and don't take this the wrong way-"</p><p>"But?"</p><p>"But," he began, giving her a <em>look</em>, "that was like kissing my sister."</p><p>Hermione exhaled loudly. "Oh, thank God, I was going to say the same thing."</p><p>Dirk's eyes twinkled. "It was like kissing your sister? You'll have to tell me everything - was it like kissing Lily or that other one you have?"</p><p>"Ew," Hermione's nose wrinkled and she punched Dirk on the shoulder. "Gross."</p><p>He laughed and drew Hermione close, throwing his arm across her shoulders as they walked the few remaining steps to the Three Broomsticks' door. "Really? Tell me how <em>gross</em> over a Butterbeer, why don't you?"</p><p>"You Gryffindors are all the same," she muttered, but there was a small smile on her face.</p><p>Dirk wriggled his eyebrows. "I bet."</p><p>The two found a table in the busy pub, laughing as they sat after Dirk ordered their drinks and a shareable platter of chips. As they waited, his face did grow a bit solemn and he tentatively asked, "So, friends?"</p><p>Hermione reached forward and took one of his hands resting on the tabletop in hers. "Friends, Cresswell. You won't be able to get rid of me this easily now."</p><p>He grinned back, and then untangled his hand from hers and leaned back in his seat, just as Madam Rosmerta, a very pretty and young witch, came by with their drinks and a floating platter behind her.</p><p>The two enthusiastically thanked her, and Hermione went straight to the fry, enjoying the warmth and the salty taste. Dirk watched her in amusement, and then his eyes skipped over her shoulder.</p><p>"So," he began.</p><p>Hermione looked up. "So…?"</p><p>"As friends, can I ask you something?"</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Dirk's tone was pleasant, despite the words. "Can you explain to me why James Potter is currently looking like he wants to <em>Avada</em> me?"</p><p>Hermione choked on her fry.</p><p>"I mean," continued Dirk, with a tiny smirk on his face, "I know I'm good looking, and smart, and pretty popular, but I'm no Quidditch player and quite honestly, I would prefer to be out of the Marauder's circle of awareness, you know? It was bad enough that your mate, Crouch, still glowers at me when I come without four feet of you - but Potter? What'd I ever do to him?"</p><p>"I'm so sorry," groaned Hermione, bowing her head into her hands. "I'll - I'll talk to Barty, I promise."</p><p>"And Potter?" Dirk's tone was light with curiosity.</p><p>"I wish I could tell you," sighed Hermione, peeking at Dirk through her fingers. "But honestly, I don't know."</p><p>"Hmm," the Gryffindor replied, uselessly. "Well then," he said eventually, reaching for the warm snack, "tell me about Gardner - you said we need to know his theory for the Arithmancy OWL?"</p><p>Hermione gratefully took the out Dirk provided her and launched into a detailed analysis of the theory he was asking about, as well as the questions she remembered being on the exam, but a tiny part of her wondered: <em>just what was James Potter playing at?</em></p><hr /><p>The following Friday, one the last three before the winter break began, Hermione had the opportunity to ask. Barty had caught a bug around the last full moon, and a worried Flitwick had requested the Ravenclaw spend the night in the infirmary instead of their tutoring punishment in case there were any complications from his lycanthropy and the Pepper-Up batch he was given.</p><p>With the end of term nearing, Hermione and James were both swamped with people needing help or final essays proofread, keeping both occupied until well after their usual end time until the candles melted and the shadows lengthened in their tutoring room.</p><p>Once the last student left, Hermione stretched her arms up and felt her back pop and crack. She gave a tiny moan at the feeling and then slumped over her desk. With a sigh, she began packing up her ink and quills into her bag, listening to James do the same.</p><p>Then, he broke the silence. "Is your boyfriend not coming tonight?"</p><p>Hermione stilled and turned in her seat to stare at James. Once he realized he was the object of her stare, he flushed and looked down at his desk, hastily sending crumpled parchment into his bag in an effort to keep busy.</p><p>"If you mean Dirk," began Hermione, watching James visibly bristle at the other Gryffindor's name, "He's not my boyfriend."</p><p>Only then did James look up. "But you two kissed—"</p><p>"Were you spying on me?" Hermione rose from her seat, irate.</p><p>"Not deliberately—"</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?!"</p><p>"Well, I didn't plan on seeing you and Cresswell sucking face outside the Three Broomsticks when I went to order my lunch, now, did I?" retorted James hotly, standing from his seat as well.</p><p>Hermione's mouth dropped open and she gaped at the other teen for several moments before pulling herself together, wrapping herself in a facade of cool detachment. "If I were, it's none of your business."</p><p>James flushed, knowing that to be true.</p><p>Both remained silent and then James turned away, the shoving of his quills and inks in his bag a bit more violent and angry this time around.</p><p>Hermione watched him before asked, tentatively, "Why did you stop talking to me?"</p><p>James froze.</p><p>She continued, uncaring that a bit of hurt slipped through her voice, "After sending me all those letters this past summer?"</p><p>"I—"</p><p>James' Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed, glancing around the room but not at her, as if he sought the answer from the walls. "I just thought—"</p><p>"That what? It was better for you to keep your distance? You can't run hot and cold, Potter," argued Hermione, "Not when you said you wanted to be friends at the end of last year, talk about how we'd spend time together and then just – just – I dunno, <em>turn tail</em> like some coward—"</p><p>James sent a vicious scowl at Hermione, tossing his bag down on the table. "I'm not a coward!"</p><p>"Then why are you avoiding me?" she asked exasperatedly.</p><p>"I- I'm not—"</p><p>"You <em>are</em>."</p><p>They fell silent. There was something in Hermione's voice, or her face, that she couldn't see but that James could; his hazel eyes darted all over her face, never settling as he took in the raw hurt and the etched lines that her final line made.</p><p>He swallowed again, this time recognizing his actions hurt her. "I'm sorry," he said quietly. There was a phantom pain in his chest and made everything tight. "I didn't mean to."</p><p>"But you did."</p><p>"I know," he agreed quietly, looking down. "I don't have a proper excuse—"</p><p>"<em>Why did you then?</em>"</p><p>James turned and fisted his hands around the strap of his book bag. Could he even admit that it was the jealousy of seeing her spending time with Cresswell, in <em>their</em> spot in the library? That watching Cresswell pursue her made him wonder if he really fancied Hermione or if this was a rebound thing from Lily?</p><p>He wouldn't admit to it – not when he wasn't fully sure yet, either. But he didn't want to spend the rest of the school year without some kind of interaction with the younger witch.</p><p>"I'm sorry," he said again, looking up and catching her eyes.</p><p>Hermione bit her lower lip and chewed on it, watching him warily. "You'll stop avoiding me?"</p><p>James nodded, slowly. "Promise."</p><p>Her eyebrows rose skeptically, and he grinned, recognizing that maybe a promise was a bit futile. So, he added: "Marauder's honour. And <em>that's</em> a promise I won't break easily."</p><p>Something flashed in Hermione's eyes – acknowledgment? – and then she nodded. "Okay. Marauder's honour, then. No more avoiding me."</p><p>"No more avoiding you," he agreed easily, something tight in his chest loosening.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. "Do you still need Arithmancy help?"</p><p>"Oh, Merlin, yes," gasped James, practically throwing himself a few steps forward as he emphatically nodded. "I mean, all your tutoring last year has really helped this year, but I could use a refresher and it would be great if you could check things over—"</p><p>She laughed, then, the same head-toss that she made that day in the library when he walked in on her and Cresswell, but there was something brighter, more vibrant in this laugh.</p><p>"Okay," she chuckled, amber eyes glittering in the candlelight. "I know our Fridays are busy here, but... if you have Sunday free...?"</p><p>"Our spot? In the library?" eagerly asked James.</p><p>Hermione's lips curled into a content smile. "Yeah. Our spot."</p><hr /><p>And that Sunday, when Hermione looked up from her seat at her usual table, to see James walking toward her with his lopsided smile, Hermione finally thought that things were back on track, and nothing could ruin the rest of her year.</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC...</p>

  <strong>December 1976</strong>
</p><p>Diagon Alley was one of Hermione's favourite places in the Wizarding world. She didn't appreciate it much when she was younger, in her first life, due to the enormous attraction that Hogwarts' library held for her - <em>all that knowledge</em> - but as she grew, and embraced more of wizarding culture, she had come to appreciate Diagon's quaintness, its quirkiness. She appreciated the ambiance of the narrow, cobblestone paths with light, fluffy snow lining wooden shop signs or overhangs, with the Yule stock on display in the windows, and even the very Victorian feel of fur muffs and coats and carolers on the corner.</p><p>Both Barty and Regulus, when she met with them, wore traditional wizards' outer robes with fur lining the collar and sleeves; Regulus' were of better quality, in a dark, inky black that reflected the same blue tinge his dark hair had whereas Barty's were brown, tailored, and a bit more contemporary with their wide lapels and looser fit.</p><p>Hermione made a face. <em>Of all the fashion statements,</em> she thought, <em>the 70s could have been one of the most awkward decades. You're either Ian Drury or Sonny Bono.</em></p><p>She was beginning to dread the day her male friends began to grow more than wisps of facial hair.</p><p>"Hermione!" greeted Barty, frantically waving an arm high above his head from where he and Regulus stood next to Flourish &amp; Blotts. It was their usual designated meeting space, and the Alley was rather crowded with others doing their holiday shopping.</p><p>Hermione gave both Barty and Regulus quick kisses of greeting on their red cheeks. "Shall we?" she asked, eyes already skipping over to the front entrance of the bookstore.</p><p>"Flourish's last," both teens stated, making Hermione pout.</p><p>Their first business was Gringott's for Barty, leaving Regulus and Hermione to wait outside the bank. There, they compared shopping lists and discussing Barty's present.</p><p>"What are you going to get him?" asked Hermione, looking up at the youngest Black.</p><p>"Probably a book," he said, shrugging. "I think he was interested in some theoretical texts that aren't easily found in Britain - you know, Fillory; Mryddin; Greybeard -, so I was going to ask for my French relatives to find one of them for me in Paris." He paused. "Or maybe our Italian relatives to search a bit more afield."</p><p>Hermione stared. "Sometimes, the way you go out of your way to find things drives home how ridiculously wealthy you are."</p><p>Regulus held back a preen behind a tiny smile.</p><p>Barty exited the bank then, saving Hermione from admitting she didn't know what she was going to get her best friend to Regulus. The three quickly left the dour stares from the goblin guards that stood just outside the doors, moving from their line of sight and toward the nearest shop that caught their fancy.</p><p>Later, Hermione had bought an acromantula silk scarf from her grandmother; a smoking pipe for her grandfather; a card set for her uncle; a self-inking fountain pen for her father; and even a new recipe book for her mother to try (or at least get a kick out of the instructions). Hermione knew what she wanted to get Petunia, and where she needed to buy it, but she was hesitating on Lily.</p><p>In Gladrags, she was rubbing the fabric of a beautiful green shawl that she knew would look wonderful on her peaches-and-cream sister, but a part of her - the bitter, nasty part that was all Hermione Granger hexing Marietta Edgecombe - was telling her to leave Lily off her Christmas list this year.</p><p>Barty, in a mild snit over searching for his own presents for his parents (his mother was always easy - her favourite soaps - but what do you get an absent, if not overbearing, father who only ever expressed disappointment in you and your achievements?), had wandered off toward the hats, leaving Regulus and Hermione together. Regulus didn't shop at Madam Malkin's ("Too plebeian," he once said to them, "I'm expected to buy from Twillfit."), but he remained to be with his friends.</p><p>"Are you going to get it?" he asked quietly, silvery eyes focused on her face.</p><p>Hermione frowned. "It'll be obvious if I exclude her."</p><p>"But you want to."</p><p>"God, yes." Hermione gave a tiny laugh, but it was self-deprecating and bitter. "Is it wrong of me? To feel this way about family?"</p><p>Regulus raised his eyebrows. "Hermione. Have you <em>met</em> me? I think the Blacks write the entire series on family drama."</p><p>She huffed a laugh.</p><p>"Really, though," sighed Regulus, "You should probably buy it. One, if she hasn't bought you anything - you come out better for being the bigger person. And two, if she <em>has</em> bought you something, it's likely something small and cheap that shows she doesn't know you well or didn't put thought into your present - unlike what you're doing." He smirked. "Either way, you look good."</p><p>Hermione laughed. "Spoken like a true Slytherin. Alright; I'll buy this."</p><p>They walked to the register, and Hermione fished out the appropriate galleons for the green shawl. Regulus kindly reached for the bagged item, he and Barty carrying all her purchases ("It's a Pureblood thing, Evans," they told her during their first Hogsmeade outings, a long time ago), when Hermione caught sight of something just past Malkin's window and the two black-haired teens heading in their direction.</p><p>"Say, Reg?"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"You know what you were saying about cornerstone on family drama?"</p><p>Regulus turned to look at her in suspicion. "Yes…?"</p><p>"It's about to walk into the store," she finished, just as the door pushed open and the bell above it tinkled and chimed, signalling new customers. The two stomped their feet, huffing loud breaths and chuckling to themselves as they basked in the warmth of the shop over the chilly December air. The two looked up at the same time and caught Hermione and Regulus standing still.</p><p>Silver eyes widened and Sirius gasped out, "Reg-!" just as James' mouth stretched into a lop-sided smile as he said, "Hermione."</p><p>A red-mittened hand rose in the air to touch his hair, but all it did was make it static, crackling and sticking up in worse directions than it had previously.</p><p>Hermione squelched the desire to laugh. "Black. Pott-"</p><p>"<em>James</em>," interjected James warningly, likening back to their previous conversations.</p><p>"James," sighed Hermione in correction. "What brings you two by Madam Malkin's?"</p><p>"New robes for Remus," said Sirius, eyes darting between James and Hermione, and then back to Regulus. "It's his Yule present."</p><p>"That's kind of you," said Regulus, although the way he said it fully implied his thoughts on the charity.</p><p>Hermione elbowed him.</p><p>While James goggled at their interaction, Sirius' eyes kept flickering to his younger brother, while he nervously smoothing down his robes.</p><p>"I decided to just get him another fucking hat," came Barty's voice, griping and bitter as he strode toward Hermione and Regulus, a thunderous look on his face with a scowl set deep. "Just as I do every year."</p><p>He immediately froze upon seeing James and Sirius, a shuttered look falling over his face, which drastically paled. His scowl deepened until it was a harsh upside-down U on his thin face. "What're <em>they</em> doing here?"</p><p>James flushed, glancing around and stammering, but Sirius's grey eyes flashed. "Shopping, Crouch. No crime against that."</p><p>Barty's already frosty demeanour chilled further. "Oh, no - no crime in shopping at all, but hey, Black, let's talk about full moons, what do you say-"</p><p>"<em>Barty</em>!" hissed Hermione, reaching out and clutching at his arm. "<em>Not here</em>!"</p><p>Her friend didn't even glance down at her, his eyes focused on Sirius, who was now glaring at the much taller (but skinnier) Ravenclaw.</p><p>"Got something you want to say, Crouch?" taunted Sirius, stepping forward.</p><p>Hermione, trapped between the two, glanced worriedly between them as Crouch drew himself to his full height.</p><p>"Plenty," hissed Crouch, leaning over Hermione's form to push his face into Sirius's space.</p><p>"Enough," broke in Regulus, stepping forward and drawing Barty back just as James did with Sirius. "For one, this isn't the place for any kind of - of Muggle <em>knock down</em> - so, both of you - enough. Second, Unbreakable Vow, remember? So let's try <em>not</em> to lose our magic."</p><p>Barty shrugged Regulus off, his eyes flashing from brown to amber quickly. "Forget it, Reg. I'm leaving. Can't stand to be in the presence of shit right now."</p><p>"Barty…"</p><p>Hermione's voice trailed off after her friend, but he only paused at the door, not even during his head much as he apologized to her. "I'll… I'll talk to you later, Hermione. Just… not now."</p><p>He tossed a hand in the air and was then through the door, his tailored robes blending in with the crowd outside until his height was swallowed and he was gone, leaving the other four behind.</p><p>"Wanker left all our purchases for me to carry, too," muttered Regulus, finally.</p><p>Hermione stifled a snort, turning back to her other friend. Her eyes glittered as she held out her hand. "Oh, give them here, you big baby."</p><p>Affronted, Regulus drew the bags closer to himself and turned his body away. "Hermione!"</p><p>"Oh, c'mon, Reg," chided Hermione gently, reaching for a strap and pulling it gently toward her. "How are you going to eat lunch if you're hoarding Yule presents? Don't you need your hands free?"</p><p>"She's got a point there, baby brother," grinned Sirius.</p><p>Regulus shot Sirius a look that clearly read <em>traitor</em>. While he did so, Hermione darted forward and sent a wandless stinging hex at Regulus' hand, the one holding her bags. He yelped as they fell, but James Potter was there, catching them with his quick Chaser reflexes. He was flushed with success when he stood from his stoop. "<em>Ah ha</em>!"</p><p>"Oh, my hero," grinned Hermione, looking up at James.</p><p>The Gryffindor preened, his cheeks turning a dusty pink and he went to run his hand through his hair - again - but this time the weight of the bags in his mittened hands kept them down.</p><p>"Reg," began Sirius tentatively. "Since I'm staying with the Potters, do you have time for lunch?"</p><p>Regulus frowned, glancing between Hermione and his brother.</p><p>Sirius, catching it, quickly added, "Hermione and James can come with if you don't want to leave her unescorted."</p><p>Hermione's good mood dipped southward and her eyes narrowed. "Unescorted?"</p><p>"Pureblood thing," all three boys said, at once, in the same dry tone.</p><p>It was Hermione's turn to scowl. Despite that, she turned to Regulus and spoke in an undertone, knowing that as animagi - or wizards who just recently attained their animal form - James and Sirius could hear her.</p><p>"You can go, it's okay," she murmured, face tilted up to him. "It's your brother - when will you really get this chance again?"</p><p>Regulus's eyes darted over her face and toward her brother, something unreadable in them. Then, he sighed, a tiny little sound, and nodded once. He handed her one more bag - the shawl for Lily - and then shrunk his (using the ambient magic and numerous adult wizards to hide his location for the tracking spell on his wand), pocketing his miniature gifts.</p><p>"Lead the way, Sirius," said Regulus, partly resigned.</p><p>Sirius perked up, his shoulders thrown back, and a bright look in his eyes as Regulus agreed. "Alright, great!" He clapped James on the shoulder and barked out, "Later, Jimmy!" as he and Regulus walked out of the shop.</p><p>It left James and Hermione in awkward silence.</p><p>"So, how's your holiday-"</p><p>"Did you want to grab a Butterbeer-"</p><p>They both stopped, staring at each other, and then laughed. Hermione bit her lip and watched as James glanced to the floor and then at her, shifting her bags from one hand to the other.</p><p>"So. Um. Did you want to hang out…?" asked James, carefully, looking at Hermione from under his eyebrows with his chin tilted down a bit.</p><p>"I have one last gift to get," replied Hermione. "I could… probably use your help."</p><p>"My help?" James looked astonished for a moment and then grinned. "Yeah, alright. Let's go."</p><p>He reached forward and caught her hand with his mittened one, and then was pulling her out of the store.</p><p>"Don't you need to get Lupin's gift?" laughed Hermione, causing James to halt abruptly, flush a very deep red and make an about-turn directly back into the shop.</p><p>Hermione waited outside for all of three minutes, arms crossed and an amused look on her face when James slinked out, sheepishly shrinking his own package so it was tucked into his pocket.</p><p>"So. Um. Where to?" he asked, stumbling a bit over his words.</p><p>"Zonko's," replied Hermione.</p><p>James' eyes went wide. "<em>Zonko's</em>?" he repeated incredulously. Then a slow grin began to spread across his face. "Why, Miss Evans, do I want to know?"</p><p>Hermione bit back her own answering grin and the two began walking. As they did so, she explained, "It's for my sister."</p><p>"Lily?" James' brows furrowed in concern and confusion. "I didn't know you were talking to each other again-"</p><p>"We're not," replied Hermione shortly, cutting him off. "It's for Petunia."</p><p>"Your older, Muggle sister," James answered, nodding. "Right." Then he paused, looking down at her curiously. "So, why um, Zonko's?"</p><p>Hermione felt her lips curl into a smile as she peered up at him. "What do you know about Tuney?"</p><p>James frowned. "Not much. Uh, I mean, I've heard Evans mention that she was a bit of a cow-" he winced. "Sorry, I-"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "No, that's alright. Tuney can be petty when she wants." She glanced at James and added, cheekily, "I guess it's an Evans thing."</p><p>Taking the olive branch, James grinned. He skittered a bit closer to her and bumped his shoulder with hers. "Oh, is it?"</p><p>"Anyway, Tuney's about three years older than me, so she's in her first year of uni," explained Hermione. "One of her worst traits is her need for gossip, I swear that girl has an ear to the ground in Yorkshire - knew everything that was going on. She had a great network of informants, too…"</p><p>James chuckled. "She would've made an interesting Slytherin."</p><p>"You think?" Hermione paused thoughtfully. "She'd definitely never be a Gryffindor; she's not brash at all. A bit fickle with her loyalty, but once you have it, you have it. I guess she'd have been Ravenclaw or Slytherin." She shrugged. "Like I was saying, she's a gossip hound."</p><p>"So what does that have to do with Zonko's?"</p><p>"I'm getting there! Stop interrupting," chided Hermione, glaring at James.</p><p>He held his hands up, her bags banging together. "Sorry, sorry!"</p><p>"Tuney probably could've been a stay-at-home mum or a secretary, but with her A-Levels in English and her gossip skills, I <em>may </em>have… well, suggested that journalism was a good option for her?" finished Hermione. "Of course, she took it one step further, and decided she wants to be an investigative journalist…"</p><p>Understanding lit on James' face. "And Zonko's carries that lock pick set…"</p><p>"Mm-hmm," agreed Hermione easily. "And a few other products she could use."</p><p>Zonko's was noisy and busy, filled with screaming children and exasperated parents, many of whom looked nervously around at the items their children were buying and expressing interest in. Hermione and James quickly made their way to the lock pick section, which also included invisible ink, feathered dusters with powder in them for print dusting, a self-updated case book, omnioculars, and even spell-revealing magnifying glasses.</p><p>Hermione bought a little of everything, samples for Petunia to try and use. Hermione paid and then James was pushing her through the throng of people to the doors. The two breathed in deeply the moment they exited the hot store, sharing glances.</p><p>"That was insane," muttered James, looking a bit stressed.</p><p>"Christmas shopping," replied Hermione easily with a tiny shrug.</p><p>"Well, I could do with a pick-me-up after that," retorted James, reaching out and taking Hermione's hand again. She glanced down in surprise at the red mitten and warm hand encircling her cold and mitten-less fingers, and then back up to James who was pointedly looking forward.</p><p>They walked in silence for a few moments before James asked, "So. How's Cresswell?"</p><p>Hermione blinked. "Dirk? Um. He's okay? I guess? The last I spoke to him?"</p><p>"Aren't you doing anything for Yule him?" asked James, curiously as he glanced at her.</p><p>"We're not dating, you know that," replied Hermione, brows furrowed. "Is that what people think? We literally had one date to Hogsmeade, and it was like… Marty and Lorraine."</p><p>James stared. "<em>Who</em>?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "Uh, never mind - you wouldn't know them -" Her voice dropped as she muttered, "For like, another decade anyway, God-" She cleared her throat. "It was like kissing my brother. If I had one. Just… yeah."</p><p>"Oh," said James, shortly. "I'm… sorry."</p><p>And he truly did sound sorry, like he was upset that things didn't work out for Hermione. She looked up at him, catching his hazel eyes as they peered down at her. There was something solemn in them, something else that she couldn't quite identify, but it was enough that she tugged on his hand and his lips stretched into a smile.</p><p>They had stopped walking, standing in the middle of the cobblestone path that ran through Diagon Alley, forcing people to move around them as they continued with their shopping. Snowflakes began to gently fall, and tiny puffs of white air escaped their mouths as they breathed. James's cheeks and nose were turning red, but there was a sparkle to his eyes, turning them more green than brown, and he was tilting his face down -</p><p>Hermione's breath caught -</p><p>"James, darling!"</p><p>The two sprung back, both glancing to their right to a cafe. A stately woman with black hair streaked with grey in beautiful grey dress robes was standing next to a man with a messy mop of thick grey hair, in black robes. Her hand was tucked into the man's elbow, and her eyes were darting between James and Hermione as they walked toward them.</p><p>At her side, James sighed. "Mum, dad."</p><p>Bewildered, Hermione's eyes widened and she took in Harry's grandparents. She had never seen images of Charlus and Dorea Potter - Harry's album was rather bare when it came to him in his first year - so she eagerly traced their features for remnants of Harry. She found it in Charlus' hair, in the slope of Dorea's nose and eyebrows, in Charlus' chin.</p><p>James directed Hermione through the crowd until he was standing in front of his parents, his hand still trapping hers. "Mum, Dad - we've been shopping together since Sirius went off for lunch with his brother."</p><p>Dorea's thin eyebrows shot upward just as Charlus gave a low whistle. "They're speaking again?" he asked.</p><p>James glanced at Hermione, who shrugged. "It's an ongoing process."</p><p>Dorea also glanced at Hermione, her silvery eyes almost preternatural. "And who is this, James?"</p><p>Hermione immediately felt three sets of eyes focusing on her and froze. James, who still held Hermione's hand, smiled brightly. "Mum, Dad, this is Hermione Evans."</p><p>Dorea and Charlus exchanged a quick glance.</p><p>"Evans?" asked Charlus, lightly, as he turned back to her.</p><p>"Any relation to Miss Lily Evans?" continued Dorea, but there was something dark in her eyes as she surveyed Hermione up and down.</p><p>Inwardly, Hermione winced. She quickly dropped James' hand, as if it burned her. "My older sister."</p><p>James cottoned on quickly to his parents' disapproval and hurriedly said, "Hermione was the one who was tutoring me in Arithmancy, mum."</p><p>Dorea's eyes widened. "Wait – <em>you're</em> Pythas' prodigy? The one he keeps going on about, being only fourteen, but writing her NEWTs?"</p><p>"Fifteen now, but yes, that was me," replied Hermione, relaxing minutely. "Unless there is another student at Hogwarts who did the same as me."</p><p>"There's no one else like you," said James, revealing that same lopsided grin.</p><p>Hermione felt her cheeks warm and she glanced away.</p><p>"That's quite the accomplishment," continued Dorea, glancing between the two. Her voice was much nicer, now. "Are you in Gryffindor with James, dear?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "Ravenclaw."</p><p>"Of course you are," chuckled Charlus. This time, husband and wife shared a glance that was loaded with something Hermione didn't quite identify but had seen often between her own parents in her original timeline and even between Leonard and Rose Evans of her present.</p><p>"Have either of you eaten?" asked Dorea, once she turned away from her husband. "I'd imagine that Sirius will be some time if he's catching up with Regulus."</p><p>"Not yet, mum," replied James easily.</p><p>"Then you should join us," invited Dorea, clearly the spokesperson of the Potter family. "You as well, Ms. Evans."</p><p>The woman nodded decisively, stepping away from Charlus to wrap her arm around Hermione and draw her away from James, and down toward the cafe that they had seen the elder Potters heading toward before they spotted them.</p><p>Unable to see a way out of it, Hermione plastered a smile on her face and allowed Dorea to make small talk as they were seated by the window, overlooking the Alley. At the four-person table, Hermione was tucked closest to the window with James at her side, and Dorea and Charlus opposite her.</p><p>The quaint cafe was patterned like the night's sky, painted blue and black with dotted fairies and luminescent painted stars making the space feel cozy. Given a menu, Hermione glanced through the items – mostly bite-sized nibbles – and was amused to see the items were based off astronomy, as well.</p><p>They ordered, and Hermione grabbed the linen serviette, placing it on her lap and wringing it under the table where the elder Potters couldn't see her. It was nerve-wracking, being in the presence of Harry's grandparents.</p><p>"Are you doing your Yule shopping, dear?" asked Dorea as her tea was delivered.</p><p>Hermione nodded. "I've finished everything for my family. I just need to get something for my friend, now."</p><p>Charlus nodded, tilting his head in James' direction. "Ah yes, you mentioned you're a Ravenclaw, so your friend – is she one, too?"</p><p>Hermione glanced at James from the corner of her eye before replying. He nodded encouragingly. "<em>He</em>; and yes, he is."</p><p>Charlus still had a pleasant look on his face. "What's your friends' name? Maybe I can suggest something if James hasn't already..."</p><p>"I wouldn't even know where to begin with a present for Crouch," sighed James, rolling his eyes.</p><p>"Crouch?" Dorea's eyebrows shot up. "Surely not Bartemius Crouch's son? The Head Auror?"</p><p>"Yes," answered Hermione, watching James' parents carefully. They already had a low opinion of her sister; adding her best friend wasn't going to improve the situation.</p><p>"Hmm," hummed Dorea, a calculating look in her eyes as she surveyed Hermione anew.</p><p>Hermione could understand it; Lily was a prefect, a popular Muggle-born Gryffindor that James pined after for many years. Lily was bubbly, outgoing, vivacious, and for the most part, everyone liked her. Now, suddenly, Hermione appeared – a broody, quiet Ravenclaw Muggleborn who happened to be best friends with two prominent Purebloods – a Crouch, with connections to the Ministry, and a <em>Black</em> of all people, one of the purest Pureblood names out there.</p><p>From an outside perspective, Hermione was a walking, talking warning label: <em>Here be a dangerous witch</em>.</p><p>Luckily, their food arrived before any more questions could be asked, and perhaps, sensing the mood, James launched into the story of Sirius trying to get Hermione's attention the previous holiday season and her punching him (<em>am I never going to live that down?</em> wondered Hermione sadly) that had both Potters chuckling.</p><p>And that was when the world exploded.</p><p>The glass in front of them cracked and splintered, shards flying into the cafe just as the resulting blast sent the four of them head over heels, tumbling backward as heat rippled across Hermione's skin.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, blinking back spots, she was lying flat on her back on the floor of the cafe, splintered wooden bits of the table surrounding her. James was on his side an arm's length away, pushing himself up and a gash across his cheek, bleeding profusely. His parents were nearby, Charlus already partially up, in a crouch and shouting something at other patrons while helping Dorea to her feet.</p><p>Outside the cafe, there were screams and flashes of sickly shades red, green, yellow spellfire, and cruel laughter. The noise was incredible – bits of snow from the ground was thrown in the air and came falling down in clouds of thick powder, and blood splattered across larger piles. There were some unmoving bodies nearby and Hermione swallowed thickly as she sat up, leaning on one side.</p><p>It was too much – too similar to the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione's wand hand twitched, and her instincts – dull from time and from her fuzzy memories – only had enough time to scream a warning at her; she abandoned the idea of using her wand at all and just thrust her free hand out.</p><p>The remains of the table, split in two and leaning on its side, warped and curved, creating a partial dome over Charlus and Dorea – the inner curl of a wave – just as the two green <em>Avada Kedavra</em>s hit, sending chunks of wood spinning off in Hermione and James' direction.</p><p>On her knees, Hermione swept her hands and the chucks went spiralling into the wall. She began breathing heavily, and blinked, eyes wide. She had <em>never</em> used her magic – or her transmutation abilities – to that degree before, and certainly not without serious visualization.</p><p>"<em>What was that?</em>" James whispered, suddenly at her side and wrapping a large hand around her arm as he helped her to her feet.</p><p>"I—" Hermione didn't have an answer planned, but whatever she wanted to say was stopped when she shoved at James, sending him a few steps back, shock on his face.</p><p>"Hermione-!"</p><p>But then a sickly looking yellow spell flew between them, hitting a chair. The wood began to rot, and warp and the cushion faded before the threads unravelled and turned to dust. The entire decomposition took less than four or five seconds, James' mouth open wide as he realized Hermione saved him from the curse.</p><p>"<em>Holy shit</em>," breathed James, turning back to face Hermione.</p><p>She was looking out the window, brows furrowed. There was something on the air... a familiar sound... the cackle, sharp and high, penetrated Hermione's faded memories.</p><p><em>Bellatrix</em>.</p><p>Then Hermione was striding forward, toward the broken window, slipping her wand from her sleeve, feeling the comforting thrum of her magic course through her.</p><p>"James! Hermione! <em>No!</em>" Dorea's voice, high and panicked, stopped James long enough to glance back at his parents; they had their wands out, making their way toward the two. Dorea, although worried for her son, had a fierce look on her aristocratic face, carved out of marble. Charlus was all fire, snapping instructions to those nearby who had their wands out and managing the cafe with the ease of a man who was used to giving orders and having those order <em>obeyed</em>.</p><p>They weren't Hermione's parents, though – she used a relatively intact chair to step on the seat and then on the thick frame of the window, kicking some shards left until they broke and then stood on the frame. She was a large target, but she could also see down the Alley – and at the robed figures near Flourish and Blotts.</p><p>There were no Death Eater masks – maybe there wouldn't be for a bit longer – but it was unmistakably them, even with the hoods of their robes drawn over and low, and an obscuring charm cast over the inside hood to conceal their faces. Hermione knew those tactics, knew that one laugh and knew how they fought.</p><p>There were six of them – not a large number, but enough. Bellatrix was one, next to a tall wizard with thrown back shoulders sending off spells with a snappy whip-motion – Hermione knew that was Rodolphus LeStrange.</p><p>There were two others, larger than the rest and causing more destruction with heavy-handed spell fire that was meant to blow things up. Another figure – one Hermione couldn't tell if they were male or female – was transfiguring the cobblestones as shields and was their defense.</p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes and ignored them to focus on the last man, a lasso of hissing and spitting fire attached to his wand's tip. Then, that wizard turned his wand, raising it with a slashing motion toward the bookstore.</p><p>A family, huddled on the cold ground in front of the store, scrambled out of the way with the wizard pushing his children ahead of him.</p><p><em>Oh, I don't think so!</em> thought Hermione, and send a nonverbal <em>expelliarmus</em> at the Death Eater.</p><p>The wizard wasn't expecting it, and he yelped as his wand was wrenched from his grip, flying backward and disappearing into a snow bank between two shops. His shocked cry was enough to get Bellatrix's attention, and she turned, mockingly calling, "Oh, poor little wizard lost his wand!"</p><p>The wizard turned back to Bellatrix, but the woman ignored him and caught sight of Hermione, leaning out of the shop window.</p><p>"Do you want to play, little schoolgirl?" the other witch called, brandishing her own wand as she assumed a duelling stance. She held her wand above her head and brought out her left arm to counter her weight.</p><p>Hermione disdainfully eyed Bellatrix's pose. A duelling stance was no good on the battlefield, and as far as Hermione was concerned, this was no game. The Ravenclaw stepped out of the cafe, her boots crunching the snow below her. She had taken off her jacket when she sat, but Hermione could barely feel the cold. Her blood was thrumming, pulsing through her body with her magic. She was running hot and ready to fight.</p><p>The alley was still populated with shoppers, between the two women. A few people were lying motionless, their bodies riddled with marks and some, surrounded in a pool of drying blood; a few teen witches were crying, clutching each other near Malkin's, and a few elderly wizards and witches out for a stroll were either disarmed or inching their way down the alley and away from the robed figures.</p><p>Without warning, Hermione snapped off a skin-stripping spell – a charm for tanning cattle and nothing that was illegal but certainly had the ability to be dark. Bellatrix didn't recognize the dark brown colour, but smartly sidestepped it; it instead hit a charmed plant in front of a store behind her, and all the leaves withered and fell off.</p><p>The other woman paused, staring at the plant before slowly turning back to Hermione. "That wasn't very nice," she said, her voice low and surprised.</p><p>"Attacking a busy shopping area isn't nice, either," retorted Hermione with a snort.</p><p>Bellatrix tilted her head, the hood remaining in place. "True." Then she sent off her own spells – a flurry of red, white, and yellow. The spells flew by, and Hermione ducked, dodging. The spells slammed into the brick of the shops, sending crumbling stone onto a group of girls, who shrieked and covered their heads with their hands instead of using <em>protego</em>.</p><p>Hermione brought her wand up. <em>"Expulso</em>!"</p><p>Bellatrix twisted out of the spell's way, sending shards of cobblestone at Hermione. She prepared a wind spell to send the shards back, but a giant slab of stone rose between her and the shards, taking the brunt of them.</p><p>Hermione turned; James crouched in the frame of the cafe window, his own wand out.</p><p>"Thanks," she called, knowing she had it handled.</p><p>He nodded back, hazel eyes hardening as they turned back to the robed figures. He stepped out of the window frame, flicking his wand up. For a moment, nothing happened, and then the ground shook – loose stones from the spellfire trembled and began to rise, hovering in the air. Then, like the center of a black hole sucking things in, the loose stones began to clump together until they formed a giant troll, which let out a rumbling roar and began to lumber toward the other robed figures.</p><p>Hermione took advantage of James' transfiguration and charm work, sending several <em>Sectumsempra</em> curses at Bellatrix. One caught her in the upper leg, making her shriek in pain, but she managed to avoid the other two.</p><p>The angered witch let out a wordless scream, sending <em>crucio</em> toward Hermione. Hermione crouched to avoid the spell, but the second after it hit her in the chest, sending her flying back, winded. Her wand skittered away, out of reach. She gasped, struggled to breathe with what felt like the weight of the entire Hogwarts Express sitting on her sternum.</p><p>Stars appeared before her eyes, then Dorea was there, whispering something, and then Hermione could breathe, her lungs and ribs expanding without the same pain as before. She coughed and coughed some more as she rolled on her side.</p><p>She was facing forward, toward the Death Eaters. Charlus stood with James, both moving their wands in intricate, swishes and then flicks that turned the Alley into their playground; James' rock troll was attacking the two larger wizards, but their spells were damaging the creature and slowly carving out parts of its body or melting sections.</p><p>Charlus was using the shards from the cafe window, sending them flying toward the fire-lasso wizard and them boomeranging them when they flew past; the wizard cursed and barely managed to avoid the second pass from behind, flinging himself to the floor.</p><p><em>Disapparation jinx is up,</em> thought Hermione grimly, looking around until she realized Rodolphus was monitoring the entire fight, holding himself back as he surveyed how things were going. He <em>is the one charge – the one holding the jinx!</em></p><p>Hermione pushed herself up from her stomach, groaning as pain rippled across her shoulders and chest. She blindly held out her right hand, patting the slush and dirt for her wand. After a few moments of not finding it, she grit her teeth and rose to her feet.</p><p>"Ms. Evans – Hermione!" Dorea's voice was sharp, glancing back from where she stood in front of the Ravenclaw, keeping her from Bellatrix's sight. She flicked her wand to deflect another of Bellatrix's spells as she did so.</p><p>Distracted, she didn't see Bellatrix's next spell – but Hermione did. Hermione thrust out her hand, a nonverbal and wandless <em>ventus</em> erupting and sending Hermione back to her knees from the force.</p><p>The wind blasted forward, toward Bellatrix. It was strong enough to send Dorea stumbling to the side, closing her eyes tight to the blast as it whipped up debris, dirt, and snow into a strong, furious swirl. It hit Bellatrix hard, sending her flying back and over the flame-lasso wizard who was slowly rising to his knees. Both fell back to the ground.</p><p><em>They're not fighting like they did at the Battle,</em> thought Hermione, breathing heavily as she rose to her feet and wiped at her sweaty face with her hand. <em>These aren't the same killers I fought... they barely know what they're doing now.</em></p><p>With that in mind and a dark smile, Hermione knelt, pressing her hands to the cobblestone. Her magic crackled and blue sparks erupted like electricity from her hands, racing down the cracks in the stone in an uneven, jagged line, splitting toward Bellatrix and the other wizard while another branch went to James' rock troll.</p><p>Bellatrix yelped, jumping back to avoid the crackling energy as the cobblestones split and the fracture stones burst violently upward in spikes and shards.</p><p>Two large pieces caught the wizard with her, a sharp point slashing through his robes and stomach, spilling blood. The second burst upward with enough force and speed it severed his leg completely. He screamed, falling to the ground.</p><p>The energy racing up the rock troll fused itself in all its cracks, fixing the chunks the other wizards had made in the creature. It raised its hands and brought them down hard on the cobblestone, one hand narrowly missing one of the wizards. The ground shuddered and that wizard fell to his feet; nearby shoppers screamed in terror.</p><p>The other wizard avoided the hands coming down, but didn't avoid the backslap the rock troll made, sending him flying into the side of Eeylops Owl Emporium. The owls in the cages in the main window hooted and ruffled their feathers, sending grey and white and brown everywhere as they tried to avoid the wizard as he slumped bonelessly to the ground.</p><p>Rodolphus and the defending Death Eater were the last two, both standing warily out of the way. Hermione could feel Rodolphus' eyes on her, lingering as Bellatrix immobilized the bleeding wizard. He gave some sort of unspoken command, and the Disapparation jinx came crashing down –</p><p>Hermione shouted something, wordlessly, clenching her hands on the cobblestone beneath her –</p><p>A row of stone shards burst from the ground around the Death Eaters, a mountain range growing in a line toward the group, but just as it reached them, they disapparated, leaving Hermione panting and kneeling in the middle of Diagon Alley.</p><p>The quiet following everything - the lack of spellfire, or the screams and cries of those caught unaware, the <em>pop</em> of disapparation - left a deafening silence. Everything was hypersensitive: Hermione could hear her harsh pants, feel a trickle of sweat as it made its way down her spine, and felt her magic tingle and pool near her wand hand…</p><p>"-ione? Hermione! Are you okay?"</p><p>Someone grabbed her by the arms, pulling her up and then, close.</p><p>She blinked and stared up at James. His hazel eyes were wide and there was a trickle of blood creeping its way down his cheek and under his jaw. The collar of his robes was already stained darker, indicating it had been oozing for a bit.</p><p>"<em>Hermione</em>!"</p><p>"I'm okay," the words were fuzzy and felt thick leaving her mouth, but as soon as she said, she knew it was true. The silence from the attack disappeared and sound came roaring back in: there were loud, heart-wrenching sobs somewhere, and a few shrill shouts for a mediwizard. Pops of apparation and blood red Auror robes swarmed around Diagon Alley, mixing in with the stains of red on the cobblestones and snow.</p><p>James gave her a dubious glance.</p><p>"You don't seem okay," he said, quietly, his eyes flicking down. Hermione followed his gaze and realized she had her left hand pressed tight against her shoulder, near her clavicle.</p><p>She made a tiny noise of surprise.</p><p>"My dear," inserted a feminine voice, and both James and Hermione looked toward it. It was Dorea, James' mother, who, with a pinched, worried look on her face, eased next to James with her wand out. "Let me take a look at that."</p><p>Hermione watched as Dorea moved closer, keeping her movements deliberate, fluid as her wand came up, and Hermione's hand fell from pressing against her shoulder. Dorea's mouth moved but no sound emerged as she cast her spells, and save for a brief heating of the area, Hermione did not notice anything cast on her body.</p><p>The grimace on Dorea's face was pronounced, however. James noticed it. "What? Mum, what is it? What's wrong?"</p><p>"Broken clavicle," she murmured in response. "Nothing some Skele-Gro can't fix."</p><p>"I can wait until I'm back at Hogwarts," replied Hermione evenly, her mind casting back to her time on the run when she and Harry starved themselves. The broken bone, although painful, especially when she breathed or attempted to move her right arm, was nowhere near the same pain that Bellatrix's cruciatius had on her.</p><p>"<em>Hogwarts</em>?" repeated a horrified Charlus, his hazel eyes wide as his greying eyebrows shot up under his messy hair.</p><p>Dorea seemed to echo her husband's thoughts. "Surely not, Ms. Evans. I can have one of our house elves bring some home-brew to us-"</p><p>"I wouldn't want to impose-"</p><p>"You're not," interjected James, his eyes on her. His face was pinched and there was a furrow between his thick black eyebrows. "Hermione, <em>please</em>."</p><p>Hermione sighed, and her shoulder twinged in pain. She grimaced and then nodded. "Alright – but I should probably be getting home." <em>And I need to let Barty and Reg know I'm okay, too.</em></p><p>"Of course," agreed Dorea in her victory with a soft smile. She turned to her son. "James, do you know where Ms. Evans lives?"</p><p>"I've never been—" the other teen started.</p><p>"Cokesworth," replied Hermione, interrupting the two. She was suddenly very tired. "We can use the Knight Bus—"</p><p>"I know the area," interrupted Charlus quietly. "We have ties to one of the steel companies."</p><p>James goggled. "We <em>do</em>?"</p><p>Charlus sent his son a <em>look</em>. "Not now, James. This isn't the time to go over our family's holdings."</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>"Dory, can you stay and inform the Aurors where we are? I won't have them speak to Ms. Evans without one of us present," asked Charlus, turning to his wife.</p><p>Dorea nodded, her eyes already moving to fixate on a few of the late red-robed Aurors that began popping into the Alley or Floo'ing through connections, pouring out of places like Florean Fortesque's.</p><p>"Ms. Evans, I'm going to Side-Along you and James," continued Charlus, turning to face Hermione. She blinked and focused on the older man. "Have you Side-Along Apparated before?"</p><p>"Erm—" She didn't want to lie but she didn't want to tell the truth either.</p><p>Time, however, seemed to be of the essence for Charlus Potter as the Aurors moved closer, a few people in the Alley pointing their way. The man muttered an apology as James stepped closer and he reached for Hermione and his son in one movement, spinning on his heel.</p><p>Hermione's breath caught as they disapparated and their <em>pop</em> just outside the abandoned quarry on the far side of Cokesworth echoed across the dirt and stone.</p><p>James was wide-eyed, looking around in fascination while Charlus brushed himself off absently, casting a look at the quarry that made him sigh. "How far is your home from here, Ms. Evans?"</p><p>"About ten minutes," Hermione replied, already walking. She was dressed in Muggle clothes, but neither Potter were. "You might want to change your appearance."</p><p>They began walking out of the quarry and down a dirt road between farmer's fields until the fields turned to a few detached cottages in stone. Then, the houses turned into a pub, a few shops, and then row houses, all with the same square and stone design that lined both sides of the street. Some had English flags hanging from the front, but most were unadorned.</p><p>"Cheerful place," muttered James, glancing about. When he realized what he said, he blushed, and mortified, turned to Hermione. "I am so sorry—"</p><p>"No, that's about right," she replied. "It's dour here. There's high unemployment from a lack of mining jobs, and we're too far from Leeds for commerce; not to mention, we're not on the sea."</p><p>Their walk through town was quick as Hermione kept them to the side streets and away from the main shopping area, small as it was. Soon they stopped at an end unit, the only distinguishable feature separating it from the rest. It was at the end of the long street, overlooking what should be a park but was a large, muddy field.</p><p>"This is me," she announced, almost grimly. Without anything else, Hermione stepped through the open gate, walked up to the path, and then opened the front door. Charlus and James followed silently, both cataloging the Muggle house as they entered the warm house from the chilly December air.</p><p>"Hermione, love, is that you?" a feminine voice called from the length of the narrow hallway behind a swinging door. "I thought you'd be longer out with your friends."</p><p>A woman in her early forties pushed the swinging door open, wiping her hands on a tea towel. She froze at the sight of the three of them standing in the same entry foyer, dropping her tea towel on the floor as she cried, "Hermione – you're bleeding!"</p><p>"Hey mum," said Hermione, realizing she must look a fright. "I came home early because there was a bit of an incident—"</p><p>"<em>Oh my God!</em>" Petunia's shrill voice from their left, in the living room, had Hermione turning.</p><p>Petunia, back from the term, was staring in horror at Hermione's dirt and blood-caked form, still missing her jacket just as behind her Leo appeared. From the top of the stairs and drawn by her mother and sister's voices, Lily appeared and began walking down them, her eyes flickering between her family and Charlus and James.</p><p>"Madam Evans," began Charlus, stepping forward, and then suddenly there were five voices trying to all speak at once.</p><p>Charlus moved to Rose and Leo, while Petunia flew toward her younger sister in a panic. Hermione turned to face her instead of Lily, who stood on the bottom stair, near enough to be part of the conversation.</p><p>"What <em>happened</em>?" demanded Petunia, her eyes flicking up and down Hermione's thin sleeves. She looked up, and barked, "Lily – go grab a wet towel from the toilet for Hermione, and some antiseptic!"</p><p>Hermione sighed, trying to fend off her sister's hands. "Tuney, I'm okay—"</p><p>"You're not, mum said you have a broken clavicle and need Skele-Gro," interjected James, his own eyes worried as he hovered at Hermione's other side.</p><p>"You have a <em>what</em>?" shrieked Rose, overhearing James as Charlus finished briefly explaining what happened. "What's Skele-Gro? Leo – quick, we need to get to the hospital-!"</p><p>"Skele-Gro is a potion that grows bones or fixes breaks in them," explained Charlus to both Petunia and Hermione's horrified parents. "It'll be uncomfortable but fine, once Ms. Evans drinks a bit. She'll be perfectly healed by tomorrow afternoon."</p><p>Rose and Petunia still looked skeptical, but Leo was intrigued. "Damn, I could've used that during my rugby days."</p><p>Charlus turned to Leo and asked, curiously, "Rugby?"</p><p>Lily came racing down the stairs, holding a wet towel in her hands that she thrust at Hermione. "Here, Hermione!"</p><p>Her eyes were wide, and she pressed between James and Petunia, edging out the other Gryffindor with her shoulder as the three sisters formed a huddled triangle. Hermione took the towel and began to wipe at her hands, which she could see were caked with dirt from when she fell and cast her transmutation.</p><p>Petunia made a noise, and then took the towel from Hermione, hauling her closer and beginning to rub at her fingers and palms with focused energy.</p><p>"Mr. Potter said there was an attack," said Lily quietly, looking between Hermione and James. "Like a terrorist attack? Like the IRA?"</p><p>Hermione took a moment to make the connection – in her time, the IRA was a product of history, with Sinn Féin leading Northern Ireland instead, but in the 1970s, the IRA was still very active and Ireland was currently experiencing the Troubles.</p><p>"The who?" asked James, confusion etched on his face. "Are they wizards?"</p><p>Petunia, done with Hermione's hands, moved closer and began to scrub at the blood on her neck and cheek. Hermione let her, although she shot a disgruntled look at Petunia who ignored it entirely, focused on a spot on Hermione's cheek instead.</p><p>"They're Muggles," answered Lily.</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>"I don't know who they were," lied Hermione, shaking her head, causing Petunia to make a noise of complaint.</p><p>"Don't move!" the eldest Evans sister instructed sternly.</p><p>Hermione heaved a long-suffering sigh and stilled, but she caught James' eyes. He smirked at her, his eyes laughing despite no sound coming from him. Hermione scowled at him instead, but his smirk turned into his lop-sided grin instead.</p><p>This was all done without any words – and with Lily watching the two.</p><p>"Did you meet up at Diagon to spend the day together?" she blurted, finally.</p><p>Petunia stopped scrubbing.</p><p>James sputtered, "What?"</p><p>"Did you?" she demanded, green eyes flicking between the two.</p><p>Hermione frowned. "I was with Barty and Reg. Speaking of, I should owl them to let them know I'm okay."</p><p>James nodded. "We should probably go home. Sirius probably went straight there if he couldn't find us at the Alley."</p><p>Charlus, overhearing his son, turned away from Leo. It seemed the two were having a lively discussion on sports, with Rose stuck between the two, torn between seeing to her youngest daughter or being amused by the two men.</p><p>"A solid plan, James," the eldest Potter said. "Your mother is probably expecting us." He turned to Hermione, still in Petunia's grip. "Ms. Evans, I'll have one of our house elves come by later tonight with a bottle of Skele-Gro for you to take."</p><p>Hermione nodded. "Thank you."</p><p>There was a fond look in his eyes as he surveyed her. "I should be thanking <em>you</em>. I did see what you wall blocked. Without you, I don't think my wife and I would be here."</p><p>James made a noise as if realizing only then what could've happened to his parents.</p><p>Charlus walked down the narrow hall, at the cluster in front of the door. Lily was forced to step back on the stairs, out of the way, while Petunia and Hermione moved into the living room, leaving James and Charlus by the front door.</p><p>The wizard stopped in front of Hermione and made a tiny bow. "Thank you again, Ms. Evans. The Potters are in your debt."</p><p>James mimicked his father. "Thank you, Hermione."</p><p>"I did what any witch should do," she replied instead, looking between the two Potters. "But you're welcome."</p><p>Charlus placed a hand on James' shoulder. "Please rest up for the rest of your holiday."</p><p>"I'll..." James trailed off, glancing at his father and then back at Hermione, determinedly ignoring Petunia's narrowing eyes or Lily's widening ones. "I'll write to you, okay?"</p><p>"Okay," agreed Hermione easily.</p><p>Charlus spun on his heel and the two were gone with a loud <em>pop</em>, causing Rose to shriek, "What was that? Where did they go?" and then ask, "Did they not want to stay for a roast?"</p><p>"I think they have other things on their mind, mum," replied Hermione, turning to face her. Petunia took the opportunity and launched forward, renewing her scrubbing. "Ouch! Ouch, Tuney – lay off, that <em>hurts</em>!"</p><p>"Well, then don't go and nearly get yourself killed, idiot!" snapped Petunia, scrubbing harder.</p><p>"I wasn't <em>planning</em> on it, God," moaned Hermione.</p><p>"Hermione Jane Evans, watch your mouth," cautioned her mother, shaking her head and muttering something about witches under her breath before turning back into the kitchen.</p><p>Leo grinned, shaking his head. "Nice bloke, Charlus Potter." He cast a wink and a knowing look at his youngest when he finished, "Maybe you should ask that James around some time, 'Mione."</p><p>"Dad!" shouted Hermione at the same time as Lily.</p><p>He glanced between the two, something dawning on him as he did so. Then he shook his head, retreating into the living room.</p><p>Petunia used the dirty towel to point at Hermione and then upstairs. "Oi, you. Shift. To the toilet so I can finish scrubbing you clean."</p><p>"Ugh."</p><p>Hermione stomped up the stairs, past Lily who watched her go, biting her lower lip and playing with the ends of her hair nervously. Petunia followed with a satisfied look on her face.</p><p>In the bathroom, Hermione perched herself on the edge of the bathtub, her hands tucked between her knees as she scowled at Petunia standing in front of her by the sink. She had another towel in her hands. The two of them were silent as they heard the floorboard creak and groan as Lily walked by into her room, shutting the door.</p><p>Petunia sighed. "So that's James Potter."</p><p>Hermione tilted her head. "Yeah, and?"</p><p>"It's nice to put a face to a name, that's all," replied Petunia, but her voice was deceptively light. She turned around and held the cloth out. "Face the window so I can get at this cut on your cheek."</p><p>Hermione did as instructed, staring out at the muddy field. "I thought Lily was pretty descriptive when complaining about him.</p><p>"Yes," agreed Petunia, "But it's one thing hearing about a toerag that plays pranks and annoys her to seeing the wizard worried about <em>you</em>."</p><p>"What?" Hermione's heart stopped.</p><p>Petunia pulled back and stared at Hermione. "Didn't you realize? He totally fancies you. It honestly makes me wonder what he was doing with Lily. I mean, all those pranks? That was probably for attention. With you though, it's different." She paused. "Unless he pranks you too?"</p><p>"He doesn't," replied Hermione, eyes wide. "You think he – he <em>fancies</em> me?"</p><p>"Sure," nodded Petunia. "And I totally know these things, of course. Being the only one of the three of us with a boyfriend."</p><p>"Speaking of, how's Sean?" asked Hermione in hopes of changing the topic.</p><p>Petunia cast her sister a knowing look but answered, "Swell. He's down in London, too, you know."</p><p>"No, I didn't."</p><p>"<em>Mmhmm</em> – and you know, he's totally fit from rugby but your James? He's pretty dreamy, isn't he? A bit of a David Cassidy."</p><p>"TUNEY!"</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>January 1977</strong>
</p><p>The return to Hogwarts following one of the first public attacks by Death Eaters on Voldemort's orders was a quiet and tense one; to some degree, the wizards and witches of magical Britain were unsure of what to make of such a brazen and violent mark on Diagon Alley, thinking it signified something terrible to come. To others, it was just a political upstart and the Aurors would catch them soon enough, nothing more than a blip in wizarding life.</p><p>Hermione was one of the first category, who knew this was the quiet before the storm. Like the older generations, the ones who experienced and lived through not just Grindelwald, but earlier conflicts - they all recognized the signs and were wearily quiet. A few of the children on the Hogwarts Express were like Hermione (those with family who remembered), but the majority of her classmates and schoolmates were giddy, catching up with friends about their holidays and Yule gifts or where they went on vacation. None seemed to make the connection of Hermione and the Potters at the Alley, which she was thankful for.</p><p><em>Fools</em>, the bitter part of Hermione whispered as she did her best not to let her lip curl up in disgust as several seventh-year Slytherins strode past her, haughtily comparing their Yule presents to one another, trying to outdo the others in who received the best gifts.</p><p>Hermione's shoulder still twinged with phantom pain, despite Dorea Potter's kindness in healing her wound. Absently, Hermione raised a hand and rubbed her palm against the shoulder, near her clavicle, and grimaced.</p><p>It took only a few moments but she found Barty and Regulus already in a compartment, conversing in low tones. There was a strain on their faces - for Barty, it was the fact of hiding his near-lycanthropy from his parents on a daily basis while at home, and for Regulus, it was the knowledge of what occurred at Diagon Alley. Hermione was sure that Bellatrix - already a year married to Rodolphus Lestrange - had been involved. There were a few too many moments that sounded like her familiar cackle, or her brand of spellfire…</p><p>"'Lo, Hermione," muttered Barty, bags under his eyes as he tipped his head back to rest on the seat. He then closed his eyes. A full moon was looming, just a few days out.</p><p>Regulus nodded at her. "Had a good break?"</p><p>"Oh, peachy, after that little scuffle in Diagon," she replied, keeping her voice deceptively light to mask her sarcasm. She flopped down on the seat next to Barty, digging through her beaded bag to pull out a large text and a notebook for her thoughts.</p><p>In the meantime, they engaged in some small talk, some random bits of information tossed back and forth as the Hogwarts Express left London and began its meandering path north.</p><p>("How's Dirk?"</p><p>"Fine. You know we're not together anymore."</p><p>Barty's face lit up in joy. "I won't have to play nice?"</p><p>"You still have to play nice, stupid, he's my friend."</p><p>His face fell.)</p><p>Hermione allowed some time to pass before she thought to speak. Regulus was also reading a book, looking studious with a furrow between his brows, while Barty was slightly wheezing as his form of snoring, taking a nap with his head against the window. As such, Hermione tried to be as nonchalant as possible when she looked up from her book.</p><p>She pitched her voice into the most innocent muster she could. "Say, Barty…"</p><p>"Yes?" her friend replied, although his voice was slow from sleep.</p><p>"I have an idea for one of my transmutation circles," she began, a gleam in her eyes. Regulus now looked up across the compartment at his friends. "D'you think you could ask your dad or his contacts to get me some basilisk venom?"</p><p>Barty's eyes drifted open, now more a honey tone than the dark brown they previously were due to the disease running through his blood. They were hooded as his head rolled from the window to his opposite shoulder as he looked at Hermione, but eventually, he nodded. And yawned.</p><p>"Yeah, sure, no problem," he mumbled, eyes shut again. "Do you know how much you need?"</p><p>"Not too much. A hundred mil or so?"</p><p>Regulus's eyebrows shot up, and his eyes drifted between the two incredulously. "Why do you need basilisk venom?"</p><p>"Oh, well, I read this most interesting article in <em>Potions Quarterly</em> the other week," began Hermione, turning to Regulus and ensuring she sounded breathlessly excited as she spoke. Her eyes went wide and she stretched a smile across her face, despite feeling awful at the falsity of her intent. "And I was curious about this ritual that the Aztec used with basilisk venom in the ceremony of Huitzilopochtli-" Regulus was immediately envious of Hermione's ability to rattle of foreign names and words while pronouncing them correctly "-who, you might know, is the brother of Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec serpent God-"</p><p>Hermione continued rambling about the two were brothers, how the ritual was connected to both, that the venom was a component along with hummingbird feathers - Regulus let Hermione's voice wash over him, but there was a part of him, a very loud part that was screaming: <em>hogwash</em>.</p><p>But her let her speak, let her rant, and when they finally arrived at Hogwarts, after the carriages, and they went to their separate tables, the Black heir thought, <em>I need to keep an eye on this. There's something else going on.</em></p><p>Two weeks later at the end of January, after Barty delivered the venom from a friend of a friend of his father's - on the more shady side of dealings with the MLE - Regulus was proved right when Hermione waved goodbye to Barty at the end of one of their weekend study sessions in their abandoned classroom. Their Ravenclaw friend - who was almost perpetually joined at Hermione's hip - did not balk at being waved on (so Regulus was able to deduce that Hermione planned this in advance), especially since it was one of the first Saturdays that they had free for the three of them to get together after Hermione and Barty's prolonged tutoring session punishment.</p><p>Finally, when the room was empty and it was only the two of them left, Hermione turned to Regulus and looked at him, carefully, for several long moments before she asked, "Do you think you could get <em>Magick Moste Evile</em> sent to you from the library at Grimmauld?"</p><p>Immediately, both eyebrows fell into a straight line that mimicked Regulus's mouth as he stared at Hermione. His confusion and wariness of Hermione's research shifted into alarm.</p><p>"Hermione," began Regulus carefully, "Why do you need that book?"</p><p>Then, something else crossed his mind; his eyebrows shot up in concern and he voiced it. "<em>How</em> did you know the library at Grimmauld has that book?"</p><p>Hermione demurred, looking away and bringing a hand up to rub at her shoulder - the one she injured during the Diagon Alley attack. Regulus's grey eyes traced the movement, and he realized that this was her newest tell - a worrisome and absent gesture that he was sure she barely realized she was making.</p><p>"It has to do with the basilisk venom, Reg," she said instead after a few moments, giving him a tiny smile.</p><p><em>True, but not fully,</em> his mind screamed at him.</p><p>"There was a corresponding part in that book I wanted to cross-check with my original translation from the Aztec material I found…"</p><p>"That doesn't answer my question of how you knew what was in the library," said Regulus, his voice low.</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips. "Sirius told me it was there-"</p><p>"Lie," spat Regulus, something dark and dangerous growing in the pit of his stomach. He wasn't sure if it was worry, fear, or anger. "Sirius hates those books. He looked at it once and then promptly forgot about it. Deliberately. He'd never tell <em>you </em>about that book or what's in it even if he was being tortured with the <em>cruciatus</em>."</p><p>The two stared at each other for a bit longer. Finally, barely moving her mouth at all, Hermione said, "I can't tell you."</p><p>"Bullshite."</p><p>Both startled at the Muggle curse word that slipped through Regulus's mouth, wide-eyed. Regulus recovered first. "Pull the other one."</p><p>Hermione's mouth flattened. "<em>I. Can't. Tell. You</em>."</p><p>"You just don't want to," challenged Regulus instead. His inner Slytherin began to throw suggestions on how to emotionally manipulate his friend and wheedle the information from her. Another part, the one that sounded like his brother, cautioned him.</p><p>For the first time in his life, Regulus listened to that voice that sounded like Sirius.</p><p>Eventually, Hermione's face cracked. "How good is your Occlumency?"</p><p><em>Occlumency?</em> Regulus mentally blinked. <em>What in Merlin's name is Hermione involved with…?</em></p><p>He sniffed in response to her question. "It's perfect; I'm a Pureblood and a Black, Hermione. What else would you expect?"</p><p>Hermione sighed in relief, closing her eyes. "No one can crack it?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>There was something in her eyes when she stressed, "Not even Dumbledore?"</p><p>"No," replied Regulus, although it was slower, concern slowly overtaking any fear he had.</p><p>"Fine." Hermione glanced around the room, finally landing back on Regulus, and said, "Follow me."</p><p>Curious, Regulus followed Hermione as she strode briskly through the Hogwarts hallways, from their abandoned room up and down different sets of stairs and behind hidden passageways. After the first few, Regulus wanted to ask where she was taking him, but Hermione shushed him, pausing behind a tapestry on the third floor.</p><p>As he strained his ears, Regulus heard voices pass. <em>She's taking me in a roundabout where to wherever we're going to avoid being seen!</em></p><p>Admiration bled into his thoughts. <em>Clever</em>.</p><p>Then worry crept in. <em>Why doesn't she want anyone knowing I'm with her or where we're going?</em></p><p>He shot a look at the back of her curly head, wondering if maybe his Ravenclaw friend was cleverer and deadlier than he had pegged her for and if she was going to kill him or torture him. Neither would surprise him, given her interest in the Dark Arts - if that was what the book was about - but there was something strange about a Muggle-born being that deeply involved in dark magic and blood rituals.</p><p>Finally, Hermione stopped on the seventh floor, down a dusty corridor.</p><p>"Wait here," she instructed, and to his confusion, began pacing back and forth in front of a blank wall. After the third pass, a door appeared and Regulus would deny that his mouth dropped open in surprise.</p><p>"What-?"</p><p>"Wait until we're inside."</p><p>Regulus did so, following Hermione and letting himself be taken in by the sheer excess of flotsam in the large room. From the floor to ceiling, there were piles of knick-knacks and brick-a-brack, leftover pieces of furniture, broken or otherwise; trunks, mannequins, empty frames, books - the sheer number of books was staggering and Regulus salivated at the idea of sorting through them and finding some hidden treasure - and oodles of clothing and armour from forgotten eras long past.</p><p>There were tiny, narrow passages between these piles, some piles so large and high that they blocked whatever came next around it, but Hermione seemed to know where she was going, and Regulus followed her. His curiosity demanded it by this point.</p><p>But he slipped his wand from his holster, just in case, keeping it pointed at the floor instead of his friends' back.</p><p>Hermione rounded the corner of one large pile and made an "A-ha!" noise of triumph. She had stopped by a large dark oak cabinet, standing at least two heads' taller than her, and next to it was a mannequin wearing a strange, antique diamond-crusted diadem.</p><p>Hermione turned to him, her face flush was success. "I wasn't sure I would find it so quickly - it's been ages since I've been here - and I was <em>so</em> sure I'd forgotten-" she stopped, eyes dropping to Regulus's wand. The flush faded from her face and she warily looked at her friend. "Reg?"</p><p>But in the time she had begun speaking, Regulus had his eyes focused on the diadem.</p><p><em>It can't be</em>, he thought initially, staring at it. But then he took a step closer and shuddered as he felt the thick, heady ooze of dark magic seek its way toward him, its tendrils slinking forward.</p><p>Somewhere, behind his Occlumency shield, he could hear a sibilant voice purr, <em>Yes, yes, Regulus - put me on and I shall reveal all truths to you. The truth about your friend that she has been hiding since the very first day you met, and so much more…</em></p><p>Regulus swallowed thickly, tearing his eyes from the antique headpiece and shifted his wide eyes to Hermione instead. Horror stole through him as he realized what the sibilant voice was, what the diadem actually <em>was</em>.</p><p>Through a numbed mouth, fear battling with worry, he spoke. "Hermione. Hermione, <em>you didn't</em>."</p><p>Hermione stared back at Regulus. "What?"</p><p>"Hermione, tell me, Merlin above," Regulus's words were beginning to trip over themselves and he took an aborted step away from her, from the Horcrux. "Tell me you didn't split your soul-"</p><p>Thoughts rushed through his mind - <em>how do I stop her? How CAN I stop her? What did she do? Why did she do it? What spell would best work to knock her off her feet? COULD I stop her? Do I even want to - this is my friend - this is </em>Hermione<em> - just because she's made a Horcrux, does that mean I'm not her friend anymore </em>-</p><p>"What?" repeated Hermione, and then she blinked. Horror overcame her and then disgust stole across her face.</p><p>"Jesus Christ, Regulus," she snapped, slipping into Muggle blasphemy, "It's not bloody mine. It's Voldemort's."</p><p>Everything that had been racing through Regulus's mind immediately crashed to a stop when her final word penetrated his brain.</p><p>"I beg your pardon."</p><p>"Look, I know it's hard to believe-"</p><p>"That's putting it lightly-"</p><p>"Don't be a child," she snapped back, "Because right now all our emotions are heightened from this damn thing too, despite Occlumency shields-"</p><p>"<em>You</em> have Occlumency shields?" suspicion coated Regulus's voice.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "What do you want to focus on, Black? Occlumency shields or one of Voldemort's <em>freaking soul-infested Horcruxes</em>?"</p><p><em>Valid point</em>, he thought.</p><p>"How do you know this is a Horcrux-" he stopped. Blinked. His voice crept higher until it was panicked and shrill. "I'm sorry, did you just say <em>'one of</em>'?"</p><p>Hermione sighed and ran a hand through her hair, catching the brown and red-tinged curls with her fingers. She yanked her hand out and closed it into a fist. "He's… made several. This is… just one of them."</p><p>Nausea battled with fear. Regulus's suspicious nature was screaming at him, and he shifted his weight, palming his wand in his sweaty hand. "Hermione, how do you know about this? How could a <em>Muggleborn </em>know about Horcruxes? What's going on?"</p><p>Wearily, Hermione replied, "I can't tell you."</p><p>"You don't want to."</p><p>"No, I really…" she turned her head away. "I can't tell you. You wouldn't believe me."</p><p>Regulus stared at her. "Are you… are you pretending to be a Muggleborn?"</p><p>"No." There was something dead in her eyes as she replied, her voice monotone.</p><p>"How did you learn about Horcruxes?" he tried a new question.</p><p>"I read about them in a book."</p><p>He narrowed his eyes on her. "Where?"</p><p>Her mouth twitched. "In my bedroom."</p><p>His narrowed eyes resembled slits now. "... You're not lying."</p><p>"I'm not," she agreed. <em>Just remembering a time that hasn't happened yet,</em> she thought, keeping the thought tightly hidden behind her shields, of reading about Horcruxes from Dumbledore's research at Grimmauld Place.</p><p>Regulus breathed heavily through his nose, closing his eyes tightly. He brought a hand up and pinched the bridge of his nose, and then began to run a finger between his eyebrows, rubbing at the spot.</p><p>"Okay," he muttered, mostly to himself. "Okay."</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, Hermione was watching him carefully. She glanced down at his hand, his wand hand, and asked him, quietly, "Are you going to curse me?"</p><p>Regulus looked down at his wand as well, as if startled to find it was still in his hand. When he looked up, he asked, just as carefully, "Are you a risk to me?"</p><p>Hermione's eyes flashed and held his. "Never."</p><p>He swallowed and then deliberately let his wand slide back into his leather holster, a variant of an Auror-grade piece his father splurged on him for his birthday. Once it was back in his holster, both Regulus and Hermione relaxed.</p><p>"You're not going to answer me, are you?" he asked.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Regulus's eyes skipped back to the diadem. "That's Rowena Ravenclaw's, isn't it?"</p><p>"Yeah." There was something soft, sad, in her voice. "It is."</p><p>"And he… he made more?"</p><p>He could feel the weight of Hermione's eyes on him, but he refused to look at his friend.</p><p><em>I know Bellatrix is involved with this wizard - Voldemort, he calls himself. He says he supports the pureblood cause. That he'll bring back the Old Ways. But this…</em> although the diadem was something beautiful, something that had long faded into myth, Regulus wasn't stupid. He had read <em>Magick Moste Evile</em> and he knew what a Horcrux was. He knew how to make one. He knew what it did to the person who split their soul. "He's insane."</p><p>Hermione was slower in replying. "To some degree, yes. It'll get worse over time. But right now? He's still fairly powerful. And he's clever."</p><p>"They want me," he finally admitted, glancing at her. "They knew Sirius would never say yes. And they already have Bella - and I think Cissa is involved, too-"</p><p>"I know, Reg."</p><p>He closed his eyes. "I-" he stuttered, choking on the words. "I- I don't- I don't want to-"</p><p>A small, delicate, cold hand reached out and touched his. He caught Hermione's and clenched it tightly, squeezing to the point of pain but allowed her to ground him.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he turned partially to look at her but did not drop her hand. Something tightened in his chest, shortly, and then eased as he said, "What do you need from me? What do you need me to do?"</p><p>And when she smiled at him, it something sad - but it lifted his heart all the same.</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC...</p>

  <strong>December 1976</strong>
</p><p>"DERANGED WIZARDS ATTACK YULE SHOPPERS IN DIAGON ALLEY," the headline screamed on the following days' <em>Daily Prophet</em>.</p><p>James couldn't stop staring at it, couldn't stop staring at the accompanying image that was blown up to cover the entire front fold. Despite being in black and white, James would wince at the beginning of each playback loop, from the final explosion of debris being catapulted through the air, the focus on the mad, cackling female form and the hooded men being blown back, and the single emphasis of the puddle of blood, darkly stark against the white snowbank.</p><p>He could feel the lingering anxiety and adrenaline from the event rush through his veins and lungs, and James clenched his hands tightly into fists as he sat at the breakfast table, eyes fixated on his father's paper despite the older man rustling it and clearing his throat, ignoring his toast in favour of whatever section he was reading.</p><p><em>How can you be so calm about this?</em> thought James, lifting his eyes from the headline to look at his father, seeing only his hazel eyes as they swept back and forth across the text he was reading, and his more salt-than-pepper hair. Sitting at his father's right, Dorea was focused on stirring her honey into her tea with poise.</p><p>Both his parents seemed remarkably calm that morning. Swallowing thickly, James looked down at his clenched hands and slowly unfurl them, watching as they shook with minor trembles. They had been so close to the <em>Avada Kedavra</em> - they could've died if it weren't for Hermione - James nearly <em>died</em> watching her leap out of the blasted window - her duel with the other woman, getting flung back -</p><p>"James, darling, pass the butter please."</p><p>James' head shot up to stare at his mother.</p><p>Dorea's grey eyes focused on her son, waiting for his acknowledgment, and when it failed, she said again, a bit stronger, "James. The butter, please."</p><p>With a shaking hand, James reached out and slid the butter tray toward his mother, who watched him with a carefully neutral expression on her face. Her son kept his face down, facing the table. Clearing her throat, she caught her husband's attention, causing Charlus to lower the paper briefly and catch his wife's eyes.</p><p>She then flicked hers toward their son, and Charlus gave a small, inaudible sigh as he folded the paper and placed it to the side.</p><p>"James."</p><p>James' head snapped up, and Charlus briefly winced at the look in his son's eyes. His heart ached for the raw pain that was etched on James' face - from a sleepless night, if the bruises under his glasses were any indication - but also by the lowered pull to his mouth in worry.</p><p>Charlus reached forward and placed his hand on James' shoulder. "Son, it's alright to be scared. But it's over now. This is the drain from everything. You'll be fine in a few days."</p><p>James looked down at his lap, clenching his hands in his lap. "You're right, I'm sure you're right - but I - I can't help but <em>remember</em> - see it all in my mind every time I close my eyes-"</p><p>"Darling," breathed Dorea, leaning across the table toward her son, her eyes shining. "We're here. We're fine."</p><p>"But you <em>weren't</em>!" protested James, the words bursting from him quickly. He blinked rapidly, glancing away. He whispered, "I saw the spell, too. I saw it."</p><p>Dorea and Charlus exchanged another glance. "Spell?" asked Charlus carefully, his hand a warm, comforting weight on James.</p><p>"The Killing Curse," breathed James, his voice so low and quiet both adults had to strain to hear him, even in the silence of their dining room. "If it weren't for Hermione - if she hadn't thrown up the table to protect you-"</p><p>Both his parents were silent as they waited for James to process and work through his own emotions of the skirmish the other day.</p><p>"Hermione - I always knew she was powerful. She did things this past year that I couldn't ignore. But… but seeing her fight like that?" he shook his head. "I - I used to think that battles would be something glorious to be involved in. That being an Auror would be the best, hunting down and fighting Dark Wizards."</p><p>"Oh, James," sighed Charlus, the hand spasming a bit on his shoulder. "I would've told you the truth if you had asked about the Aurors. But it isn't like that. It never was, and I doubt it ever will be."</p><p>"But you talk about your time with them with… with all these fond memories," argued James, peeking over the edge of the rim of his glasses at his father.</p><p>Charlus snorted. "To entertain a seven-year-old wizard who dreams of being a Gryffindor and saving the day. They were <em>stories</em>, James. Reality is never like what we imagine it to be."</p><p>"I fear we're straying from the point now," interrupted Dorea, her voice low. "The truth is, you're right to be scared, James. We were seconds away from dying when Miss Evan's transfiguration saved us."</p><p><em>I don't think that was transfiguration,</em> thought James, his mental voice small and worrisome in his mind. <em>What </em>I <em>do is transfiguration, and that dome remained in form even after the spells hit. It was permanent.</em></p><p>"We owe her a Life Debt," continued Charlus, and James squished his lips together to keep a hysterical laugh in. Hermione was just racking up the Life Debts now, especially after the Shrieking Shack incident last year. Between her and James, they would have a direct debt of help from both elder Potters and Snape to save their lives, and aid from Crouch.</p><p>"I would like to know more about her, James," continued Dorea, her voice a touch on the imperious side. "You never mentioned her before, when… when speaking about your fellow Gryffindors. That such a remarkable girl is the sister of one - well! You'd think she would stand out more at Hogwarts."</p><p>"She hates the attention," muttered James. "It's why she's only friends with Crouch and Regulus. I think most of her house dislikes her, actually. I've never seen anyone - from any year - really interact with her other than Crouch."</p><p>Charlus frowned. "They don't bully her, do they?"</p><p>"Not that I saw," he replied quickly, thinking back but his memories of Hermione sadly only began when Professor Pythas cornered him and told him to attend tutoring sessions to improve his grades for his OWL.</p><p><em>Why did I only notice her </em>now<em>? </em>he wondered, his mouth pulling further down. Hermione was - not fun, she was a bit too bossy and intimidating for that, but she was wicked smart, and sharp, and dangerous in a way that made James' breath quicken and his palms sweaty and his heartbeat thunder in his chest. It was like all his senses were heightened and when she walked into a room he was in, he could pinpoint her like he had a permanent tracking charm on her, attuned only to him.</p><p>"She wasn't scared," said James, breaking into the silence that fell after he last spoke; his parents were still wrapped in their own thoughts regarding the young Ravenclaw. "Hermione. She was on the window ledge and then out on the street, fighting against - against that witch-"</p><p>"Yes. <em>Her</em>," Dorea's mouth pinched into a tight, unpleasant line, and James found himself wondering if his mother knew who the cloaked woman was, just like Hermione. But with Hermione, the fight had seemed <em>personal</em>.</p><p>"She was very impressive," said Charlus, slowly, causing James to look at him. "She could certainly hold her own, and she moved as she had fought before."</p><p>"Was that why you were asking if she was bullied? You think she's had to defend herself before?" asked James, horrified.</p><p>Charlus did not reply, but James found himself thinking that was likely and resolved to keep an eye on Hermione when he returned to Hogwarts in January. Perhaps his pranks should've been aimed at the Ravenclaws as well, and not just the Slytherins…</p><p>"But, darling," interrupted Dorea, pulling James' attention to her next. "You do realize that it's not your job to fight, do you?"</p><p>"Mum, I-"</p><p>"James. We're your parents. <em>We</em> protect <em>you</em>. Not the other way around," his mother added, firmly. Her Black eyes - the same grey-silver that she shared with her family - bore into James. "I didn't want you going out there to fight. I didn't want <em>Miss Evans</em> to go out there and fight. You're children."</p><p>"But - but I did go out. With Dad," stuttered James, looking between his parents with wide eyes.</p><p>"You did, James," agreed Charlus readily, nodding. "And we did well together. But it would've been just as fine had you stayed safe in the cafe. It would be one less thing for me to think or worry about when fighting."</p><p>Heat filled James, but he was unsure if it was from anger or shame. He fought well! He helped defend Diagon Alley! But then, he'd remember how frightened he was, at how loud everything had been and the smell of ozone as the amount of magic during Hermione's attack on the witch and wizard had made the show around her melt, wavering in the air…</p><p>"I - I think - I've lost my appetite," mumbled James, his stomach rolling at the memory. "May I please be excused?"</p><p>"Of course, darling," murmured Dorea in reply.</p><p>James did not look at his parents as he pushed back his chair and stood, quickly walking from the room until he was outside. He leaned against the cool wall and let his head tilt back until it rested against the panel, breathing deeply through his nose.</p><p>The door to the dining room had been left open a crack - he hadn't closed it fully when he left - and his parents' soft voices filtered through to him.</p><p>"-I'll contact a few friends I still have in the Aurors," Charlus was saying. "I'll ask them to discreetly forget that an underaged girl was fighting in the Alley yesterday. To protect her."</p><p>"A good idea. She doesn't need the attention, nor do I think she'd like it," agreed Dorea, just as quietly. Thoughtfully. "And - well, if I know my niece, I do not think she would do that alone. She likes chaos, but this was still too organized for her."</p><p>Charlus sighed. "This won't stop any rumours. There were too many eyewitnesses, of course, but we can contain this somewhat and keep her safe."</p><p>"For now."</p><p>"Yes, for now."</p><p>There was some silence, and James held his breath, tilting his head just slightly toward the door as his ears strained to hear more.</p><p>"I think we should learn more about her," his mother finally said, very quietly - so quietly James barely heard her.</p><p>"I agree," replied Charlus, his own voice a low rumble. "She's ridiculously powerful for a fifteen-year-old witch."</p><p>"And intelligent. <em>Too</em> intelligent," agreed Dorea.</p><p>"She seems nice, though," sighed Charlus, with a rustling noise that James assumed was his paper as he picked it up again.</p><p>Dorea's voice was grim when she spoke. "So did Tom."</p><p><em>Tom? Who is that?</em> wondered James, frowning. But he moved away from the door, quietly, taking all his stealth lessons from pranking at Hogwarts until he was in his own bedroom, lying on his bed and staring at his ceiling.</p><p>"She's not a threat," he muttered, arms crossed and his palms cupping the back of his head as he relaxed. "She's not. I trust her."</p><p><em>But that doesn't mean I'm not going to keep a better eye on her this term,</em> he promised himself.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>January 1977</strong>
</p><p>"Everyone's talking about it," muttered Sirius, his grey eyes flickering back and forth as he walked with James. King's Cross station - the magical side - was filled was families as they said goodbye to their children and friends, but there was an undercurrent of tension in some people that felt off; some were far more aware of what occurred in Diagon Alley, while others just enjoyed the gossip.</p><p>The eldest Black had met up with James the moment Dorea Apparated him to the station, saying a quick goodbye and leaving James to get on the train with Sirius. Although Sirius was supposed to stay with them over the holidays, the attack on Diagon Alley meant he stayed with Regulus until it was over and then took him back home to Grimmauld Place; from there, he didn't have an opportunity to leave for the rest of the holiday period, and it was apparent with his slightly manic personality and the rough edginess in his behaviour and gestures.</p><p>"Not everyone," muttered James, glancing at a giggling pair of Gryffindors who were eyeing him and then giggled to one another, whispering from behind their hands.</p><p>"Forget them," muttered Sirius, wrapping an arm around his friend's shoulders and bumping against him. He shot the girls a look and then directed James away, toward the train. "'Sides, I thought you were interested in the wee Evans?"</p><p>James glanced around. "You know I am."</p><p>"Then why would it bother you if other girls are looking at you? You never strayed when you were interested in Lily," commented Sirius, raising his eyebrows as they both climbed the steps to the train compartment. "Given how you feel, I doubt you'd even have the tiniest <em>inkling</em> of a thought for someone else when you're actively pursuing Evans."</p><p>"I'm not… exactly pursuing her," winced James, running a hand through his hair as he sighed, feet automatically taking him to his usual compartment. He opened the door, sliding it to reveal Remus and Peter already seated.</p><p>Remus glanced between James and Sirius, blinking, while Peter asked, "Pursuing who? Surely not Lily, anymore?"</p><p>James sighed, again. "No, not Lily. I think it's safe to say that <em>that</em> spell has been cast."</p><p>"Oh, so this is about her sister?" continued Peter, as James sat heavily in the seat opposite him, next to Remus while Sirius sat next to Peter, sprawling and taking up as much space as he could. He tossed one leg over Peter's, causing the other teen to shoot him a nasty glare.</p><p>"Have you elevated Hermione to Lily's old position then?" asked a wry Remus, propping an elbow on the compartment window's lip, and using that to lean his cheek against his hand. "Should we expect some creative spell work from the Ravenclaw after you've enchanted her dishware to serenade her? Will she scream and shout at you when you prank Crouch or Black?"</p><p>James slunk in his seat as Remus threw his previous methodology in getting Lily's attention in his face. His shoulders curled in and he muttered, "No."</p><p>"Will you chase her down between classes and try to give her flowers?" asked Peter, a teasing glint in his eyes as he leaned forward and continued Remus' line of questioning. "You can't sit next to her in class or dazzle her as a defense partner since you're in different years."</p><p>"I - no, I won't do that-" protested James weakly. Suddenly hearing what he used to do to win Lily's attention was embarrassing.</p><p>Sirius nodded, wisely saying, "So you're going to just stare at her from the Gryffindor table with a dopey, lovesick look on your face and sigh whenever she does something fetching?"</p><p>"I-" James looked around the compartment and the amused looks on his friends' faces and felt the blood rush to his cheeks. "Can you change the subject, please?"</p><p>Remus, the most sympathetic, gallantly did so. "Were you in Diagon Alley the day of the attack? I remember you mentioned plans during one of our letters…"</p><p>James groaned, slouching further in his seat.</p><p>Bewildered, Remus and Peter exchanged glances as Sirius snickered. Peter asked, "What's Prongs' problem?"</p><p>"Oh, we were both there when the attack happened," replied Sirius, shooting a bit of a smirk at James, who slipped further down the seat until he was nearly horizontal, his butt hanging off the edge. "He's just pissed 'cause those nutters interrupted his date-"</p><p>"Date?!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"<em>Padfoot</em>," whined James, closing his eyes and wishing the floor would swallow him. <em>Maybe I can dig out my invisibility cloak?</em> The idea sounded well, and James decided to shelve it for future embarrassments.</p><p>"What date was this?" asked Remus, leaning forward so that he was looking down at James, hovering above him. "Did you go on a date with Hermione?"</p><p>"It wasn't exactly like that," muttered James.</p><p>"It kind of was exactly like that," rejoined Sirius, a wicked glint in his eyes.</p><p>Peter's head bounced between Sirius and James when he asked, eagerly, "Well? What happened? Did you get together?"</p><p>James sat up, forcing Remus back and scowled at his friends, all of who were watching him. "Since when do you lot care so much for my love life, huh? Why aren't we asking Padfoot about his dates? Or you, Moony? Wormtail?"</p><p>"I'm not interested in anyone right now," shrugged Peter.</p><p>Remus took his free hand and pointed it at himself, saying in a self-deprecating voice, "Werewolf."</p><p>And Sirius just shrugged.</p><p>"Ugh," replied James, crossing his arms.</p><p>"Anyway," continued Sirius, "Jimmy and the wee Evans ended up together after Reg and I went for lunch."</p><p>"The two of you were together when the attack happened?" asked an alarmed Remus. "Where were you? Were you alright?"</p><p>"First of all," began James, annoyed, "It wasn't a date. We went shopping for Yule presents, talked about her sister-" at the others' looks, James elaborated, "the <em>muggle</em> one, Petunia. <em>And then</em> we met with my parents and were having lunch-"</p><p>"She <em>met</em> your <em>parents</em>?" squeaked Peter, eyes wide.</p><p>James stuttered, "I - what? Yes?"</p><p>"Merlin," breathed Peter, exhaling loudly and sitting back in the cushions. He shook his head. "On the first date, too."</p><p>"It wasn't a date!" protested James. "And besides, nothing happened before the window blew in-"</p><p>"<em>The window blew in?"</em> repeated Remus, mouth dropping open. "You didn't say that in your letters!"</p><p>Even Sirius was frowning, staring hard at James as the Potter began to squirm in his seat. "Well, I…"</p><p>"What happened, Prongs?"</p><p>"Yeah Prongs," added Sirius, something tight in his voice as his eyes bore into his best friend. "What happened?"</p><p>"Nothing," said James after a moment. He looked at his friends equally and emphatically added, "Nothing. The window blew in, some people were attacking the Alley, and my parents stepped in and Apparated us to Hermione's house to get her home."</p><p>Remus and Peter seemed to have bought the explanation, but Sirius's narrowed eyes made James mentally wince - for a moment, he forgot that Hermione was friends with his little brother, who he was beginning to mend fences with.</p><p>In the meantime, Remus brought up their final semester course material for NEWT prep, drawing Peter into a conversation, which James did his best to add to. The Hogwarts Express began to move, and soon the Marauders ended up speaking about their final project: the Marauder's Map and its completion.</p><p>The trip back to Hogwarts passed uneventfully, and James forgot all about Sirius's earlier attitude until they stepped off the train and walked toward the horseless carriages.</p><p>Remus and Peter were ahead, Remus shuffling the younger students where they needed to as Prefect; it was then that Sirius drew James away from much of the crowd, toward the back of the line for the carriages until they were at the end of the train station platform, surrounded by piles of luggage being unloaded by sightless house elves.</p><p>"Sirius?" asked James, blinking at his friend.</p><p>Sirius himself stood still, a frown on his handsome face as he surveyed his best friend - his brother - for a few long moments. Then, he spoke.</p><p>"You lied," said Sirius, his voice low.</p><p>"I'm sorry?"</p><p>Sirius's grey eyes were more steel as they darkened. "More happened at Diagon Alley. You lied to us. To Moony, Wormtail. <em>To me</em>."</p><p>James swallowed thickly. "How - how did you know?"</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. "Evans sent Reggie a letter. Mentioned she got hurt in the attack and your mum was nice enough to heal her."</p><p>James was instantly thrown back to the moment of the attack: of Hermione being hit and sent skidding back, tumbling to the cobblestones before rolling swiftly to her feet and flinging a spell back-</p><p>"<em>-mes</em>? James?!"</p><p>Sirius had his hands on James' shoulders and was shaking him. As things came back into focus, James kept his eyes on his friend, taking in Sirius's worried look.</p><p>"I'm okay," he replied automatically. "Sorry."</p><p>"You scared me," muttered Sirius, eyes flicking searchingly all over James' face. "Where did you go? What happened that day?"</p><p>James glanced away. "Hermione did get hurt. It - it wasn't <em>terrible,</em> but it wasn't… it wasn't anything good, either. She fought, and I helped her. So did mum and dad, until the wizards and witch left. Then the Aurors appeared, but dad Apparated us away. That's… that's all, Padfoot."</p><p>Sirius was still searching James for any more lies, but slowly, he nodded, accepting the excuse and explanation the Potter gave. Just as slowly, he said, "Alright. Alright, then."</p><p>They climbed into one of the last carriages before it meandered down the line to stragglers, but the ride was silent.</p><p>James, still caught up in what he witnessed and participated in over the holidays, found himself reliving those horrible memories and still felt as inadequate as he had when he tried to help Hermione; whatever his father said, yes, he handled himself well but compared to her? And what if those wizards and witch came back? Tried to attack again, or - Merlin forbid - realized who Hermione was and attacked <em>her</em>?</p><p>The thoughts lingered with James all throughout the returning feast for January, and even for the following weeks as he began to pile more homework and readings in preparation for his NEWTs. He continued to meet Hermione in the library - in their corner in the Arithmancy section - every Friday.</p><p>But something had changed within him. There was a bit of a paler quality to his skin, and he threw himself into his schoolwork with a gusto he only had previously done for pranks. Remus was deliriously happy, and Sirius was deliriously annoyed. Peter oscillated between both, as he benefited from James' tutelage and Sirius' attention when James was busy.</p><p>The only time the four came together in the evenings was to continue to work on their map, applying the finishing touches and spell work.</p><p>"Just think of all the pranks we will be able to accomplish with this!" whispered an excited Sirius one evening near the end of January, a pleased glint in his light eyes.</p><p>"Just think of all the books I can take out and continue to read," countered Remus.</p><p>Peter added, "Or all the snacks we can sneak back from the kitchen!"</p><p>Waiting for James to add his two knuts, the three looked at him, but he only looked back, a bit like a startled stag in the face of a car's bright headlights.</p><p>"Prongs?" prompted Sirius, an intense look on his face.</p><p>"Just think of all the hiding spots we can find and use!" he finally said, though his tone was forced.</p><p>The other three were not convinced but said nothing. All turned back to the parchment as Remus cast the final spell and watched as inky black lines spilled forced and crisscrossed and zigzagged their way all over the large parchment, turning empty spaces into boxy squares or large rectangles, or even angular corners. Then, fading into view, were footmarks with a tiny banner indicating that person's name.</p><p>"Merlin!" breathed Sirius, excitedly. "We can see where <em>everyone </em>is!"</p><p>"Is that Dumbledore, pacing in his office?" asked an excited Peter, pointing at one corner of the parchment.</p><p>"It is!" replied Remus, mouth open and delight in his face.</p><p>But James skimmed over and over until reaching the Ravenclaw tower and easily picked out Hermione's name hovering in a single spot - probably her room. And, in the privacy of his mind, he added what he wanted to say but dared not in front of his friends: <em>Just think of how I can now keep an eye on Hermione Evans</em>.</p><hr /><p>Like he promised to himself, James kept an eye on Hermione. There was something different about her as if she was carrying a heavy weight. He noticed, and he was sure that both Crouch and Regulus knew it too, with the way they watched her sometimes (but not the way he did).</p><p>When he used to watch Lily, he would do whatever he could to draw her attention. To make her <em>look</em> at him, to see he was more than a braggart and snob. He knew that Lily sometimes found it creepy, that he would borderline stalk her - but he didn't with Hermione.</p><p>Instead, when in the Great Hall for breakfast or lunch, he made sure he was facing the Ravenclaw table (which meant changing seats with Pete) and sitting next to Remus for the first week of school, which put Sirius out. But it gave him the opportunity to watch her without making it too obvious.</p><p>(That kind of failed - all his friend knew who he was looking at, but politely didn't say anything since his attraction and crush on Hermione was incredibly different from what he previously did with Lily.)</p><p>But he was able to learn more about her, which was what he wanted to do from the beginning - even when they had still been in the "friends" category. And each little thing he learned, he put in a mental box labelled 'Hermione,' ready to pull that information out at any time, if it was necessary.</p><p>In February, as he walked by them in the hallway outside the Great Hall, he overheard them making Hogsmeade plans. When Hermione demurred, saying she wasn't going, both boys immediately agreed to stay with her, despite Crouch having just been moaning about a lack of chocolate and Regulus mentioning plans to meet up with a girl he was interested in. James noted it: Crouch and Regulus deferred to Hermione.</p><p>In March, a Gryffindor Quidditch practice was scheduled for late Friday evening, running a bare thirty minutes after James and Hermione normally finished their tutoring session. Of course, James took advantage of their time together and often remained with her in the library for a few hours after, but this time, Sirius, Remus, and Peter arrived to drag him out - he was captain after all!</p><p>James had turned to Hermione, asking, "Are you going to watch the practice?"</p><p>Hermione had frowned, shaking her head. "I - I don't go to matches."</p><p>"Why not?" Peter had asked.</p><p>"No reason," the Ravenclaw had replied, but there had been something cagey in her tone that James had heard. She had also turned away from his friends, keeping her eyes downward and shoulders curled in, facing James despite Peter speaking.</p><p>Instead of pressuring her (which he would've done with Lily), James had reached out and touched her shoulder. "That's fine," he had said instead, smiling winningly at her, flashing bright teeth. "Why don't we walk you out, though? And halfway back to the Ravenclaw tower?"</p><p>She had seemed to not know what to say to stop them, so she had gathered her books. James had kept in step with her, but as soon as they were out of the slightly busy library, into the empty halls, Hermione had moved so that she was on the outside of the group, on James' side. James had been puzzled until he realized: she was actively avoiding being near Peter and Remus. She had kept her eyes forward or away from the side they were on (on Sirius's other side, who was nearly attached at James' hip), and although she had answered questions Remus asked of her, Hermione had kept her replies short and pointed.</p><p>In April, he noticed that something happened between her and Regulus. Crouch seemed ambivalent to whatever was going on (or, rather, he knew what Hermione was up to while Regulus didn't, and didn't care, which James thought was more likely), but whatever happened between Regulus and Hermione seemed to have spooked the Slytherin, because he appeared at breakfast on Monday morning paler than usual, and less put together than normal; enough so that Sirius made a tiny noise upon seeing him.</p><p>And, in May, from his seat at the Gryffindor table one afternoon, he watched with morbid fascination as Hermione had reached the doors to the Great Hall to leave at the same time that Lily arrived. The two sisters paused where they stood: Lily with her friends from Gryffindor on the outside of the hall, with Hermione on the inside and with Crouch at her elbow.</p><p>Both had remained silent for a long moment before Marlene had muttered something and Lily was forced to move. But James watched as Hermione strode forward, purposefully with Crouch, with Lily mimicking her… until the very last moment when the redhead Gryffindor turned back and craned her neck to watch Hermione disappear. And when Lily had sat down at her usual spot at the table, James could see that she seemed despondent, despite the animated expressions and laughter of her friends around her.</p><p>As if she had sensed him, Lily had looked up and caught James' eyes. Marlene had also noticed, and called loudly, "Alright, Potter?" at him. In response, he had slid his hazel eyes toward Marlene, nodding at both her and then Lily before excusing himself and leaving the Great Hall as well.</p><p>(And, as much as he could, he tried to ignore what he overheard as he left: Marlene asking Lily, "What's going on with him? I thought he fancied you," and Lily's reply, a bit short and terse, "No, not anymore - thank <em>Merlin</em>.")</p><p>It wasn't until the end of the semester, in June, when one evening after the others in his dormitory went to sleep, that James snuck the Marauder's Map from Sirius' bag and crept back into his bed, drawing the curtains around for privacy.</p><p>With his wand in one hand and the map in the other, he whispered, "I solemnly swear I'm up to no good."</p><p>Inky lines grew from the center of the folded paper, and with bated breath, James' eyes began to search for Hermione's name on the map, beginning with the Ravenclaw tower.</p><p>She wasn't there.</p><p>James blinked in surprise and then frowned. <em>Where is she?</em></p><p>He began to flip through the numerous edges and folds of the map, growing more frantic as he did so, unable to locate Hermione. Suddenly, his heart clenched in fear. <em>Hogwarts is supposed to be one of the safest places in the wizarding world - but what if those dark wizards managed to get in? What if they figured out who Hermione was that day?</em></p><p>Sucking in a harried breath, James' flipping took on sudden haste, to the point that he tore a tiny edge of the new map, wincing as he did so.</p><p>And then he spotted her, on the fourth floor, along with Crouch. They were moving somewhere, toward the stairs and then up another flight. With a frown, he watched as their feet - representing them on the map - moved down the hallway and toward a different wing than where they began, and toward another set of stairs closer to the Gryffindor tower.</p><p><em>I know she doesn't fancy Crouch,</em> thought James, tucking his wand between his teeth as he reached for a discarded sweater in Gryffindor red and his invisibility cloak.</p><p>Stealthily, he slipped between his curtains, glancing at Remus and Peter's closed ones and Sirius's drawn curtains; no movement came from Remus's bedside - he was a heavy sleeper - and Peter was snoring loudly. Sirius was curled tight into a ball in the middle of his bed with the covers pulled over his head and not moving.</p><p>James tiptoes past Sirius's bed, toward the door, and inched it open, flickering light from a single wall sconce spilling into the dark boy's dormitory and lighting on James' empty bed. He held his breath, but no one stirred, so he slipped through the gap and soundlessly closed the door behind him.</p><p>The Common Room was empty as well, with a slight orange tinge to it from the fading embers of a dying fire in the fireplace. There was a stillness to the room, an air of anticipation, and James ate it up as he slipped the invisibility cloak over his head and pushed the frame open.</p><p>The portrait snorted, blinking awake blearily as the Fat Lady demanded, "W-What? W-Who's there?" only to mumble a bit more and then fall back to sleep, snoring lightly as her double chins rested on her ample bosom.</p><p>No one stopped James as he meandered down the hallways, sticking close to the shadows despite having his invisibility cloak on. He kept one eye on the Map as he watched where Hermione and Crouch were going, and one eye on his surroundings in case there were any patrols.</p><p>Hermione and Crouch didn't seem to care that they were out after curfew. In fact, they had all the appearance of taking a Sunday stroll by the time James caught up with them on the seventh floor. Both were walking in the middle of the hall, side by side, not bothering to lower their voices or disillusion themselves from the portraits.</p><p>"-aren't we using our usual room?" asked Crouch, a tiny whine in his voice as he shoved his hands deep into his trouser pockets. He was still wearing his day clothes but went <em>sans</em> robe.</p><p>"I wanted to show you something different," replied Hermione evenly, glancing up at her friend.</p><p>James was careful to stay downwind of Crouch, closer to Hermione's side than his as he inched up behind them until he was only a few meters away.</p><p>"Different?" Crouch seemed to perk up at the word.</p><p>"Do you trust me?" Hermione asked in response, stopping by a blank space of wall opposite a portrait of dancing trolls. Her eyes were wide and imploring as she peered up at her friend who towered over her by a good foot and a half.</p><p>Crouch solemnly stared down at Hermione for a long moment, before a corner of his mouth twitched. "More than I think even you know."</p><p>Hermione's brows furrowed in puzzlement, but she took the cryptic words in stride. "Don't move," she instructed, and then began walking back and forth in front of the blank wall, three times.</p><p><em>What is she-</em> James' thought cut off and he froze, squashing the desire to gasp as a door appeared on the blank wall; at the same time, Crouch let out a tiny yelp of surprise, stumbling a bit back.</p><p>"Well, don't just stand there like a numpty," chided Hermione with a grin. "Come on in!"</p><p>Crouch didn't hesitate, launching himself forward just as Hermione yanked open the door. They two stepped through and James hurried after them, slipping in not a moment too soon as the door shut behind him.</p><p>Crouch whistled long and loud, his hands on his hips and his head tilted back as he took in the space. "What is this place?"</p><p>James had the same question. He had never heard of a room with an appearing door, and he and his friends had mapped the entire school.</p><p>The room itself was large and grand, like a dueling room. The floor was slick marble and the walls the same kind of stone that made up Hogwarts, but there were towering, thick columns in grey that spiralled up into a high, receding ceiling and wooden cross beams cutting between the columns and along the sides of the room. There were no windows, and the angled ceiling created a Cathedral-like feeling of silence and awe.</p><p>James hesitated to move, sure that his steps would be heard; instead, he waited until the two were speaking again and mutter <em>silencio</em> on his shoes - which belatedly, he realized he should've done earlier - and then settled himself against one of the columns to watch.</p><p>"Welcome to the Room of Requirements," began Hermione, grandly gesturing with one hand.</p><p>"Room of Requirements? Does that mean - anything I require, it will provide?" asked Crouch curiously.</p><p>Hermione nodded. "For the most part. The limit really is your imagination in here."</p><p>"How did you find - never mind." Crouch quickly changed topics, shaking his head. "So what are we doing in here then?"</p><p>"We're going to practice your spell casting," said Hermione, walking further away from where James stood, more toward the center of the large rectangular room. She left Crouch standing where he was, arms crossed.</p><p>Crouch scowled. "We could've done that in our usual practice room!"</p><p>"But this time you're going on the offensive, Barty!" called Hermione, a wide grin on her face. "You've been doing great with your nonverbal casting - but let's put it to the test!"</p><p>"<em>Why</em>?" he groaned, but gamely did as Hermione instructed and withdrew his wand. He settled into a slightly flourished dueler's position. "D'you want to conjure some practice dummies for me, or what?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head, turning her body sideways as she spoke. "You're going to fight me."</p><p>Crouch immediately dropped the position, standing up straight and staring hard at his best friend, while James found himself inching forward, his wand in his own hand.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Barty-"</p><p>"Hermione, <em>no</em>. If there is one person in this Merlin-forsaken place that I <em>won't</em> ever fight, it's you." There was something hard and dark in Crouch's eyes as James drew level with him, but still far enough away that hopefully, the partially infected wizard wouldn't notice him.</p><p>Something softened in Hermione as she stared back. "You need to learn this, Barty."</p><p>"I do not!" the reply was snapped back quickly, an underlying quiver in Crouch's tone as he spoke.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath. "I'm sorry to say that you do. Things are changing-"</p><p>"Is this about Diagon Alley?" he broke in, a heavy frown on his face. "The Aurors will take care of them, you know, the wizards and witch that attacked-"</p><p>"It doesn't really-" Hermione stopped and bit her lip, looking skyward for a moment. "Okay, so it <em>does</em> have something to do with that. But you should also know how to use your magic defensively-"</p><p>"I don't <em>want</em> to know how to use my magic defensively, and certainly not against my best friend-"</p><p>Hermione stomped her foot and a wordless noise of frustration emerged from her at the same - as did a small tremble in the marble flooring as it cracked where her stomped foot came down, creating a small pocket of dented stone. A few webbed lines split from the circle toward Crouch.</p><p>James' mouth dropped open.</p><p>Crouch was staring at her. "Did you just-?"</p><p>Hermione was staring at the floor as well, where her left foot was significantly lower than the right. "I think I did."</p><p>"Have you lost control like that before?" he asked, and James swivelled his head toward the tall, brown-haired Ravenclaw.</p><p><em>Lost control? Before? Hermione's done accidental magic like this? But - she's so in </em>control, he thought in confusion.</p><p>"During the attack," the witch replied softly, nodding slowly, "In Diagon Alley. My magic responded with me realizing it when I saved-"</p><p><em>Saved my parents,</em> James finished the words in his head, even though Hermione clamped her mouth shut tight.</p><p>"You're sure you didn't say a spell?" pressed Crouch, moving a few steps closer. There was worry in her tone and it was all over his face as he stared at his friend. "You didn't cast anything, it was just - the transmutation?"</p><p>James' brows furrowed. <em>Transmutation? Like… alchemy?</em></p><p>Hermione was staring down at her hands. "Even since I cracked it, it's getting easier to wield. Instinctual. It's getting harder to remember to cast a spell with my wand when - when things are just…"</p><p>Crouch made a noise, low in his throat. "Hermione-"</p><p>She looked up then, something hard in her eyes. "That's why I want you to fight me, Barty. Yeah, you need to practice anyway, but I also need to be able to use my wand to fight back. I can't trust transmutation. Not yet."</p><p>Crouch was silent for a long, long time before he sighed, long and deep. "Okay. Alright."</p><p>The smile Hermione sent Crouch made James' breath hitch.</p><p>"Come at me," teased Crouch, falling into a traditional dueler's position, facing sideways with one arm extended behind for balance and his wand hand elevated above his head.</p><p>Hermione stared for a long moment and then went, "No, no, you're doing it wrong," moving forward and readjusting Crouch's form, nudging his arm and body with firm hands.</p><p>It was enough that James felt jealousy begin to settle low in his stomach as he watched the girl he liked manipulate her best friend's body until Crouch was standing in a completely different form.</p><p>"Sideways is good, presents a smaller target, but why in God's name would you have your wand out like that? A well-aimed <em>expelliarmus</em> would leave you wandless!"</p><p>Crouch smiled down at his friend in fondness until he asked, "Is this better?"</p><p>Hermione nodded firmly. "Yes. Okay. Now, remember, nonverbal casting only! I'll block and be on the defense."</p><p>Crouch nodded and James watched as they kept a good twenty meters from one another in the large room, both watching the other for long, terse moments-</p><p>James startled when Crouch flew into a flurry of multi-coloured spells, each aimed at his friend. The riotous colours of red, green, blue and even white made James' breath catch and his hand gripped his wand tightly in response, wanting to leap forward and cast a shield - Hermione still hadn't moved -</p><p><em>Hermione!</em> He shouted in his mind.</p><p>And then she twisted her ankle, just so, pivoting in her spot. Below her pivoted toe, something gold appeared, and James squinted, trying to focus on it -</p><p>A circle blew outward from her foot, several connected circles and lines between the transmutation equation. The glowing golden lines sparked and hissed as electricity raced along the markings within the circles and then shot up in a semicircle around Hermione, creating a glowing, golden shield of pure light.</p><p>Crouch's spells bounced harmlessly off it, pinging loudly and then ricocheting to different directions. The red spell hit one of the columns and tore a chunk of heavy rock from it.</p><p>Crouch lowered his wand. "That wasn't a <em>protego</em>."</p><p>"<em>That</em> was what I meant by instinctual," sighed Hermione in response, bringing a hand up to rub at her collarbone. "I'm barely moving, barely thinking of what I need and then - <em>bam</em>! My knowledge of transmutation takes over and I'm manipulating everything around me.</p><p>"What did you do?" asked Crouch.</p><p>Hermione frowned. "I - I think I transmuted the air."</p><p>James froze.</p><p>"I'm sorry," said Crouch, his incredulous tone matching James's own feelings. "Did you just say that you think you transmuted the <em>air</em>?"</p><p><em>Holy Merlin,</em> thought James, staring at Hermione in a new light. She didn't need his help in a fight; she had already shown she could handle herself, but now <em>knowing</em> just far advanced her magic was…!</p><p>He frowned, feeling slightly inadequate, only to then shame himself. It wasn't a competition of who was magically stronger - after all, Crouch and Regulus clearly were not in the same league as Hermione, either - but after what happened in Diagon Alley, James never wanted to feel as outclassed as he did, with Hermione handling much of the fight. His rock troll only distracted the wizards until his father's magic added to it, stabilizing his transfiguration.</p><p><em>I need to improve,</em> thought James, slowly inching away as the two continued to speak about Hermione's thoughts on her abilities. <em>She clearly thinks that it is necessary for her friends to learn how to fight. Then… she must have a good reason for it. But if she fights again, it won't be alone. I want to help, too.</em></p><p>So, he settled in, leaning against the column as he sank to his knees and then rear, sitting comfortably under his invisibility cloak as he watched Crouch and Hermione engage in a mock battle for several hours, cataloging and watching the Ravenclaw witch with careful eyes.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>June 1977</strong>
</p><p>On one of the first days of summer vacation, James - still on Hogwarts time - arrived at the breakfast table with his perpetually messy hair, smothering a yawn as he mumbled, "mornin'," only to stop and stare.</p><p>"You'd best get a joke in now, son," rumbled an amused Charlus Potter as he stared at his son from over the rim of his glasses, his thin lips turning up in a smirk.</p><p>"I - you're -" James stopped and took in a breath. "Dad, why're you in <em>muggle</em> clothes?"</p><p>Next to her husband at the table, Dorea delicately stirred her teaspoon into her drink and answered for him. "Charlus was invited to spend time in Cokeworth today, darling-"</p><p>"<em>Cokeworth</em>?" repeated James, dumbstruck.</p><p>"-yes, Cokeworth, James," there was a slight hint of ire in Dorea's voice as she looked at her son. "Do pay attention. He's been invited to a party-"</p><p>"<em>A party?"</em> the young Gryffindor choked out.</p><p>"Goodness, James," said Charlus, bewildered and vaguely hurt. "Is this so difficult to believe that your old man can go out and cut a rug?"</p><p>James stopped, turning to face his father. "No, Dad, that's not it - erm…" He took a deep breath. "Sorry, let's start again. Why were you invited to a party in Cokeworth of all places? The only family we know there is the Evans'…" James' eyes went wide as he trailed off.</p><p>Charlus gave his son a knowing look. "I kept in contact with Leonard Evans, after that horrible event in Diagon Alley, when the youngest Miss Evans hurt herself."</p><p>James sat heavily in his usual seat, looking between his parents. "So, now, you're… what? Friends with Mr. Evans?"</p><p>Charlus chuckled. "Of a sort, I suppose. Although the invitation for today was more that he was going to be one of only two men surrounded by women for his daughter's birthday."</p><p>"Birthday?" James frowned. "But Hermione's birthday is in September and I know Lily celebrates hers at Hogwarts."</p><p>"His eldest, James," sighed Dorea, "Do keep up."</p><p>"So, you're going as what, moral support?" James's voice held all the skepticism he could muster. "You and some other… man…"</p><p>The potential for jealousy rose in James but he ruthlessly squashed it down. He instead eyed his father while absently reaching for a slice of toast to butter.</p><p>"Yes," agreed Charlus, eyeing his son with something like amusement, "Leonard said Miss Petunia Evans' suitor would be there. Leonard's brother and parents were unable to attend, so it was to be a strict family affair until he realized that with all three of his daughters and wife, he and Mr. Bowes would be outnumbered."</p><p>"I see," mumbled James, looking down at his hand which clenched his toast. "When do you leave?"</p><p>"Around noonish," replied his father, still eyeing him.</p><p>Dorea, opposite James, sighed loudly. "Darling, with Mr. Evans, Mr. Bowes, and your father attending, the women still outnumber the men. At any formal event, this is hardly acceptable to have an uneven number of male and female guests. Why don't you attend as well to even everything out?"</p><p>James's head popped up. "Are you sure, mum?" Then, thinking he sounded too eager, he muttered, "I was thinking of doing some flying around the pitch…"</p><p>"James. Please," said Dorea, "Just go."</p><p>So, at noon, James found himself casually dressed in nice slacks and a button-up shirt with a sweater over it - in what his mother thought was fashionable "nice" Mugglewear - as his father side-along Apparated him to Cokeworth.</p><p>They landed near the quarry again, with Charlus flicking his wand to remove any dust or stains that appeared when they landed in the dirt. The walk to the Evans' house was quiet, James tense with nerves at seeing Hermione again and speaking to her, especially only a few weeks after he had snuck into the Room of Requirement to see her practice her magic with Crouch.</p><p>Charlus seemed to take no notice of his surly son, and soon he was knocking on the last house of a street, which opened to reveal Leonard Evans, who grinned widely at seeing the two wizards.</p><p>"Charlus! Thank you so much for coming," he greeted, stepping back. As he did so, he glanced back into the hall and dropped his voice. "No, seriously, thank you. There's been so much lace and frills-"</p><p>Charlus chuckled. "Glad to oblige. I hope you don't mind that I brought my son, James, along?"</p><p>"Not at all," replied Leonard, glancing curiously at the black-haired teenager who was the bane of Lily's Hogwarts years (from his teasing and pranks), while being Hermione's friend, tutoree, and, slightly more worrisome, skirmish partner. "It's nice to finally meet you, James. I'm afraid to say that you've been a rather popular topic in our household for many years."</p><p>James cringed, blushing a furious red. "Mr. Evans - I am so sorry - I must apologize regarding my previous behaviour toward your daughter-"</p><p>"Which one?" the man asked, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>"Uh…" James froze.</p><p>Leonard and Charlus exchanged a look between them, and then Leonard was shaking his head. "Come on, join me in the living room for a bit. Sean's in there too - Rose's going a bit frantic in her planning. We're going to the carvery in town, that alright?"</p><p>"Uh, yes sir," stuttered James, glancing at his father for directions.</p><p>The three men entered the living room through a side door. The television was on, but muted, and was showing a football match. There was a couch and then two armchairs, and two seats of the couch were occupied by a burly young man - whom James thought had all the presence of a Quidditch beater - and a tall, thin young woman with blonde hair, whom he had seen before during his last visit to the house.</p><p>"Pet, Sean," began Leonard, gesturing, "This is Charlus Potter and his son. James attends school with Lily and Hermione," Charlus finished, turning to speak to Sean directly.</p><p>"Hey mate," the other man in the room said, standing to greet them. It meant withdrawing his arm from behind Petunia's shoulders, and she sighed, standing as well.</p><p>Charlus shook his hand, and then James did, although he was much more nervous than he thought in officially meeting Petunia and her boyfriend compared to when he saw her at Yule, scrubbing dirt from Hermione's cheek.</p><p>"Hey," greeted James, swallowing thickly. He turned to Petunia. "And, um, happy birthday."</p><p>"Thank you," replied Petunia.</p><p>The three stood awkwardly for a moment. Charlus and Leonard were in the armchairs, loudly discussing the match that they unmuted. James reached up to run his hand through his hair, and then realized what he was doing and cringed again when he saw Petunia eyeing him.</p><p>The door to the living room creaked open and Lily stepped in, looking down and fiddling with her blouse as she tucked it into her skirt. "Why couldn't we have gone to the pub instead, Tuney? Then I wouldn't've had to dress up-"</p><p>She froze upon seeing James. "Potter! What are you going here?"</p><p>"Erm, well," began James, flicking his eyes everywhere.</p><p>"I invited him," interrupted Petunia, narrowing her eyes on her younger sister. James's head swiveled to stare at her in surprise since he was certain that she had <em>not</em> invited him. "Since he's good friends with Hermione."</p><p>Lily frowned. "So why don't I have a friend coming as well? I can-" she bit her lip and cut a glance at Sean before speaking again "-contact Marlene or Alice-"</p><p>"No," retorted Petunia quickly.</p><p>James and Sean exchanged nervous glances as the air between the two sisters began to chill.</p><p>Petunia continued coolly, "It's my birthday, Lily. I say who comes."</p><p>The two sisters glared at each other, leaving James and Sean awkwardly standing at Petunia's side; Charlus and Leonard seemed to be completely engrossed in what they were doing and missed the exchange completely.</p><p>Another woman, smartly dressed in soft sage green and white that complimented her auburn locks entered the room next, stopping with a surprised, "oh!" as she caught sight of James. She then turned to her husband. "Leo! You didn't tell me we had guests arrive!"</p><p>As James watched Mrs. Evans greet Charlus, Petunia nudged his side. James started, blinking at her while Sean hid a snicker. "Huh?"</p><p>"We're going to leave soon. You should go get Hermione," instructed Petunia, with something of an encouraging nod at him.</p><p>Lily immediately scowled. "<em>I</em> can go get Hermy-"</p><p>"James can go get Hermione," repeated Petunia firmly, and then latched onto Lily's arm and said loudly, catching their mother's attention, "Mum! Lily's having trouble hearing things at the moment - I'm worried her ears are blocked with wax! Do you think we have some fish oil that we can use to clean them out?"</p><p>"Oh, oh, Lily dear," fussed Mrs. Evan.</p><p>Petunia took an opportunity to turn and glance at James over her shoulder, with a smirk on her face that wasn't unlike those James had seen on Slytherin's when they were plotting something - or, for that matter, Sirius's face.</p><p>"Upstairs, second door," she hissed.</p><p>This time, Sean didn't try hiding his huff of laughter.</p><p>James took the hint and edged from the room until he was back in the tiny hall and then walking upstairs. It was an odd feeling; he had never been in a purely Muggle home before and the lack of movement on the family pictures hanging from the wall was plain strange - and he had certainly never been explicitly told to go into a <em>girl's</em> room before.</p><p>There weren't many doors on the second landing: one was wide open to a bathroom; one was partially closed but a peek instead showed a very neat and organized "adult" room. There were two other doors - both 'second' and opposite of one another - and only one of them would be Hermione's room. But did she share with Petunia, or with Lily?</p><p>As James pondered, caught in his thoughts as he tried to deduce which Hermione would be in, strains of music caught his attention. There was a heavy guitar riff, followed by a pause and then the rift again. A muffled man's voice singing accompanied the music.</p><p>Clearing his throat, James knocked on the door. The music didn't stop, nor did anyone shout for him to enter. He knocked again, louder - but still, nothing.</p><p>With nothing for it, he summoned his Gryffindor bravery and turned the knob, entering the room slowly in case he needed to make a quick retreat. Instead, after opening the door, he froze at the sight that greeted him.</p><p>And slowly, a smile began to split across his face.</p><p>Hermione stood in the middle of the room, separated by two single beds and a large wardrobe overflowing with her muggle wear. A suitcase, open with neatly organized clothes, lay on the other bed, and there were faint, lighter marks on the wallpaper that indicated where posters or pictures rested but had now been removed. That side was Petunia's, while Hermione's was a mess, and, as James grinned, so was Hermione.</p><p>A record player rest on a side table next to Hermione's bed and was in the process of moving through its song. Hermione was enjoying it, bent at the waist and letting her long, red-tinged brown hair swish back and forth as she headbanged.</p><p>"<em>So I took a big chance at the high school dance / With a missy who was ready to play / Was it me she was foolin'? / 'Cause she knew what she was doin' / Told me how to walk this way / She told me to-"</em></p><p>Hermione tossed her head back and pretended to strum an imaginary guitar, eyes closed and a frown of concentration on her face.</p><p>James was caught between stifling a laugh and swallowing thickly; laughing at her antics, and having trouble swallowing as his eyes roamed down her curly hair to her bare shoulders. She wore only a black bra to cover her top, and then his eyes roved down her toned stomach to the black capris that hugged her hips and long legs, and then caught on the brightly painted blue toenails.</p><p>As Steve Tyler sang, "walk this way," Hermione turned to face James and opened her eyes.</p><p>She shrieked, leaping backward and bumping her hip into the side table, causing the needle to skip over the record and off the turntable.</p><p>He waved sheepishly. "Hello."</p><p>"Jesus <em>Christ</em>," she snapped, turning and hastily snatching up a short-sleeve blouse that was on her bed. She clutched it to her chest. "What the fuck, James?!"</p><p>"Sorry," he apologized sheepishly, turning to present his back to her as she shrugged the blouse on. He couldn't stop grinning.</p><p>"You don't sound it," she grumbled. "Anyway, what are you doing here?"</p><p>"Your dad invited mine to your sister's birthday lunch," explained James, resisting the urge to turn and face her when speaking. "And my mother noted that there would be an uneven number of men and women, so suggested I join."</p><p>Hermione snorted and touched James's shoulder. He turned to face her, quickly wiping the smile from his face but his cheeks were still flushed, and his hazel eyes were bright.</p><p>She scowled, pointing at him. "Don't!"</p><p>"Wasn't gonna," he cheerfully replied.</p><p>"Hermione! James! We're heading out now," called Leonard from downstairs. "Come down!"</p><p>James followed a grumbling Hermione as she stomped down the stairs, fighting the urge to whistle. But he quickly schooled his face upon seeing Hermione's parents and his father, as well as a glowering Lily.</p><p>Petunia, however, sent him a wink then left him reeling. <em>What the hell? Did she set that up?</em></p><p>The large group walked into town, to the carvery. The Evans' were careful when speaking to James, trying to keep from revealing information about magic in front of Sean, but were able to keep to generic topics such as the weather and politics until they were sat at their table.</p><p>The adults seemed to cluster at one end, leaving Petunia as the birthday girl at the opposite head, with Sean on her right and Hermione on her left; James quickly sat next to Hermione while Lily sat opposite him, with her mother next to her and Charlus next to James. Leonard Evans took the other head, and soon they had ordered their drinks and got up to the buffet.</p><p>It was only once they began eating did James's nerves return, s Sean turned to him and asked, "So, James. You attend the same school as Lily and Hermione. How do you know them?"</p><p>James fiddled with his fork and moved his food around but answered, "Lily and I are in the same house. Hermione was actually tutoring me for the past two years."</p><p>"Really? In what?" Sean glanced at Hermione. "I knew you were a genius, Hermione-"</p><p>"Maths," she answered, bored. "James is terrible at it."</p><p>"I am not!" James automatically protested.</p><p>Hermione cut her eyes at the teenager sitting beside her and smirked.</p><p>"Well," he amended, "Not anymore, at least."</p><p>"Does that mean you did well in your exam?" asked Sean curiously, leaning a bit forward.</p><p>James nodded. "Yeah, I got an Exceeds-"</p><p>Opposite him, Lily scowled deeply and shifted in her seat, at the same time sending her foot out and kicking James in the shin.</p><p>"<em>Yeoooww-</em>!" James stopped and looked at Petunia's terrified face and Hermione's raised eyebrows before quickly altering, "an exceedingly high mark."</p><p>"James isn't that interested in academics," Lily quickly inserted, with the tiniest frown on her face as she tossed her hair back, glancing at Sean sitting beside her. "He's much more interested in being a bully and pranking people." Hermione snorted into her broccoli, causing Lily to glare at her. "Do you disagree, Herms?"</p><p>Glancing up from under her brows, Hermione asked, "When did you last see James play a prank, <em>Lils</em>?"</p><p>Lily opened her mouth to retort, but then thought about the question and stopped. James watched her as her mind whirled through the past months at Hogwarts, and even he could admit it had been <em>months</em> since he had engaged in a prank at the same level that he used to do.</p><p>Feeling a bit more confident with himself, James leaned back, stretching and placed his arm behind Hermione's chair, resting it along the back. Hermione tensed but then loosened immediately afterward, turning back to her vegetables as Lily gapped, open-mouthed at James.</p><p>"I take my studies very seriously," he said, turning back to Sean, who had been watching the three carefully. "A lot of the pranks I did in the past did have an element of research to them-"</p><p>"Like what?" asked Sean, interested, and leaning forward.</p><p>James, feeling pleased with the question and the interest the other teenager showed, leaned forward as well, brushing into Hermione's personal space as he spoke across the table. From the corner of his eye, he could see Lily, utterly bewildered at how easily he got along with the muggle. After a bit longer, she just blinked, shaking her head, and turned to her mother to join her in conversation.</p><p>For the next hour or so, over the rest of lunch and dessert, James enjoyed himself as he learned about Sean - who was also an athlete - and even Petunia. He knew he had won points when he asked about her university career and mentioned her Christmas present that Hermione got for her, and the blonde had beamed back, enthusing about how much she loved the variety pack.</p><p>And throughout it all, at his side, Hermione never once shifted away from him. She didn't turn and ask him to remove his arm, nor did she shy away from his body.</p><p>Risking things a bit more, as the group began to stand and stretch, ready to walk back to the house, James found himself at the back of the group with Hermione at his side. In front of them, Petunia and Sean walked arm-in-arm, while Lily walked with her parents and Charlus.</p><p>Hermione's hand brushed against his as they walked, and after a few moments, at the next brush, his hand turned slightly and caught hers.</p><p>Hermione froze.</p><p>Keeping his face forward, swallowing nervously, James shifted so his hand gripped hers. He did his best to ignore that his palm was a bit sweaty, and his pulse was fluttering rapidly against his wrist in those brief moments it took for Hermione to react.</p><p>But then she shifted her grip and curled her fingers against his.</p><p>James exhaled loudly, glancing at her and saw her smirk despite looking forward as well. With his free hand, he ran it through his hair and gave a breathless laugh. "I really <em>did</em> do well on my Arithmancy exam. I'm sure it was an Exceeds Expectations, at least."</p><p>Hermione turned to face him. "I'm really happy for you. You've worked hard over the years to improve your grade."</p><p>"It was all you," he replied with a grin.</p><p>She shook her head. "No, it was your hard work. 'Sides, now you don't need me anymore."</p><p>The thought of no longer seeing her on Friday nights made his heart clench in his chest and his hand spasmed, gripping her tightly for a moment as it did so.</p><p>The two of them slowed down in their walk until they stopped, the rest of the group leaving them behind as the two stood on the side of the street, looking at one another. James took a step closer to her, keeping their hands linked as he peered down at Hermione.</p><p>"I think," he said, very quietly, "I'm always going to need you in my life."</p><p>Hermione blinked up at him in surprise, her mouth parting into a tiny 'o' as her breath hitched. "James…?"</p><p>With his free hand, he brushed some hair off Hermione's forehead. "Just because you don't need to tutor me in Arithmancy, doesn't mean we don't have to spend time together, right?"</p><p>"Right…" Hermione nodded slowly, eyes darting all over his face, searching for something.</p><p>James took another step closer. They were almost chest to chest. "In fact," he began, his voice dropping lower, "I'd… I'd really like it, if… if…"</p><p>Hermione's own reply was a bit breathless. "Yes…?"</p><p>"If we spent more time together," said James, rushing the words out, and taking a step back. "Like… Friday nights. But without Arithmancy. And - And - Hogsmeade trips - and sitting together-"</p><p>"James," there was amusement in Hermione's voice now. "Are you asking me out?"</p><p>"I - yes," he stuttered, nodding once, firmly.</p><p>Hermione's mouth twisted up into a pleased smile. "Okay."</p><p>James blinked. "What - <em>okay</em>?" he squeaked.</p><p>"Okay," she repeated, turning to begin walking again.</p><p>James felt his lips stretch into a lopsided smile, allowing Hermione to lead him as he was a bit dazed. <em>She… she said yes!</em></p><p>But he definitely noticed when she shifted her grip from holding his hand to lacing their fingers together - and he denied it to his father later when they were home, but he was unable to stop smiling for the rest of the day because Hermione Evans had said yes to dating him.</p><hr /><p>

</p><p>"Reggie!"</p><p>Regulus closed his eyes as he stopped his brisk walk. He felt his form tense, for the briefest moment, and then he deliberately relaxed his shoulders and opened his eyes in time for his cousin to appear around him from behind, wearing traditional witches' robes in black - a bit of a bold choice for her sister's wedding.</p><p>"Bella," said Regulus, carefully modulating his voice. Hermione had made it clear that she had fought Bellatrix in Diagon Alley (not that Bella knew who <em>she</em> was fighting), but also that she was a follower of the Dark Lord.</p><p><em>She probably knows about the horcruxes,</em> he thought, keeping the disgust from his face as he nodded politely.</p><p>"Do you have a minute, little coz?" the older witch, nearly thirty, asked. Her eyes went wide, and her lips, painted bloodred, stretched into a wide smile.</p><p>"I suppose," replied Regulus, despite not wanting to. "But not too much time; mother has me scheduled to make a toast to Narcissa and Lucius in about twenty."</p><p>"Oh, this won't take that long," replied Bellatrix, still with that large, fixed smile on her face. With her wide eyes, it made her look wild and a bit addled like she was doped up on Felix Felicis. "Let's then; 'Dolph is coming, too."</p><p>Regulus sighed, turning as Bellatrix did and noticing for the first time that her husband was waiting for them at the end of the hall, the opposite direction Regulus had originally been heading in. The tall, thin wizard with dark brown hair kept his face blank but had his arms crossed and was leaning against the wall in between two portraits that kept eyeing him and tilting their pointy Malfoy chins up in disapproval.</p><p>With Rudolphus and Bellatrix bookending him, Regulus sighed and asked in disinterest, hoping it hid the furious pounding of his heart, "And where are we doing?"</p><p>"Just to the study, little coz," replied Bellatrix. "I wanted to introduce you to some of the guests Lucius invited but you didn't yet meet."</p><p>Regulus's brow furrowed minutely. "I thought I met everyone…"</p><p>"Not everyone," chortled Rudolphus, a surprisingly warm sound for a man that was coming across as cold in demeanour.</p><p>They approached a nondescript door at the far end of the hall, well away from where the wedding reception was taking place in the ballroom and the other guests. The hallway itself was silent, with their footsteps echoing against the wooden floor and panelled walls.</p><p>Rudolphus reached the door first and paused with his hand on the knob. He turned back to face Regulus and said, quietly, "Be polite. Be proud. Be a <em>Black</em>."</p><p>Bewildered, Regulus blinked, just as Rudolphus knocked with his other hand and hen turned the knob, swiftly entering the room.</p><p>Bellatrix urged him inside, and Regulus stepped in.</p><p>It was one of the many guest receiving rooms, this one a bit more masculine and probably a smoking room from an era passed, given the heavy dark furniture and the thick curtains that hung from only two windows overlooking the front of the property. Through one, Regulus could see peacocks grazing; the other was blocked by the silhouette of a man - a tall, thin man in tailored wizard's robes - blocking much of the light from the setting sun.</p><p>There were a few other wizards in the room - no other women other than Bellatrix, who quickly moved to the chair nearest the standing wizard and perching herself on the arm, crossing her legs - and only a few that Regulus recognized by face, mainly for their fierce, untamed or haughty Pureblood looks. Some were business associates of his father, and the others were known as criminals by the Aurors.</p><p>Regulus found himself pausing just a few steps inside the dark room and swallowed thickly as his eyes drew back to the figure by the window, who had very pale hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>Slowly, the wizard turned, revealing thinning black hair swept back off his forehead; narrow, piercing green eyes; a long straight nose, and very thin lips. His face was pale, and angular in a way that wasn't quite right. As the man continued to turn, Regulus felt his mouth drying up - the wizard was cloaking himself with his magic, and it <em>thrummed</em>, ready to be unleashed in the barest moment.</p><p>His thin lips turned up at the sight of Regulus, and Regulus' legs began to tremble, luckily hidden by the outer folds of his wizard robes.</p><p>Then the wizard opened his mouth, and Lord Voldemort purred, "Ah, young Mister Black. I've been looking forward to meeting you for some time, now…"</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC...</p>

  <strong>July 1977</strong>
</p><p>Summer was always dull for Hermione. When she was Hermione Granger, her parents had her enrolled in numerous activities and school programs to enhance her learning and continue her Muggle education. Not only did it allow her parents to continue to work fulltime, but it also had the added benefit of keeping her busy and maintaining their comfortable lifestyle with trips to France and Switzerland once or twice a year.</p><p>The Evans were different: Rose was a stay-at-home-mum, while Leo worked full time, often travelling for his job. Leo's brother – Hermione's uncle – was unmarried and a bit of a player, often back and forth to Britain with stops to Majorca, or even further abroad like Morocco, St.-Tropez, and sometimes Australia. The Evans grandparents – Humphrey and Marie – were getting on in their age and with Petunia now in London for college, Lily took up the task of spending time with them and Rose at their house a few streets over.</p><p>Which left Hermione… currently laying with her back on the floor of her bedroom – Petunia's old bedroom – with her knees bent over the edge of the mattress to lay flat on the duvet. She had finished all her core pre-sixth-year homework and was even ahead in her prep for her NEWTs in her remaining advanced class: Charms. The rest of her NEWTs would have to wait until her seventh year.</p><p>Thus: she was bored out of her mind.</p><p>She didn't have a summer job; she finished her schoolwork; she was well ahead of any Muggle material and the Evans' didn't particularly care for her to keep up with it anyway; and ever since Lily and Snape stopped speaking, she had no reason to tag along and glower at the dour Slytherin when he inevitably tried to flirt with Lily and spectacularly crashed and burned at the park by the polluted river.</p><p>With nothing to keep her attention, Hermione found her mind wandering. Even since she noticed her memories were hazy, thanks to the Room of Requirement and not-Harry, Hermione had taken to heart the decision to live in the here and now of her present. With sixteen years under her belt – almost half her Granger-self's lifespan – things were becoming fuzzier. What shade of red had Ron's hair been? Did Bill have the fang earring on his left or right ear, or was it Charlie who wore the earring? Did Luna wear her lion-roaring hat for Harry's fifth year Quidditch matches, or the sixth? What order did Professor Lupin have his Defense obstacle course items in? Did Harry's eyes flash in ire like Lily's, or did they sparkle with mischief the way James' did?</p><p><em>James</em>.</p><p>He was something unexpected. Just thinking of him had Hermione's heart clench and speed up. She had never felt that way about Harry - or maybe she had, once, but not past their fifth year when things had changed.</p><p>At first, Hermione was so sure that she'd get James and Harry confused and that she'd look at James and want him to be her Harry. After all, so many people had said that Harry was just like James. But that wasn't true, at all. Harry wasn't like James, and James wasn't Harry. Even if it took her nearly all of her fourth year to see that.</p><p>Maybe that was why she gave in to those budding feelings - of wanting to see where things might go. Hermione wasn't under any impressions that they'd be together long, after all; the end of his story was with Lily, even if her sister was currently being a twat.</p><p>And with that, Hermione's thoughts turned from James to her sister, and the growing divide between her and Lily while she mended things with Petunia. What was she going to do with her redheaded sister?</p><p>A frown pulled at Hermione's face and she brought a hand up, using two fingers to pinch at her lower lip as she plucked it absently in thought. Thinking about Lily - and their current Cold War - was headache-inducing. Both sisters were stubborn and unlikely to make the first move in broaching their jealousies and arrogance, and Hermione had a double dose of that from her Granger-self.</p><p>Hermione's frown deepened. Her headache was growing stronger - like an actual pounding between her eyes… except… that… <em>wasn't </em>her headache. Hermione swung her legs down and off the bed and rolled onto her knees, head turned toward the open bedroom door and into the hallway. Another loud bang echoed through the house, followed by another two more.</p><p>Hermione gripped her wand in her right hand and crept into the hallway landing of the second floor. The pounding at the door was louder, but instead of going to the front door, Hermione turned at the bottom of the stairs and went to the kitchen, and then out the back door.</p><p>The midday light was thin and reedy, pushing through greying clouds that hung low and promised rain; the air was a bit cool for summer. The Evans' back garden was Rose's pride and joy, filled with flower boxes bursting with colour and even a few herb patches that Lily attended to for her potion-making. The sidewall separating the family's end rowhouse to the muddy meadow was a crumbling stone half wall, held together mostly by the vines of a creeping ivy that stretched along the wall from the house to the back, which paralleled the back garden to the house and street behind theirs.</p><p>Hermione vaulted over the half wall, landing heavily in a muddy puddle. With a scowl, she kicked her feet up as she stepped out of the puddle and around the edge of the house, glancing at the front and wondering who was pounding so heavily on the door, ignoring the Muggle doorbell.</p><p>"Barty?" Hermione let her wand drop from her hand as she stared in confusion.</p><p>At her voice, her best friend turned sharply on his heel, swinging around the heavy body clutched to his chest.</p><p>Hermione's heart caught in her throat and she rushed around the side of the house. "Regulus? What's going on?"</p><p>"Help me get him inside!" barked Barty, his eyes a much lighter brown than normal. His hair was frazzled and there was a panicked look to him in how his eyes darted around the street.</p><p>Without speaking, Hermione hefted Regulus's dead weight on Barty's other side, and together they hauled the unconscious - or dazed, Hermione wasn't sure - teen toward the sidewall. With Barty hopping over first, the two Ravenclaws were able to bodily shove Regulus up and over without too much damage and then through the open back door, through the kitchen, and up the stairs to Hermione's bedroom, where Regulus was placed on the bed. Hermione hastily wrapped a throw blanket around Regulus, who absently clutched at it to keep it around himself.</p><p>He shivered, his skin icy cold and his eyes vacant.</p><p>"What happened?" hissed Hermione, turning to face Barty, eyes wide. "I thought he was supposed to be at the Malfoy wedding!"</p><p>Barty ran his hands through his straight straw-coloured hair and folded in on himself, falling to the carpeted floor. "I don't know - I don't! He just - just showed up at our townhouse, like this!"</p><p>"He was there."</p><p>Both Ravenclaws turned to their Slytherin friend. Some colour was slowly returning to his pale cheeks, and his shivering was beginning to slow, but his voice was low and stilted like he was learning to speak again after a long period of silence.</p><p>Hermione frowned. "Who?"</p><p>Regulus' grey eyes darted up from the spot he was looking at on the carpet to bore into her. They were wider than normal, something haunted in them. "<em>Him</em>, Hermione."</p><p>Hermione blinked while Barty, confused, demanded, "Him <em>who</em>, Reg? What are you talking about?"</p><p>"The Dark Lord."</p><p>The words were whispered, torn from Regulus in a quick hiss. Upon speaking the words, it felt like all the air had escaped the room and the temperature plunged rapidly into freezing territory. Hermione wrapped her arms around her chest and fought back a shiver.</p><p>"He was at the wedding?" asked Barty, blinking incredulously. He paused and then asked, "Do you think he brought a wedding present?"</p><p>Hermione snorted, imagining Tom Riddle as she knew him at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, nose-less with red eyes and pale skin, handing over a pretty wrapped wedding gift with a bow and telling Narcissa how beautiful a bride she made.</p><p>Regulus, however, shot to his feet, letting the blanket fall. "Don't joke about him! Don't!"</p><p>"Easy, mate." Barty nervously licked his lips as he held his hands up in a placating gesture. He stepped to the side, so it didn't look like he was blocking Regulus in. "It was a joke–"</p><p>"Don't joke about it, please," begged Regulus in a torn voice. His eyes darted between Barty and Hermione. "Don't, okay? Gods, it was like – it was like he knew <em>everything</em>. I swear I almost pissed myself."</p><p>"Knew? Did he use legilimency on you?" asked Hermione urgently. She reached forward, her hands gripping Regulus' shoulders tightly. She stared hard at him. "Regulus - did he?"</p><p>"I-I think he did," muttered Regulus, turning inward as he thought back to the experience, "But – but he wasn't looking for - for <em>that</em>. Just - just thoughts on –"</p><p>"Mudbloods and blood traitors," finished Hermione, her lip curling up.</p><p>Regulus gave a jerky nod. "He knows about you."</p><p>Hermione jerked back, her hands pulling off Regulus like she was shocked. "<em>Me</em>?"</p><p>"He has other Slytherins - other students - pledging themselves to him," whispered Regulus, glancing at Barty as well. The taller teenager curled his hands into fists at his side and a low noise rumbled from his throat in response to the threat. "They weren't quiet about a Ravenclaw who wrote two NEWTs in her fifth year."</p><p>Hermione's eyes narrowed. "He does know that I'm a dirty mudblood, though, right?"</p><p>"Can you stop calling yourself that?" bit Barty, glaring at her. "You're so much more than that - than what they think!"</p><p>"You're sweet, Barty, but as far as his purebloods and this Dark Lord go, I'm a magic-stealing lower-than-dirt bitch," retorted Hermione, cutting Barty some side-eye. "I could be Merlin, Morgana, and Nimue reincarnated and I doubt it would change anything."</p><p>"You might be further off your mark than you think," sighed Regulus as his colouring slowly returned. He bent and picked up the blanket, absently folding it to keep his hands busy as he spoke. "He's interested in you now. It doesn't help that we're friends, and he wants me to keep an eye on you."</p><p>Hermione goggled. "What, like a spy?"</p><p>Regulus nodded.</p><p>"Fucking brilliant," swore Barty, turning his back on the two as he ran his hands through his hair, making thin pieces stick up in his agitation. "Hermione's now in the spellsight of a crazy Dark Lord!"</p><p>"So are you," muttered Regulus. Barty swung around to stare at him. "Your dad is Head Auror, and you're smart. He's recruiting, Barty. Half of the men in that room with him…" Regulus shivered. "Half of them I knew from my father's dealings at the Ministry. He's already deep there."</p><p>Hermione slowly sat on her bed, a tiny frown between her brows. "But - what did he want with you, Reg? You were introduced to him for a reason, other than to check on you. What was it?"</p><p>"The first was to learn about you and Barty," sighed Regulus, moving to Hermione's desk and spinning her wooden chair around to sit on it. For the first time in a long while, Regulus was not well composed: he leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees and buried his hands in his short, curly hair.</p><p>He closed his eyes and let out an aggravated sigh. "Everyone knows we're friends. We've never hidden it, and both Barty and I are well known in the pureblood circles. Having a - <em>muggleborn </em>- as a friend is enough of an oddity that he wanted to know why."</p><p>"And then he learned how smart she is." Barty crossed his arms and planted his feet in the middle of the room, glaring at a poster of ABBA on the bedroom wall - a leftover of Petunia's.</p><p>"I - I showed him some of our sessions," said Regulus, glancing between Barty - who was scowling fiercely at the floor - and Hermione - who was frowning in contemplation but keeping her eyes fixed on Regulus as he spoke. "He thinks I keep you around to improve my grades. To learn more magic. He's not too impressed that a muggleborn is uncovering magical shortcuts–"</p><p>"So, he's interested enough in my abilities that he thinks you care more about the magic than our friendship," summed Hermione quickly, leaning back on her hands as she tilted her head up to the ceiling. "He always did like to collect unique things."</p><p>Regulus narrowed his eyes. "<em>Always?</em>"</p><p>Barty quickly jumped in, asking, "What unique things?"</p><p>Hermione took the distraction, sighing. "Like the Diadem of Ravenclaw."</p><p>"That lost thing?" chuckled Barty. "What does–"</p><p>He stopped, glancing between Regulus' slightly guilty face and Hermione's tired one.</p><p>"You found it?" he squeaked, then shook his head, muttering, "Of <em>course</em> you found it, Hermione…"</p><p>"He also <em>destroyed </em>it," hissed Regulus, catching Barty's attention. "He turned it into a Horcrux–" at his friends' look, he continued quickly, "He put a piece of his own <em>soul</em> in the diadem. If he dies, he loses his physical body, but a part of his soul remains, and he can get a new body if he completes a ritual."</p><p>Barty paled and wobbled a bit where he stood, shock making him stumble until he reached the edge of Hermione's bed. He sank down on it slowly, one arm extended absently as he used it to stabilize his descent. "He's… he's <em>immortal</em>?"</p><p>"Partially," confirmed Hermione with a twist of her lips. "Horcruxes can be destroyed. Just not easily."</p><p>"How?" asked Barty through thin, bloodless lips. He stared at Hermione like she was offering a starving man his favourite meal.</p><p>"Fiendfyre and basilisk venom, for sure," confirmed the witch, curling a piece of hair around her fingers. "There might be other ways, but I know those work."</p><p>Regulus narrowed his eyes. "You've seen it. Just like you know he has more than one Horcrux."</p><p>"More than one?!" yelped Barty, this time falling off the edge of the bed.</p><p>Hermione waved an absent hand. "The diadem is the only one we can access since it's at Hogwarts. The others are… too well protected."</p><p>"Yeah, well, we might have access to another," muttered Regulus darkly, leaning back in his seat and folding his arms tightly against himself.</p><p>"What do you mean, Reg?" asked Hermione slowly, just as Barty stared up at him from the floor, frozen.</p><p>"He - the Dark Lord - he wants me to send Kreacher to him next week, on, and I quote, 'a very special mission,'" the Black teen offered with a slight sneer to his voice. "I can only imagine what he needs a house elf for - and a way to ensure my cooperation through blackmail. Offer me - the official heir to the Ancient and Noble House of Black - something precious, something that if it goes missing… well. Why would a Black betray the Dark Lord with my mother and cousins so deeply involved?"</p><p>"But," there was disbelief in Barty's hoarse whisper, "But you're purebloods. Part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight…"</p><p>"It won't matter." Hermione stared at Regulus in mounting horror. "He'll kill them if you betray him–"</p><p>"Maybe not 'Meda herself, but she has a Muggleborn husband and half-blood daughter now," said Regulus, shaking his head. "And he'll go after Sirius for sure and Narcissa, too, to send a message, maybe even her husband to clean the house. And I'll bet every last galleon I have that he'd order Bella to do it and she would, happily."</p><p>"Fuck," whispered Barty, eyes wide. "Fuck." He turned those eyes to Hermione. "What do we do? Gods, what <em>should</em> we do? <em>Do</em> we do anything? We should go to my father about this – or, even Dumbledore–"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Barty and Regulus stared at Hermione.</p><p>"No," she repeated. "I–"</p><p><em>I bled red once before,</em> she had thought, a long time ago. <em>Never again</em>, was what she promised herself.</p><p>And there was no way she'd drag Barty and Regulus into it; Regulus already died defying Voldemort in a previous timeline, and Barty had gone mad as a loyal Death Eater. Those men from her previous life were the <em>what-could-be</em>s of this newer reality, but Hermione was not going to let that happen. She would not see Barty - her loyal, funny, hot-tempered best friend - turn into the twitchy, Dark Arts practitioner and sycophant that helped kill Cedric Diggory.</p><p>Nor would she see her cool, assessing but deeply emotional Slytherin turn into one of Voldemort's Inferi, thinking he had to be brave alone, that he was all alone without a support system because he was a Slytherin and not a Gryffindor, thinking he had to live up to being <em>Sirius</em> to make a difference–</p><p>No. She would not have them turn to Dumbledore, have them turn into his pawns, his soldiers to do with at will. She was under no illusion that Dumbledore was an innocent man; he was, at best a general, and at worst, poorly suited for the role. He kept secrets and maneuvered people into positions that would lend to optimal results - and most of the time, someone died in the process.</p><p>"I already knew about the Horcruxes." Hermione's mouth was moving, words emerging before she was fully cognizant of it. "I already had some ideas on how to destroy them. You don't need to do anything. I'll handle it."</p><p>"<em>Pardon me</em>," bit out Regulus, affronted, just as Barty snapped, angrily as he jumped to his feet, "<em>We</em> don't need to do anything?"</p><p>Hermione glanced between the two. Barty glowered at her and Regulus was staring at her flatly. Both had unimpressed frowns on their faces.</p><p>"What do you mean, you'll 'handle it'?" Regulus' mouth turned down further. "Was mail-ordering basilisk venom your way of <em>handling it</em>, Hermione?"</p><p>"It was a start," she mumbled, glancing away.</p><p>"But <em>alone</em>?" barked Barty, straightening to his full height. "If you think for just one second that I'll let you go off alone on your own without me–"</p><p>"I don't want to see you get hurt!" cried Hermione, jumping off the bed to face off against Barty who snapped his mouth shut. "Either of you! I know what Horcruxes can do to someone about to destroy them – and it's – it's <em>horrible</em>. I don't want you going through that."</p><p>"Oh, like we want <em>you</em> to do that?" scoffed Regulus, slowly rising from the chair as that all three were standing, in a loose triangular pattern, staring each other down. "And don't think I've forgotten that you know all this Hermione–"</p><p>"Oh, it doesn't <em>matter</em> how she knows!" snapped Barty, "She's thinking of being a stupid Gryffindor right now, Reg! Planning on running off without us!" He glowered at her. "<em>Why</em>, Hermione? Why you? Why do you get to play the fucking martyr?"</p><p>"I–" Hermione stared at Barty; her mouth open. Not so long ago, she had been <em>so sure</em> that she wouldn't get involved, that she would sit at the sidelines and let the war go on without her. She would privately grieve but she would be removed from it, from those dying because she hadn't planned on getting involved with James Potter, or Sirius Black; and it would only be Lily to mourn privately.</p><p>But then she began tutoring James; she spent more time with Sirius; and she and Lily had their blow-up but here, in this time, Lily was <em>her sister</em>, and she couldn't let things lie as they were without Lily knowing that she still loved her – it was as inconceivable as fighting with Harry and Ron in her third year, or their fourth, or during the Horcrux hunt, and not making up. Like someone had cut off one of her limbs and she was forced to make do around it but still feeling its phantom mark on her soul…</p><p>"I– I don't want to make this difficult," sputtered Hermione, catching Regulus' dark look only to turn and see Barty's scowl deepen, "But you don't need to do this – you're both sixteen –"</p><p>"Like you aren't?" muttered Barty.</p><p>"I once thought I could ignore this. But–"</p><p>Regulus sighed, something like understanding crossing his face. "But then Diagon Alley happened."</p><p>Hesitantly, Hermione nodded. "Then Diagon Alley happened."</p><p>"You… you fought Bella." Regulus held Hermione's gaze, looking for confirmation. She nodded again, just as hesitantly. Regulus muttered something under his breath. "Does she know it was you?"</p><p>"I don't think so," replied Hermione.</p><p>"She'll figure it out though," said Barty, his voice pitching up in fear. "If not her, someone else working for the Dark Lord."</p><p>"He's already suspicious enough as it is," confirmed Regulus, "With how powerful you are. If Bella tells him what happened–"</p><p>"What?" snorted Hermione. "That she was badly trounced by a teenager?"</p><p>"And three Potters," added Barty quietly, "One of which is her great-aunt, and the other – well, Potter fancies you–"</p><p>"I know!" Hermione's voice was strained. "I <em>know</em>. James and I – we – I know, Barty."</p><p>"So, they'll figure it out sooner or later," said Regulus after a few moments of quiet. "And then they'll <em>really</em> want me to spy on you."</p><p>"You're not taking the mark!" snapped Hermione.</p><p>"Mark?" repeated Barty.</p><p>Regulus looked sick. "He <em>marks</em> them?"</p><p>Hermione let her shoulders drop. "Pretty, unique things. He collects them, remember? They're <em>his</em>. And nothing says that better than a brand."</p><p>Regulus' face paled and then took on a green tinge.</p><p>"We really can't tell anyone, can we?" whispered Barty in horror. "Who'd believe us? And even if someone did, we'd get them killed. Gods, Hermione, with what you know–"</p><p>Hermione didn't need to speak. Instead, she sank back down on her bed, shoving her hands between her knees. "I thought I could ignore this. I could ignore him. And then… when Diagon Alley happened – I… well, I thought I could do it on my own."</p><p>"But why?" asked Barty, plaintively, taking a few steps forward until he was perched on the bed too, reaching forward and grabbing Hermione by the shoulders to force her to look at him. "Why would you need to do it alone?"</p><p>"We've been here the whole time," added Regulus. "You already trusted us with wandless casting and your transmutations, Hermione. Why is this so different?"</p><p>"Because – because – I can't ignore him. I can't ignore what he's going to do," she stuttered, looking from Barty to Regulus, and then strangely, at her left arm. She fixated on it for a long moment, her right hand coming up to trace a finger down from her elbow to wrist, pressing into the blemish-free skin.</p><p>"Sometimes, I wish I could." She laughed quietly, humourlessly. She shook her head. "My life would be a lot easier if I could ignore it!"</p><p>"A lot of things would be easier if we could ignore them," agreed Regulus quietly. He crouched so he was before Hermione and reached out, placing a hand on her knee. "But Blacks don't ignore their problems. They make them go away."</p><p>Barty snorted. "By throwing money at their problems, or by killing them?"</p><p>Regulus's smile was all teeth. "Whichever works."</p><p>"I don't think we can pay off the Dark Lord," replied Hermione with a weak smile.</p><p>"No, but we can kill him," replied Regulus, "One piece at a time."</p><p>Barty stared. "You want to go after the Horcruxes?"</p><p>"One's at Hogwarts," the Black teen said. He turned to Hermione "And you still have the venom, right?"</p><p>She nodded, slowly. "I hadn't decided the best way to destroy the Horcrux before you asked me about what I was up to."</p><p>"And… well… I'm pretty sure that he's going to take Kreacher somewhere or give him another," added Regulus. "We can wait a few days and then go after it ourselves."</p><p>"And when he inevitably checks on it?" asked Barty, raising his eyebrows. "He'll know you - or at least, a Black - betrayed him."</p><p>"Hopefully that won't be until after all the other pieces are gone," replied Regulus, although there was a flicker of worry in his grey eyes.</p><p>The three were silent for a long, long time, remaining as still as statues as they were lost in their own thoughts of what they were planning.</p><p>"Are we really doing this?" Barty finally whispered.</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips. "I guess we are."</p><p>"Holy shit," muttered Barty, licking his lips nervously as he ran a hand through his straight hair. "Holy shit."</p><p>Grimly, Regulus added, "Let's kill a Dark Lord."</p><hr /><p>Regulus' letter came late on Friday evening, through Hermione's open window while her parents and Lily sat downstairs and watched the television. It simply read: <em>He took Kreacher.</em></p><p>Hermione's mood was sour, and she realized that she would need to implement something like her Protean-charmed galleons. Owl mail was going to be unreliable going forward, especially if her friends were dead set on killing Voldemort with her.</p><p>Less than six hours later, in the middle of the night, Regulus sent the second owl: <em>We were right. I have a location</em>.</p><p>Dawn found Hermione standing in the back garden, a lighter in one hand and the letters in the other. She lit one edge and watched the flames lick up the side of the thick parchment until she dropped the burning papers in a bucket at her feet. There could be no paper trail – nothing to tie her, Regulus, and Barty to what they were planning.</p><p>Wrapped in a warm shawl and still in her pajamas, Hermione sat on a cold wrought iron seat, part of a bistro set, and began to write a reply to Barty and Regulus when another owl interrupted her, landing on the back of the second seat.</p><p>Hermione stared. "What do you have for me?"</p><p>The owl hooted and extended its leg, where a letter was tied. Hermione undid the rope, unfolding the parchment. Her eyebrows rose at the glance of the signature at the bottom, even as she settled in the seat, pulling her sock-clad feet up and tucking them underneath her as she sat cross-legged on the chair.</p><p><em>Dear Hermione,</em> the letter began, in a messy teenage boy's scrawl that hinted at penmanship lessons, with little flourishes on certain letters.</p><p>
  <em>I hope this letter finds you well and that you are enjoying the summer break from Hogwarts. Things are never dull here at Potter Manor with Sirius staying over permanently now; he's moved in and claimed the bedroom he's always used when staying over but now he has his posters up on the wall. Mum's not too impressed by the Muggle models, but she's not "pitching a fit," as Sirius's mum would've. So I guess that's something!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I realize that when I last saw you, at Petunia's birthday, we didn't really discuss any plans. And by plans, I mean… What comes next? Are we together now? Dating? Because I would like to take you out on a date, a proper one. And maybe not in Diagon Alley - I don't want to risk a repeat of our last meal there. Maybe… maybe you could show me something Muggle? In London? We could meet at the Leaky.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When would be good for you? Owl me back.</em>
</p><p>The letter then finished with, <em>Yours - James</em>, and something in Hermione's stomach fluttered as her fingers lightly traced over the signature.</p><p>"You, Mr. Potter," she murmured, "Are not what I was expecting."</p><p>The owl hooted again, reminding Hermione that it was waiting for a reply. Considering that the plan would be to go after the cave Horcrux as soon as possible - something Hermione didn't know the full details of, as Harry had been cagey about whatever happened that night - Hermione did not want to meet up with James too soon.</p><p>After finishing her identical letters to Regulus and Barty, confirming that she and Barty would take the Knight Bus to the seaside village that Kreacher told Regulus the cave was nearest for the following afternoon, Hermione wrote her reply to James.</p><p>
  <em>Dear James - how does next Friday sound? I'm a bit busy with a project at the moment, but I'll be free then, I think. Meet at the Leaky for 11? I know a place in London where we can go for lunch.</em>
</p><p>She dawdled on how to end her letter, tapping her fountain pen on the bistro table a few times before finally writing, a bit splotchy in her hesitancy, <em>Yours, Hermione</em>.</p><p>The owl took James' letter, leaving the other two, and Hermione packed her supplies up. The only other owl in the house, Lily's Jackie-O, was in her sisters' room and Hermione was loathed to enter Lily's room before the teenager was up and had a few cups of tea in her system. With a sigh, Hermione resolved herself to a rather boring morning.</p><p><em>Then again,</em> she told herself with a wry twist to her lips, <em>right now - boring is good. Tomorrow won't be boring at all.</em></p><hr /><p>Barty met Hermione on the Knight Bus when it picked her up in Cokeworth, near the abandoned quarry. He was sitting in one of the rickety beds, hanging onto one of the poles that stretched from floor to ceiling with a white-knuckled grip and somewhat round, wide eyes.</p><p>"I think the ride has got worse," he mumbled to her when she wove her way down the aisle and to his side.</p><p>"Since the scratch you mean?" she asked, plonking down next to him. Neither had anything with them other than their wands, so Hermione wrapped her own hands around the metal frame of the bed and held on tight as the bus launched forward with a resounding <em>bang</em>.</p><p>The landscape around them blurred.</p><p>Barty nodded, a green tinge to his face. "I don't think moving vehicles agree with me."</p><p>"Try looking out at the horizon," suggested Hermione, wondering if Barty's partial lycanthropy was reminiscent of dogs in cars. Barty had gained some abilities - increased strength and senses - from the scratch, despite not becoming a full werewolf. It was enough that the pureblood was still scarred from the encounter, having grown up in a culture that vilified werewolves. Hermione was certain that he and Remus would never be friends, despite having quite a lot in common.</p><p>"Where are we getting off again?" he muttered, eyes firmly fixed on the blurry horizon.</p><p>"Seaford," replied Hermione, her voice low as she looked around the bus. While not full, there were still several people in various states of rest, some hanging onto bedposts like Barty, or those who were fully immersed and snoring loudly.</p><p>Barty frowned. "You're sure?"</p><p>Hermione nodded. "Regulus asked Kreacher to find the nearest town, and it's only an hour from London by train. Doable for seaside day trips."</p><p>Barty cut her a look, askance, at her knowledge but kept silent until their stop was announced. They ended up on a rural road, with only the ocean ahead of them and a few isolated cottages spread out atop a hill, overlooking the dramatic view. Behind them was a long stretch of grassy hills and the mouth of a shallow river that fed into the ocean. To their left, Cuckmere Haven jutted up and out from the ground with sheer cliffs.</p><p>"This isn't it, is it?" asked Barty, looking around with a twitch of his nose in distaste. "It's a bit barren and open. I don't see how a Dark Lord could hide a Horcrux here."</p><p>"It's not here," agreed Hermione, also looking around. She deeply inhaled the salty air. "But it's close. Can't you feel that?"</p><p>"Feel what?" Barty began to ask, but then paused and did as Hermione asked. He closed his eyes and slowly, he stilled. For a moment he was frozen, and then his eyes flew open. "That–"</p><p>"Let's start walking," suggested Hermione. They were early enough in the day regardless that they had the time, but Hermione didn't want to linger out in view of Muggles, wondering what two teenagers were doing out in a desolate park.</p><p>They walked the beach, toward the gap of the river, and then found the shallowest part to waddle across, getting the hems of their pants soaking wet. They kept walking, both silent, as they followed the hint of magic in the air. They passed the first cliffside, surrounded by squawking and cawing seagulls, for another hour before their passage was cut off by tumbling rocks breaking the beach. The cliff cut into the ocean directly, leaving them only one direction to go: up.</p><p>"We should've brought a broom," muttered Barty.</p><p>"Well, it's a good thing one of us did, then!" shouted a voice, thin and reedy.</p><p>Both looked up, Hermione's throat burning as she tilted her head all the way back. Several hundred feet above them, Regulus leaned over the edge of the white cliff. A smaller figure was next to him.</p><p>"Or he could just have his house-elf pop up us," muttered Barty – just as Kreacher appeared beside the wizard, making him shout and stumble back.</p><p>Hermione burst out laughing.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, laugh it up," the Ravenclaw sneered in her direction, but visibly shook off his fright by pulling on the bottom of his jacket - all three had gone in Mugglewear - as a reflex.</p><p>Kreacher glared at both Hermione and Barty balefully; Hermione was pleased to see that if there was one thing she hadn't affected, it was Kreacher, as the old house-elf - while not as old as she remembered from her time in the future - was just as misery as ever.</p><p>"Master Regulus says Kreacher must bring the halfbreed and mudblood to the top of the cliff," he began in a low, rumbling voice. His eyes darted between Barty and Hermione, almost flinching on her before moving back to Barty, who growled.</p><p>"Oi now!" he started, glaring at the elf, "Who're you calling a halfbreed and mudblood, elf?"</p><p>"That would be us," sighed Hermione. She rubbed at her forehead. "Barty, just take his hand. We've got a lot to do today."</p><p>Barty scowled at Hermione, making it obvious he was put out at her order but extended a hand for Kreacher to take. The elf did so with a matching scowl and then reached out with his other hand to take Hermione. Unlike Apparation, which was like being squeezed through a tube, house-elf transportation was more like squeezing through a tube while spinning uncontrollably.</p><p>Barty landed on his butt when they appeared at the top of the cliff, and Hermione teetered, trying to regain her balance.</p><p>Regulus politely waited until they both could focus on their friend. He was grim-faced though, pale and solemn as he stood with his hands in the pockets of an oversized black canvas jacket. Once he caught Hermione's eyes, he asked, "Can you feel it?"</p><p>She nodded, slowly. "It's close, isn't it?"</p><p>Regulus jerked his head. "About four hundred feet in that direction. Right in the middle of where the cliffs go straight into the water - and away from the beach. It looks like there was a passage to the cave at some point, but much of it was washed away."</p><p>Hermione leaned forward, eyeing the slick white rock that plunged straight down. There were a few tiny outcrops along the cliff face where birds had managed to make nests, but otherwise, it was bare - except for a tiny ledge that was washed back from years of erosion and the partially hidden gaping mouth that led into the cavern. Harry and Dumbledore had visited the cave during the late afternoon, during a storm; there was no way they would've seen it.</p><p>"How are we going to get down there?" asked Barty, kneeling on the springy grass beside Hermione as he too peered over the edge.</p><p>"Broom," answered Regulus. "Kreacher will bring me down there, but you two will take a broom."</p><p>Hermione made a face. She still wasn't fond of heights this time around, either.</p><p>Regulus withdrew a broom was a shoulder bag, which Kreacher enlarged. He handed it to Barty, the only other Pureblood of the group who had broom training while growing up and waited until Barty had straddled the broom and was hovering above the grass at the top of the cliff.</p><p>"C'mon, Hermione," he said, looking comically overly large on the broom, due to his height and lankiness. He jerked his chin over his shoulder. "On you get."</p><p>Hermione's mouth twisted but she gingerly swung one leg over the broom and settled near Barty's back, snaking her arms around his waist to clutch at his jacket tightly. "For the record, I hate this idea."</p><p>"For the record, I hate that the Dark Lord split his soul and we have to do this," countered Regulus snarkily, "But we're still here, aren't we?" He nodded at them both, Kreacher reaching up to take Regulus's hand with a miserable look on his pale grey, elfin face. "See you at the cave's mouth."</p><p>"Berk," muttered Barty, but slowly took the broom over the cliff's edge.</p><p>Hermione sucked in a sharp breath the moment the grass was gone from underneath her, leaving nothing but air for several hundred feet until the dark, cold, crashing ocean.</p><p>Although no Quidditch player, Barty expertly handled the broom in tight maneuvers, keeping them close to the cliff face but not so close that they were brushing up against the sharp rocks. Instead, their controlled descent meant that Hermione could marginally relax by the time Barty had them low enough to slip in parallel to the cave's entrance.</p><p>A sharp wind pushed at them and Barty eased the broom into the cave. Only the barest sliver of light reached the cave's mouth, leaving much of it in the dark. Hermione shivered as she slipped off the broom, glancing around warily.</p><p>Barty absently handed Kreacher the broom, his nose twitching as he reached a hand up to cover the lower half of his face. "Ugh, what's that smell?"</p><p>Regulus swallowed thickly, his Adam's apple bobbing in his throat as he croaked, "Dark magic."</p><p>Hermione's mouth tightened in a thin line as her arm began to throb with the reminder of something that never happened to her: the effects of Bellatrix's cursed knife had bled into her soul, leaving its mark and despite it never happening to Hermione <em>Evans</em>, Hermione <em>Granger</em> certainly remembered the sick, insidious feeling of it.</p><p>"Where - where first?" asked Regulus quietly.</p><p>"Forward," answered Hermione, a bare breathy reply. The three humans and one house-elf remained as silent as possible as they crept forward, letting only the lightest of touches guide them further into the cave.</p><p>Kreacher suddenly stopped. "Here," the elf said in his low, croaking voice.</p><p>He snapped, and a burst of light hovered above their heads, illuminating the small part of the cave which abruptly ended. However, there was a dull, blackish spot at waist height on a sharp outcropping.</p><p>Barty stared at it. "Is that <em>blood</em>?"</p><p>Regulus paled. "We need to make a blood sacrifice to enter?" He turned to face Hermione. "You didn't tell us that!"</p><p>Pale herself, Hermione retorted, "I didn't know!"</p><p>Kreacher did his best to slip into the shadows, away from the three teenagers as they awkwardly looked at each other, silently deciding what their next move would be. Inwardly, Hermione was cursing Harry for keeping this part of the night quiet and hidden from her and Ron, as the knowledge would've been useful to have.</p><p>Grimly, she knew that worse would come - so either Barty or Regulus would have to bleed for entry. Hermione cut an eye at Barty and then discounted him. His blood was no longer fully pure, diluted by Remus' lycanthropy. It would have to be - "Regulus. It has to be you."</p><p>The teen sighed, having already come to the same conclusion. "Very well."</p><p>"But–! Master Regulus!" protested Kreacher, staring up at Regulus in keen worry.</p><p>"It's fine, Kreacher," soothed Regulus, although his tone was resigned. "I won't hurt myself too much."</p><p>"And certainly not your palm," agreed Hermione. "I don't know why people slash their hands. You don't need to be dramatic about this; just a shallow cut on your arm or even your leg will do." She peered at the blackish mark of dried blood. "I think we just need to smear some of it here."</p><p>"That's better than I was thinking," sighed Barty, this time in relief. "I thought we'd have to sacrifice a cow or something."</p><p>"A Mudblood would be better," grinned Hermione, letting her smile and joking tone take the sting out of the slur. "That would be right up a Dark Lord's alley."</p><p>Barty snickered as Regulus took off his jacket and rolled up the sleeve of the jumper he wore underneath. He held his arm out toward Kreacher, who with a very sour look, pressed a thin, gnarled finger against his pale skin and then dragged it down. A line of blood bubbled up underneath and Regulus quickly twisted the arm over the old patch of blood.</p><p>The three watched, holding their breaths, as the blood dripped onto the rock. With each drop of blood, the rock hissed and spit until steam rose. The wall rumbled and bits of loose rock fell as a loud grinding sound emerged from the dead-end of the cave and the rocks parted.</p><p>Regulus drew back his arm and Kreacher immediately healed his master. This time though, his hand was shaking.</p><p>There was a pause, and then Hermione muttered, "Once more unto the breach, dear friends - once more," and she drew to the front of the group, stepping through the new entrance and into the darkness.</p><p>Barty scrambled behind her, just as Regulus called as he brought up the rear, "You know, the next line to that is 'Or close the wall up with our English dead', which might be a bit too on point for me right now!"</p><p>Hermione swallowed a laugh, despite being completely consumed by inky, black darkness of the inner cave. She stretched her arms on either side, touching the thin passageway and let her eyes adjust to the dark with each hesitant step forward and down until a pinprick of light turned into a massively large inner cavern.</p><p>The roof of the cavern was impossible to find - the cave disappeared into the darkness above and below, just steps from where Hermione emerged, was an eerie, black underground lake. Light did filter in through hidden shafts, bouncing off pale, milky stalactite that hung in sharp clusters from the ceilings and sides of the cave. Stalagmites, large, thick and murky brown, rose from the dark water, some wider than Hermione's entire body. The brown of the stalagmites and the off-milk colour of the stalactites above bounced the light around the cavern, but instead of lighting it up, it created a claustrophobic feel of the inside of a coffin: brown, confined, and very, very quiet.</p><p>Barty whistled as he emerged from the passage, and the whistle echoed. "Look at this place."</p><p>Regulus, as he appeared, dryly added, "Look at the boat."</p><p>Blinking, Hermione turned and realized it was easy to miss: a small, two-person dinghy bobbed gently in the still waters of the lake. It blended in well with the stalagmite it was moored against.</p><p>"We won't all fit," said Barty, inching forward and surveying the tiny boat. "Maybe Hermione and someone else, and your elf if he goes with you, but not all of us."</p><p>"Someone will have to stay here," sighed Hermione.</p><p>"Where are we supposed to take the boat, anyway?" asked Barty.</p><p>Regulus jerked his chin as Kreacher pressed against the back of his legs. "There. That island."</p><p><em>Island? </em>Hermione turned back to the lake and, moving to stand next to Regulus, saw the island. It had been partially hidden from her by a column of natural rock.</p><p>The island itself was small - again, barely large enough for two full adults to stand on comfortably, with an extravagantly carved crystal podium with a large, matching basin situated directly in the middle. Conveniently, a thin shaft of light from the ceiling bore down on the basin, highlighting it for all who ended up in the cave.</p><p>"Kreacher, what did the Dark Lord do when he came?" asked Regulus, turning and kneeling to face his elf.</p><p>Kreacher was now shaking, his bulbous eyes large and panicked as they darted around the cavern. He clutched at Regulus's arm. "Master must not go! Master must not drink!"</p><p>"The Horcrux must be in the basin then," surmised Hermione, moving to stand next to Regulus. "And one of us will need to drink the liquid in it to drain the basin. I doubt it'll be as easy as a simple <em>accio</em>."</p><p>"Or a smash-and-grab," muttered Barty as he walked toward them. "Although I am in favour of that."</p><p>Hermione, hands on her hips, turned to her friends. "Here's the plan: Regulus, Kreacher and I will take the boat to the island. Barty will stay here with the broom as backup. <em>I</em> will drink the liquid since this was my idea."</p><p>As both Regulus and Barty went to protest, Hermione raised her voice and continued speaking over them. "<em>And</em> Regulus has the most experience with Dark Arts out of the three of us. Kreacher listens to him only and has been here previously."</p><p>Barty scowled, crossed his arms, but turned his head away, indicating he wouldn't argue.</p><p>"You don't know what that in the basin could do to you," began Regulus slowly, staring at Hermione.</p><p>She shrugged. "You're right, I don't." <em>But I have an idea given how badly shaken Harry was when he told us how Dumbledore begged Snape to kill him.</em> "But I'm also a mudblood—"</p><p>"<em>Stop</em> calling yourself that!" snapped Barty.</p><p>"—and if something happens, it's better than it happens to <em>me</em>," she continued, ignoring Barty's furious face at her side, "than the son of the Head Auror," she nodded at her fellow Ravenclaw, "or the son of a Black," she finished, looking at Regulus. "As much as you two might disagree, I'm expendable."</p><p>"Not to us," muttered Regulus, a light spot of blush appearing on his cheeks as he glanced away. "You're our friend."</p><p>Hermione reached out and squeezed Regulus' hands, silently conveying her thanks. She waited until his grey eyes were on her again, and after holding the gaze for a moment, she then let go.</p><p>Kreacher unshrank the broom and passed it to Barty, sullenly and quietly, and then Hermione, Regulus, and Kreacher were in the small dinghy, trying hard not to rock the boat.</p><p>"Be careful!" admonished Barty as he paced the shoreline in a tight circuit, clutching at the broom's handle in a white-knuckle grip.</p><p>The boat began to move on its own toward the island and everyone fell silent.</p><p>When it bumped against the island, Hermione and Regulus stepped out together, Kreacher scrambling after them. As soon as the dinghy was empty, it began to float back across the black lake.</p><p>"Well, that's a problem," muttered Hermione.</p><p>"We could swim?" suggested Regulus, hope in his voice.</p><p>Hermione shook her head, kneeling and examining the crystal-like pedestal of the basin. There were intricate, almost delicate-like snakes coiling and spiralling upward and around skulls or wands – <em>Voldemort didn't really do 'subtle' well,</em> Hermione thought – but she was more concerned about the Inferi. How had Regulus originally died from them? Did the pedestal call them? Did they fall from the roof of the cavern?</p><p>"Hey – Hey guys?" called Barty from the shore. "Um – not to scare you or anything – but have you looked into the lake?"</p><p>Regulus turned and called back, "No! But we were thinking of maybe swimming back—"</p><p>"I wouldn't," replied Barty, a nervous lilt to his voice as it rose and cracked. "Because, um, yeah. So. There's dead people in the water?"</p><p>Regulus froze, then turned to face Hermione. She kept her face forward, toward the basin, despite feeling the heat of Regulus' eyes on her profile.</p><p>"You knew," he whispered at it. "You knew there were Inferi."</p><p>Hermione shrugged, rising to her feet. "Yeah, but I didn't know they were in the lake." She frowned and peered at the still waters, fighting back a shiver.</p><p><em>God, how terrible were Regulus' final moments?</em> She wondered, trying to imagine the young wizard at her side, frightened, terrified even, as he knew he was about to die; she tried to imagine him being dragged into the murky water by rotted, undead hands, and this time, Hermione did shiver. She turned her back on the lake and went back to facing the podium.</p><p>"Kreacher, can you conjure me a glass, please?" she asked, and although Kreacher did not have to obey her, he snapped a Black family goblet into existence, handing it to Regulus first.</p><p>Regulus did not pass it over. "Why can't we just grab at it?"</p><p>Hermione stared at him, and then without breaking eye contact, slammed her hand down. Had it connected with the liquid, it would've splashed up and soaked the wizard, but instead, her hand slammed into an invisible barrier that rippled and made a dull thud.</p><p>"Oh," he said quietly, grimacing. "It has to be all drunk to get to the Horcrux."</p><p>"Yes," replied Hermione, just as quietly. "Now you know why it has to be me. So… cup, please?"</p><p>With a sigh, Regulus extended the cup to her, but Hermione hesitated briefly before taking it from him. He quietly said, "It's not cursed, I promise."</p><p>"Thanks," she muttered and took the cup. She held it tight in her grip, letting it hover for a moment or two above the water of the basin, which sparkled in the filtered light. Wavering at the bottom of the basin, something silver glittered: Slytherin's locket.</p><p>Then, before Regulus could say anything, she took a deep breath – <em>you were once a Gryffindor, you can do this</em> – and submerged the goblet until it filled.</p><p>She extracted it and noted that the liquid inside was barely touched. Grimly, she said to Regulus without looking at him, "This is going to take awhile. If I ever want to stop – don't let me. No matter what I say, or what I try to do, Reg. <em>Don't let me stop</em>. Not until the last drop is gone."</p><p>Solemnly, Regulus nodded.</p><p>Hermione brought the goblet to her lips, paused, and then chugged the drink down.</p><p>At first, it was sweet – like honeyed syrup – and it slid smoothly down her throat. A part of Hermione even went, <em>see, this won't be so bad</em>, but then something curdled in her stomach as she refilled the goblet and brought the second cupful to her mouth.</p><p>The second taste was a bit bitter, like a fizzy drink that went flat, but still palatable, except for her stomach's roiling. The third was like cough medicine, and Hermione began to feel nauseous, like the contents of her stomach were going to come up.</p><p>By the fourth, Hermione was gripping the side of the basin tightly with her free hand and forcing herself to quaff down the magical potion as quickly as possible despite it beginning to taste like battery acid.</p><p><em>You can still walk away,</em> a sibilant voice hissed at her. <em>You don't need to drink anymore, Hermione. You can stop. You can stop at any time; no one is forcing you.</em></p><p>"Have to," muttered Hermione, her hand shaking as she dipped it in again to the basin, "Have to keep going."</p><p><em>No, no, you don't. Haven't you done enough? Sacrificed enough for the wizarding world? Sacrificed enough for </em>Harry<em>?</em></p><p>"Don't—don't bring Harry into this," she muttered angrily against the rim of the cup, squeezing her eyes shut and tilting her head back as she drank. It was vile going down her throat, thick and sludge-like, and Hermione coughed and choked, dribbles of liquid running down her chin and throat and into the collar of her shirt.</p><p>She dropped the goblet, and somewhere, distantly, she could hear Barty shouting something.</p><p>The voice didn't stop, though. <em>You gave this world everything when you were twelve. You never wavered from Harry's side. When is enough, enough? How many trolls, basilisks, dementors, werewolves, Death Eaters, giants – how many will be the one that makes you say, "no more"?</em></p><p>Hermione wheezed, her other hand gripping the basin tightly. None, she wanted to say, Never. Her mouth formed the words but "no more," breathed out.</p><p>"Hermione? C'mon Hermione, you need to drink," said Regulus, although he sounded far away. "I'm sorry, but you have to drink more."</p><p>The rim of the goblet was placed at her lips and a smooth hand curled around the back of her neck, supporting her head as the goblet was tipped and – with help – she began to drink more of the potion.</p><p>The voice roared in her ears, changing from playing on her Gryffindor tendencies – or saviour complex that she learned at Harry's side –, and around her, the shadows of the cave elongated and warped into vague shapes from her past – the future – into the figures she knew well.</p><p><em>LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME, HERMIONE, </em>roared Harry, his emerald green eyes dulling to hazel and then a warm amber. <em>YOU'RE KILLING ME.</em></p><p><em>YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU WERE SO CLEVER,</em> screamed Lavender, her throat shredded, <em>BUT WHERE WERE YOU WHEN GREYBACK SAVAGED ME AT HOGWARTS? WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL HIM WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE AT MALFOY MANOR?</em></p><p><em>DIRTY BLOOD, DIRTY WITCH,</em> declared Draco, sneering at her. <em>YOU'LL NEVER BE ANYTHING TO US. NOTHING YOU DO WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY HOUSE POINTS IF YOU'RE THE FIRST TO CAST A SPELL. YOU'RE STILL A MUDBLOOD.</em></p><p>Ron, looking confused, slightly lost, just stared at her like he didn't know who she was – and, maybe, she didn't. <em>I always knew who my friend was,</em> Ron said, shaking his head. <em>That was Hermione Granger. She always did what was right. What are </em>you<em> doing, Hermione </em>Evans<em>?</em></p><p>"I'm sorry," sobbed Hermione, salty tears streaking down her cheek as Regulus tried to shush her, patting her curly hair with his hand between forcing her to drink the potion, "I'm so sorry, Harry. I don't mean to!"</p><p><em>But you </em>want <em>to,</em> he hissed, sounding so disgusted, so snake-like, Hermione struggled to breathe for a moment. <em>You like James. You are going to go on a date with him. Couldn't stand to be considered the </em>second-best<em> Muggleborn witch? Thought to take my mum's place instead?</em></p><p>"Ron! Ron, please!" begged Hermione, turning her eyes on her other friend, but he shook his head and turned his back on her. "You know me! You do – I would <em>never</em>—!"</p><p>"Just a few more, Hermione, I promise," a tortured voice whispered at her side, but she barely heard them, barely knew who was standing next to her—</p><p>The voices began to run over one another, climbing higher and higher into a thundering crescendo that echoed around the cavern:</p><p>
  <em>You never did believe in me; you never believed in my creatures, why should anyone believe in you now</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You're stealing my life, I'll no longer be the son of Lily Evans</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Brilliant, but scary How about just scary</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I fought bravely at the Battle of Hogwarts – I killed the snake – I wore a burning hat – what diD YoU dO</em>
</p><p><em>WHAT DID YOU DO</em>—</p><p>"<em>Luna, Neville,</em>" moaned Hermione between gasping breaths and thick sobs, "Not you too, please, no—"</p><p>There was a loud <em>snap</em> and Hermione collapsed to her knees, fingers clawing uselessly against the crystal, leaving bloodied streaks from ripped nails as she tried to pull forward, reach toward Harry, the closest of her friends who was in a squat at the edge of the island, hands hanging between his knees as he stared at her with bright, almost gold-like eyes.</p><p>"It's the last one, Hermione," someone was saying, drawing her back against a warm chest and wrapping a tight arm around her chest to keep her upright. "C'mon, Hermione, one last drink, okay?"</p><p>"No, no!" Hermione twisted her head away as the rim of a cup came to her lips, nearly upending it. The person holding her was stronger, nudging he cup forcefully at her mouth, so Hermione clamped her lips together.</p><p>In return, they pinched her nose shut.</p><p>When she had to finally breathe, gasping, the cup was tilted down and bits of the potion spilled over the rim and into her mouth, making her sputter and choke. But it was done, and the person behind her disappeared, leaving her to curl up in a ball.</p><p>"I've got it!" they said, and then they shouted, louder, "Barty! I've got it! It's done!"</p><p>"Great!" a voice shouted back. "But what about Hermione? How's she doing?"</p><p>If she was Hermione – and she thought she was – then the answer was "not well," and she was more interested in staying curled into her ball than face the judgemental faces of her friends and family over her decisions in the war.</p><p>Something was happening around her, but she didn't lift her head or peer beyond the curtain of her thick, curly hair to see what was going on. Instead, she caught brief snippets of conversation and a loud <em>pop</em> of something disappearing via Apparation – or what she thought was – and mutters.</p><p>Someone strong hauled her up and she stumbled, her throat burning from her exhaustion, the purging of tears, and the potion she was forced to drink.</p><p>"Pease," she rasped, looking up at a familiar, black-haired and grey-eyed face, "water. Please, water."</p><p>"Not yet, Hermione," the teenager replied, eyes darting around, "Not until we're gone."</p><p>"Please!" she moaned.</p><p>But the teen shook his head and turned her, so she was facing away, at another familiar face and figure, gangly and all arms and legs hovering several feet above the island on a broom.</p><p>"Take her," the black-haired teen instructed, helping her as the other teen pulled her in front of him on the broom. Her legs dangled uselessly over one side while he clutched at her around her waist. She kept her eyes on the ground, not wanting to raise them to eye level and see Lavender and her ripped throat.</p><p>"What about you?" the broom-flying wizard asked.</p><p>"Kreacher will pop me to the shore. He just went back to return the goblet and bring some water for Hermione," the other replied.</p><p>Hermione felt something brush against the back of her head – maybe the teen nodded? And then they were flying, hovering above the inky, black lake. Hermione's eyes slid down and stared at the water, only to see it ripple and something move close to the surface: a pale, smooth face with vacant eyes, before it bobbed once, twice, and then sank back down into the dark waters.</p><p>Then they were at the shore of the underground cavern, away from the island, and the teen was helping her off the broom. A pop – which echoed – had her flinch and stumble away.</p><p>"It's okay, it's okay," the teen beside her soothed, catching her and drawing her into a hug. "It's just Reg and Kreacher."</p><p>"Water? Please?" begged Hermione, turning and keeping her eyes on the black-haired – Reg. <em>Regulus</em>, her mind supplied.</p><p>Regulus nodded and handed a new goblet to her, which she eagerly took and began guzzling until the front of her shirt was soaked.</p><p>Hermione's eyes closed and she sighed in happiness as the scratchiness in her throat began to ease. The voice in her head quieted, and each swallow and breath she took no longer hurt. But her limbs began to feel heavy and there was a pressing weight behind her eyes like a growing fatigue headache.</p><p>She blinked a few times as Regulus began to blur and double.</p><p>"Reg?"</p><p>"Hermione?" he replied, stepping closer.</p><p>"I don' feel so good," she slurred, swaying a bit. Behind her, Barty – <em>yes! Barty! He's here too!</em> – tightened his grip on her. "I think – I think – I think I'm gunna be—"</p><p>Whatever she was going to say, neither Regulus nor Barty would know. She immediately went limp in Barty's grip, unconscious, and it was only his heightened abilities and increased strength that kept her from hitting the rocky cavern floor.</p><hr /><p>The two wizards stared at her, and then each other.</p><p>"Well, we can't stay here," complained Barty, jiggling Hermione in his arms a bit to get a better grip before he finally hauled her up and into a bride's position.</p><p>"Right," agreed Regulus with a tight mutter.</p><p>With Kreacher leading the way this time, the group left the cavern and entered the tight, tiny passage with Barty keeping Hermione's feet and head away from the sharp walls; once they were back in the mouth of the cave, the clean scent of saltwater around them, did they stop and pause.</p><p>"I've got the Horcrux. We need to get somewhere safe," said Regulus, turning to look at Barty.</p><p>Barty shot Regulus a dirty look. "Of course. But where do you suggest?" His tone took on a mocking, sarcastic tint. "We can't take her to either of ours. <em>Your</em> mum would murder her for being who she is, and <em>my</em> father would murder <em>me</em> for bringing home a girl, looking like this!"</p><p>Regulus grimaced. "We can't take her back to her Muggle family like this, either—"</p><p>"<em>And</em>," added Barty, rolling his eyes expressively, "Merlin knows Potter would kill us if we showed up at Potter Manor–"</p><p>Regulus twitched, glancing down at Kreacher before looking at Barty. "I…" he began, hesitantly. "I… might know where we can go. To someone for help."</p><p>"Where?" asked Barty slowly, staring at his friend.</p><p>In response, Regulus began to fidget with the ends of his jacket sleeves, pulling at them nervously. "Do you trust me?"</p><p>"With my life," replied Barty immediately. He glanced down at Hermione in his arms. "And I trust you with hers, too."</p><p>Heat filled Regulus' cheeks and he puffed his chest out in pride. He glanced back at Kreacher again and focused on the long-faced house elf. "Kreacher. Can you take the three of us? I don't want to use a broom or the Knight bus for this."</p><p>Kreacher stared balefully at Regulus before glancing at Barty and Hermione. He then replied, clearly unhappily, "If Kreacher must."</p><p>"Then we're going to Muggle London," announced Regulus, carefully not looking at Kreacher or Barty. "Knightsbridge."</p><p>"Knightsbridge?" echoed Barty incredulously. "What's in Knightsbridge?"</p><p>Regulus did not reply, instead holding out his hand for Kreacher to take. The house-elf himself was scowling, an impressive sight on his long, grey-washed face that clearly stated his disgust.</p><p>With a grumble, the elf took Regulus' hand in one of his and then grabbed at Barty's leg, bunching the fabric.</p><p>"Oi, watch it—" Barty yelped and then was whisked away until the odd group appeared between two, towering red brick buildings, next to a white-framed window with drawn curtains blocking their arrival. He stumbled a bit with Hermione's extra weight but maintained standing, while Regulus took the time to thank Kreacher.</p><p>"Kreacher does not like this," he mumbled, "Kreacher does not like this at all, Master Regulus."</p><p>"You don't have to like it," replied Regulus loftily, "But you can keep it secret from Mother."</p><p>"Where are we going?" asked Barty, drawing Regulus's attention away from his house-elf.</p><p>The elf popped away, back to Grimmauld Place, leaving the magical teenagers alone in the darkened alleyway. The sounds of London – honking cars, a vague noise of people's voices, and even a few radios – reached them despite how far they were from the entrance.</p><p>"This way," instructed Regulus, leading Barty away from the entrance and further down the alley until they passed several well-kept flower boxes and stopped before a thin, nondescript metal door with some peeling paint.</p><p>Barty stared at it dubiously. "Where's this, then?"</p><p>"Barty," began Regulus, "Welcome to Black's Haberdashery."</p><p>The Slytherin turned his back on his friend and knocked on the door, in quick, perfunctory raps. He stepped back, drawing even with Barty and Hermione, and waited.</p><p>After a few moments, Barty began, "Well, this is very exciting—"</p><p>But the door swung open, outward. A tall man stepped out, lingering in the doorframe as he surveyed the three with one hand on the frame and the other tightly clutching his walking stick.</p><p>He had longish black hair, streaked with white, that was pushed back over his forehead rakishly, looking eerily like Sirius's favoured style and that complemented the Black wave. A well-trimmed beard mimicked his hair, although it was more grey than black. His eyes were a pale grey, piercing at them from under straight brows, and his nose was slightly crooked, to the right, like it had been broken and not set properly.</p><p>And although they were nearly a century out of style, the man was dressed entirely Muggle: he wore a dark purple velvet jacket over a matching vest, pinstriped with silver, and a lighter purple cravat in a fancy knot at his neck. Dark black trousers, thin in the leg and tailored straight with silver stripes that matched the vest added to his personal style.</p><p>The man's grey eyes widened as they lingered on Regulus, darting every so often at Barty and Hermione's unconscious form. "Reggie! I say! What are you doing here? It's been an age since I saw you last. In fact, I saw Sirius just the other week—"</p><p>A resigned look shuttered across Regulus's face, but he stiffened his shoulders, throwing them back a bit and said, firmly, "Uncle Alphard. I'm sorry to interrupt, but… well… We need your help."</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC...</p>

  <strong>July 1977</strong>
</p><p>Alphard ushered them in, only stepping back far enough for Barty to go first with Hermione still in his arms, and then for Regulus to enter. He looked up and down the alleyway before shutting the door, leaving the four in the tight, narrow and dark hallway.</p><p>"This way," he said with a frown on his face. He strode down the hall, his walking stick tapping rhythmically as he did so, although Regulus winced with each slap it made as it hit the concrete floor. His shoulders were tight with tension.</p><p>At the end of the hallway was a step of steep stairs. Alphard was already partially up when Regulus stopped at the foot, warily looking at the narrowed passage.</p><p>"Are you going to be able to carry Hermione up those?" whispered Regulus toward Barty, glancing back at him over his shoulder.</p><p>Barty eyed the stairs, scowled, but nodded, turning sideways and taking little hop steps as he went.</p><p>At the top was another metal door. Alphard's walking cane began to shrink until it was revealed to be his wand. Alphard tapped his wand against the door, and it swung in on silent hinges, revealing a bright, masculine waiting room. The walls were lined with dark maroon wallpaper; the floor was a dark hardwood - almost black - and at one end of the rectangular room stood a large fireplace with an elaborate, decorative iron grate at its mouth. Surrounding the fireplace were built-in wooden panels, in the same near-black colour as the floor. The decor was similar to Grimmauld Place, in Regulus' mind, with the Victorian trims and heavy on the wood.</p><p>Two large bay windows, framed by heavy velvet drapes, overlooked a quiet inner courtyard, filled with trees, shrubs, and flowering pots in a riot of colour. The light from the window bathed the dark room, creating a coziness that Grimmauld Place could never replicate.</p><p>"Place her on the couch," directed Alphard, waving a hand at one of the two long leather couches that faced each other, running perpendicular to the fireplace.</p><p>Barty did so, laying her gently down on the couch that faced one of the bay windows. He carefully arranged her limbs, ensuring nothing was out of place or at an awkward angle. He hovered at Hermione's head, kneeling beside the couch. Regulus stood at her feet, nervously biting at his lip and wringing his hands as his eyes travelled from Hermione's still form to his uncle.</p><p>Alphard, however, kept moving and went to the other end of the room, away from the fireplace. He crouched behind a long wooden wet bar, rummaging for a bit before finally sighing and summoning what he wanted, nonverbally.</p><p>An ice bucket - clinking the whole time with loose ice cubes - and towel came floating up and around the bar and toward Alphard, who directed it toward the two teenagers. Barty grabbed both items out of the air, tucking the bucket at his knees. The bucket was mostly cold water, and Barty immediately dipped a corner of the towel in and then began patting at Hermione's sweaty hairline and neck.</p><p>Stopping nearby, Alphard waited several long moments, silent. His eyes fixated on Regulus, who did his best to ignore his uncle's gaze and focused <em>his</em> eyes on his best friends.</p><p>Finally, Alphard cleared his throat and asked, "Regulus, m'boy, is there something you want to tell me?"</p><p>Panicked, both Barty and Regulus sent each other looks - which Alphard saw. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>"Well," began Regulus, eyes meeting his uncle's and then darting away, "the thing is-"</p><p>"Regulus. Don't insult my intelligence," began Alphard, his voice cool. "I want the truth. If you think I don't know what the effects of Dark Magic look like, then you are more of a fool than I'd ever have thought."</p><p>Regulus blanched.</p><p>Alphard moved to sit in a very large, square leather armchair by the second bay window, one of a matching pair with a table between them. He crossed one leg over the other, resting his wand in his lap and steepling his fingers together as he peered at the teenagers. In his dapper, Victorian outfit and set against the elegant but dark decor, Regulus had no trouble imagining his uncle as an 1800s gentleman, sitting in his private gentleman's club. In fact, a part of Regulus was waiting for his uncle to whip out a smoking pipe.</p><p>"I am a Black, Regulus," the man continued, raising a single eyebrow in emphasis. "I know Dark Magic. But what I'm more curious about, my boy, is how <em>that</em> girl reeks of it? Because unless I am mistaken, she's Muggleborn. And <em>Muggleborns </em>do not seek out Dark Magic - unless <em>someone</em> has cast it on them."</p><p>Now his other eyebrow rose to join the first, and his eyes flicked between Barty, who was slowly rising to his feet, to a frozen Regulus. "Now, I could tell you that it's entirely possible that you cast something on her-"</p><p>A noise of protest wrung itself from Regulus' mouth without his permission.</p><p>"-given what my brother Cygnus' daughters are up to," the elder Black continued, raising his voice just a smidge, "but I wouldn't want to put the Pegasus ahead of the cart, here." He levelled a straight, hard look at Regulus, and then at Barty. "So why don't you tell me what's going on?"</p><p>There was a hard look to Barty, like he was ready to gather Hermione up and fight his way out of Black's Haberdashery single-handedly and bare-fisted. He had even moved to stand in front of the girl on the couch, blocking her from Alphard's view.</p><p>"Just tell him," a thin, reedy voice groaned.</p><p>Regulus and Barty spun around. Barty gave a startled yip of, "Hermione!"</p><p>Hermione was trying to push herself up on shaky elbows, but the pale, green-tinge to her face and her closed eyes meant she was struggling; one elbow slipped out from under her and she fell back to the couch, a grimace of pain rippling across her face as she brought one hand up to shakily rub at her temples.</p><p>"A-Are you sure?" stuttered Barty, glancing nervously at Regulus.</p><p>Hermione's features pinched a bit more and she muttered out a terse, "Yes. Tell me." She forced her eyes to open; they were two narrow slits that focused - although blearily - on Regulus. "You still have it?"</p><p>"You remember?" blinked Regulus, shocked. "You were out of it-"</p><p>"I might not have been in the right headspace," she muttered crossly, "but I know what we were doing and where we were. If we're out and survived without being dragged to our deaths by the Inferi, I think we're okay-"</p><p>"<em>Inferi</em>!" sputtered Alphard, eyes wide as he jack-knifed up in his seat. "Regulus!"</p><p>The black-haired teen winced, eyes moving between Hermione, who was reclining back on the couch again, and his uncle. "Erm-"</p><p>"Do it," groaned Hermione.</p><p>Regulus sighed and, after running a hand through his hair in agitation, swung his bag around and reached in. He pulled out a bulky silk handkerchief, oddly wrapped and practically tossed it on the circular table between the two leather chairs.</p><p>"Be careful with that," he muttered, rubbing a hand around his mouth before glancing away.</p><p>Alphard frowned, looking between the three teenagers in his shop before shifting forward in his chair, turned toward the side table. He poked at the silk with his wand, murmuring revealing charms and counter curses under his breath. When nothing happened, he reached forward and unwrapped the silk, and then stared.</p><p>"Reggie - I say - Regulus - is this - is this what I think it is?" breathed Alphard, eyes wide.</p><p>Regulus took a few wobbling steps and all but collapsed in the other leather chair, while Barty warily sank into a crouch at Hermione's side, absently reaching for the towel and drinks bucket.</p><p>"If you're asking if it's a-"</p><p>"Slytherin's locket!"</p><p>Regulus blinked. "Well. Yes. But-"</p><p>Alphard frowned, looking around. "You went on an adventure, like a Gryffindor, for a Founders heirloom piece?" His frown deepened. "Reggie - I must say, chap, I wasn't expecting this-"</p><p>"It wasn't an adventure-" Barty began.</p><p>Regulus fought the urge to stamp his foot. "I'm <em>not</em> a Gryffindor, Uncle!" He paused and stared at Barty. "<em>That's</em> what you want to take away from this?"</p><p>Barty stared back. "What <em>is it</em> with you Slytherins and hearing 'Gryffindor' that automatically makes it an insult?"</p><p>"I-" Regulus pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes, turning away from the Ravenclaw of the group and back to his uncle. "It wasn't an adventure, Uncle Alphard."</p><p>"You found a lost artifact from a Founder, m'boy," said Alphard, his voice dry. "I'd say that's an adventure."</p><p>"Not when you're pretty sure you're going to die," muttered Barty, shifting so he was sitting cross-legged on the plush carpet beneath the couch.</p><p>"Well, there's usually an element of danger in an adventure-"</p><p>"You heard us, Uncle," sighed Regulus, "when we said <em>inferi</em>. Regular sixteen-year-olds don't encounter inferi on a daily basis, less so on adventures."</p><p>Alphard looked troubled. "True." He sat back from the locket, although his eyes kept straying toward it. "So what did happen?"</p><p>Barty looked steadily at Regulus, mentally nominating him as their designated speaker while Hermione remained on the couch, eyes closed and mouth drawn into a tight, pained line. One arm was crossed with the forearm over her eyes, blocking much of the light from the bay windows.</p><p>Regulus sighed. "It's… it's a horcrux."</p><p>Alphard stared at Regulus for a long, long moment. Then he painfully wheezed, "<em>Horcrux</em>?" while clutching at his chest as the colour drained from his face.</p><p>Regulus nodded mutely, a grim expression on his face.</p><p>Alphard turned back to stare at the locket, looking at it with new eyes. Sunlight bounced off the silver of the locket face, and Alphard shivered as the room suddenly felt much, much colder.</p><p>"How…?" he asked, his voice a low whisper, as he turned to look at the three teenagers.</p><p>With a thick swallow, Regulus began recounting Narcissa and Lucius' wedding and the meeting he was drawn into by Bellatrix and her husband. When he revealed that the Dark Lord wanted him to host something for him, he faltered, glancing at Hermione.</p><p>Alphard's eyes trailed to her. "I beg your pardon, but how does a Muggleborn know about horcruxes? And enough to recognize one?"</p><p>Without moving her arm, Hermione replied, her own tone dry, "I read a lot."</p><p>Barty snorted.</p><p>Moving her arm slightly, enough so she could peer from underneath it at Alphard, Hermione sighed and explained, "It's not the first horcrux I've seen."</p><p>Sensing she was not going to speak further, Alphard nodded slowly. "And you want to destroy this? To stop the Dark Lord?"</p><p>"Mmhmm."</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Yes, uncle."</p><p>The three positive responses threw Alphard for a loop, reeling him back into his chair as he blinked in surprise. Then, he leaned forward and tried again: "He's a <em>Dark Lord</em>. He's already begun killing people - if those disappearances are due to him. He has <em>followers</em>. And he's split his soul after committing a murder and a ritual so foul that no sane wizard would attempt it. And you - a group of sixteen-year-olds - think you can stop him?"</p><p>Regulus turned to Hermione, just as Barty did. Feeling their eyes on her, she opened her own and sighed. "It can be done. Not easily, but it can."</p><p>Barty beamed and Regulus turned back to his uncle with a determined look, jaw firmed and jutting out just so in stubbornness.</p><p>Alphard shook his head, then brought a hand up to clutch at his beard. "There are only two documented ways to destroy a horcrux-"</p><p>"Basilisk venom and Fiendfyre," interrupted Regulus. "Yes, we know."</p><p>"Yes. Right. Well," sputtered Alphard, "One is hard to obtain and the other takes mental strength-"</p><p>"We have the venom," spoke up Barty, with a slight curl to his lips that made him look rather smug. "We've had it since just after Yule."</p><p>Alphard stared at them. "Well. Well then. Is there anything you actually need from <em>me</em> then?"</p><p>"They fight back," said Hermione from the couch in a tired voice. Her face was pale, but she was slowly sitting up, pressing down hard on Barty's shoulder to haul herself up. Against his solid form and increased strength, she barely made a dent or shove at him. "They know when they're being destroyed. Having more wands on hand to step in, so to speak, is a good idea."</p><p>Something passed across Alphard's face as he stared at the girl in the group, but he nodded all the same.</p><p>"Yes," he said, his voice low, "Yes, I can see how that would be important."</p><p>He took some time to survey the three teenagers, before expelling a long, low breath of air. He slapped his hands against his knees with some sort of finality to the movement. Clutching his wand, he stood from the chair. There was something hard in his eyes, in the lines that pulled at the corner of his mouth and eyes.</p><p>"Very well, Regulus," the older Black said, and then looked at Barty and Hermione to include them. "Very well. You have my help. Whatever you need, whatever I can provide. My wand; my life if it comes to it. I am here."</p><p>Relief spread across Regulus' face at the pronouncement and he nearly sagged in on himself in the armchair. "Thank you, Uncle Alphard," he muttered, reverently. "Thank you."</p><p>Something softened in the man's face as he stared down at his nephew. "Of course, Reggie." He cleared his throat, turning to the couch. "Now - how about you introduce me to your two friends, and we find a room for this young lady to rest in? You'll need some potions to purge whatever you ingested, and somewhere quiet to rest."</p><p>"Uncle, may I introduce my best friends, Bartemius Crouch Junior, son of Bartemius and Winifred; and Hermione Evans?" grandly said Regulus, standing and making some type of sweeping gesture as he did so.</p><p>Alphard nodded at Barty and gave Hermione a much deeper dip of the head, but there was a strange, inquiring look on his face at his nephew's choice in friends: the son of the Head Auror and a Muggleborn!</p><p>"Come, Miss Evans," began Alphard, moving toward the couch as Barty stood from the floor, helping Hermione to her feet. "I have a small annex room you can use where I've had clients - or even, I must admit - myself! Have chosen to sleep when amidst a project."</p><p>As he wove down the far side of the room, opposite the grand fireplace, he led the teenagers through a short hallway with many closed doors until he opened one, revealing a tiny, overfilled room. There was a single bed piled with pillows, a circular stained glass window high above it, and several shelves along the opposite wall overflowing with mismatching jars of buttons, needles, thread spools, and coloured chalk; crates of oddly-shaped cloth, along with several wrapped bolts of cloth in different fabrics precariously leaning against one another; and a mannequin with an unfinished smoking jacket in honey yellow with black, jagged lines and an unrolled white measuring tape draped across its shoulders.</p><p>"It's not much, my dear," began Alphard apologetically, almost flushing at the appearance of the busy room, "But it'll do for now."</p><p>He did some discrete swishes with his wand and some of the bolts of cloth rearranged themselves to be neatly stacked, but that was about all that happened. He sighed.</p><p>"It's wonderful," sighed Hermione, letting Barty lead her to the bed, and to which she gratefully slipped out of his grasp and onto the squishy mattress. "I could use a kip."</p><p>"We'll wake you up in a bit," agreed Regulus.</p><p>"Yes, you'll need to take some rather horrendous potions, I'm afraid," added Alphard.</p><p>Hermione shrugged and Barty drew up a blanket for her. "S'fine."</p><p>"Should we owl anyone, Hermione?" asked Barty in a faux whisper, staring down at her worriedly as he chewed on a lip.</p><p>Struggling to stay awake, Hermione blinked and mumbled, "Maybe 'Tuney? S'pose to meet with James l'ter…"</p><p>"Okay," whispered Regulus, doing a better job and sending Barty a glare when he went to open his mouth. "We'll owl Petunia for you to create some sort of cover. Just sleep now."</p><p>"Okay…"</p><p>Then she was out, gently snoring.</p><p>Alphard had already turned and walked back to the main lounge, leaving Barty and Regulus staring at their sleeping friend.</p><p>"I'll owl Petunia," offered Barty, "Since we already know each other."</p><p>Regulus nodded. "What will you say?"</p><p>"That Hermione got a bit injured and needs magical help to recover but it's nothing serious," he said, then glanced wide-eyed at Regulus. "You don't think it <em>is</em> serious, do you?"</p><p>"Uncle Alphard would've said so," replied Regulus. Then he frowned. "Well, I hope he would, anyway…"</p><p>Barty, however, was now looking around the small room and was gently fingering the honey yellow smoking jacket. "This is nice! I didn't know you had an uncle that worked."</p><p>Regulus scowled. "It's a side project. Blacks don't work-"</p><p>"This haberdashery would say otherwise-"</p><p>"It's a <em>hobby</em>-"</p><p>"I really think it's not; I mean, did you <em>see</em> the effort and quality put into this jacket? D'you think your uncle will make one for me?" Barty grinned at Regulus, wiggling his eyebrows.</p><p>Regulus' scowl deepened. "No."</p><p>"Oh, c'mon, Reggie!" wheedled Barty, turning to face his friend fully. "It could be, like, my superhero costume." His eyes lit up and he mock gasped. "D'you think <em>we're</em> superheroes now, like that Batman on the Muggle telly? Or Superman?"</p><p>Regulus stared at him. "Don't. Please, for the love of Merlin, <em>don't</em>."</p><p>"What-" Barty nudged him in the shoulder. "-Don't fancy the idea of wearing tights and fighting crime with a secret identity?"</p><p>"Of course bloody not!" he snapped, then guiltily shot a look at Hermione, who moved on the bed but remained asleep. "By doing this, by throwing my lot in with you and Hermione, I'm <em>marked</em>, Barty! If he finds out-"</p><p>"He won't," argued Barty confidently, "Hermione'll never let that happen-"</p><p>"He might, and I'll have to join!" retorted Regulus, "And you heard what Hermione said: he <em>marks</em> them, like a brand-"</p><p>"That won't happen," repeated Barty, his voice low and eyes fixated on his friend. "Hermione won't let that happen. And <em>I</em> won't let that happen. You won't ever <em>have</em> to join him."</p><p>Regulus let out a watery, wobbling laugh that was half a choked sob as he raised a hand and ran it through his hair. "Merlin, I hope so. I really hope so."</p><p>The two fell silent. Then, Regulus said, quietly, "She knew about a lot of the things in the cave."</p><p>"Did she?" replied Barty, his voice deceptively light.</p><p>"She knew about the inferi," continued Regulus, watching Barty carefully. He knew something, Regulus was sure of it. "And she said the Dark - that, erm,<em> he</em> - has seven horcruxes."</p><p>"Okay, so?" rebuffed Barty, but he had turned his body and eyes and was facing the mannequin and not looking at Regulus.</p><p>"How?"</p><p>Barty shrugged. "Why don't we think about how many of the horcruxes we can get and destroy before this all goes tits up and we die a very long and painful death?"</p><p>Regulus stared, and he knew Barty knew at the stiffening of his shoulders. "I thought you said Hermione won't let that happen."</p><p>Barty spun around, a wide smile on his face that didn't reach his eyes. Yet the smile was frail, fake, and Regulus' heart clenched at the sight of it.</p><p>"She won't," the Ravenclaw confirmed. While the words were confident, the tone wasn't, and Regulus knew, deep down inside, that things were going to change in ways he couldn't predict. The thought worried him, even as they left Hermione to sleep in the room and went back to the lounge to speak to Alphard.</p><p>He looked up from his place in front of the lit fireplace, having been staring into the flames in thought. "Is she sleeping?"</p><p>Barty nodded and Regulus went to sit wearily on the couch Hermione had vacated. Barty sat next to him, hands hanging between his knees.</p><p>"There's parchment and ink on the bar, lad," instructed Alphard, jerking his head toward the item. "For you to send an owl."</p><p>Barty mumbled his thanks and got up, hastily scribbling something on the parchment with some pauses of deep thought regarding what he wanted to convey to Petunia. When he was done, he blew on the ink for it to dry and waited until it soaked in to fold the parchment in two and then rolled it up. He looked curiously at Alphard for the next step.</p><p>"My owl is back through the hallway, and on the third door on the left. You'll find her amiable enough to carry the letter."</p><p>After Barty left, Alphard waited a moment, then cleared his throat. "Your friend wasn't what I was expecting, Reggie."</p><p>Regulus stared at his uncle. "Oh?"</p><p>"Well, I mean, I never expected you to be friendly with a -" he broke off, clearing his throat again. He fiddled with his wand-turned-walking cane, rolling it between his two hands. He glanced nervously at his nephew.</p><p>"Friendly with a mudblood you mean?" he asked, narrowing his eyes and crossing his arms.</p><p>"I didn't say that, m'boy," retorted Alphard, affronted.</p><p>Regulus said, pointedly, "You implied it."</p><p>"Yes, well." He looked away again from his nephew's pale eyes. He tried a different conversation route. "It's strange that she knew so much about horcruxes. Muggleborn don't know about that kind of magic."</p><p>"I know," agreed Regulus. His mouth pulled down into a frown. "She won't say how."</p><p>With a glimmer of humour in his voice, Alphard suggested, "Maybe she's a seer."</p><p>Regulus snorted. "She hates divination. <em>Loathes</em> it."</p><p>"It would be a good cover story." Alphard wiggled his eyebrows. "Think about it, m'boy - she says she hates the subject, but secretly is a seer. It's to protect her-"</p><p>"Hermione can lie and act," began Regulus, "But I've known her too long to fall for<em> that</em>."</p><p>"Hmm. So you say."</p><p>"I do so say."</p><p>The two fell into silence. Then, Alphard began, "Who's this James she mentioned?"</p><p>"Merlin, you're such a gossip," sighed Regulus, rolling his eyes.</p><p>"Well, how else am I supposed to stay involved with the magical world, Reggie?" asked Alphard. "I get all my information from those I tailor-"</p><p>"I <em>knew</em> this was a cover," muttered Regulus under his breath. "Ha! Take <em>that</em>, Barty!"</p><p>"-and this is something new and exciting for me," continued Alphard blithely, undeterred from Regulus' interruption. "So. Who is this James, hmm? Your rival for her affection?"</p><p>Regulus reeled back, eyes wide. "What? Me and <em>Hermione</em>? Uncle - Merlin! No. <em>No!</em> Just - no." He shook his head. "What a terrible idea - no, no."</p><p>"I concur," added Barty's prim voice as he re-entered the room from the hallway. "And James is James Potter."</p><p>Alphard's eyebrows disappeared under his curly fringe. "<em>Potter</em>? Dorea and Charlus' son?"</p><p>Barty nodded, his brows furrowed.</p><p>"Well now," murmured Alphard, stroking his trimmed beard thoughtfully.</p><p>"Well now, what?" asked Regulus, slowly uncrossing his arms. Barty moved to join him on the couch.</p><p>"The circles were saying that the young Potter was interested in a witch named Lily," began Alphard slowly. "Several ladies were quite upset - you know how they get when a young, eligible wizard seems to show interest in someone, not their daughters-"</p><p>"Lily is Hermione's sister," replied Barty with an edge to his voice as he began to slouch against the cushions. Regulus shot him a glare that plainly said <em>shut up you fool</em>, but Barty was falling into his misery and missed it completely. "Hermione's been tutoring Potter in Arithmancy since we were in fourth year-"</p><p>"<em>Barty!</em>" hissed Regulus.</p><p>"-although she had been trying to avoid him and his friends for <em>years</em>," he continued, wrapped up in his own emotions and memories. "That did change with the huge blow-up at the end of last year and that was the end of Potter's interest in Lily."</p><p>A hand strayed to Barty's side, fluttering and holding there. Regulus' eyes were drawn down by the movement, and underneath Barty's jumper, Regulus knew he still bore the silvery scars from Remus' transformed werewolf self, a lingering reminder of that night.</p><p>A gleam in Alphard's eyes had Regulus sit straight. "How <em>interesting</em>."</p><p>"It's not," argued Regulus, almost hastily. "It's really not."</p><p>But Regulus could already see it, the turning wheels in Alphard's mind: a strange Muggleborn girl with knowledge of the darkest of Dark Arts and magics, who had tried to avoid certain people for years on end until she suddenly didn't, who knew things she should <em>never</em> know -</p><p>Regulus' heart sank into his stomach. He wasn't sure what Hermione was - a seer, or just a genius, or something else - but he knew that his uncle would draw conclusions from the information he gathered. And a good Black favoured information in order to maintain control of everything, at all times. Like Regulus told Hermione and Barty: if they couldn't <em>buy</em> someone with the blackmail material they knew, then a Black would destroy.</p><p>Alphard just wasn't sure yet which Hermione category belonged to.</p><p>"Well, m'boy," said Alphard, turning to Regulus while Barty sulked. "I am happy to help you and your friends in whatever way I can. Horcruxes are-" He shuddered "-no trifling thing to mess around with! And you, lad, while a diligent student at your father's knee, still have much to learn. And I can help with that."</p><p>"Thank you, Uncle Alphard," said Regulus hesitantly, eyeing his uncle. Blacks <em>never</em> just offered their help. Even Barty seemed to realize that there was more to the exchange as he glanced curiously between the two. "What do you want?"</p><p>Alphard innocently blinked, bringing a hand to his chest. "<em>Me?</em> M'boy - Reggie - I'm here to help! I am no fan of the Dark Lord and destroying his horcrux is something that <em>must</em> be done. But-"</p><p>Regulus and Barty froze. "But?"</p><p>"But I certainly wouldn't mind being kept in the loop, so to speak," continued Alphard, looking down at his nails. "So perhaps you could come by every so often and we could have a proper chinwag, what do you say, Reggie? Hmm? A catch up between your favourite uncle and his favourite nephew."</p><p>"Sirius was always your favourite," muttered Regulus darkly, too quiet for anyone other than Barty to hear at his side, but louder he said with a tight smile, "Of course, Uncle Alphard."</p><p>"Excellent." But the smile on Alphard's face was all teeth.</p><p>The man then began talking about someone who frequented his haberdashery - a Selwyn by the sound of it - but Barty leaned across the empty space between the two of them and whispered, "What did you just agree to?"</p><p>"For his help and silence," began Regulus in a whispered reply, a grim tone to his voice, "I sold us. Information about us."</p><p>Barty's mouth tightened, too. "Well, shit. Is there anyone we can trust?"</p><p>"Oh, we can trust him," argued Regulus quietly, "But only so far as the next Black."</p><p>Barty turned his brown eyes on his friend. "But we trust you. Shouldn't that mean something?"</p><p>"Maybe with Sirius; perhaps even Andromeda," finished Regulus darkly, "But not with the rest of the family." He turned to focus his icy eyes on Barty. "And given <em>his</em> interest, maybe not even me, Barty."</p><p>Barty leaned back on the couch with a long, low exhale, shivering a little.</p><p>Both teens sat in silence as Alphard continued to speak, oblivious to them, lost in their own thoughts.</p><hr /><p><strong>Late July</strong> <strong>1977</strong></p><p>There were some days when Hermione really felt the time difference. Between living in the 2010s - even working at the Ministry - and living between both the Muggle and Magical worlds in the 1970s, there were enough jarring differences but the one that stood out the most to her, beyond the floppy haircuts and corduroy, were the vehicles.</p><p>Hermione leaned against the thin strip of the brick exterior of the Leaky Cauldron, not quite near the wooden door entrance to the pub, but rather closer to the shiny large window of the Muggle bookstore to its right. Charing Cross was busy, with several delivery trucks parked along the two-lane road blocking passing traffic if the noise from the honking horns were any indication.</p><p>She was watching the cars in fascination, barely remembering the boxy, square designs of her youngest years as Hermione Granger growing up in the early 80s and her parents' large and long Vauxhall in maroon. She was definitely feeling a sense of dissonance and the sleek designs favoured in the 2010s, partially due to the technological devices built into the system.</p><p>It was because she was so amused, heavily invested in a screaming match between a parked delivery driver and a man who emerged from the shop, that she failed to realize James had arrived through the Leaky Cauldron door and was watching the impressive hurl of insults as vividly as she was.</p><p>Finally, he whistled, impressed.</p><p>Hermione swore under her breath, jumping as she spun toward him. A hand pressed against her collarbone, where she rubbed it anxiously. "Don't do that!"</p><p>"Sorry. Have you been waiting long?" James grinned, hands in his pockets. He had done well, dressing up Muggle, although it was a bit fancier than what others wore. He wore dark trousers and a button-up shirt tucked into his trousers, but wore a waistcoat on top of that and carried a matching jacket. He looked more like the teenage son of a businessman going to a fancy dinner party than a date.</p><p>"Long enough to have seen how that," she tilted her head to the screaming match, "began."<br />"Oh?"</p><p>"It's the driver's fault," she confided, leaning close toward James, peering up at him as she moved into his personal space. She watched as his pupils dilated, his mouth parting just the tiniest bit. Then, James blinked, rocking back.</p><p>"G-Good to know," he croaked, then cleared his throat.</p><p>She grinned, pleased.</p><p>"So, um, so," stuttered James, looking around and then bringing a hand up to run through his hair, "Are we doing it - I mean - what are we doing - <em>going</em>! Where are we going!"</p><p>Hermione kept her mouth tightly pressed to avoid laughing at James as his face turned bright red. Without calling attention to it - as he was already far too aware - Hermione asked, "Are you hungry? Have you eaten?"</p><p>Glumly, James admitted, "I don't think I could eat. I'm too nervous."</p><p>With a gentle smile that did not betray how fast her heart was beating, Hermione held out her hand and wiggled her fingers. "How about we go for a walk then?"</p><p>James stared down at her hand, and she wiggled her fingers again in invitation. He looked up, a slow, confident smile stretching across his face as he slipped his warm hand in hers. "Okay. Lead the way."</p><p>It was clear that James wasn't too well versed in Muggles or Muggle lifestyle, as his head swivelled this way and that at whatever captured his attention: cars, the red double-decker buses with tourists, the large, flashing lights of advertisements, even the fashion displayed in some shop windows made him goggle. At one point, when they were going to cross the street, Hermione had to reach out and stop James from stepping onto the road against their walk signal and from getting splattered by a car.</p><p>It didn't stop him from asking questions, though, and they spewed out of him like water from a tap. Hermione was happy to answer what she could or direct him to a library for more information that she didn't know.</p><p>"I think a part of me always thought, <em>ooh, Muggles</em>, you know?" said James, slightly shame-faced.</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "There are times I think that way about magic, too. Like, <em>oh, that's nice</em>, when I see a spell, and my mind automatically goes to a non-magical equivalent."</p><p>James paused. "Was that… was that what Lily was referring to, you think?"</p><p>"About me not seeing the wonder in magic?" confirmed Hermione. She gave another shrug. "Maybe. It's just… yeah, magic is wonderful, but it can also be terrible. It's hard to see it as this amazing cure-all or something exotic and different the way that Lily does when I do, and I will admit, see it as a tool. My magic, and my wand, are no different to me than a chef's knives, or a painter's brush. How I <em>wield</em> my magic determines my interaction with it."</p><p>James went silent as he thought about what she said, and it was a pleasant silence. As they continued their walk, they found a stall selling ice cream and bought one each. Hermione licked at her vanilla ice cream, waiting for him to speak.</p><p>"Then…" he hesitated, glancing at her.</p><p>She nodded encouragingly.</p><p>"That day… in Diagon Alley," he began carefully, looking at his own ice cream hard. "And before - the <em>incident</em> at school - your magic - it was - you didn't use a wand-"</p><p>"Yeah," sighed Hermione, looking at her own ice cream. She wondered when that would come up - and James had seen her, and been with her when she used transmutation twice. "I didn't use my wand."</p><p>"Was it accidental?" he asked.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "No," she began quietly. "No, I was… I've been experimenting at school. I had some ideas about magic, about how we use it - and well, you saw what happened."</p><p>"That was wandless magic, Hermione," he said quietly, glancing at her as the frame of his glasses slipped down his nose a bit. "That's really… <em>really </em>impressive. Not many have the magical strength and ability to do it."</p><p>"You mean it's impressive for a mudblood," she replied with an upturn of her lips.</p><p>James immediately stopped, staring at her. He then chucked his ice cream, unfinished, into the nearest rubbish bin (although it was quite far, and while Hermione could attribute it to her Quidditch skills, she was sure some accidental magic was at play).</p><p>Once his hands were free, he gripped Hermione's upper arms, tight enough to demonstrate his feelings on the matter, and staring into her eyes, he said, forcefully, "Don't <em>ever</em> call yourself that!"</p><p>Hermione blinked. <em>Oh</em>.</p><p>She had forgotten; this wasn't Barty and Regulus, who were used to her brand of gallows humour, of calling herself a mudblood because the insult meant <em>nothing</em> to her anymore. This was James Potter, who hated Dark Magic, and the things that Dark wizards and witches stood for.</p><p>"It doesn't mean anything to me," said Hermione quietly, looking up at James, one hand still clutching her ice cream, which was now dripping down her hand. "It's a word. A word that others attribute certain things and qualities to - which I don't agree with. But I understand it bothers you. I won't say it, even in a joking manner."</p><p>"Good." James exhaled heavily through his nose.</p><p>He let go, his jaw jutting out just a bit as a muscle ticked in his cheek, indicating his anger and unhappiness at the word. His hands were clenched into fists.</p><p>"Sorry," she said again, using her free hand to touch his shoulder.</p><p>He nodded, glancing at her from the corner of his eye. His hands unclenched, flexing as he worked the muscles.</p><p>They were a bit silent as they continued walking. Hermione absently licked at her hand, getting the melted ice cream, and then meandered a bit away to throw out the remains. She returned to his side and they kept walking silently until they ended up in St. James' park, mingling with the other couples and families as they walked the promenade along the lake. They stopped at the Tiffany Fountain, watching the pelicans and ducks.</p><p>"I've grown up hearing people use that word," he said, suddenly.</p><p>Hermione turned to face him.</p><p>He wasn't looking at her, but rather the ducks as they quaked and swam in circles, playing in the waters. "I was always aware of what it meant, that there was a difference between us and - and <em>them</em>, witches and wizards who were different and othered because they didn't grow up knowing magic like I did. But then I went to Hogwarts and realized it was shite, it was all shite. My dad never said the word, but sometimes my mum did-" He winced and added, quickly, "She's a Black, she was raised in a Dark family-"</p><p>"I know," said Hermione, a bit bewildered and wondering where this conversation was going.</p><p>"Yeah… but then I met Lily, and Phoebe, and Biggs, and Denby, and the other Muggleborn in Gryffindor and realized that my entire worldview was narrow and influenced by only a tiny pocket of my life," he continued, licking his lips nervously.</p><p>He turned to face her now. "You're no different to me, Hermione." Then, he laughed, ducking his head and running his hand through his hair. "Actually, you're kind of better at things than I am-"</p><p>"That's not true," she argued immediately. "You're a transfiguration prodigy, and you're top in your other classes. I'm pretty sure Arithmancy is just an outlier of a subject-"</p><p>"That's not the point!" James shook his head. "What I'm trying to say - badly - is that when it comes to magic, whether you're muggleborn, or halfblood, or pureblood - I didn't see a difference. There was no difference. And to hear you - who is so amazing at what she does - call yourself that, that <em>word</em> - it just boiled my blood."</p><p>Hermione's mouth dropped open, a bit breathless as he spoke, catching her eyes.</p><p>"It's meant to knock you down, make you feel inferior and worse, to let you know you're not included in our world." James snorted, rolling his eyes. "If there's anyone who is more deserving, if I should ever use that word, of magic… it's you. So… don't. Don't use that word. You're not inferior, or not welcomed to magic in any way."</p><p>He stepped closer to her until the tips of their shoes were touching. He slowly raised a shaking hand and pushed some hair away from her eyes, tucking it behind her ear.</p><p>James' eyes darted back to hers, then her lips, and her eyes again, asking wordless permission even as his head dipped closer. His nose slid along hers and soon they were sharing the same breath even as he hovered over her lips.</p><p>"You," he whispered, "Are magic itself."</p><p>Hermione wasn't sure if she stood on her toes to reach him, or if he dipped his head low enough, but the next thing she knew, his lips were pressed against hers, warm and soft. He tasted of chocolate ice cream with a minty hint.</p><p>His hand cupped her cheek, and Hermione leaned into it and him, pressing her chest against his. He made a noise in his throat and tugged her closer, slanting his head and deepening the kiss.</p><p>A rough cough and a scandalized "Oh my!" from an elderly couple walking by had the two of them breaking apart. Hermione and James glanced at them as they walked past, eyeing the two teenagers with dark, horrified looks.</p><p>Hermione caught James' eyes and they both immediately began laughing.</p><p>Her cheeks were flushed and her lips tingled. James' cheeks were a bit red and his lips redder, but there was a sparkle in his hazel eyes.</p><p>James touched her cheek gently with his fingertips. "We good?" he asked quietly, still standing close to her with one arm around her waist.</p><p>Hermione smiled and nodded. "We're good," she replied, just as quietly.</p><p>He sighed, a long, happy sound. "I've been… uh, wanting to do that. For some time."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>He nodded. "Yeah."</p><p>"Well, I'm glad you did," said Hermione, withdrawing from his embrace but not too far - his arm remained around her waist, warm and solid. "It was quite good."</p><p>"Quite good? <em>Good</em>?" squawked James, blinking at her. "C'mon Evans! Really? I'd rate that at <em>least</em> at spectacular, myself."</p><p>Hermione grinned. "Eh, maybe we can upgrade it to pleasant."</p><p>"What?!" James' mouth dropped open, and then his eyes took on a devilish gleam. "Oh, you're asking for it-"</p><p>His hand at her waist dug into her side, fingers moving and Hermione <em>squealed</em> when they hit a ticklish part. She wiggled up against his side and then danced away from him even as he laughed loudly and chased her.</p><p>The two dodged people, laughing until they breathlessly called a truce and collapsed on a park bench, chests heaving and flushed in happiness.</p><p>"So…" began James, nervously, glancing at Hermione.</p><p>"So…?" she mimicked, rolling her head to the side and along the back of the bench to look at him at her side. He was tugging at the bottom of his shirt.</p><p>"This has been a good date, right?"</p><p>"Yeah," sighed Hermione, bringing her head back to face forward. She tipped it up to look at the sky, feeling the warmth of the sun on her face. She shut her eyes. "It's been fantastic."</p><p>"Fantastic?" echoed James, a hint of something in his voice.</p><p>"Mmhmm," replied Hermione, still not looking at him. He'd get to what he wanted soon enough.</p><p>He shuffled a bit on the bench, turning to face her. At the noise, she opened her eyes and turned to look at him, as well.</p><p>"Enough that, um, maybe, you'd uh, want to go on another?" he asked nervously, ruffling his hair.</p><p>"Um, maybe, uh, yeah," teased Hermione with a smile.</p><p>James closed his eyes, slightly embarrassed, but a grin on was his face as well. "Yeah?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>They were grinning goofily at each other, completely besotted. When he realized what he was doing, James cleared his throat and tried to force the smile off his face, but it was difficult.</p><p>"So, how about that food?" he asked.</p><p>Hermione blinked at the change in topic. "What?"</p><p>"Well," he began, reaching into a pocket in his waistcoat and extracting a pocket watch that should not have been able to fit into the tiny slit without the aid of magic. He popped open the watch, checking the time. "It's nearly six. The ice cream just whetted my appetite, really, now that I'm not as nervous as I was at lunch."</p><p>"Nearly six?!" Hermione stood from the bench abruptly. "Shit, I promised to meet Tuney!"</p><p>James paused. "Your sister gave you a curfew for our date?"</p><p>Morosely, Hermione nodded. "I'm staying with her right now, and she's a bit of a stickler for things."</p><p>Together, they left the park at a quick pace. Hermione seemed to know where she was going, so James followed along. At first, they kept their distance with her fast stride, but then James reached forward and hooked his fingers around hers and pulled her back to him until their fingers were laced and he slowed her walk.</p><p>"If you're late now, you're already late whether you're running or walking," he said, raising his eyebrows as she huffed. "Let's just enjoy this."</p><p>"Very well," she replied, but she tightened her grip around his, and he smiled.</p><p>Petunia was walking for them at Trafalgar Square, part of the evening crowd enjoying the summer night. She sat on the edge of the fountain and a large, burly looking man who was <em>not</em> Sean was speaking to her. She seemed to know him, but Hermione frowned nonetheless.</p><p>"Is that her boyfriend?" asked James as they ambled up.</p><p>"No…" said Hermione slowly. "I've never seen him before."</p><p>Soon they were close enough that Petunia noticed them. Her face lit up, blonde hair catching in the sun's light as she turned from the other young man, who wore an ill-fitting brown suit. He had thinning blond hair and a rather impressive mustache.</p><p>"Hermione!" greeted Petunia, standing and coming forward to hug Hermione tightly, forcing her to drop James' hand. She turned to the black-haired teen next to her and smirked. "James."</p><p>"Petunia," greeted James easily with a grin, rocking back a bit on his heels. "Are you going to ambush me in some type of plan again?"</p><p>"What? Wait, what? What plan? Ambush?" asked Hermione, looking between the two. "Tuney!"</p><p>The man she was talking to coughed into a large hand, looking at Hermione and James curiously and with a bit of a stink eye. Petunia ignored Hermione, turning to the man and said, instead, "Hermione, James, this is Vernon Dursley. He's in my accounting class."</p><p>Hermione froze, eyeing the man again and seeing the man he'd become. <em>Holy crap.</em></p><p>"Vernon, this is my youngest sister, Hermione," Petunia continued, still at Hermione's side. "And…" Petunia trailed off, looking at the two of them with raised eyebrows.</p><p>James however, extended a hand. "James Potter, Hermione's boyfriend."</p><p>Vernon shook it with a few brief, hard pumps and dropped the hand, but there was a look of relief on his face. "Vernon Dursely," he grunted out.</p><p>"Boyfriend, huh?" murmured Hermione into James' ear as she eased past him to shake Vernon's hand, too. James' ear tips turned red.</p><p>Instead of shaking her hand, Vernon tried to be charming and kissed the back of it. Hermione hid a grimace from him but quickly looked at Petunia, who looked like she was hiding a laugh behind her hand.</p><p>"Nice to meet you," said Hermione, rather insincerely.</p><p>Vernon smiled nervously, bringing a pocket-handkerchief out from his suit jacket to mop at his brow. "I was, uh, asking Petunia if she'd like to join me for dinner. If you and your-" he glanced at James, "-your boyfriend haven't eaten yet, you should join us."</p><p>"Oh. Oh," blinked Hermione. "That's very kind of you, but Tuney and I already had plans. James was just bringing me back to meet with her."</p><p>James snorted, covering it quickly into a cough when Vernon glanced at him, a frown pulling at his face and mustache. "Oh. Oh, I see. Well." He turned to Petunia and brightly asked, "Is that so? Maybe another time, then."</p><p>Petunia did not deny their plans, and demurred, "Maybe."</p><p>Vernon made his goodbyes and slowly left the three, pausing every so often to glance back at them, but they remained by the fountain, watching him.</p><p>Eventually, he was far enough away that Hermione turned to Petunia and said, crossly, "That's not Sean, and I'm disappointed in you. He's <em>terrible</em>."</p><p>Petunia rolled her eyes. "He's just a classmate."</p><p>"Who wants <em>more</em>," argued Hermione. "Besides, did you see that mustache? He's barely, what? Twenty-one?" Hermione threw a hand up at the Nelson column as she hotly added, "That's something an admiral from 1812 would have!"</p><p>"I don't know," added James, "I thought it was pretty impressive. And I've seen some strange facial hair."</p><p>"I don't want to know," declared Petunia, shaking her head. "Wizards are weird."</p><p>"They can be," acknowledged James solemnly with a nod. "Anyway," he turned to Hermione, becoming a bit more bashful. "Thank you for today. I'll owl you and we can plan another date?"</p><p>"That would be great," answered Hermione, shyly, and very aware that Petunia was watching them closely.</p><p>James seemed to not care because he reached forward and gave Hermione a very chaste, but firm, kiss on her lips with his arms around her. It turned into a hug, and then he stepped back, but his eyes were fixated on her.</p><p>"I'll owl."</p><p>"So you said," teased Hermione with a grin.</p><p>James' grin was lopsided and adorable. "Yeah, I guess I did."</p><p>"Oh, my God, you two," groaned Petunia, rolling her eyes. "This is sickening. You two are disgustingly cute."</p><p>She reached forward and took Hermione's arm in her hand and began walking her away. "Bye, James!" She called loudly.</p><p>"Bye, Tuney!" the Potter teenager replied cheekily, giving them a jaunty wave as he turned and walked away, melting into the crowd.</p><p>"He's such a rascal," muttered Petunia, but there was approval in her tone.</p><p>"Yeah," agreed Hermione, thinking of the Marauders. "But you know what?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Hermione pushed her shoulder against Petunia's. She had a wide grin on her face. "I think I like that."</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC...</p>

  <strong>August 1977 </strong>
</p><p>Hermione's correspondence with Barty and Regulus - and by extension, Alphard Black - was in direct opposition in written content to the owls she sent and received from James Potter. If she wasn't used to the subterfuge that came with her previous life as Hermione Granger and Dumbledore's Army, then she was sure she would've messed up somewhere along the line with her letters.</p><p>But she was Hermione no-longer-Granger, but Evans, and she didn't make those kinds of mistakes.</p><p>Immediately following her date with James, Hermione returned to Cokeworth. After the events of the cave and their second horcrux, pretending to be visiting Petunia to hide her actions from her parents and Lily, she ended up <em>actually</em> visiting Petunia. The eldest Evans was entering her second year at uni and had decided to move permanently to London for school but would wait until the end of the autumn term.</p><p>With the new bonds between the eldest and youngest sisters, Hermione relished Petunia's more devious streak and ability to keep and hone secrets in ways that Lily - a Gryffindor - would not be able to do. Lily was too emotionally invested, too bold and bright, to seek the darker things involved in hunting horcruxes or engaging with Dark Magic. It was something that Hermione, Harry, and Ron learned during their horcrux hunt - just how difficult it was to hold onto their morals and ethics when burdened with Tom Riddle's soul whispering sweet nothings to them, whispering to the most hidden, most secret desires and wants and hoping to drag them into the light.</p><p>They had been so naive, so close to failure when on their own. Hermione would not see that happen again, this time around.</p><p>Maybe it was providence then, this time around, that her best friends were two teenage boys (<em>but not Harry, not Ron,</em> a part of her cried): one the son of a Dark family, volatile and emotional (although she had yet to see Regulus scrap the bottom of that barrel; it was coming, she knew), and the son of the head Auror, a politician, who had a tenuous grip on reality as it was and loyalty in spades.</p><p>Both were… <em>flexible</em> in ways that Ron never had been - and both were much cooler and savvier in their handling of things than Harry was. Hermione remembered that much. But she couldn't remember Ron's laugh or how Harry's broodiness could cut like diamonds. Those were fading, and in a way, Hermione mourned.</p><p>But then, here she was, at Alphard's Haberdashery, with Barty and Regulus, doing a planning session on how to destroy the horcruxes without tipping their hand to Voldemort or his Death Eaters, and the pain that the loss of Harry and Ron was, lessened.</p><p>It didn't go away and it never would, not completely - but it lessened. There were more important things to focus on.</p><p>"-It really comes down to these two possibilities," sighed Regulus, looking at the collection of parchment the four of them had drawn up over several hours worth of discussion. "Either we destroy them now, or we wait until we're out of Hogwarts."</p><p>"If we destroy them now," began Barty tentatively as he nibbled nervously on a finger sandwich Alphard's house-elf brought them earlier that afternoon, "will he know?"</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "Unsure. I never could figure that out. But I think since each piece of soul is slivered off his original, it becomes separate enough that he can't tell. Especially in inanimate objects."</p><p>Alphard, from where he sat in his wingback chair, turned his mercurial eyes on her and pursed his lips the tiniest bit. "Inanimate? Are you implying that someone could make a horcrux of something animate?"</p><p>Regulus looked sick. "Like - like an animal or something?"</p><p>There was a sour look to Hermione's face, as though she were upset at her slip. But she thought back to Nagini and Harry, and muttered, "Or something alright."</p><p>"Well, let's shelve that then," said Barty instead, plowing through the awkward silence that fell on the group.</p><p>"And stick with objects," added Alphard, stroking his beard. "I believe I have a lead on one."</p><p>Immediately, three heads turned his way and their voices rang over one another:</p><p>"You <em>do</em>?"</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"How did you find <em>that </em>out?"</p><p>Alphard grinned, the expression making him look far younger than he was. "Well, now, that's a story! It was last week, and I was at Lady Selwyn's tea party for Archibald, and it was the loveliest weather, so we were all outside at the pavilion when your cousins appeared. And why wouldn't they? Narcissa and Bellatrix <em>are</em> ladies of influential houses-"</p><p>Hermione snorted.</p><p>"-Of course, Narcissa was wearing the <em>most fetching </em>shade of cornflower blue - it complements her hair, being the only blonde in the family, you see - and her dress was absolutely exquisite! Bellatrix, well, she always prefers black nowadays…"</p><p>Regulus was staring at his uncle in horror while Barty seemed to be hanging on his every word, leaning forward, and watching the older man intently, even as he absently took bites from his finger sandwich.</p><p>"Well! Imagine my surprise to see my nieces, but I went and said hello," continued Alphard, a tiny smile on his lips. "Narcissa was doing well, it seemed, absolutely glowing. Perhaps Cygnus and Druella will have an announcement soon?"</p><p><em>Doubt it,</em> thought Hermione.</p><p>"Bellatrix, on the other hand, was dour as ever, but seemed to enjoy her position and instead of graciously thanking Lady Selwyn for the invite to her crup's party, began ordering the woman about! I say, it was terribly embarrassing."</p><p>Regulus' horror turned to confusion. "Wait, I thought the party was for Archibald."</p><p>"It was," agreed Alphard.</p><p>"But you said the crup…?" he made a face.</p><p>Barty, however, cut his eyes at his friend. "Keep up, Reg, <em>the crup</em> is Archibald." He turned back to Alphard. "Please, sir, what happened next?"</p><p>Regulus sent a glare at Barty while Hermione tried to hide her snickers behind a hand even as Alphard continued his story.</p><p>"Thank you, Crouch." Alphard nodded in Barty's direction and Barty preened, a slight blush to his ear tips. "Before I was interrupted - Bellatrix was talking about how she was given an important piece of history recently, as her dedication to the 'cause.'" He even raised his hands and made air quotes with his fingers. "It turned out she went to Lady Selwyn's tea party as an attempt to recruit."</p><p>"Did she manage?" asked Hermione, curiously.</p><p>"A few seemed interested," agreed Alphard, slowly, "But to be honest, her audience was the wrong sort. Gentle witches? Charity wives? Ladies of leisure? Not exactly the type to proclaim their undying loyalty to a dark lord."</p><p>Barty nodded. "A very good point."</p><p>"Can we get back to this important piece of history?" asked Regulus instead, annoyed. "Did you get anything else from her?"</p><p>"Me?" Alphard blinked in surprise. "Goodness! I didn't speak to Bellatrix! Why in Merlin's name would I have done that?"</p><p>"To… get… information?" asked Regulus between gritted teeth.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "That's like casting a <em>lumos </em>in a dark room, Reg. It would've been too obvious."</p><p>"Indeed," agreed Alphard, a stern look at his nephew. "I did not receive more, as Lady Bishliwick began speaking <em>very loudly</em> about her son's recent accomplishments at the Ministry, so I paid attention to that-"</p><p><em>"WHY?"</em> moaned Regulus.</p><p>"-because one never knows when such information might be important," concluded Alphard with a glare, speaking as though Regulus has not spoken. "And after the party, when I returned, I sent an owl to my brother and cousin."</p><p>Hermione inhaled sharply. "Whatever for?"</p><p>"Well, I figured Cygnus would want to boast - he was always the type - and Orion has Grimmauld Place locked down enough that I need to ask to see the library," replied Alphard matter-of-factly.</p><p>"Is that safe?" Hermione's mouth turned down into a frown. "They won't suspect something?"</p><p>"Father will suspect," muttered Regulus.</p><p>"Your father hasn't been himself these last few months," countered Alphard sharply, "And while he might be <em>the</em> Black, I am also one and can handle myself."</p><p>Regulus crossed his arms and sat back in his chair. "It's not Father I'm worried about."</p><p>Hermione and Barty shared an awkward glance as the two Blacks glowered at each other across the tiny table filled with finger foods and patisseries. Barty reached for a chocolate-dipped biscuit.</p><p>"If this leads us to another horcrux, it's worth it," Hermione finally said quietly, breaking the glare between the two. "Although if Bellatrix has it, it's likely <em>not</em> at the Lestrange house."</p><p>Alphard sighed in agreement. "True, m'dear. There's only one place she would keep it."</p><p>Barty put down the biscuit. "Gringotts."</p><p>"Possibly." Alphard inclined his head. "Which is why I need to speak with Cygnus and Orion. They will confirm it."</p><p>Regulus' pale complexion whitened further. "Be careful, uncle."</p><p>There was a wane smile on Alphard's weathered face when he replied. "I always am, m'boy."</p><hr /><p>He wasn't.</p><p>Alphard Black - officially - died on August 20th, 1977, according to Regulus and the Black family tapestry. Unofficially, Regulus mentioned that his father and uncle found Alphard's body, delivered to the front steps of Grimmauld Place the morning of August 27th, just before dawn.</p><p>While there were no marks on his body, it was clear he was tortured before he died.</p><p>Given the numerous friends and contacts that the man had, his funeral was a large one, hosted by the Black family. Officially by Arcturus and Melania Black at their estate in Suffolk instead of Pollux and Irma Black, Alphard's parents, who were both still alive – but it meant that Arcturus and Melania had to open the estate for the many walks of life who would be honouring Alphard.</p><p>Hermione was directly invited by Regulus as his friend, or so people thought, instead of as an accomplice to Alphard Black. Both were true, ultimately.</p><p>Unfortunately, Hermione was unable to remain at the Black Estate – due to her "unfortunate heritage", or so Regulus mockingly called it in his owl to her – so Barty stepped up with an invite from his parents, and now she was packing for a three-day stay at the Crouch London townhouse. Both Bartemius Crouch and his wife, as well as Barty, were attending and given his father's position as Head Auror, it provided Hermione not just an excuse to attend, but protection, as well.</p><p>Crouch arrived at her parent's home in Cokeworth on a dreary, rainy day, looking exactly like Hermione remembered him from the Quidditch World Cup, in a bespoke, dark suit. He had an umbrella at his side and his bowler hat matched the suit and shoes, and although the grimace on his face could have been mistaken for the situation, Hermione read it in the way he wiped his leather shoes several times once inside the entry hall of the Evans' home.</p><p>"Thank you for the invite, Mr. Crouch," said Hermione, after introducing her parents and Lily to the man; both Leonard and Rose seemed half in awe, and half at ease at the very English gentleman. Rose kept trying to offer Crouch tea, while Leonard was muttering at Hermione to be kind and a perfect houseguest.</p><p>"We'll need to leave shortly," apologized Crouch when he found a natural break in the conversation in the sitting room. "Wizard funerals are long, drawn-out affairs; Alphard Black's will be doubly so."</p><p>Leonard nodded. "Which is why Hermione will be away a few days; we understand."</p><p>"I will be sure to return her safely by Sunday," the Ministry employee promised. "Despite the circumstances, I have wanted to meet my son's friend, and my wife is eager to have a witch visit."</p><p>At Rose's confused look, Crouch elaborated, "We have only our son."</p><p>Some of Rose's confusion eased, and Hermione made a note to speak to her mother. Instead, Rose and Leonard stood with Crouch, and Lily a half-second behind Hermione, sneaking glances at her younger sister.</p><p>"Do you have your effects?" asked Crouch at Hermione.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>"Then say your goodbyes and we shall Apparate directly to the house," the man instructed, stepping back into the entry hall to give Hermione privacy as she turned to her parents in the living room.</p><p>Leonard hugged her and kissed the top of her head, passing her to her mother. They hugged and whispered their goodbyes, and then Hermione paused in front of Lily. The tension was obvious to everyone in the room, even if her parents didn't know why.</p><p>Lily's arms were tightly wrapped around her chest. "Take care."</p><p>"Thanks." Hermione pursed her lips, nodded, and then strode to the entry where Crouch was looking at a pocket watch. He snapped the cover closed when he noticed her, tucking the gold piece away in his waist coast.</p><p>He held out his elbow and Hermione curled her hand around the offered gesture, and with a step, they turned and reappeared hundreds of miles away, in the receiving room of the Crouch London townhouse.</p><p>Hermione's first impression was that the townhome <em>absolutely</em> reflected Bartemius Crouch and the fact that he was competent Ministry employee, because not only did the home reek of money, it was nowhere near the dark, Victorian tones of what Grimmauld Place had been, but decorated in a tasteful, classy but very 1970s manner.</p><p>The receiving room – or entrance, really – was a large white marble tile flooring, edged in black with gold gilded furniture: a console table, a large mirror, a chaise lounger, and two matching armchairs in deep royal blue. A chandelier hung above, directly central to the room, tossing glittering reflections of light beams around the shiny room.</p><p>Double-doors in near-black wood were then thrown open, Barty sliding and skidding into the receiving room, flailing his arms as his shoes made a very loud noise against the marble flooring.</p><p>His father shot him a glare and Barty cringed. "Sorry Father, I was excited to see—"</p><p>But the elder Crouch scowled and dipped his head once, at Hermione. "My son will show you to your room while you stay with us, Miss Evans. We will leave for the funeral tomorrow morning at first light. Please be prepared then."</p><p>"Thank you again, Mr. Crouch," Hermione had time to say before the man swept from the room through the same doors Barty appeared from, although he took much of the dourness that had seeped into her and the room as he did so.</p><p>"So. That was my father," said Barty, rolling his eyes. He reached for Hermione's hand and tugged at her. "C'mon, I'll show you to your room and then Mother wants to meet you."</p><p>The room Barty showed her to was near his, at the top of the townhouse. The room was light and airy, slightly feminine with its lace curtains and soft fabrics on the bed, and there was a house-elf putting her things away in a drawer.</p><p>"Hermione, this is Winky," introduced Barty, gesturing at the elf, who squeaked and turned when they entered. "She's our house elf. You just need to call her name and she'll attend you if you have any need."</p><p>Inwardly, Hermione Granger's annoyance of bonded house-elves rose. Rationally, Hermione knew about house-elves bonds from her previous life, but there was a part of her that still bristled at their treatment and how poorly wizards and witches treated them – regardless of what the house-elves themselves needed or thought.</p><p>"Hi Winky," she said instead, mustering up a bit of a weak smile. "Thank you for your help."</p><p>Winky's bulbous eyes popped open, rounder and wider at the kindness.</p><p>"Miss." She curtseyed and then glanced at Barty. "Young master Barty."</p><p>She then popped away.</p><p>Hermione glanced at Barty, who shrugged. "House-elves don't see much kindness." He then grinned. "I guess you're just different and special that way."</p><p>"Uh-huh."</p><p>The two stared at each other for a moment longer, and then Hermione launched herself at him, her fingers finding his side as they wriggled back and forth. Barty shrieked, skipping backward from her, using his arms to ward her off.</p><p>He twisted out of her way, slipping behind her and catching her around the middle, using his height to his advantage as he locked her in place and kept her arms at her side. "Yield!"</p><p>Hermione stomped on his instep, and Barty muttered an oath under his breath but didn't let go. She then went entirely limp, and he suddenly had her whole weight in his arms and in surprise, let go.</p><p>She landed in a crouch on the floor and then sprung up, her own arms outstretched and ready to tickle her friend some more.</p><p>The two were eyeing each other from across the room when a feminine presence appeared in the door, bringing in the soft smell of gardenias. As one, the two Ravenclaws turned to look at the door.</p><p>Barty immediately dropped his arms and stood straight, smoothing his hair down. "Mother!"</p><p>Iris Crouch was tall, willowy, with thin collarbones and pale blonde hair, as well as tired blue eyes and lines around her mouth. But she looked <em>soft</em> – that was the first word Hermione could think of that described the woman. She smiled <em>softly</em>, and when she opened her mouth to speak, it was softly, as well.</p><p>"Hello, Barty," she murmured, her eyes crinkling at the side when she smiled at her son. Those kind eyes were turned to Hermione next, and she stepped into the room – quietly, softly – with her hands extended in greeting. "And you must be Miss Evans – it's so nice to finally meet you, my dear."</p><p>"Mrs. Crouch," began Hermione, stepping away from her friend and smiling back. "Thank you for inviting me into your home."</p><p>"Anything for Barty's friend," the woman turned her eyes back on her son. "Would you two care to join me in the parlour for tea?"</p><p>"Of course," agreed Hermione for them both.</p><p>Mrs. Crouch's smiled turned into a beam, lighting up her entire face. "Lovely." She turned back to her son and sighed, "Oh, Barty-bear, your hair is such a mess—"</p><p>Hermione did her best not to snicker when his mother reached up and patted down at his fluffy, floppy hair. Barty squirmed from her, whining, "<em>Mother!</em>"</p><p>She sighed, retracting her hand. "I'll see you two shortly, then."</p><p>Barty's face was bright red after she left the room, and Hermione couldn't hold in her grin. "C'mon, <em>Barty-bear</em>. Let's go have tea with your mum."</p><p>He groaned. "Don't call me that!" Then he paused, and whipped his head around to plead, "<em>Don't</em> tell Reg about my Moher's nickname for me!"</p><p>"Aww, why not? I think it's cute." Hermione grinned at him as Barty led her out of her room and back down the winding, ornate staircase in the middle of the townhouse.</p><p>Scowling, Barty muttered, "Only Mother can call me that."</p><p>Softening to her friend, Hermione reached forward and clasped his hand. "It's cute. And it's clear she loves you very much."</p><p><em>So much so,</em> thought Hermione, with a tinge of sadness, <em>that she would give her life for yours in a heartbeat, no matter what you do.</em></p><p>Chuffed, Barty ducked his head and grinned. "Yeah, well, I love her, too."</p><p>"I'm guessing she did the raising when your dad was at work," began Hermione hesitantly.</p><p>Barty's grin turned into a scowl. "Father… he was always busy. Is still busy with the Ministry." His voice went a bit distant. "I don't really have that many memories of him as a child, and by the time I went to Hogwarts, he had… these expectations for me, I guess."</p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes.</p><p>Sighing, Barty finished, "At least I ended up in Ravenclaw. He can get away with saying I'm studious. I'm not sure what he'd try to tell his Ministry friends if I were in Hufflepuff or Gryffindor. Slytherin would've been preferable, too, I suppose – then I'd be ambitious, and he might have been prouder."</p><p>"Was your dad in Slytherin, then?" asked Hermione, trying to cast her mind back – and forward – in time, if anyone had ever mentioned what house Bartemius Crouch, senior, had attended.</p><p>"Ravenclaw," answered Barty as they entered the parlour, where Mrs. Crouch already had high tea set up for them with Winky's help.</p><p>"Speaking about Hogwarts, dears?" the Crouch matron asked, looking up from the teapot as she began to pour into delicate china teacups with fancy, floral patterns.</p><p>"Just about Houses and where Father went, Mother," answered Barty, promptly collapsing into a couch.</p><p>His mother sent him a look and he hastily sat upright, and Hermione bit back a smile as she carefully sat, primly tucking her knees together and kicking her heels back and under the seat. Mrs. Crouch smiled at her approvingly.</p><p>"What house were you in, Mrs. Crouch?" asked Hermione, as she took an offered plate and began a careful survey of the finger sandwiches and treats.</p><p>"Hufflepuff," the woman sighed. "But don't think that we aren't stubborn! Loyal, hardworking. It's a good house for a Farley, and my parents never complained."</p><p>Hermione could see the woman as a Hufflepuff – the woman who sacrificed herself, even in frail health, for Barty to live, and she wondered how the old Mrs. Crouch from her time would've reacted, knowing that her husband put her son under the <em>imperius</em> curse and left him alone, a prisoner in their townhouse basement for over a decade.</p><p>Something melancholy must have passed over her face because Mrs. Crouch immediately launched into a soft-spoken, but animated, story about a young Barty exploring their yard and falling into the koi pond.</p><p>Barty hammed it up, animated as his mother told stories of his youth. Pride was so very clear in her face and voice as she spoke, and Hermione cast aside the memories of a future that would never be, enjoying the sun-dappled parlour as she learned more about her best friend. There would be enough time – tomorrow at the funeral, and in the future – for somber reflections.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>September 1977</strong>
</p><p>The Hogwarts Express was a bit awkward. Hermione traditionally sat with Regulus and Barty for the ride to school (and every other ride that they took, whether that was for Yule or the end of the school year) but this was the first time she – or Barty, or Regulus – had a significant other to consider.</p><p>Which led to the large group of Gryffindors, two Ravenclaws, and a Slytherin, clogging up the train corridor somewhere near the back of the Express, causing a large number of grumbles from other students trying to find somewhere to sit.</p><p>And at the center of it all, were James and Hermione.</p><p>Who were swivelling their heads back and forth between their two friend groups; James' hands twitching nervously at his side as he struggled to keep them down instead of running through his hair, and Hermione with her hand rubbing against her collarbone, feeling a familiar, phantom ache.</p><p>Barty and Sirius were glaring at one another; Remus looked rather stricken, trying to slink back and hide behind Peter Pettigrew, despite his height was comically similar to Barty's own gangly form, and Regulus kept his mercurial eyes fixated on his brother, betraying not a single emotion.</p><p>"This is going to end in bloodshed," muttered James, glancing between the two groups.</p><p>Hermione privately agreed, eyes stuck on Barty. His face was flushed in anger, and she was sure he was about ten seconds away from drawing his wand on Sirius.</p><p>"At least being with you isn't dull," huffed Hermione.</p><p>James sent her an affronted look. Then, he sighed. "I just wanted to sit with you on a train before I had to do patrols…"</p><p>"Let me calm down Barty. Then I'll join you."</p><p>Hermione sidestepped James and planted herself in front of Barty. Had James not already seen the two of them before, in the Room of Requirements – and if <em>that</em> wasn't something he'd have to mention at some point – he would have burned with jealousy when Hermione bodily pushed up against Barty, her chest somewhere level with his stomach.</p><p>She muttered something lowly, something so low only Barty, and Remus if his twitch was any indication, heard. But it was enough that Barty's glare turned into a scowl, and his brown eyes slid off Sirius and toward his friend.</p><p>His hand, the one clenching his wand, slowly eased from a white-knuckle grip as he placed it back in his holster.</p><p>"One day," began Barty slowly, "One day – you and me – we're going to have a – <em>discussion</em>."</p><p>Grimly, Sirius flattened his mouth in a line but nodded. His friends had forgiven him for that night after their OWLs, but with James and Hermione dating, Sirius knew he owed something to her friends as well. He had previously gotten away with saying nothing, but that was a coward's way out, and that shamed him.</p><p>"Later," murmured Regulus, steering Barty away, and then down the corridor to their usual compartment.</p><p>Hermione sighed and entered the nearest one, practically falling into the seat while James followed her in; Sirius trailed after him, with Remus and Peter bringing up the rear. The group was rather solemn after the interaction, which wasn't how James wanted to start off Hermione's official introduction to the group.</p><p>"So…" the silence stretched between the five in the carriage, even as Sirius did his best to dispel it. "How was your summer, aside from Uncle's funeral, Princess?"</p><p>Hermione made a face. "I really wish you'd stop calling me that."</p><p>"I will once it stops bothering you because right now it's really fun," retorted Sirius quickly, flashing her a grin from the opposite seat.</p><p><em>Still better than 'kitten,'</em> she thought. She sighed. "It was fine. I kept busy."</p><p>"Doing what?" asked Peter, inquisitively. He even leaned forward when he asked.</p><p>Hermione glanced over, mouth pulling at the corners the tiniest bit as distaste grew. Was there a polite way to say, 'none of your business?' to the Gryffindor without insulting James' taste in friends?</p><p>Remus must have sensed something, because he instead asked, "Are you planning on taking any N.E.W.T.s this year, Hermione?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "No – two during O.W.L.s was enough. Everything else is scheduled for my seventh year."</p><p>Bored with the conversation, Sirius, who was slouched in his seat, loudly spoke up. "Blah, blah, blah. We're not even at Hogwarts yet, and you two are already talking school!" He groaned. "This is what happens when you put two bookworms in the same space."</p><p>With experienced patience, James asked, "Well, what do <em>you</em> want to talk about then?"</p><p>Sirius sat up, a gleam in his eyes. "With the money Uncle Alphard left me, I have enough for a motorcycle. I've been dreaming of one for <em>ages</em>. It'll be a chick magnet."</p><p>"Do you know which you want?" asked Hermione curiously. She knew he had a Triumph Bonneville, which Harry had taken to driving obnoxiously whenever he visited Dudley in her other life.</p><p>Sirius shrugged. "As long as it's loud, it'll annoy old Wally, and that's all I care about."</p><p><em>Well, that was the same,</em> thought Hermione. "My uncle has a motorcycle. If you want, I can send a letter home and have my parents ask him about his, to give you a starting point."</p><p>Sirius turned his grey eyes to Hermione, surprised. "Really, Princess?"</p><p>"Would you stop calling me that, if I did?" she asked.</p><p>He grinned. "Depends on what information your uncle provides."</p><p>From there, the conversation turned to additions for a motorbike, with Peter suggesting the sidecar, and Remus focusing on its safety features. James and Sirius hammed up the bike itself, suggesting wilder and wilder options, including its future flight feature.</p><p>Hermione kept quiet, unless someone asked her about Muggle laws, to which she knew little about, but as time went on and the conversation grew from there, she found herself relaxing.</p><p>Yes, Sirius was still loud, with his barking laugh and brash personality – but this Sirius was also so stupidly immature that he was nowhere near the pale shadow of his future self.</p><p>Even Remus, her favourite professor, was far more outgoing with his animated conversation about cushioning charms, anti-crash jinxes, and rain-repelling charm for the future motorcycle that Hermione had trouble connecting him to the pale-faced, lonely (and sometimes, cowardly) man that taught her.</p><p>Peter, Hermione was surprised to find, was nowhere near as sycophant as she originally thought. He still hung off of James and Sirius's every word, but he also offered his own suggestions and wasn't afraid to talk smack back when Sirius dismissed his sidecar idea originally, even if his response to why a sidecar was needed was more R-rated than Hermione would've thought. It did win over Sirius, though.</p><p>James was already so far from Harry in her mind that the two weren't even in the same sphere to her – despite their spitting image looks.</p><p><em>Why did you spend so long hiding from these people?</em> She wondered to herself, relaxing back in the plush red velvet of the carriage seat, James' arm around her shoulders. <em>You never gave them a chance.</em></p><p>Perhaps Room-Harry was smarter than she initially thought – or, rather, her subconscious took the easiest and more acceptable route to get her to socialize more with her peers in this reality. She wasn't an interloper, an outsider who appeared and meddled. Hermione was <em>part</em> oft this world, built in and existing to the point that she touched people and influenced them regardless if she separated herself from the Marauders – or, Lily, or Snape, or anyone else. Things in the future still might happen the way she knew, independent of her, but she had to stop comparing the past that she knew – her past – to what she was experiencing now. It was no way to live, in the past, constantly under the shadow of people's future actions and expectations.</p><p>Something heavy felt like it lifted off her shoulders with the realization, despite James' comforting weight. It was like the last of her reservations were finally gone, and with that, she snuggled a bit more into James' side.</p><p>He glanced down at her, that silly, lovely lopsided grin of his, and pressed a kiss to her temple. It left her warm and comforted, and she smiled into his shoulder.</p><hr /><p>Scheduling time to spend with her boyfriend - <em>God, that's weird to think,</em> thought Hermione with a tiny face - was difficult.</p><p>Hermione did not want to give up her Saturdays spent in her research classroom with Regulus and Barty, especially as their work into Voldemort's horcruxes was necessary to end the war. She also had several side projects, and needed time to visit the Room of Requirement to practice her transmutations, preferably with Regulus and Barty so that they could improve their spellcasting in addition to her own homework (easily completed). She was also vaguely social, between Barty and Regulus, Regulus' Quidditch matches, and Dirk, in addition to James and the Marauders now.</p><p>James, being a seventh year, had N.E.W.T.s to study for (including a surprising N.E.W.T. to take in Arithmancy, so their Fridays would continue with tutoring in the library, in "their" corner). He was also the Gryffindor Quidditch captain, after four years on the team as chaser, and now Head Boy. While the latter was a surprise, it did mean that he had patrols, responsibilities in scheduling the prefects, setting prefect meetings, and distributing and managing issues that prefects and students brought to him. Between his patrols, meetings, study sessions, homework, and Quidditch, there wasn't much time for Hermione.</p><p>"This would be so much easier if you were a prefect," whined James during one of their Friday tutoring sessions.</p><p>It was a guise of a tutoring session, although mostly for Hermione's sake. They did arithmancy and James spent the majority of the time studying while simultaneously finding ways to distract Hermione by playing with her hair and brushing up against her side, as he had moved his chair to next to her instead of across.</p><p>"Me being a prefect wasn't on anyone's notice," replied Hermione wryly, "despite my stellar grades in a few classes."</p><p>James looked at her curiously. "What about Crouch?"</p><p>Hermione grinned. "He said no. Wasn't interested."</p><p>"Sounds right," snorted James. "And Regulus is a prefect, isn't he? I think Sirius mentioned something about that last year…"</p><p>Hermione hummed her agreement. She then tapped the parchment in front of her with her quill. "Now, explain to me again Al-Khalil's probability theory."</p><p>James groaned, but grinned that lopsided grin of this, and began.</p><p>Forty minutes later, their tutoring session eased into general conversation and comfortable silence. James had an arm around the back of Hermione's chair, his hand brushing against her shoulder and arm every so often while his other played with her fingers, plucking at a few or running his forefinger down the groves and lines of her palm.</p><p>"I hope you're not going to try to read my hand," she said at one point, derision in her voice. "Palmistry is hardly a reliable form of reading the future <em>if</em> someone even thought divination was accurate at all!"</p><p>A wicked glint appeared in James' hazel eyes.</p><p>"Oh, no…"</p><p>The Gryffindor sniffed, affected a strange tilt to his head, and began, in a highly affected voice, "Ah, my dear, look at this hand! Did you know you have an air hand?"</p><p>"Excuse me?" Hermione's tone was dry as she glared, trying to tug her hand away but James' hand tightened around it. She was having Hermione Granger flashbacks to throwing her hand in the air to answer questions.</p><p>"Air hands are those with square palms and long fingers," explained James, tracing the inner side of the fingers and making Hermione squirm when it tickled. "Air hands are intellectual individuals, who are curious and have innate analytical abilities and communication skills." He looked up. "Or, so Madame Mimi says."</p><p>"Madame Mimi, huh?" Hermione rolled her eyes. So <em>that </em>was the name of Trelawney's predecessor. Hermione still didn't hold much stock in the field of study, especially in comparison to something more logic-based to divine probability and outcomes.</p><p>"Uh-huh," grinned James, giving Hermione a knowing look, "And air hands are easily distracted and, if not stimulated, can become anxious or edgy."</p><p>Hermione was <em>not</em> impressed. "Don't even think of reading the lines, James."</p><p>Deftly twisting his wrist to look at his wristwatch, James went, "oh, look at the time," only to take a double look and actually yelp, "Merlin - <em>look at the time</em>! I have patrol in fifteen minutes."</p><p>Eyes wide, he caught Hermione's gaze. "I'm so sorry, I need to go-"</p><p>He began to gather up their study notes and spare parchment, Hermione leaning over the table to help him until everything was in a neat pile for him to shove into his satchel. James was muttering to himself, out loud about his potential patrol route, and completely distracted. He even ran his hands through his hair a few times, messing up the thick black hair so that there were several cowlicks and curls sticking out straight, especially at the back.</p><p><em>It was a bit cute</em>, Hermione thought, but anything else froze when James leaned over, pecked her lightly on the mouth, and muttered, "See you later," only to sprint out of the library looking a bit like a madman, with his hair and wide eyes.</p><p>Hermione brought a shaking hand to her mouth and lightly touched her fingertips to her tingling lips. "See you later," she murmured after him in the silence of the arithmancy section of the library.</p><p>Since when had they upgraded to kisses goodbye? They had only officially been together since midsummer, and even then, they had only seen each other a handful of times before meeting up on the Hogwarts Express. And it was only the third week of school!</p><p>With a sigh, Hermione began to clean up her arithmancy books, stacking them neatly with the intent to return them to their shelves. With an absent wave of her hand, the books floated up and off the table, bobbing gently behind her as she made her way down the stacks in a circular fashion so that she would return to her table and bag after finishing the last text.</p><p>But something caught her attention as she was shelving the second to last book: a rather familiar voice from the stack over.</p><p>"-wanted to apologize, but you just… ignored me," the male said, voice soft if not terse and frustrated in a low baritone.</p><p>"Well, what did you expect?" Lily's voice replied, just as terse and thick with her accent. "It had been a busy year for you: Macnair and Avery used that Dark curse on Mary and got away with it; you defended them, and then you - you used <em>that</em> word!"</p><p>"I didn't say it to <em>you</em>!" the male retorted - and Hermione knew it was Lily and Snape, in heated whispers, having their first conversation in nearly two years. She felt vaguely dirty at eavesdropping, but then mentally shrugged and pressed a bit closer to the books on her side of the stack.</p><p>Lily scoffed. "No, you said it to my sister."</p><p>"She didn't seem to care," mumbled Snape, mulishly.</p><p>"<em>I</em> care," stressed Lily. There was silence, and then she sighed, long and low. "What did you think was going to happen, Sev? When you said that word? After everything you were getting up to with - those - those-"</p><p>"You mean <em>my friends</em>?" Snape's response was icy. "You weren't my only friend, Lily. I was in Slytherin; did you think I would just be social for you?"</p><p>"I - No -" but the hesitance in her voice made it clear to Hermione that that was what she honestly thought. Eventually, Lily said, quietly, "I don't like seeing you with them."</p><p>"And I didn't like seeing you around Lupin and Potter, but well, we can't get what we want, can we?"</p><p>"I'm not-!" Lily let out a long, hissed breath. "They're my housemates."</p><p>"And Macnair and Avery are mine," replied Snape just as quietly. He paused, and then added in a bit of a lighter voice, "At least Potter isn't sniffing around you anymore."</p><p>Lily let out a choked huff of laughter. "Yeah, there is that."</p><p>Tentatively, Snape continued, "I, uh. I heard that Potter and Hermione are… they're together?"</p><p>"Yeah, they are."</p><p>"And, um. Um, you're okay… with that?"</p><p>"Why wouldn't I be?" asked Lily, bewildered.</p><p>Snape cleared his throat. "Well, there was a time…"</p><p>She groaned. "Oh, not you too! Why does everything think I fancied Potter? I mean… yeah, I guess… I liked the attention. I liked being singled out - but I have with our professors, too, when I do a spell right in class. And it's… weird… not having his attention on me anymore. But it wasn't because I fancied him, Sev!"</p><p>"Well, that's good to know."</p><p><em>Ah yes,</em> thought Hermione with a grin, <em>there's that awkward boy I grew up with. I can picture him standing stiffly and looking around anywhere but Lily with the way this conversation is going.</em></p><p>"To be honest, if I knew that all I needed to do to get Potter off my back was introduce him to Hermione, I would've done it ages ago," said Lily quietly, and Hermione's grin dropped off her face, turning into a frown.</p><p>"She hates attention," chuckled Snape, "And she would've <em>hated</em> Potter from the start."</p><p>"That might be an Evans thing," laughed Lily, "Disliking Potter. But, well…" she trailed off. "He's been good for her? Since she started tutoring him, did you notice?"</p><p>"I don't pay much attention to her, Lil," sighed Snape.</p><p><em>And we all know why</em>, thought Hermione, pressing on her toes to look over the edge of the books on the shelf and to peer across the stack into the aisle on the other side. Snape was pinching his nose, eyes closed as if pained, while she could only see the back of Lily's shiny red hair.</p><p>"Oh," said her sister. "Well, she's just - much more outgoing at home now! Participating in family meals and hanging out in the evenings instead of retreating to her room. And," now her voice turned sad, "she's spending a lot of time with Tuney-"</p><p>"She's a Muggle, who cares?" muttered Snape.</p><p>"Sev!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I just miss how it was before Hogwarts, the three of us together," said Lily quietly, reaching up and playing with a strand of silky hair. Her voice was despondent. "I hoped we'd have that here at Hogwarts, but she seems to spend more time with Tuney than me, and I…"</p><p>"Lily?" Snape's eyes were wide and slightly panicked.</p><p>"I miss her," choked out Lily, her voice thick with tears. "I miss Hermione. I haven't spoken to her since… since <em>that</em> night, and then she was hurt, and we're not talking, and-"</p><p>Snape hesitantly reached out and patted Lily on the shoulder. "Um, it's okay, um-"</p><p>Lily sniffled and wiped away tears with her hands. "You're still terrible at this."</p><p>"I know. I'm sorry." He looked awkwardly around and Hermione quickly fell to the flat of her feet to avoid being seen when his dark eyes swept the stack. "Do you, um, want me to stay…?"</p><p>"No, it's okay," came Lily's quiet reply. "I think it's best that I clean myself up."</p><p>"Okay." Snape paused. "Lily? It was… it was good to speak to you again. I missed you."</p><p>"I missed you too, Sev," Lily replied, happiness leaking into her voice.</p><p>There was a shuffling noise, and then Snape departed, leaving Lily huffing and trying to control her emotions.</p><p>Hermione stalled for a moment, glancing at the two remaining books that were bobbing patiently at her side and then soundlessly sighed. She shelved one in its proper place and then walked down the stack, hoping her acting skills had improved. She rounded the corner, and, upon seeing her elder sister leaning against the stack, arms held tight to her chest, Hermione stopped in surprise and went, "Oh."</p><p>At the noise, Lily's head shot up, along with her wand. She then let it drop. "Hermione!"</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat awkwardly. "Lily."</p><p>She glanced around, hoping it looked like she was uncomfortable. In a way, she <em>was</em>, after hearing all that, but she also missed her sister. She peered at Lily, lingering on the puffiness and red tinge around her eyes. "Are you okay?"</p><p>Lily sniffed, tilting his chin up. "Yes, fine."</p><p>"Fine," echoed Hermione dubiously with a frown.</p><p>With a scowl, Lily stressed, "<em>Fine</em>."</p><p><em>This is going so well</em>, thought Hermione as the two sisters eyed each other warily. Finally, Hermione sighed, thinking, <em>this was a mistake</em>.</p><p>"Well. See you around," she said lamely, giving a small wave and turning on her heel to leave the aisle.</p><p>She made it two steps before Lily called out, "Hermione, wait!"</p><p>Hermione stopped, glancing over her shoulder at her sister but otherwise not facing her or leaving. She was tired, so tired of this song and dance. "What, Lily?"</p><p>"I-" Lily choked off and Hermione turned to look at her. The Gryffindor had stopped several feet away, near the middle of the aisle, and was blinking rapidly at Hermione. When she noticed her looking, Lily's green eyes darted away. "How have you been?"</p><p>Hermione's eyebrows jerked up. "What's next, are you going to ask me about the weather?"</p><p>Lily huffed, crossing her arms.</p><p>Sighing, Hermione answered her. "I'm good, Lily. Just as fine as I was at home this summer."</p><p>"You were barely home," muttered the redhead, slowly sinking down until she was sitting on the hardwood flooring of the library with her knees up, pressed against her chest with her arms looped around them.</p><p>Hermione took a few steps forward. "What are you talking about? I only went to Tuney's for about a week in July, and then I was with Barty at the Crouch's for a few days for Alphard Black's funeral. James and I saw each other maybe, I dunno, four times all summer?"</p><p>"Maybe you were <em>physically</em> present, Hermione," began Lily, a bit cattish, "But you weren't there mentally. You were always off in your own world."</p><p>"I've got a lot on my mind," replied Hermione dryly, mimicking Lily's earlier pose and crossing her arms.</p><p>"Well, I wouldn't know that, would I?" retorted Lily hotly, and then she flushed, the blush of her cheeks clashing terribly with her hair. "I'm - I'm sorry, that was cruel of me-"</p><p>Hermione sighed and walked over until she was next to Lily, and then she sank to the floor herself, crossing her legs and fixing her skirt so it covered the important bits. "No, you're not. You're pissed with me."</p><p>Lily's nose wrinkled. "Pissed with you? Are you drunk now?"</p><p>Mentally, Hermione went over the sentence again and nearly groaned. "Pissed <em>off</em> with me," she corrected, annoyed that a future slang word crept into her vocabulary despite her having never used one before; idioms and allusions, yes, but full slang? Her cheeks heated.</p><p>Lily was silent for a moment or two before quietly admitting, "Yes. I'm upset with you. I have been for a while, I think."</p><p>"So, it's not about Snape, is it?" asked Hermione. "It was me. You were angry at me and used that afternoon after your O.W.L.s to take it out on me."</p><p>"Got a bit of a bob on yourself, have you?" scoffed Lily, glaring at Hermione. "It's not all about you, you know."</p><p>Hermione stared at Lily.</p><p>The other girl resisted a few minutes before sighing, loudly, and saying, "Alright, it <em>was</em> about you. I just… I had these - <em>plans</em> - and you…"</p><p>"Mucked them all up?"</p><p>"Well…"</p><p>"Sorry I disappointed you," murmured Hermione, looking down and picking at a bit of thread on her jumper. "I think I disappointed a lot of people."</p><p>"I shouldn't have put those pressures on you." Lily shook her head. "I had this - grand plan - about what our life at Hogwarts would be, both of us in Gryffindor, and I never… I never <em>asked</em> if it was something you wanted. I just took it for granted." Her voice dropped lower. "I think I took you for granted for a long time."</p><p>Hermione glanced at her in shock.</p><p>"Oh, don't look at me like that," the older girl sighed. "I think you know it, too. Tunney was… she's the big sister. She looked out for us. I was the precocious middle child, able to be perfect and get away with everything and the first witch in the family. But you… no one quite knew what to do with you."</p><p>"Wow. Thanks, Lily." Hermione stretched her legs out and rocked them back and forth a bit. She knew she had never meant to be born, anyway, despite what the room said, but now that she was part of this world, it hurt to think that her strange, melancholy behaviour as a toddler once she realized where and who she was, had established the relationships that lingered between her, her parents, and Lily.</p><p>"No! No! I didn't mean-" Lily exhaled loudly and squeezed her eyes shut. "You were just so different from Tuney and I. I don't think any of us knew what to do."</p><p>Hermione kept silent.</p><p>"I think… you just <em>saw </em>things differently to how I did," continued Lily quietly. "And I don't think I liked that very much."</p><p>The two sisters sat side-by-side, silent in their thoughts.</p><p>Finally, Lily asked, very, very quietly, "Why didn't it bother you?"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Being… being called <em>that</em>."</p><p>Hermione frowned and smoothed her uniform skirt to bide her time as she collected her thoughts. She knew what Lily was referring to; it seemed she was destined to have this conversation twice in less than four months, both with Gryffindors.</p><p>"It's… it's just a word," Hermione tried to explain. "Like… we spent eleven years of our lives not knowing what 'mudblood' means, and then suddenly we enter the magical world and Purebloods throw it around with an insulting tone and we're supposed to instinctively just <em>get it</em>?" She shook her head. "The word only holds power over us if we let it."</p><p>"They'll still think we're… less than," Lily hesitantly put out, glancing at her younger sister. <em>How was it that there were times when </em>Hermione <em>seemed to be the elder?</em> she wondered. "I… try <em>so hard</em> in class, to make sure I get every answer right and to be first to complete a spell, and it's never enough."</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips, thinking back to how she was when she was a Granger. "They don't care if you're Morgana reincarnated; it just won't ever be enough for their tiny, inbred brains."</p><p>"But it means we don't belong," whispered Lily, her face stricken. "That we're never going to be good enough for this world."</p><p>Hermione scoffed, tossing her curly hair a bit as she did so. "Not good enough? Are you listening to yourself? <em>We're magical</em>. We have magic in our blood. While <em>they </em>might consider my blood to be mud, it's fucking magical, and they can't change that."</p><p>"You're so sure of yourself," whispered Lily, eyes downcast. "You sound more like a Gryffindor than I do right now."</p><p>"Maybe I just don't care," retorted Hermione, just as quietly. And, in her previous life, she grew not to care about the word, wearing her scar like a badge of honour. "I'm here for me, Lily. I'm studying magic because <em>I</em> want to; because <em>I</em> have goals and dreams."</p><p>Lily finally looked at her, a curious gleam in those familiar, emerald eyes. "Which are?"</p><p>But Hermione shook her head, continuing to speak in a low voice. "My goals won't matter at the end of the day to those wizards and witches out there who believe in the Sacred Twenty-Eight, or Voldemort, or whatever convoluted, backward ideologies they hold. I can't change their minds, and I don't want to take on that responsibility! Either they'll realize that muggleborns are an essential part of magical society, that we don't <em>steal</em> magic, and we're just as goddamn good - or better - at what they do, or they won't."</p><p>"Do Crouch and Black see it that way?" asked Lily, something settling in her.</p><p>Hermione gave a tiny laugh. "Barty doesn't give a shit about anything or anyone."</p><p>"He cares about you," protested Lily, nudging Hermione's shoulder. When Hermione caught her eye, she wiggled her thin eyebrows. "Huh? Huh?"</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "Don't you start, too." She sighed. "Barty and Reg are… they're like… like my <em>limbs</em>."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Lily's flat, accent-thick tone complimented her equally flat stare, enough so that Hermione chuckled at the look.</p><p>"Barty and Regulus are parts of me," she tried explaining. "Like, extensions of myself. I couldn't function properly without them. They're as much a part of me, as I am to them. I'd survive if they left me, or we grew apart, but I'd be… changed."</p><p>There was something heartbreaking on Lily's face, enough that Hermione replied with her own, "what?"</p><p>"I always thought that me and Tuney were like that for you," she mumbled through trembling lips. "That we're part of you."</p><p>"And you <em>are</em>!" Hermione turned on the floor so that she was facing Lily, an earnest look on her as she implored her sister to hear her. "You and Petunia are simply different parts of me, part of my soul. You're family, my blood."</p><p>"But they own a part of you," complained Lily bitterly.</p><p>Hermione sighed. "They don't <em>own</em> me, Lils." At the childhood nickname, Lily's head snapped up. "You and me and Petunia are Evans'. We share blood. Barty and Regulus and I share the same brain, the body."</p><p>Hermione bit her lip, and slowly, she reached out and took Lily's hand in hers. Lily twined her fingers with her younger sister and squeezed.</p><p>"I'm sorry I was so terrible to you," the redhead whispered, bowing her head toward Hermione.</p><p>"I'm sorry I didn't help you understand me more," replied Hermione, equally quiet and bowing her head to her until their foreheads met and their hair - curly auburn and straight red - mixed.</p><p>"I'm sorry I didn't make more of an effort here or at home," continued Lily.</p><p>"I'm sorry I was so stubborn and angry about things after your OWLs. We should've talked things out."</p><p>Lily shook her head, a tiny snort escaping her. "I wouldn't've listened."</p><p>"I should've tried-"</p><p>"Don't be barmy," chided Lily. "'Sides, what is this? An apology competition? We've both said sorry, now let's move on."</p><p>"Okay." Hermione felt her lips twitch into a tiny smile, and her eyes closed in contentment.</p><p>The two fell silent, and after a few minutes, Lily sighed. "D'you think we'll get as close as we should've been?"</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Lily paused, then breathed, "I want to be that close."</p><p>Hermione equally paused, and replied quietly, "Maybe one day."</p><p>"But not today?"</p><p>Thinking back on the hurt, the words Lily spewed at her, and the distance that had grown between them since her second year - now, four years ago - Hermione knew the hurt was still raw and bleeding. "No, not today."</p><p>Lily's sigh was bitter, defeated, but she understood, and it was conveyed when she said, "Okay," and that was all that the two needed.</p><hr /><p>Following her talk with Lily, Hermione felt that things were improved but not enough to be fully social with her older sister. Lily stopped to say hello during meals, and whenever they saw each other in the halls between classes. It was enough that her friends – Marlene, Mary – would also nod or say a hello, even though Hermione was aware that Marlene was still sour toward her (although she had no idea why).</p><p>Lily speaking to Hermione also had another side effect: Snape was beginning to eye her again and had approached Regulus about her in the Slytherin common room one evening, in which he vaguely asked how she was doing.</p><p>("How I'm doing?" Hermione had echoed, incredulously, when Regulus told her.</p><p>He had shrugged his shoulders. "I know, right?")</p><p>But someone else noticed: James.</p><p>He was waiting for her the Friday morning following Lily's increased presence in her life, leaning against a wall close to the Ravenclaw common room but far enough away that it appeared as though he didn't know where the Ravenclaw dorms were (which was a lie). His arms were crossed, and his hair looked windswept, and there was something in his hazel eyes that made Hermione approach him cautiously.</p><p>"James," began Hermione slowly. "Morning."</p><p>He reached forward and tugged her close for a hug. "Good morning."</p><p>Hermione was still wary, even as she returned the squeeze. She drew back and looked up at him. "What's going on?"</p><p>James appeared hurt. "What makes you think something is going on?"</p><p>"You have this… <em>look</em> on your face," replied Hermione dryly.</p><p>Said face soured and his mouth pulled down. "I do not!"</p><p>Hermione raised her eyebrows in response, and James' scowl deepened into a pout. He stepped back, and took her hand, lacing their fingers together, as they began a slow walk toward the Great Hall for breakfast.</p><p>"So… you and Lily are talking again," he began, in what he clearly thought was a subtle prompt.</p><p><em>Gryffindors really don't do subtle,</em> thought Hermione with a grin. She quickly wiped it from her face when James glanced at her. "So we are."</p><p>"Is that… is that okay?" he asked, peering at her intently.</p><p>A warmth spread from Hermione's chest as she realized that he was worried about her and their previous encounter: the large blow-up that resulted in them not speaking for over a year.</p><p>Hermione squeezed James' hand. "Yeah, James. It's okay. We talked."</p><p>He let out a long exhale. "That's good."</p><p>At some point, he began to swing his hand, the one she was holding to, as they walked. They entered the Great Hall together and this time, only a few people glanced over and began to whisper. At this point, they were old news, but there were still quite a few who were watching them curiously. After all, it had been well known that James had wanted to date Lily for some time.</p><p>Hermione waved to Barty, who rolled his eyes and turned his back on them, eagerly shovelling food into his mouth. Opposite him but facing her at the Slytherin table, Regulus toasted her with his tea and then returned to staring intently at Barty – in some sort of game the two had invented, which apparently involved Regulus wiggling his eyebrows a lot.</p><p>"What in Merlin's name are they doing?" muttered James against her ear, his breath hot as he steered her to the Gryffindor table.</p><p>"I have no idea," replied Hermione, eyes wide even as she found herself sitting opposite Sirius and Remus at the Gryffindor table, with James at her side and directly opposite Sirius. Peter yawned from James' other side, having left them a gap at the bench.</p><p>"Morning Princess," greeted Sirius through a mouthful of toast. He bit down and then held out the slice of toast in a parody of one of their first interactions, two years ago. "Want a piece?"</p><p>James scowled and deliberately spooned some scrambled eggs on her plate, sniffing as he retorted, "No, she does <em>not</em>."</p><p>"<em>She</em> has a voice," grumbled Hermione, batting away James' hand as he tried to plate beans for her. "And <em>she</em> doesn't like beans on toast."</p><p>Remus offered a shy, slightly tense smile. It was one he often used around her – like she made him nervous. "Did you sleep well, Hermione?"</p><p>"As well as I usually do," she replied, elbowing James when he animated the sugar, honey, milk, and pumpkin juice all in one go with a wave of his wand. "Stop that." She turned back to Remus. "And you, Remus?"</p><p>"I'm feeling a bit under the weather," he admitted with a grimace.</p><p>"Yeah, it's Moony's time of the month," snickered Sirius.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes even as James comically, and loudly, shushed his friend. Instantly, a squabble broke out between the two.</p><p>"Don't you <em>shush</em> me, Potter!"</p><p>"Then try to be a bit more <em>discrete</em>, Padfoot!"</p><p>"I'm a fucking Gryffindor, <em>Prongs</em> – if you wanna talk about fucking discretion—"</p><p>"So, hey, Dumbledore's missing again," broke in Remus, raising his voice a bit over the two.</p><p>The group fell silent and as one, the four Gryffindors turned to look at the Head Table, where McGonagall glanced over, frowning down at them. Hermione, however, calmly dipped honey in her tea.</p><p>"<em>Prophet</em> came in earlier," began Peter quietly, his voice barely above a whisper. "There was another attack last night, against Bagnold."</p><p>"Is she alive?" asked Remus, just as quiet.</p><p>Peter nodded, and Sirius exhaled loudly in relief. "Thank <em>Merlin</em>. At least when she was at Hogwarts, she had a proper defence professor. It's been a joke for the last decade and I don't see much of our generation surviving once we graduate this year."</p><p>"Professor Merryweather is decent," argued Remus. "And she was an Auror."</p><p>"Yeah, but Proctor and Vorpe before her were lousy," reminded James. "Remember the incident with the knockback jinx that crossed with <em>gemino</em> with Vorpe?"</p><p>The four teens collectively winced, and Peter went as far as shifting on the bench. Hermione looked around curiously. "I didn't hear about that one—"</p><p>"No offense, Princess, but you were in your own little world back then." Sirius cleared his throat. "And I'm pretty sure Vorpe did his best to keep that as quiet as possible, given…"</p><p>Hermione stared at Sirius before looking around at the other teens; Remus busied himself with his tea, and James was staring at the enchanted ceiling like it held the answer to the universe. Peter caught her eye and his mouth pulled down into a frown.</p><p>"It was pretty bad," he confirmed with a slow, solemn nod.</p><p>"What I wouldn't <em>give</em> for a decent defence professor," sighed Sirius. "How am I supposed to join the Aurors without an EE in the class?"</p><p>Remus scoffed. "You'd get an EE with your eyes closed, Padfoot. It's your Charms grade I'd be worried about."</p><p>"Not true!" protested Sirius. "Besides, the N.E.W.T. examiners look for examples of exceptional wandwork and spells that would benefit the Auror Corps, especially with this Dark Lord the <em>Prophet</em> keeps going on about. I want to ensure I have a leg up against the competition when I enter the Corps."</p><p>"Unless you find yourself a tutor, I don't think you can dazzle them with your exquisite <em>lumos</em>," laughed Peter, pointing a finger at Sirius, who scowled in response.</p><p>But James was looking at Hermione, eyes wide behind his glasses.</p><p>"<em>You're</em> really good at defence," said James, not even thinking about it.</p><p>Hermione blinked at him, looking up from the tea she had been stirring. "Pardon me? How would you know?"</p><p>James, brain catching up to his mouth, sputtered, "Well – you know – I hear things—"</p><p>Sirius snorted.</p><p>"You hear things," echoed Hermione, staring at him.</p><p>James blushed. "Okay. So. I mean – there was Diagon Alley that one time—"</p><p>Hermione's lips tightened into a flat line.</p><p>"And, well… I kind of, erm…" James blushed a furious red and ran the rest of his words together quickly: "SawyouintheroomwithCrouch."</p><p>Hermione's eyes widened. Remus dropped his spoon, and Sirius laughed loudly, pounding at the table. Peter's mouth dropped open and he squeaked, "<em>Crouch</em>?"</p><p>James shot him a horrified look. "<em>Not</em> like that, Wormtail – I mean –" he turned back to Hermione. "When the two of you – defence – your spell—"</p><p>But Hermione's chest was tight with anger and betrayal. Her hands clenched tightly into fists, so hard that the skin around her joints was white. Her magic roared up, ready to be used and from the corner of her eye, she saw Sirius rear back with wide, grey eyes and exclaim, "Whoa, Princess, is there <em>lightning</em> in your hair?!"</p><p>"What." The word was ripped from her mouth before she realized she had spoken. It was icy, and even as she exhaled, for a moment, she thought her breath came out as mist.</p><p>James had his hands up in a placating gesture, but there was panic in his eyes even as he focused on Hermione. "I just meant, you're really good at defence—"</p><p>"Really good at a lot of things," muttered Sirius, but he was watching the two with intense eyes.</p><p>"—and I remembered the fight in Diagon Alley," continued James, stuttering a bit. "How well you fought against that woman before my dad and I jumped in—"</p><p>"But that's not what you meant," interrupted Hermione coolly. "Was it, Potter?"</p><p>Peter winced and hunched over, ensuring his entire body was hidden behind James'.</p><p>"Erm, well, no…"</p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes. "Then explain. Succinctly. <em>Quickly</em>."</p><p>James' eyes darted toward Sirius and Remus, looking for backup, but Remus merely turned to his mostly empty plate.</p><p>Sirius shrugged. "She's Reggie's mate, Jimmy. And she knows quite a few of our secrets already and hasn't ever said anything about them. What's one more?"</p><p>James sighed. "We have this map—"</p><p>"Map?" echoed Hermione, but then frowned. "Poincaré theory."</p><p>"I – what?" James blinked.</p><p>"A while back. We were talking about reference points in arithmancy. Poincaré." Hermione's eyes were sharp when she looked at James. "You used arithmancy with his theories of reference points to create a map of Hogwarts."</p><p>Peter's eyes were wide. "How did you…?"</p><p>"It's Hermione," answered Remus, as if that explained anything.</p><p>"It shows where everyone is, in real time," added Sirius, proudly. And he <em>was</em> proud of their accomplishment. "It's great for pranking, not like James is doing much of that recently…"</p><p>Horrified, Hermione turned to James. "You were <em>watching</em> me? When?"</p><p>"All the time," replied Sirius with a bit of a smarmy grin to his face.</p><p>"When I was in the <em>toilets</em>?" Hermione's voice rose shrilly.</p><p>James paled and then winced. "That… sounds a bit creepy when you put it that way."</p><p>"<em>You think?"</em></p><p>But then Hermione paused: hadn't Harry done something similar when they were on the horcrux run? Watching the map obsessively – saying it was to watch the Death Eaters in the school – but in reality, to keep an eye on Ginny?</p><p>She sighed. <em>Like father, like son, I guess…</em> but she did eye James up and watched for a moment as he squirmed under her glare. "Don't do it again. It's invasive and frankly, incredibly disturbing."</p><p>James leaned forward, reaching out and clutching at her hands with his, cupping them. "I promise, I swear," he babbled earnestly. "Marauder's honour."</p><p>She eyed him. "Isn't that what got you into this to begin with?"</p><p>Sirius laughed, and even Peter and Remus snickered when James looked a bit abashed. "But I did mean it – I saw you and Crouch. Practicing. And you're great, Hermione. You're a great teacher."</p><p>"She's that good?" asked Sirius, now eyeing Hermione as well.</p><p>She shook her head, tossing her hair a bit. "I'm really not – Barty and I know each other well. He takes instruction easily."</p><p>"She's phenomenal," spoke James over her, directly at Sirius. "She's already got nonverbal spells down, and her reactions are instinctive—"</p><p>Sirius looked over at Hermione appreciatively. "Care for another student, Princess?"</p><p>Hermione scoffed. "You'd actually listen?"</p><p>"<em>I'd</em> train with you," said James loyally. "And I'd listen to instruction."</p><p>"Yeah, okay, James," laughed Hermione, bringing her cup up to sip. Her eyes flickered at Sirius. "I'll tutor you in defence so can get into the Auror Corps. You'll even be able to cast a patronus when I'm done."</p><p>"Really?" Peter's eyes lit up. "Can I join?"</p><p>Taken aback, Hermione stuttered, "Y-yeah, of course—"</p><p>"How does Sunday sound?" added Remus, pulling out his planner. "There's no patrol scheduled for us that day—"</p><p>"Quidditch isn't on then, either," added James pleasantly.</p><p>Taken aback, Hermione's mouth dropped open as her eyes moved between the teens. "Well, that is to say, I wasn't really—"</p><p>"There's loads of empty rooms we can use," added Sirius enthusiastically.</p><p>"You would know!" laughed James.</p><p>Stunned, Hermione could only watch as the Marauders planned a study date with her for Sunday, for defence of all things. Lightly shaking her head, she took a deep breath and went back to her breakfast, sure that this would fizzle out well before the end of the weekend.</p><p>And yet, on Sunday, she and Barty met James Sunday evening outside of the Ravenclaw common room.</p><p>"Finally!" James sprung back up against the wall and bounded excitedly toward her, reaching forward, and sweeping her off her feet in greeting.</p><p>He swung her around even as Hermione laughed and cried, "Put me down, Potter!"</p><p>With that lopsided grin of his, James did so. But he also slid his hand up along her neck to cradle the back of her skull, tangling his fingers in her curls. He then leaned down and brushed his lips against hers – lightly, at first – and then with more pressure as he angled his head and Hermione pressed back.</p><p>"Annnnd that's enough of that."</p><p>The two broke apart, slightly breathless, to glance at Barty who was looking anywhere but at the two of them. When he finally glanced their way, he pointed asked James, "Don't we have somewhere to be?"</p><p>"Oh, right!"</p><p>James grabbed Hermione's hand and began tugging her down the hallway. Hermione tripped over her feet to match his stride, Barty's long legs keeping up easily as they continued their brisk pace to a part of the castle Hermione never really explored in either of her lives.</p><p>"And, <em>voila</em>, Hermione!" James said, theatrically as he swung the door open. "Your pupils!"</p><p>Hermione sighed, stumbling into the room behind James even as Barty brought up the rear and let out a long, low whistle of appreciation. She stumbled to a halt, mouth dropping open as she looked around the room.</p><p>She thought it would be a small tutoring session – Barty had even come just to wind up Sirius and make Remus uncomfortable, in a thrilling way of annoying them – but it wasn't just the Marauders in the long, rectangular room.</p><p>Regulus leaned against a desk by the far wall, Sirius straddling a chair backward beside him and trying to engage his little brother in conversation (although Regulus was doing an admirable job in giving one-worded answers).</p><p>Remus and Peter were sitting like students at two desks, and Remus even had parchment and a quill out for notes, while Peter was frantically skimming through their Defence text.</p><p>But Lily was there, at the opposite side of the room from Sirius and Regulus, with Marlene and Mary, and even the ditzy Phoebe Sinclair as she twirled a piece of her hair around her fingers.</p><p>Dirk grinned and waved from where he stood, near the other Gryffindors.</p><p><em>Ten,</em> thought Hermione, stunned. <em>Ten, not including Barty and Regulus. That's how many people showed up for a tutoring session. What. Is. Going. On.</em></p><p>"Might I present our instructor for the evening?" grandly began James, gesturing widely as he stepped back and let Hermione take center stage. "The amazing, magnificent, brilliantly clever and <em>my</em> talented girlfriend, Professor Evans!"</p><p>Sirius let out a loud catcall and even Peter and Remus took up loud clapping and cheers, with Dirk not far behind them. Lily beamed at her, even as her friends took their time to politely clap.</p><p>"I – what – I thought—" Hermione twisted to look at James. She hissed, "This was supposed to be a small tutoring session for your friends!"</p><p>"Yeah, about that…" James reached up and ran a hand through his hair, and weakly chuckled. "So… Cresswell overheard us, and then Lily did, and she told her friends… And I figured you would bring Crouch and Regulus…"</p><p>Hermione sighed, muttering something about redoing her lesson plan.</p><p>James winced. "Sorry?"</p><p>"It's fine," she murmured in reply, shoulders dropping a bit. Was this how Harry felt when she ambushed him in their fifth year?</p><p>"So, are we doing this or what?" called Sirius, loudly. "I wanna kick some dark wizard arse!"</p><p>Hermione stepped away from James and surveyed the group as they turned their eyes on her. She took a deep breath, fortifying herself for what she was <em>sure</em> was not going to be a single tutoring session.</p><p>She wasn't Harry – creating Dumbledore's Army was not in her plan and she wasn't really feeling charitable enough or close enough to the headmaster to recreate that. Perhaps if they kept it at its original name – the Defense Association – she could justify the connection to her past, but Hermione bled for Dumbledore, the Order, and for that cause once before.</p><p>If she was going to teach these people – her friends, her sister, their friends – to protect themselves from Death Eaters (none of whom had even reached near the peak of their depravity yet), then she had her work cut out for her.</p><p>There wouldn't be second chances.</p><p>It would be on <em>her</em> terms, this time.</p><p>With a slightly cool smile, Hermione brandished her wand, and began, "Alright then. Let's get started."</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC... </p>

  <strong>October 1977</strong>
</p><p>The first DA-but-not-DA meeting was utterly disastrous.</p><p>The second, third, and fourth weren't much better, but by the time they neared Halloween, Hermione thought they finally hit their stride.</p><p>Initially, Sirius was the most vocal – but certainly not the only one disappointed – when Hermione channeled her inner Harry and declared that their first lesson was <em>expelliarmus</em>. Even James's face had comically fallen.</p><p>"There's no point teaching you spells if you can't hit your target," she argued passionately, red in the face as Sirius scoffed.</p><p>"I thought this was a defense class, Evans, what good is going back to basics going to teach me?" he asked, tossing his wavy hair. He had his arms crossed with his wand in one hand and looked to be one more word away from tapping his foot as well.</p><p>Scowling, Hermione turned, walking toward Regulus and Barty, both who were struggling to hide their shit-eating grins. She ignored Sirius, who was still speaking.</p><p>"I get that she's your girlfriend, mate, but I think you oversold her capabilities—"</p><p>In a flash, Hermione had turned, wand drawn but held low against her hip. In the same motion, her spell hit Sirius. He yelped just as his wand was torn from his hand, protectively tucked against his bicep in his crossed arm position. It sailed through the air and Hermione caught it with a summoning charm.</p><p>"Does that answer your question?"</p><p>James's mouth was hanging open. "Bloody hell, that was quick…"</p><p>Sirius cleared his throat and wiggled his fingers at Hermione. He looked distinctly queasy without his wand. "My wand, please?"</p><p>Hermione wordlessly tossed it back at Sirius, who gripped it tightly and angled his body away from her. The rest of the room either moved closer to her or shuffled where they stood.</p><p>"Where's your wand?" asked Peter, rising from the desk. He was at such an angle he couldn't see her hand pressed against her thigh.</p><p>Hermione turned partially so he could see. "Here. Low, from my hip." Her mouth twisted a bit into a wry grin. "My gunslinger's move."</p><p>"I'll say," muttered Marlene, leaning forward with an interested gleam to her eyes. It was the most animated and positive Hermione had ever seen her act toward her. "Why not waist height or a typical dueller's stance?"</p><p>Hermione scoffed. "Dueller's stance? Please! What good are flourishes and honour in battle?"</p><p>Lily looked perturbed. "But it's the right thing to do…"</p><p>"In any other duel, yes," agreed Hermione, nodding at her sister. "In school, in a training exercise, not a problem. But if you're here because you want to know how to fight – and fight against what's going on out <em>there</em> – then bowing your head and using useless flourishes is only going to get you killed."</p><p>"But where's the honour in a fight like that?" asked James, frowning. He crossed his arms.</p><p>"Seriously, Potter?" Barty let out a bitter laugh. "Where was your <em>honour</em> when you'd bully the younger students in the halls? Where was your honour when you'd attack Snape for just – oh, what was the word that Pettigrew used? – <em>existing</em>, that's it!" He was breathing harder, now. "Where was your fucking <em>honour</em> that night—"</p><p>"Barty." Hermione's voice was firm but low. "That's enough. Not here."</p><p>Marlene, Mary, Phoebe, and Dirk were confused, their heads swiveling back and forth between Barty and James. Barty was red-faced, glaring hotly at James, whose shoulders were slumped.</p><p>Lily's mouth was open, like she was realizing that there was far more that had gone on that evening; that there was far more to Hermione's injuries than she had ever let her sister know. When her eyes shrewdly turned to Remus, Hermione knew she had begun to connect the dots.</p><p>"We are not here to rehash personal issues," said Hermione, quietly. "We're here to learn to fight."</p><p>That, plus Barty's heated words, seemed to sober the group, and everyone easily paired with someone else. Hermione, deciding that keeping Barty separate from the rest of the group would be best, partnered with him. She demonstrated her quick draw again but explained it had taken her years to get to that point, and that they should focus more on aiming true for the first little while.</p><p>Sirius and Regulus eagerly partnered – barely having the opportunity to spend time together – with matching, teeth-barred grins. Lily and Marlene partnered, leaving Remus, Dirk, Peter, and James to figure out who would go with whom; eventually, Dirk and Peter paired, and James paired with Remus.</p><p>After a few demonstrations, Hermione let Barty practice disarming her of her wand, despite both – and Regulus, for that matter – were beyond that in their own wand and spellwork. They couldn't practice their wandless magic, not with the others around, but Barty did try a few nonverbal <em>expelliarmus</em> attempts, which worked well.</p><p>After that session, Hermione moved them through Harry's old schedule, building up to the patronus – telling them to focus on a happy memory. "The stronger the memory, the stronger your patronus."</p><p>"What's yours then?" asked a curious Phoebe, twirling her blonde hair around a finger.</p><p>Hermione sighed. "A patronus is your guardian. Kind of an avatar of yourself in animal form." She caught the Marauders all share a glance. "In a way, it's private. I know I can cast the patronus, but I'd prefer not to share what mine looks like."</p><p><em>Mainly because I'm not sure it'll still be an otter,</em> she mentally grimaced. Surrounded by her sister, boyfriend, and their friends, most of whom were strangers to her, was not who she wanted around when she tried the spell. What if she didn't think it was an accurate representation of Hermione Evans? What if she didn't like what appeared? Tonks' had changed to a wolf when she fell for Remus – which was terribly problematic on its own, why hadn't Remus's patronus change to hers? – and Hermione wasn't sure she could handle her patronus being a doe. While she was happy with James, she didn't want to be defined by him.</p><p>"Has a patronus ever <em>not</em> been an animal?" asked Dirk, scratching at his chin with his wand.</p><p>Hermione winced at him, eyes trained on his wand. Something that sounded like Mad-Eye Moody thundered through her ears: <em>… will blow off your buttock, boy!</em> "Not to my knowledge. Why do you ask?"</p><p>He grinned. "Wouldn't it be <em>wicked</em> if your patronus was Luke Skywalker? Or- Or, like, <em>Merlin</em>?"</p><p>Hermione grinned back. "Let me know if that works for you."</p><p>Dirk settled into a determined face, his floppy hair getting in front of his glasses as he nodded and then scrunched his face up, clearly thinking hard of a happy memory.</p><p>Everyone watched eagerly, and then the sixth-year Gryffindor muttered, "<em>Expecto Patronum</em>," causing a tiny, tiny, white wisp to emerge from his wand.</p><p>There was exclamations of surprise and cheers, causing him to pop his eyes open. "Did I do it?"</p><p>"Almost!" Sirius raced forward and clapped Dirk hard on the shoulder, causing his glasses to slide down his nose and nearly trip forward. "That was brilliant! Me next!"</p><p>Sirius managed a wisp as well; as did Lily, James, and Phoebe. But Remus, Peter, Marlene, and Mary had trouble.</p><p>"It's not something that comes quickly," cautioned Hermione, trying to cheer them up. "And there could be many reasons for it: your memory isn't happy enough, or you don't have a full enough picture of the memory to hold on to. You might not be pushing enough magic into the spell, or your pronunciation is off. Practice is really the only thing that will work."</p><p>Remus and Marlene both looked determined while Peter looked a bit afraid of his own wand, staring at it. "I'll never get it…"</p><p>But Mary smiled and cheered the last Marauder up, placing a hand on his arm. "Sure you will, Peter! Like Hermione said, it takes practice. We can work together, in the Common Room, if you'd like."</p><p>Apparently, Peter did like, because he blushed and said a sincere thank you to the fellow Gryffindor, who seemed to blush back.</p><p><em>Who knew?</em> thought Hermione, fighting back a grin as she turned from the two Gryffindors. <em>Defense tutoring also doubles as matchmaking.</em></p><hr /><p>
  <strong>December 1977</strong>
</p><p>Petunia's flat was a dingy, tiny hole in the wall on an estate in Peckham, which made Hermione cringe a bit as her Granger-self subconsciously took center stage. Peckham was <em>very</em> different to Cheam, where she grew up – but a part of her, her Evans-self, shrugged and whispered <em>Peckham and Cokeworth aren't that different. Stop being such a snob.</em></p><p>Sean's father had parked his Vauxhall around the corner and was waiting – or guarding – the car while Sean, Petunia, and Hermione carried luggage and boxes up the five flights of stairs to their new flat, where James had the door propped open by an ugly, ornate vase in bright lime green.</p><p>Petunia eyed it as they approached, and James shrugged. "Sorry – it was the ugliest thing I could find, and I figured you wouldn't mind it being used as a doorstop."</p><p>Petunia sighed. "That's fine. Vernon Dursley gave it to me earlier today as a housewarming present. He said his mother picked it out."</p><p>Overhearing, Hermione choked from where she was bringing up the rear. "You still speak to that git?"</p><p>Petunia shot her a look. "He's in my advanced accounting class. He's really one of the best students, so I'd like to remain friendly to get his notes and study help."</p><p>Hermione turned to stare at Sean, who shrugged. "As long as he doesn't come around."</p><p>"Of course not," sniffed Petunia, sweeping past them into the flat.</p><p>In-between hauling boxes up and then unpacking, James, Hermione, Sean, and Petunia engaged in small conversation until the two men gravitated to each other and ended up in the bedroom, putting together the bed frame, while Hermione and Petunia were in the kitchen, sorting out the utensils in what cupboard or drawer.</p><p>"Peckham's very different to Cokeworth," began Hermione cautiously. "Are you going to be okay here?"</p><p>Petunia shot her a look. "The only difference is the number of high rises, Hermione." She paused. "And Cockney accents."</p><p>"Pet—" Sean poked his head into the kitchen, making both Evans girls turn to face him. He grinned. "James and I were getting hungry, so we're thinking of doing a food run. Anything you fancy?"</p><p>Petunia shrugged, and Hermione was the same. Sean dragged James with him out of the flat, the curious Gryffindor peppering him with questions as they left. Petunia and Hermione rummaged to find plates and rinsed them off, and by the time they were done setting the table after locating everything, the two had returned. James was wide-eyed.</p><p>"What's wrong?" asked Hermione to James as Sean put the carry-out bags in a free space on the counter.</p><p>"Some kid started off on him as we returned," answered Sean with a shrug.</p><p>"Is <em>that</em> what he said?" asked James, wondrous. "I couldn't understand a thing he said!"</p><p>"There was something about a fancy-dressed ponce and puffed-up nonce, but the rest wasn't worth repeating," grinned Sean. He held out a box to James who took it tentatively. "Noodles?"</p><p>James peered down at the box, staring at their dinner. There were <em>noodles</em> – as in, pasta – and then there were <em>noodles</em>, of the Asian variety, and it was clear that despite Sirius and James's rebellious nature, they hadn't wandered into Muggle London as much as they implied. Hermione bit back a grin and hid it behind her own Chinese takeout, taking the chopsticks Petunia passed her.</p><p>Eventually, the four were at the table, Sean passing cans around. Hermione held hers up in a toast, aimed at the two who were going to be living so far away from her, now. "To Sean and Petunia, and your first place together. Congratulations!"</p><p>James eagerly joined in, giving a rousing cheer that made Petunia blush.</p><p>"To Petunia," continued Sean, giving his girlfriend a soppy grin. "One year and a bit left into her program, and then she's – technically – a journalist. And to Pet, for finding that job at the private detectives' firm!"</p><p>"Here, here!" cheered Hermione, clonking her can against Petunia's. The eldest Evans sister was beet-red at this point.</p><p>"To Hermione," added James, grinning as everyone turned to him. "For being brave enough to say 'yes' to visit my parents this Yule."</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes while Sean snickered, and Petunia rolled her eyes. "I've met your parents before, berk."</p><p>"Not like this you haven't," he argued with the grin still on his face. Still, everyone had a sip of their beer.</p><p>Then, as the toasting trailed off, Sean squirmed in his seat and turned a bit red and pale simultaneously. "Erm. While we're here…"</p><p>Everyone turned to him.</p><p>He cleared his throat, turning in his chair to face Petunia. She blinked at him; her chopsticks suspended in the air above her meal. "Sean…?"</p><p>"Pet. Petunia." He cleared his throat again. "We've been… we've been together now, since year ten and you've been… you've been the best thing that happened to me. Every morning when I get up, you're the first thing I think about. You're who I want to spend my days with and when you're not around, I want to share everything I do with you the moment I see you. Moving in with you means you're the last thing I see before I go to sleep, too. Even seven years later, I learn something new about you, every day. I never want that to stop."</p><p>Petunia's eyes were misty and Hermione was frozen, staring wide-eyed as history changed in front of her. She was so nervous when Vernon Dursley appeared…</p><p>Sean slid off his chair and knelt. He fished a tiny box out of his trouser pockets, his hands shaking as he did so. He flipped it open.</p><p>Petunia gasped.</p><p>"Petunia," began Sean, his voice trembling, "Will you marry me?"</p><p>Hermione held her breath.</p><p>"<em>Yes</em>," breathed Petunia, and then said, louder, "Yes – yes, of course!"</p><p>She slid off her chair to kneel in front of Sean and threw her arms around his neck, and then they were kissing soppily between wide smiles and laughs. They were mumbling things to each other, private things that Hermione and James couldn't hear.</p><p>Hermione felt something touch her hand, and she glanced over to see James smiling at her. They linked fingers and he squeezed, gently.</p><p><em>Are you okay?</em> He mouthed.</p><p>Frowning, her brow furrowed, and James motioned with his free hand to her face. Confused, she put her chopsticks down and reach up. Her cheeks were wet. She was crying.</p><p>She blinked in surprise and then huffed a tiny laugh. Nodding, she mouthed, <em>Yeah. I'm fine. Thanks,</em> to him, grinning when she turned back to Sean and Petunia who were off the floor but had moved their chairs to be next to each other at the corner of the table, their thighs pressed together.</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat, getting the newly engaged couple's attention. "Congratulations Petunia, Sean!"</p><p>"Oh, Hermione!" gushed Petunia, standing and throwing herself at her sister. They hugged tightly. "You'll be my maid of honour, won't you?"</p><p>Stunned, Hermione could only nod.</p><p>James was saying something to Sean, shaking his hand and grinning widely. As Petunia pulled away, showing Hermione the ring, she could make out a bit of their conversation.</p><p>"—wanted to do it with Hermione around," Sean was saying. "Because of her being at boarding school, this was the only option—"</p><p>"—completely understand!"</p><p>"—would have done it at the Evans' over Christmas or New Years, but between the girl's tension is still a bit high—"</p><p>"Are you happy?" whispered Hermione to Petunia, looking into her blue eyes. "Is this what you want?"</p><p>Petunia beamed back; tears still caught in her eyelashes. "Oh Hermione…" she whispered, "I've never been happier."</p><p><em>Good, </em>thought Hermione. Something had changed – Petunia's engagement to Sean was tangible proof that her being in this time meant she could change things for the better. Hermione could save them – save Regulus, Barty, James, Lily, and so many more – and destroy Voldemort well before 1998.</p><p>Time was changing. And that was so, <em>so</em>, brilliant.</p><hr /><p>To visit the Potter estate, Hermione had to take the Knight Bus to Monmouthshire and then use the special portkey James had owled to her to bring her to the gates. Wales wasn't quite covered in snow the way that Cokeworth was – although, in the sad, industrial mining town, it was more slush – but the trees were bare and there was a mix of green and brown along the Valley, racing up the rolling hills and gorges of the valleys that made the area famous.</p><p>Leaving Wye for the Potter home was a whirlwind of secrecy and intense desire to know where Harry could have grown up. Godric's Hollow was on the coast, near Tintagel, and after that Christmas, Hermione had little interest in returning to the war memorial. But James's childhood home?</p><p>The portkey deposited Hermione on a chilly, foggy mountainside. The fog was dense, practically pea soup, thick and swirling at waist height. She could barely see in any direction around her, but within moments, hovering globes of light bobbed into soft existence high above her, driving the fog back to reveal a towering black gate in iron.</p><p>James stood on the other side, hands in his pockets as he grinned at her. "Hermione. Welcome to <em>Brigwyr</em> <em>Crochenwyr</em>."</p><p>Hermione boggled at him, at the near-fluent rolling of vowels and lack thereof in Welsh that rolled off James's tongue. "I beg your pardon?"</p><p>"Potter's Peak," he grinned, rocking back on his heels. He reached out and tapped the gates, once, with his bare fingers and they swung soundlessly open, dispelling the fog on the ground, and sending it flying up in ethereal wisps.</p><p>Shrewdly, Hermione slowly stepped forward, hearing the crunch of dead leaves under her boots. "Potter's Peak? Are we in Brecon Beacon, then?"</p><p>He nodded. "Ancestral Potter home. Our wards use the natural fog and magic does the rest to make sure no Muggles find us."</p><p>As she stepped over the threshold of the gate, the fog retreated and suddenly Hermione could see the entire Potter property stretch wide and far, along the sloping hills and rocky terrain of the large natural park.</p><p>There were no dead leaves under Hermione's boots once inside the property: instead, a gravel, tree-lined path led to a low, rectangular pond. The area around the pond branched off in four directions – north, south, east, and west. North, the direction they were heading in, led to the house; south was back to the gates.</p><p>James was exuberant as he pointed things out, walking with her toward his home. "So, here we have the topiary garden," he said, pointing east. "Although none of the flowers are in bloom – obviously – the garden maze is still fantastic to see. Nothing beats blindfolding Peter and sending a <em>confundus</em> at him and letting him loose in there!"</p><p>She turned to the west, opposite the garden. A thick, grey stone wall with an archway blocked much of the view, except for the tops of a clumped forest.</p><p>"See that gate?" asked James, and Hermione hummed in agreement. "There's a bunch of steps that lead down to the lower garden. Mum's got an Italian walkway garden, and a few ponds, including a koi pond that she <em>obsesses</em> over. She lost her marbles when Padfoot got into it last summer…"</p><p>Hermione did her best not to gape as James led her down the gravel path. There was a chill in the air, but nothing compared to the biting wind that was outside of the wards, and the property only had clumps of snow in certain shadowed patches. Otherwise, everything was green or brown.</p><p>As they approached the house, Hermione slowed to a stop and took a moment to take in the ancestral Potter seat. The Potters were an old name – maybe not as old as the Anglo-Saxon Blacks or the Macmillans – but they had been around since the 1300s and the house reflected that.</p><p>The house was long, rectangular with a distinct wing to the right and a wide, circular tower to the left of the house that climbed six windows tall, each growing narrower the further they went up. A weathervane was at the top, made of dark wrought iron. Closer to the tower was an extended entrance, butting out from the house at the same height but with a pointed, inverted V-roof facing the pond and gardens. There was a chimney poking from the roof of the entrance, as well as three more along the length of the right wing, and then a single, narrow one emerging from the circular tower.</p><p>The house was three-stories in height in a worn, weather-beaten grey stone, with a sloping, dark brown roof. Darker stones framed the windows and a single, large wooden door was recessed into the wall and covered by a pass-through arch. The house itself, while old and clearly added on over the centuries, had no medieval buttresses or tower walls for protection; however old the property was, it had never been used a fortress.</p><p>"Had your fill?" asked James, patiently. He stood with his hands in his pockets and was watching Hermione carefully, looking for her approval.</p><p>"It's gorgeous," she replied, glancing at him.</p><p>He flushed with pleasure. "C'mon, let's get inside. I'll show you the cottages on the property in the summer or some other time. Mum and Dad are wanting to see you again."</p><p>"In better circumstances, I'm sure," grinned Hermione, as James reached for her hand. They twined their fingers and he pulled her toward the double-doors, pushing them open.</p><p>Inside, the house was still decorated for Yule, with holly and mistletoe wrapped around pines above door frames. The interior of the entrance hall was wide but stunted, stretching right-to-left with sets of doors on either end. Directly in front of them, though, was a wide wooden staircase that split halfway up in a T-shape, turning again back on itself to reach the next level up.</p><p>"Ah, the swotty Evans arrives!"</p><p>Hermione glanced up to see Sirius grinning at her, strolling down one side of the stairs. "Hello, Sirius."</p><p>"Hey, Princess," he replied, eyes flickering to where James still held on to Hermione. His grin turned into a genuine smile and he stepped forward to give her a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek. "How was your Yule?"</p><p>"Well enough," she replied, and then dropped her voice to say, "Reg says 'hi.' He knew I was coming by but didn't think to risk sending anything along to you."</p><p>Sirius beamed.</p><p>From down the hall, through one of the open doors, a feminine voice called, "James? Is that her?"</p><p>The voice was followed by Dorea Potter, tall and regal in her witch's robes. Her hair was pulled back in an elegant bun. Charlus followed with a genial amble behind, shoulders back and the similar lopsided grin James wore on his face.</p><p>"Ms. Evans," began Dorea, stretching her hands out, "Welcome to Potter's Peak."</p><p>"Thank you for the invite, Mrs. Potter," replied Hermione, unsure to dip into a curtsey or shake her hand. Instead, Dorea just took the tips of her fingers in her hand and squeezed gently.</p><p>Charlus grinned at her. "Good to see you, Ms. Evans. How are your parents? Leo's been doing well, I hope?"</p><p>Perturbed – as she didn't know her father and Mr. Potter were friends – Hermione took a moment to reply. "As far as I know, they are, sir."</p><p>"<em>Sir</em>," snickered Sirius.</p><p>"James, why don't you show Ms. Evans around the house while I get tea set for us," suggested Dorea. She cast a stern glance at her niece's son. "Sirius can help me."</p><p>"<em>Auntie Dorea</em>," whined Sirius, jutting out his lower lip in a pout.</p><p>Grinning, James reached out and took Hermione's hand in his, tugging her toward the stairs. "C'mon!"</p><p>"Not too long, James," cautioned Dorea as she called after them, James already at the stairs with Hermione behind. "Thirty minutes or so, darling."</p><p>"Okay, mum!"</p><p>On the next landing, James turned and led her down a hallway, and then another, until they were in a large bedroom decked out in gold, red, and natural wood. It was clearly his bedroom.</p><p>"Wow," said Hermione, slightly deadpan. "It's huge."</p><p>"Erm, yeah, seems so," replied James, reaching up and ruffling his hair. He glanced around and wondered if he saw what Hermione saw: the large bed with red covers; the two large windows with pale yellow and golden pillows in the window seat; the large wardrobe, with one door still partially open and revealing the mess inside as James struggled to figure out what to wear that morning, knowing she was coming by.</p><p>Three broomsticks – one a child's size, another his first broom when he made the Gryffindor Quidditch team in his third year, and his 'at home' Cleansweep, were leaning against the wall. There was a stack of books on his desk, a few of her letters out, and even some discarded chocolate frog cards and boxes. He winced – those should have been cleaned up before she arrived.</p><p>"You're such a Gryffindor."</p><p>"What?" James glanced back to Hermione to see she was near his desk, leaning up a bit to look at a shelf that had a few Gryffindor paraphernalia: a Quidditch banner Remus and Peter had made for one of his first games, an old, frayed scarf he outgrew years ago, a porcelain lion Peter had gifted him one Yule. Between those items were several framed photos, all moving, of him and Sirius, him and his parents, or the Marauders together. There were a few of James himself playing Quidditch, or portrait shots.</p><p>"Proud of it!" he exclaimed in answer, instead. He paused. "Do you like being a Ravenclaw?"</p><p>"The perks of having a mini library in the common room is definitely a plus," she answered, although she side-stepped the question neatly.</p><p>Narrowing his eyes a bit, and letting that answer go, for now, James teased, "You know… like all purebloods, we have an extensive collection of hard-to-find books. It might even surpass the allure of a mini private common room library…"</p><p>"You have a library?" gasped Hermione eagerly, spinning to him. Her brown eyes were alight with pleasure and anticipation, and James's breath hitched.</p><p>She was the loveliest thing he'd seen, and she was standing in his bedroom. He swallowed, pushing down the emotions that were crawling up in his chest. Instead, he ducked his head a bit and grinned, glancing at her from under his fringe and over the edge of his glasses.</p><p>"Yeah, I figured we'd get there eventually," teased James. He gestured to the door, and together they left his bedroom.</p><p>"JAMES POTTER!" Dorea's voice shrieked through the manor.</p><p>At her side, James froze, paling. His eyes began darting around in terror.</p><p>Hermione cocked her hip and crossed her arms, fighting to keep a smirk off her face. "What did you do?"</p><p>"Erm…" James swallowed. "If I had done something – not that I <em>did</em> – then that something, may have, possibly, involved a time-released transfiguration on mum's favourite tea set."</p><p><em>That sounds rather tame,</em> thought Hermione with a frown, especially to warrant that kind of shriek from the Potter matriarch. Having raised James, and then half-raising Sirius, Hermione was expecting something much more involved.</p><p>"That's it?"</p><p>James winced. "Oh, er, no… not quite…"</p><p>"SIRIUS BLACK!" the voice continued.</p><p>The pounding of feet from above them had both James and Hermione look up at the ceiling, following with their eyes the track of sound until Sirius appeared, wide-eyed, bursting through the hidden panel of the servant's stairs.</p><p>"I think your mum drank the tea," he breathlessly confessed. He ran his hand through his curly hair.</p><p>"Tea?" asked Hermione suspiciously.</p><p>James choked off a moan while Sirius nodded. "It was meant for Moony and Wormtail when they visited, but, um… we kind of forgot…"</p><p>"Merlin, she's going to <em>Avada</em> me," whispered James. Behind his glasses, his hazel eyes were terrified. He turned to Hermione, the terror receding to leave a hardened, solemn look to him. He gripped Hermione's shoulders and stared at her.</p><p>"James…?"</p><p>"Hermione," he began. "Know that I have thought of you fondly. Remember me kindly."</p><p>Hermione blinked. "James – what–?"</p><p>Using his grip, he hauled Hermione close and gave her a bruising kiss, hard and tasting of apple cider. It sent sparks racing down Hermione's spine and she swore she heard her hair crackle.</p><p>He pulled back, slowly. Hermione's eyes fluttered open and she wondered when she closed them, deaf to Sirius' pleas for James to stop snogging her; the world had fallen away.</p><p>Then he and Sirius sprinted for the stairs, leaving Hermione alone on the third floor, blinking in stupefaction.</p><p>Swallowing thickly, Hermione's cheeks reddened, and she muttered to herself, "Gosh!" Alone, she mentally shrugged and turned on a wobbly heel toward the stairs herself, searching out something to do or someone to speak to.</p><p>Dorea found Hermione in the library thirty minutes later. The woman was furious, her dark hair flowing loose from her earlier updo; her cheeks were sharp, and her light blue eyes were angrily flashing as she stomped into the cozy room.</p><p>For a breathless moment, Hermione froze, thinking Bellatrix stood before her. Every instinct was telling Hermione to take up her wand and fight or flee.</p><p>Then Dorea caught sight of Hermione. She closed her eyes and her anger washed away, leaving the cool pureblood façade Hermione knew the Blacks were particularly good at projecting. There was even a chance that she was Occluding to keep her emotions at bay.</p><p>"My apologies, Ms. Evans," began Dorea stiffly, the only remaining hint of her ire. "But James and Sirius's prank for their friends caught me rather unaware and reacted poorly with me."</p><p>"You don't need to explain," replied Hermione, her tense muscles starting to loosen as her fight or flight instincts waned. "They once soaked me head to toe. Caused my magic to react poorly – and of course, it was through my hair."</p><p>Dorea stifled a chuckle. "You do have a head full of curls. Do you use Sleakezy to tame them?"</p><p>"Sometimes," admitted Hermione, "But I found over the years to just let my hair do what it wants."</p><p>"Forgive me," the woman began, carefully, "But from James's descriptions of you in his letters home, I always had the impression that you weren't the easygoing type of girl. Sirius even mentioned something about a study schedule?"</p><p>Hermione flushed.</p><p>Dorea looked at her knowingly, the tiniest smile on her lips. "Walk with me, Ms. Evans?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>They left the library and meandered down hallways until they went through a side door that led to one of the tiered gardens. Dorea's pace was relaxed, and Hermione, who was used to moving <em>fast fast fast</em>, struggled a bit. They ended up strolling along a long, dirt path enclosed by a lattice pagoda, with some brown twigs and winding vines, as well as some magical everblooms in soft blue and silver.</p><p>"Do you have plans past Hogwarts?" asked Dorea.</p><p>Hermione glanced at her. "I'm a sixth year – I haven't thought about it yet."</p><p><em>If I'll even be alive,</em> she thought grimly, looking away.</p><p>"It's never too early to think of your future."</p><p>Hermione wanted to laugh. All she ever <em>did</em> was think about the future, it seemed.</p><p>What followed was Dorea questioning Hermione: What is your favourite subject? What are your thoughts on arithmancy? How is James progressing in it, and will he do well on his N.E.W.T.? What are Lily's plans after Hogwarts? She has another sister, a Muggle one, what is she doing? Oh, recently engaged – do the women in her family marry young? Is it the same gentleman that Charlus met years ago? What do her parents think of Petunia's fiancé? Does James like him – have they had conversations? Do her parents like James?</p><p>At first, Hermione was confused but readily answered. However, as the questions continue – and the end of the compacted dirt path seemed further away than ever – Hermione began to grow wary. She knew it was awkward that James had been interested in Lily before her, but Hermione could honestly say she didn't put herself out there for dating and never meant to catch James Potter's eyes.</p><p>Dorea seemed to catch on to Hermione's unease toward the end and finally slowed her walk to stop, turning to face the young Ravenclaw. "Ms. Evans," she began slowly, carefully, "You must understand. My son was persistent in a relationship with your sister for many years. 'Lily this' and 'Lily that' was all that we heard from him and Sirius for quite some time. Then, suddenly, it stopped. <em>You</em> were his focus."</p><p>The woman frowned. Although she wasn't cool or accusing, Hermione still felt vaguely trapped. "James is my son, Ms. Evans. I would do <em>anything</em> for him, and I want to ensure his happiness. I won't have him trapped in anything."</p><p>Hermione gapped. "I didn't – I haven't – I promise that I didn't <em>do</em> anything—"</p><p>"I know," replied Dorea, evenly. "I've had ample time since we began our walk to search you for any spells or talismans, and James has been away from you long enough that any potion neutralizers could take effect."</p><p>A frown pulled at Hermione's mouth, and she wondered if she should be insulted or admiring at Dorea's Black-like paranoia. She chose to be admiring, for James's sake.</p><p>"Mrs. Potter," began Hermione, carefully as she fidgeted with her hands and twisted the fingers around, "<em>Please</em> – the only thing that I've ever wanted for any Potters—"</p><p>Here, she paused, looking away to hide her tears as her heart cried out, painfully, <em>HARRY</em>. She bit the inside of her cheek and tasted copped. She looked up and met Dorea's eyes. "All I've <em>ever</em> wanted was for Potters to be happy. To be safe. I promise you that."</p><p>The blood inside her mouth felt hot and tasted like a vow.</p><p>Dorea searched her face for a long moment, then nodded. Something softened in her. "I know, my dear. I know."</p><p>They resumed their walk, and finally – finally – they reached the end of the path. Dorea turned and they moved back toward the house, entering through a conservatory that doubled as an indoor potions garden, and then through a mudroom to the kitchen.</p><p>Eventually, the two found James, Sirius, and Charlus in a large sitting room, laughing about something that the two women had no knowledge of.</p><p>"Dory, darling!" Charlus leaped to his feet. "The boys have something to say to you—"</p><p>James and Sirius also rose, tripping over themselves to apologize for the prank, which Dorea sniffed but accepted graciously. She moved further into the room, leaving Hermione hovering a bit awkwardly at the door.</p><p>"Hermione," grinned James, moving toward her to usher her to the couch where he was sitting. Hermione smiled back and followed.</p><p>"Not there, Hermione," said Dorea, making James pause. She patted the empty cushion next to her. "I think we should punish my son a bit longer, don't you think, dear?"</p><p>Hermione laughed at James's stupefied face, even as he whined about it being unfair and wanting to sit next to his girlfriend.</p><p>Dorea sent him a look. Loudly, she said, "Now, Hermione, has James ever told you about the time when he decided to be a lion?"</p><p>James's eyes went wide. "Mother, <em>no</em>!"</p><p>"Oh?" asked Hermione, sinking into the free spot next to Dorea.</p><p>A house elf popped in a tea set and Dorea began serving it out while Sirius reached for a biscuit, grey eyes alight with intrigue.</p><p>"James was four," began Dorea, her tone light. "And since he was a lion, lions don't wear clothes so neither did he…"</p><p>Dorea turned the tiniest amount toward Hermione, sending her a conspiratorial wink that went missed behind James's loud bluster and embarrassment, even as Sirius and Charlus began teasing him.</p><p>Hermione hid her grin behind her teacup, completely relaxed for the first time since she stepped foot at Potter's Peak.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>January 1978</strong>
</p><p>Once they were all back at Hogwarts for the year, Lily approached Hermione with a hesitant request.</p><p>Hermione stared. "<em>You</em> want to do a birthday lunch in Hogsmeade? During the school week? Skipping classes?"</p><p>Flushing red, Lily dragged her toe along the floor of the library. "Well, yes. It's been… a few years since we celebrated anything together without mum and da enforcing things, so I thought…"</p><p>Hermione slowly nodded. "You could invite Tuney, too, you know. She'd come."</p><p>"To a <em>wizarding</em> village?" asked an astonished Lily.</p><p>"She <em>is</em> our sister," replied Hermione, pointedly. "Do you think she wouldn't want to celebrate your eighteenth birthday?"</p><p>Lily frowned. "She wasn't very nice when she learned she didn't have magic, 'Mione. Remember? She called us freaks."</p><p>"Don't call me that. You also went behind her back <em>with Snape</em> and snuck into her room to find the letter she sent Professor Dumbledore," retorted Hermione, raising her eyebrows. "Do you think she appreciated you invading her personal space or private correspondence? Did you ever ask her <em>why</em> she was so upset at you going to Hogwarts?"</p><p>"Isn't she upset at us <em>both</em>?" muttered Lily, but she sighed and ran a hand through her long, red hair. "I'll think about it."</p><p>Hermione couldn't force Lily and Petunia to work together or be around each other. She would push when she could, but – a part of her realized – it was entirely possible that Lily and Petunia's relationship was too fractured to be healed.</p><p>So, Hermione found herself sneaking into Hogsmeade with Lily, using the secret passage behind the mirror. While it was blocked by rubble and debris in her time, the tunnel opened up to the caves above the wizarding town, near where Sirius used to hide out as Snuffles when visiting Harry in the alternate future Hermione came from. It was a long, winding tunnel, but a very secure and hidden exit and she filed it away for future use.</p><p>Lily chattered as they wandered down from the hills into town, enjoying the lightly falling snow as they headed to the Three Broomsticks. Madam Rosmerta didn't bat an eye when they walked in – most likely used to upper years sneaking into the village – and Lily grabbed their warmed butterbeer while Hermione secured a table from the busy lunch crowd.</p><p>While they waited on food, Hermione began their conversation. "Have you had thoughts about what you want to do when you graduate?"</p><p>Lily made a face. "Well, it's not like uni is in the cards now, is it?" She wrapped her hands around her warm bottle. "I was thinking something to do with Charms. Professor Flitwick says I'm a natural, but I also love potions…"</p><p>"Is there any way to combine the two?" asked Hermione, knowing that there was but not giving Lily any clues.</p><p>"Probably," her elder sister admitted, "But that would be more Severus's wheelhouse than mine. I was thinking of maybe doing a Charms apprenticeship if I could. Or going into delicate charm work for a jeweler. There's one in Diagon Alley—"</p><p>"Yeah, the one that is owned by the Shafiq's, right? Their other business than Scrivenshaft's?"</p><p>Lily nodded. "That's it! But they're really picky about who they hire."</p><p>"You have the grades for it—"</p><p>"Not like <em>your</em> grades, Hermione—"</p><p>Hermione waved her words off. "You'll do fine. You're not already stressing about your N.E.W.T.s, are you?"</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes. "Of <em>course</em>, I am! It's not like I've taken them before."</p><p>"As someone who <em>has</em>, I think you'll be fine," replied Hermione easily. Lily scowled and Hermione grinned, picking up her fork to dig into her meat pie.</p><p>The rest of their lunch passed, with Hermione leaving the galleons to cover the meal as a birthday treat for her sister. Taking advantage of being away from Hogwarts, the two left the Three Broomsticks and walked the high street, looking into store windows and popping into Honeydukes for sweets.</p><p>Hermione was absently sucking on a sugar quill when Lily sighed happily, stretching her arms above her head: "This was <em>lovely</em>. We should do this more often – we haven't had much of an opportunity to chat before!"</p><p>Uncharitably, <em>well, whose fault is that?</em> flew through Hermione's mind before she clamped down on the negative thought; she grimaced, glancing away.</p><p>"It was nice," she admitted quietly. And it had been. "We could do it next year – make it a new tradition."</p><p>Lily's green eyes lit up. "<em>Ooo</em>, I like that! Birthdays at the Broomstick! Yours would be next, in September."</p><p><em>If we're ignoring Tuney, sure,</em> thought Hermione, but she hummed her agreement. Hermione slanted her amber eyes, catlike, at her sister and teased, "Would it be difficult, for you, I mean? You'll be an adult, doing adult things in an adult world."</p><p>Lily scoffed, tossing her hair. "I think I can manage."</p><p>"Then I'll already book it into my calendar," grinned Hermione.</p><p>Lily groaned. "Oh, yes, that color-coded thing."</p><p>"That <em>thing</em> has ensured my excellent grades, sister dear," replied Hermione with an arched eyebrow. Her tone was lofty and snobbish. "Don't mock it."</p><p>"I would <em>never</em>," gasped Lily, in mock affront as she brought her hand to her chest. Her eyes were wide, and then she broke character as she giggled. With a soft look, she reached around Hermione's coat and pulled her sister into her side, hugging her tightly.</p><p>"I missed you," she breathed into Hermione's curly hair. "I missed this."</p><p>Hermione closed her eyes, breathing in Lily's scent of parchment, ink, and her flowery fragrance. "Me too, Lils. Me too."</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>June 1978</strong>
</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>On the first day of June, Hermione sat with Barty in the Quidditch stands. She felt, for the first time ever, her actual age of seventeen instead of what should really be sixty-four (she was <em>old</em>!), as she leaned forward and ogled James's butt in his Quidditch trousers. The light tan stretched along the muscle of his thighs and rear as he leaned forward over his broom, the quaffle tucked into the crook of his arms.</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>"It only took six years," lamented Barty with a sigh.</p><p>"What took six years?" Her eyes did not leave James's form as he dipped and soared, avoiding bludgers. He tossed the quaffle to Sirius, who caught it and zoomed forward toward Hufflepuff's keeper.</p><p>Barty eyed her. "You turning into a girl."</p><p>Affronted, Hermione turned to him and snapped, "I've always been a girl, Barty!"</p><p>"Not a typical one," he argued mildly. "You never were into makeup, and you never got all dolled up for dates at Hogsmeade."</p><p>She rolled her eyes and then leaped to her feet to cheer when Gryffindor scored. When she sat, she muttered, "Girls don't have to like makeup. And we don't always need to be pretty. I know how to dress up, you know."</p><p>Barty's lack of reply made her think he was skeptical of that assessment.</p><p><em>Arse,</em> she thought.</p><p>Then the Gryffindors near them were on their feet, roaring. Gryffindor's seeker, Perkins, had caught the snitch and Gryffindor won against Hufflepuff, 450 to 120. They had won the Quidditch Cup, and for James, as captain, it was a sweet victory to end his year on.</p><p>Hermione and Barty stood in the Ravenclaw stands, clapping and whistling their approval of Gryffindor's win when James sailed by on his broom. His hair was more windswept than normal, his cheeks were flushed red from the game and win, and his hazel eyes were sparkling.</p><p>He extended a hand to Hermione. "Milady?"</p><p>She stared at it. In a previous life, she was terrified of heights, despite riding on thestrals, hippogriffs, and dragons. But Hermione Evans was not Hermione Granger, and she had come to appreciate the differences her new life provided.</p><p>Barty boosted her up, arms around her legs as he helped her to the barrier, and with James's help and careful positioning, Hermione climbed on to the broom behind her boyfriend, clutching tightly at his chest. She buried her face into his warm back.</p><p>They began to lazily spiral away from the stands, through the air and toward the still exuberant Gryffindor team hollering like crazy. Sirius even had the Quidditch Cup held above his head, using his knees to turn his broom in loopy eight's.</p><p>James placed a warm, gloved hand over hers. He turned his head, and she felt more than heard him say, "Don't worry, Hermione. I won't let anything happen to you."</p><p>And somewhere, deep in her heart, she thought, <em>I know you won't.</em></p><hr /><p>Then it was the morning of the Hogwarts Express returning to London, and Hermione found herself in the Room of Requirement with Regulus. The two were staring at the Diadem from a distance, each wondering how to proceed.</p><p>Regulus crossed his arms and frowned. "Iron would hold it better, I think."</p><p>"I agree." She paused and glanced at him. "Are you going straight to the Haberdashery?"</p><p>"No. Mother's hosting a dinner for my return this year," sighed Regulus. "I don't think I will be able to get away for a week or so."</p><p>Hermione grimaced. "I don't fancy the idea of a Horcrux being at Grimmauld Place, to be honest."</p><p>"Neither do I."</p><p>They fell silent.</p><p>"Would it be safe at yours?" asked Regulus, a hesitant tone to his voice. Hermione glanced at him. He was frowning, but there was concern written on his face. "With your Muggle family, I mean."</p><p>"Maybe," admitted Hermione slowly. "Petunia's in London; Lily and I have our own rooms now, and I think she's moving out this summer to stay with her girlfriends. Then it's just my parents and I."</p><p>"Would they… snoop?"</p><p>Hermione laughed. "No. They both respected my privacy since I was old enough to demand it, I guess." She nodded decisively. "I'll take the diadem then, and we'll get together early this summer at the Haberdashery to destroy it."</p><p>With that agreement, Regulus carefully levitated the Diadem off the cabinet, and Hermione held open the iron container they were using, the lid pulled back far enough that she wouldn't accidentally touch the Horcrux.</p><p>Once it was in the container, she slammed the lid shut. Both Regulus and Hermione were breathing heavily by the end, a thin sheen of sweat on their faces. Regulus pulled out a handkerchief and delicately dabbed at his forehead.</p><p>Hermione scooped the container up and swung her schoolbag around to her front. It was the two-point-oh version of her beaded bag, charmed to only be opened by her and nearly bottomless with her expansion charm.</p><p>"I can't imagine going after one of these on my own," he muttered as they stood.</p><p>Hermione glanced at him sharply. "Don't. Ever. If you get a lead—"</p><p>"Oh, I won't," he replied back, grimly. He was a bit pale-faced. "After the lake, and this? No, thank you. Groups it is."</p><p>Hermione pressed her lips thin and looked away. <em>Your original fate hasn't happened. It </em>won't<em> happen,</em> she thought, keeping her eyes on her bag instead of her friend. There was no way that Regulus would die again.</p><p>They left the Room of Requirement in quiet, both lost to their own thoughts but stopped just past the door as it melted back into the wall.</p><p>Hermione looked around at the deserted hallway, and asked Regulus, "Are you sure it's still safe to be seen with me?"</p><p>"Well, if <em>he's</em> at the dinner tonight, at least I can report you didn't do any amazing magic this year," grinned Regulus, although it was shaky at best. "So, until he thinks you're not useful to cultivate, then… yes."</p><p>Hermione sighed.</p><p>"Cheer up," began Regulus, nudging her with his shoulder. "One more year and then we don't have to worry about playing around. We can go on the offensive."</p><p>"Which means I need to come up with more plans," said Hermione wryly. "Yes, thanks, leave it all up to me."</p><p>"You <em>are</em> the brains."</p><p>"<em>Thanks,</em> Reg." She paused and asked as they began walking again, "What does that make you?"</p><p>"Me?" He thought for a moment. "The heart. I hold all the belief in you and what we're doing."</p><p>Hermione went silent, both flattered by his conviction and the emotional depth. Regulus was always so quiet and unassuming, keeping a façade up for the world to see. But he was emotional with her and Barty, with the Black temper kept firmly locked until it was necessary – and she still hadn't seen what Regulus could unleash.</p><p>"And Barty?"</p><p>Regulus sent her a dry look. "Do you need to ask, Hermione? He's the hands. <em>Your</em> hands. He's the sword to your shield, the wizard who will step in front of you in defense, in offense."</p><p>Hermione's heart clenched at the idea of Barty stepping in front of her to take a spell. She didn't want that for him or Regulus. Another part of her bristled at the implied sexism, and cut her eyes at Regulus, opening her mouth, but he cut her off.</p><p>"Not like that." He rolled his eyes. "You know what I mean. Barty thinks you hung the moon."</p><p>Hermione grumbled a bit under her breath, letting the topic drop for now. Instead, she asked, "Are you going to join me with James and the others this afternoon?"</p><p>Regulus cringed.</p><p>"Oh, come <em>on</em>," cajoled Hermione, leaning up into Regulus's space. "If anyone asks—" They both knew who she was talking about. "—you can say that I begged it. See? I'm begging, Reg."</p><p>He sighed, eyes rolling up to the ceiling. "Fine. But good luck getting Barty to agree."</p><p>"You just said he thinks I hung the moon," she replied smugly. "I think I can convince him to join us for about thirty minutes. I think that's fair."</p><p>"Yes, I suppose it is. Potter <em>is</em> courting you, after all, and if his mind is heading toward marriage, then Barty will have to get used to him and my brother being around," agreed Regulus.</p><p>Hermione tripped over nothing. "Marriage? I'm seventeen, Reg!"</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"B-but—"</p><p>"<em>Pureblood,</em> Hermione," sang Regulus in a light tease. "He may support Muggle rights and his family might be considered blood traitors, but Potter's mother is my great-aunt and a Black. He knows our way of life."</p><p>Hermione kept silent, lost in her thoughts, well beyond where they separated to the Ravenclaw and Slytherin dorms.</p><p>Was James really that serious? The thought remained on her mind, hovering at the front.</p><p>Somehow, Hermione convinced Regulus and Barty to share a compartment with the Marauders. They wouldn't stay long – there was no way leaving Barty and Sirius anywhere near each other wouldn't end in bloodied knuckles or death threats, and they only needed one enthusiastic Sacred Twenty-Eight member to snitch on Regulus, despite what orders Voldemort gave him – before returning to a carriage of their own.</p><p>Upon entering the train, she and Barty claimed a compartment on the Hogwarts Express to use once he had used up all his patience in dealing with Sirius. Then, they went looking for James and his friends.</p><p>"There you are!" greeted Sirius once they slid open the door. Regulus was already there, a put-upon look of long-suffering on his face as Pettigrew and James finished a loud game of exploding snap.</p><p>"Hello. Room for two more?" she asked, stepping in.</p><p>"Hermione!" James leaped to his feet, dislodging the cards. At least three exploded, causing Pettigrew to cry out in alarm and one caught the edge of James's trousers. It caught on fire. "Shit!"</p><p>Sirius's laughs, loud barks, dominated the noise of the carriage as James tried to stamp out the fire with his hands, Pettigrew hovering around him.</p><p>Regulus caught Hermione's eyes and Barty sighed loudly beside her, crossing his arms and sending her a look that plainly read, <em>must I?</em></p><p>Remus was doing absolutely nothing, enjoying the spectacle, so Hermione pulled out her wand and muttered, "<em>Aguamenti</em>."</p><p>A thin stream hit the bottom of James's trouser leg and doused the tiny sparks of flame left over.</p><p>He grinned at her, even as Hermione and Barty both sat on the seats opposite Sirius and Regulus and Remus. "Thanks, Hermione!"</p><p>"Are you a wizard or not, Potter?" she asked, rolling her eyes.</p><p>"'Course I am! But I figure that even a dashing figure like myself needs to be rescued by his fair maiden," he declared, flopping down next to her and tossing an arm around her shoulders. He tucked her in next to him and kissed her temple. She felt the curl of his lips and knew he was smiling.</p><p>Pettigrew clambered off the floor and squeezed into the space by the window next to Remus, leaving the four tightly packed compared to the three of them on the other seat. A conversation of summer plans and future careers dominated the first twenty minutes.</p><p>"You won't forget me, now that I'm not at the castle, will you?" teased James.</p><p>"It'll be easy to forget without the school-wide pranks and loud declarations every time you walked into the Great Hall," teased back Hermione, curling up next to James on the seat.</p><p>He preened, tilting his chin up and running a hand through his hair. "Yeah, we had some great times at Hogwarts, didn't we?"</p><p>"The very best," agreed Sirius loudly, cheering. Regulus sat next to him, opposite James and Hermione; Barty sat next to Hermione with Remus and Peter squished next to Sirius and the window.</p><p>"I wonder what the future will bring us now," mused Remus.</p><p>"Good times, Moony, only good times," replied Sirius with an easy grin.</p><p><em>I really hope so,</em> thought Hermione, looking around the compartment. In another time, out of the six wizards that she was with, three were marked Death Eaters. James and Sirius would think Remus was a spy, a traitor, until it was too late to realize their mistake.</p><p>All of them were dead—and Hermione certainly considered Barty's vegetative soul-sucked state to be as good as.</p><p>The war had ravaged them, in one way or another. Hermione had taken on a heavy responsibility for Regulus and Barty, already diverting Regulus's path once; but, even acknowledging her place in this time, knowing that Harry would never be born to Lily and James Potter…</p><p>Could she actually change it all? Could she actually save them? Stop the war and Voldemort before it got to the point that it was in 1981? Avoid the second rising altogether?</p><p>Despite Sirius's assurance, Hermione was certain "good times" were far off in the horizon. "Bad times" were much closer to reality than he realized.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>July 1978</strong>
</p><p>The day of Petunia's wedding was warm and humid. The church they decided on in Cokeworth was a bit crumbly, a bit neglected, but it was filled to the brim with people from both their lives, all there to see Petunia and Sean get married.</p><p>Two of Petunia's friends from school – Emma and Moira – were bridesmaids, and Hermione was her maid of honour. She took the job seriously, fussing with Petunia's veil and triple-checking all the flower arrangements earlier that day, much to Lily's amusement, who had accompanied her on the trip down into town.</p><p>But now everything was perfect for Petunia's day, just the way she wanted it. So, Hermione followed Emma and Moira down the aisle, leading the way for Petunia behind. From the corner of her eyes, Hermione caught sight of James, sitting with her parents on the bride's side. He grinned at her as she passed.</p><p>The wedding itself was a blur – Petunia looked radiant in her dress and in Hermione's mind the only problem with it was its very distinct 1970s look – and Sean did his best to hide his tears during their vows; and then the next thing she knew, Hermione was standing outside the church with her parents waiting for photographs while the rest of the guests moved to the Bowes' home – which was much larger than the Evans' – for the reception.</p><p>It was different from what Hermione remembered of the other weddings she attended in her previous life: it didn't have the same desperate energy that came with Bill and Fleur's, or the intimate and loving atmosphere of Harry and Ginny's, or the many others she experienced – but there was something sweet and pure in Petunia's face as Sean carefully fed her some of their wedding cake.</p><p>Petunia had kindly placed James at the head table with Hermione, despite not part of the wedding party, and due to that and his respect and the fact that he liked Petunia, James had been well-behaved for the entire night, acting the consummate gentleman and fetching drinks for Rose when she asked, or attending Hermione's grandmother and charming her enough so that the usual taciturn woman <em>winked</em> at Hermione when James's back was turned.</p><p>"So," he began, slightly nervously, which immediately had Hermione turn a wary eye on him. He was fidgeting in his seat next to her, arm strung along the back of hers while he bounced one leg.</p><p>"So?" asked Hermione.</p><p>"If I said that I might have… possibly… potentially… have a wizarding surprise for Petunia and Sean – would you be upset?" he bit his lip.</p><p>Hermione's eyes narrowed. "What kind of surprise?"</p><p>"The exploding kind?" James winced.</p><p>Sitting up in her seat, Hermione exclaimed, "What!" just as a whizzing noise burst from the far end of the backyard, near the treeline that backed onto a farmer's field. Guests stopped speaking and turned in the direction.</p><p>For one wild moment, Hermione's heart pounded furiously, and she half expected Kingsley Shacklebolt's patronus to appear and announce, "The Ministry has fallen," just as Death Eaters descended upon the guests. But another whizz sailed up through the air and the two exploded in a riotous burst of silver and gold. Spinning wheels in Petunia's wedding colours followed next, making the guests <em>ooh</em> and <em>aah</em> through the performance. The next pattern was a heart with a <em>P</em> and <em>S</em> entwined inside it, making the crowd gasp in delight.</p><p>"James…" Hermione trailed off breathlessly, eyes turned up to watch the designs and swirls that could only be created with magic, delighting the guests who weren't 'in the know.' From the corner of her eye, she saw Lily torn between disapproval and awe; her parents were cuddled together and enjoying the fireworks. Petunia and Sean were both basking in the colourful glow of the performance, and there was the slightest sheen to Petunia's eyes.</p><p>She turned to look at the teenager at her side. He was watching her, not the fruit of his labour. There was something soft in his eyes. Hermione's heart skipped a beat, and there were butterflies in her stomach. "Hermione, I—"</p><p>The firework display ended, and the crowd burst into loud, generous applause.</p><p>Petunia raced over, throwing her arms around James, nudging Hermione aside. Sean followed a bit more leisurely and caught the end of Petunia's mumbled <em>thank you</em> against James's shoulder.</p><p>Thrown, the Potter heir patted her back, throwing a frantic look at Sean. "You're welcome, Petunia – I really hope you liked them—"</p><p>"They were <em>beautiful</em>!" She wiped at the tears gathering in her eyes.</p><p>"Totally awesome, mate," added Sean, shaking James' hand enthusiastically. "I've never seen fireworks do that before!"</p><p>James chuckled weakly, shooting a look at Hermione, who pressed her lips together to keep silent.</p><p>Petunia drew back and sent a look – one that read <em>oh, really?</em> – at James, and then turned to Hermione. "We're going to head out soon—"</p><p>"Oh, is it time already?" asked Hermione in dismay. "I barely had a chance to see you tonight."</p><p>"Our flight is in a few hours," apologized Sean, placing a hand low on Petunia's back. "My dad's going to drop us off at the airport." He glanced at his new wife. "And then a week in Spain before we're back to reality."</p><p>Hermione made a noise but reached forward and hugged Petunia tightly. "I'm so happy for you," she whispered in her sister's hair, pressing a kiss to her cheek.</p><p>"I'm happy, too," whispered back Petunia, squeezing Hermione extra hard. She drew back. "But I'll be home before you know it, and you'll have to come by and visit us when we are."</p><p>There was a glimmer of something in Petunia's eyes when she said the sentence, skipping her blue eyes toward Sean and then James, her thin eyebrows raising expectantly, and Hermione caught on.</p><p>"Are you sure?" she asked carefully.</p><p>Petunia nodded. "I don't want to keep this from him anymore."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>The two Evans turned to look at Sean and James, who were exchanging jokes good-naturedly, but when Hermione heard James say something about "ball and chain," she quickly intervened by moving to his side and taking his hand in hers. His goofy, lopsided grin appeared immediately on his face.</p><p>"Have a safe trip," he said as his goodbye to Sean and Petunia, who thanked them both again, James a bit more than Hermione due to his impressive fireworks display, and then they were gone.</p><p>James glanced at Hermione. "You're quiet. Missing Petunia already?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "She wants me to explain to Sean about… us."</p><p>"Us?"</p><p>"I mean, me and Lily. Hogwarts," clarified Hermione, glancing at James. "About what we really are."</p><p>James whistled, low. He seemed to be thinking, but then said, "He'll be fine with it, I think."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"I've mentioned a few… odd… things to him when we speak," the teen admitted, ignoring Hermione's frown. "It didn't seem to bother him much."</p><p>"Well, we'll see," finished Hermione with a sigh. "Anyway, when is your dad coming to Side-Along you back home?"</p><p>James shook his head. "Password-activated portkey. So, when your parents decide to leave, I'll sneak off."</p><p>Hermione glanced around the slowly diminishing yard, taking note of the people who left when Petunia and Sean did and saw her mother helping Sean's with some clean up while their grandmother admonished them, telling them to leave it for tomorrow.</p><p>"Best go now, I think," said Hermione. "While there are still enough people here to distract others. It looks like mum is starting to clean up, so this reception is winding down now."</p><p>"Alright," agreed James easily. He leaned forward, brushing his lips against Hermione's. Her breath caught and hitched, and as he slipped his arms around her waist to deepen the kiss, she found her arms sliding over his shoulders and twine behind and then brush into his hair.</p><p>James murmured something appreciative against her lips.</p><p>"Ugh, <em>really?</em>" a voice interrupted them. The two drew back, but James kept his arms around Hermione.</p><p>Lily had a hand over her eyes. She split her fingers, testing to see if they had stopped kissing, and sighed, dropping the hand. "Mum wants to head home – says her feet are killing her."</p><p>"I'll be right there," replied Hermione.</p><p>"Don't be too long." Lily glanced at James, pursing her lips but nodded. "Potter."</p><p>"Goodbye, Evans," he replied, and the couple watched Lily walk away, back toward Rose and Leonard. He sighed. "And I think that just about killed it."</p><p>Hermione laughed.</p><p>He looked at her fondly, a smile pulling at his mouth. "I'll owl you."</p><p>"Goodnight, James."</p><p>He untangled himself and meandered around the crowd, looking for a quiet, dark corner, and found one. Hermione kept her eyes on him, watching as he turned to face her again. He lifted his hand, gave her a jaunty flick, and then disappeared.</p><p>"Hermione? Hermione, love, we're leaving!" called her mother, and Hermione turned to join her family. Once she was with them, Rose further said, "I'm coming back tomorrow with Lily to help Margaret with the cleanup. Will you be joining us?"</p><p>Hermione agreed, and the following day, returned to the Bowes property to clean up the leftover decorations and cutlery from the reception, getting to know Petunia's new mother-in-law and Sean's cousins who drove up from Surrey for the wedding.</p><p>The week went by quickly, and Hermione found herself accepting a tea from a very tanned, very relaxed Petunia in her flat soon enough. She had one more free day before returning to work, and Sean was spending his last day on their couch, indulgent as Petunia spoke about all they had seen during their honeymoon.</p><p>Finally, she came to an end and nervously reached to play with her wedding rings. Sean caught the movement and frowned. "Is everything okay, Tuney?"</p><p>She bit her lip and glanced at Hermione, who sighed and put down her teacup. "Sean, I – I have something to tell you—"</p><p>The way his face paled made Petunia stop.</p><p>"Bloody hell, you can't be pregnant already," he blurted.</p><p>Hermione erupted into laughter and Petunia scowled. "No – I am not pregnant—"</p><p>Confused, Sean opened his mouth, but Hermione decided to nip things to avoid miscommunication or Petunia's temper from getting the best of her. "Lily and I have a secret that we couldn't share with you until you married into the family, Sean."</p><p>The young man turned his confusion toward Hermione while Petunia huffed next to him. "Oh. Okay. What…?"</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. "So, this will sound insane, but it's absolutely true. Lily and I are witches, and we attend a magical school in Scotland. We were told when we were eleven. It's a genetic quirk that some people have while others do not." She tipped her head toward Petunia.</p><p>Sean blinked, sitting back against the couch cushions as he absorbed the information Hermione presented to him.</p><p>When the silence continued, Petunia glanced nervously at Hermione before turning to her husband. She put a hand on his knee. "Sean? Are you… is this…?"</p><p>Sean shook his head, a tiny laugh emerging from him. "Oh my God, Hermione, <em>so much</em> makes sense about your friend Barty now."</p><p>Petunia exhaled in relief and Hermione cracked a grin. "Yeah, he's a wizard."</p><p>"You said his dad – is high-ranking in the ministry…?" Sean began to lean forward, a gleam of something in his eyes.</p><p>"His dad is Head Auror – head of police," explained Hermione.</p><p>"And James – the fireworks, those were magical?" the man continued. He shook his head. "Blimey, all those times – he was telling me, without telling me… he mentioned owls and his favourite broomstick…"</p><p>Hermione groaned.</p><p>But then Sean was glancing between the two, something curious and wondering on his face as he requested, "Please. Tell me everything. This is – <em>amazing</em>. I want to know about it all."</p><p>Petunia beamed, reaching over. She took his hand in hers and he beamed back, and Hermione began.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>July 1978</strong>
</p><p>Hermione, Barty, and Regulus stared at the diadem, mesmerized by the sheen and sparkle of the diamonds and encrusted jewels on the piece as it reflected and bounced the midafternoon summer light from the large bay window in the reception room of Black's Haberdashery.</p><p>Despite the warmth of the July sun, the heat that suffused the room, there was a hint of iciness, of frost as their breaths escaped their mouths.</p><p>Barty was the first to break the silence, still looking at the beautiful piece. "Please tell me you haven't been sleeping here with this thing."</p><p>Regulus scoffed. "Do I look like my brother? I'm not that stupid."</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. "Do you have the basilisk venom, Barty?"</p><p>He tore his eyes from Ravenclaw's diadem, shuddering. "Yeah. Yeah." He reached into his pocket and withdrew a tiny vial. "It was a pain to get. Sorry for taking so long. Finding the right person from Father's contacts wasn't as easy as I thought it would be."</p><p>"It's fine," replied Hermione, taking the vial. She ignored how her hand trembled. The glass was thick and the venom inside was a milky colour, thin in viscosity, and had a strange yellowish tinge to it.</p><p>"What do we have to do?" asked Regulus, hushed.</p><p>"Just pour a few drops onto the diadem," answered Hermione, just as quietly. She swallowed thickly and deliberately turned her back on the artifact. "The venom will eat at the diadem and then melt part of it down. It'll destroy the Horcrux inside it, too."</p><p>"But it destroys the diadem!" protested Barty. He frowned. "Shouldn't we find a way to <em>avoid</em> that? This is a priceless piece of history!"</p><p>"Well, what do <em>you</em> think we should do, Crouch?" snapped Regulus. "Keep it and hope the Dark Lord doesn't find it later to resurrect himself?"</p><p>"It just seems terrible to destroy such a thing!" retorted Barty.</p><p>"I don't hear you coming up with anything else," sneered Regulus. He crossed his arms. "Aren't you Ravenclaws supposed to be <em>smart</em>?"</p><p>"Clearly you don't really want to destroy it," began Barty, his voice cold and hard in a way neither of the other two had ever heard before. "I bet you <em>want</em> the Dark Lord to succeed!"</p><p>"If he rids the world of blood traitors like you—"</p><p>Hermione stepped between the two snarling teens. "Whoa, whoa! Enough! This isn't you."</p><p>"It sure feels like it!" snapped Regulus.</p><p>"Reg, that's the Horcrux," admonished Hermione gently, pushing him back. She turned to Barty, who had a slightly feral look to his eyes. "You too, Barty. Take a step back. Now."</p><p>Perhaps it was only because listening to Hermione was so ingrained in their very being that both did so. The further they got from the Horcrux, the better they began to feel, and soon, both were breathing easier.</p><p>Horrified, Barty whispered, "What as that?"</p><p>"The Horcrux," replied Hermione, grimly. "It fights back."</p><p>"Is that what you felt in the cave?" asked Regulus, hands at his side as he clenched and unclenched them. He was pale and there was a high splotch of colour on his cheeks.</p><p>Hermione turned her eyes toward Regulus. "No. No, this – this is just a taste of what the Horcrux can do. It'll get much, much worse before we manage to destroy it."</p><p>"Worse?" Barty was shaking, a bit, and had his arms tight around his chest, hugging himself. "That already was terrible. I felt… I was just so <em>angry</em>."</p><p>"Take that anger, and then everything negative you ever thought about yourself or heard people say about you," said Hermione, her mouth turned down. "Every insecurity you have, every failure, every missed opportunity. The Horcrux <em>knows</em> it. It uses passive legilimency and then uses your reactions to build. Like a boggart but without a spell to get rid of it."</p><p>The two paused for a moment. Then, Regulus ventured, "What – what did you see–?"</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. "C'mon, wands up at the ready. I'll dump the venom on it, but you two need to be aware of what's happening."</p><p>Warily, Regulus withdrew his wand. Barty already had his out, but both remained several feet away. Hermione stepped forward between them, toward the table. The Horcrux seemed to leech the sunlight from around it as she got closer, leaving parts of the frame heavily shadowed.</p><p>Swallowing, Hermione thought, <em>here we go</em>, her hand shaking the slightest amount as she uncorked the basilisk venom vial. And just like that – a shade emerged, a wispy, dark figure that formed into the top half of a young man, only a few years older than themselves.</p><p>He was handsome, with very human features despite the red tint to his eyes. Regulus inhaled sharply from behind Hermione.</p><p>"Merlin," he breathed, as the shade fixated its eyes on Regulus.</p><p>"Regulus Black," it purred. "The second. The second son, the second choice. Even amongst your friends, you are second fiddle to Crouch. You will always be someone's second choice, never the first. You'll never have the same kind of attention that Sirius receives because you're just <em>too good</em>."</p><p>The shade sneered and Regulus trembled, his mouth open. "The heir and the spare, Regulus. When are you going to ensure <em>you're</em> the first? I can help you with that, Regulus – I will always put you first, give you the attention you want—"</p><p>"What are you waiting for, Hermione?!" shouted Barty, as though there was a roaring wind that they all had to speak over. "Destroy it!"</p><p>The shade's eyes turned to Barty, causing Regulus to gasp and suck in air. He had been holding his breath the entire time, and fell to his knees, gasping. His gray eyes were wide, and he had a hand pressed against his chest.</p><p>"<em>Junior</em>," the shade's teeth gleamed as it grinned at the Ravenclaw. "The boy who so desperately wants daddy's love and attention and who won't ever receive it. You'll never be good enough for him, Barty. Nothing you do – he thinks you are a failure. You could get the perfect grades, be the perfect son, and it still won't be enough. It won't take him away from the Ministry to look at you. He doesn't like you. He doesn't care about you."</p><p>"Lies!" shouted Barty, eyes a bit shiny. "Hermione, kill it!"</p><p>The shade's eyes turned to Hermione, who froze. There was something dark in the upturn of the shade's mouth as it began, "Ah, yes, the girl out of time—"</p><p>But Hermione tipped the vial and four drops sizzled out, hitting the diadem before the piece of Tom Riddle could say anything else. It wailed, loudly, and Barty reached up to cover his ears with his hands.</p><p>Then, silence.</p><p>"Is it dead?" Regulus was the first to speak. He was slowly getting up off the floor.</p><p>The diadem on the table was a melted, twisted mess of cracked jewels and warped frame. Smoke was still wafting from it, and there was a sharp scent of ozone mixed with rotten leaves in the air.</p><p>"It's dead," confirmed Hermione.</p><p>"That's two," whispered Barty.</p><p>"Fuck." Regulus dry heaved, bending at the waist. "That was horrible."</p><p>"That was nothing compared to the cave," revealed Hermione. "It only spoke to you. I had visions, all trying to stop me from continuing. We weren't even trying to destroy it. And when I say they fight back, sometimes you need to use magic, too."</p><p>"Fuck," repeated Regulus.</p><p>Barty, pale-faced, muttered, "How many of these do you think he has?"</p><p>Hermione sighed, feeling very, very tired. "Too many."</p><p>Barty all but collapsed on the couch, still staring at the melted Horcrux. Finally, he looked at his two best friends. "Are we going to do the locket, now?"</p><p>Regulus stared at him incredulously.</p><p>"Best get it over with," agreed Hermione, quietly. She held out the vial. "Who wants the honours?"</p><p>Barty stood. "Me. I'll do it."</p><p>Hermione silently passed the vial to Barty, still uncorked. He clenched it with both hands wrapped around the tiny glass, his knuckles white from the grip and tension.</p><p>Regulus, sensing he was outnumbered, sighed. He turned and withdrew the locket from the handkerchief they had wrapped it in, moving slowly toward the same table with the melted diadem. Without touching it, he carefully put the locket down, flipping the edge of the kerchief to reveal the piece.</p><p>Like the diadem, the locket sucked the light and warmth from the room, immediately. There was a hint of hissing, indistinct whispers in the air that made the three warily look around.</p><p>"What's going on?" whispered Barty.</p><p>"They're talking to each other," answered Hermione.</p><p>"But we destroyed the diadem!" Regulus' voice was shrill in panic.</p><p>"Things linger." Hermione shrugged. "Best hurry – the longer they have time to talk, even if it is only a tiny sliver, it'll be hard enough to fight back."</p><p>Gulping, Barty strode toward the locket, just as light emerged from the under the cracks of the lid, snapping the locket open. A teen their age appeared, looking around the room. His eyes lit on Barty, who had frozen. He opened his mouth—</p><p>"<em>Stupefy</em>!"</p><p>Hermione blinked in surprise at Regulus' attack. It startled the shade as well, and Barty took the opportunity to launch himself forward, hip hitting the edge of the table and knocking the diadem to the floor.</p><p>"No – no!" the shade roared, stretching up to reach the ceiling as it loomed over them.</p><p>Barty tipped the vial and the venom dripped out, sizzling on contact with the metal of the locket. The shade screamed in pain, turning red and fuzzy around the edges as it expanded, trying to take up as much room as it could.</p><p>The air felt hot and sulfurous. Regulus cast a bubblehead charm, then one around Hermione and Barty as wind whipped at them. The shade grew long and thin, and with a final shriek, burst apart.</p><p>The three waited a long moment before Regulus flicked his wand and dispelled the charm.</p><p>"Two down," said Barty, shakily. He handed the vial back to Hermione, who corked it. There was still half a bottle left. He then fell to his bum, legs unable to hold his weight.</p><p>Regulus moved to stand at Hermione's side. He caught her eyes. "Two down," he echoed.</p><p>Hermione nodded. "Two down. We can do this."</p><p>She reached out and took Regulus' hand in hers, and then stretched the other, with the vial, toward Barty. He shakily reached for it, and wrapped his fingers around her wrist, so they were all connected.</p><p>"Together."</p><p>The two grinned back at her, and she didn't comment on how pale or shaky they were.</p><p>"Together," vowed Barty, fiercely.</p><p>"Together," agreed Regulus, eyes wild and voice firm. "<em>Together</em>."</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC…</p>

    <p>Chapter Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This chapter is Hermione-POV free! All POVs are from James, Regulus, and Barty for a change. There were supposed to be 2 Regulus scenes, but I had to cut one out for brevity's sake. James's Auror test was also supposed to be included but we're at 22 pages, so I cut it. Maybe one day it'll be a deleted scene cameo on my Tumblr or a special side AO3 story!</p><p>The discussion at the end regarding Voldemort's reign leading into full-scale guerilla terrorism includes real names/people and events that I have used for the purpose of this story that <b>were not killed by witches and wizards</b>. Obviously. The 1970s was a particularly troubling time, due to the IRA, but there were also some unsolved murders and disappearances that I've used in addition to whatever First Wizarding War Pottermore shit Rowling's retconned.</p><p>Also, I'd like to take a moment to thank <i>Umbrella Academy</i> season 2 for their music, much of which I listened to while writing this. And, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Fleuriemusic/videos" rel="nofollow">Fleurie</a>. Cinematic music is lovely.</p><p>Edited, Dec 28, 2020: removed the Prewett twins as Aurors.</p></blockquote>

  <p align="center">Yesterday is Tomorrow (Everything is Connected)</p><p align="center">EIGHTEEN</p><hr /><p>"The past doesn't want to be changed. There are times when you feel it push back."</p><p>- Al Templeton, <em>11/22/63</em>, S1 Ep1: The Rabbit Hole</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>August 1978</strong>
</p><p>If the attack on Diagon Alley two years ago had never have happened, James was sure that he would've been bouncing on his toes in excitement, just like Sirius was. But the attack happened, he was there, his parents almost died, and he watched her girlfriend – before she was his girlfriend – utterly sweep the floor with her unique spellcasting.</p><p>It was humbling, what he saw in the Room of Requirement. He still hadn't told anyone else about that evening, and his suspicions – that Hermione Evans had far more going on than what everyone knew, including him.</p><p><em>No one</em> learns magic like that without being touched by… by <em>destiny</em> or studying and practicing hard because they have <em>reasons</em>.</p><p>James just didn't know what Hermione's reasons were, and while he was put out at <em>not</em> knowing, he could be patient. People looked at him and saw pranks, and brilliance in transfiguration and his friends saw his loyalty and determination and devotion – but they sometimes missed the tenacity, the ambition, and the <em>patience</em> that a wizard needed to become an animagus, to earn those grades and perfect his spells, to creatively come up with their pranks and execute them.</p><p>As it was, in early July, he wrote his Auror entrance exam with Sirius and forty other hopefuls. Only a handful, no more than fifteen, had passed the written exam. Those that passed were now lining up, ready to begin their practical exam. They had to last three minutes against Moody to qualify for the program, and James was shaking, his palms slick with sweat.</p><p>He was standing in his best, trim tailored "work" robes that his mother gifted him the morning after his graduation from Hogwarts – Sirius wore a matching pair – and heavy-duty dragonhide boots, in a line, in front of Master Auror Alastor Moody. Moody wore an open red Auror robe with three-quarter length bell sleeves, on top of a shiny, golden waistcoat. Underneath the waistcoat was a thin, long-sleeved black turtleneck. Every piece, usually designed to be eye-catching and shiny, was either dull, or frayed, and in some places, scorched. Moody was an Auror who had seen danger and beat it.</p><p>There were at least two other Aurors with Moody, silent and scarred alike, off to the side watching the newest recruits with hard eyes. The two Aurors wore the typical uniform: dark trousers tucked into dark dragonhide boots, but their tops varied. The female of the group, with her bleach-blonde perm, wore a closed, red asymmetrical jacket with the DMLE insignia as the clasp to keep the jacket shut. The jacket was tailored and cut to her shape, but also had a Mandarin collar and finished in a short tail at the back, giving her a bit of swoosh.</p><p>Her male companion wore his uniform informally, with the same trousers, but had a tucked-in white Oxford with rolled sleeves to his elbows, showing off impressive coiling scars and patchy hairy arms. His leather wand holster buckled around his chest, mimicking a non-magical's shoulder gun holster. His hair was a flyaway tawny sheen of gold, thick and flowing like Sirius's, making James wonder if he had a Black relative.</p><p>James wanted to be just as cool, attempting to wrench his eyes from the shiny buckles to focus on Moody, who stood before them with his hands clasped behind his back, his pale blue eyes calmly but shrewdly sizing them up.</p><p>His lips curled when he reached Sirius and then passed on to James who met his stare, head-on, until Moody's lips twitched, causing the scars on his face to ripple.</p><p>"Alright, you maggots," he boomed, making the recruit next to James jump in surprise. "Let's see what you're made of. You may have passed your theory, but practical is an entirely different breed of dragon."</p><p>The casually dressed Auror smirked, crossing his arms.</p><p>James felt a trickle of sweat inch its way down his spine.</p><p>"See this behind me? It's known as the Pit," began Moody, jerking a thumb over his shoulder.</p><p>The recruits leaned forward or around him, some on their toes. The room they were in, overlooked a deep, sandy gladiatorial pit, with spectators stands on either long side of the pit and one viewing platform at one head. The platform butted against the department's offices, and underneath the stands were locker rooms, showers, and training rooms like the professional Quidditch stands in how they used their space.</p><p>The furthest head of the pit was a tall, roaring waterfall that crashed into a lake, with different types of trees sprouting up around the edges and sides of the pit. The terrain changes depending on each quadrant of the pit, with sand closest to the viewing platform, rocks to the right, and snow to the left, which turned into grass and forest by the waterfall. Each terrain was meant to mimic where an Auror could be sent, except for an urban area.</p><p>Sirius's eyes were glued to the pit, taking in the large space as he cataloged the different areas.</p><p>Moody's grin was terrifying. "In five groups, three of you will enter the Pit and do your best to last as long as you can against myself, or Auror Scrimgeour or Auror Blythe."</p><p>Sirius made an audible gulp.</p><p>"Now, let's see – where to begin…" Moody began walking the line, barking out names in threes: "Henderson, Angel, McPhail; Boot, McKinnon, and Spencer-Moon." He paused in front of Sirius and James.</p><p>"Oh, yes… you two." His tone was entirely derisive, almost sneering. "I've heard much about the Gryffindor dream-team. Best split you up."</p><p>"What?!" gasped Sirius, nearly stepping out of line. "What, <em>no</em> – James and I do our best work together—"</p><p>"And one of the first things you learn as an Auror is to work with others!" barked Moody, glaring at Sirius, making him step back. "Black, you're with Gamp and Shacklebolt. Potter? I'm putting you with Covington and Hough."</p><p>Moody finished with the last set of three, and each group gravitated toward their new partners, with Sirius sulking, hands shoved into his robe pockets and hunched shoulders. James nodded politely to Covington and Hough, not like he knew which was which: just that one looked vaguely sick, with a green tinge to their face, and the other was practically vibrating in excitement.</p><p>To avoid spectators and the future combatants from seeing the testing process, a shimmering barrier burst upward from the edge of the Pit platform, racing toward the ceiling to create an entirely enclosed battleground.</p><p>"You'll be called in your groups to the Pit," continued Moody gruffly. "You'll enter through the ramp—" he pointed at the gaping, dark holes on either side of the entrance they came through via the department office "—and following it down to the Pit. Once there, we'll tell you which area you're stationed in."</p><p>"But not who is testing us?" asked either Henderson, Angel, or McPhail from the first group. Whoever they were, they were nervous.</p><p>Moody's grizzled face turned further down into a frown. "No. When you're an Auror, you won't know who that dark wizard is that you're facing. You're going in blind. Just like this test."</p><p>And like that, Scrimgeour, and Blythe moved down into the gaping tunnel. Moody pointed his wand at the barrier, where the names of the groups appeared, in order of testing. James was ahead of Sirius, but they were near the end.</p><p>With Moody gone and being unable to watch the test, James felt his nerves skyrocket. Covington – or Hough, who knew – was beside him, muttering spells under his breath, trying to remember which would work best in what environment.</p><p>All too soon, the names began to swirl and disappear from the board: Henderson, Angel, Boot, Spencer-Moon, McPhail, and McKinnon (Marlene, who both Sirius and James knew from Gryffindor and as Lily's friend), all completed their tests with those remaining having no knowledge if they succeeded or not.</p><p>James, Covington, and Hough were next; Sirius, Gamp, and Shacklebolt would be the last team in to go.</p><p>"Good luck, Prongs," muttered Sirius as James passed him.</p><p>James gave him a shaky smile in return and followed the other two down a dark, smooth tunnel that branched off in a 180-degree turn. The air cooled further, and it seemed a bit damp, the smooth stone turning rough.</p><p>They emerged into bright, artificial sunlight, and James blinked back against it.</p><p>Moody, Scrimgeour, and Blythe were waiting for them at the entrance. Moody looked the same, although there was a slightly crazed look to his blue eyes. Both Scrimgeour and Blythe had a few cuts and Blythe had a nasty bruise along the side of her jaw, meaning someone before them got a few good licks into them.</p><p>"Covington, you're with Blythe," instructed Moody. "Off to the meadow. Potter – with Scrimgeour, at the waterfall. Hough? You're with me. Right here."</p><p>He finished with a nasty grin, and finally, James figured out who Hough and Covington were when the beefy blond next to him dramatically paled.</p><p>Covington and James glanced at one another – a silent <em>good luck</em> – and moved toward their assigned instructors. Once near Scrimgeour, the man reached out and Side-Apparated James toward the waterfall, where he regained his balance upon arrival with a shaky breath.</p><p>"What happens next?" James asked, pushing his glasses up and then keeping them on his face with a sticking charm.</p><p>"Moody will wait until everyone seems in position and then you will hear a chime, announcing the countdown from three minutes," explained Scrimgeour in a Welsh accent. He was serious now, no trace of humour on his face. "Your goal is to avoid being knocked unconscious by me. You can evade, fight back, or yield as alternative options."</p><p>"If I yield?" asked James, although he already knew he wouldn't do that.</p><p>Scrimgeour's eyes narrowed. "You fail the test and phase out of being an Auror."</p><p>James gulped, just a blare rang through the Pit, accompanied by a voice: "TEN… NINE… EIGHT…"</p><p>Taking those last precious seconds to survey the landscape, James planted his feet firmly in the sandy bank of the waterfall, tightening his grip on his wand despite his sweaty palms. He gulped and met Scrimgeour's eyes as the final seconds rang down.</p><p>"FOUR… THREE… TWO…"</p><p>As the final count fell, James immediately slashed his wand to counter the spell Scrimgeour silently sent toward him. After that, James was lost to instinct and sheer luck, hoping he'd come out of this test in one piece.</p><hr /><p>James nearly collapsed onto the squishy bench in the underground ready room. There were a few others scattered throughout, some on the benches like he was, and a few on the floor, just gasping for air.</p><p>His shoulder still burned from Scrimgeour's congratulatory clap, and James was torn between grinning in exhilaration at what he accomplished during the test or just collapsing into a puddle.</p><p>McKinnon, spotting him, sidled up. "Hey. You survived?"</p><p>"Barely," groaned James, deciding that slouching was perfectly acceptable. He glanced around the room. Not all the fifteen, minus the three who were currently being tested, were in the room. What should have been twelve was only eight, meaning four had not passed. "Who's missing?"</p><p>McKinnon shrugged. "I was with Martin Boot and Flavia Spencer-Moon. Martin's not here, but Flavia is."</p><p>"So, he didn't make it," murmured James slowly.</p><p>"Probably," agreed McKinnon.</p><p>Henderson, Angel, and McPhail all passed in their set; McKinnon and Spencer-Moon in their set; all three from the set Moody assigned after Sirius, who McKinnon introduced as Killjoy, Hornet, and Dawlish. Behind James, Covington limped into the ready room, making them ten.</p><p>Nervously, James waited for Sirius's set, hoping to see his friend. Finally, two figures entered the room, arms over each other's shoulders as they helped one another into the room. The one with the curly black hair looked up, and James expelled a loud breath.</p><p>"Hey, Prongsie. Were you waiting long?" grinned Sirius, although he was very out of breath.</p><p>Behind Sirius and his set mate, Moody, Scrimgeour, and Blythe entered the ready room. Immediately, those in the room tensed and James scrambled to his feet, biting back his moans of soreness and pain.</p><p>Moody's eyes surveyed the very dirty, bruised, and tired candidates. His grin was terrifying when he barked, "Congratulations. You are now Auror trainees."</p><p>There were half-hearted cheers throughout the room, but most were too tired than to give a weak, "huzzah," which made Scrimgeour grin and exchange an amused look with Blythe.</p><p>"The easy part is over," began Moody, sternly, causing everyone to turn back to him. "The hard part begins now. Due to the rising unrest, we've streamlined Auror training from three years to nine months. It's going to be a bitch, wizards and witches. You're going to want to quit. And if you do, you'd best do it soon because I don't have time for whiny snot-nosed brats!"</p><p>A few in the room shuffled back and forth nervously.</p><p>"For those of you who tough it out: you're signing up for danger. I won't sugarcoat things for you. It's bad out there. And it's going to get worse. You're representing the front line, those who are standing against the darkness and those bastards who want to incite terror," continued Moody. "But as long as you follow this one, simple instruction… you will survive."</p><p>James and Sirius exchanged a look, and James turned back to Moody. The man swelled as he took a breath.</p><p>"CONSTANT VIGILANCE!"</p><p>James jumped as the words thundered around the ready room, and he cringed. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that someone had fallen off the bench. Someone shrieked.</p><p>Moody rolled his eyes. "Right. Blythe'll explain the rest to you now. I'll see you maggots the day after tomorrow, bright and early."</p><p>He stomped out of the ready room, leaving Scrimgeour and Blythe, who began floating a parchment with their individual schedules on them for training, including when they would report to work in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and what their training would comprise of before they move onto the next step of being paired with a senior Auror for field training.</p><p>The last thing was assigning their lockers and their Auror uniform. James reverently touched his, the two different types: one was the battle wear that Scrimgeour had on, and the other was the dress uniform that Blythe wore. The name <em>Potter </em>was stitched on the inside the collar of the two red robes.</p><p>He inhaled sharply, blinking. It was <em>real</em>. It happened. He was officially an Auror (in training, but James wasn't picky). Pride bubbled from deep in his chest and warmly spread throughout his entire body.</p><p>Then the real work began, and the week passed quickly, following their rest day. James was still physically sore from the Pit battle with Scrimgeour, and mentally sore from his classes in History in the Dark Arts, Best-Laid Pans, Resilience Training, and Concealment and Disguise. Some he could do easily – like Plans, and Concealment with his experience in pranking and transfiguration skills – but others? Like History and Resilience?</p><p>James could barely keep his eyes open, trudging through the corridors toward the lifts. He just wanted to go home, take a shower, and then a long, long nap. Who knew Auror training would be this crazy?</p><p>"Ah, young Mr. Potter."</p><p>James's hazel eyes slowly dragged up, along the vibrant lime green robes of only one wizard bold enough to wear them. He eventually met Albus Dumbledore's clear blue eyes.</p><p>"Long day?" the elderly wizard continued.</p><p>James sighed. "More like a long week."</p><p>The Headmaster of Hogwarts hummed in agreement and together they walked – slowly – toward the lift. James drew enough inner strength forward and asked, "Am I keeping you from something, Professor?"</p><p>"Oh," said Dumbledore, a smile on his lips, barely hidden by his beard and mustache, "Not at all. In fact, it's quite fortuitous that I was able to see you today, Mr. Potter – ah, James, if I may?"</p><p>James nodded. "What can I do for you, sir?"</p><p>Dumbledore had his hands clasped behind his back and looked like he was going for a stroll around the Black Lake when they both entered the lift. The doors shut before any memos could fly in and join them.</p><p>As they rose, Dumbledore asked, "How are the Aurors doing in regard to dealing with Voldemort's followers?"</p><p>James jerked, like electricity ran up his spine. "Sir?"</p><p>Dumbledore's face was like granite, cool and assessing in a way that James only saw once – the night of the Shrieking Shack incident. "I know that the Aurors are having trouble collecting these so-called Death Eaters of Voldemort's, James. They are swamped with clues and attacks, worn thin and spread far and wide. It's why your training is so intense. You need help."</p><p>Confused, James frowned and asked, "Are you planning on joining the Aurors, sir?"</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. "No, James. I think my old bones couldn't keep up with you young folk! No."</p><p>He trailed off and flicked his hand. The lift stopped between floors and James inhaled sharply, swallowing as he palmed his wand in the folds of his Auror robes. "Sir?"</p><p>Dumbledore turned to James. "While the Ministry is doing what it can to halt Voldemort's progress, they cannot do it alone. Not with <em>his</em> people already infiltrating. I am leading a group of people – powerful witches and wizards, smart and cunning witches and wizards – who will stand against the Darkness and the terror that Voldemort will bring."</p><p>James stared wide-eyed.</p><p>"I've had my eye on you for some time now, James," the professor continued, "And I think you would make an excellent addition to the Order of the Phoenix."</p><p>"The Order of the Phoenix, sir?" echoed James.</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. "The organization is not without its danger: we operate outside of the Ministry and could be considered vigilantes, ourselves. We operate in the darkness, giving light where we can for the other witches and wizards of Britain. You might die in the line of duty as an Auror, James, but should you join the Order, that risk greatly increases."</p><p>James frowned and narrowed his eyes. Hadn't he been feeling stymied as an Auror? Limited by the rules and regulations that were imposed on them by the Wizengamot? Even Moody was frustrated on the best days, and their Head Auror Bartemius Crouch, Senior, spent most of his time scowling at anyone who looked his way.</p><p>Dumbledore twitched his lips in a minute smile. "Think about it, James. Speak to your parents."</p><p>James's head shot up. "<em>My parents</em>?!"</p><p>"They are aware of the Order," confirmed Dumbledore. "While not members themselves, they help in other ways."</p><p>"I – I will then, sir," muttered James.</p><p>Dumbledore twitched his fingers again and the lift began to move. Both were silent until they reached the atrium. There was a gaggle of unhappy witches and wizards who were waiting for the lift, pushing their way in as both Dumbledore and James exited.</p><p>"Have a good evening, Mr. Potter," said Dumbledore as he moved to the Apparation point, tipping an imaginary hat as he spun on his heel and disappeared.</p><p>"Goodbye," muttered James, moving toward the point after him, thoughts full. His hand clenched on his wand and he put shoved his other into the free pocket, only to brush up against something that felt like parchment.</p><p>He froze.</p><p>"Oi, hurry up!" an irate voice shouted at him.</p><p>"Sorry, sorry," muttered James, spinning as he Apparate out of the Ministry and toward home, appearing outside the gates with a loud pop. He refused to enter, bringing in something he had no knowledge of until he reviewed what was in his pocket.</p><p>Fishing it out, he blinked in surprise at the slip of stiff parchment, with gold edging and red ink. His name was not on the page; instead, all it said was: <em>Should you wish to join the Order of the Phoenix, tap your wand to the symbol below. A portkey will be supplied to those who are brave of heart, clear of conviction, and devoted to ending tyranny.</em></p><p>James furrowed his brow, staring at the glittery phoenix below the text, its wings spread wide in midflight. The invite sat on his desk for a few days, and at night, James often spent a few sleepless hours staring at it, shadows haunting his face.</p><p>Eventually, on his first free weekend, James stood in casual robes and, with a hesitant glance to his shut door, tapped his wand on the phoenix symbol. Immediately, the invite curled as flames licked at the parchment.</p><p>James yelped and backed up a few steps, mouth agape as the flames burnt the paper but nothing else until ash remained. Then, the ash faded like dust to reveal a tiny medallion with a phoenix etched onto its face.</p><p>Griping his wand with one hand, he reached out and touched the medallion with the other. Immediately, he was whisked away, swearing loudly as the world whirled by him until he landed hard on his arse on damp, dewy grass outside of a small, stone cottage.</p><p>Slowly, James sat up, eyes sweeping the ground just as his Auror training had him do, when there was a loud shriek and then a heavy thump as a moaning, wriggling body in nice dress robes landed near him.</p><p>James peered and nearly laughed but settled for a smirk. "Nice landing, Pads."</p><p>"Fuck off James," the face-planting form of Sirius Black groaned.</p><p>"Are you two wankers going to make like mushrooms, or are you going to come inside where it's nice and warm?"</p><p>Both James and Sirius glanced up to see Remus, standing backlit at the entrance of the cottage. He had his arms crossed and a grin on his tired face.</p><p>"Moony!" James cried, getting to his feet, and hugging his friend. "Where are we? How've you been?"</p><p>"I'm good," answered Remus, stepping back from his friend. "And you're at the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix."</p><p>James's mouth dropped open, eyes growing wide as he peered back to look at the unimpressive cottage. Remus snorted and yanked James into the building, which was expanded inside to a comfortable size with multiple armchairs and couches and ottomans scattered around the room with people of varying ages and robe colours dotted in those seats.</p><p>Dumbledore stood before them all, near the fireplace. "Welcome, Mr. Potter, Mr. Black. I'm glad you could join us."</p><p>Gulping James slowly eased into the room and toward a couch that Remus pushed him at, with Sirius nearly on his heels as they sat. Remus sat next to them on a chair he had clearly conjured, as it was a design he favoured, and beside him, Peter waved.</p><p>There were other familiar faces: Lily's shining auburn hair, glinting off the flames from the fireplace, with Marlene McKinnon at her side; James recognized his boss, Alastor Moody, as well as his friend, Edgar Bones, a judicial representative for the DMLE. Professor McGonagall was sitting stiffly in her transfigured chair, speaking to Hagrid.</p><p>Frank Longbottom and his wife caught his eye and Frank nodded at him, as a fellow Auror. There were two other well-known wizards from the Ministry at the table, the Prewett twins Gideon and Fabian, who both coolly nodded at him.</p><p><em>Who else is involved, and who else has he tried to recruit?</em> thought James, hiding his deepening frown as his eyes roved the room, finishing on Sirius who looked as uncomfortable as he did, especially when Moody signalled them out.</p><p>"Well, if it isn't our dynamic duo," the Master Auror drawled. "Finally ready to join the big boys in the fight?"</p><p>"Alastor," chided Dumbledore, his blue eyes falling on his friend, who scowled. "We are here to welcome two new members: Sirius Black and James Potter. If anyone has any reason as to why they should not be inducted, please speak now."</p><p>Immediately, someone James didn't know piped up. "Can we trust a <em>Black</em>?"</p><p>James vowed to remember that person's face, burning it to his memory when Sirius flinched beside him.</p><p>"Mr. Black has my support," said Dumbledore plainly. "I trust him. He is not like his family."</p><p>"Are we planning on inviting Regulus Black next year, then?" asked a woman with wiry hair and thin-framed glasses. She had a pinched expression on her face.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled pleasantly at her. "I certainly do plan on extending invites to young Mr. Regulus Black once he graduates, as well as his two friends, Emmeline. Perhaps you know them, Mr. Crouch, junior, and Hermione Evans?"</p><p>Hermione <em>was being considered?</em> thought James, with a dopey grin appearing on his face as he daydreamed the two of them fighting side-by-side against Death Eaters, her using her incredible, strange magic and him, transfiguring the objects around them to attack and defend.</p><p>Sirius nudged his side, and James was pulled from his daydream.</p><p>"—inviting Orion and Walburga next?" continued Emmeline, a haughty drawl to her voice as she pulled on her lace shawl, drawing it tighter across her shoulders. "Perhaps Cygnus and then we should open the Order to Andromeda and Narcissa since they're not Death Eaters!"</p><p>There were a few heavy scowls in the room at the suggestion, and Sirius still looked rattled at his family being singled out, but Dumbledore was firm.</p><p>"Regulus Black is a candidate, and furthermore, is not the topic of debate for tonight," broke in Edgar, in the serious voice he used at the Wizengamot. "Albus as approved Sirius and James by vouching for them and that's good enough for me. We have other issues to concern ourselves with."</p><p>Dumbledore sighed. "Very true, Edgar."</p><p>All eyes turned to the Headmaster.</p><p>"You might notice one of our number is missing," the wizard began gravely. "Caradoc was sent on a scouting mission a few days ago and failed to report in after it to Alastor. Alastor of course alerted me and we checked all our safe houses in the meantime."</p><p>"They haven't been touched," added Moody gruffly. "Dearborn's not checked in."</p><p>"Then he's been taken," said Alice gravely, clutching Frank's hand. "Is he… do you think… he's still alive?"</p><p>"I went to his last known position," said Moody. "There was sign of a struggle or fight. Heavy scorch marks and a few burned down buildings, as well as the remnants of three different blasting curses—"</p><p>"Are you talking about the Mayfair explosion?" blurted Sirius, making everyone turn to him. "It's – it was on the Muggle news—"</p><p>"Yes," sighed Dumbledore, looking very tired and weary as he closed his eyes. "Voldemort has been attacking Muggles and causing massive, wide-scale problems from the Ministry. As you know, being an Auror, Mr. Black—"</p><p>"In <em>training</em>," hissed Moody from behind Dumbledore.</p><p>"—with Voldemort's followers doing untold damage to both worlds," finished Dumbledore, ignoring Moody's interruption. "Aurors are run ragged, there's not enough to police the streets or apprehend these witches and wizards while protecting the Statute of Secrecy. I fear Voldemort will drag our world into the light, in one bloody massacre after another."</p><p>Horror filled the room, and Dumbledore turned to Sirius and James.</p><p>"This is where you come in," he began, his voice quiet and firm. "We need witches and wizards, good wizards like yourselves, to help. To ease the burden of the Aurors and Ministry workers who are doing their best and falling short. To help stop Voldemort's tyranny."</p><p>Sirius and James shared a glance, and James caught Remus's hopeful eyes just past Sirius, as well as Peter's earnest look. They had already signed up, and James understood why. He hated Dark magic, he hated what Voldemort stood for, and even the thought of those followers of his – his Death Eaters – and the idea that they could attack Diagon Alley as they had… that they could terrorize innocent people in both worlds, and that there wasn't a Hermione there to stop them…</p><p>Well. James was a Gryffindor. And when things got rough, Gryffindors stepped up.</p><p>He would step up.</p><p>Resolved, James took a deep breath and looked Dumbledore straight in the eye. "What do you need from me, sir?"</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>October 1978</strong>
</p><p>Wilkes was staring at him.</p><p>Barty could feel it as he buttoned up his shirt, keeping his eyes on his hands and not on the shallow-faced blond on the bed next to his, trying to look inconspicuous as he laced his boots up with a spell.</p><p><em>Take a picture, it will last longer,</em> thought Barty with the tiniest sneer, eyes barely flickering at his fellow Ravenclaw.</p><p>He knew he was good-looking – not just because his mother told him so, but he'd seen the reactions that the other Ravenclaw and Slytherin girls made when his eyes would sweep over the tables. None ever approached him, though, most unwilling to get past Hermione to speak to him.</p><p><em>Not like you'd let them,</em> a tiny voice piped up, reminding him that he was aloof enough to not care for his classmates, anyway. He had no time for anyone who wasn't Hermione or Regulus, and he quite liked it that way. He was barely accepting of Potter's place in Hermione's life, and he'd been aware that the Gryffindor was interested in her since that hair ruffle way back when.</p><p>With an inaudible sigh, Barty turned to leave the dorm room.</p><p>"Hey, Crouch!" shouted Wilkes, behind him. "Wait up!"</p><p>Barty's hands twitched and – if he actually had hackles – they would've raised and been accompanied by a threatening growl. As it was, Barty did not wait and continued his walk from the dorm and down the stairs of the Ravenclaw tower toward the common room. By the time he reached it, Wilkes was huffing behind him, with a ruddy complexion.</p><p>"Oi, I said <em>wait</em>," the other Ravenclaw whined.</p><p>"Why?" asked Barty, simply. He barely spared a glance, determined to stride through the common room to the exit. From the corner of his eyes, he saw Anthony Travers, Wilkes's friend, rise from his seat and make his way toward them.</p><p>There was a loud grumble behind him.</p><p>"Crouch, <em>c'mon</em>," whined one of them, even as Barty continued through the exit and down the hallway corridors to the Great Hall for breakfast. "We just want to talk to you!"</p><p>"I don't see why," Barty tossed over his shoulder. "We've never spoken before."</p><p>"Yeah, that's because you're always around Black or your pet mudblood—<em>ack.</em>"</p><p>Barty whipped around, ignoring his wand entirely. Instead, he braced his forearm against Wilkes' neck, pressing into his windpipe and slowly choking him. Barring his teeth in the mimicry of a pleasant grin, Barty asked, "Sorry – what did you say? I must have misheard you."</p><p>Wilkes's green eyes were wide as he wheezed, "Friend! <em>Your – friend – Evans!</em>"</p><p>Barty held Wilkes there for a long moment, glancing to the side at Travers who was staring, open-mouthed. But there was a glint in his eyes, one that screamed amusement and awe, relishing in how Barty was acting. Noticing it, Barty immediately let go of Wilkes, who coughed and gasped as he slid down the wall, staring up at the other Ravenclaw. Barty took a few steps back, avoiding temptation. He shoved his hands into his pockets.</p><p>"What Wilkes was <em>trying</em> to say," began Travers, eyes trailing up and down Barty's body in a way he didn't like, "Was that you have a small friend circle. We'd like to be friends."</p><p>Barty considered it for all of one second. "No."</p><p>"What about study partners, then? You have extremely high grades, and all your spells are nonverbal," cajoled Travers, his tone still vaguely pleasant as he smiled at Barty. There was something off to him, though, that Barty didn't like at all.</p><p>"Hermione taught me."</p><p>It didn't deter Travers. "Well, would she be interested in tutoring us? I'd love to learn. It sounds like we have much in common."</p><p>Barty's brows furrowed. "What are you getting at, Travers? You and Wilkes are pals, and Wilkes here uses language like that… and you expect me to think that you'd be able to take instruction from <em>Hermione</em> easily?"</p><p>Wilkes went to speak, but Travers held a hand to stop him, causing the other teen to stare at him in surprise. "Well, I don't know Evans well, but I'm sure it would be instructional. I'm always looking for people who are remarkably talented."</p><p><em>That</em>, thought Barty, zeroing in on that last bit. "Talented?"</p><p>"Yes, you know – nonverbal magic, sometimes wandless spells," explained Travers, as though mentioning the sky was blue. "Evans is quite talented, isn't she? I've seen her do wandless magic, sometimes. And she must have taught you and Black because you both use the same flourishes that she does."</p><p>Barty frowned, mentally swearing. He thought they had been careful, that <em>Hermione</em> of all people would've been more careful! If they saw this, figured that out about her, what else would they learn? Regulus was already sniffing out more and more inconsistencies regarding Hermione, despite Barty always jumping in to change the subject. He knew he couldn't keep that up forever and Regulus would soon catch on to him.</p><p><em>This is a disaster,</em> he mentally groaned, his face twitching. He absently, nervously, licked at his lips. "So?"</p><p>"Well, that kind of magical ability is impressive," continued Travers, a bland smile on his face. "I'm not the only one to think so."</p><p>Barty narrowed his eyes. "She's Muggleborn."</p><p>"And you're a Pureblood, as is Black," pointed out Travers evenly. He shrugged. "So what? Her older sister in Gryffindor was a magical powerhouse, too. Clearly, there is something in the Evans blood. Their mother or father is probably a squib."</p><p>"That matters?" asked Barty with a tiny scowl.</p><p>"To some, it might," replied Travers. "To some, it might make all the difference."</p><p>He wanted to roll his eyes at the blatant implication Travers was making. Obviously, if Barty wasn't already deeply involved in fighting against the Dark Lord, he probably wouldn't have caught on Travers and Wilkes's veiled hints of where their allegiance lay. Barty wanted to scoff – they thought the <em>Dark Lord</em> had power? Was going to bring about change to the magical world?</p><p>Instead, he shook his head. "Fuck off. I'm not interested."</p><p>Wilkes scowled, ready to speak again, but Travers, once more, cut him off. It was easy to see who led whom. "Just think about it, Crouch. We won't need an answer yet, anyway."</p><p>"Yeah, sure." Barty rolled his eyes and turned on his heel, leaving both in the hallway, deciding against breakfast. Instead, he moved through the entrance hall and past the clocktower. Sometimes, to avoid the crush of people from the entrance hall, Hermione, Regulus, and Barty would wait for each other behind the clocktower, by a half-wall in view of the greenhouses.</p><p>Hermione was waiting, sitting on said half-wall with a book open and the flat of her shoes pressed against the stone when Barty arrived, grumbling. He flung himself next to her, and even though she didn't look up from the book, she asked, "What's bothering you, long face?"</p><p>"Wilkes and Travers," he muttered.</p><p>Hermione snapped her book shut and looked at him. "I beg your pardon?"</p><p>Frowning, Barty sat up. "They stopped me when I was leaving the dorm. Wanted to chat."</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "Did they want to invite you to their super-secret evil club?"</p><p>"Is that what we're calling the Death Eaters now?" asked Barty idly, hiding a grin by staring down at his nails. He <em>knew</em> Hermione would realize what happened!</p><p>Hermione snorted.</p><p>Barty sighed. "But yes, that was essentially it."</p><p>"And what did you say?"</p><p>Barty rolled his eyes this time and sent Hermione a scathing look. "What do you <em>think</em> I said? I told them to fuck off."</p><p>Hermione hummed.</p><p>"What?" frowned Barty.</p><p>"I doubt they'll back off," mused Hermione out loud.</p><p>Barty shrugged. "Don't care. I'm not interested."</p><p>Hermione peered up at him, and eventually said, "Alright," leaving it at that. She opened her book and began reading again, while Barty fished in his robe pockets for a snack, eventually pulling out a single chocolate frog box. He pulled it open and snatched the frog out before its first jump and was savouring a chocolate high when Regulus appeared, shoulders thrown back in confidence and looking perfectly coiffed with his thick hair slicked back with gel.</p><p>Barty scowled; his hair never looked that nice when he used Sleakeazy…</p><p>"Are we ready to go?" asked Regulus, stopping in front of them. "I want to get some shopping done before the afternoon crowd."</p><p>"Sure," agreed Hermione, closing her book and shoving it down her jacket pocket, where Barty watched as the entire thing was swallowed by the fabric. He poked at it, and she swiped absently at his hands.</p><p>"Hermione," he began, staring at her, "Did you cast an extension charm on your pockets?"</p><p>Hermione's brown eyes shifted back and forth, and she brought a hand up to rub at her collarbone. Barty frowned at the gesture, knowing it was her tell and she was about to lie. "<em>Nooo</em>…"</p><p>Gasping, he pointed at her and cried, "Liar! Liar, you always do that! You so <em>did</em> cast an extension charm on your pockets!"</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him. "I don't know what you're talking about."</p><p>"How far does it go?" he asked instead, crowding up to her and yanking at the bottom of her jacket. "Did you cast it nonverbally? Is it on both pockets?"</p><p>He gently pulled on her jacket and stuck his hand in the pocket, wriggling his fingers around and staring in awe as nothing changed on the outside. Delighted, Barty grinned and stuck his arm to his elbow in her pocket while Hermione stood still and sighed, sending a dead-eyed look at Regulus, who merely pursed his lips to hide his amusement as he turned his head away.</p><p>"Oh, bugger," he muttered, eyes widening at something he saw in the distance.</p><p>"What?" Hermione asked, and Barty pulled his arm out, focusing on Regulus.</p><p>"It's Lestrange," groaned Regulus.</p><p>Barty frowned. "I thought he graduated ages ago. You should know. He's married to your cousin."</p><p>"No, not <em>Rodolphus</em>," sneered Regulus with a heavy sigh, "The smaller one. The younger Lestrange. Rabastan."</p><p>Barty and Hermione peered in the distance at what Regulus was looking at, spotting the fifth year as he caught sight of them and began a purposeful stride directly toward them from the clock tower.</p><p>"What's so bad about the kid?" asked Hermione, confused, as she looked between Lestrange and Regulus.</p><p>"He keeps <em>following</em> me," whined Regulus, and Barty and Hermione immediately burst into laughter at the tone their other friend made. "It's not funny! You know he's doing this to spy on me for the Dark Lord! I don't want him around! He's so aggravating!"</p><p>"So, tell the little gremlin to piss off," suggested Barty with a shrug.</p><p>"You think I haven't?" groaned Regulus.</p><p>The three fell silent just as Rabastan appeared, smiling nicely at Regulus as he came to stop near them.</p><p>"Hello, Black," the younger Slytherin greeted. His smile was frostier when he glanced at Barty and Hermione, and immediately, Barty felt his back stiffen.</p><p>"Lestrange," muttered Regulus.</p><p>"Are you off to Hogsmeade?" continued the fifteen-year-old, oozing smarm. "I can accompany you if you'd like. Then you don't have to spend time with this…" he glanced over Barty and Hermione and sneered, "<em>Riffraff</em>."</p><p>"Careful, gremlin," muttered Barty, eyes fixated on the teen. "We're seventh years and I <em>bite</em>."</p><p>Hermione bit off a snort of laughter. Rabastan's pale eyes landed on her and his sneer grew more pronounced. It looked ridiculous on the teen's face, who had clearly not shed all his baby fat, leaving his cheeks a bit rounder than his much older brother's lean face.</p><p>"No one asked for the opinions of a blood traitor or a mudblood," he spat.</p><p>Regulus lost all sense of pureblood composure and buried his face in his hands.</p><p>"What did you say?" growled Barty, sliding off the wall to stand, looming over the much shorter teenager.</p><p>Rabastan rallied well, gulping but then squared his body as he jutted his chin out. He put on his loftiest Pureblood voice when he said, "You heard me, Crouch. You're a blood traitor that associates with mudbloods."</p><p>"Thought that was what he said," said a cheerful Hermione as she slid off the wall to stand next to Barty. She was looking at Rabastan with a strange look on her face, one that Barty couldn't read. "Wanna say that again?"</p><p>Rabastan couldn't read Hermione any better than Barty could, and Regulus was still pretending this wasn't happening, by imitating an ostrich. Barty let his eyes rove between Hermione's cheerful face and smile, but there was something glinting in her eyes.</p><p>"<em>Mudblood</em>," spat Rabastan, one last time.</p><p>"Thanks," said Hermione, who went to turn away from Rabastan and toward Barty. But Barty saw her hand twitch and his mouth split into a wide grin as he realized what was about to happen. Hermione spun on her heel and swung her closed fist into Rabastan's nose.</p><p>The Slytherin shrieked, hands immediately coming up and cupping his nose as blood trickled through the gaps.</p><p>"<em>You hib be</em>!" he cried, voice muffled from his hands and nose. "<em>By ngose! You broke by ngose!</em>"</p><p>"Huh." Hermione leaned forward, peering intently at Rabastan, who froze with her mere inches away. "Look at that. It's red."</p><p>"<em>Whad</em>?" Rabastan muttered, eyes watering and glaring at her.</p><p>"Your blood. It's red. Just the same as mine." Coolly, Hermione straightened, peering down at the younger teen who was also a few inches shorter than her. Whatever she saw, it wasn't what she wanted, so she sighed and began walking away, down the path to the carriages.</p><p>Regulus paused, looking at Rabastan. The younger Slytherin peered up at him, a few tears swimming in his eyes. But then he shook his head, dismissing the younger teen with a sigh and a worn, "Don't worry, it'll heal."</p><p>Barty turned on his heel to walk backward, he snickered at Rabastan, "Unlike your dignity."</p><p>Rabastan stood there, two splotches of colour on his cheeks, and his eyes fixated firmly on their retreating forms. Barty shook his head and turned his back on him, jogging a few steps to catch up with Hermione and Regulus.</p><p>He tossed an arm over Hermione's shoulder and tugged her to his side. "After Reggie's shopping, we're stopping at the Broomstick, right?"</p><p>"Yes," agreed Hermione.</p><p>"Is your <em>boyfriend</em> meeting you there?" asked Regulus, his eyes teasing.</p><p>"Regulus, my love," began Hermione with a glint in her brown eyes even as her curly hair crackled, "I've already punched one Slytherin in the face today. I can make it two if you'd like."</p><p>"Spoilsport," muttered Regulus sourly.</p><p>Barty laughed, tossing his head back. Wilkes and Travers could offer him the whole world, but he had everything he wanted right there, and that would never change.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>Halloween</strong>
</p><p>James quickly realized that <em>this</em> fight was nothing like Diagon Alley. He also quickly realized that, at fifteen, Hermione had been able to hold her own against Death Eaters – two of who were likely here, fighting against <em>him</em> – with ease, compared to the majority of the Order members who rushed to aid Edgar Bones.</p><p>There was something a bit strange about that fact – but James had to push it from his mind to focus entirely on the swarth of Death Eaters in inky black robes that blended into the shadows from the nearby grove of trees, the rapid spellfire sent his way, and the burning house behind him. He did his best to ignore what smelled like bacon, knowing that the Bones' did not keep farm animals on their land and knowing exactly what was cooking.</p><p>Fighting to gag, James dodged a sickly yellow spell, ending in a crouch with a lunge toward the patchy fence that surrounded the house.</p><p>A part blew inward, bits of wood scratching at his cheek and his arm. Deep gouges spread out from the fence in the earth and James tripped onto his rear as he loudly swore. The Death Eaters weren't playing around.</p><p>Leaning back, James popped his head up over the fence – just tipping his nose up at the right angle to glance over it. There were three Death Eaters facing him, in a line, just by the treeline of the nearby grove. He ducked when a spell was sent his way by one of them.</p><p>"<em>Shite shite shite</em>," he muttered, turning to kneel and then crawl his way along the fence, keeping as low as he could. When he was finally a few meters from his original spot, he took a deep breath and then launched up, hauling himself over the fence, slinging a wide-ranging <em>reducto</em> at the trio.</p><p>"Bollocks!" one shouted, throwing themselves to the side to avoid the spell.</p><p>The two others were directly hit, one yowling in pain as the spell clipped their leg, pulverizing it. The other managed a <em>protego</em>, the spell bouncing harmlessly off the shield.</p><p>"It's James Potter!" the one who moved away shouted over the cries of the downed Death Eater. They made a sharp motion with their wand, and something bright green hurled its way toward James.</p><p>Eyes wide, he spotted a clay flowerpot nearby. "<em>Accio</em> pot! <em>Depulso</em>!"</p><p>The flowerpot met the killing curse and shattered. But James wasn't idle, rushing forward at the same time, following the pot and trusting his aim and magic. He sent a second banishing charm at the shards immediately following the breakage, sending them at the wizard who initial cast the spell.</p><p>"The fuck!" he shouted, barely managing to redirect the shards away. They slammed into the grass, jagged bits of brown sticking up like an uneven mountain range. "You utter wanker, Potter!"</p><p><em>Clearly this is someone who I pranked at Hogwarts,</em> thought James with a mental eye roll, given the rather juvenile insults and swears, as well as awareness of him. <em>If that's the case…</em></p><p>James summoned the shards again, and while they flew toward him midair, he transfigured them into clay grasshoppers. An <em>engorgio</em> grew them into a horrifying size, and <em>oppugno</em> sent them as a vicious swarm around that Death Eater.</p><p>He began shrieking, casting blasting curses at them.</p><p>James waited until there was an opening and then cast <em>stupefy</em>; the red spell sailed through the air, between two grasshoppers, and hit the Death Eater, sending them crumpling to the ground like a marionette whose strings were cut.</p><p>He then turned to the other Death Eater, the one who cast the shield, and who had been watching him carefully. "I won't be as easily distracted."</p><p>"We'll see," muttered James.</p><p>The two stood for a long moment, ignoring the shouts and splashes of colour around them as other members of the Order of the Phoenix and Voldemort's Death Eaters fought. Somewhere amidst all the chaos, James could hear cruel, high-pitched laughter.</p><p>In a flurry, James shot a spell at the same time as the Death Eater. Then he ducked while casting <em>protego maxima</em>, watching as his enemy's spell soared over him.</p><p>The Death Eater dodged James's spell by sidestepping it, and taunting, "Missed me!"</p><p>James fought back a grin. "Did I?"</p><p>Unable to tell the Death Eater's facial expressions behind the mask, he could only beam in appreciation as his spell splashed into the tree behind the Death Eater. The tree's bark rippled and warped as the transfiguration took hold, its roots pulling up through the ground as they displaced dirt and clumps of grass. The limbs began to weave and rock, leaves cascading down around the Death Eater, cluing him in to something going on behind him.</p><p>He turned slowly, freezing as the tree pulled itself free, and crawled toward him while its long, thick branches swept forward. The Death Eater nimbly leaped over the first few branches that scored the ground, dragging bits of grass with them.</p><p>Then, the branches split into long Vs and further split, lancing forward with deadly, sharp points. There were cries of alarm from the Death Eater, who did his best to avoid the winding, twisting vine-like branches even as they anticipated his moves, bending and twisting in angles that were unnatural.</p><p>James's transfiguration was top-notch and this, he thought, was one of his best.</p><p>Without warning, the limbs pierced the Death Eater's thigh, pushing through fabric, flesh, and muscle, and dug into the ground to hold the man in place. Two other limbs knocked the man to the ground: one through his shoulder, and another through his wand hand. He was immobilized.</p><p>James bit back a grin, sending his wand toward the ground with a sharp move that broke the branches from the tree, leaving the Death Eater speared in place; the tree lumbered back to its original spot and settled back into the hole it made. Then, James ended the spell with a loud exhale.</p><p>"Impressive, Mr. Potter."</p><p>James's blood turned to ice at the cool, high-pitched voice behind him. Slowly, he turned, first with his head and then the rest of his body following as he saw, in person for the first time, the Dark Lord Voldemort.</p><p>He stood tall, taller than most men James knew, in black robes. Unlike his followers, he didn't wear a skull-like mask to hide his identity, and for the most part, he looked like a regular man with slicked-back black hair. He was paler than normal, his skin not seeing sunlight, and had a shallow face, but his eyes – James shuddered. They were blood red.</p><p>But still – it didn't do to show your enemy fear, James knew. So, he stood straight, swallowed down the lump in his throat, and threw his shoulders back even as his grip on his wand clenched.</p><p>"Is 'Voldemort' your first or last name? I'd like to know how to address you," taunted James. "After all, it's only polite."</p><p>Voldemort's thin lips curled into a parody of a smile. "You may address me as the Dark Lord, Mr. Potter; but I would prefer <em>my lord</em>, from you. I have been wanting to meet you for some time now."</p><p>James gagged at the thought of calling <em>anyone</em> "my lord." Instead, he narrowed his eyes and didn't speak. Voldemort continued to survey him, ignoring the carnage behind. Several Order members were fighting Death Eaters, and the odds were fairly even in who was winning – Moody and the Prewitt twins were viciously taking out whomever they could but the Death Eaters they were fighting were just as intent to kill.</p><p>Behind all of that, and Voldemort, the Bones house was a raging bonfire, flames licking at the stars and smoke obscuring the rest as it thickened and billowed above them. The backlight it provided for the Dark Lord made James gulp – it was a powerful image.</p><p>Voldemort tilted his head. "I see you are following <em>Dumbledore's</em> little resistance group." He tsked. "He was always the fool, unable to recognize power and utilize it properly. Are you merely one of his foot soldiers? You could be more with me: a general, a leader. I would give you the opportunity to stretch your imagination. I saw what you did with that tree. Imagine what else you could do."</p><p>"I can do that perfectly well working with the Order of the Phoenix," replied James through bloodless lips.</p><p>Although he had no eyebrows, Voldemort's expression was one of surprise. "Order of the <em>Phoenix</em>? Is that what the fool calls his group? How… quaint. And… rather disheartening."</p><p>Furious, James spat, "How so."</p><p>The look Voldemort sent him was that of disappointment. "A phoenix bursts into flames and then is reborn from its ashes, only to grow and begin the cycle again, Mr. Potter. While it is a symbol of rebirth and fire, it is hardly something you'd want to name your vigilante group after. Unless, of course, Dumbledore believes that even if I manage to kill or turn his members, there will always be some form of resistance."</p><p>"You can't kill an idea!" shouted James. "People will<em> always</em> fight against the Dark!"</p><p>Voldemort sighed. "How pedestrian." From his robes, he withdrew his wand, a long white stick that looked like bone. "Well, shall we?"</p><p>There were no flourishes or tells when Voldemort began: he just pointed his wand, held loosely between his thumb and middle finger, and the killing curse shot from its tip.</p><p>James swore as he brandished his own wand, conjuring a bronze shield, more like an enlarged knut, to block the spell. But that was only Voldemort's opening salvo: flashes of colour, mostly killing curse green, mustard yellow, bright purple and sizzling red, flowed from his wand, cast all nonverbally so James had no idea what they were unless he knew the spell.</p><p>And some, he did – thanks to his mother's Black heritage.</p><p>The purple spell? Organ crusher.</p><p>The sizzling red? Blood-boiler.</p><p>But then there were dazzling orange swirls in fiery rings, and something black and oily they crept along the ground toward him, and James soon found himself sweating through his robes, his hair damp and flat against his forehead and neck and desperately losing ground as he was forced back into the trees.</p><p>He attempted to animate a nearby tree, but Voldemort sent a <em>bombarda</em> at it, and the tree exploded with a loud, resounding crack, sending large, sharp bits of wood in all directions. James barely had time to throw up a <em>protego</em> for the wood to harmlessly bounce off of before he was forced to drop it and swing around a nearby tree trunk for protection.</p><p>"<em>Fuck</em>!"</p><p>"I was expecting more, Mr. Potter," chided Voldemort as he calmly stalked forward into the grove. "Is this all? Perhaps my spies were mistaken about you…"</p><p>James knew it was stupid to be drawn into the Dark Lord's taunts, but he felt his annoyance flare. He was panting, his hand slick with sweat and he was tired. His side was battered and bruises, and there was a sticky, dried patch of blood on his side from where some wood shards got him before his spell went up.</p><p>Voldemort was barely winded, and no one had come to help him. So, the dark wizard wanted a show? James would give it to him.</p><p>He conjured the memory of Hermione from Diagon Alley in his mind, and then the training exercise he had spied on in the Room of Requirement with Crouch. He spent a moment thinking of the way she moved, how she manipulated her magic, and felt his breathing even and his body calm. He knew what he was going to do.</p><p>"Come now, Mr. Potter!" called Voldemort, not moving forward any further. "Face me!"</p><p>"Gladly, you piece of shit," muttered James.</p><p>He spun on his heel and slashed his wand at the earth in front of him. He dashed out from behind the tree, following the rolling wave the earth made as it built up into a wave, rushing headlong toward Voldemort, who looked pleased and amused.</p><p>The wave obscured James every so often, and Voldemort blasted it apart, splitting the wave in two to provide a clear shot – but James was no longer there. Voldemort paused.</p><p>James instead cast on the earth, using the wave as a distraction: pillars of solid rock jutted up, providing stepping-stones for him to launch himself forward, high above the Dark Lord.</p><p>Voldemort's head tilted as he caught sight of the young wizard, lazily sending <em>reducto</em> at each pillar, but James was already nimbly jumping for the next, the spell anticipating his moves and bursting from the ground at speeds that were too fast for the Dark Lord to anticipate – until he swept his wand in a wide arc and a bright, fuzzy white spell washed across the grounds, obliterating anything in its way, including the pillars.</p><p>James swore as the pillar crumbled underneath him, but he was still several meters above Voldemort and used that to angle his body at the wizard. He pulled his knees to his chest and quickly cast a spell on his glasses, and then pointed his wand at Voldemort.</p><p>Voldemort brought his own wand up to cast a shield, but James surprised him, shouting: <em>"Solis maxima!"</em></p><p>Blinding light burst from James's wand, illuminating the area around the two wizards and calling attention to him. The light was so bright even with a shade spell on his glasses, James had to close his eyes and he still teared up behind his eyelids.</p><p>He hit the ground, his ankle crunching under him. He cried out and rolled over his shoulder, coming up in a crouch on his good foot, wand extended in front of him and blinking past sunspots that his spectacle turned sunglasses didn't stop. The spell faded from his glasses, leaving them normal.</p><p>Voldemort stood before him, startled enough that he too, froze momentarily, and James took the opportunity to shout, "<em>Expelliarmus</em>!"</p><p>The spell barely grazed the Dark Lord as he twitched enough to the side, deftly avoiding the magic that crackled by him.</p><p>"Mr. Potter," began Voldemort, sounding amused, "Well played. We'll cross wands again, I'm sure."</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>Voldemort threw his wand up and cried, "Morsemorde!" A long, green smoky haze burst from the wand tip and hung lazily and low in the sky, the smoke turning bright green and forming the shape of a skull with a snake coming from its mouth.</p><p>James's mouth dropped open at the sight of it and snapped his eyes back at the wizard, but Voldemort smiled coolly at him and Apparated away.</p><p>"NO!"</p><p>James lurched forward, hobbling on his leg as he moved to where Voldemort previously stood, only to trip and fall to the ground. He slammed his fists in anger.</p><p>No! He got away! James gritted his teeth and tried to push himself up but slipped on the upturned earth from his previous spells. A hand caught his arm and he turned his head, snarling—</p><p>"Easy, boy," muttered Moody, who was bleeding from a deep gash that cut through one eye, swollen closed. "It's over Potter. Stand down."</p><p>Breathing heavily, James let Moody haul him up, and he put his weight on his good ankle. "What happened… sir?"</p><p>Moody sent him a look. "Saw the end of your fight with the bastard. You did good, Potter."</p><p>"Thank you, sir, but – what happened? Are Edgar and his family safe?" asked James, glancing at the burning house.</p><p>Moody's face, when he turned back to look at him, was weary. "The bastards sealed the house and warded it before we got here. There was no way out for them."</p><p>Horror stole James's breath. "No – no one got out?"</p><p>"They were dead before we got here, no matter what we'd have done to help," muttered Moody savagely.</p><p>James felt his knees buckle.</p><p>"Easy now, Potter… Keep your head on…"</p><p>"It was all for nothing?" he asked, voice small, as he looked at his Auror instructor.</p><p>Moody sighed. "Sometimes, you can do everything right and it still won't save people, Potter… James."</p><p>James stared at Moody for a moment, hanging off his arm. Then, he turned and vomited into the grass at their side. He felt, more than heard, Moody sigh.</p><p>"It's alright, Potter," he heard the man speak, although it was distant and from behind the thud of his blood in his ears. "It's just the adrenaline from the fight. Your first kill. You fought the Dark Lord and <em>survived</em>, Potter! That's more than most can say. You did good."</p><p>James barely heard the compliments, eyes trained on the still burning building before them, with the knowledge that Voldemort and his Death Eaters had succeeded in their goal: murdering Edgar Bones and his family.</p><p>Moody hauled him forward, toward where the other Order survivors either stood or were guarding Death Eaters they took prisoner, already barking out orders to Fabian and Gideon – both bloodied but wearing matching feral, pleased grins – to Frank Longbottom and his stern face.</p><p>Sirius was sitting on the ground, head in his hands, robes cut up and torn in places; Peter was hissing as someone applied basic first aid to a large burn on his shin.</p><p>James's hazel eyes surveyed the landscape, finally resting on the Bones house. <em>I'm sorry</em>, he thought, sending it toward Edgar, his wife, and children, who were no doubt terrified in their last moments. Maybe it was quick – James hoped it was.</p><p><em>But if Voldemort thought this would demoralize us – would stop us</em>, thought James furiously, <em>he thought</em> wrong.</p><p>"Each loss is a lesson learned," whispered James to himself, blinking back tears, face warm from the heat of the flames. "And with each loss, we will rise from the ashes."</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>November 1978</strong>
</p><p>The attack on the Bones family was all people could talk about. They kept their words careful, quiet, but talk – they did.</p><p>The Bones were the prominent family: Edgar Bones had worked for and directly with Alastor Moody in the judicial branch of the MLE, a long-time friend, and partner of his. Moody was rumoured to be on a warpath, according to the Prophet, tearing through Knockturn Alley as he looked for the people who were responsible for his friend's murder, Death Eaters who had escaped that night.</p><p>Worse, Edgar Bones' wife and young children – four of them, all under ten – were murdered alongside him in the safety of his ward-constructed home. While there were no images of the family in the special post-Halloween issue, other than the Dark Mark floating above the house and a few canids of Edgar and his wife at a Ministry function, the description of the bodies was graphic.</p><p>On the same night, Edgar's parents were murdered in their family home, and only Amelia – an Auror who lived away from her parents' home – and her younger brother Julian – who had been out with friends – survived.</p><p>Regulus was the last to arrive in the classroom Hermione had appropriated so long ago, having had to shake Rabastan Lestrange from his heels, citing "personal time" with his girlfriend – the wonderful Calypso Fawcett who happily worked as Regulus's decoy, a long-standing arrangement they had worked out back in their fifth year after that terrible party of Diggory's.</p><p>Both Hermione and Barty were already there, joined at the hip as always. Regulus had learned long ago to push away the jealousy he felt at their closeness, knowing that his sorting into Slytherin certainly hadn't helped him much. The political climate made things more difficult with Hermione's muggleborn status and Regulus had to fight tooth-and-nail and creatively come up with reasons to continue to associate with her.</p><p>Hermione was pacing, arms tightly crossed against her chest, while Barty lounged on some of the desks they had pushed against the wall. He had a tiny cloth bag in one hand and was snaking on some Halloween candy leftover from the previous night.</p><p>As Regulus stepped into the room, shutting the door behind him, Hermione's head snapped up along with her wand – not to curse, but to ward.</p><p>Regulus added his own privacy spells to the ward sequence she was creating, based on familiarity.</p><p>Once done, Barty said, "Well. That happened."</p><p>Regulus frowned at the cavalier tone. "It was a senseless murder."</p><p>"It was calculated murder," countered Hermione, her mouth a thin line. Her arms were still tightly folded against her when she turned to them. "Bones and Moody were a great team. How many people had they brought in the last two years, suspected of working for the Dark Lord?"</p><p>"At least twenty," answered Barty, his cheeks hollowing as he sucked on something particularly sour. His eyes teared and then he cleared his throat, shaking his head. "Father's been keeping track. He loved those two."</p><p>"Going after someone in their own home, that's… bold," added Regulus. "Wards aren't easy to dismantle. Not good ones, anyway."</p><p>The three were silent. Finally, Barty muttered, "I guess 'mysteriously disappearing witches and wizards' won't be headlines anymore."</p><p>Regulus swallowed. "There were more people the last time…" He cleared his throat. "His recruiting is going well."</p><p>"Aurors aren't," said Barty with a sniff. "Father was complaining that most are failing the written portion and barely any make an effort or have the wand skills for duelling in the practical."</p><p>"That's because we've had a different defense professor every year," sighed Hermione, finally moving to sink into a battered chair. "Clever."</p><p>"Clever?" echoed Regulus, moving a bit further into the room.</p><p>Her hair was a fluffy, curly curtain that blocked her face for a moment before she pushed the hair back. Hermione then nodded; her eyes downcast. "Isn't it convenient? A Dark Lord – less and less capable Aurors – a slowly reduced budget – people who disagree with his politics disappearing. They're all connected."</p><p>Regulus stared. It wasn't the first time Hermione had made leaps and bounds with her logic that he couldn't follow, but a quick glance at Barty had the Ravenclaw wizard look away quickly, adopting a bored expression. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>"Are you saying that… <em>he</em>… planned this?" Regulus trailed off, waving a hand around the room to indicate Hogwarts.</p><p>Hermione nodded, again.</p><p>"Over a <em>decade </em>ago?" continued Regulus, incredulously.</p><p>Hermione sighed, tilting her head back. She then pressed the heels of her palms to her eyes and muttered, through gritted teeth, "Yes, Reg. He planned this. He's clearly meticulous and has long-term goals. Think about who has disappeared since this all began."</p><p>Obediently, Barty began listing a few names. "The Bones', recently. Nobby Leach. He went on a 'long, overdue vacation' after his tenure as Minister."</p><p>"I thought the party line was he was sick? Not dragon pox, but something else." Regulus looked between the two, then closed his eyes. "He wasn't sick, was he."</p><p>"No."</p><p>Regulus couldn't bear the look of pity in Hermione's brown eyes. Instead, he looked away. "This was '68. A decade ago."</p><p>"And since then, there have been numerous <em>gas leaks</em> in London and other muggle towns," continued Hermione quietly. "The Irish politician, John Barnhill."</p><p>"Father said that was the IRA…?" trailed off Barty.</p><p>Hermione shot him a glance. "With an explosion that destroyed his <em>house</em>?"</p><p>Regulus swallowed thickly, and Hermione continued speaking.</p><p>"There was that headless female body, found in Norfolk in '74. Tavish MacRae – the Quidditch player for Portee? He went missing, and so did his wife and son, just two years ago. And –"</p><p>"That's enough, Hermione!" The words ripped from Regulus's mouth just as his stomach churned. "I – I get it. <em>He's</em> been planning this for ages."</p><p>"Longer than we certainly have been thinking of getting rid of him," agreed Hermione quietly. She got out of her chair and stood near Regulus, hesitantly reaching out and brushing his shoulder with her fingers.</p><p>He sent her a weak smile. All was forgiven – when could he stay mad at her? The knowledge of the Dark Lord – Voldemort, as he was calling himself – had been planning this since he was at least their age was troubling. Regulus knew his parents were involved – to varying degrees – but just how far had Voldemort sunk his claws in elsewhere? In the Wizengamot, the Aurors, or the other departments?</p><p>
  <em>At Hogwarts?</em>
</p><p>"So, what chance do we have?" asked Barty, eyes fixated on Hermione.</p><p>She shrugged. "Finding his Horcruxes is the best lead we have."</p><p>"And two down isn't a bad start, either," agreed Regulus, perking up a bit, despite the sick feeling in his stomach.</p><p>Hermione grinned, although it wasn't as wide as it could be. "True! So… we just need to figure out if there are more."</p><p>"You said it was likely," pointed out Barty, also physically pointing at her with a licorice wand.</p><p>"Uncle Alphard mentioned Bellatrix has something," added Regulus. "So that's another."</p><p>"And there's Voldemort himself," said Hermione with a nod. She glanced at Regulus. "Did you notice anything out of the ordinary when you saw him last?"</p><p>"You mean other than being utterly terrified for my life?" asked Regulus dryly.</p><p>Barty snorted.</p><p>The Slytherin shook his head. "He doesn't wear any jewelry. He doesn't have any… ornaments. He just wears his black robes and lets his presence do the rest in terrifying you."</p><p>Hermione hummed thoughtfully. "Anyone close to him?"</p><p>"If she could get away with it, I'm sure Bella would be rubbing up against him like a kneazle in heat," muttered Regulus.</p><p>Barty choked on his sweet.</p><p>"Ew." Hermione wrinkled her pert nose up in disgust. "Thanks for that image, Reg."</p><p>Barty began gagging, coughing up bits of his sweets as he bent at the waist. Both Hermione and Regulus ignored him, Hermione returning to her chair as Regulus moved opposite her at another set of desks to lean against.</p><p>Hermione thoughtfully drummed her fingers along the arm of her chair. Finally, she declared, "We need more information."</p><p>Barty, red-faced, choked out, "And where are we going to find that?"</p><p>Hermione looked at him, then Regulus, and said, "We're going to need help."</p><p>Regulus frowned. "Surely you're not thinking of telling someone else all this! Who could we trust? Who would help us?"</p><p>"Do you trust me?" asked Hermione.</p><p>"Of course," answered Barty, even as Regulus nodded, slowly. He was mentally running names, dismissing them as quickly as they appeared:</p><ul>
<li>
<em>Potter</em> – too Gryffindor. His close ties to his parents and Dumbledore were obvious and Hermione clearly did not want Dumbledore's help.</li>
<li>
<em>Sirius</em> – too outspoken and wouldn't be able to keep quiet.</li>
<li>
<em>Lupin</em> – his lycanthropy was a liability as his Alpha could order him to speak the truth.</li>
<li>
<em>Pettigrew</em> – laughable to even think.</li>
<li>
<em>Evans</em> – not close enough with Hermione to be worth consideration, and too emotional to trust.</li>
</ul><p>"Who?" asked Barty, frowning.</p><p>There was a glint of something that was half grim determination, and half wild madness that Regulus had, over the years, come to recognize as a hare-brained scheme of Hermione's in the making. He sighed. "Who are you thinking of, Hermione?"</p><p>She grinned. "Leave that to me. I have the perfect person in mind."</p><hr /><p>TBC…</p>

  <strong>December 1978</strong>
</p><p>Even though Petunia was going to see her for Christmas at their parents' back in Cokeworth in a few days, somehow, the eldest Evans was unsurprised to see her youngest sister standing out of her door, hands shoved deep into the pockets of her winter coat and a bright, Gryffindor red scarf wrapped around her neck and covering the bottom half of her face.</p><p>She sighed, stepping back, and leaving space for Hermione to enter. "Come on in, then. It's just us – Sean's finishing up some overtime at the clinic and won't be back for a bit."</p><p>"Thanks," replied Hermione, sighing in pleasure as she stepped into warmth. It was quite a bit colder this December than previous ones, and she had to walk from where the Knight Bus had dropped her off, several streets away, to get to the estate.</p><p>Petunia had set up a tiny Christmas tree on an end table tucked in the corner of the living room, nestled between a bookshelf and a chair. There was a TV in the corner, and a squishy couch with a coffee table made up the rest of the living space. To make things festive, she had strung up fairy lights and had replaced a few boring landscape prints with stockings.</p><p>"Tea?" called her sister from the kitchen.</p><p>"Please," called back Hermione, unwinding her scarf as she gratefully sank onto the couch.</p><p>Petunia returned momentarily, carrying a teapot, two cups, and small bowls of sugar, cream, and honey on their mother's serving tray, which she had gifted Petunia as a housewarming present last year.</p><p>"I would ask why you're here, three days before we're going to see each other," began Petunia, peering at Hermione with her wide blue eyes, "But I have a feeling you're going to tell me anyway, and that it's going to be something very important."</p><p>"It is," replied Hermione quietly, focusing her eyes on her cup as she made it to her preference. She swallowed. "What… what do you know about the magical world?"</p><p>Petunia's eyebrows shot up. "That's a bit of a loaded question, Hermione. And very vague. What are you fishing for?"</p><p>Hermione scowled. "Stop being such an investigative journalist."</p><p>"It's my job—"</p><p>"You're a glorified secretary at a PI's firm—"</p><p>"It's still my dream, you toerag—"</p><p>"<em>So sorry, Tuney</em>—"</p><p>Both sisters stopped, glowering at each other with matching scowls before glancing away and hiding their smiles. Finally, Hermione sighed and traced a finger against the raised edge of the serving tray's design to keep her hand busy. "I don't think you're going to like what I'm about to tell you."</p><p>Petunia's brow furrowed, but she obediently sat back, her teacup delicately held between two hands and four fingers, the very image of a poised housewife.</p><p>Rubbing her collarbone, Hermione slumped. "Officially, everything is fine with the magical world. Unofficially… we're in a civil war."</p><p>Petunia's teacup wavered in her hands and tea sloshed over the side as she fumbled but did not drop it.</p><p>"It's not… it hasn't been <em>too</em> bad, but… people are going missing. Certain people who are outspoken about their politics and beliefs," continued Hermione quietly. "Mostly about pro-Muggleborn, squib, and creature rights. Anyone who speaks against Dark magic and Pureblood families."</p><p>"You and Lily are considered Muggleborn," whispered Petunia, eyes wide and through bloodless lips as her face rapidly paled.</p><p>Hermione nodded.</p><p>"Do you remember that funeral I attended last summer? For Alphard Black?" asked Hermione.</p><p>Petunia nodded, slowly setting her teacup down.</p><p>"He was… he was… helping me." Hermione had to stop to swallow her tea in a quick gulp, trying to remove the lump that settled in her throat. "Helping me, Barty, and Regulus. We… we found out some things about the… the leader."</p><p>"Who wants to hurt you?" gapped Petunia.</p><p>"Well." Hermione's lips curled up. "Not just me – but yes. No one in the wizarding world is calling him by his name – because they think saying it will draw him to them. So, they're calling him 'You-Know-Who.'"</p><p>Petunia scoffed at that.</p><p>"Yeah," grinned Hermione, "I know. But, anyway – I know his birth name. But I don't know much else about him."</p><p>Petunia's eyes narrowed and she leaned forward, closer to Hermione. "Why do you need to know about him, Hermione? Why <em>you</em>?"</p><p>Hermione glanced away, out the window that overlooked the flat entrance. "I came across something of his, I think. And it's… evil." Hermione wrapped her arms around her chest and shivered as cold settled over her, just thinking about the Horcruxes Voldemort had already made, and the locket and diadem they had already destroyed. "And then I found another."</p><p>"He made two of these things?" Petunia brought a hand to her mouth and then reached out to touch Hermione's hands, clenched as they were on her thighs. She was ice cold.</p><p>Hermione's eyes were a bit lost when she looked at her sister. "I think he made <em>more</em>. And I don't know where or what they could be until you stumble upon them."</p><p>"But why you?" cried Petunia, scooting forward and grasping Hermione's cold hands with both of hers. "Why not bring it to the attention of your police – to James, even? Or even your headmaster?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "James said they're overrun but keeping things quiet. More and more people are going missing and some case files are conveniently going missed or being closed abruptly, too."</p><p>Petunia's hands jerked. "Dear God."</p><p>Hermione nodded, slowly. "Yeah. This Dark Lord has his people in the police force. And as for Albus Dumbledore…" Hermione trailed off and sighed, bringing one of her hands out from under Petunia's to run it through her windswept hair, deftly avoiding it being caught. "I think he's running his own resistance group, but given how many people are disappearing, I don't think he's doing so well."</p><p>Petunia pursed her lips. "And you think that an eighteen-year-old witch who hasn't even graduated secondary school can do better?"</p><p>Quietly, Hermione began: "'When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle'."</p><p>Petunia sighed. "Of course, you would quote the original letter rather than the paraphrased quote." She blinked rapidly. "<em>Oh, Hermione.</em>"</p><p>After a few moments, Petunia rallied herself, sniffing a bit. "What do you need?"</p><p>"I need information on the Dark Lord," said Hermione quietly. "Do you think you could help me, Tuney? Your job is perfect for this, but… I don't want you to get hurt, either."</p><p>Petunia stiffened her back, sitting up straight. Affronted, she spat, "Do you honestly think I'd let you go off and do this on your own, now? I don't think so! You're an Evans, and so am I—"</p><p>"Technically, you're a Bowes, now—"</p><p>"Shut up, Hermione."</p><p>The two sisters sat in silence for a moment while Hermione sat, chastised, and Petunia collected her thoughts. Finally, Petunia nodded once to herself and then stood, walking to the kitchen. Curious, Hermione twisted on the couch and peered over the back, looking across the tiny front hall to the kitchen doorway. Petunia appeared quickly, a pen and pad with her.</p><p>"Okay," the blonde began, a determined jut to her jaw. "Tell me everything you know."</p><p>Hermione grinned. "His birth name is Tom Marvolo Riddle, and he graduated Hogwarts in 1944 – so he was born in 1926."</p><p>"Name's peculiar enough that people will remember it," muttered Petunia as she scribbled. "And birth dates are good."</p><p>She looked up. "Parents? Birth location? Anything else?"</p><p>"Father was Tom Riddle, senior, from Little Hangleton. His mother was Merope Gaunt, but she was a witch, so you probably won't find anything about her," continued Hermione. "I think they'd both be from the same area, and the Riddles had money."</p><p>Petunia frowned at Hermione, glancing up. "You seem to know a lot more than you were letting on…"</p><p>"I know stupid stuff," sighed Hermione, "But knowing his parent's names isn't going to tell me what <em>he</em> is like. He did grow up in an orphanage, though."</p><p>"Helpful," sighed Petunia. "And a starting place." She put down her pen. "I'll see what I can find and then I'll get it to you in a return owl."</p><p>"Thanks, Tuney." Hermione bounced off the couch seat to hug her sister. "You're the best!"</p><p>"Yes, well," sniffed Petunia, her bony arms reaching around and hugging Hermione tightly.</p><p>That was how Sean found them when he walked in, a surprised but happy expression on his face. "Hermione! Hello! I wasn't expecting you." He hefted up a bag that he held, enticing scents wafting from it. "Up for some Indian?"</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>January 1979</strong>
</p><p>December 1978 quickly moved into January 1979, and Lily's nineteenth birthday. With a light heart, Hermione began planning with Madame Rosmerta at the Three Broomsticks for a special dinner for Lily's birthday, just as they had planned the previous year when they were both still at Hogwarts.</p><p>Hermione sent an owl to Lily a week before her birthday, asking to confirm their dinner plans and suggesting that she side-along Petunia so that the three sisters could be together; she would make sure to sneak out of Hogwarts through the Honeydukes passage and Barty already confirmed that he would cover for her if asked, and Dirk agreed to be a distraction as well if necessary.</p><p>Lily didn't reply immediately, but Hermione wasn't worried. She had a few assignments to complete for school – which were easy but kept her busy enough – while Lily was actually being an adult in the workplace. She was also living with Marlene and Mary (but not Phoebe, who had just recently gotten engaged to Pericles Belby) and, Hermione was sure, working for Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix.</p><p>Then Lily's reply came.</p><p><em>Sorry,</em> she wrote, <em>but I made plans that night with the girls. I wasn't expecting you to remember something we said last year! It was really sweet, but you're still at Hogwarts and should focus on that instead of sneaking out. Potter's clearly been an influence on you, huh? Take care – I'll see you at Easter if you're going home. If not, after graduation!</em></p><p>Something sour settled in the back of Hermione's throat as she read the owl, her hand clenching and crumpling the parchment as she did so. Barty, at her side at the Ravenclaw table, glanced at her hand, then her tight face, and immediately found the sweetest thing on the table in reach and summoned it toward them.</p><p>"Eat this! You'll feel better," he instructed, shoving the fruit tart at her.</p><p>"Sugar isn't going to make me <em>not</em> think my sister's a toe rag," muttered Hermione, but she obediently took the fruit tart and bit into it, chewing mechanically.</p><p>Barty fluttered about her helplessly. "I'm sorry!"</p><p>Hermione stewed for several more minutes in anger, running through scenarios in her head ranging from sending Lily a howler; to giving her the silent treatment again; to whining about it to Barty, Regulus, or hell, even James.</p><p>But then she sighed. <em>I'm being stupid about this, aren't I?</em> she thought, morosely looking down at the crumpled letter, Barty's anxiety a near-physical presence hanging over them.</p><p>She was expecting Lily to jump into doing anything she could to spend time with Hermione when even Hermione recognized that there was too large a gap between them to bridge with forced lunches and nostalgia. <em>Of course</em>, Lily had her own life, outside of Hermione and Hogwarts. Of course, she wasn't on the best terms with Petunia still. And of course, Lily would rather spend her birthday with her best friends, not her younger sister who was still in school.</p><p>Hermione closed her eyes and murmured, "Life is too short to be angry at one's sisters."</p><p>Barty peered at her. "Er. If you're sure…"</p><p>"I am," she replied, exhaling in a long breath. "If it's good enough for Jo March, it's good enough for me."</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"Nevermind."</p><p>Barty peered at her suspiciously but dropped the subject. Instead, he began asking about their Charms homework, and Hermione happily replied, even though a part of her was still on Lily's letter.</p><p>She had issues regarding Lily, she knew that. Petunia had been terrible, calling them 'freaks' once they got their Hogwarts letters, but her vitriol had never been aimed at Hermione. Hermione had not been the one to snoop in her room with Snape, had not been the one over the years to continue to make fun of her, or drop branches on her head. That was why it was easier for her to forgive Petunia.</p><p>Lily, though, had seen Hermione every day for six years at Hogwarts. Two of those six years was spent in near silence, after the O.W.L.s disaster, so for four years, Lily spent much of her time with her friends in Gryffindor and only ventured out to speak to Hermione sporadically – enough so that most of the Hogwarts population had no idea they were related until Hermione's fourth year.</p><p>The sense of neglect, or even completely not understand her sister when Lily, of all people, should have understood Hermione, was perhaps a driving cause of Hermione's unease and frustration. Every time she reached out to Lily, something would tear her sister's attention away or she just wouldn't <em>get</em> Hermione.</p><p>Was it Hermione's fault? For being too old in a too young body? Did she keep putting expectations of Lily <em>Potter</em> in her sister's place and then conveniently let her fail in meeting those expectations? Should Hermione be making allowances for Lily because they were on different paths, and that was okay?</p><p>Whatever it was – Hermione needed to come to terms with her relationship with Lily <em>and</em> Petunia and their roles in her life. Lily was already seven months free from Hogwarts and functioning as a full-fledged witch in a world that was ready to explode in a civil war. She had other concerns than ensuring Hermione didn't feel <em>slighted</em>.</p><p>Even if Hermione did feel that way, she paused long enough to consider: how was Lily going to see once <em>Hermione</em> graduated, and didn't join the Order of the Phoenix? How was Lily going to look at her, and what would she see, when Hermione withdrew with Barty and Regulus as they hunted the remaining Horcruxes?</p><p>What would Lily see when she looked at Hermione? A witch who would do anything to save those she cared about, in this life and her previous? Someone who would do anything to ensure she never died, even if she would have no knowledge of that previous timeline?</p><p>Or her younger sister, best friends with who Pureblooded wizards, all three courted by Voldemort and Dumbledore equally – a witch who wasn't afraid to use Dark magic, who wasn't afraid of fighting and killing?</p><p>What would Lily think then?</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>March 1979</strong>
</p><p>James wasn't expecting Barty, of all people, to meet him in the Shrieking Shack on March 24th, three days before his nineteenth birthday. He was expecting Hermione – it was what they planned, after all, since his birthday fell on a Tuesday and he had work. So, with his face twisted in confusion, James blurted, "What are <em>you</em> doing here?"</p><p>Barty, leaning against the wall with his arms and his ankles crossed, rolled his eyes. "Waiting for you."</p><p>"Where's Hermione?"</p><p>"Inside the castle. I'm here to sneak you in," replied Barty evenly, his brown eyes fixed on James as he watched the older man blink, still confused.</p><p>"But… we were… supposed to meet here?"</p><p>Both wizards took a moment to look around the dusty, mangled interior of the upstairs room in the Shrieking Shack. Dust motes floated in the early morning air that filtered through the boarded-up windows, and there were clumps of animal droppings in one corner from a squirrel, or mole, or something small. Maybe Peter.</p><p>Barty's scowled. "Yeah, really classy, Potter."</p><p>James flushed. "Okay, so it wasn't my best idea, but did you honestly think I'd get a room at the Three Broomsticks or something? That's just…" it was his turn to scowl. "Hermione's not that kind of witch."</p><p>"At least we agree on that," replied Barty, pushing off the wall. He sighed. "For some reason, Hermione seems to think you're wonderful."</p><p>"Really?" a goofy grin settled on James's face.</p><p>"Unfortunately," muttered Barty. "And since she's my best friend, that means putting up with you. And helping her spend time with you."</p><p>"Look, if this is too much of a problem, we can just have a date in Hogsmeade—"</p><p>"You'll get swarmed by Gryffindor groupies who miss you and your mates," retorted Barty with a soft snort. "Isn't that why you both wanted to meet away from the village during a Hogsmeade day?"</p><p>"Well, yes…"</p><p>"Then follow me," instructed Barty, turning on his heel toward the stairs. "A few of us went through a lot of effort for her."</p><p>Touched, James inquired, "Who? And what did you all do?"</p><p>"I'm supposed to fetch you," Barty replied, not turning to face James as he led the way James knew much better. "And sneak you into the castle. From there, Reg is taking you to Hermione, and Cresswell and a few of the other Gryffindors are creating a distraction near the dungeons to occupy the professors. That way, no one sees you."</p><p>"<em>Cresswell</em>?" James had not been expecting his once-rival to care that much about him, despite being housemates.</p><p>"Don't think it was all for you." This time, Barty did grin at James over his shoulder. "One; Hermione asked, and he'd do anything for her."</p><p>James scowled.</p><p>"And two; Rabastan Lestrange has been following Reg around for the last few months, and it's driving him batty. Cresswell and a few others decided that pranking the Slytherins in your name—"</p><p>"<em>My</em> name?" sputtered James.</p><p>"Well, the Marauder's, I guess," amended Barty with the shrug, "And also to annoy the little gremlin. Reg also promised Cresswell a letter of recommendation for the Ministry job he wants, as the Black heir, so that might have had something to do with it…"</p><p>"Huh."</p><p>There was little conversation then, Barty deftly freezing the knot on the Whomping Willow when they emerged from the underground tunnel, and James swept his invisibility cloak over his shoulders, keeping hidden and on Barty's heels as they took a leisurely stroll across the grounds.</p><p>"Can't we go any faster?" hissed James.</p><p>"Why?" asked Barty, eyes fixated forward on the castle. "Do you have somewhere to be?"</p><p><em>Sometimes I think I hate you,</em> thought James viciously but without much ire. He knew Crouch disliked him – disliked everyone who wasn't Hermione or Regulus – but he was taking perverse pleasure in his slow amble and keeping him from his girlfriend.</p><p>"A wizard is never late," continued Barty, although it was said from the corner of his mouth. "Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to."</p><p>"Are you quoting something?" asked James suspiciously. "I feel like you're quoting something. Like, something Hermione would say. Or quote."</p><p>When Barty refused to speak – as they were coming up a group of Hufflepuffs leaving the castle for Hogsmeade, James inched forward a bit more and nudged him in the back of the head.</p><p>The Ravenclaw scowled, heavily, eyes darting around for James – despite knowing he was under the cloak.</p><p>"C'mon, Crouch, is it a quote?" muttered James, on the teen's right.</p><p>Barty sent a scowl in that direction, keeping quiet as they passed the clock tower.</p><p>"<em>Crouch, </em>is it?" whined James. "This is going to bother me now."</p><p>There was a happy grin on Barty's face when he heard that, and they moved to the stairs in front of the entrance hall. James fought back a snort, a sound his animagus self would make when irritated when Barty remained silent.</p><p>They entered the castle, Barty immediately making a beeline for an alcove behind the stairs. In the shadows, James could make out a form, which as they approached, revealed itself to be Regulus, grey eyes darting back and forth in paranoia.</p><p>"We're here," announced Barty, slipping into the alcove.</p><p>Regulus looked around suspiciously, so James lowered the hood of the cloak. Regulus's eyes fastened on him, froze for a moment, and then shuddered. "That's so creepy. Alright. Up we go to the seventh floor, Potter."</p><p>"The Room?" he asked, perking up from his funk that Barty sent him into,</p><p>Regulus nodded his confirmation, looking out at the entrance hall again. "Ready?"</p><p>"Yeah." James resigned himself to asking Hermione about what Barty said, when Barty called his name quietly, making him turn. His hands remained on the hood, ready to flip it up.</p><p>"It's a quote," confirmed Barty, fighting a grin on his face.</p><p>"I knew it!" hissed James in victory, also grinning. But then it wiped off his face and he narrowed his eyes at Barty. "Wanker."</p><p>The Ravenclaw rolled his eyes and James covered himself completely. Regulus rolled his own eyes but then moved out of the alcove and James followed on <em>his</em> heels, feeling a bit weird at this game of subterfuge. Hermione and her friends must have been really bored if they were going through all this trouble for him, he thought.</p><p>He could understand if Hermione was bored – she didn't have as many N.E.W.T.s to write as Crouch or Regulus, having already written two – but surely, they were spending time studying? It would matter for their future careers!</p><p>Actually, now that he was thinking about it (and thinking so with a frown), what <em>did</em> Hermione want to do when she graduated?</p><p>James resolved to ask Hermione, but they were on the seventh floor now, and Regulus turned a corner. Hermione stood by a large painting of trolls attempting to dance in tutus, watching them. Seeing her, illuminated by the sun from the line of windows between the paintings, James felt his heart speed up. It had been too long since he saw her last.</p><p>"Hey," greeted Regulus, calling out to Hermione.</p><p>She turned, and James paused, seeing the wand in her hand.</p><p>"How did we meet?" asked Hermione, a serious look on her face.</p><p>Regulus, apparently used to the paranoid behaviour and question, wasn't phased and answered readily, "We fell in the Black Lake when crossing before the Sorting."</p><p><em>They had? </em>Thought James, wide-eyed. <em>How did I not know that?</em></p><p>Hermione's wand slowly lowered, and then she huffed, "Aren't you going to ask me something?"</p><p>Regulus sighed. "What was the name of the stuffed animal you used to sleep with until your third year—"</p><p>"Regulus!" shrieked Hermione. When he sent her an expectant look, she muttered, "Snuffles."</p><p>James dropped the cloak in shock. "You had a stuffed toy?! How did I not know this?"</p><p>Hermione sent Regulus a dirty glare in response. "Look what you did—"</p><p>"These are your protocols, Hermione, <em>Merlin</em>—"</p><p>"Wait, protocols?" asked James, head swinging between the two. "What for?"</p><p>"Stuff," replied Regulus.</p><p>Hermione nodded. "Stuff."</p><p>James narrowed his eyes, and repeated the word, slowly. "Stuff."</p><p>The two friends looked at each other, eyes searching, and then turned back to James. Regulus smirked, Hermione crossed her arms and nodded, definitively. "Stuff."</p><p>James peered at them a bit longer, and then sighed, turning his eyes to the ceiling. "I am off duty. I am here to see my girlfriend. It's my birthday soon. You know what? I don't care right now."</p><p>"Good idea," agreed Regulus, giving a lazy wave. "See you later – or, well, not. But I need to get to the dungeons and see what Cresswell cooked up." There was glee in his voice when he muttered, "Merlin, I hope he did something embarrassing to Lestrange…"</p><p>He turned and disappeared the way he came, leaving Hermione and James alone in the hallway, James still a floating head. Hermione bit back a grin and gestured at him. "You wanna stay like that?"</p><p>"What?" James looked down at him. "Oh!"</p><p>He took the cloak off and stuffed it in his pocket, a bit of shimmering material trailing out. He then turned back to her expectantly. "Now what?"</p><p>"Think of what you want the Room to be, pace back and forth three times in front of the wall. I'll stay here."</p><p>Curious, James followed Hermione's instructions, first slowly and then pacing aggressively. <em>I want a comfortable place for us to spend the day together. I want a comfortable place for us to spend the day together…</em></p><p>He thought that several more times, and then a familiar wooden door popped up against the wall. He sucked in a breath, glancing back wide-eyed at Hermione, who was grinning. She gestured for him to open the door and enter the room first. Hesitantly, James stepped forward, twisted the knob, and entered—</p><p>His bedroom. At Potter's Peak.</p><p>Everything was the same, down to the quill he had used to write up reports the night before, resting precariously on top of a pile of defense books he had pulled from the library, by his bedside table. A fire was stoked and healthily flickering in the fireplace, casting a warm orange glow on the maroon couch in front of the fireplace, and further on the matching maroon bedspread and gold pillows of his large bed.</p><p>The mirrored door of his wardrobe was closed but the other partially open, hinting at his everyday robes and Muggle wear. There was a collection of his photographs and cologne bottles on the dresser opposite the window seat overlooking the late afternoon Welsh landscape, hinting at time dilation, or at least, that James wanted something later at night as that would be more romantic than a high noon sun.</p><p>"This looks familiar," teased Hermione as she stepped in, and shut the door behind her. It sounded very loud to James – but that was probably the pounding of his heart. He had dreams about Hermione in his bedroom, ever since Yule when she came over.</p><p>"Yeah?" he croaked.</p><p>The look Hermione sent him made James feel like a sizzle of <em>something</em> raced up his spine and ended up in his head, turning everything fuzzy and golden. His mouth went dry. His eyes fixated on her as Hermione walked toward him, the tiniest sway in her hips that made him gulp.</p><p>Just as she reached him, Hermione veered to the side, huffing a laugh under her breath as he pouted. Instead, she went and sat on his bed, bouncing a bit as she tested the springiness. She patted the spot beside her on the thick maroon duvet. "Come here and sit. I need to give you your present."</p><p>Wolfishly, a grin spread across James's face as he shrugged off his outer robe, revealing his Auror-grade wand holster, white button-up Oxford, and a gold Auror vest. He playfully leered at her. "My present, huh?"</p><p>"Put a chill order on the fiendfyre, Potter," said Hermione, rolling her eyes. She reached into the pocket of her robes and withdrew a shiny golden package. "I meant a <em>physical</em> birthday present."</p><p>"Oh, I was thinking something <em>physical</em>, too—"</p><p>Hermione threw the box at him and he caught it, thanks to Quidditch and Auror reflexes. He was laughing even as he undid the wrapping, grinning down at the box, regardless of what it was because <em>Hermione</em> gave it to him.</p><p>"You know, you didn't have to get me anything," he began, putting up a token protest, but he adored the fact that she did. Then, his hands stilled, and he went quiet, staring open mouth at the contents. "Hermione…"</p><p>He withdrew the shiny dragonscale Auror jacket. When the firelight bounced off the scales, they lit up a deep, blood red. Anything not facing the fireplace was an inky black. The cut was in standard Auror trim, like the asymmetrical design of the fancier jackets, and on the inside of the Mandarin collar was his name stitched in gold.</p><p>"It's bespelled, as well," said Hermione quietly, even as James walked over and sank onto the bed next to her, still staring and holding out the jacket, open, between his hands. The box lay forgotten on the floor at their feet. "Rain-resistant, heat-resistant given it's dragonscale. You could take most spells and not even feel them when wearing this—"</p><p>"Hermione," began James, quietly, "This must have cost a fortune… how—"</p><p>Hermione's cheeks tinged pink. "I've made – um, I've made some good investments over the years – that's not the point – my Gringott's vault is healthy—"</p><p>"That's not what I meant," muttered James, glancing at her from under his fringe. He let the jacket pillow in his lap, and he ran a finger down the smooth scales. "This is – it's an <em>amazing</em> gift—"</p><p>"Anything that keeps you safe," she finally said, quietly, staring at the dancing reflection of the fireplace in the scales. She looked up at James, breath hitching when their eyes met.</p><p>"Hermione," murmured James, eyes fluttering shut as his head moved slowly down toward her. Her eyes closed too, in anticipation, and she felt James's hot breath on her for all of a second before his lips were against hers.</p><p>Kissing James was like – reading a book for the first time: the excitement of discovering new knowledge, that exhilarating moment when there's a twist in the story and you breathlessly don't know what is going to happen next, the high you feel with the characters as they're triumphant and the completion and satisfaction that comes in turning the last page and closing the book.</p><p>Each kiss was something new, something to discover and treasure, and Hermione pressed back against his James, tasting <em>James</em> and <em>peppermint</em> and something that was undeniably him. His mouth parted under hers and he traced his tongue along her bottom lip.</p><p>Hermione sucked in a sharp breath through her nose and turned her head as the kiss deepened, with her tasting James as his tongue swept along hers –</p><p>His hands came up and cradled the back of her head and twined into the curls there, holding her in place –</p><p>James's other hand fell hot and heavy onto her hips and then they were slowly leaning down, together, and the jacket was falling to the floor, but it wasn't alone. His golden vest joined the jacket, as did Hermione's robes, and then her button-up and bra, and James's shirt and his trousers.</p><p>Talking wasn't necessary, as their soft sighs, soft eyes, and each heated kiss pressed against skin was a declaration, a promise, a vow. Each laugh was shared joy, and each rustle of the sheets was contentment.</p><p>They didn't need to say anything – they both knew.</p><hr /><p>Later, when the rumbling from their stomachs couldn't be ignored, James pulled on his underwear and trousers and called for a house elf to bring them something to eat. Hermione snagged his button-up, and her underwear and socks, and sank to the floor in front of the coffee table in front of the fireplace, the warmth of the stoked fire heating her back.</p><p>James sat on the couch, bare-chested as he leaned forward, arranging the plates and finger foods to his liking as he told her some story about Sirius, his Auror partner, and a case they investigated.</p><p>Hermione tried to pay attention, but James's voice washed over her, fading into the background as her eyes trailed over the small spattering of freckles that covered his shoulders, and then up and over his shoulder as something flickered in the mirror hanging outside the wardrobe. What should have reflected the back of James's head, his messy black hair going in all directions, and the edge of his pale shoulder, was something else.</p><p>She froze, breath caught as her eyes met emerald green.</p><p><em>Her</em> Harry – and not the Harry the Room of Requirements used to construct from her memories and subconscious to push her into understanding her transmutation or to make philosophical decisions – stared back at her, his lips pulled back into a tiny, lopsided grin that was eerily reminiscent of James's.</p><p>But Harry was old – older than James was; he was grey at the temples, and there were wrinkles along his forehead and some by his mouth and eyes. He was tired, worn down in appearance, but it was <em>her</em> Harry – Harry as she remembered and knew him the last time she saw him, fighting side-by-side against those stupid, ignorant Purebloods who had burst into the Ministry, the Department of Mysteries and heading to the Time Room, hoping against hope to find a time turner and return to the Battle of Hogwarts to help Voldemort win.</p><p>His robes were a deep red, splattered with blood and singed from spell-fire, the Head Auror black threads worn and frayed in places. Harry had dressed up that day, having spent the morning in meetings with Kingsley and then the Wizengamot, and had joined her for lunch in her office when they both heard the alarm.</p><p>The last time she heard his voice, he had been shouting, and the last spell she heard him say was his signature <em>expelliarmus</em> –</p><p>Harry's lopsided grin turned into a gentle smile. She knew that smile. Hermione had been Harry's best friend for three decades, and had known and kept his secrets, his innermost desires and fears, and could read him better than anyone else. And that smile was the same one he wore after coming from Dumbledore's office during the ceasefire at the Battle of Hogwarts.</p><p>That smile said, as clear as he could have said: <em>It's going to be okay.</em> The smile also was an <em>I love you</em>, and a <em>don't be afraid</em>.</p><p>Her eyes flicked to James, who was still arranging the food, taking out cutlery now, still talking. He hadn't noticed anything. Her eyes returned to Harry in the mirror.</p><p>His mouth twitched and his eyes brightened. He pointed at her with a glove-covered hand, and then at himself. Hermione's eyes widened, as somewhere faint in her memories, or maybe through the Room, she heard his voice as clear as if he were standing before her.</p><p>"You and me, Hermione," Harry said, his voice familiar and as comforting as drinking hot butterbeer on the coldest of winter days. "It's going to be okay; I promise. Remember? Until the end."</p><p>Hermione sharply inhaled.</p><p>Harry's image in the mirror seemed to blur as she blinked back tears that swam in her eyes. But his voice was clear. "And this, Hermione? It's not yet the end."</p><p>"Hermione?"</p><p>James's voice broke through the fog, and she blinked, the tears lingering on her eyelashes but not spilling. Hermione tore her eyes from the mirror and Harry and looked at James, immediately noticing the differences between the two, despite how similar they were in their hair and nose.</p><p>"Hey," said James, his voice gentle and concerned. He frowned, leaning across the coffee table and cupped her cheek, his thumb coming up to rub at the apple of her cheek and brush carefully at the underside of her eye, trying to stop any tears from falling. "Is something wrong?"</p><p>"I—" Hermione's eyes trailed over his shoulder, but the mirror was clear, showing most of James's back. She frowned, eyes darting around the room at other reflective pieces, like the knife's blade, or the large pitcher, but Harry was gone.</p><p>"I thought I saw something," Hermione finally murmured, brows furrowed.</p><p>James sat back, looking around the room for what Hermione could have seen, taking her seriously. "Did someone sneak in after us? Is it Crouch or Regulus?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "No – they know you're here tonight. They wouldn't bother us save the end of the world."</p><p>"Cresswell?"</p><p>"Same, and he'd go to Barty or Reg first," concluded Hermione.</p><p>James was still in Auror-mode, eyes sweeping the room and he looked like he was ten seconds away from grabbing his wand and doing a sweep of the room, barefoot. Instead, Hermione leaned forward and put her hands on his shoulders, urging him to sit back on the couch.</p><p>"It's fine," she said softly. "It's the Room of Requirements, right? It might have caught on to a stray thought either of us had and was going to change something but then stopped."</p><p>"I guess…" James slowly sat back down, running a hand through his hair anxiously. "Well… let's have some dinner."</p><p>"Is it really, though?" grinned Hermione, eyes moving to the window. Even though the room was designed to look like James's bedroom at Potter's Peak, he had been thinking of an intimate evening, and the scene outside his room was that of a foggy, mountainous terrain illuminated by a half-moon against a star-riddled blue-black sky.</p><p>He flushed. "It might be four in the afternoon… or six… so, an early dinner…"</p><p>"I <em>guess</em> that makes this acceptable," teased Hermione, and James grinned back at her, handing her a plate.</p><p>At first, they ate in silence. Hermione found her thoughts drifting back to Harry. What did he mean? She knew that they were entwined since they first met on the Hogwarts Express in 1991. It was meant to be: Hermione Granger and Harry Potter, BFFs. After what they experienced on the Horcrux hunt, their bond had entrenched them further, deeper, in their friendship, sometimes in ways that Ron, who had left them for several months, couldn't breach. So, what did Harry mean, when he said it was him and her? That it was going to be okay?</p><p>And – <em>until the end</em>. Hermione's heart skipped a few beats. She and Ron used to tell Harry that whenever he got all broody about being the Chosen One and the weight of it was too much for one set of shoulders. It meant that she and Ron would be with him, until the end – whether it was the end of Voldemort and the war (which was what happened in 1998), or if it had been the end of them and he won, and they died.</p><p>But it meant they would be together.</p><p>So, what did it mean? Hermione's lips pursed in thought even as she absently nibbled on the sandwich triangle, barely tasting the cucumber and cream cheese. Did he mean that… that Harry would <em>always</em> exist, in some form or another? Were Lily and James actually going to get together?</p><p>No – she dismissed that thought as quickly as it appeared. They were both on separate, if not parallel, paths – working together in the Order, but certainly not joined. But perhaps Harry would still be Lily's son, one day? Or… Hermione's heart fluttered (nervously or in fear, she didn't know), <em>hers</em> with James?</p><p>Or, maybe, Harry meant that it was going to be okay, and this was his way of giving her permission to move on with her life, the same way that the Room got to her years ago. To recognize her place in this new timeline. Maybe a part of her was still desperately clinging to some unknown fear, and subconsciously, the Room gave her this.</p><p>But a part of Hermione knew – that was no Room supplied Harry. That was <em>her</em> Harry, from 2027, who was in that mirror. Like a tiny gap in time and space opened for a brief, transcendent moment to give her reassurance.</p><p>She was still mulling over it when James dropped a bombshell.</p><p>"So… I fought Voldemort."</p><p>Her elbow slipped from where it rested on the coffee table and Hermione barely caught herself from slamming her chin into the wood. "What?"</p><p>James fiddled nervously with his fork, rolling it across his empty plate, letting the tines ring as they hit. "Um. Back at – um, Halloween?"</p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes. "Are you telling me or asking me?"</p><p>He winced. "I don't – I don't like remembering it, much. It was… at the Bones'…"</p><p>Hermione's shoulders slumped. She reached forward and twined her fingers with his free hand. "Was it the first time you'd…" <em>Fought,</em> she tried to finish. <em>Fought with the Order</em>, she thought to herself.</p><p>"Yeah," nodded James, his voice a bare whisper. "He was toying with me. The whole time."</p><p>"Voldemort?"</p><p>James's head jerked up at Hermione, clearly surprised to hear that she was unafraid to say his name. He swallowed, his Adam's apple bobbing in his throat. "I thought I was doing well against his Death Eaters. I didn't realize I killed two until after… but I was fighting him, and it was hard… and then it was easy. But he was just <em>testing</em> me. He wanted me to join him."</p><p>"I'm not surprised," muttered Hermione, looking at their joined hand. "You're powerful and smart, and a transfiguration genius. You're also a Pureblood, and from a Light family. It would be a coup getting you. It would add legitimacy to his ideologies."</p><p>"I would never!" spat James angrily.</p><p>"I know," soothed Hermione. "I know you wouldn't."</p><p>The two sat, miserably, in silence. James was brooding, face twisted into a scowl, and facing the fireplace, and Hermione was contemplative as she eyed him.</p><p>Finally, James looked at her. "D'you think he's going to try to recruit you?"</p><p>"Who – Voldemort?"</p><p>James nodded.</p><p>Hermione paused, wondering if she should mention Travers and Wilkes – James would appreciate knowing, a head's up for them once they graduated so that the Aurors could keep an eye on them – but he would also be predictably worried. Instead, Hermione hedged, "There's been a few… implied statements made by people over the months, but nothing overt—"</p><p>"People are approaching you?" James's mouth dropped open. "Who?</p><p>"It doesn't matter—"</p><p>"It <em>does</em> matter—"</p><p>"James," said Hermione forcefully, if not quietly, "What would you do? If I told you the names of those sixth and seventh years, even the few fifth years, what would you do with that knowledge?"</p><p>"I'd… I'd…" James's hazel eyes darted around the room, searching for an answer, and then he slumped. "I'd do nothing because Moody would ask where I got the information and if it was credible, and he wouldn't take my girlfriend's word as strong enough evidence to place them under surveillance."</p><p>"Not without proof, no," agreed Hermione with a soft sigh. "I'm really sorry."</p><p>"Me, too," whispered James, voice strained. He gave a weary chuckle. "I didn't imagine our night would end like this."</p><p>"It might be something we need to get used to," suggested Hermione. She got up from the floor and eased next to James on the couch, snuggling into his side as she curled her bare legs under her. "I don't think things will get any better."</p><p>James frowned, pulling Hermione tight to his side. "Don't think that – we're doing what we can."</p><p>"I thought you said the Aurors were overrun?"</p><p>James froze, his hand spasming slightly on her shoulder. "Er… yeah. But… you know. We're doing what we can."</p><p><em>So, you meant the Order,</em> thought Hermione with a mental sigh. She didn't need the confirmation, but that was enough to know he was already working for Dumbledore – if the Bones attack wasn't enough. The Aurors would've been called, but saying he fought Voldemort? He'd been there early enough that only another Order member could've called for help.</p><p>"And so will you," continued James, pulling Hermione from her thoughts.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>He peered down at her. "You'll help, too, I'm sure. You're going to graduate soon, and I know you'll be brilliant at anything you do."</p><p>"Are you saying you think I should join the Auror Corps.?" teased Hermione, wondering just what James would confess to.</p><p>He laughed, rubbing the side of his nose and dislodging his glasses as he did so. "No, I don't think you'd take orders from Moody that well."</p><p>Hermione snorted her agreement.</p><p>"Just – there are more things that you could do than join the Ministry to fight against Voldemort," said James, hesitantly.</p><p>Hermione hummed but didn't ask what, and James didn't say anything else. Instead, the two both looked into the fire, even as the flames turned from orange to a dull red as the fire fizzled out and the room darkened around them.</p><p>James's hand, his fingers running up and down her shoulder, was comforting and the two were lulled into a semi-doze. But Hermione couldn't help but wonder if this was the beginning of the end for them: how else would James react when she turned Dumbledore down? Because surely, it wouldn't just be her – but Regulus and Barty, too.</p><p>Would James still believe the best in her? Would he think that she was a coward? Or would he realize that there was more going on to Hermione Evans?</p><p>
  <em>And if he did realize she wasn't quite what he thought she was – how was he going to react?</em>
</p><p>The thought was heavy in Hermione's mind, and there was a sour taste on her tongue. No matter how much she snuggled next to the warm young man at her side, Hermione couldn't help but shiver.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>April 1979</strong>
</p><p>After deciding to remain at Hogwarts instead of going to Cokeworth to see her family (<em>and Lily,</em> a part of her whispered, not like she was actively trying to avoid her sister or something), Hermione received a thick envelope from Petunia instead of the short return note she was expecting. It arrived in the middle of breakfast, but only Barty and Regulus seemed to have any idea what she had received if their wide-eyed expressions meant anything.</p><p>Eagerly, Hermione shoved it into her bookbag and did her best to nonchalantly leave the Great Hall, Barty at her side. They went straight to their usual practice room and waited for Regulus, who appeared a few minutes later.</p><p>"Well?" he demanded as soon as he shut the door behind him, wand already moving as he set up privacy wards.</p><p>Hermione ripped the envelope open, and pulled out a thick wad of A4 paper, with typed notes on it. Barty took some of the paper and began to spread the sheets out across the desks, whistling at the extensive family tree Petunia included for the Riddles (which went back to the Middle Ages) and a few patchy bits she could fill in about Merope Gaunt's time in the non-magical world.</p><p><em>I wish I could have more to give you,</em> Petunia's letter began apologetically, which made Hermione snort. This was far more than she expected! <em>But without access to your Ministry records or newspapers, I can't add more to the Gaunt family line. And honestly, after what you told me about this dark wizard, I didn't want to visit the Leaky Cauldron even with Sean in case something happened. Sorry!</em></p><p>"She did this in four months?" gapped Regulus, rubbing his fingers against the strange feel of the mass-produced paper.</p><p>"Tuney is <em>really</em> good at finding things out when she wants," laughed Hermione, pulling one sheet toward her. "Look at this… a timeline! She took what she knew about his birthdate and Hogwarts graduation and managed to figure out where he was right afterward."</p><p>"She has <em>interviews</em>, Hermione," sputtered Barty, holding stapled sheets in his other hand. "Interviews with people who were in the same orphanage as him. And they're <em>detailed</em>. This Billy Stubbs is practically vicious in explaining how he thought Riddle killed his rabbit and how weird he was as a kid…"</p><p>"He popped up every so often in the Muggle world," exclaimed Regulus. "Always around Little Hangleton. There's an Auror report here—"</p><p>"Police," corrected Hermione absently as she went through some more notes.</p><p>"—About the Riddle family caretaker's murder charges formally discharged due to a lack of evidence," continued Regulus, engrossed. "Apparently someone was researching Riddle back then and they found out there was a son. He became a suspect."</p><p>"There's a photo!" gasped Barty, who had rummaged through the envelope.</p><p>Hermione and Regulus moved quickly to crowd Barty, and the three of them stared down at the small collection he had in his hands. The first was a formal photograph, faded with some cracks, but the family of three was clear: a young man with slicked-back hair standing next to his father with similar features and a skinny woman who sat in the chair in front of them. The men were in fashionable three-piece suits, dark colours, while the woman was in a slinky dress with a furry stole around her shoulders with a fancy cap pinned to her rolled hair.</p><p>Barty flipped it over and read the back. "William Riddle, Cynthia Riddle, and son Thomas Riddle. Nineteen-eleven."</p><p>"He looks like his father," breathed Regulus, eyes glued on Thomas Riddle. A shaking hand reached out to hover above the younger man in the photo. "Tall. The slicked-back hair. The face."</p><p>Hermione and Barty looked at Regulus in concern. Hermione touched his shoulder. "Are you going to be okay?"</p><p>He nodded and Barty continued to flip through what Petunia included. "A photo of Wool's Orphanage; one of Riddle's year at the orphanage – oh, look, there's Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop – Petunia had interviews with them, too… Another photograph of Little Hangleton – <em>wow, </em>is that the Riddle house? Looks right out of a Pureblood's catalog!"</p><p>Hermione turned back to the letter she had, and the type notes in bullets. "Petunia's also listed a few places that she thinks he thought was important during his earlier years – she had the cave listed here."</p><p>"Where we found the locket?" confirmed Regulus, a bit pale and shaky, but participating in the conversation. He took a deep breath to steady himself.</p><p>"So, the cave – I think Bishop and Benson mention it in their interview," muttered Barty, flipping back to those notes. He quickly scanned them. "They won't say what happened there, but they mentioned the beach and caves specifically."</p><p>"Hogwarts, and the diadem," added Regulus. "Clearly, the cave was where he came into his power; maybe we should check Wool's out this summer. Hogwarts meant everything to him, right? Escaping the Muggles and learning he's a wizard."</p><p>"I think Little Hangleton is worth exploring," added Hermione slowly. "That's where he learned of his wizard heritage, right? Being the heir to Slytherin through the Gaunt line?"</p><p>Regulus made a face. "It'll be a mess. Wizards don't repossess family homes, and if the Gaunts lived there, it'll be a ruin."</p><p>"A good place to hide something if no one will visit," pointed out Barty. "Also, Gaunt. That sounds familiar."</p><p>Regulus frowned, agreeing. "There was something in the <em>Prophet</em>, wasn't there? I think Grandfather Pollux mentioned it—"</p><p>"Yeah, but like, in the '40s. Grandmother mentioned it in passing because the wizard had previously been Sacred-28," continued Barty with a frown of his own, licking his lips nervously with his tongue flick. "Morfin Gaunt, right? Last of the line and died in Azkaban for murdering three Muggles…"</p><p>As he trailed off, the three teenagers turned back to the timeline Petunia wrote and the death-date for the Riddles in 1943, all of whom had been murdered at the same time in a wartime home invasion where nothing was stolen.</p><p>"Cave, Hogwarts, Little Hangleton," said Hermione firmly. "For sure."</p><p>"And Uncle Alphard mentioned Bellatrix receiving an item," added Regulus quietly. "So instead of leaving his horcruxes in places, he's giving it to his minions. Bella wouldn't keep it at the Lestrange house, though."</p><p>"Definitely not!" agreed Barty. "It'll be in Gringott's."</p><p>Regulus made a face. "She hates goblins. She hates all creatures."</p><p>Hermione blinked. "Yes, but… a wizard can't exactly rob Gringott's, can they? It would be a declaration of war. And no one has ever broken into Gringott's."</p><p><em>Yet, </em>she added mentally.</p><p>Regulus looked between his two friends. "I hope you're not suggesting <em>we</em> break into Gringott's!"</p><p>Hermione chewed on her lower lip. "No, I don't think that will be necessary…"</p><p>Barty raised his eyebrows, catching Hermione's unspoken thought: <em>Now, but maybe in the future</em>.</p><p>Regulus sighed, changing the subject. "Well, who else does he trust enough to guard a piece of his soul?"</p><p>"Probably his old friend crowd," allowed Barty. "We should check the Hogwarts yearbooks."</p><p>Game plan set, they gathered up the notes Petunia sent and stuffed them back in the envelope for Hermione to charm and then layer a Notice-Me-Not. They weren't going to take any chances with that information falling in the wrong hands.</p><p>"We're going to have to dedicate ourselves to this," sighed Regulus as they tore down his privacy wards. "We're only at Hogwarts for another two months."</p><p>"It'll be enough time. There's only seven yearbooks to review," soothed Hermione.</p><p>"And some of the professors would've been teaching here at the time," added Barty with a grin as they left the room. "We can interview them!"</p><p>"And say what? 'Hello Professor Dumbledore, I'm interested in a previous student of yours.' What do you think <em>he'd</em> think of that, huh?" Regulus asked, crossing his arms.</p><p>"I'd be delighted to speak with you."</p><p>Barty shrieked and whirled, facing the voice which had come from behind the three of them. Hermione was clutching at her collarbone in shock and Regulus had significantly paled.</p><p>Dumbledore, in radiant purple robes, smiled at them. "When was this student at Hogwarts?"</p><p>Hermione, trying to calm her racing heart, stuttered, "The forties."</p><p>Dumbledore's twinkling blue eyes began to dull. "That was a rather turbulent time. Several students left Hogwarts or only remained in the castle for a few months before moving on. We had an abundant number of foreign students that decade, due to the Muggle war…"</p><p>"They would've graduated in 1944," explained Regulus, eyes downcast and to the side as he fidgeted slightly. He fiddled with his Slytherin tie when he finally looked up at the Headmaster's robes. "And in Slytherin."</p><p>There was a heavy silence. "You're speaking of the Head Boy. Tom Riddle."</p><p>Three eyes shot to Dumbledore. He looked rather solemn between the three teenagers; his mouth slightly turned down underneath the white of his beard. Finally, he sighed. "I cannot stop you with your investigation, but I must warn you: the wizard who Tom grew up to be would not like it very much if three teenagers began turning over his rocks."</p><p>Barty shot Hermione a glance, even as Regulus stuttered out, "W-We understand, Professor Dumbledore."</p><p>He nodded once at them, in goodbye, and continued down the hall.</p><p>"What was that about?" muttered Barty.</p><p>"A warning," answered Hermione thoughtfully. "But not an order to stop."</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>June 1979</strong>
</p><p>Hogwarts did not have a ceremonial graduation. Seventh-year students wrote their N.E.W.T.s, beginning with a frantic fervor that ultimately descended into passivity as soon as they put their quill down for their last test.</p><p>Hermione and Barty both decide to completely murder their brains, taking all courses offered and a total of twelve N.E.W.T.s (although Hermione only wrote ten, having already completed two N.E.W.T.s early in her Hogwarts career) while Regulus decided for a highly competent nine; each was satisfied with how they did as they met up after the last one – History – and walked from the Great Hall to their spot by the lake.</p><p>"One week to relax and then," sighed Barty, a downturn curl to his lips, "Reality."</p><p>"Reality intruded awhile ago," replied Hermione wryly. "It just means that we start immediately with our project."</p><p>"To the Haberdashery then?" offered Regulus as they strolled across the bright green grass.</p><p>Barty stretched his arms high above his head, his Oxford untucking from his trousers as he did so. "Unless <em>someone</em> has plans," he teased, glancing at their female friend.</p><p>"Plans?" she replied, curiously.</p><p>"He means with Potter," said Regulus, eyeing Barty and then rolling his eyes. "In Pureblood circles, couples become engaged the summer following their graduation."</p><p>Hermione blinked, once, twice, and then sputtered, "<em>Engaged? </em>What? No - No–"</p><p>There was some more teasing as they made it to the lake, and then the three fell into a comfortable silence as they all but collapsed in their usual spot, slightly hidden by the gentle knoll of the hill that sloped down to a natural shoreline by the Forbidden forest.</p><p>Barty was flat on his back, soaking up the strong June sun as he lightly dozed. Regulus had a book out that he was reading, sitting cross-legged and Hermione was idly playing with a transmutation of the pebbles at the shoreline, smoothing the rocks into slick granite before separating them into their individual stones again and again for control and practice.</p><p>It was Barty, who, sometime later, sat up and muttered lowly, "Don't look now Reg, but your shadowy gremlin found us."</p><p>"What?" Regulus' head popped up from his book, a scowl on his face as his grey eyes glanced in the direction Barty was looking, only to see Rabastan Lestrange striding toward them determinedly. The fifth-year seemed to be muttering to himself, his mouth moving, but they couldn't hear what he was saying.</p><p>Regulus groaned loudly.</p><p>Hermione elbowed him in the side. "Cheer up, at least you know that Voldemort is still under the assumption that you're as Black as your cousins."</p><p>Regulus scowled at her. "Piss off, Hermione."</p><p>Barty sniggered, throwing an arm over his eyes to block the sun, but from her angle, Hermione could see his eyes were open, a watchful slice of brown. Hermione let her hand drop from her transmutations and watched as Rabastan appeared over the crest of their knoll, clearly pausing as he surveyed the three graduating seventh years.</p><p>"Hello, Black," greeted Rabastan slowly, eyes twitching toward Hermione and Barty. Through gritted teeth, he forced out, "Evans. Crouch."</p><p>Regulus put down his book with a heavy sigh. "Hullo, Lestrange. Fancy you finding us."</p><p>The fifth-year took that as an invitation and happily loped down the hill, flinging himself at Regulus's side, crossing his legs and then daintily picking off the blades of grass that stuck to his knees. Then he peered up at Regulus and said, "Congratulations on finishing your N.E.W.T.s! Are you excited about graduating? Have you thought about your future plans?"</p><p>Barty snorted, loudly, and then attempted to turn it into the most pathetic fake-snore that fooled no one. Hermione rolled her eyes and stood up to stand at the pebble beach she had been previously transmuting, her back to Regulus and Rabastan. She began skipping stones, watching them skim the water before sinking with loud <em>plops</em>.</p><p>Regulus's voice was a bit high when he echoed, "Future plans?"</p><p>"Yeah," said Rabastan. He sounded eager. "Does your father have plans for you to join him at the Wizengamot? On the Black seat? Will you be taking over the Black estate now that your older brother is disinherited? Will you be joining the season? I'm sure your cousin would be pleased to introduce you to the right sort of people."</p><p>"If that's a thinly-veiled jibe at us, baby Lestrange, you'll have to do better," called Hermione from over her shoulder. "I thought Slytherins were <em>cunning</em>."</p><p>Rabastan sent a scowl at Hermione's back and then turned back to Regulus. "So?"</p><p>"Father doesn't work," he finally said, after clearing his throat. "He spends time at the Ministry – I dunno, bribing people."</p><p>Rabastan's mouth dropped open like he couldn't believe that Regulus had admitted that so openly. "I beg your pardon?"</p><p>"You have it," replied Regulus, absently, and then blanched when he realized his gib response was something he'd have said to Hermione or Barty, and not a fifteen-year-old who didn't realize that he was being used to spy on them for his older brother, and by extension, the Dark Lord. He cringed. "I'm not sure about joining the season – whatever Cissy thinks. I want to leave my options open, though."</p><p>Rabastan beamed. "Having many options is a good idea, but there are really only a few <em>right</em> options for the Black heir."</p><p>Barty snorted again, this time not even attempting to feint the snore. He sat up, bracing himself on both arms, and stared incredulously at Rabastan. "Look, is there something in the air? Even Travers did a better job of being subtle in his recruitment speech, and he's a <em>Ravenclaw</em>. Gremlin, we can see right through you, and all I'm hearing is <em>desperation</em> in how badly this Dark Lord wants us."</p><p>Hermione's pebble didn't even skip as her wrist-flick fell flat, and she turned to stare at Barty at his blatant comment. Regulus's mouth had dropped open, unattractively, and even Rabastan appeared startled, eyes wide.</p><p>"I—I don't—I'm not—" Rabastan badly stuttered, eyes darting at Regulus for help, and then even Hermione. Both were frozen, flabbergasted. He finally looked back at Barty, who had a dark look on his face. It was enough that the teenager gulped.</p><p>"I already told Travers no, and I'll keep saying it," continued Barty hotly. "And now you can go back and tell your brother or the dark wizard he's following, the same. I'm not interested. I'm not interested in hearing stupid recruitment speeches, and I'm not interested in whatever swill he's trying to sell us through second- and third-hand salesmen."</p><p>"Barty," cautioned Regulus.</p><p>"He's just a kid," added Hermione, softly.</p><p>"He should know better," replied Barty, with a heavy scowl. "He might be a kid, but he should be smart enough to know what's waiting for all of us next week."</p><p>Rabastan dramatically paled, so quickly that he swooned where he sat. "How—"</p><p>Barty's scowl turned into a sneer. "You know? As graduates? Going out into a world that's at war?"</p><p>"It's not war," protested Regulus immediately. "Don't say stuff like that—"</p><p>"Okay, Barty, I think it's time we got some sugar in you," interrupted Hermione, moving swiftly to his side. "I think Dirk's got a Honeyduke's stash he's been saving – why don't we go see him, hmmm?"</p><p>She reached down, holding a hand for Barty to take. He stared at it for a moment, and then reached out, allowing himself to be hauled up. For a long moment, they just stood, holding hands, with Barty's head bowed while Hermione looked up at him earnestly.</p><p>"Fine," he finally muttered, running a hand through his light brown hair.</p><p>Hermione turned to look at Regulus, extending her free hand, the one that Barty wasn't gripping tightly. She wriggled her fingers. "C'mon you. Don't tell me you don't relish the idea of unnerving the Gryffindors by stepping into their common room."</p><p>Regulus lit up. "I would enjoy that. Can you imagine Cresswell's face?"</p><p>Rabastan turned his head between Barty, Regulus, and Hermione.</p><p>"I'll just… I'll just go, then," muttered Rabastan with a frown. He was still pale, and his eyes kept darting nervously at Barty. "I was… I was hoping to join you on the train for a bit, Regulus. So, we could finish our… our talk?"</p><p>Barty snorted and Rabastan flinched.</p><p>"I –" Regulus stopped, glancing at Hermione and Barty.</p><p>Barty violently shook his head, but Hermione shrugged. "Your decision."</p><p>Regulus scowled, the tiniest amount, but then closed his eyes, coming to some sort of internal decision. "Fine. But you need to be polite."</p><p>Rabastan nodded furiously, launching to his feet. "I will! Thank you!"</p><p>He glanced at Hermione, opened his mouth to say something and then thought better of it, snapping his mouth shut. He began to skirt around Barty with a wide berth, never turning his back on the tall Ravenclaw until he was up over the knoll and quickly retreating toward Hogwarts.</p><p>"Are we still going?" asked Regulus after a few moments of silence.</p><p>"Yes," answered Barty forcefully, tugging at Hermione's hand and beginning up the hill. She tripped after him, Regulus following.</p><p>"Slow down, Barty!" she cried, tugging back at his hand as he kept a face clip across the Hogwarts grounds, cutting across the same place where Lily, Snape, and Sirius had their battle of words after their O.W.L.s. "Why're you in a rush?"</p><p>He spun around, dropping Hermione's hand just as she and Regulus skidded to a stop. "Don't you feel it?"</p><p>"Feel what?" asked Regulus, looking around intently, hoping to see what Barty saw. There was nothing obvious to him: a bunch of upper years enjoying the weather outside while the younger years wrote their in-class exams, some groups of friends by the lake, and a couple of Hufflepuffs with brooms heading to the Quidditch pitch.</p><p>Barty shuddered. "I feel it all the time, now. Like we're being watched. It's Travers and Wilkes, in the Ravenclaw common room. Others, in the Great Hall, like Lestrange, or Penderghast. Sometimes, in our classes, too."</p><p>"Oh, Barty…" Hermione's face was pinched. "How long have you felt like this?"</p><p>"All year," he answered, miserably. He kicked at the ground and then spat, "I'm so sick of it. Why can't they leave us alone? We're never going to join them – the Death Eaters or Dumbledore's group – so why can't they just <em>stop</em>?"</p><p>"They are never going to stop," said Regulus, firmly. He stepped up to Barty, drawing his eyes. "You know that. And you know why."</p><p>"It's my fault," fretted Hermione. "I'm sorry – I should've been more careful –"</p><p>"It was going to happen eventually, with or without you, Hermione," sighed Regulus. "Stop being stupid, it doesn't suit you. It's because of my family and last name, and Barty's father and his name. They'd have approached us eventually, whichever side."</p><p>He glanced at her and then gave a wan smile. "At least, with you, we chose because you're our friend. And we know what we're getting into. Do you think those poor sods – those new Death Eaters – have any idea what they're signing on for?"</p><p>"Do you think Dumbledore's going to treat his people any better?" snorted Barty, crossing his arms. "You told us what James told you about the Bones attack, Hermione. Let's not all delude ourselves, here: he might not have seen it, being too Gryffindor, but we did. Battle lines are being drawn. You're with us, or against us. It didn't matter if, if… Voldemort or Dumbledore said it. It's the same either way."</p><p>Regulus was nodding. "We're in the wandsight of powerful wizards. Barty may be a bit paranoid—"</p><p>"<em>Hey</em>!"</p><p>"—but he's not wrong," finished Regulus, ignoring their friend as he pouted. "Things are changing."</p><p>Hermione sighed. "Well, this whole conversation was a downer, thanks, boys."</p><p>Barty gave Hermione a crooked grin. "Happy to provide you with a daily dose of reality, Hermione." He reached out and gently tugged on a curl. "Sometimes you're a smidge too optimistically Gryffindor and need to be reminded that you're a <em>Ravenclaw</em>."</p><p>"Oh, how terrible," drawled Hermione, "To be a Gryffindor."</p><p>"Very," deadpanned Regulus with a nod. "Now. While Barty's paranoia is, in some ways, useful, and I think we should be on our guard until we're safe at the Haberdashery, you mentioned Honeydukes and aggravating Cresswell. Can we go back to that, now? I want to finish of my Hogwarts career on that delightful note."</p><p>Hermione grinned, looping her arm through Regulus's. "You got it."</p><p>Barty looped Hermione's arm through his on her other side. "One last, happy hurrah?"</p><p>"One last," agreed Regulus, his smile sad and nostalgic, as they began walking toward Hogwarts.</p><p>And later, once they had successfully snuck into the Gryffindor common room, guessing the Fat Lady's password, Dirk's resounding shriek of outrage when he learned that Barty and Regulus had finished off the last of his Honeyduke's stash (that he was saving for his final Gryffindor party), was enough to push back their worries.</p><p>Temporarily, at least.</p><hr /><p>Hermione wanted to be jittery. The Hogwarts Express ride back to London was always fraught with tension: whether it was between her and Lily, or Snape, or even James's friends; and this ride was no different.</p><p>She tried to tell herself it was because she no longer had the security and safety of returning to Hogwarts in two months' time. That she was now an adult and out in the wizarding world. And the last time this happened to her, her legality in the wizarding world, she was Undesirable Number Two, with over a thousand galleons posted to her capture.</p><p>But Barty's equally tense frame, despite his languid sprawl next to her on the plush red velvet seat, and Regulus's slightly pinched expression, told her she was not alone in her fears. When their compartment door slid open and all three had their wands up and out, pointed at the intruder. Rabastan froze, blue eyes wide as he stared down at the wands before slowly sliding to the hard faces.</p><p>"Erm. Sorry?" he stuttered, pale eyes darting around the compartment. "Should I come back later? I know you said I could join you–"</p><p>Regulus sighed and slid his wand back into his holster, while Barty and Hermione did the same with their wands, secreting them away somewhere. "It's fine, Lestrange."</p><p>The fifth-year and brother to his cousin's husband inched into the compartment, shutting the door behind him. He sat on the very edge of the seat closest to the door, on Regulus' side of the compartment with his back very straight.</p><p>They were silent for a long, long moment. Hermione and Regulus stared at each other, each urging the other to begin a conversation; Barty certainly wasn't going to – his eyes were closed, head tilted back on the edge of the headrest, and had slid further down the seat with his ankle crossed over his knee and the arm that wasn't pressed against the window was along the back of the seat, his hand resting comfortably on the back of Hermione's neck, her presence grounding him.</p><p>Finally, Hermione sighed and slightly turned to Rabastan. She asked with false brightness, "So. How do you think you did on your O.W.L.s?"</p><p>It was a bland topic, but Rabastan cleared his throat and began to speak. After a few jilted starts – Rabastan still didn't like Hermione, made that clear, but hadn't tried calling her a "mudblood" again since that disastrous first time – the three had a conversation going, all blithely ignoring Barty's soft snores.</p><p>"–thought that the addition of Phoenician into a ritual around the equinox would add more power," the fifth year explained, "given the location of the language."</p><p>Regulus frowned and Hermione shook her head. "Phoenician doesn't lend to <em>Greek</em>, Lestrange – its power would be in Hebrew."</p><p>The teen glared mulishly at Hermione, ire flashing in his eyes as he argued, "It developed into Greek–"</p><p>"Which means it was altered," broke in Hermione calmly. "You'd have to offset any Phoenician arrays you've built with an understanding of the linguistic changes that occurred over time. You'd have to be near fluent in both–"</p><p>"It's a <em>dead language</em>, Evans–"</p><p>"That doesn't mean you can't study it–"</p><p>"It sure means you can't <em>apply</em> it–"</p><p>Hermione balefully stared at him. "And <em>how</em> were you sorted into Slytherin, lacking any ambition to tackle something unknown–"</p><p>"I don't live and breathe books, you bloody m–"</p><p>"It's not like Phoenician is the fucking Voynich manuscript–"</p><p>"Okay!" broke in Regulus loudly, startling the two badly enough that they both snapped their mouths shut, despite glaring hotly at one another. Barty snorted once, twice, and woke, bringing his left hand to his mouth to wipe at a bit of drool there.</p><p>"What did I miss?" he mumbled sleepily.</p><p>"Just a stupid argument," said Regulus evenly, eyes not leaving the two. "Right?"</p><p>"Right," agreed Hermione easily, settling back into her seat.</p><p>Rabastan glowered for a long moment before muttering, "Right," and crossing his arms.</p><p>Regulus stared at them a bit longer, ensuring neither began bickering again. Then, with a sigh, he turned to Rabastan and began, quietly, "Hermione's intuitive with her runes and arrays, and can read and write nearly twelve languages fluently, most of them for runes. If she says Phoenician is closer to Hebrew, and not Greek, it probably is."</p><p>The fifth-year Slytherin flushed at the reprimand.</p><p>"And Hermione?" Regulus raised his voice and glanced at her. "Don't be such a swotty know-it-all. People can have different opinions to you."</p><p>The Ravenclaw merely rolled her eyes, and muttered very lowly under her breath, "Not when they're fucking wrong."</p><p>Regulus glared until she sighed in apology. She stared at Rabastan for a bit and then extended her hand. "Truce?"</p><p>He eyed it with distaste but shook it quickly. "Truce."</p><p>"Good," declared Regulus with a wan smile that didn't reach his eyes. The three settled into silence while Barty eyed them silently from Hermione's side.</p><p>Eventually, Rabastan sighed, and turned, digging through his satchel until he pulled out a few blank sheets of parchment and an inkpot. He hesitated a moment on a nice, expensive quill but then put it on top of the thick parchments next to the ink and held the entire thing out to Hermione.</p><p>"Could you please explain and show me how you make the connection to Hebrew?" The request was through gritted teeth, but Hermione magnanimously took the collected pieces and unscrewed the ink cap, dipping the quill in and beginning to scratch out the Phoenician alphabet, all the while chattering about how each rune developed.</p><p>Regulus watched, and then leaned forward, touching a dried rune on the paper. "I think <em>nūn </em>should be longer on the final stroke – yours looks like a wonky lightning bolt."</p><p>Hermione glared up at him, holding out the quill. "D'you wanna draw it then, oh runemaster?"</p><p>"I think I will," sniffed Regulus, although it was a bit loftily done to indicate a joke. He reached out and touched the quill, his fingers just above Hermione's near the nib, ready to take it from her.</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>Blinking, both Hermione and Regulus turned to Rabastan, their fingers frozen on the quill.</p><p>"What–"</p><p>"I'm so sorry," the fifth year said, this time not sounding at all like a pureblood snot, but rather a scared teenager. His eyes were wide and his face pale. "But I have to."</p><p>Understanding lit in Hermione and she opened to mouth to tell Regulus to let go of the quill, but Rabastian said, "<em>portus,</em>" and her fingers were glued to the writing implement, Regulus's just above hers, and Barty along for the ride with his hand still at the back of her neck as they swirled through space, colours brushing by them sickeningly until they landed in a tangle of limbs on a very cold, rough stone floor.</p><p>"Ah. My guests. Welcome," a high, cool voice greeted them.</p><p>A bunch of low chuckles and titters followed the voice and Hermione brought a hand up to push her thick curls from her face, absently shoving Regulus's leg off her shoulders. He groaned.</p><p>Standing above them, tall and proud with his hands behind his back, was Voldemort, looking far more human than she had ever seen.</p><p><em>This</em> was the wizard who charmed and weaseled his way into the pureblood families and began to sway people to cause. <em>This</em> was the wizard who had only split his soul three times, a magically powerful number.</p><p>On either side of her, Hermione felt Barty and Regulus right themselves; Regulus was minutely trembling, eyes wide and fixated on the wizard before them.</p><p>It was hard to see anything other than him; there was little light, but it looked like an underground catacomb. There were long arches made of thick stone and columns, and the low ceiling gave a claustrophobic feel to the cavernous space that stretched long and in a variety of directions, all hidden by inky darkness.</p><p>The Death Eaters - or, the early version of them that evolved from Voldemort's Knights of Walpurgis - finally had their skull masks, and the bone-white colour of them was stark against the black of their robes and passages behind them, leaving their skull heads to appear as if they were floating, ghostly visages that emerged from the darkness to stare at them.</p><p>Through thin lips, Voldemort gave a chilling parody of a smile and said, "I've been wanting to meet with you for so awfully long now. We have much to discuss, Mr. Black, Mr. Crouch, Miss Evans."</p><p>He paused to peer at them and finished, his voice a low, sibilant hiss, "<em>Don't we?</em>"</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC…</p>

We're missing the ring, and I think canon decided that Nagini was made into a Horcrux after Voldemort got his body back in 1995/TriWizard Tournament. Since Hermione's unsure of the time of TWO of them, we've only got "3" times instead of really, 5 times split into 6 pieces.</p></blockquote>

  <p align="center">Yesterday is Tomorrow (Everything is Connected)</p><p align="center">TWENTY</p><hr /><p>I want to understand if I can change it. If everything has a purpose, and if so… who decides this purpose? Coincidence? God? Or is it us? Are we actually free in our actions? Or is it all created anew, in an eternally recurring cycle? And we can only obey the laws of nature and are nothing but slaves of space and time?</p><p>– The Stranger, <em>Dark</em>, S1E8, "As You Sow, So You Shall Reap"</p><hr /><p>Before they could fully gain their bearings, three nonverbal <em>expelliarmus</em> spells hit them from three different angles around the catacomb, wrenching their wands from their holsters and pockets. The wands soared through the air, where they were caught by other Death Eaters who secreted them away into their voluminous robes.</p><p>Barty snarled, even taking a step forward after his wand, but a Death Eater raised their wand to waist height level. The message was clear: one more step, and you get hit.</p><p>Voldemort didn't seem to care what was occurring around him, as his red eyes were focused on the three teenagers. He was surveying them, looking them up and down, still in their Hogwarts uniforms.</p><p><em>How young we must look to him</em>, thought Hermione idly, surveying the Dark Lord in return. She knew that he was a strong Legilimens and fought to keep her innermost thoughts and truths of his future hidden behind carefully crafted shields while other surface thoughts were behind a much more obvious barrier for him to break through. Let him assume Regulus taught her and Barty Occlumency and did so poorly.</p><p>He looked less like the Voldemort Regulus and James described – tall with slicked back hair, pale and with red eyes – and more like the Voldemort Hermione knew from her own original time, but not quite there yet.</p><p>Somewhere, between January and June, Voldemort had lost his hair, leaving a shiny, bald head; his cheeks and face had thinned, leaving him with a long, pale face and smooth, hairless features. All Hermione could think was that he conducted another murder recently, perhaps with the ring, to create another Horcrux. That would be out of order from the other timeline, but it would explain his drastic change in appearance.</p><p>Finally, Voldemort began - although there was no obvious twitch or straightening of his shoulders. His magic seemed to vibrate in the air around him and he spoke.</p><p>"Join me," the dark wizard hissed, soft and slow. "All three of you exhibit magic in the most exquisite ways. Your power, your finesse, they mark you as <em>true</em> wizards."</p><p>His eyes turned to Hermione. "And despite your unfortunate background, Hermione Evans, your grasp on esoteric magic is – something else." He paused and then implored, again, "Join me as my faithful, and we can reshape Britain to our image."</p><p>Hermione kept silent, with the tiniest purse to her lips as her response to Voldemort's beginning spiel.</p><p>"Regulus Black," began Voldemort, sensing he needed to add more. "The dutiful son, the Slytherin son, the <em>true</em> son of the Blacks. You are from powerful, strong magical stock. I have been told of your wandless abilities and skill with a wand, no doubt thanks to your pure, double Black blood."</p><p>Regulus grimaced at the mention of his parents' close relations.</p><p>"Unlike your older brother, you understand your purpose and role, don't you?" continued Voldemort, moving slowly to circle the three. "You know the value of family, of your heritage and legacy. Of what it means to be a <em>wizard</em> and not a <em>muggle</em>."</p><p>He stopped behind Barty, who tensed as his back went ramrod straight, despite keeping his eyes forward. Hermione could see his jaw clench as he struggled, desperately wanting to turn and face the predator in the room as his lycanthrope tendencies rose to the surface of his thoughts.</p><p>"Bartemius Crouch, junior," hissed Voldemort, "The son of a long line of purebloods; and a Black cousin. You, too, have a wandless talent that my spies have spoken of, one stronger than your friend's. But more than this power, I know that you crave attention – you desire to be <em>wanted</em>. Your father has no time for you as Head Auror, this I know."</p><p>Barty froze, inhaling sharply and not exhaling as he held his breath.</p><p>He moved to stand before Barty. "<em>I</em> could be your father. I can encourage your magic and desires as you learn about yourself and your magic." He stared at the young man. "I know of your anger, your hatred for your father. <em>He deserves it</em>. He has my anger, too. Together we could punish him."</p><p>Slowly, carefully, he moved to the side and looked at Hermione, who looked back.</p><p>"How curious," he murmured, "You are not afraid of me."</p><p>Hermione did not speak.</p><p>"For a mudblood, you are… <em>exceptionally </em>powerful," he continued to hiss, his voice low. His eyes roamed Hermione's form, not sexual in nature, but considering. "You must be the child of a changeling, or from a squib line – no doubt a powerful wizarding family, given your older sister's abilities. But… you are still something <em>other</em>, are you not, Ms. Evans?"</p><p>Frowning, Hermione found she really didn't like her name on Voldemort's lips. And the implication… fear froze her veins as she remembered the hint of prophecy the Room of Requirement touched upon, and that frisson of fear settled low in her stomach as her nerves churned with the thought that one of Voldemort's loyal Death Eaters was already in the Department of Mysteries and had seen her initials on a prophecy shelf.</p><p>"I can overlook your impure blood," he declared, "if only due to your magical ability. Think of what you could accomplish at my side – what we could accomplish together!"</p><p>He moved closer to her, stepping around and to her back and side as his head moved close to her ear. "My collection is full of the most arcane and rare magics. Spells thought lost to us, spells that faded in antiquity. <em>You</em> could have those, to read through those ancient texts, and expand that mind of yours as you practice your magic."</p><p>Hermione fought a shiver – of disgust, of fear, or of want, she wasn't sure – and closed her eyes.</p><p>Voldemort's breath was as cold as his voice when it brushed against her ear, moving her hair. "With my connections across the world, you could have it all."</p><p>He then moved swiftly away, standing in his original spot. Bellatrix, unmasked and just behind him, looked very put out at the attention the three were receiving.</p><p>Voldemort's smile was wide and genial, but it seemed mocking and dangerous to Hermione as he extended his arms on either side and offered, "What do you say? Join me. Join me and have all you have ever desired."</p><p>The three were silent, their eyes nervously glancing at each other. It was one thing to know that they were actively dismantling Voldemort's soul and working to stop him when he was an abstract dark lord to someone before them, suddenly made human – however much of him <em>was</em> still human.</p><p>Had it been over a year ago - before they knew of the Horcruxes - perhaps Regulus and Barty would've been tempted. Had there been no Hermione Evans in their life. Still, it wasn't like they could rejoin, "Excuse me, Mr. Dark Lord sir, but could we have a few days to think about it?"</p><p>They had long ago set their course, and Hermione, at least, was determined to stay on it. She would not force Barty and Regulus, but she would prefer to not cross wands with them.</p><p>"I'm good, thanks," she said firmly, tucking her chin up a bit as she threw Voldemort's offer back at him. "I already have it all."</p><p>Barty - loyal, wonderful Barty - followed quickly with a firm, single-word answer. "No."</p><p>After Hermione spoke, Voldemort's face froze, and annoyance passed over it. When Barty spoke, it moved from annoyance to frustration, his eyes narrow red slits.</p><p>He turned slowly to Regulus.</p><p>"Think carefully, cousin," warned Bellatrix, speaking out of turn. It was a wobbly whisper that cut through the cavernous catacomb as loud as any shout.</p><p>Regulus barely glanced at her. "I know what my purpose and role is; I don't need you telling me what makes a Black. <em>Toujours Pur</em> - always pure."</p><p>He paused and then turned to face Voldemort. "Always pure doesn't mean blood. It means conviction and belief in one's self. A Black is one who knows who they are and what they stand for and remains true to their ideals." He then levelled a dark look at the dark wizard. "Blacks bow to no wizard."</p><p>Rage flashed across Voldemort's face, but Regulus wasn't done. With a studied, Sirius Black-casualness, he added in a voice reminiscent of his brother: "And fuck you, too, you bald pale-faced bastard."</p><p>There was a shocked silence, even as Voldemort's thin nostrils flared with anger. Magic rose thick around him as his magic manifested and the air turned molten. His Death Eaters shifted nervously where they stood.</p><p>"Master," began Bellatrix, haltingly as she stepped further into the lit part of the catacomb, pushing her hood back to reveal her bare face, free of any mask. "Master, please, he knows not what he's saying–"</p><p>"Fuck off, Bella," snapped Regulus, glancing at her.</p><p>"It's the Mudblood's fault," his cousin continued, her voice rising in pitch. "Let me curse her, let me make her beg on the dirty ground so she knows her place–"</p><p>"Enough, Bella," ordered Voldemort in the same cool tone he used when the three first appeared. She immediately snapped her mouth shut. "Your cousin is sound in mind. Unfortunately, it appears he takes after his brother more than his cousins. Perhaps the fault is his parents…"</p><p>Regulus glared back defiantly, refusing to speak.</p><p>"But… but…" hissed Voldemort, eyes moving from Regulus to Hermione and Barty. "Yes, your idea has merit."</p><p><em>Oh,</em> thought Hermione with a mental sigh. <em>This again</em>. She glanced at Bellatrix and a tiny, quick thought flickered through her: <em>at least it's unlikely she has the cursed knife this time</em>.</p><p>It always surprised her - as an adult and now, especially so - at how much Death Eaters talked about blood purity and the stain of mudbloods and muggles and muggle ways and yet, when push came to shove: they were no different. Violence beget violence.</p><p>A blast from Voldemort's wand - a strong gust of wind - knocked Hermione on off her feet and she did her best to control the wild burst of magic that rushed up in her defensively, wanting to transmute the hard stone beneath her hands as shield and protection. She ended up on her side, hands and knees scuffed and far away from her friends, who cried out in worry.</p><p>Immediately, independent of their master, a few Death Eaters moved toward Regulus and Barty. Bellatrix and her husband, Rodolphus, had a physical hold of Regulus, his arms pinned tightly to his side with them bookending him.</p><p>It was Barty who was the wildcard and caused them problems: with his strength and height, he towered over most of the Death Eaters except for Voldemort. His arms flailed as someone moved close to him, and he didn't shy away from biting if he thought he could get away with it. Eventually, a wizard rammed into him at the waist, lifting him up off his feet and slammed him to the floor, while two others used <em>immobulus </em>to hold him down in place. They kept their wands trained on him though, as Barty was already straining through the spell, nonverbally and wandlessly unweaving it, head twisted to the side and brown eyes wide as he stared at Hermione in fear.</p><p>Calmly, Hermione pushed herself up and then onto her feet, staring at the tall, pale-faced wizard as he watched her, just as impassively.</p><p>Then the Dark Lord flicked his wand. "<em>Crucio</em>."</p><p>The curse hit her with the weight of a freight train, but Hermione, who had experienced this once before, braced and took the hit, curling around her stomach as the wind was knocked out of her.</p><p>The initial strike of the pain wasn't as severe as Bellatrix's had been in her memory. Maybe Voldemort was teasing, or testing her, she wasn't sure – but while it still felt like her nerves were singed as electricity coursed through her body, it wasn't enough to knock her off her feet.</p><p>"Impressive," the Dark Lord's high-pitched voice cut through the haze of sharp pain as he released the spell.</p><p>Hermione inhaled quickly and sharply, glancing up at him from under her hair.</p><p>His thin lips curled into a parody of a smile. "<em>Very</em> impressive. What a shame."</p><p>Then he held his wand aloft and cursed again. This time, the pain was agonizing, and Hermione fell to the dirty ground, bracing her hands as her knees hit. She grunted in pain and squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>
  <em>Gods, oh gods, this hurts – so much more –</em>
</p><p><em>Whatever had removed her emotions to her memories had also removed a good deal of the memory of her torture</em>, she vaguely thought in severe displeasure. She could remember the pain from the cruciatus, could remember the feel of her skin being split from the cursed scar, the absolute fear and terror that shook through her body – but it paled in comparison to what she experienced under Voldemort's own wand.</p><p>Hermione bit through her bottom lip and blood dribbled down over her chin as she kept a scream bottled in, even as Voldemort's voice murmured, "<em>crucio</em>," again.</p><p>The third time, Hermione let out a long, hoarse cry that rattled out from her. She quickly cut it off with a sharp inhale that turned into pants. Voldemort stopped casting, giving Hermione a few moments to breathe.</p><p>Her eyes opened and caught sight of Barty, now on his stomach and straining against the spells that held him in place. He dragged himself a few feet toward her, her name on his lips, even as two masked Death Eaters stepped forward and cast on him again, freezing him in place. His shirt had pulled out of his trousers, revealing the long, silver gashes from Remus's werewolf form.</p><p>"Look at this," muttered one of the Death Eaters, nudging at Barty's frozen form. "Looks like he's been mauled by a wolf."</p><p>Bellatrix laughed derisively, yanking on Regulus's arm. He tried to pull back. "Aw, does his big, bad, Auror daddy know that his son his a disgusting halfbreed?"</p><p>"Enough, Bella," the Dark Lord commanded as he walked toward Hermione. She lay panting, staring up at the ceiling and then him.</p><p>With casual disdain, used the toe of his boot against her shoulder to knock her back. Hermione grunted and fell on her side, rolling to avoid his boot a second time.</p><p>"The fact you can still move to avoid me," sighed Voldemort, "is a sign of your magic, girl. Many men have lost their mind under my wand, and none survive a fourth go."</p><p>"<em>I've – had – worse</em>," gasped Hermione between words, glaring at him.</p><p>Although eyebrow-less, an expression of interested surprise reflected on Voldemort's face.</p><p>"Is that so?" he queried softly.</p><p>Shakily, Hermione pushed to her knees, and then to her feet, wobbling in place. She brought the back of her hand to her mouth and wiped at the trickle of blood from her split lip, smearing it across her jaw. There were some surprised murmurs from the Death Eaters at her defiance. She then did her best to stand straight.</p><p>"<em>Crucio."</em></p><p>Hermione grimaced at the pain, buckling almost immediately as she fell to the floor. Her back bowed and her fingers clawed at the stone, breaking some of her nails and leaving a line of blood. But she held in her shriek of pain.</p><p>Then Voldemort repeated the spell, and the pain sent her to her stomach as she curled protectively into a ball, her entire form shaking as thousands of burning hot knives plunged into her body from every angle, unable to escape them as her muscles twitched and spasmed as her nerves were abused.</p><p>She began to lose track of time. But then, the spell ended, and she got to her feet. Slowly, shakily. She took longer, often stumbling back to her knees several times before finally standing tall. Finally, she saw Regulus, pale-faced and hanging limply in Rodolphus's arms, grey eyes wide and stuck firmly on her. It looked like he had thrown up, mess still on his chin and down the front of his Hogwarts blazer.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and turned back to Voldemort. Breathlessly, she panted out, "Is that the best you've got? I could do this all day."</p><p>Something passed across Voldemort's red eyes - too quickly for her to figure out what it was. But then he hissed, <em>"crucio</em>," and this time, she went straight to the floor, her knees cracking as they hit the stone.</p><p>The spell was different from his other castings, far more powerful and maleficent. The knives were not just burning hot, it felt like she was being doused in acid and her skin was flayed from her in tiny slivers, slowly, one strip at a time.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>The pain was never-ending. She bit through her lip again, sending fresh blood down her chin and took a knock to her head as her body twisted and writhed against the curse, seeking a way to avoid the pain despite Hermione rationally knowing escape was not possible.</p><p><em>This</em> was how Neville's parents lost their minds – a continuously cast spell, a never-ending torture. Hermione could escape into her mind, but she knew she'd never return if she did that. And she had plans, things to do.</p><p>Despite the tears leaking from her eyes, and her blurry vision, her head fell to the side and she spotted Regulus, staring at her. His gaze was unwavering, despite his pallor. <em>I'm with you,</em> his eyes seem to say, even as the words stuck in his throat.</p><p>But Barty, on the other hand, was <em>screaming</em> alongside her, his voice thinning as they both continued to holler in tandem, wordless cries that meant nothing to those around her except to share in sympathy her pain.</p><p>They were depending on her. And so, she gritted her teeth and let her back bow, closing her eyes, and breathed in as deeply as she could. <em>You've survived this before. You can do so again</em>.</p><p>The pain began to disappear, and her nerves numbed. Her back lowered and she spread her fingers, palm side down, to feel the cold stone beneath her. Her magic hummed, just under her veins, angry and wanting to lash out. Instead, she allowed herself to feel the flow of her magic, the magic around her, deep underground, and opened herself to it. The sense of magic grounded her, and the pain disappeared.</p><p>Vaguely, she heard Voldemort cast again. The pain returned with a vengeance, and she cried out hoarsely. But she focused on the thought: <em>You've survived this before. You can do so again</em>, feeling the magic as it ebbed and flowed within her, in time to her breathing. It became a mantra, and slowly, the pain began to disappear again, although with it, her awareness of the catacombs, too.</p><p>The last thing she heard, before fading into a semi-lucid state, was Voldemort's voice. "Take them somewhere they can't escape. We shall see how a day in a dungeon changes their minds."</p><hr /><p>Although she had never spent time in the Malfoy dungeons, Harry and Ron <em>had</em> and between them, and Luna, she had a fairly good idea of their layout and defenses. Of course, there was a kind of irony involved, double-layered, that Hermione could neither escape fighting in the war and that ultimately, she would always be tortured with the cruciatus and end up at Malfoy Manor.</p><p><em>Life was funny that way</em>, she found herself thinking as she was bodily flung into the rectangular cellar that looked familiar to the catacombs, except damper, with lichen growing in the corners of the walls and up some of the smooth, stone columns.</p><p>She caught herself, despite the tremble in her legs from the aftereffects of the cruciatus, and slowly, wearily, made her way to one of the columns opposite a tiny, grate-covered window. She was panting, there was a faint sheen of sweat on her skin, and dried tears that left shiny imprints on her cheeks that mingled with the bloody smears from her split lip that dribbled down her chin, throat, and to the front of her white button-up.</p><p>Regulus walked in on his own, although he shook off Bellatrix's hands with a scowl at the bottom of the stairs. He made his way directly to Hermione's side and wrapped an arm around her, helping to take some of her weight.</p><p>His cousin eyed them distastefully, a sneer on her thin lips. "So, you prefer taking it from a mudblood whore, too, just like your blood traitor brother."</p><p>"I guess I do," replied Regulus, dryly, even as he turned from Bellatrix to help Hermione slide to the damp floor. "I guess I really am just like Sirius."</p><p>Hermione grinned up at him. He even sounded proud of it.</p><p>Barty, however, was snarling, fighting the wizards that held him, until one finally had enough. He was thrown from the top of the stairs, crashing, and rolling down each stone step. He landed at the bottom, hitting the open grate of the cellar door. It clanged loudly as he did so.</p><p>Hermione pushed herself to her feet but still leaning heavily against the column, indignant, as she shouted, "<em>Barty!</em>"</p><p>Regulus rushed forward, but Bellatrix stepped in his path and held her wand up, aloft, pointed at his chest. "Ah, ah, ah, little coz – leave the half-breed alone."</p><p>"He's not a half-breed!" protested Regulus. "He's a wizard! A human being!"</p><p>Barty's form groaned, his body uncurling itself. The wizards who flung him reached him at the bottom of the steps first and used his confusion and pain to drag him into the cellar, away from Regulus, Hermione, and Bellatrix. He was left in a heap in a dark recess.</p><p>"Use the time you're down here to think about your loyalties, little coz," hissed Bellatrix, her voice soft and sibilant as she tried to mimic Voldemort's own cool, pitched voice. "We'll check in on you later."</p><p>Regulus stared at Bellatrix as she backed away, slowly, until she moved out of the cellar with the other Death Eaters. Then, the gate closed behind her and the three were left alone.</p><p>Hermione took a few fumbling steps forward and then stumbled; Regulus was at her side and with his arms around her, he half-carried her across to Barty where they fell to their knees.</p><p>"Barty?" whispered Hermione, reaching out and touching his side.</p><p>"'M fine…" He groaned and rolled onto his back and blinked woozily at the two. "Why's there four of you? I had a dream like this once, but it didn't hurt as much..."</p><p>Regulus snorted. "He'll be fine."</p><p>Both Hermione and Regulus arranged themselves around Barty, who winced as he eased himself up into a seated position, leaning against the cold, wet wall beneath a small grated window. Hermione was next to him on his right, and Regulus found himself on Barty's other side.</p><p>"Well," shakily began the Slytherin, stretching his legs out straight in front of himself, "We had a good run."</p><p>Hermione rolled her head so that she was facing him, her bloodied chin touching her shoulder as she did so. Bits of dried blood flaked off.</p><p>Her brow furrowed. "What do you mean, a good run?"</p><p>Regulus blinked back. "Well, we're stuck in a dungeon. No one knows where we are. We just told a Dark Lord off. I don't think we're getting out of this one alive."</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes and turned away.</p><p>Barty sighed and shook his head in an exaggerated, rueful way.</p><p>"Oh, ye of so little faith," he teased, stretching a bit, and moaning softly in pain. "Hermione'll get us out, Reggie."</p><p>He paused and glanced at her. "But, uh, maybe in a few hours once she's had time to rest."</p><p>"We're in a <em>dungeon</em>." Regulus stared at Barty, but both Hermione and Barty had their eyes closed and missed his expression of disbelief. Was he the only one appropriately worried? He felt his heart begin to pound in his chest and his breaths quickened. "Hermione was <em>tortured</em> with an Unforgivable. They kept you from moving, Barty! They're going to do worse. I just know it."</p><p>"Yeah," wheezed Barty, hand fluttering to his side where one Death Eater had kicked at him, "That wasn't really pleasant."</p><p>"At least it wasn't the cruciatus, so that's a plus," added Hermione, nudging Barty lightly in the side. He grinned at her, his canines a bit long and poking out between his lips.</p><p>Regulus stared, eyes lingering on the dark red blood around her chin and lower jaw. "Did you just <em>joke</em> about being tortured? Wizards have gone <em>insane</em> from its exposure, Hermione!"</p><p>"Eh." She shrugged one shoulder.</p><p>"<em>Hermione!"</em></p><p>She turned her head. "What do you want me to say, Reg? Yeah, it <em>sucked</em>. It <em>hurt</em>. It feels like thousands of burning hot knives are plunging into your body, all over, and you can't escape it. It's sensory overload."</p><p>Bile worked its way up Regulus's throat - again. Hermione had been tortured on and off for <em>hours</em>. She had barely been given time to rest between Voldemort's merciless spellcasting toward the end.</p><p>"They're going to want to do that again, aren't they," whispered Regulus in horror, saliva choking him.</p><p>"Probably, yeah."</p><p>Barty had his eyes open and was watching Hermione with a carefully blank look on his face, even as Regulus tipped forward and buried his face in his hands.</p><p>"Merlin, what are we going to do?" his voice shook. "I – I've only been here once before for Narcissa's wedding – maybe – maybe I remember the layout? If I see her – I can convince her to help us escape? She always liked me…"</p><p>"She won't go against her husband," pointed out Barty quietly, turning his eyes away from a very calm Hermione to watch Regulus as he began to panic.</p><p>Regulus's lips trembled. "What are we going to do?" He turned to Hermione. "Is Potter waiting for you? Please tell me you had plans, like, a day after returning home from Hogwarts."</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "James has Auror training all this week. Late evenings, so we made plans for a fortnight later."</p><p>Regulus moaned.</p><p>"What about the cellar itself?" Barty suggested, looking around. He squinted his eyes, like that would make it easier to see the darker recesses.</p><p>"It's enchanted," answered Hermione calmly. "The glass on the windows is spelled unbreakable. The gate is wand-signature activated. The stone is about a meter thick all around."</p><p>Regulus' mouth dropped open. "<em>How do you know all that–</em>"</p><p>"So, we're here until they let us out or you come up with a plan," summed Barty as he cut Regulus off, nodding decisively. He wriggled his rear a bit further down, so he was in a slouch and crossed his arms over his chest. "Good to know. I'm going to nap."</p><p>"Nap!? <em>Nap?!</em>" Regulus snapped, launching to his feet as he stared down at his two Ravenclaw friends. "How could you nap while we're stuck in a dungeon? You're going to just <em>wait</em> for them to come back and torture us?"</p><p>Barty yawned. "Got nothing else pressing, mate."</p><p>Regulus scowled, turning his eyes to Hermione. "Listen, I understand that you're a seer and know what's going to happen but for the rest of us clueless sods, Hermione, could you please–"</p><p>"A <em>seer</em>? Regulus - <em>what?</em>" Hermione turned her stare at Regulus, completely befuddled, just as Barty burst out laughing.</p><p>Regulus and Hermione turned stared at him, one in concern, the other in frustration as his laughs got louder and louder. Barty bent at the waist, tears streaming down his face, until, finally, he began to wheeze.</p><p>The other wizard turned away from Barty to stare at Hermione, also confused. "You're a seer, that's how you knew about the lake and the inferi, and the other–"</p><p>"Ugh." Hermione's nose wrinkled up in disgust. "Oh, God, no. No. A seer? <em>Divination?</em> That's just horrible. No. How dare you suggest a thing–"</p><p>Regulus blinked. "Then what–"</p><p>Barty, finally finished laughing, hiccupped, and gasped out, "She's from the future, you daft git. It's been obvious from the beginning."</p><p>There was a moment of breathless silence.</p><p><em>"WHAT?" </em>shouted Hermione, throwing herself back from Barty, eyes wide as she stared at him.</p><p>"<em>Ibegyourpardon</em>," squeaked out Regulus, quickly, all in one fast tumble.</p><p>Barty didn't look at either of them as he settled back against the wall.</p><p>Hermione continued to stare, even as Regulus sputtered out, "We met Hermione before the Sorting, Barty! Are you telling me an eleven-year-old travelled back in time from the future?"</p><p>"My family has <em>baby</em> <em>pictures</em> of me, Barty," added Hermione, her voice low and careful, despite her furiously beating heart. She hoped he couldn't hear it. "Both Lily and Petunia remember my mum being pregnant with me. I can't be a time traveller."</p><p>"Maybe not your body," he replied stubbornly, opening his eyes enough to squint at them both. "But your mind definitely travelled through time."</p><p>Both remained silent: Regulus due to his skepticism and Hermione due to her fear of her secret being exposed.</p><p>Barty sighed, turning to Hermione to address her. "Hermione. I love you. I really do. You're my best friend and if it wasn't for you…" he trailed off and shook his head. "Anyway. Let's be honest here: how could you have known <em>anything</em> that you have? How is it that you could do magic so well, right from the start, as a Muggleborn?"</p><p>Hermione bristled, and Barty saw.</p><p>"I'm not saying it like that," he sighed, rolling his eyes at her. "You know what I mean. Even if you were a magical prodigy, it still wouldn't explain away things."</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth to demand, <em>"like what?"</em> but Regulus interrupted her with a breathless, "You never got lost."</p><p>"What." Hermione turned her stare on him.</p><p>Regulus, however, was lost in his thoughts as things began to come to him from his memories, and he whispered, "You always knew where all our classes were."</p><p>"Mmhmm," added Barty, a knowing glint in his eyes and a tiny smirk on his thin lips.</p><p>"The homework was too easy," continued Regulus, grey eyes wide, "You always finished it well before us. You never had to look up reference books in the library. You'd help us in class and outside of it because you mastered the spell on the first go, <em>always</em>."</p><p>Hermione tightened her mouth into a long, flat line.</p><p>"You never got lost," echoed Barty, "To a classroom, a toilet, the library, or the kitchens. You knew where the trick stair was–"</p><p>"Lily could've told me that," interrupted Hermione sharply. "She was ahead of me at Hogwarts–"</p><p>"Sure," said Barty with a shrug, "But after you were sorted, you removed yourself from her almost immediately. You didn't want to have anything to do with Gryffindor. You were avoiding her."</p><p>"And others," added Regulus, a light going off in his eyes as he turned them to her. He was convinced, as things came to him and began to click into place. "You didn't just dislike people, for no reason - you already knew them. You wanted to avoid them!"</p><p>"Potter, Black, Lupin, Pettigrew," began Barty slowly, quietly, as his eyes held Hermione's. "Snape, Malfoy–"</p><p>"You skipped ahead in several classes," added Regulus, "Arithmancy–"</p><p>"It's just <em>maths</em>," muttered Hermione petulantly.</p><p>"Ancient Runes," added Barty.</p><p>"Children's minds are more malleable and can handle learning new languages–" argued Hermione.</p><p>"Charms," her fellow Ravenclaw added with a glint to his brown eyes.</p><p>"Hermione," breathed Regulus, grey eyes wide, "Hermione, just how <em>far</em> in the future are you from?"</p><p>Hermione stared at them both for a long moment before flatly declaring, in a very heavy accent, "This is bullshit. <em>Bullshit</em>!"</p><p>The look Regulus gave her tinged on the border of pity. "How else would you have known about the pieces, Hermione? You said you saw them fight back – you destroyed them once before. Fiendfyre or basilisk venom. Those are two extremely specific means to destroy Dark Magic."</p><p>"The Lake. The inferi," continued Barty, but this time, there was pity in <em>his</em> eyes. "The Room."</p><p>"Your understanding of magic, and your control over it," added Regulus. "Hermione – <em>transmutation</em>. That's just… it's not possible at our age. It's <em>not</em>."</p><p>"You're just not taken by magic," said Barty, matter-of-factly. "That's what you and Evans - Lily - fought about, remember? She accused you of not being taken in by the wonder of magic, as any Muggleborn would."</p><p>"Unless you already did it before," finished Regulus. "Unless you already saw and experienced it all before."</p><p>Hermione's heart thundered in her chest and somewhere, along the time of their observations tripping over themselves, she held her breath. Slowly, she exhaled, doing her best to appear unaffected by their accusations and – truthful – words.</p><p>Her brown eyes flickered between Regulus' grey and Barty's brown, glancing back and forth. There was conviction in them, a steady return of her gaze that read <em>We know the truth, don't deny us</em>.</p><p>For a moment, a breathless moment, Hermione considered <em>Obliviate</em>. She had done it before on her Granger-parents, and her fingers twitched with the desire to cast the spell on her friends to protect her interests. But then she deflated, visibly wilting, and slumping down where she sat on her knees, a few feet away from the two.</p><p>Barty and Regulus were her friends in the 1970s. Her Harry-and-Ron. Her other halves. They had decided to stand against Voldemort with her, because they believed in her – and, with a tiny snort – she realized now because Barty always knew and had faith that because she had done this before, she wouldn't steer him wrong.</p><p>To take their memories – no. She wouldn't betray them that way.</p><p>"I won't talk about this here," she muttered, finally looking at them both in the eye. It wasn't an admission to their words, but enough that she acknowledged them.</p><p>Barty nodded, but Regulus' mouth dropped open like he couldn't believe it was true, despite his own words backing Barty's claim.</p><p>"Okay," agreed Barty easily. "Later. Once we get out of here."</p><p>Hermione sighed. "Give me a minute."</p><p>"Wait, what–" Regulus' words were cut off as Hermione stood, stepping back to look at the grated window above them. "I thought you said that was enchanted? Unbreakable?"</p><p>"Sure," nodded Hermione, "The window is. But not the stone around it."</p><p>Regulus levelled a very flat stare at her. "You're kidding. Hermione, we're nearly two meters below ground."</p><p>"That's easy enough to work around, Reg," she replied, taking a few steps back to review the stone. She knew it was thick, but she could transmute that easily. It was just gathering her magic, considering the array she wanted to use and focus on in her mind and then the release.</p><p>Barty rose to his feet and Regulus steadied him. They turned to face the wall with Hermione.</p><p>She spread her legs a bit, widening her stance and closed her eyes, stretching her hands out in front of her despite not really needing gestures.</p><p>"I can't wait to get out of this place," Barty muttered.</p><p>"Would you care for one more to join you?"</p><p>Hermione would later deny it, but all three of the teenagers shrieked loudly and clutched at each other, spinning, and cuddling close in a huddle as they faced where the strange voice came from.</p><p>From a distant corner, a broad-shouldered, hunched-over wizard stepped toward them. His blond hair was dirty, smeared with mud, and there was an ever-present grimace of pain on his face – probably due to the vivid red burn that stretched along the left side of his face, into his hairline and down below the gap on his robes, showing a bit of his collarbone. His robes had seen better days, now torn and faded, and he slid forward with a pronounced limp.</p><p>"Who're you?" squeaked Regulus, fingers tightening on Hermione's arm as he did so. He cleared his throat and asked again, his voice deeper, "Who are you?"</p><p>"Caradoc Dearborn," the man replied, his voice rusty and rumbling.</p><p>Hermione inhaled sharply. She recognized the name as an Order member who went missing, never to be found – there was no body, just the knowledge that Voldemort killed him.</p><p>Barty stared as the three slowly loosened their grips on each other. "Were you there the whole time?"</p><p>"Yes," the man replied, hissing as the burn stretched. "But I only heard you when you spoke of escape."</p><p><em>The first or second time?</em> wondered Hermione. She turned her eyes to Regulus and Barty, raising her eyebrows in a silent question.</p><p>Regulus shrugged, but Barty scowled. "I think we should leave him," he said, not even bothering to lower his voice. "Who knows what he heard!"</p><p>"All the better to take him," argued Regulus quietly in a hiss. "If he stays, he could tell – <em>him</em>!"</p><p>The two boys turned to Hermione and she sighed.</p><p>"He comes," she declared as the deciding vote.</p><p>Barty hissed his displeasure, eyeing the man as he lumbered closer.</p><p>"Thank you," Dearborn said, quietly.</p><p>"Just – stay back. And be ready to run to the Apparation markers," said Hermione. She went to the same position, arms and hands spread, and ignored their slight tremble. Her eyes closed and she frowned, concentrating on the feel of her magic pooling within her, flowing down her arms and into her hands.</p><p>Then, she thought of what she wanted to happen, visualizing it in her mind. She made a rectangle with her thumb and forefinger of both hands, two upside-down Ls, and held it in front of her. She began building the array from that, murmuring under her breath as she did so.</p><p>In front, against the cool gray of the stone, a golden rectangular in the shape of a tall door appeared. Hermione's fingers began moving, tiny flicks and twists as two circles appeared inside the rectangle, forming an 8 but interlocked where they touched with smaller, geometric circles.</p><p>Inside each large circle was a diamond, points touching north, south, east, and west, and inside each of <em>those</em> diamonds were pentagrams. Runes for stability, strength, illusion, earth, and water appeared at different points in both pentagrams, a mix of languages ranging from the Phoenician that she argued with Rabastan over, to Futhark. She linked the runes through the pentagram to the directional points, and along the edge, there were astrological symbols.</p><p>And then she <em>pushed</em>.</p><p>The wall trembled and she distantly felt Regulus grab her shoulder to keep her upright. When she opened her eyes, the thick wall had split open, revealing nearly a meter of stone and then a very dark tunnel of shiny, dewy compact earth. The edges were glowing gold, but it was beginning to fade.</p><p>Barty stepped forward first, jerking his head at Dearborn to join him. He held a hand up and then snapped his fingers – a light appeared, a nonverbal and wandless <em>lumos</em> that bobbed and hovered near Barty.</p><p>"Let's go," he muttered, stepping first into the tunnel.</p><p>Regulus and Hermione were last. Hermione raised the earth and stone behind them, an invert of the original array appearing in the open space, only for the stone to waver back in place to hide their escape.</p><p>"We'll need to be quick," she instructed, gasping a little. The magic under Malfoy manor was slippery, like trying to hold onto water, and the magic fought her, despite its organic nature around them. "They'll have noticed what I did, and worse, I can't hold the magic as well as I can elsewhere. It's fighting me."</p><p>"Can a <em>homenum revelio </em>find us?" asked Regulus, grimly, as he helped guide Hermione behind Barty and Dearborn, their toes practically stepping on their heels.</p><p>She grimaced. "Maybe. I don't know."</p><p>"Then let's move," barked Barty, barely taking a moment to glance over his shoulder at Regulus and Hermione.</p><p>"What are you doing, by the way?" asked Dearborn curiously as he looked around the tunnel.</p><p>"Essentially, vanishing the dirt," replied Hermione with a grunt, eyes forward as she focused on the space in front of Barty. "And then bringing it back to cover our tracks behind us. But I had to punch my way through the rock first, by changing it from rock to earth so it would all vanish in one go."</p><p>Dearborn's gaze was sharp as he glanced back at her, but he kept silent other than a thoughtful "hmmm."</p><p>The four were silent, their entire bodies tense. Hermione felt sweat drip down her spine and pool at the waistband of her Hogwarts skirt. The scabs on her knees and shins were beginning to itch and the dried blood on her chin and throat made her skin feel tight.</p><p>"How far do we need to go?" asked Regulus, his voice hushed. There was no need to be quiet four meters below ground, but everyone kept silent.</p><p>Hermione bit her lip. "I'm not sure…"</p><p>"Then how do we know we're far enough through the property that we're near the ward lines?" asked Barty curiously. "I've never been here before."</p><p>Everyone turned to Regulus, who caught their looks, only to back up a few steps until he bumped into dirt. "Oh, no – don't look at me! I don't spend my time admiring the Malfoy's lawn, thank you. Have you seen the <em>peacocks</em>?"</p><p>Both Barty and Dearborn stared at Regulus, who blushed.</p><p>He muttered, "The Malfoys have something about peacocks. I'm not lying – you look at one of them funny and Abraxas or Colette will fuck you up."</p><p>"I… don't even know what to say to that," replied Hermione after a moment. She shook her head, swaying a little as vertigo hit her in the dark of the tunnel, and stepped up to stand next to Barty, wiping away sweat with one hand that beaded on her forehead. "We're going to have to decide when we've gone far enough."</p><p>"How far do you think we've gone?" he asked, glancing at her. He frowned. "Are you doing okay?"</p><p>"Yeah, why?"</p><p>Barty gestured with his free hand, the other still hoisting the glowing orb from his wandless <em>lumos</em>. "You… you're sweating. You were also just tortured for hours, Hermione, should you be doing this much magic—"</p><p>"I'm <em>fine</em>," grumbled Hermione, narrowing her eyes and then pointedly turning her head away from her friend to look forward. She moved both her hands and the dirt in front of them glowed for a moment and then vanished. Trying not to pant, she added, "See? Totally fine. I can do this."</p><p>"Uh-huh."</p><p>The two fell silent, Hermione constantly repeating the motion to vanish the dirt. Without their wands, they had to get as far away from the Manor as possible. They would not be able to fight their way out if they were swarmed, and if Voldemort decided to check in on them – and them without wands or luck – things could go poorly.</p><p>"We can't keep doing this," Barty suddenly announced, causing Regulus and Dearborn to make cries of surprise, even as he stopped walking and Hermione crashed into his back.</p><p>"What? Why?" asked Regulus, coming closer as he hovered by Barty's shoulder. Dearborn, beside him, was frowning, pulling at the burn on his face and twisting the skin grotesquely.</p><p>"Hermione can't keep this up." Barty nodded and her and she scowled back.</p><p>"Hermione bloody well can—" she began, even as Regulus leaned closer, into Barty's <em>lumos</em>, and swore.</p><p>"Bloody hell, Hermione, you're as pale as a ghost!"</p><p>Her scowl deepened. "And fuck you, too, Reg—"</p><p>"Is it the magic?"</p><p>Three heads turned to Dearborn, who cleared his throat. He scratched at his burn on his neck and then yanked his hand away. "The magic you're doing. And you said you were tortured before you were in the dungeons. Should you really be doing any more magic? You must be tiring yourself out."</p><p>"I'll keep doing it if it means we get out of here alive," snapped Hermione, eyes narrowed. "We have no choice—"</p><p>"There's always a choice," Dearborn said quietly, the surety in his voice reminding the three teenagers of their age difference. "It just might not be one we want to make."</p><p>The new Hogwarts graduates were silent, and Barty's glowing orb flickered a bit. He glanced up at it and then at Hermione, waiting to see what she wanted to do.</p><p>"We can't stay down here forever," agreed Regulus, a bit tactfully. "We're going to have to head to the surface soon."</p><p>"There could be Death Eaters there," pointed out Barty, as Hermione refused to speak. Instead, she leaned against the nearest earthen wall, cool and thick and solid against her shoulder. <em>Nothing wrong with a little break</em>, she reasoned.</p><p>"We're in the middle of a war," pointed out Dearborn tartly, "There's always going to be Death Eaters."</p><p>"So – what? We jump out and make a run for it?" asked Barty with a heavy frown.</p><p>Regulus's face was pinched. "I don't like it. I don't like our chances."</p><p>"It's the best we've got," argued Dearborn. "We can't sit here forever – the air will go toxic. And if they get smart and <em>homenum revelio</em> works, they can just use bludgeoning spells on the ground until they get us, and then we're dead."</p><p>"Charming," muttered Hermione, with a sigh. "Alright. I'll take us up. And we'll all hope that we're close to the property line. If not, we <em>run</em>."</p><p>Hermione rolled her neck, hearing the cracks and pops, and knew that her shoulders were up closer to her ears from tension than where they should be, making her arms stiff and ache. Despite that, she took a deep breath. Her breathing evened out and the dizziness that she had been fighting eased, giving her time to focus on transmuting the dirt before them into solid stone.</p><p>Runes and etchings in glowing gold spread across the dirt and then inward as first dirt steps appeared; then, the gold fizzled and sparked, and the dirt was stone, disappearing into an earthen ceiling.</p><p>Regulus pursed his lips. "Do we need to dig our way out?"</p><p>Hermione sent him a scathing glare. "I'll vanish the dirt when we're ready."</p><p>Barty's Adam's apple bobbed in his throat, and he moved to be the first out – but Dearborn put a hand on his shoulder and gently pushed him back. "I'll go first, Crouch."</p><p>No one opposed it, leaving Hermione at the back with Barty and Regulus between her and Dearborn. Dearborn himself crouched and got as far as he could up the steps, head brushing against the dirt and leaving chunks of it falling onto the crown of his head and shoulders.</p><p>"Ready?" Hermione glanced around at everyone. When only silent, pale faces looked back at her, she sighed, and flicked her hands at the earth ceiling, thinking <em>bombarda</em>.</p><p>The dirt exploded outward, sending chunks of grass and rock in all directions – and telling everyone where they were – as much as a <em>lumos maxima</em> could have caused. Dearborn was up and out of the hole first, standing guard and point as Barty and Regulus emerged.</p><p>Hermione, last up, collapsed the dirt into the hole, leaving the ground displaced and churned up from the uneven fill. It was clear that they had been underground, and they had tunneled – even if the Death Eaters would never figure out how.</p><p>"We're about two hundred yards from the property line," announced Dearborn grimly.</p><p>"That's doable," argued Barty quietly, eyes darting around, and then focusing on the far line of the property, where a low, thick rock wall demarked the wards.</p><p>Dusk was settling in and the sun was hovering just above the treeline of the forest around them, skimming the tops and sending lengthy, thin shadows across the manicured grounds. The white peacocks were grazing, shining beacons in the growing darkness and a few were crying out, their warbling trills echoing. One or two sat in the trees on the property, but most were grazing around the well-trimmed hedges and topiary hedges in the shape of other exotic animals, pecking at the ground. Other than the few peacock cries, it was eerily silent.</p><p>"You can run it in less than five minutes," agreed Dearborn dryly, "But when you're under fire and fighting for your life?"</p><p>"No one's here yet," protested Barty.</p><p>"Spoke too soon," muttered Regulus, facing back toward the Manor.</p><p>"What—?"</p><p>Lights were popping on in the windows as room after room was being searched. The four could hear the faintest of cries as the main doors were flung open.</p><p>"Run," muttered Hermione through suddenly bloodless lips. "<em>Run</em>!"</p><p>The four turned and made a dash across the grass.</p><p>Hermione's heart thundered in her chest and she was panting almost immediately. Her body had been abused the entire day, from her torture to using so much magic for their escape. She just wanted to lay down and <em>sleep</em>. She tripped over her feet and then Barty was at her side, teeth bared as he gripped her arm and yanked her up. He then propelled her forward, shoving at her and remaining at her back in case she tripped again.</p><p>"Shit!" Dearborn skidded to a halt, and Hermione nearly hit his back, Barty only able to yank her back in time.</p><p>They had crossed half of the distance, one hundred yards, and on the other side of the ward wall, several masked Death Eaters appeared, their smoky Apparation blending into the twilight and thick, dark forest behind them. Two climbed over the stone, visibly shuddering as they moved through the wards. The other three followed, a barrier between the four and freedom.</p><p>Shouts from behind had Hermione and Barty turn, pressing back-to-back with Dearborn and Regulus. A dozen Death Eaters were forming a line toward them in a pincer move, hoping the squeeze between them, their prey in Hermione, and the others.</p><p>As the sun sunk behind the trees, turning the sky red and deep purple, Hermione slashed her hand diagonally across the approaching Death Eaters. Her knees trembled and she barely managed to keep herself upright as the ground beneath them began to rumble.</p><p>"What the—"</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>Alarm coloured the Death Eaters in front of them, and then the ground crumbled. It split into a wide chasm, a gaping maw in the ground over two meters wide and stretched from a smooth flagstone path to a pond water feature, which cracked and bubbled over and then down into the hole, sending golden orange goldfish the size of her forearm flopping over the rim.</p><p>One Death Eater shrieked as they fell into the trench. Hermione stomped her foot and twisted just so, imagining the bottom of the trench in her mind. Golden sparks sizzled and hissed as the trench glowed from below, and another's screams were abruptly cut off as they realized at the bottom of the trench, Hermione had transmuted metal spikes from the goldfish.</p><p>A few managed to leap back in time – one losing their mask, that let their white-blond hair shine in the dark.</p><p>"Oh, little coz," taunted a feminine voice from behind Hermione, pitched high. "You didn't think you'd get away, did you?"</p><p>"Kind of, yeah," muttered Regulus under his breath.</p><p>Hermione did not turn her head around to see what Regulus and Dearborn were facing, but she felt Regulus dive to the side and Dearborn move the other way, so she dragged Barty to the grass, breaking the scabs on her knees as she did so.</p><p>A sizzling orange spell sailed over them and the Death Eaters by the trench – who didn't fall in – scrambled out of the way of the spell as well. It hit one of the well-maintained hedges on the property, one shaped like an elephant, only for the leaves to shrivel and the entire plant to wilt, and then crumble to dust.</p><p>Lucius Malfoy, without his mask, moaned. "The <em>hedges</em>…"</p><p>It seemed that was the cue for the Death Eaters to engage because immediately a barrage of spellfire was sent toward them. Hermione split from Barty, rolling, and hurtling toward the trench and grabbing at the metal spikes from the ground and summoning them straight up in the air.</p><p>Four blocked incoming spells, reverberating loudly with a <em>clang</em> that sounded more like a deep gong.</p><p>Barty had not been idle, and instead used Hermione's cover to dash across the ground and met two Death Eaters who jumped across the trench, using their magic to aid them. He slugged one in the face, using his momentum to do so, and their mask went crooked, revealing Corban Yaxley's startled face.</p><p>Yaxley yelped, and Barty continued past him, tripping over his feet and wheeling his arms as he fell into the other Death Eater, who shoved him away physically and then brought their wand up to curse at Barty.</p><p>Hermione snarled, but Barty was prepared: he allowed himself to fall to his knees and then kicked out with his foot, connecting with the Death Eater's knees and sending them sprawling on their back – completely unused to physical, Muggle brawling. Barty climbed on top and swung his fists down but was blasted off after only hitting the Death Eater twice – Yaxley had his wand out and aimed at him.</p><p>Turning, Barty flung dirt at Yaxley, whose mask was hanging half-off his face. Hermione reached out and caught the dirt with her magic, transfiguring the grains into shards of glass even as Barty piggybacked onto her magic and banished the pieces at the man standing above him.</p><p>The shards pricked at Yaxley, bright lines of blood appearing on his cheeks, hands, and throat – or anywhere exposed – and the man shouted, dropping his wand.</p><p>Barty dove and caught it, and then swung up in the next move with the tip a deep green as he slashed toward the other Death Eater, causing him to bring his own wand up defensively.</p><p>Behind them, a Death Eater was helpfully levitating a fellow wizard over the trench. Hermione smirked, transfiguring the remaining metal spikes into silver cobras that slithered their way toward the Death Eater on the ground, only for them to rear up and strike with their pointy fangs, biting down onto the man's wrists. He jerked his hand back and the Death Eater he was levitating fell into the trench, screaming – which stopped with a sickening crack and thud.</p><p>With Barty now engaged in the Death Eater with a wand – the only one to have one – Hermione turned her defensive attentions to Regulus and Dearborn behind her. Dearborn was dodging spells from two wizards who were tag-teaming him, one being Lucius although the wizard was clearly not focused on the fight, his eyes constantly darting around and flinching every time someone set a hedge on fire or a peacock shrieked in alarm.</p><p><em>That's an idea</em>, thought Hermione, glancing around and summoning the nearest peacock to her with a wandless <em>accio</em>. The albino peacock shrieked and flapped its large wings, its tail feathers fanning out threateningly as it soared through the air.</p><p>She caught the bird and hugged it tight around her middle, smoothing her hands down the feathers as the bird slowly altered from fowl to swine. The peacocks were already large, but the animal transfiguration was only on the species and not the size, resulting in a rather large boar with threatening tusks when Hermione was done.</p><p>She fell to her knees, exhausted, and watched as the peacock-pig grunted its annoyance and squealed, rushing off and away from her as quickly as it could and toward Malfoy and the wizard he was fighting with.</p><p>Malfoy glanced toward her and did a doubletake, crying out, "No! Not the peacocks! <em>Mother is going to kill me!</em>" but then realized what she had done, and paled.</p><p>The boar reached Malfoy, who began sending sparks at it, trying to deter it without hurting something his mother clearly loved even if it was in a different form. But the wizard was dancing around, being pushed further and further from the other Death Eater.</p><p>The Death Eater he was fighting alongside, on the blind side, didn't see the boar or realize the Malfoy was being herded away. Instead, he made a jerk with his wand and shouted, "<em>Levicorpus</em>!"</p><p>Dearborn was yanked up into the air by his ankle, and Hermione saw red, rising to her feet.</p><p>"<em>SNAPE!"</em> she screamed, causing the Death Eater to jerk back, his head twisting toward her in a whip-like manner. Dearborn fell to the ground, on his burned side, causing him to grunt and moan out in pain.</p><p>A shaking hand pushed their mask off their face, revealing Snape's long face and hooked nose, as well as wide, dark eyes. "<em>Hermione</em>?"</p><p>"You fucking prick!" shouted Hermione, planting herself before Dearborn. "How could you? I thought you and Lily were <em>friends</em> again! And this is what you do – how you repay her?"</p><p>Snape, already pale, went bone white. "Hermione – I – what are you –" He shook his head, blinking away his thoughts. His face hardened. "<em>You're</em> the prisoner? I – I can't let you go—"</p><p>"<em>Let?</em>" snarled Hermione. "Who said anything about you <em>letting </em>me do anything, you bastard?"</p><p>Hermione's anger took over, and she half-snarled, half-though <em>Ignis Graecus</em> as she clenched a fist in front of her, the bottom hem of Snape's robes catching on fire.</p><p>Snape's face hardened further at the same time, and his mouth moved, a familiar spell on his lips. "<em>Sectumsem</em>—"</p><p>But the spark was bright against the darkness that was swiftly covering the Malfoy grounds, and the smell stopped Snape first. He glanced down, swearing and turning his wand from Hermione to put out the fire.</p><p>Except, each time he tried to turn <em>aguamenti</em> on it, the flames grew. He shrieked, yanking off his robes and flinging them off, batting them against the ground and revealing a worn shirt and trousers – he had learned from his O.W.L. year, and there was something viciously pleasing in lighting Snape on fire – again – for Hermione.</p><p>Distracted from her, Hermione turned and hauled Dearborn to his feet.</p><p>"Thanks," he grunted, and they hobbled quickly toward Barty. He had a <em>protego</em> up with Yaxley's wand, protecting them in the bubble as he backed up toward them. All three now moving toward Regulus, who was the closest to the stone wall, but was also fighting Bellatrix, who wore no mask.</p><p>Despite being proficient in wandless magic, or what Hermione had taught him and Barty, there was little any wizard could do in a fight using it as they were so used to using a <em>foci</em> such as their wands.</p><p>But somehow Regulus had thought of that – and was using a tiny, sharp thread he had likely picked up from the Haberdashery. He had the thread wound around his hands with a long, trailing bit between them that he held up and out, infusing it with his magic as he nonverbally cast and channeled his magic through the thread, turning it into a makeshift shield against Bellatrix's attacks.</p><p>Each time the thread snapped, he discarded the bits in the grass and unwound more, beginning the cycle again. Bellatrix was becoming frustrated, shrieking in rage as her spells became darker, sharper, quicker, but also flying off target often.</p><p>Finally, Regulus lashed out with his thread, his wandless magic changing the thin thread to something thicker, firmer, and it became a whip, latching around Bellatrix's wand hand. Bellatrix's beautiful face twisted into something ugly as she clenched her hand tight around her wand and yanked her hand toward her, pulling and testing on the string that tied her to her younger cousin.</p><p>"Do you honestly think this will hold <em>me</em>, Reggie?" she sneered, eyes flashing dangerously. "I am better than you, stronger than you, in all the ways necessary—"</p><p>"This was never meant to <em>hold</em> you, Bella," commented Regulus, his voice tight as his fist closed around the thread. "But meant to connect us."</p><p>Bellatrix's eyes narrowed.</p><p>"<em>Fulgur</em> <em>virga</em>!" shouted Regulus, gritting his teeth as bright, white lightning crackled around his fist and then raced down the thread connecting the two Blacks.</p><p>On the other end of the thread, Bellatrix's eyes widened and she desperately, instinctively pulled her hand with her wand, trying to cast and turn it to create a shield, but it was stuck pointing up to the sky. Her panic overtook her common sense and the delay cost her as the lightning struck.</p><p>She shrieked – her voice high and loud in the night and causing the other peacocks to take up equally loud cries – and the smell of burning flesh wafted toward them. Her hand turned black, and her entire body shook with the aftereffects of the electricity coursing through her. She collapsed to the ground.</p><p>Regulus was breathing heavily when the lightning finally sizzled away, partially bending as he sucked in heavy breaths from the wandless spell he cast. The hand that was holding the thread and connecting the two cousins was blistered and red, and he carefully cradled it in his other hand, trying to stop the shaking.</p><p>"Let's get out of here," muttered Regulus, glancing at Barty, Dearborn, and Hermione. "I'm so done with today."</p><p>Barty's laugh was brittle. "Aren't we all?"</p><p>Dearborn and Hermione, still supporting each other, took a few steps forward and toward the stone wall. Barty was behind them, and Regulus leading the way with determined steps. They were only a few meters away when a familiar chilling voice caused them to halt.</p><p>"Leaving so soon?"</p><p>Dearborn let his arm drop from around Hermione's shoulders as they all turned, wearily, to face Voldemort.</p><p>The four stood in a line, pressed shoulder-to-shoulder. They were a grim picture: bloodied, dirty – both Dearborn and Regulus were burned and she and Barty were covered in scrapes and bruises. Hermione didn't even want to think how badly her hair looked, humidity causing it to poof out, partially singed unevenly in places.</p><p>Death Eaters stood silently behind the tall Dark Lord; Yaxley had removed his mask entirely, a mulish scowl on his face as Barty taunted him by doing a stupid, elaborate flourish with the stolen wand, and then pointing it at Voldemort.</p><p>Voldemort just eyed it, and then at Barty, and then at the ragtag band of them, a dismissive look on his face. "I certainly hope more than one of you has a wand. If not, then my Death Eaters are in dire need of correction."</p><p>A few shuffled nervously at that, a brief look of fear crossing even Lucius's face.</p><p>"I guess we're just that good," taunted Regulus with a proud tilt to his chin, looking so much like Sirius that Hermione felt her breath catch.</p><p>"Such a shame," murmured Voldemort, red eyes travelling from Regulus to Barty and to Hermione. His mouth turned down in displeasure at Dearborn. "I see you picked up a stray. Another little bird trying to flee."</p><p>Dearborn's eyes narrowed.</p><p>"Well, this was a distracting amusement, if anything," continued Voldemort blithely, "But all things must end—"</p><p><em>Except you, of course,</em> thought Hermione rudely.</p><p>"—and your time has come," he finished, drawing his yew wand. It practically glowed in the darkness of the evening, the sun long gone and behind the trees, and the sky more purple and a deep navy blue speckled with stars.</p><p>A peacock cried, somewhere on the grounds.</p><p>"Who shall face me first?" Voldemort asked.</p><p>The four were silent, and then Regulus muttered, apologetically, "I gave it all I had with Bella. I'm done without a wand."</p><p>"I don't have your wandless abilities," said Dearborn, shaking his head.</p><p>Barty and Hermione shared a glance, more like a grimace, and then stepped forward together, Barty with his stolen wand in front of them protectively, just a smidge ahead of Hermione.</p><p>Voldemort seemed amused. "The halfbreed with a wand and the Mudblood without anything?"</p><p>"Don't hold back, Hermione," murmured Barty, eyes bright as he focused on Voldemort completely. "Let's show these bastards what we're capable of. Let's let them know just who the <em>fuck</em> they're dealing with."</p><p>Hermione felt a grin stretch her face, pulling at hard, dried blood around her chin. She must have looked deranged, she thought, but she nodded and spread her legs, sliding one out and back along the grass and then arranged her hands in front of her, in fists, and then braced ready.</p><p>Voldemort laughed, a high sound that made Hermione wince. "What are you going to do, girl? Fight like the Muggle you are?"</p><p>Hermione just narrowed her eyes.</p><p>"Remember," whispered Dearborn behind them, "We want to give ground and get to the wardline behind us. Let them press forward."</p><p>"Got it," muttered Barty.</p><p>The silence between them was all-consuming, a terse showdown as neither side said nor did anything, until Barty jabbed his wand forward, sending <em>bombarda</em> nonverbally at Voldemort's feet, making the Dark Lord – amusingly – hop to avoid it.</p><p>Hermione laughed, loudly. Barty unleashed a variety of spells, all aimed at the Dark Lord's feet or the ground, sending dirt up in the sky, or changing the dirt to mud in hopes to sink the wizard.</p><p>Voldemort's thin lips pulled back into a snarl at the insult of being treated like a plaything, and he slashed his wand at Barty, causing the younger wizard to backpedal and hastily summon a nearby hedge to block the spell. The two collided and it sent leaves fluttering into the air.</p><p>Lucius Malfoy vaguely moaned in despair.</p><p>But the Dark Lord wasn't idle, sending a snap-like motion at the two along with a dark, heavy, and inky spell that cut through the air toward them. Barty yelped, but Hermione dove in front of him, calling up transmutation arrays. The snapped into place, golden circles the size of dinner plates on the back of her forearms.</p><p>The spell hit the circle with the force of a sledgehammer, shaking Hermione's arm and making her gasp. She gritted her teeth as her arm tingled from the magic, but Voldemort's spell dissipated, and her array held.</p><p>She lowered her arm, the circles disappearing in golden sparks as she did so.</p><p>Voldemort's eyes were wide, greedy. He murmured, "What magic was <em>that</em>?" but he didn't want an answer from her anyway, sending another spell – a low-level fifth year spell by the looks of it – at her. Hermione's arms came up, ready, and the arrays snapped back into place, with runes of strength, protection, placed within a smaller circle.</p><p>His red eyes gleamed, and another spent was sent at Hermione – now a seventh-year spell, and then he upgraded it, lobbying spell after spell at her. Hermione had to alternate between her arms, sometimes ducking and lengthening her body to ensure the spell hit on the circles and not Barty, or, somewhere on her body.</p><p>With each catch of the spell, she stepped back, Barty protectively at her heels until they were near Regulus and Dearborn. One of Voldemort's spells bounced off the shield, causing the array to dangerously flash, the light blinding Hermione momentarily. She glanced back over her shoulder at Regulus and Dearborn and cried, "What are you waiting for? Go!"</p><p>They turned and ran, Barty a few steps behind them. Hermione turned back to Voldemort and went on offense.</p><p>She let her right hand swing out, letting the magical circle disappear, its sparks floating up like a bonfire's embers; then, as her flat hand came parallel to the ground, she felt the humidity in the air, and pulled at the water, calling it to her in a more solid state.</p><p>The water swirled around her arm, flashing between a bright blue and white, with runes that ran up and down the whip-like coil, and Hermione make a sweeping gesture across her body, the coiled water following as it snapped out at the Dark Lord.</p><p>He blocked the whip with a wall of fire, a semi-circle bursting from the ground at his feet to chest-height. The wall twisted and turned into fiendfyre, turning from warm orange to chilling green in an instant as monstrous creatures of sphinxes, gryphons, and basilisks raced toward her.</p><p>Hermione swore under her breath, flinging herself back and transmuting the air again at the same time, both her hands sweeping up to mimic the rise of <em>her </em>wall of fire, hot orange and yellow.</p><p>The two flames crashed into one another with a roar, sending dark grey plumes of smoke high into the sky as the flames licked and raced along the smokestack, up higher and higher until they obscured the stars, a twisting dual coil of green and orange, of white and yellow.</p><p>The air was hazy and shimmered with the heat of the two spells and it was hard to breathe with the heat, smoke, and humidity in the air mingling with both Voldemort and Hermione's magic. She inhaled and coughed, tears stinging her eyes.</p><p>The flames fed off one another, Voldemort's fiendfyre creatures trying to push their way through the thick, transmuted flames of Hermione's – but while Voldemort's fire was conjured and summoned, hers was made from the water molecules in the air around them: each time his flame creatures tried to break through, Hermione was able to instinctively strengthen the weak area.</p><p>But there was only so much she could do as the Dark Lord's magic and will bore down on her flames, and Hermione found herself giving ground: her feet slid across the damp grass, or she had to step back and brace herself until she found herself pushed against the low stone wall that marked the ward line.</p><p>"Hermione, let's go! C'mon, end it!" shouted Barty, from the other side of the ward, beckoning her with a wave of his hand. His eyes were wide and wild, bouncing between her and the giant wall of flames that inched closer and closer to her.</p><p>She glanced back, her hair wild and bouncing around. The heat from the flames whisked away any sweat she had, drying her face, and turning her cheeks pink. She couldn't stay much longer, and with a quick nibble on her lower lip, Hermione peered through the thick flames and smoke, barely making out the Dark Lord as he confidently strode toward her.</p><p><em>Enough,</em> she thought, and then, crossing her arms in front of her, she brought both arms down in a violent motion, sending her orange and yellow flames tumbling down and around the green fiendfyre, smothering it briefly and sending up white billows of smoke that obscured the Malfoy grounds.</p><p>She turned and leaped over the ward stones, landing hard on the other side, gasping for air. She stumbled into a nearby tree, dizzy, but then pushed off it and stumbled toward Dearborn and Regulus. Barty kept his stolen wand up to protect her back, lips pulled back in a snarl.</p><p>"That was amazing!" crowed Regulus, wonder in his eyes. "Holy shite, Hermione!"</p><p>"We're not safe yet," cautioned Dearborn, making the two turn back behind them: Voldemort had pulled back on his fiendfyre and cut through the smoke, parting it like Moses did the Red Sea, and banishing the clouds in opposite directions down the grounds.</p><p>His red eyes were alight with wonder and greed aimed at Hermione, but also anger at them escaping him; he snarled something on the other side of the ward line, but they couldn't hear him. His Death Eaters, however, began to move and converge around him and toward the stone ward wall.</p><p>"I don't think I could do that again," gasped Hermione, clutching at Regulus's arm as the forest swam in front of her.</p><p>"Then – we need to run!"</p><p>But, then, suddenly, there was a loud <em>crack</em>.</p><p>Then another, and another, and four more.</p><p>In front of them, appearing in the spaces between the forest trees, Aurors in their brilliant, bright red jackets popped into existence in the darkness, some tossing up hovering balls of light while others were already shooting off spells at the Death Eaters emerging over the ward line. Some Aurors were on their knees and others standing behind them as defense, knocking back retaliations with <em>protego maxima</em> and summoning heavy bronze shields, looking like ancient Roman warriors.</p><p>Hermione, Regulus, Barty, and Dearborn all glanced at each other and then <em>ran</em> toward the Aurors. Regulus was the first to make it past the line of Aurors, sinking to his knees, with Barty and Dearborn next. Dearborn leaned heavily against a large tree trunk, gasping for air. Hermione let a burly Auror be her cover, stopping next to Barty with a skid and cartwheeling of her arms, just as a woman in lime green came up to them, hands raised in peace.</p><p>"I'm from St. Mungo's," she began, her eyes clinically running over them, still in their very dirty Hogwarts uniforms, "On attaché with the Aurors. You all seem like you need some rest and to be looked over."</p><p>"That would be nice," gasped out Regulus, slowly getting to his feet as he hugged his hand to his chest.</p><p>"Hermione was tortured with the cruciatus," agreed Barty, nodding at her. "I was kicked around but I think I had it the easiest out of everyone."</p><p>The woman's lips pursed, and she nodded. "Right. The Portkey won't be enjoyable, but it'll take you straight to Janus Thickey."</p><p>All Hermione wanted to do was crash and then sleep for a year. Even in the heydays of the Second Wizarding War, she had never used as much magic as she had this evening, and it was <em>exhausting</em>.</p><p>Barty's hand was warm as he slipped an arm around her back to hold her up; her entire form was trembling. Regulus took to her other side, bracketing her between her two best friends, her two boys who had stood up to Voldemort, to his Death Eaters, and <em>won</em> – bruised and battered, but they won.</p><p>She sent a tumultuous smile at first Regulus, and then Barty. Both wearily returned it: Regulus's hair was sweat-dampened and he smelled vaguely of his old sick, his Hogwarts robes torn beyond repair and his button-up stained something awful; Barty, his hair no longer straw-coloured but mixed with bloody red and brown dirt, with a bruise on the side of his face swelling up and split lip.</p><p>"On three," the Healer said, counting down. "One… two…"</p><p>And then the three were whisked away, in a swirl of colour, to St. Mungo's.</p><hr /><p>One was <em>not</em> picked up by Aurors, though, or taken to St. Mungo's. Instead, they slipped off during the confusion and noise, disappearing with a <em>crack</em> of Apparation that was hidden in the general bustle.</p><p>They reappeared far away, staggering a bit from malnutrition and general weariness, before righting themselves. They had appeared at the edge of a grove of trees, overrun with vegetation to hide their arrival. Beyond the trees was a dirt road, with wildflowers growing in clumps. Birdsong and the soft hum of insects turned the location idyllic, and to complete the picture as they stepped onto the road, there was a stone cottage on the opposite side.</p><p>The person moved slowly toward the cottage, hissing a bit in pain. At the wooden gate, set between two low stone walls, they leaned against one for a moment to catch their breath. The door of the cottage opened.</p><p>"I feared you were dead," the man in the doorway said, quietly, backlit by flickering candles from their entryway.</p><p>"Takes more than a few Death Eaters to kill me," the person replied with a grimace. "But I could use a pick-me-up."</p><p>"Your favourite?"</p><p>"Odgen's, twenty-four. The best year."</p><p>"Come in then," the man instructed, stepping back as the man confirmed his identity, and letting the other walk toward the cottage on his own.</p><p>Once inside, their eyes swept the cluttered living area, filled with books, scrolls, and lazily spinning objects of strange import.</p><p>The man pointed at a comfy armchair and they sank gratefully into it with a long sigh. A teapot and teacups materialized and hovered in the air between the two as the other man sank into an armchair opposite.</p><p>"Shall I get burn paste for you?" the man asked, as the teapot tipped and poured the perfect amount of tea into a cup.</p><p>The person glanced at the teacup, and then at the man, raising their eyebrows. With a hint of a smile, the man snapped his fingers and a bottle with swishing amber liquid appeared on the coffee table between the two.</p><p>"Or, perhaps, it <em>truly </em>is Odgen's that you are after," the man continued, his blue eyes twinkling.</p><p>The other person snorted. "You would want it, too, if you were a guest of <em>his</em> for almost a year."</p><p>They tapped the side of their teacup with a finger, and it enlarged to more of a mug or small bowl, and then they generously poured the whisky into their new drink. When they picked it up, their hands were shaking the tiniest amount. Both politely ignored that.</p><p>The other man also picked up his teacup and sipped at it.</p><p>Finally, after the warmth of the drink settled in their stomach, they said, quietly, "You were right."</p><p>"About what?"</p><p>"The girl. The Evans girl. She's the one," Caradoc Dearborn said, peering at Dumbledore from under a heavy brow.</p><p>Dumbledore's bushy eyebrows also rose.</p><p>Dearborn sighed. "She's the one the prophecy spoke about."</p><p>With a heavy heart, Dumbledore put down his teacup.</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC…</p>

  <strong>July 1979</strong>
</p><p>Sirius groaned as he popped his back, the beginnings of dark circles under his eyes and he shrugged off his Auror jacket and unceremoniously threw it into his locker. "I'm going to be <em>so glad</em> when we're no longer on night shifts. I know nothing exciting happens in Knockturn, but I would happily never see a hag again in my life."</p><p>"You and me, both," muttered James, wearily collapsing onto a bench between the two aisles of lockers below the Auror training pit in just his trousers, socks, and shoes. Not full-fledged Aurors yet, neither had an office in the Department and were relegated to the underbelly of the Ministry instead until they moved from trainees to cadets and then junior Aurors. As such, after a grueling twelve-hour shift overnight, Sirius and James were ready to go home.</p><p>James rubbed at his wet hair with a generic towel, body weary, and ready to Apparate to Potter Peak and sleep for <em>days</em>. The warm shower he had taken had not woken him up much or eased his aching muscles.</p><p>"You're just missing your bird," teased Sirius.</p><p>James rolled his eyes. "Don't be jealous 'cuz you don't have anyone."</p><p>"Why settle for one when you can have dozens?" leered Sirius, and James laughed, throwing a towel at him, which he dodged. They were silent, ambient noises of other Auror trainees in different parts of the locker room carrying through the industrial space.</p><p>Then, Sirius asked, "Why didn't you ask for time off to pick up Princess when the train came in yesterday? She just graduated."</p><p>"One; don't call my girlfriend that, it's weird," said James pointedly, "And two, she knows my schedule. She didn't want to be a bother and suggested we meet up when I was done with the night shifts so we could actually spend time together."</p><p>Sirius snorted. "That girl is <em>too</em> interested in not generating chaos. How did you two get together, again?"</p><p>James rubbed at his eyes, sighing, dislodging his glasses. <em>Sometimes I wonder, too, but then…</em> his thoughts trailed off and a lopsided grin settled on his face as he closed his eyes and remembered his birthday. With his eyes closed, he didn't see the man who entered the pit, but he felt Sirius stiffen.</p><p>Looking up, he saw Rufus Scrimgeour, lips pursed, and eyes fixed on his friend. Slowly, James rose to his feet.</p><p>"Black," the Auror barked, and then tried again, "Sirius. Head Auror Crouch is requesting you join him at St. Mungo's immediately."</p><p>Sirius reached back into his locker for his jacket, face turned away as he asked, "Does he needs me to record a witness statement—?"</p><p>"Sirius, you're not going as an Auror trainee," interrupted Scrimgeour quietly.</p><p>Sirius stilled and James glanced sharply at him.</p><p>"Your brother was admitted early this morning."</p><p>Sirius whirled around and James tensed. Where Regulus was, so was Hermione, and Crouch. Had something happened to them at Hogwarts? At King's Cross? No – it would've been that morning. Had they gone and done something – something like them that was secretive, and he had no idea, and he was spiralling, waiting to hear what Scrimgeour would say—</p><p>Scrimgeour continued, his voice as soft as he could make it (which was gruff), "Regulus was abducted from the train, along with two of his friends. They were held overnight and tortured by Death Eaters and barely escaped. They're in St. Mungo's, being treated. The Head Auror's son is with him—"</p><p>He didn't get to finish as both James and Sirius took off down the aisle and out of the pit, racing toward the Ministry Apparation point to get to St. Mungo's as quickly as possible.</p><hr /><p>Hermione must have passed out during the Portkey trip, because when she woke up, she was lying on a cot with a truly hideous lime green sheet pulled to her collarbone, Regulus on the bed next to her, and Barty at the end of her bed, scraping the bottom and sides of a chocolate pudding cup with relish.</p><p>Given that he was on <em>her</em> bed, Hermione deduced he was eating <em>her</em> food, and appropriately sent him a glare as she shuffled up into a sitting position. "Is that mine?"</p><p>"Not anymore," he replied between licks of his spoon, eyes closing in happiness.</p><p>"Prat," she muttered, instead turning to Regulus to ask, "How long was I out?"</p><p>"Barely forty minutes," answered Regulus solemnly. He was pale, but his Hogwarts uniform was missing, leaving him in a borrowed Healer's tunic; his face and hair were clean, too, but his right hand was bandaged. "It was long enough for them to dose you with potions for the cruciatus, but you're on a drip."</p><p>Hermione glanced up and to her left, seeing the hooked upside-down vial, its interior filled with tiny, pink swirls, and the line that connected the vial's stopper to the needle in her arm. She wrinkled her nose. "How long—?"</p><p>"Until it ends," said Barty, drawing one leg up under him, with the other on the floor. His hair had been washed, too, free of the blood and dirt. He looked remarkably calm.</p><p>"What happened?" muttered Hermione, looking around the empty ward they were in. While there were at least ten beds on either side of the walls, theirs were the only three occupied, and Barty had clearly abandoned his on Hermione's other side, nearest to the door, given the rumpled bedsheets.</p><p>"Private ward," explained Regulus, catching Hermione's thoughts. "They took one look at Barty and me, realized who we are, and then cleared this room out for us."</p><p>Hermione made a face, and Regulus sighed.</p><p>"Just wait for it," he muttered. "My parents and Barty's were owled. They weren't sure what to do with you, given your parents are Muggles. We didn't want to mention the Potters in case you and Potter were keeping things quiet."</p><p>With her own sigh, Hermione tried to bring a hand up to run through her hair, nervously – almost grimacing at the thought of picking up James's bad habits – but saw the dripline and reluctantly put her arm back on the lime green sheets.</p><p>"This is going to be a shitshow, isn't it?" she murmured, eyes turning the ceiling.</p><p>"When everyone arrives?" Barty nodded. "Oh, yeah."</p><p>"Do you think we'll still be able to escape to the Haberdashery?" asked Regulus, picking at his bedsheets.</p><p>"We're going to have to." Hermione glanced at Regulus. "I owe you and Barty a story, I think."</p><p>Barty snorted. "Well, you owe Regulus a story. <em>I</em> figured it out ages ago—"</p><p>"Bull<em>shite</em>," interrupted Regulus with a glare. "<em>No one</em> could figure that out correctly—"</p><p>"I'm a Ravenclaw, excuse me for having significantly higher cognitive abilities—"</p><p>"Are you calling me <em>dumb</em>, Crouch?!"</p><p>Hermione groaned, burying her face in her hands. "Could you two <em>not</em>? I've got a splitting headache."</p><p>"Sorry," muttered Regulus, a blush staining his cheeks.</p><p>"Yeah, sorry," echoed Barty, looking down.</p><p>"I'll – I'll tell you everything," continued Hermione, her voice low as she pulled her hands away. "I owe you that. But it's… parts of it… it's not always a <em>happy</em> story."</p><p>Regulus's eyes went soft, and he reached out to touch Hermione – to offer comfort or something – but there was a commotion at the end of the room, out in the hallway: the loud of loud voices, a woman's shrieks, and of Healers trying to argue back.</p><p>Hermione recognized the shriek, and judging by Regulus's wince, so did he.</p><p>The door at the end of the ward crashed open, making Barty tense and clench around the pudding cup in his hand. His father was the first through the door, his face full of thunder. Bartemius Crouch made a beeline for his son with his wife, Iris, on his heels, wringing her hands.</p><p>Behind them, Orion Black strode forward, his face blank – in direct comparison to Walburga's wailing, threats, and sneers that she directed at the gaggle of Healers that followed them in.</p><p>Hermione had met Bartemius and Iris Crouch and spent time with them the previous summer before Alphard Black's funeral, so they weren't a surprise; seeing Orion and Walburga, up close and not in portrait, was entirely different. The Crouches had kept her far from the Black family during Alphard's funeral – even James had ensured he and Barty were never far from her side when at the ancestral Black estate – so Hermione had never had the opportunity to look at the elder Blacks who were dead in her original time.</p><p>Both were good-looking – Orion just fifty, that year; Walburga fifty-four –, although with Walburga's sneer it aged her significantly, twisting her features reminiscent of Bellatrix's own ugly beauty, which could only come from the Crabbe/Rosier blood that ran through Walburga and her niece.</p><p>But neither went to their son, turning to the Healers instead. Orion was silent, letting Walburga demand answers to what their son experienced. On the other hand, Iris flew toward Barty and wrapped her dainty, thin arms around him, hugging him tight while his father approached, eyes flashing and practically foaming at the mouth.</p><p>"Oh! Oh, my Barty-bear," she murmured, drawing back, touching his cheek lightly with her fingertips.</p><p>The fact that Barty didn't call her out on the nickname or whine about it told his parents – and Hermione and Regulus – just how badly shaken he was from the encounter.</p><p>"I've heard from my Aurors when they were alerted to the disturbance of an intense level of magic being performed in Wiltshire," began Crouch, his voice low as his brown eyes fixated on the three teenagers, "And while I <em>will be</em> questioning each of you, personally—"</p><p>He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. Hermione saw his hands shake before he clenched them into fists. "First, how are you feeling?"</p><p>The three shared equally confused glances, and it was Barty who hesitantly began, "Father – we're… well, I won't lie – we've been better… but…"</p><p><em>We're alive</em>.</p><p>The words hung heavy amidst the five. It seemed the admission meant something to Barty, because, for a long moment, he just sat dazed, as if realizing what he personally went through: the kidnapping, the physical abuse, the fear of dying; fighting Death Eaters and even <em>Voldemort</em> and surviving.</p><p>Through sheer, dumb luck; through pure, iron will.</p><p>Barty's face went pale and he swayed where he sat, utterly dazed and breathing heavily. Immediately, Hermione and Regulus reached out to steady him, just as his mother cried, "Barty!"</p><p>He gasped, a hand pressed against his chest, hard. His brown eyes darted from his parents to his friends and he stuttered out, between gasps, "I can't breathe. I can't breathe!"</p><p>Crouch turned on his heel, shouting for Healers, causing them to turn from where they were trying to pacify the Blacks. Iris had no idea what to do, but Hermione, who had seen this in the immediate years after her Granger-self's future war, leaned forward and caught his eyes and held them with hers.</p><p>"You're having a panic attack," she said calmly. "I know it seems like you can't breathe, but you <em>can</em>."</p><p>Barty's eyes widened with panic as he still couldn't catch a breath.</p><p>"Okay," she said, her voice low making him focus on her. "Tell me five things you can see."</p><p>"What?" wheezed Barty, but when Hermione continued to watch him, doing her best to keep her face calm, he licked his lips and stuttered out, "You."</p><p>"Good. Four more," she offered.</p><p>"Reg. My – My mother," continued Barty, the words tumbling out quickly. "Father. The… the pudding."</p><p>Hermione huffed a laugh at the last one. "Great. What are four things you can touch?"</p><p>Blinking, Barty looked down and quickly grasped Hermione's nearest hand. "You."</p><p>"Three more," urged Regulus quickly, watching with wide eyes as Barty's breathing began to slow, just the tiniest.</p><p>"Um. The bed. And – and the pudding cup," continued Barty. His hand clenched around the fabric of his shirt. "My shirt."</p><p>"Three things you can hear."</p><p>"Your voice," muttered Barty, eyes fluttering closed. "The Healers. Mrs. Black."</p><p>"Two things you can smell."</p><p>"Healing potions and chocolate," he answered immediately, his breathing beginning to even out now.</p><p>"And one thing you can taste," finished Hermione with a quiet murmur and a small smile on her lips as she squeezed Barty's hand.</p><p>"Chocolate, from the pudding," he said, opening his eyes. His breathing wasn't as slow as it normally could be, but it was significantly less, and his panic attack had lessened enough that he could manage it somewhat.</p><p>A Healer had wandered over during the 5-4-3-2-1 method, at Mr. Crouch's side. "I've never seen that before."</p><p>"It's one of several methods," replied Hermione. "It doesn't work for everyone, but I counted on Barty's tactile nature. Reg would probably do better with a different technique if he needed it."</p><p>Shame covered Barty's cheeks. "I'm sorry – I don't know what happened—"</p><p>"It's nothing to be sorry about!" said Hermione fiercely, shaking his hand a bit. "I get them, too, Barty." She lowered her voice. "<em>I always have</em>."</p><p>Barty's brown eyes flew to lock on Hermione's, catching what she meant. But the moment passed as Orion wandered over, hands in his robe pockets as he stared down at Regulus, something inscrutable on his face.</p><p>"Son," he began, his voice low and cool.</p><p>"Father," began Regulus, trailing off as his Adam's apple bobbed nervously in his throat. He was pale as he stared up at the man.</p><p>"Black," interrupted Crouch with a sharpness to his voice, making Orion Black look over at Barty's father. "I don't really care if you knew what happened last night. I'll even go a step further and say I don't care about your politics – but what I <em>do</em> care about is that my <em>son </em>was tortured by mad witches and wizards and <em>I will be doing something about it</em>."</p><p>The two stared at each other for a moment, and then Crouch finished, his voice low, "What will you be doing?"</p><p>Orion seemed to be measuring Crouch, considering his words despite the cacophony of sound Walburga was making behind them. He didn't seem to want to say anything or tip his hand, and Hermione wondered how he got so good at his poker face when Sirius wore his emotion, and Regulus was easily deciphered the more you spent time around him.</p><p>By the door, where Walburga was holding court with several frustrated Healers, loudly jumping between complaints at the room, service, company ("Mudbloods and blood traitors, really!"), Walburga made a familiar noise to Hermione – a shriek – that had her, Barty, Regulus, and Orion and the Crouches look over.</p><p>Immediately, Hermione groaned into her hands.</p><p>"You!" shrieked Walburga. "How dare you show your face here, you blood traitor—"</p><p>"<em>Lovely</em> to see you, too, Mother Dearest, but I have a little brother to see," bit out Sirius with a sharp crack in his voice even as he hurried past her, his eyes already lingering on Regulus on his bed, closest to the door.</p><p>"Sirius—"</p><p>But Sirius pushed past his father, leaning into Regulus's space and cupped his shoulders, tight. His eyes were frantic as they roamed from the top of Regulus's head down his chest and then his hands – as that was all he could see above the blanket.</p><p>Regulus winced. "Sirius, please, it's too tight—"</p><p>"What did they do to you?" he barked, eyes furious as they snapped back up to meet Regulus's.</p><p>Nervously, Regulus's eyes skipped from Sirius to James for a quick second, but it was enough that Sirius caught it and whined, "Reggie, <em>please, tell me</em>!"</p><p>Orion cleared his throat and added, "I, too, wish to hear this."</p><p>Hermione watched as James sidled around the Blacks and then the Crouches, nodding once at Barty who quickly looked down at his pudding cup. He absently set it aside on Hermione's bed table even as James reached forward and laced his fingers with Hermione's.</p><p>Caught, Regulus sighed, slumping in the bed. "It wasn't much. They didn't do much but push me around a bit. <em>Petrificus Totalus</em>, mostly. Barty and Hermione had it worse."</p><p>James's hand tightened around Hermione's.</p><p>Orion glanced over at Barty and Hermione, still sharing a bed with Barty perched at the end with his parents bookending him, and then his grey eyes – similar in colour and shape to Regulus and Sirius – dropped down to her entwined hand with James'. He hummed thoughtfully.</p><p>"The worst of it was when we were escaping," continued Regulus quietly, not looking at anyone. "I – Hermione's been practicing with us and doing nonverbal spells, and some wandless, and we – well, I…"</p><p>"Regulus." Orion's voice was stern, but it was what the youngest Black needed.</p><p>He took a deep breath. "I electrocuted Bellatrix. Wandlessly. It damaged my hand." He looked up at his father, jutting his chin out just the tiniest bit, and added stubbornly, "But it was worth it."</p><p>Orion's mouth tightened, the tiniest amount but Sirius's split into a grin.</p><p>"You knocked down Bella without a wand?" he crowed, throwing his arms around Regulus. "Good on you, Reggie!" Then, he turned partially toward Hermione and added, "Great job, Princess – knew you were holding out on us in our defence tutoring sessions, though."</p><p>Hermione sighed, noisily.</p><p>"Mmm, yes, about Ms. Evans and my son," began Crouch, narrowing his eyes on his son, who froze. "The healers informed us about some of your injuries, Barty. Bruises, cuts… and a rather large scratch mark that appears several years old and caused by a Dark creature. Care to explain that?"</p><p>Mrs. Crouch gasped, tears welling in her eyes as the young wizards and witch all looked at each other.</p><p>Finally, Barty muttered, "Can't. Literally."</p><p>Crouch's mouth flattened into a line so thin that he appeared to have no lips at all. "<em>I beg your pardon</em>."</p><p>"Vow," added Regulus, unhelpfully and with a tiny shrug.</p><p>Crouch's face was turning purple in rage and Orion's own face had turned stony.</p><p>"I will uncover this," vowed Crouch savagely, almost spitting the words.</p><p>None of those involved said anything, knowing that even hinting anything more could play havoc with their magic and twist the vow they took, but Hermione knew that she was hoping Crouch could figure it out – he <em>was</em> a Ravenclaw.</p><p>He seemed to compose himself, although his words were clipped. "I will need the names of all the – Death Eaters – or whatever they call themselves, that you heard. Or any that you recognized. Malfoy Manor will be searched, and the Malfoys detained but your testimonies would be beneficial in aiding the investigation."</p><p>"The Malfoys are family," interrupted Walburga, having given up on bothering the healers. Crouch sneered at her, and she finished with a sniff, "Distantly, but still family. My son will <em>not</em> be speaking to you or your Aurors."</p><p>"<em>Married</em> family, and through your brothers," retorted Crouch. "Hardly counts."</p><p>"I'm happy to help," interrupted Regulus, his voice strong and clear.</p><p>Walburga sputtered in surprise as she stared at her son. "I apologize, Regulus, I must have heard you wrong—"</p><p>Regulus ignored her and turned to Crouch. "Head Auror, I am happy to provide testimony. When would be good? Or can my brother take the testimony?"</p><p>Sirius turned to his boss's boss, nodding frantically. "I can do it, sir, please—"</p><p>"<em>Regulus</em>!" the woman cried, aghast, but despite wincing at the noise, Regulus ignored her and kept his eyes firmly fixed on Crouch.</p><p>The man in question looked between the two, and then finally shrugged. "You're seventeen?"</p><p>Regulus nodded.</p><p>"Good enough, you're legally an adult," the man nodded. "Your brother will take your statement within the next twenty-four hours." He gave the elder Blacks some side-eye. "Will you be staying with your parents?"</p><p>"Yes, he will—" began Orion, but Regulus quickly spoke over him, saying, "I have a place."</p><p>Crouch's eyebrows shot up, re-evaluating the youngest Black. Finally, he said, "Don't leave town."</p><p>Regulus nodded, and Walburga began hissing something at him in a low, angry tone, while Orion stared at his sons. Both Regulus and Sirius were defiantly ignoring their mother, and Hermione cast her eyes down to see that Regulus had a white-knuckle grip on the back of Sirius's shirt, pulling the fabric tight – so much so that a part of it was cutting into Sirius's side. There was no way he couldn't feel it, but he did not move from his spot at his brother's side.</p><p>"Barty, you are being released," said Crouch, turning to his son and effectively ignoring the Blacks. "We'll be leaving shortly."</p><p>Barty's mouth turned down into a heavy frown and he glanced back at Hermione. "But what about—"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "Go."</p><p>"But—"</p><p>"It's fine." She stared at him, silently imploring that he leave St. Mungo's with his parents. She needed time to herself, and with James sitting silently by her side, she was more than a bit worried about what was going to come next.</p><p>Unhappy, Barty grumbled something under his breath but rose from her bed. "Fine."</p><p>Hermione said quiet goodbyes, Crouch nodding at her and instructing James to take her statement, his won eyes flickering over their hands, and then the Crouches were gone; Orion finally guided Walburga out, but not before a dozen threats against Sirius, and a few surprising ones toward Regulus, flew from her mouth. Eventually, it was the two Black brothers and Hermione and James.</p><p>"Are you being discharged, Reggie?" asked Sirius.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>"Then you'll come stay with me at my flat," suggested Sirius, but his tone offered no alternatives. "I know you said you have a place—"</p><p>"It's not much and there really isn't much of a bed," interrupted Regulus, catching Hermione's eyes.</p><p><em>Oh, </em>she thought, <em>he was going to stay at the Haberdashery</em>.</p><p>"Then you'll come to mine," finished Sirius firmly. "Let's get going."</p><p>Regulus sighed but slid from the bed, moving around to lean over and hug Hermione tightly. Against her curls, he muttered, "Haberdashery. One week from now. Dusk."</p><p>Hermione nodded, minutely.</p><p>Regulus drew back, nodded once at James, and then turned to join Sirius at his side. Sirius, surprisingly solemn, gave a weak smile to his best friend.</p><p>"Speak later, Prongs," he said and then turned his eyes to Hermione. "Feel better, Princess."</p><p>Then, the private ward was empty of all but them.</p><p>Swallowing, Hermione glanced at James and found him surveying her quietly. "What happened?" he finally asked.</p><p>So, Hermione told him about the train ride and what happened, about the Portkey Lestrange gave them, his apology, and then the catacombs. She winced when James's face went thunderous as she mentioned the cruciatus curse Voldemort cast on her, and kept casting, even as she kept getting to her feet until she no longer could.</p><p>James's hair, already a wet, unruly mess, seemed to become messier as parts stuck out in random directions, resembling the spikes on a hedgehog. Bit even crackled like they had frozen wet and someone was snapping at them as his magic manifested itself, the same way Hermione created lightning.</p><p>Hurriedly, Hermione finished with Malfoy Manor and frowned, ending with, "Where did Dearborn go? Did he not come back with us to St. Mungo's?"</p><p>"Probably Dumbledore," muttered James, looking away for the first time, his jaw clenching angrily. "He disappeared several months ago."</p><p>When Hermione didn't say anything, James looked back at her. He was visibly struggling to compose himself, taking some time before he breathed deeply and asked, "How are you feeling now?"</p><p>"Sore," admitted Hermione, looking down at her hands. The one James wasn't holding was trembling minutely. "I'm told I'll feel this way for a bit."</p><p>James swore under his breath. "We both knew he wanted you, but—!"</p><p>"I didn't think it would get to this, either," murmured Hermione, biting her lip.</p><p>Miserably, James added, "And now we've both defied him by refusing his offer <em>and</em> fought against him."</p><p>Hermione froze. "What did you say?"</p><p>"We both defied him—" James repeated, confusedly.</p><p>—… <em>to those who thrice defied him…</em>—echoed in Hermione's head. Thoughts swarmed on top of another, leaving disjointed fragments: <em>twice now – both of us – the Room spoke of destiny – what does this </em>mean<em>?</em></p><p>"Hermione?"</p><p>Startled out of her thoughts, Hermione's head jerked up. James was leaning close, peering at her with his brows furrowed and pinched. He moved from standing beside her bed to nudging her to sit hip-to-hip, his hand still holding hers tightly even as the other went around her back and snuggled her into his side.</p><p>"<em>Are</em> you well?"</p><p>Distantly, a part of Hermione was aware that she murmured, "I could have died," and James inhaling sharply – although Hermione had nearly died a few times in her other life, as well, particularly Malfoy Manor, the troll, and the basilisk. She had survived those incidents, grown stronger for them. She faced Bellatrix in battle, stood against Voldemort, and fought with Harry in the Department of Mysteries – twice! – only to have all that swept away by a strange twist of circumstances.</p><p>The battle in Diagon Alley wasn't even on her notice – Bellatrix was hardly an opponent compared to what she could be that Hermione had never worried about her life. But Voldemort… Hermione thought he was an idiot with his Horcruxes, and he could barely plan anything successfully in her other life, but… in the here and now? Unconsciously, she shivered, and James pulled her closer.</p><p><em>She could have died</em>.</p><p>Voldemort had been playing with her – testing her, teasing her magic, see how she would react. And now he knew that she was far more powerful than she had previously let anyone but Barty and Regulus know, and even they never knew the full extent of her abilities and transmutation experiments because she was a witch mentally in her sixties and physically in her teens, and until the previous day, she had kept that secret.</p><p><em>If Barty could figure it out,</em> she wondered, <em>could Voldemort?</em> She bit her lip as she peered at James. <em>Could he?</em></p><p>Never before had her dubious double-life been more of an issue, but at least this time it wasn't about whether or not she belonged – but rather, how it would change things. How it would change her relationship with Barty and Regulus… and eventually, with James. Would he still care for her? Look down at her for once thinking of not changing things and letting him die? Letting her own <em>sister</em> die to maintain the timeline? Or would he understand her fears, and still love her?</p><p>Something painful lanced through Hermione's chest at the thought. Even since throwing herself into living in her new time, Hermione never once considered that James would not be part of it. That Barty and Regulus would <em>abandon</em> her.</p><p><em>I can't let that happen</em>.</p><p>The thought rang loudly, as though all other ambient noise in the ward disappeared, leaving the thought at the forefront of her mind even as she stared at James, who frowned worriedly back at her.</p><p>An even smaller though, almost hidden, whispered, <em>I can't be alone anymore. I can't </em>do<em> this alone.</em></p><p>Words poured from Hermione's mouth without conscious thought.</p><p>"I never thought I'd like you."</p><p>Bewildered, James sputtered, "I – ah – what—"</p><p>"I honestly never thought that I would like you, after seeing how you treated others. The bullying, the teasing, the pranks." Hermione shook her head, her voice rising as she let the words trip over each other. "I hated it all but as long as it didn't touch me, I didn't care, but I didn't care about <em>anything</em>. I thought I was this – this island in an ocean, a single spell without focus, a leaf in the wind, aimless. I didn't need anyone, and no one needed me."</p><p>"Hermione…" James's mouth opened, and he looked mildly hurt.</p><p>"No, let me…" Hermione squeezed their joined hands. "Please. I thought I knew who you were. I thought that the first Arithmancy session would set the tone, show me who you were. I was expecting something, I believed something. Like everyone else, I expected you and my sister to begin dating, go off and marry—"</p><p>"Me and <em>Lily?</em> Blimey, Hermione—"</p><p>"But then—"</p><p>James paused. "Then?"</p><p>Hermione's voice softened. "We had… fun on New Years."</p><p>"It was the kiss?" there was something odd in his voice, a bit of a strangled frog.</p><p>Hermione laughed. "No. Gods, no. I think you thought I was Lily."</p><p>James's mouth twisted.</p><p>"Sometime after that, you… changed." She frowned. "Or maybe you didn't. Maybe I just never knew you the way I thought I did, and I just began seeing… <em>more</em> of you." She shrugged. "Maybe I was finally ready to see you. But whatever it was… I saw <em>you</em>. And I saw something that shook my entire world. It wasn't the only thing that changed things for me, I had other things going on – but maybe those things helped me see you better."</p><p>James swallowed thickly. "I'll admit," he began, his voice a bit hoarse and eyes a bit shiny behind his glasses, "That I never saw <em>you</em> until I met you for tutoring."</p><p>With a wobbly smile, Hermione offered, "Maybe we were both a little blind."</p><p>"Me more than you," joked James, although his voice was a bit shaky, as he used his free hand to point at his glasses.</p><p>"I realized though," began Hermione, voice hitching, "I realized… that I didn't want to be alone. I didn't want… I didn't want to be that leaf in the wind, the island in the ocean. I… I had Barty, and Regulus, but…"</p><p>James peered at her, and asked, a bit breathlessly, "But…?"</p><p>"Do you remember our talk? When you said you spied on me and Dirk?"</p><p>James immediately scowled. "I didn't spy—"</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, "You totally did, but that's not the point, James. We talked. Something shifted between us. Between then, and Diagon Alley, and Tuney's birthday… it was like…"</p><p>"Like?" asked James, softly.</p><p>Hermione smiled. "Like reading my favourite book all over again. Like learning a new spell and succeeding in it. Like my entire world was turned upside down and only in the best ways." Her eyes dragged up to meet James's. "Because <em>you</em> make things better. Things <em>are</em> better with you in my life. I—"</p><p>James swore he stopped breathing. "You?"</p><p>Hermione bit her lip and then forged on, like the Gryffindor she once was. "I – I love you. I love your bravery, and strength, and kindness. I love how you worry and how you are protective toward those you care about. I love you, even when you spy on me – but we've already decided you won't do that anymore—"</p><p>James gave a wet laugh.</p><p>"—and I even love the stupid way you run your hand through your hair when you're nervous," continued Hermione, her voice strong. "I love that you don't coddle me and that I can be myself around you."</p><p>"Your prickly, onerous, sarcastic and mean self, yeah," agreed James, a grin appearing on his face now.</p><p>Hermione, on the other hand, scowled.</p><p>James laughed, tugging at her hand. "Don't be like that!"</p><p>Giving a tiny humph, Hermione raised her eyebrows at him and then sighed. "I even love you when you're teasing me."</p><p>"Good," replied James, his hand coming up to cup her cheek and turn her head to him. "Because I love you, too. I have for a very long time, now."</p><p>"Right, about that," continued Hermione nervously, "Like I began this: I could've died."</p><p>"I don't want to be reminded about that right now, Hermione—"</p><p>"Well, <em>I could have died</em>, and it would've been without telling you I love you!"</p><p>James grimaced.</p><p>"And it made me realize," she said forcefully, glaring at him, "That I love you and I don't want to be alone."</p><p>"Okay…?" replied James, blinking owlishly behind his glasses.</p><p>Frustrated, Hermione sighed and repeated, "I love you and I don't want to be alone, James." She widened her eyes. "I want to be with you. Forever – and with Voldemort running around and after us now that we've both defied him – that could be days. It could be months. If we're lucky, it's years."</p><p>James's eyes went wide. "Hermione, are you—?"</p><p>"I know it's… it's not a leap year," fumbled Hermione, her voice pitching up in anxiety. "I know this isn't normal in pureblood circles, or hell, even for muggles, but I – I, well." She trailed off and then, shrugged. "I love you. I want to be with you. I… will you marry me?"</p><p>James's mouth dropped open. "I – you – you're asking <em>me</em>?"</p><p>Hermione nodded, mouth tightly clamped shut.</p><p>"Holy shit," muttered James, staring at Hermione.</p><p>Hermione's nerves skyrocketed. "Is… is that a… <em>no</em>?"</p><p>"No!" blurted James, making Hermione's eyes widen further. "I mean, I want to marry you, too! So, it's a yes. Yes, I'll marry you. It's just…"</p><p>"Just…?" asked Hermione, her voice trembling.</p><p>James pulled his hand from hers, and Hermione immediately felt the loss. His hand went to the pocket of his trousers and from it, he withdrew a tiny box. Sheepishly, he held it up and out to her, tapping the lid with a finger to open it. Inside was a ring, tasteful and to Hermione's preference: small, understated, with runes along the side of the band.</p><p>"I had this with me for <em>months</em> now," admitted James quietly. "I was going to ask when we saw each other next. It's, uh, kind of what purebloods do after graduation—"</p><p>"Yes, so Reg has told me," muttered Hermione, eyeing the ring.</p><p>"So, um, despite you asking me," began James, laughing a bit, and muttering under his breath, "Shit, Pads is <em>not</em> going to let me live this one down," he held out the box toward Hermione again, a bit closer.</p><p>"I already said yes," grinned James, "But if you don't mind adhering to <em>one</em> tradition, instead of trailblazing your own, would you wear this ring as a token?"</p><p>Hermione huffed her own laugh. "I ought to have <em>you</em> wear the ring, given I did the proposing."</p><p>"Next time," agreed James. "When I finally propose to you. It's only fair, right? You propose, I propose? I mean, I even asked <em>your father</em> for permission, Hermione, I went through all the muggle paces for you—"</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "Give it here, Potter—"</p><p>"Oh, <em>real</em> romantic, Evans—"</p><p>"Shut up, prat," grinned Hermione, tugging the box toward her, despite James still holding it. He grinned back, pulled the ring out, and slipped it onto her left hand's fourth finger. "Now, kiss me."</p><p>"You're really bossy, you know that?" said James, but he leaned forward and did as asked, a smile on both their faces.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>July 1979</strong>
</p><p>James did not let Hermione leave Potter's Peak, constantly fussing over her when he was home from work – and if he wasn't hovering, asking her how she was, then Dorea took up the mantle. Charlus was much better, often only engaging Hermione in conversation when they inevitably crossed paths – which was still far more than she expected – but their conversations were about what books she was reading from their library.</p><p>With Dorea, it was questions about her studies, her goals, her sisters, her parents, Cokeworth, what she wanted to be when she grew up before she knew she was a witch, about Barty and Regulus as her best friends, and then their family connections (she already knew that the Potters and the Blacks were second cousins as Dorea's brother was Sirius and Regulus's grandfather; but distantly, Barty's grandmother was a Black, making Barty and Sirius and Regulus second cousins, and then they were distantly related to the Potters through the Crouches' maternal line, with Barty's great-grandfather being Arcturus Black, whose brother <em>Sirius</em> Black was Sirius and Regulus's great-grandfather, and their other brother, Cygnus, was Dorea's father. The family connection made Hermione's head spin, and Dorea patted her on her head and said, sympathetically, "I know, dear. All purebloods are related.").</p><p>Of course, the Potters couldn't keep Hermione in Potter's Peak forever, and by the end of the week, Hermione was ready to burst, needing to escape. She had healed from most of her physical injuries, and while she still sometimes had muscle spasms from being tortured, she could function without help. And she missed her family.</p><p>With a promise of spending the rest of her time at Petunia's – as her parents had not been told how badly injured she was, leaving Lily and Petunia as the only two to know and Lily being the one to discharge her from St. Mungo's as her closest magical kin – Hermione kissed James goodbye and Disapparated not to Peckham, but to the Haberdashery.</p><p>Barty and Regulus were already there when she let herself in – keyed into the wards well before Alphard's death – and silently stood with rather solemn faces.</p><p>She paused at the entrance and said, quietly, "I owe you a story, I think."</p><p>Regulus nodded, and soon, the three were sitting on various surfaces: Barty and Hermione sharing a couch, and Regulus at his uncle's old armchair. Regulus had dug up a bottle of Alphard's, an aged honey-toned liquid that wasn't quite Muggle with the hot red rivets running through when the light hit the bottle the right way.</p><p>"Do you want this as a story, or do you want to ask questions?" asked Hermione quietly, looking at her glass instead of her friends. She swirled the liquid inside and watched the red turn into a whirlpool.</p><p>"Is it true?" asked Regulus, first. "Have you travelled through time?"</p><p>Hermione looked up. "My mind has. Not the body."</p><p>He exhaled loudly, closing his eyes. The hand not holding his tumbler shielded his eyes from her and Barty as he leaned over and braced that arm on his knees.</p><p>"Who were you before?" asked Barty, curiously. "You were a witch, I'm assuming."</p><p>Hermione nodded. "My name was Hermione Granger – I was born to two dentists in Crawley, in 1979. I attended Hogwarts in 1991 – but I never officially graduated. I never attended for my seventh year."</p><p>Barty's curiosity bled through even further when he asked, "Why not?"</p><p>Hermione's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "I was Undesirable Number Two in Voldemort's ministry."</p><p>"I – <em>what</em>?" gapped Regulus, dropping his hand. Then he paused, sputtering, "Voldemort was still around? But – the Horcruxes?"</p><p>"No one knew about them," answered Hermione, the same bitter smile on her face. "Well, other than you, Reg. Except… by 1991, you were long dead."</p><p>Regulus drastically paled, his hand going limp. Barty launched from the couch next to Hermione to catch the tumbler and placed it carefully on the side table.</p><p>"Okay," said Barty firmly. His face was rather solemn, his mouth a straight line as he glanced from Regulus's pale face and Hermione's rather blank one. "I think it's best we hear everything first and then ask questions, later. So… Hermione? Can you… tell us your story?"</p><p>Hermione leaned back against the couch with a sigh, closing her eyes.</p><p>"Where should I start, Barty?" she asked, her voice tight and pinched. "Do I begin with me attending Hogwarts, and making friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley? All the adventures we had together? Or should I begin in 1979, when I was born and what my life was like, growing up Muggleborn? Or do I begin with Voldemort's first fall, on October thirty-first in '81, when he murdered James and Lily Potter but was destroyed bouncing an <em>Avada Kedavra</em> off Harry?"</p><p>"Merlin," muttered Regulus.</p><p>Hermione opened her eyes and looked between her two friends. "No, I think I need to begin earlier, telling you what we knew and learned, although not when we learned it but in how it happened, chronologically."</p><p>Barty's eyes were wide.</p><p>"I suppose this actually all begins in the summer of 1899 when Gellert Grindelwald visited his great-aunt Bathilda Bagshot in Godric's Hollow and met Albus Dumbledore…"</p><p>Hermione talked, and talked, detailing what she knew and discovered through Rita Skeeter's <em>The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore</em>, and things Aberforth had confirmed later; she spoke of their shared ideals, of their separation, and their obsession with the Deathly Hallows. She mentioned how what happened between the two, of Arianna, of Credence – how it changed how Dumbledore handled things. At the same time all this occurred, a young, silly near squib fell for a muggle who didn't know she existed.</p><p>The story of Merope Gaunt and Tom Riddle was straightforward, as was the birth and existence of Tom <em>Marvolo</em> Riddle; many details were still missing, but there was enough from what Harry had told her and what they discovered through Petunia's notes.</p><p>Then, Hermione spoke of Voldemort's original rise to power; of Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix; of Sirius and Regulus's split and how the family further eroded and how he eventually joined the Death Eaters –</p><p>At that point, Regulus stood from the armchair, turned, and calmly walked past the bar and toward the back rooms, only to turn and enter the toilet. He left the door open, and from the couch, both Hermione and Barty heard him violently retch, coughing up anything he had eaten earlier as well as the three glasses of alcohol he had since Hermione began.</p><p>Concerned, Hermione partially rose from the couch, but Barty shook his head and she slowly sat back down.</p><p>When Regulus returned, he was incredibly pale but there was something in his gray eyes when he sat in his armchair and demanded, "Continue."</p><p>Slowly, she did – explaining what she knew of how the original Regulus learned of the Horcrux, thinking it was the only one, and how Kreacher nearly died, and then, eventually and slowly, she explained Regulus's initial death in the underground lake.</p><p>"That's why you wouldn't let me drink the potion," he finally said when she trailed off, her voice going a bit hoarse.</p><p>Hermione nodded. "I wasn't going to let you die again. Not if I could stop it."</p><p>"You were calling to people," remembered Regulus, quietly. "You called <em>Harry</em> and <em>Ron</em>."</p><p>"The same Harry and Ron you mentioned earlier?" asked Barty. "Potter and Weasley?"</p><p>"My best friends," answered Hermione quietly. "My brothers."</p><p>Barty's hand reached out and grabbed hers, squeezing tightly.</p><p>"What I saw – they were telling me I was buggering up the timeline." Hermione squeezed her eyes shut and sniffed loudly, even as she felt her eyes water and a few tears slip down her cheeks. "That I was killing Harry by being involved with James. He wouldn't be <em>Lily's</em> son anymore."</p><p>"That's not true," argued Barty fiercely, shaking their joined hands a bit. "It's not. You did <em>so much</em> to avoid them all. You're allowed to be happy, Hermione."</p><p>Hermione glanced at Barty. "Am I?" she asked.</p><p>He frowned, and she continued.</p><p>The increasing deaths, and then the betrayal of the Potters secret keeper – which made Regulus stand up and pace, knowing that James would have chosen Sirius – until she revealed it was Peter—</p><p>"<em>Pettigrew?"</em> blurted Regulus, spinning to stare at her. "How? He can barely find two matching shoes!"</p><p>"And that's precisely why," replied Hermione. "Because everyone underestimated him and he went looking for the one wizard who could protect him – and that was Voldemort, not his friends."</p><p>Barty's lips pulled back. "Is he going to be a problem?"</p><p>Startled, Hermione looked at him. She heard what he said, but she also understood it as <em>do we need to kill him</em>?</p><p>"I—" she bit her lip. "He hasn't… I haven't really interacted with him. I avoided Pettigrew, and Remus and Sirius whenever I could."</p><p>"You've been dating Potter for two years now," pointed out Regulus, and although his tone was incredulous, he was grinning. "How did you manage that?"</p><p>"Honestly, we just did a lot of dates in the muggle world," admitted Hermione, "or met up at Hogwarts. Anything else was in the wizarding world and we ended up in battles."</p><p>"Well, you'd best plan on figuring out the Pettigrew situation," said Barty firmly, "Given that you and Potter are engaged now."</p><p>Hermione groaned and let her head fall back against the couch. "We are, aren't we."</p><p>Regulus stared. "Hermione, that's generally what happens when someone asks the other to get married, regardless if <em>you</em> asked <em>him</em>."</p><p>Hermione grumbled under her breath a bit and the three fell silent.</p><p>"What happened?" asked Barty, eventually. The other two looked at him. "After… after Halloween?"</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips. "James and Lily died. Voldemort lost his body, but his soul was anchored here because of his Horcruxes. Harry was taken by Hagrid to Petunia's on Dumbledore's orders, and Sirius went after Pettigrew. When he cornered and confronted him, Pettigrew blew up twelve muggles and cut off his own finger, then disappeared down a sewer, leaving Sirius to be arrested by the Aurors and chucked into Azkaban without a trial."</p><p>There was a pause, and then Regulus turned, throwing his tumbler against the far wall with a loud, <em>"FUCK!"</em>, heaving heavily as he ran his hands through his short curls. The glass shattered and glittered in the fading light from the afternoon – the story having taken that long so far – and liquid soaked into the carpet. His eyes were squeezed tightly shut, and he grimaced in pain as Hermione and Barty watched, quietly.</p><p>"Fuck!" he shouted again. When he turned, he demanded, "Why didn't grandfather do anything?"</p><p>Hermione shrugged.</p><p>"Where was I during all this?" asked Barty quietly.</p><p>"By Sirius's arrest?" confirmed Hermione.</p><p>Barty nodded.</p><p>"About to attack Frank and Alice Longbottom," she said quietly, eyes still on Regulus as he wrestled with himself and his inner thoughts. "With the Lestranges."</p><p>Barty startled, a pained, "no," escaping his mouth as his eyes widened and he shook his head, unconsciously.</p><p>Hermione grimaced, her eyes flicking to him now. "I'm sorry."</p><p>Barty grimaced as well, looking down at his lap. "Azkaban?"</p><p>"Only for a few months," murmured Hermione, watching him carefully. The next bit was going to hurt him. "Your mother traded places with you under Polyjuice. She died there and you spent thirteen years at your townhouse, under your father's <em>imperius</em> and watched night and day by Winky until Voldemort and Pettigrew came for you."</p><p>"Well," said Barty, a mild tone of surprise at odds with his wide-eyed look. He blinked rapidly. "Well."</p><p>Regulus threw himself back into his armchair, glowering. He stared hard at Hermione, keeping his eyes locked on her. "Tell me Sirius escaped."</p><p>"He did." Her voice remained calm even as she held his stare.</p><p>"How long?"</p><p>She withdrew a bit into herself, curling her shoulders. "Twelve years. He was finally thin enough in his animagus form to slip through the bars. He swam to shore and then made his way south – to Harry."</p><p>Regulus breathed heavily, shuddering halfway through as though trying to contain sobs that wanted to escape. His hands clenched at his sides and the knuckles were white where the skin stretched painfully.</p><p>"I won't let that happen," declared Regulus hotly, sounding and looking more like the wizard in question. His eyes were bright and there was a furious vibrancy to him – something rare given how contained Regulus often was – and his hands were shaking, just as his voice was, cracking the slightest bit. "I won't let him go to Azkaban."</p><p>"It won't happen this time around," said Hermione gently, leaning across the space between the couch and the chair, far enough to reach out and grip Regulus's knee, the only thing she could reach. "I won't let it."</p><p>Regulus nodded, sharply. "Good."</p><p>"Well," said Barty again, his voice a bit lighter. "I guess after Voldemort lost his body and Reg was dead and I was my father's prisoner, things were better?"</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "For a bit, I guess."</p><p>Barty groaned.</p><p>Hermione then had to explain her Hogwarts years, from the Philosopher's Stone – which also included the troll, which had both Barty and Regulus staring at her like she had transformed into a nundu in front of them – to Professor Quirrellmort; then, it was explaining the Chamber of Secrets ("Wait! It's <em>real</em>?" gasped Regulus), the basilisk that lived there ("Fuck. <em>Fuck</em>," sputtered Barty), Harry's Parseltongue abilities, Lockhart ("Isn't he that mousy Hufflepuff that was four years below us?" asked Regulus), and Hermione being petrified for the majority of the year. She decided against her partial Polyjuice transformation as something they <em>really</em> didn't need to know.</p><p>Explaining Sirius and his escape from Azkaban in more detail meant explaining about the Ministry's excellent idea to post dementors at Hogwarts, the reveal of Sirius being Harry's godfather, and how everyone thought he was after Harry to finish Voldemort's job, only for them to figure out at the end of the year he was trying to <em>save</em> Harry – which led to Hermione explaining her use of a time turner.</p><p>"So, you've travelled through time <em>before</em>?" gapped an astonished Barty.</p><p>"That's different," explained Hermione, holding chopsticks in one hand as she dug through the takeout they got earlier, her story taking much longer than they had anticipated. Hermione was now sitting cross-legged on the floor, with Barty stretched out on the couch and his own take out container balanced on his chest (she wasn't sure how he managed to eat that way, nearly horizontal) while Regulus had managed to compose himself in the time since his discovery of Sirius's fate (Hermione wasn't looking forward to talking about her fifth year) and was perched on his armchair again.</p><p>"How so?" mumbled Regulus around his food. He lost all sense of manners around his friends.</p><p>"Using a time-turner is a closed-loop," she began, tracing a circle in the air with her chopsticks. "Harry cast a Patronus because he had <em>always</em> cast a Patronus at that moment. Buckbeak never died because we had already rescued him. The past, present, and future are intimately entwined. Just because you don't have the knowledge of what happens in the present doesn't mean it hasn't already happened for the future you who travels back."</p><p>"But this…?" Regulus trailed off, gesturing at Hermione with his own cutlery.</p><p>Hermione sighed. "Not a closed-loop since things have fundamentally changed. Not a paradox, either – nothing is going <em>boom</em>. Most likely my rebirth has created an alternate timeline."</p><p>"How do you know?" asked Barty, curiously as he peered at her from under his fringe.</p><p>"The Room of Requirement," said Hermione quietly. "I was having… these breakdowns, I guess, around fourth year, when I was doubted myself, my magic, the transmutations, everything. I was worried I was going to destroy the fabric of reality. But the room asked me: how do you know that <em>this</em> was never meant to be? It's possible that the future <em>I</em> knew was the alternate timeline and I was actually making things right by being here."</p><p>Barty's eyes went wide and he goggled at her. "Do you think that's the truth?"</p><p>She shrugged. "Who's to say? We'll never know."</p><p>The group was quiet for a bit, and then Hermione began on her fourth year, the TriWizard Tournament. When she mentioned Harry's name coming from the Goblet of Fire, the two other wizards groaned, having grown far used to the Harry Hermione explained about in her recount, about his luck.</p><p>They could tell there was something different with this year, with Mad-Eye Moody and the challenges, the Death Eater attack at the World Cup. When Hermione revealed it was Barty, the whole time, and as Voldemort's mastermind, Barty was torn between looking proud of himself for being so loyal and pulling the subterfuge off and utterly disgusted as a Death Eater.</p><p>Knowing he was Kissed by a dementor afterward made him put aside his unfinished takeout.</p><p>"So…" trailed off Regulus, glancing between the two. It was now dark outside, and the Haberdashery waiting room was lit by only the two streetlamps outside of the building and the crackle of the fire in the fireplace. "I was dead, and Barty as good as by 1994."</p><p>Hermione hummed her agreement.</p><p>Without warning, Barty launched from the couch toward Hermione, crashing into her so hard that she toppled backward onto the carpet, her empty container a victim of her flailing limbs even as Barty's arms wrapped around her.</p><p>"Thank you," he muttered into her voluminous hair. "Thank you for being here, for being born in this time. <em>Thank you</em>."</p><p>Hermione's frame softened and she wrapped her own arms around Barty, hugging him back. Moments later, Regulus was there, his own arms around them both and they were a puppy pile on the carpet, tangled limbs and shared breaths as the two wizards breathed beside her, realizing how much they owed Hermione for just existing, for taking interest in them as much as she didn't want to change things.</p><p>There, on the floor, Hermione eventually began again, telling them of the maze, and then what Harry had revealed over the years regarding the graveyard and Voldemort's rebirth. Then, it was about the smear campaign by the <em>Prophet</em>, Harry's anger, the Order of the Phoenix and their lack of doing <em>anything</em> – Umbridge, the neutered Defense curriculum, Dumbledore's Army, Mr. Weasley's attack, and then finally, Harry's vision and their race to the Ministry, and…</p><p>Regulus was still, the rise and fall of his chest against Hermione's arm the only thing letting her know he was still breathing. Finally, he muttered through a very nasally voice, "Keep going, Hermione."</p><p>She did: sixth year, Snape teaching Defense and Slughorn as their Potions professor; the prophecy, the quiet before the storm and Harry's lessons with Dumbledore that amounted to what she had previously known about Tom Riddle – the information she gave Petunia – and then, Harry and Dumbledore's trip in June to the Horcrux Regulus hid, only to return to Hogwarts under attack. In a monotonous voice, Hermione spoke of Dumbledore's death by Snape's hand and Draco Malfoy's inability to do so; of Harry and their plans to go Horcrux hunting after Bill and Fleur's wedding, of wiping her parents' memories and sending them away for their safety.</p><p>How Kingsley's Patronus came during the wedding: <em>"The Ministry has fallen,"</em> and their escape, living hand-to-mouth in the Forest of Dean, of the weight and constant anger they felt wearing the locket, Harry's slip, and then… Malfoy Manor.</p><p>Hermione found herself disassociating, recounting her torture under Bellatrix's wand almost clinically, downplaying the pain to just explain things factually, even the rescue and the recovery at Shell cottage before they realized they had the location of another Horcrux.</p><p>Neither Barty nor Regulus interrupted her, sensing they were coming to the end, so they let Hermione speak, explaining the Gringotts plan, their escape on the back of the Lestrange vault dragon, and then how not even two days later, they were at Hogwarts fighting for their lives. She touched on the deaths of people she knew: Lavender Brown, Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Fred Weasley, some of the Death Eaters; and then how Harry walked to his death and his miraculous survival and how he and he alone faced Voldemort and how the Dark Lord died.</p><p>She paused then, taking time to just breathe in the quiet darkness of the room.</p><p>"He got lucky," said Regulus eventually, breaking the silence.</p><p>"Who?" snorted Barty from Hermione's other side. "Potter or the Dark Lord?"</p><p>"Both," sighed Regulus. "We can't rely on that."</p><p>"Harry was the owner of the Elder wand, and he had all Deathly Hallow pieces if you believe the myth," answered Hermione, "And there was the prophecy."</p><p>"Which we have <em>neither</em> of," countered Regulus sharply. "Dumbledore will never give up the wand, even if you could get your hands on Potter's cloak and the resurrection stone when we go after the Horcrux – but we don't have a prophecy to fall back on."</p><p>"Nor should we," snorted Barty. "Those things are stupid."</p><p>"Hear, hear," agreed Hermione with a twitch to her lips that they couldn't see.</p><p>"So how did you end up here? If – if <em>he</em> was gone?"</p><p>Hermione turned her head toward Regulus, barely able to see anything but the white of his teeth and the flash of grey from his eyes as his hair blended into the surrounding darkness.</p><p>"I was meeting Harry and Ron for lunch," she began haltingly, trying to remember. So much of her life from then was gone from her now, as the years progressed, thanks in part to the Room's removal of her emotions to key scenes, and time for the rest, with her memories overlaid by those in the 60s and 70s.</p><p>She continued, slowly, "I saw Harry first – Ron wasn't at the Ministry anymore – when the alarms went off. There was fighting in the Department of Mysteries, and we both responded. There were Death Eaters there, or… some kind of Death Eaters, I suppose. They had masks and robes, but they didn't fight the same. We were in the time room, and Harry… he –" Hermione stopped, bringing a hand to her face to cover her eyes even as a tiny, laughing sob escaped her. She was smiling, though. "Gods, Harry <em>fucking</em> loved to use <em>expelliarmus</em>. It… it was like <em>his</em> spell. He cast it."</p><p>"On the Death Eaters, or…?" Regulus trailed off.</p><p>"I don't remember anymore," she admitted. "Just that the spell went wild, crossed with another, and then there was a blinding light – I remember thinking, something, I suppose, about Harry and wanting to kill him for using it – but… when I finally comprehended things, I was – oh, two? I think? And my last name wasn't Granger anymore but Evans, and I had two older sisters…"</p><p>"And then you were here," finished Regulus quietly.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>The three fell into silence, listening to the vague noise of traffic beyond them in muggle London and the snap and crackle of the wood in the fireplace. Hermione knew Barty and Regulus were absorbing what she had unloaded on them, and she wondered if it would change how they viewed her.</p><p>"I'm not omniscient," she finally said. "There are still things I don't know; that Harry never told me, or Dumbledore never told him. I may have the mind of someone now well into their sixties, but I don't remember things much anymore from my previous life. All emotion was stripped before I was born, and my memories are fading. Eventually, I doubt I'll remember my life as Hermione Granger."</p><p>"Does that bother you?" asked Regulus.</p><p>Hermione felt Barty shift to look at her better. "Yes, and no. I have a new life here that I embraced. But I will always miss parts of being <em>Granger</em> because she shaped me as I am now."</p><p>Barty's hand awkwardly patted down her side until he found her hand and squeezed it. "You have us now."</p><p>"I do."</p><p>Regulus did the same on her other side, finding her hand. Cautiously, he began, "What was it that you said you and Potter and Weasley always said? When things were tough at the end?"</p><p>Hermione expelled a quiet sigh. "Until the end."</p><p>Regulus's hand tightened around hers. "It's the same for me. For us," he amended. "Whatever knowledge you have; whoever you were before and whoever you are now – you're <em>Hermione</em> and our friend. I'm with you, Hermione. Until the end."</p><p>"Whatever that is," added Barty, solemnly. "I'm there, too. Until the end."</p><p>Hermione squeezed her eyes shut, tears leaking down the side and skidding down her cheeks to pool in her hair. What did she do to deserve two wonderful friends like Barty and Regulus? But –</p><p>
  <em>When did she turn into Harry?</em>
</p><p>She clutched at their hands in hers, and whispered back – hoping it wouldn't be the same as Harry, as prophecy and Dark Lords, nowhere near as fatalistic – with a tightness to her voice, "Until the end."</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>August 1979</strong>
</p><p>Regulus stared at the dilapidated building with the tiniest sneer on his face, his eyes roving from the sloped roof to the boarded windows and the rain-stained and slicked bricks that were crumbling and discoloured. "And you think the ring is <em>here</em>?"</p><p>"Well…" Hermione trailed off, a bit hesitant. "Maybe? Harry never said where Dumbledore found it."</p><p>Barty, on Regulus' other side, frowned and hunched over a bit, his hands in his pockets. The area around where Wool's Orphanage used to sit was now half-industrial, with empty factories and broken, yellow-tinted windows and graffiti with litter scattered everywhere. There was the faint scent of urine in the air, as well.</p><p>The tiny patch of what was once greenery beyond the warped and twisted metal gate to the orphanage was brown, full of dead grass and persistent weeds that give tiny bursts of green. The one, lone tree in the yard was a bone-white, dead skeletal limb raising to a cloudy sky. For all that it was August, the air held a hint of chill and rain.</p><p>"D'you think it's even safe to enter?" asked Regulus. "I'd really prefer to not die in a condemned muggle building. It seems a bit lackluster after learning how I died previously, and ways I could potentially die this time around."</p><p>Hermione's face pinched. "Could you <em>not</em> joke about your death, please?"</p><p>There was a dry look to Regulus when he retorted, "Oh, now you see how it is on the other foot, eh, Evans—"</p><p>Barty sighed. "Stop it, both of you."</p><p>"He started it," muttered Hermione, but she strode forward, through the gap in the gates and across the uneven, dead grass until she stopped before the partially rotten front door. There was a heavy lock and chain between the two door handles, but a tap of her finger and a quiet <em>alohamora</em> sent the chain slipping to the flagstone steps with a loud clang.</p><p>Barty winced as he came up behind her. "Hopefully, there isn't anyone around."</p><p>"If there is, we'll handle it," replied Hermione confidently, even as regulus shot her a look.</p><p>"I hope you don't mean 'handle it' in a permanent manner."</p><p>"I meant <em>obliviate</em>, no matter how much I personally hate it, but I would hate drawing <em>his</em> attention here because we left some defenseless muggles running around with the knowledge of three magic users are looking into the Dark Lord's old stomping grounds."</p><p>"Stomping grounds," snickered Barty, schooling his face seriously when Regulus shot him a glare.</p><p>The three entered through the door, slipping into a dark, echoing hall. The windows on the ground floor were boarded up, with only tiny slivers of light piercing through the cracks in the boards and barely cutting through the darkness within. As one, the three lit their wands, nonverbally, and Barty, as the tallest, held his the highest to illuminate the area. Something skittered away in the far corner of the hall.</p><p>"Where do we begin?" whispered Regulus, even though there was no one else in the building with them. There was something said for keeping quiet.</p><p>"Let's try the office first and if anyone left any records," suggested Hermione, just as quietly. "Then we can go from there."</p><p>With a silent nod, the three spread out, the light from their bobbing wands the only thing to tell where each was. The sound of doors opening and then shutting again reached each of the three as they spread out, Hermione going left and Barty right while Regulus went straight. Hermione was the one to find the office, full of the smell of animal poop and rotting wood and paper, most left behind and reduced to clumps of pulp, destroyed by the elements that managed to sneak their way into the room through the broken window in the office.</p><p>"Here!" she called over her shoulder, moving toward the large desk in the middle of the office and beginning to pull on the drawers. They were empty.</p><p>Barty first appeared in the doorway, moving directly to the shelving unit against the wall opposite the window. He paused before touching one of the few books left on the shelves. "Do we need to be careful or can we junk these?"</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "I don't see how it'll matter – it's clear there have been squatters here. Anyone after us will assume they did this."</p><p>"Fair enough," he cheerfully replied, and began thumbing through the book and then chucking them over his shoulder.</p><p>One nearly hit Regulus when he entered the room, ducking out of the way. "What the hell, Crouch!"</p><p>"Sorry."</p><p>Regulus glared because Barty didn't sound sorry at all. He turned back to Hermione, who sighed when she slammed the last drawer shut. "Anything?"</p><p>"Nothing," she replied, "And anything that could be useful here is about thirty years degraded, waterlogged, or faded. I doubt <em>reparo</em> would work, either."</p><p>"Room by room then?" suggested Regulus.</p><p>"Suppose so," agreed Hermione. "There are three floors, should we split up?"</p><p>Regulus made a face. "I feel like that is going to be a bad idea, but…"</p><p>"Aha!"</p><p>The two turned to face Barty, who held a half-filled bottle of… something in his hands.</p><p>"What is that?" asked Hermione with a face.</p><p>"Sherry, I think," replied Barty with a grin. "Spoils of war."</p><p>Regulus rolled his eyes. "Let's go. I'll take the ground floor; Barty's got the attic and Hermione's the second floor."</p><p>With the division made, despite Barty's complaints, the three split again, Hermione and Barty going carefully up the creaking wooden stairs. At one point, Barty did mumble "reparo," at a few split boards, firming the steps up so they didn't crash through to below.</p><p>With a nod at the top, Hermione turned down the hall while Barty moved to the side, finding the narrow stairs that led up to the roof attic.</p><p>Hermione had the bedrooms and one reception room; most doors were either open, shut (and locked), or there was no door, to begin with, like the reception room. The entire floor had a sense of gloom to it, with some windows boarded up and others dingy through the yellow-tinted glass from smog and pollution. There was a scent of neglect, rotten wood, and other things she didn't want to think about, and each step creaked and groaned as the building around her moved with the three new occupants made their way through.</p><p>The reception room had two couches, a few bookshelves, and a beautiful fireplace mantle that was probably worth a lot of money to someone who restored old buildings but had forgotten about Wool's once it closed. It was covered in soot, grease, and something else anyway, and Hermione turned away to inspect the rest of the room, from the lopsided and uneven couch with its missing legs, or the ripped and musty-smelling cushions. She tried to imagine Voldemort in that room, playing or quietly reading – as she knew him – and failed to do so.</p><p>There was no knickknacks or items left, so she moved to the room next to it, deciding on looking through all the rooms on the right and then come down the left side, returning to the staircase before joining Regulus on the ground floor. The next few rooms were bedrooms; two single rooms with just a rusty metal frame for the single cots in them, two porcelain sinks – one cracked – and the second room had a lonely, single wooden chair.</p><p>The third bedroom was a long hall, with several single cots. The metal on most of them was rusted, but a few still had lumpy mattresses, stained with watermarks and other things Hermione didn't want to think about. Dust most hovered in the air through whatever light managed to make it into the room through two, rectangular stained glass patterns high on the far wall, while the rest of the light came through four narrow windows with the glass still intact.</p><p>The wooden floorboards creaked under Hermione's soft steps as she moved through the room, down the aisle between the two rows of cots set up on either side of her with their headboards against the walls. The room was gloomy, devoid of personal artifacts and there was something sad about the place, about the young boys and girls who called Wool's home. Something lingered in the air, a disquiet that Hermione couldn't quite shake.</p><p>Leaving that room, she peered in three other single bedrooms, and one double, and then began the left side. At the fourth door, she found Tom Riddle's bedroom.</p><p>The moment she stepped inside, she knew it was his. There was a lingering, rank scent of dark magic and the sharp, acrid scent of greed and anger. The wardrobe on the far wall glowed in the dark gloom of the room with magic, by sight; and the cavernous silence that hovered over the orphanage outside of the room seemed muffled like there was a lingering privacy spell.</p><p>She was hesitant in reaching for the wardrobe door, casting a few detection spells on it she had learned from Bill Weasley once-upon-a-time, but if there had been any protections on the furniture, the spells had long eroded. With a sharp inhale, Hermione yanked one door open and held her wand up, aloft, and ready.</p><p>An empty wardrobe greeted her, and she gave a shaky laugh.</p><p>She peered in, looking for hints of Tom Riddle, and saw only the childish scratch marks of a young child claiming property: at the back of the wardrobe, etched in, were the words <em>This belongs to Tom Riddle. Touch at your own peril</em>.</p><p>"Dramatic little shit, even as a kid," she muttered, softly shutting the doors.</p><p>The final rooms held nothing, and Hermione turned to the entrance hall, where Regulus was already waiting, arms crossed and glaring at nothing in particular on the floor. He looked up when she made her way down the final steps of the stairs.</p><p>"Anything?"</p><p>She shook her head. "I found his room and it reeks of magic, but nothing recently cast. If there's anything here, it wasn't on that floor."</p><p>"Or this," added Regulus grimly.</p><p>They waited in silence for Barty, who appeared shortly after, a shake of his head revealing he found nothing, either. He scuffed the toe of his shoe against the dirty floor. "I guess the Dark Lord didn't consider this place important."</p><p>"I think he wanted to escape it more than anything," said Regulus. "I certainly would. It's even more miserly than Grimmauld at its worst."</p><p>Hermione cringed at the image.</p><p>The three left the building, Hermione taking the time to relock the chain around the handles. It wasn't until they had left the property and were once again at the road, past the gates, did Regulus speak.</p><p>"No ring here," he muttered.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "No."</p><p>Barty glanced at Hermione. "Should we go after the Cup next?"</p><p>"In <em>Gringotts</em>?" replied Hermione, incredulously. "No way. We need a plan for that unless you want to re-enact the great Gringotts Escape that Harry, Ron, and I did."</p><p>Barty paled. "No, thank you."</p><p>"Malfoy Manor is out of the question, too," sighed Regulus, rubbing at his mouth a bit. He grimaced at the feeling of a bit of stubble growing in. "I still haven't thought of how we can either get into the place after what happened in June; or if I can safely ask Cissy for help."</p><p>"So…" Barty swallowed a bit thickly. "Little Hangleton, then – to his mother and father's?"</p><p>Hermione frowned. "Yes… and let's hope this is the end of our trip down Voldemort-memory lane."</p><p>Barty snorted, even as Regulus moaned, "You just ruined it, Hermione, just you wait… you doomed us."</p><p>Hermione just scowled at her friend, and the three Apparated away.</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC…</p>

  <strong>Late August 1979</strong>
</p><p>Hermione and James got married on the last weekend of August during the Bank Holiday, in a shotgun-style wedding with only Petunia, Sean, and Sirius attending. There was some debate over inviting Remus, Peter, Barty, Regulus, and their respective parents, but ultimately, knowing that Dorea was likely to turn the wedding of her only son into a production, the two agreed to a tiny civil ceremony in London, getting extra copies to later register with the Ministry of Magic.</p><p>It was quiet, low-fuss, and just the way Hermione wanted it. Sirius was unable to spike any drinks, and being in Muggle London, both he and James had to behave. But at Petunia and Sean's afterward, as they were hosting their small reception, it was a free-for-all, with Remus, Peter, Barty, and Regulus also attending; Lily snuck in as the party was going, settling in a corner to talk to Remus while nursing a drink.</p><p>It was also the first time that Barty and Regulus would be around the people Hermione had mentioned in from the future, and she was curious as to how they would handle things. Initially, Regulus froze when he walked in and saw Sirius laughing at something James had said, eyes wide and pale-faced. But he rallied and walked straight to his brother, congratulating James, and then engaging them, and Peter, in conversation.</p><p>Barty hesitated for a moment in the entrance, looking like he very much needed to have that conversation with Sirius – but that day was not today, and instead, he turned and walked toward Petunia and Sean who were sitting with Hermione on the couch.</p><p>At some point, Sean and James had done a food run, with Sirius gamely joining them, and the group had settled in the living room: Petunia, Sean, Hermione, and James were on the couch, squished together; Remus, Lily, and Peter were on the floor on one side of the coffee table; and Barty, Regulus, and Sirius were on the other side of the couch, pressed against the wall with the window overlooking the estate.</p><p>While getting some more food, Lily and Hermione had a few moments to speak to one another, and Lily shyly murmured, "Congratulations."</p><p>"Hmm?" asked Hermione, eyes on the side dishes laid out on Petunia's sparkling countertops.</p><p>"On your marriage," continued Lily, catching Hermione's eyes. "I know it never seemed like I was your biggest fan, recently—"</p><p>Hermione snorted.</p><p>"—But you and Potter? You really do complement one another well," she finished, tucking a piece of long, auburn hair behind her ear. "We wouldn't've worked out, I'm sure."</p><p><em>Don't be too sure,</em> thought Hermione, but then she paused in her thoughts; after all, James and Lily from her time died at twenty-two. Who knows who they would've been at twenty-five, or thirty, or forty…?</p><p>"Thanks," replied Hermione instead, quietly. The two sisters were quiet then, each spooning something onto their plates. There was an awkwardness that was normal between Lily and Petunia, but rare between Lily and Hermione until the events of Hogwarts; and now that they were out of it, the chasm between the two sisters seemed wider and smaller at once, particularly with Voldemort's kidnapping.</p><p>"Erm," began Lily, causing Hermione to startle as she darted her eyes at her. "You're the one who put up wards around the complex, right?"</p><p>"You could tell?" asked Hermione in dismay. She thought she had done a subtle job with them, with Barty and Regulus's help and spellbooks from Alphard Black's private collection.</p><p>Lily shook her head. "No, not until Remus pointed them out."</p><p><em>Curse Remus Lupin and his sensitivity to magic,</em> thought Hermione, although not viciously. She would need to redo the wards, though.</p><p>"I never knew you were interested in wards."</p><p>"I <em>am</em> an Arithmancy prodigy, Lily," retorted Hermione without heat. She did roll her eyes, though. "Wards are based in maths and charms – two of my best subjects."</p><p>"And the other was Ancient Runes," replied her sister, with a grin. Lily's emerald eyes sparkled, and Hermione turned away quickly so she couldn't see her catch her breath from the fond memories of Harry slamming into her. "You built some impressive work, here. Remus kept going on about them."</p><p>"I'll be sure to speak to him about it then." Hermione cleared her throat, looking down at her plate. "I think this is enough for me. I'm heading back in."</p><p>Quickly, Hermione spun on her socks and left the kitchen, immediately going to James's side and cuddling into him. While she would have also liked to grab Regulus and Barty and vent at them – given their knowledge now – there was something comforting about James pressing a kiss to her temple, the warmth of him soaking into her, and even the smell of the muggle beer he was drinking that Sean gave him, mingling with his natural scent.</p><p>"Alright?" he murmured quietly, eyes on her. He snuck a spring roll from her plate and grinned, his glasses catching the light in the room from a lamp.</p><p>"Yes," she replied truthfully, sharing her plate with him, and letting the rumble of his voice through his chest – pressed against her back – move through her as he got caught up in recounting a Marauder's prank with Sirius, Remus, and Peter to Sean, who laughed uproariously at it.</p><p>As the meal wound down, Sirius cleared his throat, catching everyone's attention. He raised his mismatched mug from Petunia's cupboards – filled with alcohol – in a toast. He stood from the floor.</p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen, wizards and witches," he began, grandly gesturing as he spoke. The liquid sloshed in the mug and Petunia cried out. "I have seen many, many wondrous things as a wizard. But the greatest of them all was being the best man at my best mate's wedding."</p><p>Sirius looked at James and Hermione, his eyes a bit glassy. "I was worried that Princess was going to change things when you started dating."</p><p>Petunia turned to stare at Hermione, eyes wide when she mouthed, "<em>Princess</em>?" at her.</p><p>"<em>But</em> – I have never been gladder to be proven wrong," continued Sirius, sniffing a bit. "And if Prongsie can get married, well—" he turned to Remus and Peter, a bit of a wicked grin on his face. "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o4uLamLGrw" rel="nofollow">There's hope for our arses as well</a>!"</p><p>The group cheered, drinking, and Sirius sat down next to Regulus.</p><p>James, a bit thickly, began speaking, "Thank you to our friends and family for attending our little party."</p><p>Sirius brought two fingers to his mouth and whistled loudly; it cut off sharply when Remus smacked his back, causing him to sputter. "Oi, Moony—"</p><p>James blithely ignored the byplay and continued. "I know that mum wanted a large society wedding, but, well," he stopped and looked at Hermione, who smiled back at him. James, despite being pressed tightly against Hermione's side, shoulder-to-shoulder, managed to pull his arm out and wrap it around her shoulders, drawing her closer to his side. "This was exactly what we wanted."</p><p>Petunia sniffed loudly, and Sean silently passed her the box of tissues from beside him.</p><p>"And I know we also said no gifts, but…" James trailed off and looked at Hermione, his lopsided grin on display even as Hermione startled. What could James possibly give her? And why hadn't he told her they were doing gifts?</p><p>James turned so he was facing Hermione and took both her hands in his. "I know you've spent time at Potter's Peak, and here with Petunia, as well as your parents' home in Cokeworth. But we're married now and as a wedding present… I want us to have our own space."</p><p>Since everyone in the room was magical or "in the know," James was able to use his wand. With a flourish, he withdrew a small case from his suit pocket and handed it to Hermione.</p><p>Curiously, Hermione took it and felt along the edges, wondering what was in the small square case. It was too large for a ring – and she already had a lovely engagement ring that James gave her when she proposed, as well as a wedding band – but too small for a necklace. Maybe earrings or a bracelet?</p><p>Hermione glanced up at James. He was smiling gently at her, just basking in happiness, even as he waited for her to open the gift.</p><p>"Well! Open it!" demanded Lily, causing Hermione to glance at her, her sister grinning and leaning forward over the coffee table. With a blush, Hermione listened and snapped open the case.</p><p>A key was inside.</p><p>Brows furrowed, Hermione took the old fashioned, long, and heavy key from the case, holding it up. She looked at James, questioningly.</p><p>"It's to a cottage my family owns," he explained. "I thought we could use it as our own place."</p><p>"Where?" asked Hermione, heart pounding.</p><p>"Godric's Hollow."</p><p>"<em>NO!</em>" shouted two voices.</p><p>James's hands tightened around Hermione's, even as everyone turned toward Regulus and Barty, both with panicked looks on their faces. Barty had even partially risen from the floor, ready to throw himself at the key as though that would change things.</p><p>"Uhh…" began Sirius, glancing at his brother and Hermione's friend. "Is there a problem with them getting their own place?"</p><p>Barty's face settled into a heavy scowl. Regulus smoothed his face, also physically smoothing the front of his fancy robes as though to reassure himself. With a glance at Barty, Regulus cleared his throat.</p><p>"Erm, Barty and I also had a wedding present," he began, eyes flickering around the room at the others. Both Lily and Remus appeared a bit shocked, but not as much as Peter who had his mouth open; James seemed startled but confused, and both Petunia and Sean were frowning. Hermione, however, was looking at them sadly.</p><p>"You do?" asked James, slowly.</p><p>Regulus nodded, and Barty added, "A London townhouse from my mother's family: the Fawleys. We weren't using it, and after discussing it, father signed it over to Hermione."</p><p>"What the fuck," muttered Sirius, looking as poleaxed as James did.</p><p>"<em>No way</em>," breathed Peter, eyes wide. "Your father just signed over a family house?"</p><p>Barty nodded, a bit tersely.</p><p>"Is that… is that a big deal?" asked Petunia hesitantly, looking around the room.</p><p>James slowly nodded. "Houses are part of a family's magic. The more magic done in a house, especially an ancestral one where the main family branch lives in every day, the more magic will be soaked into it. It adds to the protections, the land. To give a family home away, would be like giving away a part of you to someone else. You're literally giving someone else your magic."</p><p>Hermione tried very hard not to snort at the idea of giving a magical house away to the equivalent of donating a kidney.</p><p>"Well…" continued James, befuddled, even as his eyes glanced over at Regulus and Barty several times before returning to the key Hermione held. "We can always save this as a summer retreat or something else. It's part of the Potter family entitlement, so it's not going anywhere…"</p><p>Hermione dipped her head a bit and whispered to James, "Are you sure? We don't have to take Barty's gift."</p><p>Her heart thundered in her chest though, despite her words. The idea of staying at Godric's Hollow – at the Potter cottage where James lost his life, where her sister lost her life in another time and orphaned her best friend – made her sick. But she would deal with it if James pushed.</p><p>"No, no, it's fine," replied James. "This is a fantastic gift, and we shouldn't slight the Crouches like that. Especially since Crouch is a good friend of yours."</p><p>Hermione exhaled lowly, even as James turned to face Barty and thank him.</p><p>Later, when Hermione cornered Barty in petunia's kitchen, grabbing a refill of his pad Thai, Hermione muttered, "Was there really a townhouse?"</p><p>Barty's head jerked up, and his eyes darted to the kitchen entry. He turned back to Hermione and lowered his voice. "There's a townhouse, but father didn't sign anything over. It was titled to me as the Crouch heir from mother's father. Mother has only sisters, all who married into prominent houses with their own land and titles, so grandfather gave me something."</p><p>"Barty," began Hermione, blinking rapidly, "You're giving me <em>your</em> home?"</p><p>He shrugged. "It's not like I was going to use it, was I?"</p><p>"You're too good to me," murmured Hermione, reaching out and hugging him tightly, ignoring that both Barty's hands were busy, one with a plate of food and the other with a utensil.</p><p>"I really think it's the other way around," he replied but smiled and pressed his chin into her shoulder.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>September 1979</strong>
</p><p>With the ability to Apparate, distance didn't mean much for witches and wizards. Sirius also visited often, stating that the Crouches' wedding gift of the Knightsbridge townhouse was much nicer than his bachelor flat in Camden town – and because he couldn't be bothered to cook, take-out was becoming dull, and Hermione made a mean pasta bake.</p><p>Grimmauld Place wasn't exceptionally far for a wizard to easily pop in and out of when it came to visiting friends, so Regulus was a near-permanent fixture at the townhouse, as well; usually when he knew Sirius would be by. Barty also visited regularly, whenever he knew Sirius wasn't around, as his family house was in Belgravia. Mostly, Barty and Regulus would visit her when they knew James had an Auror shift, so they could continue to plan their next move against Voldemort – but also to catch up on their lives and to see if Sirius and James were sharing information, as well.</p><p>"Mother's practically locked herself in her bedroom," admitted Regulus one day during a visit. "Refused to leave; wails the entire time. Kreacher waits on her hand and foot, but Father said to ignore it, so I have."</p><p>"How has he been?" asked Hermione carefully.</p><p>Regulus shrugged. "Strangely well, I think? He's cut back on some deals he had made with people – business deals – but he's mostly been quiet. Hasn't said anything to me about the kidnapping or even asked me to tell him about it."</p><p>"Unlike <em>my</em> Father," snorted Barty.</p><p>"Oh, he didn't like our statements?" asked Hermione in dismay. She thought she had done well with Sirius, who had taken hers; she only skipped over some of the bits in the dungeon.</p><p>"The submitted statements were a bit too similar," answered Barty with a sigh.</p><p>"What?" Regulus frowned. "But Hermione was interviewed separately."</p><p>"By Sirius," answered Hermione with her own sigh. "And James took yours and Barty's. The two of them must have conferred before submitting them and edited any strange inconsistencies out."</p><p>"It's been two months," replied Regulus with a heavier frown. "Sirius should have confronted me before now."</p><p>"He's probably waiting," replied Barty, lazily, even as he sat back on the couch. "Although, Father was pleased enough with our information. He managed to get a few of the Death Eaters arrested, but not the Malfoys."</p><p>"Shame, that," said Hermione.</p><p>"Eh, it wasn't all bad," continued Barty. "They lost their vault and most of their properties – Lucius only has his trust vault and established business deals to move forward on, and his townhome. So, the Malfoy's lost <em>a lot</em> of their influence."</p><p>"Cissy's been pretty upset about it," nodded Regulus knowingly. "Mainly because she's pregnant and worried about what her son is going to inherit as the Malfoy heir."</p><p>"The worst is that Abraxas and Colette Malfoy skipped the country."</p><p>Hermione's mouth dropped open. "What?"</p><p>Barty grinned. "Malfoy to France, and his wife to Italy. That ought to say something about the state of the Malfoys!"</p><p>"It's good for us," added Regulus quietly, with a fervor in his eyes. "Another blow to <em>him</em> is a boon to us."</p><p>Hermione nodded slowly, in agreement, even as her thoughts spiralled and wondered just what that meant for the timeline – and how much else was changing.</p><p>As it was, Hermione's nineteenth birthday snuck up on her. But it was quiet, as per her request.</p><p>She celebrated with her parents, grandparents, uncle, Lily, and James, in Cokeworth the weekend before; being in London meant Petunia stopped by regularly to their new townhouse Knightsbridge, despite it taking an hour on the Tube. The two sisters, much closer than with Lily, had been spoiled by James for Hermione's birthday, who booked them high tea at the Savoy. Petunia wouldn't stop gushing about it (causing Sean to complain to his brother-in-law about setting unfair high standards).</p><p>With the ability to pop anywhere, anywhen, Hermione didn't think of it later that day when James stammered something about heading out for a quick visit to Sirius's.</p><p>She was in the process of reading an owl from Barty (<em>I went by the Granger's, to see their little girl. I know you couldn't but – they weren't there. I'm sorry. No one in Croydon has heard of them—</em>), who could slip into the Muggle world easily when James came back home a bare five minutes later, looking traumatized: wide-eyed, his glasses askew, high more wild than normal, and a panicked expression on his face that only disappeared the instant he shoved the box he was carrying at Hermione.</p><p>"Here," he said, forcefully. As soon as Hermione took it from him, he shuddered. "Happy birthday."</p><p>Hermione stared at the box. It rattled a bit. She then looked at James. "Should I be scared? Are you trying to tell me something? Is this a prank?"</p><p>"Gods, no, not a prank," he shuddered again. "Just… I think you'd like it?" his voice rose at the end, and he winced. "I hope you'll like it."</p><p>Cautiously, Hermione peered at the box again, noting that the box was not wrapped normally: the bottom was wrapped in birthday paper with bursting fireworks of blue and bronze and smoky clouds and drifted lazily across the wizarding paper. But the top of the box – its lid – was separate, and separately wrapped in matching paper with only a bow on top. There were several punctured holes along the top of the box.</p><p><em>Air holes</em>, Hermione realized as she lifted the lid.</p><p>Something inside hissed.</p><p>Hermione froze, dragging her eyes from the dark interior of the box to James. "I really hope you didn't get me a snake, Potter."</p><p>James stifled a snort, feeling a bit more courageous now as he moved to sit beside her on the couch in their living room.</p><p>"Heaven forbid I do such a thing, <em>Potter</em>," he replied, emphasizing their shared last name.</p><p>With a grin, Hermione turned back to the box and removed the lid entirely. The creature instead hissed again, but this time added a growl when Hermione peered over the lip of the box.</p><p>"Oh, my God, James!" gasped Hermione, blinking back tears as she stuck her hands in the box and withdrew the small, squirming ball of orange fluff. It mewed pitifully when it realized it couldn't escape her grasp.</p><p>Beaming from beside her, James asked, "You like him, then? The store owner said he was the last of his litter, and no one wanted him, and I just thought—"</p><p>Hermione turned the kitten to face her and at once nearly burst into tears upon seeing the familiar, squashed face. <em>"Crookshanks!</em>"</p><p>"Crookshanks?" repeated James, amused. "Is that what you're naming the beast?"</p><p>"Oh, he's adorable!" continued Hermione, ignoring James entirely. The kitten was settling as Hermione ran a finger over the top of his head, between his ears and then down his back where she could reach. She moved to settle the kitten against her chest, who began to purr and knead.</p><p>"Well, I see he's found my favourite spot," grinned James, looking down at the kitten curling against the top of her breasts.</p><p>"Shut it," replied Hermione without heat. She reached over and pressed her lips against James's cheek, and then he turned his head and they kissed properly. She let her lips linger over his, once, twice, and then drew back. "Thank you. This is a wonderful birthday present."</p><p>Hermione spent the next several hours playing with or gushing over Crookshanks, while James watched on; at one point, he began playing with his snitch, only for the glint of gold to catch the kitten's attention – who then launched himself at James's chest, claws out as he scrambled up the wizard's body for a perch on his shoulder to bat at the snitch.</p><p><em>"Fucking hell!"</em> swore James, scowling with his glasses askew as he tried to pry the kitten off his shoulder. Crookshanks' claws dug in and James cried out.</p><p>Hermione, crying tears of laughter, tried to feel bad, but instead wheezed, stuttering out, "I-I'm going t-to start d-dinner."</p><p>Hermione preferred to cook with a mix of magical and non-magical means: while the prep work was done by magic, the way that Molly Weasley taught her – the chopping of vegetables, for instance – Hermione preferred to cut her meat by hand, as well as monitor the sauce, even if she twitched her wand to remind the wooden spoon in the boiling pasta pot to stir every so often.</p><p>She was humming, absently, as she moved from counter to stove and back when a gong echoed throughout the ground floor of their townhouse.</p><p>"I'll see who it is!" called James from the sitting room, moving to the entrance hall where, off to the side, was an Apparation point warded against entry without permission. For wizards, it was the equivalent of knocking on a door.</p><p>When no sound followed, Hermione stilled, her hand clenching on her wand as she slowly turned to face the kitchen entrance. Her mouth pulled down in a frown, and she slowly slid across the floor, uneasy.</p><p>Had someone attacked them? Attacked James in their own house?</p><p>"Hermione," called James, his voice a bit terse. "Can you come here please? The Headmaster is here to see you."</p><p><em>The </em>headmaster<em>?</em> thought Hermione, her breath hitching. She narrowed her eyes and absently wiped her hands down the front of her jeans but left the kitchen and entered the living room.</p><p>Crookshanks was curled on an armchair with his eyes half-lidded and fixated on the headmaster – <em>I have no idea how he got there unless James put him there,</em> thought Hermione, given how small the kitten way – and James was sitting on the couch with Albus Dumbledore sitting in the other armchair, his hands folded in his lap. Between the two armchairs and the couch was their coffee table was a tea set, one Hermione <em>knew</em> they didn't have; Dumbledore must have conjured it.</p><p>Hermione glanced at James, who patted the couch next to him. Hermione made her way and sat on the very edge of the seat, deliberately slipping her wand into her sleeve.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled at her. "It's good to see you again, Ms. Evans – ah, excuse me. Mrs. Potter. Congratulations on your marriage as well!"</p><p>"Thank you," she replied, in a pleasant tone. She tried to keep her face gentle and soft, despite how much her heart was thundering.</p><p>"Tea, Mrs. Potter?" asked Dumbledore, reaching forward, and pouring from the teapot into one of three delicate china cups he had arranged. "Do you take yours with sugar or lemon? I can't seem to remember seeing you drink tea during your time at Hogwarts."</p><p>"I prefer honey," said Hermione, fighting the urge to scowl. How <em>dare</em> Dumbledore play host in her own house? "Although with supper soon, I won't indulge."</p><p>"Ah, of course," the headmaster nodded, turning to James. "James?"</p><p>Her husband squirmed in his seat but shook his head. "No, thank you."</p><p>Dumbledore seemed mildly disappointed but ended up making the tea to his preference while vanishing the two other cups. The three sat in silence.</p><p>"What brings you by, Headmaster?" asked Hermione eventually, a part of her aware of the pasta and sauce bubbling away in the kitchen.</p><p>"I wanted to speak to you about your… kidnapping, Mrs. Potter," began Dumbledore evenly, looking at her from over the rim of his cup as he held it delicately between the thumbs and middle fingers of both his hands. His blue eyes twinkled. "You did something that few can claim: survive Voldemort."</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "I already gave my statement to the Aurors, Headmaster."</p><p>"Yes," agreed Dumbledore, slowly, even as he put his cup down. "You were quite brave, Hermione. All of you were."</p><p>Hermione's eyes narrowed. Did he have access to the Auror statements? She cut a glance at James, who was glancing between her and Dumbledore, a rather serious expression on his face. Or did James and Sirius tell him? Or… Caradoc Dearborn?</p><p>Dumbledore seemed to realize that she wasn't going to speak, so he continued. "Your bravery is inspiring, my dear. Being able to stand up against Voldemort, and his Death Eaters, and come out on the other side is an achievement! It takes skill to utilize the magic you wielded that evening."</p><p>"My OWL and NEWT scores demonstrate my skill, I like to think," said Hermione carefully. "Pardon me, Headmaster, but I have dinner on the cooktop, so I must ask: what is this about?"</p><p>Dumbledore peered at her, and then reached into his robes to withdraw a golden envelope. He handed it over to her, across the coffee table, and with trepidation, Hermione took it. She flipped it over and saw the red wax seal with a pressed phoenix in it.</p><p>She sighed, almost disappointed. She worked <em>so hard</em> to stay under his notice! At what point did it seem like she <em>wanted</em> or even cared to be part of his group?</p><p>"That is an invitation to the Order of the Phoenix, a group of individuals who are dedicated to ridding the world of Voldemort," began Dumbledore, launching into his pitch.</p><p>Hermione interrupted. "How?"</p><p>"I'm sorry?" sputtered Dumbledore, blinking in surprise.</p><p>"How are you ridding the world of Voldemort?" Hermione asked, doing her best not to mock. Because out of the two of them, <em>she</em> had done far more than Albus Dumbledore had managed in thirty years.</p><p>"Hermione!" blurted James, mouth agape.</p><p>Hermione did not look at her husband, focusing on Dumbledore, but his forehead instead of his eyes. She didn't want any Legilimency attacks, thank you.</p><p>"No, no, James. Hermione has the right to ask that! Ms. Evans was always an inquisitive one," chuckled Dumbledore, physically waving a hand as though he were waving off her concerns, as well as acknowledging her maiden name instead of her married one to separate her from those in his group. "We stop any Death Eater attacks on innocents."</p><p>"Mm." Hermione pressed her lips together. "So, you're reactionary. But what about Voldemort? What are you doing about him? It's one thing to stop or arrest his Death Eaters, but what about their leader?"</p><p>Dumbledore now pressed his lips together, the twinkling in his eyes growing a bit dim. "That is something I am working on but would prefer not to say at this time, Ms. Evans."</p><p>"Potter," she broke in sharply, annoyance licking at her. She felt her magic begin to stir in response, nearly vibrating like an energy that surrounded her.</p><p>Beside her, she heard James inhale sharply.</p><p>The twinkling disappeared altogether. "My apologies, Mrs. Potter."</p><p>Hermione looked down at the invite. She turned it over a few times and but did not break the seal. Instead, she passed it back to Dumbledore.</p><p>"No thank you," she said, as politely as she could. Her tone was still cool, and both James and Dumbledore could tell.</p><p>"I am planning on stopping at Sirius's after this to invite his brother," began Dumbledore, carefully. "Mr. Regulus Black will be offered the same opportunity based on his experiences that night. Afterward, I plan on speaking to Mr. Crouch as well—"</p><p>"They'll say 'no' as well," interrupted Hermione calmly. She <em>knew</em> her friends.</p><p>"Because you will tell them so?" asked Dumbledore shrewdly.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "Because they're not interested. You can tell them of this conversation, too, if you'd like. I don't need to dictate what my friends do."</p><p>"But they do follow you," pointed out Dumbledore, his eyes narrowing the tiniest bit.</p><p>Hermione shrugged, pointing at herself. "Ravenclaw. We tend to have good ideas."</p><p>James closed his eyes and turned slightly away so neither Hermione nor Dumbledore could see his face. He had a hand covering his mouth.</p><p>"I see." Dumbledore sighed. He used his wand to vanish his teacup and teapot, and then slowly stood. "I am disappointed, of course, but I do not force people to join the fight if they do not want to."</p><p>Hermione held back a snort; she was <em>neck-deep</em> in the fight!</p><p>"I'll show you out, Headmaster," said James, rising to his feet. He cast Hermione a look that read <em>we're talking when I get back</em> but turned to the wizard and led him from the room. Hermione went back to the kitchen, wand already out and frantically swishing to get the neglected spoon to begin stirring the sauce again.</p><p>James appeared a few moments later, staring at her from where he leaned against the kitchen doorway. His arms were crossed, but he wasn't closed off; there was something curious in his brown eyes as they followed her around the kitchen, despite the neutral look he wore.</p><p>"Do you wanna tell me why you declined the offer?"</p><p>Hermione glanced at her from the stove, the steam from the pasta pot curling her hair. "Do I have to?"</p><p>James grimaced. "No… but I like to think that I'd understand your reasons if you do want to share them with me."</p><p>"Why do <em>you</em> think I said no?" asked Hermione curiously, turning from the stove.</p><p>"Oh – uh – I dunno," blinked James, wrongfooted. "I, uh, I guess you don't want to be involved because of the kidnapping?"</p><p>Hermione slowly shook her head.</p><p>James frowned. "Then why?"</p><p>She bit her lip, glancing away. Finally, she turned back to the sauce, adding the neglected chopped vegetables, and said, quietly. "I don't trust Dumbledore."</p><p>James slipped from where he was leaning against the wall, completely surprised by her admission. He caught himself on the frame instead, hauling him upright. "You don't trust <em>Dumbledore</em>?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "I don't like how he handled things after the… Shrieking Shack."</p><p>James made a pained noise.</p><p>"And there were things that I saw, as a Ravenclaw, that you wouldn't see from your end of things," she continued carefully. "He plays favourites."</p><p>James frowned, stepping further into the kitchen. He caught her eyes and held him in his gaze until he was within touching distance. He reached out and gently took her hands in his. "Hermione…" he began, glancing down and then back up at her. "Look – I – don't take this the wrong way, okay?"</p><p>"What—"</p><p>"I know you're not telling me the truth—"</p><p>Indignation rose in Hermione. "I am telling the truth!"</p><p>"Okay, then the <em>full</em> truth," amended James quickly, tightening his grip on her hands. "I know you're not sharing everything with me."</p><p>Hermione swallowed thickly. Had she messed up somewhere…?</p><p>"I'm not going to ask you to tell me," continued James. He quirked a grin at her. "Not yet at least. I'll be patient."</p><p>Cautiously, Hermione ventured, "You might be waiting a while."</p><p>James wriggled his eyebrows. "I think we both know how patient I can be when I want, Hermione. And we <em>both</em> know that when I want something, I go after it with everything I have. But I'm also not going to push you to tell me if you're not comfortable with telling me."</p><p>Hermione's mouth dropped open.</p><p>"I'll admit," continued James, hurt creeping into his voice, "That I don't like that you're keeping secrets from me. It hurts that you feel like you can't trust me—"</p><p>"Regulus, Barty, and I have been working together on our own to stop Voldemort," blurted out Hermione, half-horrified that she just spat it out like that, and half-relieved that she was no longer keeping it secret from James.</p><p>James blinked. Then, he squeaked, "I beg your pardon?"</p><p><em>Well, in for a penny,</em> thought Hermione. "We've… we've been working on this since we were in fifth year."</p><p>"I beg your pardon?!" James's voice rose higher, even as his eyes widened further. His hands clenched around hers.</p><p>"Things are kind of up in the air, right now, but I think we're going to start a business together and use it as a front for continuing our work," added Hermione in a rush, almost shaking James's hands. "Reg inherited his uncle's shop – the Haberdashery – and with Alphard's old contacts, and between what Barty can find out through his father – and my skills – well, we've been doing alright?"</p><p>James looked like Hermione had just told him she was in love with Snape and was leaving him for the greasy git. "I – and this – <em>fifth year</em>?"</p><p>Hermione nodded slowly.</p><p>James took a step back, and Hermione let his hands slip from hers. He didn't go further, though, just a foot away and staring at her. His brows furrowed. "I – I don't understand – why wouldn't you want to pool resources with the Order…?"</p><p>Hermione gripped her arms, curling a bit in on herself. "As I said," she mumbled, "I just don't trust him."</p><p>James was silent, and Hermione felt the weight of his eyes on her. Behind, on the stove, the sauce bubbled and popped.</p><p>Eventually, James let out a loud exhale. Hermione looked up at him. "James…?"</p><p>"Hermione," he sighed, looking up at their ceiling and then shaking his head. "I love you. Nothing will ever change that."</p><p>Hermione's knees wobbled in relief. She reached out blindly, grasping the side of the counter to keep herself upright. James's warm hazel eyes landed on her and he gave her a tiny grin.</p><p>"I – I know that Gryffindors tend to get Dumbledore's attention more than anyone else, so maybe you don't know him as well as I do… so while I don't understand why you won't join the Order, I respect your decision," he finished.</p><p>"James!" Hermione beamed at him, launching herself at him and hugging him tight around the neck. She laughed wetly into his neck even as his glasses cut into her temple.</p><p>James gripped her back just as tightly. "I won't be able to tell you what I get up to. But I want you to share what you feel comfortable with, with me; and I'll do the same."</p><p>"I promise!" replied Hermione, drawing back but staying in the circle of his arms.</p><p>"Me too," he murmured, nose brushing hers. Then he drew back further, and said, a bit sternly, "Just – just don't get arrested, okay? I'm not sure how I could explain away that one with my colleagues in the Department…"</p><p>Hermione laughed.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>October 1979</strong>
</p><p>Despite the carriages being <em>the exact same</em> – minus the wood accents and a bit more metal and chrome – the train Hermione, Regulus, Petunia, and Sean departed on from King's Cross looked remarkably like the Hogwarts Express. And yet, Regulus kept moving gingerly around the space, perching himself on the very edge of his seat and using an embroidered handkerchief to touch things.</p><p>"You're such a snob," teased Hermione as she flopped in the seat next to him.</p><p>"If you don't want to be here, mate," began Sean as he took the seat opposite Regulus, "Then why'd you come?"</p><p>"Was James not available?" asked Petunia pointedly, glancing at her sister as she sat, clutching her large tote bag to her chest.</p><p>"Or Barty?" added Sean.</p><p>Regulus and Hermione shared a look. Hermione shook her head when she turned back to her sister and brother-in-law. "Barty's dad has him shadowing him at the Ministry. He wants him to join the Aurors, but we'd rather just go in business together at the Haberdashery."</p><p>Sean made a face.</p><p>"And James?" pressed Petunia, narrowing her eyes the tiniest.</p><p>Hermione squirmed. "He uh… vaguely knows… what we are going to do… but he's at work today. Obviously. That's why he couldn't come."</p><p>Regulus turned in his seat to face Hermione, his eyes wide. "James <em>knows</em>?!"</p><p>"<em>Noooo</em>," drawled Hermione, glaring at Regulus and hoping he'd keep quiet. The train left the station, jerking the tiniest bit before moving out through the heavy tracks and urban center. "Not quite."</p><p>"Excuse me," bit out Petunia, glaring at Hermione. The two looked eerily similar, despite the difference in hair and colour: the way their eyes were slit, the flaring of their nostrils, and the pursing of their lips were the same.</p><p>Sean's eyebrows popped up and he sat back, crossing his arms. "Blimey, this ought to be good," he muttered, catching Regulus's eye.</p><p>The train turned north and began to move out of the urban area into suburban, colours flashing by as it picked up speed, mixing the browns and greens against the early morning and bright blue sky.</p><p>"Tuney…" began Hermione, mumbling a bit as she tried to placate her older sister. "It's uh – it's not like that—"</p><p>"Then what is it like, Hermione?" asked Petunia sharply. "Because it sounds like you asked Sean and me to help you with your Tom Riddle problem for a weekend excursion, and yet your <em>husband</em> doesn't know what you're up to."</p><p>"He kind of knows," she muttered, looking away and out the window, although that meant looking past Regulus who was staring at her.</p><p>"'He kind of knows,'" mimicked Petunia nastily, "Is not the same as knowing and thinking this is a good idea. <em>What</em> did you get us involved in?"</p><p>Hermione slid down the seat a bit and hunched her shoulders. "You won't have to do much – Reg and I will do the work –"</p><p>"Oh, oh <em>no</em>," interrupted Petunia, a heavy frown on her face. "You are going to tell us. We've got a four-hour train ride, so best start talking."</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "Too public."</p><p>The other three glanced around the carriage and the three businessmen, the two couples, a group of uni students looking very bleary and hungover, and then back at Hermione.</p><p>Petunia spoke through gritted teeth. "<em>Fine</em>. You and I are going to have a chat, later when we get to Little Hangleton, then, miss."</p><p>Hermione slouched further down the seat. "Erm. Okay," she mumbled, her chin touching her chest even as she thought: <em>God, she makes me feel six instead of nineteen. I'm bloody married!</em></p><p>Sean eyed her, brows raised, before shaking his head and turning to the window. Petunia considered the matter closed and retrieved a bawdy romance novel from her tote to read, ignoring everyone around her as she opened the book.</p><p>Regulus looked at Hermione, then Petunia, and shook his head. "You're on your own," he muttered and turned to look out the window as well, with his arms crossed.</p><p>Hermione sighed.</p><hr /><p>The four stood on an empty train platform after the train left, looking around at the abandoned ticket station and rotted wooden sign that proclaimed "Little Hangleton", barely hanging on to the roof by a single, rusted chain; they had taken a transfer from Greater Hangleton an hour earlier on a smaller train, and by the look on Petunia's pinched face, she was <em>not</em> amused. Sean's glower was aligned to that of his wife's.</p><p>"Well," began Regulus in false cheer, drawing everyone's attention. "Maybe we should find a place to stay?"</p><p>"If there is something," muttered Petunia, but the four pushed through the passthrough at the station and turned down the gravel path to the village, nestled alongside the train station at the bottom of the valley.</p><p>There was a low-lying fog that swirled around their legs as they walked, and the looming bare branches of the trees that lined the path arched over them. Leaves crunched under their boots, and the lights from Little Hangleton appeared distant and muted despite not being that far away.</p><p>Distantly, Hermione saw the monstrosity of the Riddle Manor at the top of the valley hill, overlooking the village and station. It was dark and ruinous. The shadows from the afternoon autumn sun – already low in the sky – created long, twisting shadows of the manor's wings and angled roofs, lengthening as they drew her eyes toward the church. Adjacent to the manor property, it had a single steeple and the patch of land at the top of the valley that was the graveyard.</p><p>A single, wooden sign, a makeshift arrow, noted the graveyard in faded paint as the four reached a fork in the gravel road.</p><p>Toward the graveyard, the trees began to thicken and duplicate in number, creating a tiny forest of thick, leafy foliage despite the late season. But there was something heavy and dank in the air that made Hermione shudder.</p><p>"This place is really creepy," muttered Sean, inching away from the path, and closer to the village. "Can we go?"</p><p>Regulus and Hermione shared a glance; down that path was not just the route to the Riddle House, but potentially the Gaunt house, too. It would explain the atmosphere and feeling of ill will.</p><p>"Later," mouthed Hermione, and Regulus nodded.</p><p>Quickening their pace, the group made their way into Little Hangleton barely twenty minutes later, and Sean sussed out a B&amp;B with a "vacancy" sign. Turning to face the group, he jerked his thumb over his shoulder and began walking backward, even as he said, "Um, yeah. So. I'm going to get us two rooms…"</p><p>Petunia stared hard at him for a long, long minute, and then turned to Regulus and Hermione. Before she could say anything, Hermione blurted, "We're going to go scout the town! Yeah!"</p><p>Regulus glanced at Hermione, then wisely kept his mouth shut, moving a few steps away from her and Petunia.</p><p>Petunia ground her teeth – making Hermione cringe – but nodded. "I guess I can talk to some of the townspeople. We can meet up at the pub in a bit."</p><p>Exhaling, Hermione sent a wobbly grin at her older sister. "That sounds great! Thanks, Tuney!"</p><p>She spun on her heel and made it two steps before Petunia reached out and grabbed Hermione's arm, tight. She whipped her sister around and, with narrowed eyes, hissed at Hermione, "Just because you're walking away right now doesn't mean we're done talking! Don't go and do anything stupid like – like – getting yourself blown up!"</p><p>"Blown up?" echoed Hermione in amusement. "Just what do you think I'm going to do?"</p><p>Petunia huffed and threw her hands in the air. "I don't know Hermione, I'm not a witch, am I?"</p><p>"It'll be fine, Tuney," soothed Hermione. "We're just going to poke our noses around. Right, Reg?"</p><p>Regulus held both his hands up in the gesture of <em>don't get me involved in this</em>.</p><p>"Fine," sighed Petunia, after a moment. "Two hours. Pub. Don't be late."</p><p>"Yes, mum," agreed Hermione, and Petunia stopped away, hitching her tote bag up further on her shoulder even as she threw her shoulders back and tossed her long blonde hair over her shoulder. Immediately, they watched as she honed in on a lone woman outside the grocer's, and the way her winsome smile and journalist persona came to the forefront.</p><p>Soon, the two women were talking animatedly.</p><p>Regulus gave a low whistle. "Merlin, she's good."</p><p>"Let's see if we're just as good at Riddle Manor," replied Hermione.</p><hr /><p>They weren't. The Manor wasn't quite as dilapidated as Hermione had anticipated, but it was boarded up and dusty and had a vague smell of mold. But it was also obvious that no one had been inside – magical or otherwise – for decades.</p><p>Regulus and Hermione returned to the B&amp;B, meeting Petunia outside. She had their room numbers and keys and led them up the dark staircase to the second floor and their rooms, which shared an adjoining sitting area. Sean was waiting for them, with take-out.</p><p>"It's not very flavourful," he mourned as he handed out newspaper-wrapped fish and chips, "Because this is about as exotic as Little Hangleton gets."</p><p>Petunia snorted into her chips, dousing them with vinegar. "This place is a <em>cesspool</em>," she declared. "The people are distrustful, petty, and suspicious."</p><p>"But you seemed to be chatting up that Muggle woman when we left," pointed out Regulus in confusion, brows furrowed even as he absently bit into his salted chip. He made a face.</p><p>"Sure, for a bit," sighed Petunia. "And then when I mentioned I was investigating suspicious deaths in small towns of Northern England – I even had <em>other</em> research to back me up! – she got all shirty with me. Spat something out about 'poor old Frank,' and then left in a huff."</p><p>"What about you two?" asked Sean, glancing between Hermione and Regulus.</p><p>"Bust," sighed Hermione, putting down her newspaper bundle in her lap. "The Manor is mostly boarded up, but whatever happened there years ago with the Riddles, it's faded magic."</p><p>"Nice house though," added Regulus, dabbing his paper napkin against the corner of his mouth. He then pushed away his finished fish – having left the chips. "A bit small."</p><p>Petunia and Sean stared at him. Then, Sean turned to Petunia, sputtering, "<em>A bit small?!</em>"</p><p>Hermione stifled a grin, but it called Petunia's attention to her. Hermione felt a frisson of something sizzle up her spine and she gulped as her sister's blue eyes locked onto her.</p><p>"So, Hermione," Petunia began, putting her own meal down, "Do you want to explain things now?"</p><p>"Not particularly," muttered Hermione, looking away.</p><p>"Tough," spat Petunia, leaning forward toward Hermione. "Explain why James doesn't know what's going on. Explain what <em>is</em> going on – why you need so much information about Tom Riddle and why we're here."</p><p>Hermione shared a glance with Regulus, who shrugged. "It's your story to tell, Hermione."</p><p>Hermione scowled. "I thought you'd want me to keep quiet."</p><p>"I do," agreed Regulus evenly, "But because your sister and her husband are Muggles and can't protect themselves if someone finds out they know. Barty and I can. And we have."</p><p>"Does this have something to do with your kidnapping in July?" Petunia's eyes narrowed even as Sean leaned back and observed them with a casual air, although his eyes followed each person speaking with careful consideration.</p><p>"Kind of," sighed Hermione, turning back to her sister. She looked at Petunia for a long moment, taking in her sister's confidence, the ease she held herself.</p><p><em>She's already implicated herself by helping us with the information on Riddle from the Muggle side of things…</em> thought Hermione, twisting her lips a little in a side-frown. <em>She's already in danger by virtue of being my sister and an Evans.</em></p><p>"I don't think you're going to believe me," began Hermione carefully, looking at both Petunia and Sean as she spoke. "But bear with me…"</p><p>"Okay…" said Petunia, her mouth pulling down in a frown.</p><p>"I was born Hermione Granger on September nineteenth, in 1979, and died in 2026 at the age of forty-seven…"</p><p>Hermione gave a watered-down version of her life, and then recapped how she grew up an Evans, her time at Hogwarts, and then what she knew of Tom Riddle, the Dark Lord Voldemort – including why she was in Little Hangleton with Regulus, hunting for artifacts. James and his original fate were also touched upon – although she kept the information about his wife secret for now (that was something she would share with Petunia when it was just the two of them) – and how she wanted to change things.</p><p>At the end of the discussion, Petunia was blinking back tears, having migrated to sit next to Hermione – pushing Regulus out of his seat on the couch – and holding her sister tight. Sean, sitting opposite them, sighed heavily and hung his hands between his legs with his elbows braced by his knees. He shook his head and said, despondently, "Just when I think I'm getting the hang of magic, you throw something like this at me, Hermione."</p><p>Hermione gave a tiny, wet laugh.</p><p>"Welcome to my life, mate," replied Regulus, turning to Sean. "Try growing up with her when she used to do weird things for weird reasons and Barty and I would have <em>no idea</em> why she was doing it."</p><p>"Shut up, Reggie," muttered Hermione, grabbing one of his cold, leftover chips and throwing it at him. The wizard squealed as it neared him, twisting out of the way and then loudly berating Hermione for throwing the potato at him, storming off to the bedroom to change his shirt, muttering about salt stains. Sean followed, laughing, leaving the two sisters alone.</p><p>"You're going to have to tell James eventually, Hermione," said Petunia quietly.</p><p>"I know," said Hermione, her shoulders falling.</p><p>"Soon," pressed Petunia. Her eyes were wide and imploring as she stared at Hermione. She squeezed her tightly, for a moment.</p><p><em>I know</em>, thought Hermione, shivering a bit.</p><hr /><p>"So, if the manor had nothing, where are we going?" asked Sean, the first the speak the next day as the four of them, dressed in trousers and jackets, left Little Hangleton and headed back to the fork in the road by the train station.</p><p>Hermione made Sean carry a transfigured shovel but had cast a featherlight charm on it. Petunia carried her tote bag again, but this time was rereading the note she sent Hermione, thumbing through the pages quickly as she caught herself up on Tom Riddle. Regulus, leading them, nervously kept touching his hidden wand holster up his sleeve, casting wary glances around the gravel path.</p><p>"Because if you say, 'grave robbing,'" continued Sean with a scrunched face, "I'm out."</p><p>Hermione snorted. "No grave robbing." <em>Not tonight, anyway.</em> "But there's a chance we might need to dig around the Gaunt property."</p><p>"Gaunt?" asked Petunia, looking up from the notes. "Riddle's… mother, I'm guessing? A witch?"</p><p>"A squib," corrected Regulus, a rather serious look on his face as they neared the fork. "Someone born to two magical users but has no magic themselves. The opposite of a Muggleborn."</p><p>"The Gaunts were well-known in Pureblood circles until the turn of the century," added Hermione, explaining for Sean and Petunia's benefit. "Very inbred, very Dark. There's likely to be some types of traps around the property that had nothing to do with Riddle himself, so you two will stay back and let us do the heavy wand work."</p><p>"Fine by me," agreed Sean with a rather cheerful skip now that he knew he wasn't graverobbing. "Honestly, this is exciting…"</p><p>Petunia shot him a disbelieving look.</p><p>The group turned down the fork toward the Riddle house and the graveyard, but barely a minute into the heavily wooded area, both Hermione and Regulus stopped and shivered violently.</p><p>"What?" Petunia's voice rose in panic. "What's wrong?"</p><p>Slightly green in the face, Hermione replied, "Magic. It's really…"</p><p>"Inky," finished Regulus, gagging. "Similar to the Horcrux, but that's not it. There's decades of Dark magic in this forest."</p><p>"Wonderful," bit out Petunia, inching closer to Sean.</p><p>Hermione and Regulus shared a look, and then turned off the trail, to a small, overgrown one that they only seemed to see. Petunia followed Hermione, and Sean brought up the rear until they reached a clearing with a very rundown shack in the middle.</p><p>"No Muggle repellant," muttered Regulus, his eyes flicking everywhere. "I don't like that."</p><p>"Same," muttered Hermione in reply, glancing back at Petunia and Sean – the latter who was swinging his shovel around idly, careful not to hit his wife, and whistling. Hermione grimaced.</p><p>Regulus inched closer, his wand tip glowing brightly as he muttered under his breath revealing spells and poking around at moments to check for other wards. Closer to the door he stopped a heavy scowl of distaste on his face. "Hermione! Come look at this."</p><p>Leaving Petunia and Sean near the treeline, Hermione carefully picked her way across the weedy and leaf-covered ground, stepping where Regulus stepped until she was next to him. She looked up at the door and went, "Eww," without thinking about it.</p><p>The skeleton of a snake rung from a single, rusty nail, in mockery of a charm or wreath, either end coming just below the frame. It was also pulsing a faint, sickly yellow until Regulus's wand.</p><p>"Spell?" asked Hermione. Distantly, she saw Petunia and Sean move along the tree line that surrounded the property, moving clockwise.</p><p>"Keyed to a Parselmouth, I think," answered Regulus slowly, flicking his wand. Immediately, bits of the sickly yellow lifted from the snake and coalesced into smoky swirls and patterns and runes that Hermione recognized.</p><p>"Key rune is there," she said, pointing at the floating Peorð symbol, ᛈ, as the lynchpin to the ward entry.</p><p>"What does it mean?" asked Regulus, who took arithmancy, not ancient runes.</p><p>"The Gaunts liked to play games," answered Hermione grimly. "It means hidden secrets, destiny, uncertainty. 'A source of recreation and amusement to the great'," she finished with a soft quote.</p><p>Regulus echoed her snort. "Wankers."</p><p>"Unless we want him to know what we're doing, we're going to need to find another way that isn't the front door," muttered Regulus, lowering his wand.</p><p>"There's a window back here!" shouted Petunia from the other side of the shack.</p><p>Regulus and Hermione exchanged a look and followed, coming around the shack to see Petunia and Sean still near the treeline, but this time, Petunia was on Sean's back, piggyback style, and slightly higher than eye-level to investigate a window – really, a gaping hole – that had only shutters and no glass. The elements could go directly into the building without any barriers.</p><p>Regulus had his wand work and went through the same checks as the front door, only to lower his wand shortly after.</p><p>"Nothing," he said, eyes wide and with wonder coating his voice. "Not a single spell!"</p><p>"I guess wizards think everyone will use the door," teased Petunia as Sean helped her down.</p><p>"Guess so," replied Regulus, in a daze. He shook his head, putting his wand in his sheath. He turned to Hermione, already lacing his fingers together. "Shall I give you a boost up?"</p><p>Hermione nodded, hands on Regulus's shoulder even as he crouched. She put the toe of her foot into the hollow his hands made and scrambled to get a purchase on the window ledge when he boosted her up. She then hauled herself up and toppled head-first, ass over teakettle, into the shack, landing on a moldy pile of discarded laundry that smelled like piss and shit.</p><p>"Ow," she whined.</p><p>"You okay in there?" shouted Regulus.</p><p>"Fine!" she shouted back, moving away from the pile and making a face as she tried to scrub her dirty hands on already dirty trousers. "Your turn!"</p><p>She was <em>not</em> going to tell him what was going to soften his landing.</p><p>Regulus entered next, landing where she did.</p><p>"Oh, gross!" he spat, springing up immediately. Unlike her, though, he remembered he was a wizard and cast <em>scourgify</em>. Hermione hastily, and embarrassedly, followed, ignoring Regulus's smirk.</p><p>The shack was only three rooms: a large living and eating space, a washroom of some kind, and perhaps a single bedroom, although that part of the wall had collapsed, and the door was missing. They had fallen into the living area, opposite the front door, just next to an open arch that led to a large bathtub and porcelain washbasin. The pile of laundry they landed on would have come from the large washing tub, left in a pile for the wash.</p><p>With a shared grimace, Regulus began checking the room for spells and deftly bringing them up for Hermione to spot; she followed behind him as he moved, finding the keys in each spell as they deconstructed them, and then, together, they dismantled the interior wards: a flesh-stripping spell on the second floorboard beyond the front door; a blood-boil curse on the oil lantern; a withering curse on the bedroom wall that wasn't collapsed.</p><p>Once the two were sure they got everything, including dismantling the door ward from the inside, did they call Sean and Petunia in.</p><p>"Are we going to put them back up?" asked Regulus quietly.</p><p>"Before we leave, we'll work backward," confirmed Hermione, just as quietly, when Petunia eased into the room and made a loud sound of disgust, bringing a hand up to cover her nose.</p><p>Sean whistled lowly. "Wow, what died in here?"</p><p>"Hermione's dignity," snickered Regulus, pointing at the dirty streak on her trousers that the <em>scourgify</em> couldn't remove.</p><p>"Fuck you," she said dryly.</p><p>"So… where's this… <em>Horcrux</em>?" asked Sean, carefully pronouncing the foreign word.</p><p>Regulus pointed at the second floorboard, which had the flesh-stripping spell on it. "He wanted it close to the door because anyone who made it through would probably think it was hidden further in."</p><p>"Not a bad idea," agreed Sean, crouching by the floorboard. "Anything else on this?"</p><p>"We got rid of the spell," answered Hermione, carefully stepping around <em>what</em> the spell was.</p><p>"And you want this to look like no one was here, right?" confirmed Sean, looking up at her and Regulus.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>"Great. Pet, hand me the screwdriver," commanded Sean, pulling on a thick pair of workman's gloves.</p><p>The three came to a loose circle around him as he wedged the screwdriver tip between the two floorboards and began wiggling it back and forth. After a few tense moments, he popped the floorboard and nails on one side, and then quickly shuffled to the other end to do the same with the other side of the board. Then, he lifted the rotted board up, revealing a hollow crawlspace below.</p><p>"I'm pretty sure I saw a horror film that had a scene like this, once," said Petunia quietly.</p><p>Hermione sent her sister a withering glare. "<em>Thanks</em>, Tuney, that was <em>just</em> what we all needed to hear right now."</p><p>"So long as we don't split up," said Sean cheerfully, even as he carefully set the floorboard to the side, nails pointed away from them. "They always do that in the movies, and then get brutally murdered!"</p><p>Regulus looked sick. "Muggles have strange entertainment."</p><p>"Well, excuse me," said Petunia, tilting her nose up the tiniest amount. "But whatever is down there, it just <em>feels</em> evil."</p><p>Regulus stared at her. "You can… feel something?"</p><p>Hermione blinked in surprise. "Tuney… you're sensing <em>magic</em>. The Horcrux."</p><p>"I <em>am</em>?" asked Petunia, mouth open as she looked between the two. Then, she looked down at the dark crawlspace and shuddered. "<em>That's</em> what evil magic feels like?"</p><p>"What does it feel like?" asked Sean curiously.</p><p>Petunia wrapped her arms around herself and shivered again. "Like… being constantly cold. The kind of bad, cold ache you get when you can't warm up after a frigid day. Like you're ready to burst into tears for no reason and don't think you'll ever stop – like you're not good enough for <em>anyone</em> and you'll be alone f-forever – and you'll just sink into a p-pit of d-despair and anger and j-jealousy because your sisters are better than you at <em>everything</em>—"</p><p>She broke off on a choking sob, alarming Sean.</p><p>"That's the Horcrux!" cried Hermione, "She's being affected by it! Sean, take her outside, <em>now</em>!"</p><p>Sean nodded once and caught Petunia around her waist, bodily lifting her as her face crumpled and she began crying against his neck, wrapping her arms tight around her husband. Sean moved quickly to the door and then all the way to the treeline from what they could see, murmuring to Petunia as she calmed the further away, she was from the Horcrux.</p><p>"Bastard," muttered Regulus darkly, using a <em>lumos</em> to peer into the darkness of the crawlspace. At the bottom was a tiny velvet pouch, which he summoned with an <em>accio</em>. Neither touched the pouch, Hermione instead manipulating it with <em>wingardium leviosa</em> to twist the pouch until the opening as at the bottom.</p><p>A gold ring with a black onyx gem fell. There was a single <em>ping</em> of metal hitting the floorboard and then another as it bounced and came to a rest between the two magical users. The metal glinted off the <em>lumos</em> from Regulus's wand.</p><p>"That's it," he said, mouth pulled tight into a frown.</p><p>Hermione nodded and pulled out the vial of basilisk venom. The bottle was barely half-full now, after destroying several Horcruxes. Hermione held it out to him, in invitation. "Your turn?"</p><p>Regulus nodded, handing Hermione his wand. The light dimmed the tiniest amount as she took it, and then pulsed a bit brighter when she sent some of her own magic into his wand.</p><p>The wizard rolled his sleeves up, unstopped the vial, and then hovered above it for a moment – and then the Horcrux <em>wailed</em>, a swirl of dark greyish, malevolent smoke burst from it, sweeping up leaves, debris, and dirt inside the shack. The <em>lumos</em> from the wand barely penetrated the smoke, blocking Petunia and Sean from Hermione's sight.</p><p>It formed a tall man, around Sean's age; it was Tom Riddle, older, with slicked-back hair and a cruel gleam to his eyes, which flashed red. "<em>You dare, you filthy blood traitor!</em>"</p><p>He took a step forward, a snarl on his face. "<em>You dare bring Muggles to destroy </em>me<em>? You are a traitor to all wizard-kind! You will be disowned, disavowed Black – you will have your nails ripped, your flesh stripped, you very being cursed as you—</em>"</p><p>"DO IT NOW, REGULUS!" shouted Hermione, bringing an arm up to block the dirt from getting into her eyes.</p><p>What Riddle was saying wasn't anything he hadn't heard before – things Sirius had heard his entire life. If his brother could take what was dished out, <em>so could he</em>.</p><p>"Brave like Sirius," he whispered to himself and then tipped the rest of the bottle over the ring.</p><p>Riddle howled as the venom hit the onyx gem and burned down and around the casing, into the gold. The smoky visage of Tom Riddle burst at once, sending a shockwave of dirt and debris to all corners of the room and leaving Hermione's curly hair a mess with streaks of grey in it from the dust.</p><p>Regulus looked worse, like a bag of flour in washed-out grey had exploded in his face. His wavy hair was almost sticking up on end, and he looked more like James with his messy hair.</p><p>But the Horcrux was gone, with just the stone left. Whatever curse that was on it previously had been eaten up by the venom, but to be sure, Hermione grabbed Regulus's hand as he reached for it, using his wand to test for anything insidious lingering.</p><p>When the spells came back clean, she let go of his hand and he picked up the gem with one hand and took his wand back with the other, doing a doubletake at the gem when the light of his wand hit it a certain way.</p><p>"Hermione," he breathed, eyes flicking back and forth between her and the gem, "Is – is this – what I think it is?"</p><p>He angled the gem so she could see the triangle and bisecting line in it.</p><p>She bit her lip and slowly nodded.</p><p>He exhaled, loudly. "This is a –"</p><p>"ARE YOU TWO OKAY?" shouted Sean, interrupting them.</p><p>"Can you <em>please</em> come out now?!" added Petunia, plaintively.</p><p>Regulus closed his fist around the gem, keeping it in his hand even as he began to build back up the spells Riddle had cast. Hermione used the discarded tools Sean and Petunia had dropped from her tote bag to put the floorboard back in place, even using the hammer on the nails.</p><p>By the time she was done, so was Regulus, and he added the flesh-stripping spell to the board as the last from the inside; they exited the shack together, and he added the spell to the door and snake, hoping that no one would notice how much weaker his Dark spells were than what had originally been there. Perhaps – if Voldemort came to check – he would think the spells eroded over time.</p><p>"You're both so <em>dirty</em>!" cried Petunia, reaching for her handkerchief, and wetting it with her mouth. She reached for Hermione and hauled her close, using the wet corner on her sister's cheek.</p><p>"<em>Ohmigod, Tuney</em>!" cried Hermione, squirming and trying to wriggle her way out of Petunia's tight grip. "I'm <em>nineteen</em>! You can't just do that to me!"</p><p>"Hold still, you've got a spot here," her sister muttered, ignoring her.</p><p>"What's that, mate?" asked Sean, pointing at the rock in Regulus's open palm as he stared down at it.</p><p>The teenager jerked, startled. He glanced at Sean, then Petunia, and finally a mulish Hermione who had submitted to her sister's mothering. "It's… it's a Deathly Hallow."</p><p>"A what now?" asked Sean, frowning.</p><p>"It's… from a wizarding fairy-tale," began Regulus, slowly. He seemed unsure. "About three brothers who cheated Death."</p><p>"So, someone made a token from the fairy-tale?" asked Petunia, letting Hermione go. "Like… maybe how we make gingerbread houses like in <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>? Or the phrase, 'if the shoe fits' for Cinderella?"</p><p>"The story says that anyone who has possession of all three Hallows becomes the Master of Death." He looked at the gem. "Grindelwald searched for these during his reign as a Dark Lord during the war. Apparently, he had a wand – the Death stick, the Elder wand. People <em>worship</em> the Hallows. I've seen tokens and icons to them, especially in Dark households, but… this <em>feels</em> different."</p><p>Unsurely, Regulus glanced at Hermione. Petunia and Sean looked at her, too, and she sighed, running a hand through her very unruly hair.</p><p>"It's the real deal," she said quietly. "Harry had all three in the future. I'm not sure if they ever did anything for him by the Battle of Hogwarts, but he had everything: the wand, the resurrection stone, and the cloak."</p><p>Regulus's eyes narrowed. "A cloak? Like… an <em>invisibility</em> cloak that Potter owns?"</p><p>Hermione's eyes rolled skyward – absently noting that the sun was going down – how <em>long</em> had they been in the shack?! – so she didn't have to answer.</p><p>"Cloak, stone," muttered Regulus, staring back at the deceptive onyx gem in his hand, "And a wand… that Grindelwald last had…" He groaned. "Dumbledore's got the wand, hasn't he?"</p><p>Hermione did not answer that, but it was enough that Regulus groaned again.</p><p>"I don't get it," said Sean, looking at Regulus and Hermione. "What's so special about these Hallows?"</p><p>"Legend says that whoever owns all three is the Master of Death," explained Hermione, trying to hide the derision from her voice. "They have dominion over Death itself. The cloak can hide from death; the stone resurrects dead spirits for you to communicate with, and the wand is undefeatable."</p><p>"And Potter has the cloak?" added Sean, unsurely. He wasn't sure if he had followed that line from Regulus well, and he was still getting to know his sister-in-law better than vague family gatherings, but he was beginning to know her gestures and facial expressions. "And this is the stone?"</p><p>Petunia was staring at it. "How does it even <em>work</em>?"</p><p>"You turn the stone and think about who you want to contact from the other side," explained Hermione absently. "But Harry was never sure if it just brought shades that <em>looked</em> like who he wanted, who told him what he needed to hear – or if they were real."</p><p>"This is a journalists' dream," muttered Petunia, tearing her eyes from the stone, eventually. She shuddered and took a step back, away from it, and closer to Sean.</p><p>"Look, Hermione," began Sean, "If Potter has the cloak, and this is the stone thingy, then you should probably have it."</p><p>"What?" three voices cried out.</p><p>Sean held his hands up. "Hear me out. Even if it's not true – this whole Master of Death thing – it's worth having, right? A cloak that can hide you from anything, even death – and a stone that you can talk to the dead with? If this… uh, Dark Lord Tom—"</p><p>Regulus snorted because the idea of Lord Tom versus Lord Voldemort seemed far less dangerous and the name was beyond humiliating – he could kind of see how a teenaged Riddle wanted an anagram of his name for shock and awe.</p><p>"—had this, and learns of the other pieces, he might want them, right?" finished Sean.</p><p>"He's already split his soul to be immortal," added Petunia, feeling a bit better as she began to enthusiastically speak. "Being the Master of Death seems the next logical step."</p><p>Hermione bit her lip, staring at her sister and brother-in-law, and then Regulus. He wordlessly held out the hand with the stone on his palm.</p><p>"Take it," he urged. "It'll be safer with you than anyone else, Hermione. Keep it in the Potter line. The Potters were Peverells, you know."</p><p>"I know," she answered, voice soft. She knew. With a sigh, she took the stone, pocketing it and zipping the pocket up so it wouldn't accidentally disappear on her. The weight of the stone in her pocket was noticeable, for such a tiny thing, and Hermione felt more than the weight of the piece – she felt the weight of <em>expectation</em> and <em>destiny</em> on her.</p><p>"Well, I think that's about enough excitement for me," stated Sean, forcing a smile on his face as he brushed his hands together, dusting them off. "Shall we head back to the B&amp;B?"</p><p>The others gave a chorus of agreements; Petunia remained by the treeline with Hermione; Sean went to the back of the shack of Regulus, wand lighting the way, to pick up the forgotten and unused shovel. Once all their pieces were collected, and Regulus and Hermione did one last sweep to ensure all the spells were back up, they turned to trudge through the dark forest that surrounded the Gaunt shack at the bottom of the hill the Riddle manor lorded over.</p><p>They had only walked a bit in when a loud <em>snap</em> broke through the quiet of the forest.</p><p>Sean and Regulus immediately stopped – the two were at the front – causing Petunia to bump into her husband's back. "Ow, Sean, what—"</p><p>"<em>Sshh</em>!" chided Sean, not even glancing back. He and Regulus were looking around warily, and Hermione palmed her wand, turning so she was back-to-back with the two young men, Petunia sandwiched between them.</p><p><em>Crack</em>.</p><p>Hermione spun, facing the sound; Regulus had his wand up, pointed at the sound.</p><p><em>Snap</em>.</p><p>The third noise came from their other side, and Hermione pursed her lips, turning with Regulus so both, with wands out, were facing both sides. Sean gripped the shovel tightly.</p><p>Before Hermione, a pinprick of light spread into a bright halo. She blinked back spots that danced in front of her. The halo of light dimmed somewhat, and Hermione's mouth dropped open. Familiar burnt orange hair, a long face dusted with freckles, and that nose were as familiar to her as Harry's emerald eyes and messy black hair and scars.</p><p><em>Ron?</em> She wanted to ask, but the hard look on the wizard's face stopped her as he emerged from between two trees, absently brushing aside one low-hanging branch with brown leaves stubbornly clinging to it. A few fell at his action, one clinging to his dark trousers.</p><p>As familiar as the man seemed to Ron Weasley, there was something inherently more dangerous to him that reminded her a bit of Charlie, a bit of Moody. She wracked her brain, her barely-there memories, for who the Weasley man was.</p><p>"Well, well," he drawled, grip tightening on his wand. "What do we have here, Gid?"</p><p>"Two baby Death Munchers taking some unsuspecting Muggles for a stroll in the spooky, dark forest, Fab," replied the other masculine voice from Regulus's side, causing Hermione to turn her head a bit to see an identical looking man – although this one had longer, waver hair than the closely-cropped locks of the wizard before her.</p><p><em>Oh,</em> thought Hermione, realization crashing on her. Her knees wobbled even as her breath hitched. <em>Oh.</em></p><p><em>Gideon and Fabian Prewett</em>.</p><p>Then, her eyes widened. Gideon and Fabian Prewett – who were killed during the first wizarding war by Death Eaters.</p><p>"Oh, shit," slipped from her mouth, unbidden.</p><p>Fabian Prewett – the wizard holding his wand to light them up – gave a tiny smirk. "Oh shit, indeed, little witch. Now… why don't you step away from the Muggles, careful like, and put down your wands. So, we can have a little… <em>chat.</em>"</p><hr /><p align="center">{TBC...}</p>

      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>HPWiki says Gideon was alive until July 1981 at a minimum, due to taking a picture with Marlene McKinnon, but you know… artistic licensing at play here. There is also NO MENTION of their careers, so while fanon usually has them as Aurors, I’ve decided to change things up. I retroactively went back to my earlier chapter that had them as Aurors as well and removed that.</p><p>On my Tumblr, I have face-claims for many of these characters we don’t see or know about in canon (book and film). Feel free to pop by to look at them! These are part of my ongoing pureblood family tree, which is now up to approx. 1300 people!</p><p>Also had a review with someone upset that Hermione’s telling people the truth. I was surprised! In many time travel stories, the people closest to the time-traveling Hermione turn on her and get upset for not saving Lily, James, etc. when they finally learn she’s from the future if the secret is revealed. Well… what happens when she does or is actively doing something about it? When does she tell people ahead of these nail-biting situations? How does that change the story? What happens when people also know? Are they suddenly held responsible when things go wrong because of the knowledge they now have? </p><p>PS: props to those of you who caught the Hamilton reference last chapter 😉 As a reminder, the quotes at the beginning from TV shows and movies (all of which are excellent, so if you haven’t watched them yet, DO SO. Quarantine is the best time, after all…) are [mostly] relevant. Not just because I love them all or they’re about time travel.</p><p><b>Trigger warning</b>: graphic (?) death in the first section.</p></blockquote>

  <strong>October 1979</strong>
</p><p>Fabian Prewett – the wizard holding his wand to light them up – gave a tiny smirk. "Oh shit, indeed, little witch. Now… why don't you step away from the Muggles, careful like, and put down your wands. So, we can have a little… <em>chat.</em>"</p><p>Neither Hermione nor Regulus moved. Regulus, because he was glaring at Gideon Prewitt who <em>clearly</em> knew who he was (Dorea's genealogy lessons were paying off: Molly, Gideon, and Fabian's mother Lucretia Black was Regulus and Sirius's father's sister. They were cousins), given the hard stare the redhead was giving Hermione's friend.</p><p>For Hermione, though, she froze; Fabian and Gideon Prewitt were odd concepts of names and images of people she and her friends had never met nor heard much of except in some passing stories from Molly and Arthur. Harry had Fabian's watch, but the two were just another in a list of meaningless people who were part of the first Order of the Phoenix who died trying to stop Voldemort.</p><p>To see them, in the flesh, so to speak, was something Hermione did not anticipate. Caradoc Dearborn had been an anomaly, and with their escape, she hadn't paid much attention to him or even <em>spoke</em> to him. Fabian, however, was staring at her, waiting for her compliance or a reply.</p><p>Or, given that he thought she was a Death Eater, perhaps a spell or evil cackle. She wasn't too sure.</p><p>"Hermione… who are these wizards?" asked Petunia, quietly, from between her, Regulus, and Sean. She was clutching her tote bag tightly to her chest, staring equally as hard as Fabian was at them, although Petunia's eyes were narrowed, and her lips were pinched.</p><p>Fabian blinked, his wand falling a fraction. "Wizards…? You know about magic?"</p><p>Petunia's stare and facial expression easily broadcast how stupid she thought the wizard was. "Obviously."</p><p>"Then…" trailed off Fabian, looking from Hermione to Regulus and back to Petunia, "Who… why are you with Black?"</p><p>"He's my little sisters' <em>best friend</em>," bit out Petunia, stepping to brush her shoulder with Hermione, side-by-side in a show of solidarity. Hermione's heart beat faster, and she suddenly understood why Regulus didn't want her to tell Petunia and Sean – neither had wands, they were Muggles, what could they do against two older, Moody-trained wizards with wands and grudges? – but another part of her nearly burst with pride.</p><p>Fabian's wand lowered more. His blue eyes jerked over at Hermione.</p><p>"I don't believe this," burst out Gideon from behind. "He's a <em>Black</em>! This area is saturated with Dark magic – Fabe, c'mon, you don't <em>believe</em> this hippogriff dung, do you?"</p><p>"I might be a Black," interrupted Regulus scathingly, "But you also have a Black in your precious Order, don't you? Or has my brother's informal adoption by my great-aunt and her <em>Potter</em> husband made him greater than my family's value of an Ancient and Noble house?"</p><p>"Potter's are light-oriented folk," snapped Gideon, brows furrowed in anger.</p><p>"If that's the case, then there shouldn't be any worries here," added Sean carefully, shifting his weight a bit and tightening his grip on the shovel's handle as all eyes swung toward him.</p><p>"… what?" grit out Gideon.</p><p>Sean tipped his head in his sister-in-law's direction. "That's Hermione, my wife's sister. Who is married to James <em>Potter</em>."</p><p>Gideon's eyes darted to Hermione and she gave a tiny, limp-wristed wave from over her shoulder. "Hello."</p><p>"Oh," said Fabian, his wand lowering completely. "Well… um…"</p><p>"You're bloody <em>kidding</em>!" Gideon stared hard at Hermione. "What in Merlin's name are you doing out <em>here</em> of all places with Muggles?"</p><p>Hermione blinked innocently at him and gave her best doe-eyed look. "Sightseeing?"</p><p>"Pull the other one!" Fabian snorted, mouth twitching into the tiniest of smiles.</p><p>Petunia sighed. "I'm a journalist. I'm investigating an unsolved murder, and Hermione wanted to come along in case things went poorly. Of course, my husband was going to come along, and then Hermione thought it would be best if Regulus came as well since James is at work this weekend."</p><p><em>That was a good cover story,</em> thought Hermione proudly. It even hinted mostly at the truth!</p><p>Gideon was still suspicious, his eyes narrowed; Fabian, on the other hand, seemed to be taken by them and was even nodding along unconsciously. He peered over Hermione and Petunia to catch his brother's eyes.</p><p>"Gid, I really think that they're alright," he began. "They're not—"</p><p>"<em>Avada Kedavra!</em>"</p><p>Hermione pushed Petunia to her knees as a vivid green spell soared over her head, toward Fabian. Petunia screamed even as Fabian cursed loudly and threw himself behind a tree, his <em>lumos</em> failing. The clearing they were in plunged into darkness except for the bright green from the killing curse as he let the spell hit and shatter the trunk, sending woodchips and any stubbornly clinging leaves flying.</p><p>Regulus had his wand out and was conjuring a golden shield, Sean at his back and facing the other direction with Gideon already sending return spellfire in the direction of the killing curse. There was more multicolour spellfire from that direction, leaving Regulus and Gideon as the defenders and protecting Sean.</p><p>From in front of Hermione, a tall figure with a hood pulled low to their nose appeared from the darkness, between the twisting bare branches of the trees around them, already casting, his wand tip red and pulsing.</p><p>Hermione flicked her arm to the side, runes running up and down her jacket's sleeve, forming a long, glowing orange cuff with the runes rotating around the interlocking symbols and inside their individual banners. The orange illuminated her face just as the pulsing red from the wizard's wand eerily cast shadows under his hood.</p><p>The wizard let the spell fly, and Hermione brought her arm up to protect her face. The spell hit the runes with a loud <em>ping!</em>, shaking her arm, but it ricocheted off back at the wizard, who swore and dodged it. His hood fell, revealing a middle-aged man: very pale-faced, with dark curly hair, and a sharply blunted chin.</p><p>He scowled, and Fabian popped out from behind the tree and shouted, "<em>Expulso</em>!"</p><p>The man dodged the spell, laughing darkly. "Is that all you've got, Prewett? You really <em>are</em> just a glorified parchment-pusher!"</p><p>Fabian's face hardened, and he silently sent a spell at the man; he again, dodged, closer to Hermione. He didn't notice her, focused as he was on Fabian who lobbied another spell at him to dodge, and Hermione snapped her wand up in her other hand not covered by her runes, knocking him back with a knockback jinx.</p><p>It connected. He grunted as he tripped backward, slamming hard into a young tree that bent and then broke in half, sending him tumbling with his legs in the air.</p><p>"Oh, for Merlin's sake, Pyrites!" sneered the man fighting with Gideon, gasping for breath between his words. He apparated, his pop echoing loudly in the forest, and appeared next to the broken tree, reaching down to yank the fallen man up.</p><p>Regulus and Gideon whirled, Sean behind them, to face the two Death Eaters as a united front. Regulus's golden shield was providing enough light to illuminate the small area: the path she, Petunia, and Sean were on; some of the grass behind them and bush that Regulus and the Prewetts stood by, and the first row of thin trees the Death Eaters stood clustered around, like thick tree trunks themselves.</p><p>This man was not wearing a Death Eater mask; he had tanned skin, blond hair, and a hard, square face with narrow eyes. As it was, she didn't know either of the men – <em>they must only be for the higher-ranking members that Voldemort wants to protect from the public so no one knows who they are,</em> Hermione thought.</p><p>What she <em>did</em> know, was that between her, Regulus, Gideon, and Fabian, there were four wands and the Death Eaters only had two. This was not the night the Prewett brothers died, she realized with relief in her body, making her vaguely limp.</p><p>"Snyde," sneered Gideon, naming the other man. "Bit far from home, innit?"</p><p>"I could say the same to you, Prewett," the blond wizard bit, beady eyes darting over the large group. His sneer deepened when his eyes lingered on Petunia and Sean. "And consorting with the filth? What would your dear ol' mum have to say about that?"</p><p>"Oh, I don't know," interrupted Regulus, making the two Death Eaters look at him. "Auntie Lucretia was always a bit more open about her beliefs than mother's side of the Blacks."</p><p>Pyrites blinked; mouth open. "Regulus Black!"</p><p>"In the flesh," the younger wizard replied, dryly. "Now, I believe my cousins asked you what you were doing here."</p><p>Hermione bit back the smile that threatened to appear. Regulus publicly calling the Prewetts his cousins were more than just fact – it meant he was siding with them, a united stance against Voldemort's campaign in which the Blacks – Sirius, Regulus, perhaps even Orion – were supporting the patriarchal Black line, including Orion's sister and her Prewett children. They were aligned, allies, and despite what Walburga's side of the Black family did through Bellatrix or even Narcissa, Regulus and his side would not stand for it.</p><p>"What are <em>you</em> doing here?" a new voice cried out in shock, stepping out from behind the blond. He too was blond, with curly hair, and awfully familiar. Hermione froze as stared at the wizard, also in black. He was gripping his wand tightly, but nervously with the way he stared at Hermione and Regulus – his former year mates, and in Hermione's case, housemate.</p><p>"<em>Wilkes</em>?" she gapped.</p><p>"You know that wizard?" muttered Petunia under her breath, brushing up against her sister nervously.</p><p>Sputtering, Hermione managed to whisper back, "We were in the same house at Hogwarts. We shared a dorm."</p><p>"Evans," greeted Wilkes, nodding in her direction. The blond man – who looked somewhat like Wymond Wilkes, now that Hermione saw them standing side-by-side – clasped the ex-Ravenclaw's shoulder. Wilkes winced.</p><p>"Wy! You didn't tell me you knew Hermione Evans," the man grinned, although it was a nasty expression. His eyes locked on her. "You'll have to excuse my nephew and his poor manners. Rosier! Why don't you introduce us all to your old classmates?"</p><p>"<em>Rosier</em>?" muttered Regulus from just behind Hermione, his tone growing more irate as he spoke. "What is this, a Hogwarts reunion? Is Travers going to show up now? Albert Runcorn? Oliver Avery? <em>Clancy Brown</em>?"</p><p>Hermione resisted laughing as he finished at a near-growl – Regulus had finished his Hogwarts career without securing a date with Calypso Fawcett, who ended up dating Brown instead.</p><p>Evan Rosier was another classmate of theirs, along with Wilkes, but he had been a Slytherin and, according to Regulus, shy and unassuming. The fact that <em>two</em> of their year mates were along with Pyrites and Wilkes' uncle was enough for Hermione to cringe; this was an initiation for them. Evan sulked out from behind the two older men, tall, gangly, with a head full of curls all Blacks inherited. His hands were stuffed in his pockets and he slouched, reminding Hermione a bit of Barty when he got sulky.</p><p>"Evans," greeted Rosier with a mulish pout. "Regulus."</p><p>Both Regulus and Hermione gapped at the Ravenclaw and Slytherin, equally, even as Wilkes' uncle squeezed the wizard's shoulder, making Wilkes tense and gasp out, "What are you doing here?" he then eyed the two redheads. "And with <em>them</em>?"</p><p>Regulus and Hermione shared a glance.</p><p>"Helping my sister with her job," she finally said, settling on Petunia's lie. There was a tiny prickling of unease, but Hermione brushed it away. "We ran into the Prewetts here."</p><p>"<em>Here</em>? Not much to see, is there?" Pyrites looked around the dark forest, eyes wide in mock surprise. They narrowed on Hermione. "Of course, there is the… <em>alluring</em> scent of magic…"</p><p>Hermione hid a wince. That was one way to explain away the stink of Dark magic that permeated the forest from the Gaunt family's rituals and spellcasting over the decades.</p><p>"Yeah, well, you know," Regulus drawled blithely, sounding far too like Sirius for Hermione's comfort, "You get a few duds when it comes to vacations. Nothing here at all to see: ten out of ten would <em>not</em> recommend."</p><p>The weight of the stares of those in the forest was heavy on Regulus. Behind them all, Sean clapped a free hand to his face and moaned, "Oh, Jesus, that was <em>so</em> bad…"</p><p>Regulus flushed, pulling a bit on his jacket as he straightened it nervously. He muttered, "Yes, well… I panicked."</p><p>Pursing her lips, Hermione turned back to Rosier and Wilkes, eyeing her former year mates. She began shuffling Petunia closer to Sean, and down the dirt path, they had taken from the path that led to the Riddle house and cemetery. The prickling was worse, like eyes on her back. It made the small hairs at the nape of her neck tickle.</p><p>"Listen – we were just out for a stroll. We don't have any conflict with you, so… we'll be on our way."</p><p>Wilkes closed his eyes, relief shining on his face, but his uncle squeezed his shoulder again and stepped forward. "But we have so much to talk about, Evans! Like – how you left Malfoy Manor so quickly."</p><p>"Not much to talk about there," replied Hermione carefully, her eyes moving between the two older wizards. Rosier and Wilkes didn't seem interested in participating – which made Hermione wonder just <em>what</em> Wilkes had seen or done since he last tried to talk to Barty about joining – which meant that Snyde and Pyrites were the two to watch.</p><p>"I beg to differ, <em>lisonok</em>."</p><p>Hermione inhaled sharply, her entire body freezing as the masculine voice drifted toward the group from behind. She <em>knew</em> that voice; she <em>knew</em> that wizard, very, very well, and had hoped it would be years before she ran into that specific Death Eater again.</p><p>Slowly, she turned even as the prickling she felt from earlier hit her full force, as dark eyes framed by tousled hair and a long face slipped between the thin trees. The wizard's shadow was as smoky and ephemeral as a ghost until he emerged facing Sean, just paces away.</p><p>"<em>You,"</em> breathed Hermione, her voice lost in the ambient noises of the forest and the rustle of leaves from a breeze.</p><p>Nearby, Regulus glanced at Hermione in worry from between Petunia and Gideon. There were very few people who could reduce Hermione to who she was from before, and his cousin was not in front of them.</p><p>The man was tall and lean, older than Hermione, with longish dark hair and pale eyes against a lean face. He wore wizard's robes that were different to what the British wore; they had more of a military cut to them in the sharp angles on the robes that were cut off at the waist, with tails; his trousers tucked into well-worn boots. His eyes fixated on Hermione.</p><p>"I am afraid we have not had the pleasure," he began, his voice accented. His mouth tipped into a smile – if one could call it that. "Although I am aware of you, Miss Evans. I am Antonin Dolohov."</p><p>He finished his introduction with a tiny, sharp bow.</p><p>"Potter," snarled Hermione, instinctively. "It's Potter."</p><p>He inclined his head as he straightened. "Yes, I heard you were recently married. My congratulations."</p><p>Hermione barred her teeth in a silent snarl, and the man continued to speak, even as Regulus inched toward Hermione.</p><p>"When my Lord spoke of your magic and talents, I was intrigued. I had so wanted to be there that evening to see your abilities." His eyes glittered. "Perhaps you would do me the honour of showing me now?"</p><p>"Hermione," warned Regulus, under his breath.</p><p>"Gladly," she snapped, ignoring her friend. Her wand jutted out and nonverbally, she cast; the ground beneath Dolohov's feet turned from dirt to sand, immediately sinking him to his knees.</p><p>That seemed to be the signal for the free-for-all: Snyde and Pyrites immediately launched forward with their own spells, both at Fabian and Gideon. Regulus was forced backward, away from Hermione to defend Fabian, while Gideon – and Sean, nearby – were immediately on the defensive.</p><p>Wilkes and Rosier lingered behind the older Death Eaters, carefully prowling around for openings in which they slunk their own spells through, only for Regulus to throw himself forward in a desperate bid to block, or Sean used the shovel to catch the spell.</p><p>But Dolohov was clever; he apparated out of the quicksand to solid ground several feet away, causing Hermione to keep on her heel to face him. She launched <em>incarcerous</em> at him, ropes flinging themselves from her wand to bind the wizard, but he burnt them, using the smoke from the ropes as cover to apparate closer to her until he was an arms' length away. His eyes, pale, were cold and focused on her.</p><p>Hermione gasped, up close to one of her two personal demons from her last life. But she wasn't a sixteen-year-old girl, untrained, anymore. Despite that, instinct overtook, and she slapped the wizard.</p><p>He blinked in shock, and Hermione took a cue from his playbook, and apparate several feet away.</p><p>Dolohov's eyes snapped to her new location. A glint of amusement appeared, and he apparated – landing just shy of her new position, and with a spell already flying toward her.</p><p>Hermione spun and disapparated. She appeared behind him, shouting, "<em>Expulso</em>!"</p><p>He sensed her and knelt, the spell flying above him and disappearing down the path into the darkness that led back to the Gaunt shack. Glancing at her over his shoulder, he snarled and cried, "<em>Avada Kedavra!</em>"</p><p>Hermione twisted the earth below her feet into the same smooth wall of earth she once used to block Snape's attack on James when they were teenagers at Hogwarts; the killing curse impacted the wall and sent bits of dirt and clumps everywhere. A cloud of dirt blocked her vision.</p><p>A wind charm sent the dirt away, but the space where Dolohov was, was empty. She blinked.</p><p>"Behind you, <em>lisonok</em>," a cold voice breathed against her ear.</p><p>Hermione's heart slammed hard against her chest and she disapparated, blindly, appearing several meters down the path and away from the others.</p><p>Dolohov caught her wide, panicked eyes and grinned. He disapparated.</p><p>Spinning, Hermione's eyes darted everywhere for the Death Eater. When he didn't immediately appear, Hermione knelt and placed both hands flat on the ground, sending her magic through the earth in search of any ley lines or magic to connect to. She could feel the inky darkness of the Gaunt shack behind her, and there was no way she would tap into that magic to help – it felt like tar was clogging her throat and she wasn't even calling it to her. There was a faint trace of magic closer to the Riddle grounds, but it felt jagged, and it took Hermione a moment to realize it was Voldemort's, fractured and raw from when he killed his father and grandparents and made a Horcrux.</p><p>Instead, Hermione closed her eyes and let her magic sweep over the others: Fabian and Gideon were two, warm bright embers in the dark, equal in power and strength that flared and waned like a candle flickering as they fought. Regulus as a steady presence of thick water, cool and steady as he kept his wits about him and continued to cast with precision and focus. Petunia barely registered, but was a tiny bubble, while Sean was a dull, empty space in her senses.</p><p>Snyde and Pyrites were dark blights, nowhere near as dark as others she had encountered, but felt disgusting, like one smelling rotten egg when not expecting it. Wilkes and Rosier were tainted, but nowhere near the older wizards' magic: they instead felt like a clear evening sky, dark but with enough light from the moon and stars.</p><p>But where was Dolohov?</p><p>Her magic spread out a bit further, licking at the base of the nearby trees, and—</p><p><em>Above!</em> Hermione's eyes popped open and her head jerked up. Dolohov caught her eyes from where he was attached to one of the thicker, older trees, using sticking charms to keep himself against the trunk.</p><p>His wand was pointed at her, and with a grim look, he cast something familiar: a rough purple spell, moving quickly, raced down at her.</p><p>Hermione froze for the tiniest of moments and then threw herself forward, rolling out of the way as the spell hit the earth behind her in a small crater, sending dirt everywhere.</p><p>A pop made her dodge left, even as Dolohov followed her, sending spell after spell. Hermione alternated between casting <em>protego</em>, summoning physical branches to block his spells, or outright dodging, until she was once again in the fray of the others, close to where Petunia stood behind Regulus, clutching her tote bag.</p><p>Rosier seemed unsure of what to do, unsure of working alongside others – not the way that Hermione could battle with Regulus and Barty at her back without worry – and struggled to find openings to cast at Regulus… or it was he just didn't want to hit his old Slytherin dormmate.</p><p>But he did cast a spell, one Hermione recognized as a schoolyard level <em>tarantallegra</em>. Regulus instinctively avoided it, but Petunia didn't know what it was and didn't have the experience of dodging flashes of light and spellfire the way the others did. Petunia let out a shriek, twisting out of the way of his spell with wide eyes.</p><p>Her response to the fighting was the throw her tote bag toward Rosier. He wasn't expecting it – his eye went wide at the sight of the neon green, fringed bag flying at him – and it smacked him, hard, in the face, given it was filled with their notes, the Horcrux, and Petunia's odds and ends. He let out a loud exhale and hit the floor, falling backward into a prickly bush.</p><p>"Pet!" Sean swung around, the shovel flying with him as he did so.</p><p>At Sean's side, Gideon went under the wide swing of the shovel, tripping backward and away from Pyrites as the wizard sneered at him, wand up and snapping out of the first syllables to his spell.</p><p>However, Sean continued with the swing, something wild and wide in his eyes, and Pyrites didn't have time to dodge or cast <em>protego</em>. The metal end of the shovel connected with his head and Pyrites collapsed, like a puppet whose string had been cut. Blood pooled under him and Hermione could only see it from the faint flashes of spellfire, causing the liquid to glisten.</p><p>"Holy shit!" gasped Regulus, breathlessly. Gideon froze for a second, staring down at Pyrites, and then transferring his stare at Sean – although the Muggle didn't seem to notice or care.</p><p>Hermione ducked under a spell, absently, and scrambled toward Petunia. She was squatting, arms over her head with her eyes closed. Hermione fell to her knees, next to her sister, and touched her shoulder.</p><p>Petunia shrieked again, and this time Hermione dodged her pen. "Whoa! Tuney, it's <em>me</em>!"</p><p>Petunia's eyes peeled open. "Hermione?"</p><p>"Yes, hello," replied Hermione, sighing in relief. "Are you okay?"</p><p>Sean fell to his knees then, on Petunia's other side, and dropped his bloodied shovel. "Pet!"</p><p>"Sean!" sobbed Petunia, falling into his arms.</p><p>He and Hermione shared a look over Petunia's head, and Hermione quickly swivelled and stood in one motion. Hermione placed her bare palm on the trunk of the tree nearest to her. Runes and symbols in green raced up and down the bark from where her palm was placed, and behind the markings, the tree began to wiggle as though alive.</p><p>Then, its branches swung down, and its roots pulled up and out of the earth. The tree came alive, groaning under the strain of moving. Wilkes cried out, stumbling back over his feet and into his uncle.</p><p>Snyde sneered, his wand arm moving in harsh slashing cuts; the red of a <em>reducto</em> emerged, one spell after another as he battered against the tree. Each hit sent the tree reeling back, but only a little, as it recovered and continued.</p><p>Fabian took advantage of Snyde's preoccupation, his own spells causing the wizard to curse and split his attention between the tree and Fabian.</p><p>"Wymond! Do something, boy!" shouted Snyde.</p><p>Wilkes stuttered through a spell, barely effective as his <em>bombarda</em> only managed to send one limb fly from the tree.</p><p>The tree paused, briefly, and then one of its branches launched forward, sharp, and thin, toward Wilkes. Like the Whomping Willow, it wrapped around the young wizard's ankle and lifted him off the ground, flinging him through the air, crying.</p><p>"Oh, for Merlin's sake!" Snyde turned on his heel and used the cutting curse to hit the branch that had his nephew, and Wilkes fell to the earth, hard, groaning. He then summoned the young man, turning on his heel again to face Fabian, whose aim was true.</p><p>His cutting curse cut through the space between him and Snyde; but Snyde had summoned Wilkes, and let the spell continue to use him as a human shield. The cutting curse hit Wilkes in the chest, racing up to his neck.</p><p>The Ravenclaw classmate of Hermione's made a soft sound – something she heard over the general noise of their fight – as his eyes went wide and his face, pale. He then fell to his knees, and then back.</p><p><em>"WILKES!"</em> someone shouted. It took Hermione a moment to realize it was her, just as Rosier shouted, "Wy!"</p><p>"Until the next, <em>lisonok</em>."</p><p>Hermione's eyes pulled from Wilkes' body to Dolohov. He lowered his wand, casting a cold look around their battle: Sean and Petunia, partially hidden by Gideon; Fabian, his chest heaving even as his eyes focused on Wilkes' body; Regulus, who was casting to keep Snyde from moving toward them; and Rosier, who had dropped to Wilkes' side.</p><p>Dolohov's pale eyes lingered on Hermione for a moment; she shivered. His lips turned upward in the tiniest of quirks, and he reached out to grab Rosier, kneeling by Wilkes.</p><p>"What—" Rosier's sentence was cut off as Dolohov apparated them both, the pop loud. Snyde swore and followed, not even pausing to look at his nephew, gasping on the ground.</p><p>Those who remained barely breathed, frozen until Hermione darted forward and she was at Wilkes' side. His eyes focused on her, wide and terrified, as blood bubbled out from Fabian's curse. His neck was the worst, sending the blood gushing out, quickly.</p><p>Regulus swore as he appeared next to her, conjuring cloths. Hermione plucked them from the air, pressing hard against the neck wound. "C'mon Wilkes. Stay with me."</p><p>She looked up at Regulus. "Can we get him to St. Mungo's?"</p><p>"Why would you—" burst out Gideon, his voice thick with anger, but he broke off when Fabian placed a hand on his brother's shoulder.</p><p>Regulus, who had been staring at Wilkes, moved his eyes at Hermione and said nothing.</p><p>"Reg?" Hermione's voice strained and cracked as she stared at him. When he slowly turned away, Hermione inhaled sharply and turned back to Wilkes, who was staring at her.</p><p>He tried to raise a trembling hand, and Hermione caught it, clutching it tightly. "It's going to be okay, Wilkes."</p><p>Wilkes' mouth opened and he wheezed something she couldn't make out. His mouth closed and he tried again, his voice thin and whistling. Blood dribbled down his chin. "Whh—whh—<em>Wymond</em>."</p><p>Hermione sniffed. "Okay. Okay. It's going to be okay, Wymond. I'm… I'm right here."</p><p>His blue eyes were cloudy with pain, and his body shuddered. He strained, gasping, "<em>He'mione</em>."</p><p>"Wymond?"</p><p>But his eyes clouded over, and then the blue dulled. His body relaxed, and the grip Wilkes had on Hermione's hand eased, slipping from hers until it hit the ground, a soft thud.</p><p>Hermione sniffed again, and asked, thickly, "Wymond?"</p><p>Regulus reached out and carefully closed Wilkes' eyes.</p><hr /><p>Somehow, by unspoken agreement, the six found themselves at the local pub in Little Hangleton, not wishing to expend the energy to either Apparate out to London or summon the Knight Bus to take them – plus Petunia and Sean – elsewhere.</p><p>The pub itself, the Hanged Man, was dingy and dirty and empty except for the usual crowd of men who stared blearily into their pints and kept to themselves in the darkened corners of the low-ceiling pub. The six wearily sat at a table near the front window, Hermione and Regulus allowing Gideon to take the most secure position with his back against the wall, while they took the others by a column facing the bar. Fabian, Petunia, and Sean were left with the window at their back.</p><p>Sean ordered them all pints, despite the early time, and collected them with Petunia's help, distributing the glasses to everyone. No one spoke: Fabian stared at his drink, and Regulus's head kept slipping down toward his chest as he nodded off, only to jerk back up every so often. Hermione stared at the blood on her hands, in her lap, and out of sight from the barkeep.</p><p>There was a weary, exhausted feeling in the air for the group after what they had just experienced, but it was Fabian who cleared his throat first, and tentatively said, "So… we don't tell anyone about this, right?"</p><p>Hermione turned curious eyes on the short-haired redhead. "Don't you need to tell Dumbledore?"</p><p>Gideon scowled at her. "How do you know about that?"</p><p>"That you're part of his Order?" Regulus yawned. "Kind of obvious, cousin."</p><p>"And what were <em>you</em> doing out in the forest?" prodded Petunia, leaning forward over the table toward the two twins. "You never said."</p><p>Fabian answered first, ignoring his brother's hiss. "We've been combing quadrants for Dumbledore – checking areas for dark magic. We mark them up and then send a team to do recon in the area if there is anything lingering. It was our first time in Little Hangleton and what happens but us coming across you lot."</p><p>"So, it was all by luck?" asked Sean, blinking. "You weren't sent out to find Hermione and Regulus?"</p><p>Fabian and Gideon shared a glance, with Gideon turning back to them, brows furrowed. "Um, no…?"</p><p>Hermione exhaled in relief.</p><p>"And really," continued Fabian, eyes darting between the four of them, "We really didn't come across anyone but dark wizards, did we? I mean—" he broke off and shared another look with Gideon, this one a bit grim "–we'll probably have to tell Dumbledore we had a fight and Wilkes is—"</p><p>This time, Regulus inhaled sharply. Hermione's hand clenched in her lap and she stared down hard at them, the dried blood on them drawing her gaze. Petunia reached for her sister and placed a clean hand over Hermione's. Hermione looked up at her, and Petunia's eyes were soft when she squeezed her hand.</p><p>"Yeah," mumbled Regulus, turning to look out the thick, warped glass of the pub's window, blinking rapidly. He and Wilkes had not been friends – nor dorm mates the way Hermione and Barty had been with the wizard, but… - he gave a tiny, delicate sniff.</p><p>The group fell to silence again, but then Sean picked up his pint, held it out, and Hermione and Regulus, upon realizing what he was doing, copied him. Petunia was next, and then Fabian. Gideon followed last, a sour look on his face as he did so, but said nothing as the group held their glasses aloft for a silent toast.</p><p>They each took a sip.</p><p>Then, Fabian turned to them, and asked, voice rift with curiosity, "Yes, but what <em>were</em> you doing out there?"</p><p>Hermione put her glass down and leaned across the table, closer to him. "Can you keep a secret, Fabian?"</p><p>The redhead mimicked her, leaning across the table, and nodded earnestly.</p><p>"Good." Hermione's lips spread into a tiny smile. "So can I."</p><p>He scowled and Gideon snorted into his glass. The other twin chuckled and asked, "Why the bloody hell aren't you in Dumbledore's Order?" his eyes slid to Hermione and then Regulus. "Especially given your husband and your brother are involved."</p><p>Hermione leaned back and shrugged. "Honestly? I don't really trust Dumbledore."</p><p>"You don't trust the greatest wizard, ever?" asked Fabian, stupefied.</p><p>"I trust that he's trying to stop the war," said Hermione carefully, "But I don't think he's going about it the best way. I think he's limited by his position and those in power in the Ministry, but I think he has you running out to <em>react</em> instead of <em>act</em>. I also think he keeps things from his members, only telling them what he thinks they should know instead of everything they <em>should</em> know when going into a situation."</p><p>Gideon was looking at her, hard but curious-like, and slowly nodded.</p><p>"I can see that," he finally said, slowly. "And that was what made you go off on your own?"</p><p>"Who said we're doing things on our own?" bit out Regulus immediately, eyes fixated on his cousin.</p><p>Gideon's eyebrows rose. "Well, aren't you?"</p><p>"I can neither confirm nor deny such action," rejoined Hermione, carefully keeping her eyes on Gideon.</p><p>He slowly nodded.</p><p>Petunia cleared her throat. "So, Fabian, Gideon. What do you do as a career when you're not out trying to save the magical world? That one wizard said something about a parchment-pusher…?"</p><p>Fabian groaned and Gideon snickered. "Fabe's a curse breaker."</p><p>Hermione's mouth dropped open.</p><p>"But he spends most of his time doing research for Gringott's instead of out on site," continued Gideon, "Hence the 'parchment pusher' epithet." He paused and then looked around the table. "As for myself, you might have noticed my suspicious behaviour toward you. It is because <em>I</em> am a junior investigator at the Daily Prophet."</p><p>"You're a journalist?" squeaked Petunia, eyes wide. "So am I! I was the one who found the information that led us here—"</p><p>And like that, Gideon and Petunia were off, shooting questions and replies and forth, with Sean eagerly invested in the conversation as he asked for clarification from the magical side of things.</p><p>"—figure out this Dark Lord that's bothering everyone, anyway, his father was a Riddle and his mother must have come from here," Petunia was saying.</p><p>Gideon, who was in the process of taking a drink, choked and the ale came out of his nose even as he held a hand up to block it. He stared at Petunia. "<em>What</em>? You-Know-Who's father was a <em>muggle</em>?"</p><p>Petunia hesitantly nodded, looking unsure if she should be disgusted at the brown liquid dripping from Gideon's nose or not.</p><p>"And <em>you</em> found this out?" continued Gideon, eyes wide. "By just doing research on the muggle side of things?"</p><p>Amused, Hermione commented, "It's amazing what a partnership can do when you share things."</p><p>Gideon and Fabian made noises of agreement, but Hermione's eyes had slid away as he caught Petunia's stare. She wilted the tiniest bit, seeing Petunia's thin eyebrows shoot toward her hairline with the most unimpressed look Petunia could ever create.</p><p><em>Hypocrite</em>, the look seemed to say.</p><p>Hermione sighed. <em>I know</em>, she wanted to reply to Petunia, but Sean was off telling Gideon and Fabian what he knew of the situation regarding Voldemort, the Riddles, with Regulus carefully following along to stop him if he needed to.</p><p>Hermione knew she would have to tell James soon – but the question was, when would be the best time to tell her husband that she had lived a previous life in the future and knew things that no one should have ever known? All that she, Barty, and Regulus were doing?</p><p>When would she stop being the brainy Hermione Evans, Ravenclaw, and dig deep and bring out that Gryffindor courage that Hermione Granger was known to be instead?</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>Halloween, 1979</strong>
</p><p>James was snoring heavily beside Hermione, one arm thrown over her midsection. Her bladder was making itself known, but Hermione was still bleary and headachy from the excessive alcohol she had consumed at the Halloween party she and James had thrown the day before and had no desire to move from the bed, find something to put on to cover her naked self, or to leave the warmth of the bed.</p><p>Even if her bladder kept insistently pulsing. She'd wait until James moved first – or a miracle happened.</p><p>A silver streak flew toward them, coming through the wall. Hermione shrieked, throwing James's arm off her; the lights on the wall, all gas, lit themselves as Hermione began moving, leaving their bedroom in a soft, orange-tinted glow from behind heavy, thick glass.</p><p>James, himself, woke with a snort due to Hermione's heavy handling. Unsure of what was going on, he threw himself off the bed, summoning his wand directly into his hand. He was in a crouch, blinking as he tried to focus on the glowing bird hovering in the air at the foot of their bed.</p><p>"What the f—"</p><p>"James. A large magical disturbance is occurring at the Rolling Stones," said Dumbledore, his voice coming from the phoenix Patronus. "All Order members are being called in. Come at once. Be prepared."</p><p>Hermione blinked as the bird dissipated in a burst of silver stars, glitter falling to the bed and floor but not leaving behind any remnants. She turned slowly to James, who seemed more awake now, despite the heavy scowl he wore. His hair was messier than normal, stuck up in all directions.</p><p>"Have you seen my specs?" he asked, a sour note in his voice as he stood, completely unashamed of his state of undress. "I can't see them…"</p><p>Hermione wordlessly summoned them and then banished them at him. James saw the glint of light and caught it like he would catch his snitch. Once the glasses were on, Hermione saw that his eyes were bleary and bloodshot. They were both still hungover.</p><p>James roughly scrubbed at his face. "Fuck. Voldemort attacking now? Couldn't he have waited for the weekend?"</p><p>Hermione snorted, curling up and bringing the bedsheet over her head. "It's Halloween. He's making a scene because he's a drama queen."</p><p>James snickered, although it was a sleepy sound. There was a noise as he yanked on clothes, trying to wake up. "Real inconsiderate of him but sounds right. Can I call him that to his face?"</p><p>"Mmhmm… but be prepared to not come home if that's the case," hummed Hermione, nestling further into the cozy warmth of the bed. "Or call him 'Tom.' He'll hate that."</p><p>James paused, but Hermione could not see the startled expression on his face, being no more than a lump in the middle of their bed. Instead, he smoothed down his shirt and reached for a leather jacket, eschewing his robes for maneuverability.</p><p>Fondly, he reached for the lump, poking at it until he found her foot and yanked her down the bed some. Hermione sputtered, throwing the covers off her head to glare at him, her curls going in all directions and looking far worse than his bedhead did at the moment.</p><p>James grinned. He leaned down and gave her a light kiss on the temple, and then another peck on her lips. "Don't wait up. I'll be fine."</p><p>He let his hand linger as he drew back; Hermione reached for him and yanked him down for a very wet and messy kiss. "Don't die," she muttered, eyes half-closed and crusted with sleep. "I'll be wroth if you do."</p><p>"I'll do my best," snickered James, and then left their room. She barely heard the pop of his disapparation from the receiving room; instead, she brought the covers up and rolled onto her back. Blinking, she stared at the ceiling and drummed her fingers on top of the bedsheets.</p><p>She was awake, now.</p><p>With a huff, she threw the covers back and dressed, muttering under her breath as she went to the kitchen to start the kettle. Tea would help. Tea would get her mind off the idea of James going to fight with Dumbledore's order. Where did the Patronus say they were again? She frowned, the name coming to her. The Rolling Stones. Had there been a skirmish in her time there? She could barely remember.</p><p>Hermione waited for the water to boil in the kettle, absently seating herself at the table in the kitchen. She went through the routine of pouring the boiled water into a teapot, adding the loose leaves into a bag and then putting the bag into the pot, and then letting the tea steep before pouring.</p><p>She didn't drink, though; she cupped her hands around the warm mug and stared out of the kitchen sink window, into the darkness. When she next blinked or became aware, the soft light of dawn was creeping across the floorboards and her tea was cold.</p><p>With a frown, Hermione cast a warming charm on her tea, and the teapot, and glanced at the kitchen clock. James had been gone for four hours.</p><p>Without realizing it, she continued the pattern, cupping her hands around the mug and staring out the window with absent glances at the clock, watching the minutes and hours tick on, and on, and on…</p><p>It was nearly eleven when she felt the wards around the townhouse shift. She rose to her feet, turning to face the hallway. James staggered through into the kitchen, blinking at her in her pajamas and the mug on the table.</p><p>He was dirty, covered in sweat and grime. His robes – the dragonhide ones she got for him not so long ago – were singed in a few places and had deep gouge marks, but he wasn't holding himself gingerly or could have been too badly hurt. There was the starting of a bruise by his chin, swelling his bottom lip – but otherwise, he was alive, and home, and that was all Hermione cared about.</p><p>Hermione threw herself at him, her arms around his neck before she realized what she had done.</p><p>James laughed but staggered back on his heels. His voice was hoarse when he chided, "Oof! Well, I missed you, too, love…"</p><p>Hermione pulled back enough to kiss him soundly. "You're safe. You're fine."</p><p>"I am," he replied, face soft. "So are the others, your sister, too."</p><p>Hermione sighed in relief, eyes sliding over his bruised chin. "I have some dittany and bruise paste for that if you'd like."</p><p>"Yeah, I'd appreciate that." James closed his eyes. "Moody wants me to still come to my evening shift."</p><p>"Bastard," muttered Hermione, turning. She grabbed James's hand and pulled him to her chair, pushing him into it. He gratefully sank into the chair with a soft moan of delight, even as Hermione bustled around the cabinets for the pastes.</p><p>As she did so, James peeled out of his dragonhide jacket, gingerly. He hissed as it pulled at a few open cuts on his arms – the longest on his left arm, along his wand holster, like someone had tried to slice it from him.</p><p>"That doesn't look so good," muttered Hermione with a frown.</p><p>James grinned. "You should see the other guy."</p><p>She raised her eyebrows in response but sank to her knees next to him with the bruise paste on the floor. Using a clean towel, she dipped a corner of the towel into it and then began to gently dab and apply the paste onto James's chin.</p><p>He sighed as the paste began to absorb into his skin and the swelling went down a bit. He slid down the seat a bit, completely relaxed, and a glance at his face showed that James had his eyes closed and his mouth was the tiniest bit slack. Hermione smiled and went back to work, examining his chin and his swollen lower lip.</p><p>Once the area was coated with a shiny residue, Hermione turned to his arm, turning it over gently to better access the cut.</p><p>"<em>Tergeo</em>," she murmured, directing her wand along his arm and siphoning the blood and dirt off of him, directing the blob to the sink. Once the area was clean. she used the other end of the towel to avoid double-dipping and began to gently dab at the largest parts of the cut.</p><p>James hissed as Hermione dabbed the dittany on his open wounds along his arm but didn't pull away. He seemed boneless, slumped in his seat with his hazel eyes unfocused but staring unerringly at her hands as she worked.</p><p>"We could have used you."</p><p>Hermione froze but did not startle at the sound of his voice. She did not look up at James – she didn't want to see the accusation in his eyes – and instead stilled her hands, resting on his warm arm, staring at the bits of red on the towel.</p><p>Finally, she said, quietly, "It wasn't my fight."</p><p>James huffed, indignant. "Wasn't your fight—"</p><p>"You <em>know</em> why I couldn't be there," she interrupted quietly, changing a glance up at him. He looked tired, blackish marks appearing under his eyes from a lack of poor sleep and the remnants of his hangover. His mouth was pulled down in a frown, and there were the faintest lines around it.</p><p><em>He's only twenty</em>, thought Hermione, hysterically. Far too young for stress lines; far too young to be dead in two years.</p><p>"But you're… your abilities, your strength," muttered James, a bit desperate as his eyes darted around her face, frantic. "The report from Malfoy Manor – the spells you cast – how you <em>survived</em>—"</p><p>"I know," soothed Hermione, brow furrowed. She bit her lip and settled back on her heels, a bit away from James, but still close. She peered up at him. "But you're playing the 'what if' game, James. What if I had been there? What if I used my transmutation skills? What if Voldemort focused on me?"</p><p>James shuddered at the thought. It was bad enough that he and Lily had teamed up to fight Voldemort directly, sloppy with their combined hangovers since Lily had been at their townhouse hours earlier for their party. They had barely managed to hold him off, but not before he had completed a ritual and killed a dozen Muggles.</p><p>If Hermione had been then… would Voldemort have been playing with them? Or would he have gone straight for her, knowing what she was capable of? Knowing what damage, she and Regulus and Crouch had caused the last time they went up against him?</p><p>"I'm doing my part," continued Hermione, softly. "Just like you are. I'm still fighting him, James. It's just looking a bit different than what you do."</p><p>James leaned back in his chair, tilting his head back as he exhaled. Peering at her through slitted eyes even as his glasses slid down his nose, James murmured, "When are you gonna tell me what you're doing?"</p><p>Hermione's shoulders slumped. "It's hard to explain." She paused. "It's hard to believe."</p><p>James placed his free hand over hers, still pressing the towel into his cuts, already healing under her dittany. "I'll believe you. You must know that – I'll believe whatever you tell me."</p><p>She huffed out her own laugh, under her breath. "I'm no Gryffindor, James. I'm working up my courage to tell you."</p><p>James' head came down. His eyes were wide. "But soon?"</p><p>"Soon," she nodded.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>December 1979</strong>
</p><p>Hermione wobbled the tiniest amount as she and James Apparated into Cokeworth by the abandoned quarry a few minutes from her parents' house. Immediately, James was at her side, hovering, concerned. "Are you alright?"</p><p>"I'm fine," replied Hermione, closing her eyes, and inhaling as she tried to banish nausea. She peeked one eye open and saw James's frown. "Well, I will be."</p><p>"We can make our excuses…"</p><p>"No!" cried Hermione, turning to James. "I promised Tuney we'd be there! Moral support!"</p><p>James rolled his eyes, muttering, "Moral support, my arse…"</p><p>They waited a few moments longer and then began walking into the small, dingy town, with Hermione telling James a bit more of her childhood and what it was like growing up the youngest of three girls – and precocious at that.</p><p>As they passed a tiny park, she said, "And this is where Snape broke a branch on that willow tree and it nearly beaned Tuney in the head. She screamed and was <em>not</em> happy with Lily for remaining friends with him after that. It was definitely worse after the letter Dumbledore wrote…"</p><p>"Dumbledore wrote a letter?" asked James curiously, swinging their joined hands between them as they turned away from the park and to the side streets that led to the Evans rowhouse.</p><p>Hermione nodded. "Petunia was… jealous that we had magic and she didn't. She wrote to the Headmaster, begging to attend. He did write a… nice letter back in response, but Lily and Snape found it when they were snooping in her room. He made fun of her, and that… that was just about it between Lily and Petunia. They still haven't really recovered."</p><p>"Blimey," sighed James. "Makes me glad I'm an only child – but let's be honest: Sirius is my brother but other than…" he trailed off and glanced at Hermione, clearing his throat. "We've never been that bad."</p><p>Hermione hummed her agreement, turning onto her old childhood street. She waved to one neighbour she knew but didn't stop until they were outside her parents' house, the last one on the street before the empty field at the edge of town. There was the barest hint of snow dusting the ground, but she knew that would be gone by the next day, replaced by rain.</p><p>"Should we knock?" asked James.</p><p>Hermione shook her head and opened the door, shouting, "Mum! Dad! It's us!"</p><p>Petunia reached them first, barrelling toward them down the narrow hallway from the kitchen at the back of the rowhouse. She flung her arms around Hermione so hard that she stumbled back a step.</p><p>When Petunia released her, she was beaming, and her eyes were wet. Hermione rolled her eyes. "You're not going to be able to keep this secret until dinner if you continue to act like this."<br />
"Aren't you <em>excited</em>?" gushed Petunia, reaching out to squeeze Hermione again. Her eyes darted off to the side. "Oh, hello, James."</p><p>Amused at being forgotten, James hid a smile, even as he hung his coat up on the rack by the door. He reached for Hermione's as he replied, "Hullo, Petunia. Where's Sean?"</p><p>"Living room."</p><p>James nodded, pressing a kiss to Hermione's cheek as he took her coat, hung it up, and then disappeared through the partially closed door to their left, entering the living room to warm greetings from Sean and his father-in-law. It sounded like there were a few more people in there, too, prompting Hermione to turn to Petunia with a quirked eyebrow.</p><p>"Uncle Duncan and gran and grandad," she answered, taking Hermione by the arm, and pulling her down the hall to the kitchen. "C'mon, we're almost done and with you here to help – well, it'll go faster, and then we can eat faster, and then we can share our news."</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes but allowed herself to be tugged along. In the kitchen, her mother was darting between checking a sauce on the cooktop and the roast in the over, despite a timer counting down for her.</p><p>"Hi mum," said Hermione.</p><p>"Oh, Hermione, love," greeted Rose as she turned, hugging her daughter. "It's so lovely to see you. Now we're just waiting on Lily – I hope she'll be here, soon."</p><p>"I'm sure she will," soothed Hermione. "Apparation makes it easy to be fashionably late when you instantly pop from place to place."</p><p>"It sure is convenient," sighed Rose, turning back to the food.</p><p>"Can I help?" asked Hermione, bringing her wand out.</p><p>Curious, Rose nodded, and Hermione gave a few jabs and swishes toward the pots and stirring rod, and then toward the countertops covered with dirty mixing bowls, cutting boards, and cutlery. Immediately, the bowls moved to the sink where the tap turned on by itself and the water was immediately boiling hot – dish soap was added – the scrubber submerged and began scrubbing the dirty dishes, that once clean, floated toward a hovering dishtowel. The towel wiped the bowl down and then floated it to the correct cupboard, all to Rose's amazement.</p><p>Petunia looked smug from where she stood by the doorway. "See? Didn't I tell you, mum?"</p><p>"Well, we are certainly going to be ready for lunch earlier than I expected." Rose turned from gapping at the magic in her kitchen to fretting as she turned toward her daughters. "I do hope Lily will be on time, now."</p><p>With final checks and preparation to be made – with Hermione placing warming charms on dishes so they remained warm and fresh as they were set on the table – the entire family migrated to the dining area off the kitchen, loudly appearing in clumps and groups as people carried on conversations. Lily snuck in as people were seating themselves, a bit pale in the face with her straight red hair down and hanging a bit lanky. Despite being dressed nicely in a fashionable frock, Petunia and Hermione shared a concerned look.</p><p>Bowls and plates were passed around as the meal began, Leonard and their grandfather Humphrey at the two heads, carrying on a conversation across the entire length of the table with Sean and Duncan debating the validity of a recent horse race (with James watching in amusement); Rose and their grandmother Marie were casting concerned looks at Lily, but saying nothing as Marie asked Petunia about her career and if she had written anything that was published anywhere.</p><p>Petunia and Hermione sat side-by-side, with their husbands next to them, taking up one entire side of the table; across from them, in bracketed by their grandmother and mother, sat their uncle Duncan and Lily, whose face grew paler and paler as the conversation and meal continued.</p><p>Eventually during a lull in conversation about halfway through the meal, while everyone was moving toward full stomachs and picking at the food on their plates, Rose turned toward her eldest and youngest daughters, and asked, "So, Pet, what was the big news you wanted to share with everyone?"</p><p>Under the table, Petunia's hand reached out and clutched at Hermione's, tightly squeezing even as she turned to Sean and they shared a smile. She turned back to Rose. "Well, mum, dad, it's actually something Hermione and I want to share—"</p><p>Across the table, Lily swallowed a burp, her chest heaving as she went bone white.</p><p>Petunia paused.</p><p>Everyone's attention shifted to Lily as she heaved again. Her eyes went wide, and she frantically scanned the table, reaching for the nearly empty serving bowl of collard greens. She yanked the bowl toward her. Her face went green, and she vomited into the bowl.</p><p>Beside her, their uncle Duncan began laughing, even as he fished out a handkerchief and passed it to his niece. Rose turned to Lily, crying, "Lily! Lily, darling, are you not well?" while Leonard blinked in shock, and then heavily buried his face in his hands, resting his elbows on the table.</p><p>Using Duncan's handkerchief to wipe away some vomit lingering around her mouth, Lily, pale-faced but no longer green, and sweating just the tiniest bit, looked up at everyone staring at her and morosely announced, "I'm pregnant."</p><p>There was a moment of silence. Then:</p><p>"What do you <em>mean</em>, pregnant, Lily, you're not <em>married</em>?"</p><p>"Pregnant! Lily!"</p><p>"Are you bloody <em>kidding</em> me?"</p><p>"How long have you known, Lily?"</p><p>Hermione sat, her hand still tightly gripping Petunia's, although at this point it was more to keep her sister in her seat from lunging across the table and stabbing Lily with the fork that was in her other hand. Sean must have seen the murderous look and the fork because he quickly did a doubletake and then pried it from Petunia's grip, setting it down on his far side.</p><p>Beside her, James had his mouth open in shock, but under his breath, he muttered, "Mischief managed."</p><p>Hermione immediately turned to him with a glare. Sheepishly, he turned his gaze back to his plate, although he was hiding a smile.</p><p>Across from them, Lily was silently crying, sniffling as Rose wrapped an arm around her. "I just <em>happened</em>, mum, I didn't plan for it! Honest!" she gave their grandparents a bit of a stink-eye when she muttered, "And this is the nineteen-<em>seventies</em>, gran! It's nearly another decade, I can have a kid without being married…"</p><p>"My God, Lily, what will the neighbours think? Is this the influence of that – that – <em>that school</em> on you?" their grandmother cried, hand fluttering around her chest. "Oh, my heart. My poor heart."</p><p>"Oh, mum, stop it, you're being so dramatic," muttered Leonard, although the words were a bit garbled coming through his hands.</p><p>Marie sniffed. "Well, she's <em>your</em> daughter, Leonard – have a bit more respect for the situation she found herself in and the damage it will cause—"</p><p>"So, girls," Rose tried to inject some cheerful levity in her voice as it loudly carried over the table, even as she turned to Petunia and Hermione, "Pet, what was it you wanted to say?"</p><p>Petunia took a few moments to compose herself, although her chest was heaving and her nostrils flared in anger as she cut a nasty look toward Lily, who slouched in her seat. She let go of her tight hold on Hermione's hand but kept her icy glare on Lily when she said, her voice hard, "Sean and I are expecting."</p><p>"Expecting what?" asked Duncan.</p><p>Rose gasped, her eyes wide. "You're pregnant, too?!"</p><p>Leonard groaned.</p><p>Rose's eyes drifted from Petunia to Hermione. James smugly placed his arm around the back of her chair, his goofy, lopsided grin coming out as he announced, "Us, too! I'm going to be a dad!"</p><p>Stunned, Rose looked around the table at her three daughters, and stuttered out, "You're all pregnant? At the same time…?"</p><p>James blushed, his ear tips going red when he muttered, "I'm pretty sure it was the Halloween party we had at ours… I <em>knew</em> Sirius did something with the punch…"</p><p>"This wasn't <em>quite</em> how I wanted to announce it," bit out Petunia, eyes still lingering on Lily before she addressed the rest of the table. "Hermione and I found out together and we wanted to share it together, too."</p><p>"Oh, but that's just darling," gasped Marie, the lines on her face deepening as she smiled. "Three great-grandchildren all at once! Oh, Petunia, sweetheart, when are you due? Hermione, love?"</p><p>There was a lingering smell of vomit at the table now, mixing in with what remained of the potatoes and meat. It was highly unpleasant, and Hermione's nose twitched against the smell, and she wasn't sure if it was the question or the smell that made her stomach turn when she answered in a small voice, "July. We're all due in July."</p><p>Petunia's glare immediately turned to concern as she turned to Hermione.</p><p>"Well," boomed Humphrey, speaking for the first time since Lily threw up, "Congratulations are in order, then. Duncan, do you still have those cigars…? Perhaps us men should celebrate the fathers—"</p><p>"Oh, but what about Lily?" fussed Rose, turning back to her. "Are you seeing someone, Lily? Who's the father?"</p><p>"Yes, Lily," added Petunia, voice hard. "Who's the father?"</p><p>Lily blushed almost as red as her hair.</p><p>A horrifying thought crept across Hermione's mind and she immediately blurted, "Good <em>God</em>, please tell me it's not Snape."</p><p>At her side, James choked on the drink he just took.</p><p>"Snape?" echoed Leonard, "You don't mean that skinny boy from Spinner's End, do you?"</p><p>Coughing, James put down his glass and managed to say, "Just – just to say – but Snape is a person of interest in Hermione's kidnapping, so, <em>please</em> tell me you haven't seen him—"</p><p>"It's not Severus!" burst out Lily, crossing her arms. "Merlin – it's not anyone's business! We're not even dating! It was one time!" She blushed. "Okay, maybe more than one time…"</p><p>"I didn't need to hear that," groaned Leonard.</p><p>"Um, Lily, dear…" Rose looked around the table and her eyes caught on the bowl of vomit. Her nose wrinkled. "Let's… let's clear the table and take this to the kitchen, girls…"</p><p>"I've got it," offered Hermione, bringing out her wand.</p><p>Marie gave a sniff, but Humphrey took that as a signal and stood, Leonard quickly following him, hauling James to his feet. "To the back garden, men."</p><p>Startled, James shot Hermione a glance, but Sean was behind him, ushering him forward, and they, along with Humphrey and Duncan, quickly vacated the dining area and went through the backdoor into the back garden, leaving Hermione space to magic the dishes away to the kitchen.</p><p>As Marie and Rose turned to Lily to interrogate her, with Petunia adding her own acerbic opinions, Hermione sat back, lost in thought.</p><p>Was <em>this</em> what Harry had meant, back in the Room of Requirements? That he was always going to be born and that Lily was still going to be his mum?</p><p>What did it <em>mean</em> that she, Petunia, and Lily were all pregnant at the same time (also: she was going to hunt down Sirius and find out what he put in the punch, and whether any of the other couples were expecting…)?</p><p>Knowing that her due date was July 1980 was worrisome enough, but with three Evans sisters all expecting, plus the way things were lining up for her, had a frisson of fear settle in Hermione's stomach. She may have destroyed almost all Voldemort's Horcruxes, but she also had (theoretically) two of the Deathly Hallows. The Room's construct of Harry had spoken to her with a weight that sounded like a prophecy. Between her and James, they had defied Voldemort a few times.</p><p>Things were going too well – the scales were going to tip soon, and Hermione wasn't sure just how things would shake out when they did.</p><hr /><p align="center">{TBC…}</p>

  <strong>December 1979</strong>
</p><p>The air smelled like the cigars James, Sean, her uncle, father, and grandfather had smoked in the backyard after dinner, the sharp scent lingering around the door and patio set where the men had either stood or sat.</p><p>Hermione found Petunia glowering in the darkness; thin arms wrapped around her chest. She was sitting on the tiny stoop step between the house and patio stones, an air of malice hanging around her.</p><p>"You okay?"</p><p>Petunia didn't twitch her head in recognition of Hermione's voice, but she did sigh, the exhale leaving her body making her slump further until her chin was pressed against her knees, tucked tight around her. Hermione took that as a sign of invitation, but gave Petunia her space, opting to sit at the patio set instead. At that angle, she was able to look directly at her sister and back into the house.</p><p>"It as supposed to be <em>our</em> moment," muttered Petunia, a pinched look to her.</p><p>"I don't think it was planned, Tuney," said Hermione carefully. "She threw up. It wasn't like she could control that."</p><p>"She could've used magic," replied Petunia mulishly.</p><p>"It doesn't work like—" Hermione snapped her mouth shut. Okay, so puking pasties weren't <em>yet</em> invented by the Weasley twins, but there was no guarantee that someone else hadn't made a treat or candy that could mimic that in the 1970s. Although Hermione was certain Lily was not the type to go around creating prank products.</p><p>Petunia sighed, resting her chin on her knees as she turned to face Hermione. "Aren't you upset?"</p><p>"I think I'm more upset that <em>you're</em> upset," answered Hermione. "I'm fine with coasting along. I could've waited to tell mum and dad."</p><p>Petunia looked at Hermione, then, and opened her mouth –</p><p>"Can I join or… or is this a 'you two' thing?"</p><p>Hermione glanced up from Petunia at Lily, who hovered in the doorframe, the backdoor partially open and one foot on the patio stone and one still instead. Petunia twisted around to stare at Lily, a heavy glare forming on her face.</p><p>Reaching out, Hermione nudged Petunia's legs with her toe.</p><p>Petunia turned back to her youngest sister, glowering, but said nothing. Hermione took that as an implicit "okay," and smiled at Lily. "Come join us."</p><p>Hesitantly, and still looking a bit peaky, Lily slipped through the door and hovered closer to the house, leaning against the side of it.</p><p>The three were silent, with Hermione glancing between Lily and Petunia often, a tiny frown on her face. Finally, she asked, "So – are we going to talk about it, or what?"</p><p>"What's there to say?" muttered Petunia, shooting a glare at Lily.</p><p>"What?" their redheaded sister sputtered. "What did I do now?"</p><p>"<em>What did you do?</em>" echoed Petunia, shrilly. "I had this – this entire plan – and you just, you just-!" she mimicking gagging.</p><p>"Oh, <em>so sorry</em> that I disrupted Perfect Petunia's grand plan!" snapped Lily in retaliation. "Because <em>everything</em> must be exactly as Petunia says, doesn't it? That's how it's been our entire lives: Petunia says 'jump' and I don't have the chance to say 'no'; it's all 'how high?'"</p><p>Affronted, Petunia gasped and reared back. "How dare you—"</p><p>"How dare you!" shouted back Lily. "Nothing was ever good enough for you after I got my Hogwarts letter. Just because of it, being different from you, you thought me a freak!"</p><p>Their father stuck his head out of the backdoor, warily looking between his three daughters. "Everything alright, girls?"</p><p>"It's fine dad," said Hermione, trying to make a smile appear on her face. "Just Tuney and Lily hashing out some old hurts. I'll put up a privacy spell so no one can hear them shout."</p><p>Leo looked a bit concerned but nodded. "Alright, sweetheart."</p><p>Once he was gone, Hermione sent a sharp glare at both her sisters. "I'm fine with us discussing this and getting it done and over with, but let's be a bit more careful with the accusations in a Muggle neighbour, shall we?"</p><p>Petunia sniffed and Lily grumbled, but they agreed, and Hermione hastily threw up a modified ward based off Snape's <em>muffilato</em>, which Lily seemed to find impressive, given the look she sent her little sister.</p><p>"You're such a hypocritical bitch, Tuney," muttered Lily. "You scorn me for being this freak with magic, but you're all buddy-buddy with 'Mione—"</p><p>"To be fair," began Hermione quietly, "She did ignore me for years, too…"</p><p>"That's not the point!" shouted Lily, hands coming up to grab at her hair. She let out a tiny scream of frustration. "Tuney had this grand plan, this idea of how we would be together and if anything, or anyone, god forbid, causes her ten-year plan to derail, she's a bloody nightmare!"</p><p>"I do <em>not</em> have a ten-year plan!" Petunia stared hard at Lily.</p><p>"Really?" asked Hermione, eyebrows up in disbelief. "So, you haven't already planned your future kid's next few years, including already which nursery they'll attend?"</p><p>Petunia flushed a heavy red.</p><p>"I just don't get it," whispered Lily, eyes red-rimmed as she looked at the garden stones. "What did I do that made you both hate me so much?"</p><p>"I don't hate you!" retorted Hermione in shock.</p><p>"Nor do I," replied Petunia, brows furrowed in confusion.</p><p>Lily stared balefully at them. "But you… you both spend your time together, do everything together. I never get invited, I'm always last to find things out… it can't be magic, because you're fine with it around Hermione… what is it?"</p><p>"Have you looked in the mirror?" muttered Petunia, causing Hermione to elbow her in the side. "Oww!"</p><p>Stricken, Lily's eyes looked between the two. "Truly? <em>I'm</em> the problem?"</p><p>Hermione sighed. "It's… it's not that simple, Lily. Both Petunia and I have issues as well, so it's not all on you."</p><p>"It's mostly on you," interjected Petunia. At Hermione's glare, she shrugged. "What? It's true. As kids, she got away with everything. She was our parents' darling. Perfect Lily, the one we should both emulate. And then when she got her magic, she had that Snape boy violate my privacy – magic was always something bad for me then."</p><p>"I said sorry for that!" protested Lily, scowling. "And that's not fair, Petunia. You're still punishing me for something I did as a child!"</p><p>"Oh, well. Let's talk about when we grew up." Petunia sniffed haughtily. "You'd invite that boy over for Sunday dinner and he'd put frog spawn in my pockets or call me names and you never said anything! You picked <em>him</em> over your own family! You laughed when I found the frog slime in my pockets – I saved up <em>months</em> for the notes to be able to afford it!"</p><p>Lily was aghast. "I didn't—I didn't think—"</p><p>"That's kind of the problem," said Hermione quietly. "You thought a lot revolved around you, Lily. You didn't think about Tuney's feelings."</p><p>"I didn't know she saved up for it!" protested Lily. "That's not fair!"</p><p>"You never <em>asked</em>, did you?" sniffed Petunia. "You were never around anyway during the summer – always going off with that Snape boy—"</p><p>Lily moaned. "Why do you dislike him so much—"</p><p>"Everything he did was either to get or keep your attention, or keep your attention off others," continued Hermione calmly. "Think of his rivalry with James and his friends – and, and, despite falling into a crowd that would become Death Eaters, he still thought to maintain a friendship with you, calling everyone else mudbloods."</p><p>"What's a mudblood?" asked Petunia curiously, looking between the two, her long blonde hair swinging as her head moved.</p><p>"Dirty slang for impure and not worthy of magic," answered Lily quietly.</p><p>"It was a double-standard. Friends with you but you were the mudblood exception—"</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes. "Oh, come off it – like you and Black didn't have the same thing—"</p><p>"Reg <em>never</em> called me a mudblood," replied Hermione firmly. "Ever."</p><p>The sisters fell silent, each eyeing one another carefully. Finally, Hermione sighed, slumping her shoulders. "Look, every time I tried to invite you to do something, particularly after Petunia and I made up, you didn't want to meet us. So, I stopped inviting you and it was just me and Tuney who met up or spent time together. That's why we're closer."</p><p>Pained, Lily murmured, "I'm sorry."</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "It happens."</p><p>"You were mean and cruel about Hogwarts," said Petunia, a hard glint in her eyes. "I wanted to be <em>with</em> you. I wanted to keep us all together, and then you had to make fun of me. By making fun of the letter I sent Headmaster Dumbledore, you made fun of the fact that I loved you so much I wanted to go to the same school even though I <em>couldn't</em>."</p><p>Lily grimaced. "That wasn't – that wasn't what I meant or thought of—"</p><p>"But it was what Snape thought," sighed Hermione. "'Ooh, look, the stupid muggle with no magic wants to pretend to be a witch! What a riot!'"</p><p>"He was a bad influence on you," muttered Petunia stiffly.</p><p>Lily glanced between her two sisters. "Did neither of you think about how it felt being me? The first with magic in the family, and there I was, prime to take Petunia's role for you, Hermione. To show you everything that I loved about the world – but you weren't interested."</p><p>Petunia turned away quickly so that Lily couldn't see the face she was making.</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "I wanted to do my own thing. I always have. Why would Hogwarts change that?"</p><p>"You could have told me," scowled Lily.</p><p>"Oh, please," groaned Hermione, "You were so enthused about the idea, constantly telling me how much I would love Gryffindor. You kept pushing on me what <em>you</em> were interested in and what <em>you</em> loved instead of thinking about me."</p><p>"And back to Lily thinking only of herself," muttered Petunia.</p><p>"I don't think of myself!" Lily stamped her foot in frustration. "I have friends – I'd do anything for them – and I'm outgoing, all the teachers at Hogwarts <em>loved</em> me –"</p><p>"You would do whatever you could to make mum and daddy love you," spat Petunia, just as Hermione said, "Yeah, no, you were a teacher's pet, Lily, of course, they were going to love you—"</p><p>"I got up in trouble, too," she muttered mulishly, pouting at her older and younger sister equally, crossing her arms. "I'm not perfect—"</p><p>"You just <em>pretend</em> you are and it's kind of aggravating," said Hermione slowly and carefully. "No one is. Goodness knows I am very aware of my faults, and Tuney's. You just pretend to not have any and then impose on the rest of us these lofty, impractical expectations."</p><p>"I thought expectations were Petunia's thing."</p><p>Hermione stifled a snort. "You both do that."</p><p>Petunia rolled her eyes, fighting against a smile and Lily left a few giggles out. It diffused the tension between them.</p><p>"I can't forget what you did," said Petunia slowly, "But I can forgive it going forward so long as you don't do the same mistakes."</p><p>Lily shyly looked at Petunia from under her lashes. "You'll tell me if I'm repeating bad habits?"</p><p>Petunia sniffed. "Of course."</p><p>"Truce?" Lily held out a hand toward Petunia. Hermione's breath caught and she held it in as she watched with wide eyes.</p><p>Petunia eyed the hand and stood from the patio steps. For one moment, Hermione thought that she would not take Lily's extended offer when she knocked Lily's hand away. Lily gasped, but then Petunia was leaning in and hugging Lily, eyes closed.</p><p>"You'll always be my sister, even when you're annoying me," Petunia murmured. "Even if you annoy me for <em>years</em> on end."</p><p>Lily gave a wet laugh, hugging Petunia back tightly, her fingers digging into Petunia's bony shoulders. "I'm sorry – I wish we hadn't drifted so far apart that it came to this – that I didn't see—"</p><p>Petunia scoffed, drawing back a bit. "I'm sorry I let my pride get the best of me. I am the oldest – I should have spoken to you about my feelings."</p><p>The two sisters smiled wobbly at one another, and Hermione sniffed, blinking rapidly to hide her own tears of happiness. Petunia and Lily turned to her, Lily laughing as she held a free arm out invitingly. "C'mon, 'Mione, it's your turn too! Join in the hug!"</p><p>Hermione did not need a further invitation and stepped forward, breathing in the scent of her two sisters as their hair mingled red, brown, and blonde when their foreheads touched: Petunia and Hermione cheek to cheek and Lily's forehead resting against their chins.</p><p>They remained like that for some time, basking in the feel of each other's arms. Hermione knew she was hopeful that Lily and Petunia would mend their rift; they hadn't in the previous timeline, and it badly showed in how Harry had been treated. If the worst were to happen—</p><p><em>No,</em> she thought, <em>I won't think that way. Not right now. Not when we're like this.</em></p><p>After a few more moments, petunia drew back, rubbing at her arms. "I think I'm going to go inside now and tell Sean I'm ready to go to his parent's."</p><p>Lily and Hermione both made affirming noises, and Petunia bid them goodnight, leaving the two witches standing on the patio stones in the cool evening air, no longer smelling of cigars. After a moment of watching Petunia inside the kitchen disappear through the door and down the hallway, Hermione turned to Lily with a questioning brow raised.</p><p>"What?" asked Lily.</p><p>"Really, though, it's not Snape, is it?" asked Hermione with a slightly green hue to her face.</p><p>"Great <em>Merlin</em>, Hermione!" Lily cried, glaring at her. "Why does everyone think it's Severus?"</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "Gosh, I wonder why."</p><p>Lily scowled. She turned away to stare at the muddy field next to their house, stewing in her anger until eventually, she sighed, and her shoulders slumped. "I had hoped…"</p><p>"Hoped?"</p><p>"That after… when we made up in the library," continued Lily quietly, lost in her memories. "We, well, after graduation we kept up a correspondence and even saw each other a few times. But—"</p><p>Hermione made a noise of interest.</p><p>"But after you were attacked at Malfoy Manor…" Lily shook her head, tears in her eyes when she turned to Hermione. "How could I justify his actions? I had spent so many years, so much time and effort into telling everyone I knew that he wasn't all that bad – that Severus would <em>never</em> do those things… and then… he did. He tried to – to maim my own sister."</p><p>Hermione chewed on her bottom lip. Tentatively, she offered, "I do think you're the exception to his rules, Lil."</p><p>"I shouldn't be." She shook her head, eyes sad and downcast. "The things he's done, and what he's yet to do in the service of a mad man…" She turned to Hermione. "He had every opportunity to move beyond his hurts and never did."</p><p>"Some chips on the shoulder are just too big to ignore, I suppose," offered Hermione quietly.</p><p>"That's not the answer," replied Lily, a bit heatedly. "It's never the answer."</p><p>The two were quiet for a few minutes, just breathing in the cold December air despite not feeling the cold from their warming charms. Their breaths puffed out before them, and Hermione spent the time with her head tilted back, looking up at the stars.</p><p>"You always knew, didn't you?"</p><p>Hermione turned to Lily, to find her sister watching her carefully. "Hmm?"</p><p>"You avoided certain people, all your life," continued Lily, a tiny frown on her face. "Severus was one of them. Ever since you met him, you disliked him or went out of your way to ignore him. You always knew he was going to be trouble."</p><p>"Maybe not trouble," replied Hermione carefully, "But I had a feeling that he wouldn't be the type to change." Hermione gave a tiny laugh. "The power of love can't compel someone to do good things, Lily."</p><p>"I thought it might heal him," she sighed.</p><p>"Only he could do that," said Hermione, heaving a sigh of her own. She nudged her shoulder into her sister's. "And 'sides, it's not your job to heal him."</p><p>Lily fell into silence then, for a little longer, before muttering, "I'm going inside. Are you… are you coming?"</p><p>"Not yet," answered Hermione quietly. "Soon."</p><p>Lily nodded, and stood from the chair, placing a warm hand on Hermione's shoulder, only to draw her in quickly for a hug, despite their sitting and standing positions. Lily's floral scent invading Hermione's nose, and for a brief, shining moment, it was like being six again and her big sister was hugging her, for no other reason than she could and wanted to express her love. Then Lily was gone, and Hermione was left outside.</p><p>It wasn't long after Lily returned to the warmth of their parents' home that the backdoor opened again, and a heavier set of feet made their way toward her. James heavily sat in Lily's seat, separated from Hermione by the wrought iron table.</p><p>His face was shrouded in the darkness, with the only light coming from the kitchen window behind them and the backdoor, illuminating his unruly black hair and shadowing his eyes. But Hermione knew he was looking at her.</p><p>"I think I've always known," he began slowly, carefully, and Hermione turned to look at her husband.</p><p>He didn't move to take her hand or move in any way. He was still, like a statue, but there was something hot, knowing, in what she could see of his hazel eyes.</p><p>"I think I've always known," he repeated. "That something was just… different about you. I never really thought much of it, because at first, you were just the incredibly intelligent, rude, younger girl who was tutoring me in Arithmancy. But you'd say something or have this look in your eyes – and I would think to myself, <em>she knows more than what she's saying</em>."</p><p>Hermione tilted her chin down in a single, acknowledging nod.</p><p>Triumph lit in James' eyes and he rushed to continue. "But you weren't a politically minded Slytherin, so that was weird. You weren't scheming, like mum. And then we'd talk more, and we'd do more, and I got to know you better and it didn't matter that you were… different. Then, we were dating and… I found myself falling in love with you."</p><p>He laughed, finally moving as he brought a hand up to cover his mouth. "Actually, it wasn't so much as falling as utterly tripping, given how I made a fool of myself."</p><p>"You were hardly a fool," Hermione lightly admonished.</p><p>"It felt like it," he replied shaking his head. "And when I would think I had you all figured out, and then I would see you using magic like I've never in the Room of Requirements, or when you out-duelled Voldemort's supporters. Or how you just… knew things about other people."</p><p>Hermione pressed her lips together, refusing to speak.</p><p>James turned his body to face Hermione's. "I think… after Crouch and Reg's reaction to the Godric's Hollow house, and then your reaction to the Headmaster's offer, I think… I think I knew. I just didn't want to admit it, because… well, even with magic, it's… farfetched." He gave a tiny laugh.</p><p>Hermione swallowed a lump in her throat, and she hoarsely asked, "What do you know?"</p><p>"You're a seer," said James carefully, eyes tracing Hermione's features, "But given how much you hate divination, that can't be it. So, if a seer is out, the only way you'd have all the knowledge and experience you do is if you're already done all this before, Hermione."</p><p>Hearing the truth from James's lips was like a sledgehammer in Hermione's chest. She closed her eyes, pained, and wondered if this was the moment, she'd lose her husband, lose the solid rock he'd become over the years, the foundation of which she based her hopes on that she could fix things, that if she could change <em>just one more thing</em>, that she wouldn't see her sister lying dead at the base of a cradle, that James wouldn't be gone from the world.</p><p>She cleared her throat, opened her eyes, and spoke the truth. "Yes."</p><p>James froze. "Yes…?"</p><p>"I've… I've done this before, but… not how you're thinking," she admitted quietly.</p><p>James exhaled, loudly, leaning back in the chair. He blinked and ran a hand through his hair. "I – wow – I'd… I never thought you'd actually… <em>admit</em> it."</p><p>Hermione sent him a scathing look, and at it, he blanched.</p><p>"I thought I was going a bit mad, thinking it, to be honest," he said, with a tiny cringe. "So, uh, thanks for clearing that up."</p><p>They sat in silence for a bit.</p><p>"Will you… will you tell me about it?" James quietly asked, eyes boring into her.</p><p>"It's not a happy story," Hermione repeated the words she used for Regulus and Barty, for Petunia and Sean.</p><p>"It's your story," replied James firmly, reaching out and taking Hermione's hand. "That's good enough for me. And… I want to understand."</p><p>Hermione blinked rapidly, trying to ignore the tears forming, and sniffed. "Alright…"</p><p>Like with her sister, with her best friends, Hermione began retelling her life as Hermione Granger, growing up in the 1980s and her two best friends, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley…</p><p>By the time she finished, James had wordlessly renewed their warming charms twice, and the lights in the house behind them had all been turned off but the kitchen, signalling everyone else had gone to bed or left. The stars were still out, and the air was still chilly, but the moon was further across the sky than when she first began, and there was a tired air between them as she finished.</p><p>James remained silent the entire time, listening to her recount her experiences, not once asking questions although she could see them burning in his eyes. Whenever she got to a harrowing part about herself or Harry, he'd grip her hand tightly or grind his teeth, but never spoke.</p><p>Finally, he said, "Crouch and Regulus already know, don't they? And… Petunia?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>There was a tiny quirk to his lips, a gleam in his eyes. "So, I'm the fourth."</p><p>Hermione paused. "Er…"</p><p>James frowned. "Wait, I'm <em>not</em> the fourth to know?"</p><p>"Er… well… I mean…" Hermione cleared her throat, eyes darting away from James. "Sean knows because Tuney knows."</p><p>There was a scowl on James' face. "So, I'm the <em>fifth</em> to know? Hermione! I'm your husband!"</p><p>Hermione winced. "Yeah…"</p><p>James' scowl deepened and he withdrew his hand and pout and cross his arms across his chest, slouching in his seat as he sent her a dirty look.</p><p>Backpedalling, Hermione rushed to soothe his ego. "To be fair, Tuney and Sean only know <em>parts</em> – they don't know everything. And Lily <em>definitely</em> doesn't know anything. If we're basing it on that, then you're the third."</p><p>James stared at her for a bit longer, grumbling under his breath before he spoke. "… fine. I'll take that."</p><p>He stewed for a moment longer, and then turned to her, eyes alight with some smugness. "That's much better than fourth or fifth. Hermione, I don't think I'd have been able to handle it if you told others. Especially <em>Sirius</em> before me! Could you imagine?"</p><p>There was something in his eyes that made Hermione's breath catch: something fierce, but curious, but also determined. He looked around the Evans' back garden. "So… do you want to stay here and talk, or can I ask you all the questions I have from the comfort of our bed?"</p><p>Relief spread through Hermione's body and she physically slumped in her seat; eyes closed. When she opened them again, they caught James's and his turned molten as he caught her expression.</p><p>"Bed. Definitely."</p><p>Hand on hers, they both stood from the chairs and with a sharp, loud crack, disapparated to their townhome. They got to James's questions…</p><p>Eventually.</p><hr /><p>Petunia met James and Hermione a few days before New Years' outside the Haberdashery in the alley between the two tall buildings. She was clutching her purse when James and Hermione apparated in, a pop signalling their appearance. She inhaled sharply upon seeing them and then sniffed.</p><p>"Is this it then?" asked James, a sparkle in his eyes visible from behind his glasses even as he rocked back and forth on his heels in excitement.</p><p>"Oh, she finally told you, I see," commented Petunia.</p><p>James grinned. "Kept her up <em>all night</em> answering questions."</p><p>Petunia's eyes narrowed between the two. "It's a wonder you only got pregnant now, Hermione."</p><p>"Shut up," the curly-haired witch said without heat, turning to the nondescript door. She pressed a hand flat against it and murmured, "Jelly babies and a TARDIS."</p><p>"A what?" asked James.</p><p>Petunia sniggered. "Really, Hermione?"</p><p>Hermione shrugged. The door under her hand glowed a muted golden colour and then faded. There was a click as the door unlocked. "It's not like an enemy of ours is going to know that, will they?"</p><p>James pestered Hermione for what she meant – and left Petunia up to explain a television show they watched when still living at home, <em>Doctor Who</em>, to him. It left James baffled about the idea of a time and space travelling alien.</p><p>Then they were up the stairs and through the second door with another password ("Abracadabra," which made James shudder) and into the large sitting area of Alphard Black's haberdashery workshop. Regulus and Barty were already there, Barty scarfing down take-out and perched on his haunches on a chair while Regulus stood with his hands in his robe pockets before a large, empty space of wall next to the door.</p><p>Both turned to greet Hermione and then paused at seeing those with her. Hermione's voice was quiet when she said, "James knows, and Tuney wanted to help."</p><p>Barty nodded, taking it in stride.</p><p>Regulus eyed them both. "Help how?"</p><p>"Well, I brought more information I found on Tom Riddle," began Petunia, reaching into her purse and withdrawing some folded sheets of A4. "I thought we could add it to what I sent previously."</p><p>Between her and Regulus – and James, with his transfiguration skills – they began setting up an information board, using sticking charms on sheets of paper and photographs Petunia, as well as Regulus and Barty, had collected regarding Tom Riddle and his Death Eaters. Newspaper clippings on mysterious deaths, transcripts, and handwritten notes about Wizengamot sessions, even James's additions from Auror reports, all began to spread across the wall. Pieces were connected by string and make-shift post-its, with hastily scribbled thoughts. There was an entire section on his horcruxes and the two that were left: the diary and cup.</p><p>James had his over robe off, and his shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows, revealing his hairy arms. He had an ankle resting across the opposite knee in a languid pose. Hermione had trouble drawing her eyes away when he leaned back in his chair and asked, "How are you planning on getting these?"</p><p>Regulus sighed. "Well, after the Malfoy Manor fiasco—"</p><p>"Is that what we're calling it?" muttered Barty, moving to flop heavily onto the leather couch next to Hermione. He hooked an arm around the back and used it as leverage to turn and face Regulus.</p><p>"—there's no way we can plan anything around that," finished Regulus with a glare. "So, we should focus on the cup."</p><p>"Which is…" Petunia trailed off, thumbing through her hand-written notes, "In the bank?"</p><p>"Gringotts?" said James, incredulously as he leaned forward, both feet hitting the floor. "You're planning on robbing <em>Gringott's</em>?"</p><p>"'Rob' is such a dirty word," said Regulus, tilting his nose up the tiniest amount. He buffed his fingers on his robes. "'Liberate' is much better."</p><p>James pursed his lips to hide his grin. "Right – so, how do you plan on <em>liberating</em> the horcrux from Gringott's?" He cut a glance toward his wife, who was frowning in concentration with her fingers steepled and pressed against her mouth and her eyes staring unseeingly on his chest. "Surely you're not planning Polyjuice, two-point-oh."</p><p>Petunia slowly turned her head to stare at her sister while Barty chortled next to Hermione. Regulus looked pained. "I'd really rather not see Hermione looking like cousin Bella."</p><p>"I thought I did a good impression, at the time," muttered Hermione, blinking as she came out of her stupor. She sighed. "But no – the Polyjuice plan only worked because of the situation at hand, and once we went through Thief's Downfall, it washed away all enchantments, anyway. It was a desperate plan during desperate days."</p><p>"We're not quite there yet, either," added Regulus. He eyed her. "But if we do need you, it'll be to take Polyjuice again—"</p><p>"Absolutely not!"</p><p>Everyone's eyes shot to James, who had jumped to his feet. His eyes were hard on his best mate's little brother. "Polyjuice is <em>not</em> happening!"</p><p>"But Hermione has the most experience with it—" protested Regulus again, frowning.</p><p>"No!" James was adamant, a scowl now pulling at his mouth. "It's not safe!"</p><p>From the corner of his eyes, he saw Barty leaned toward Hermione and mutter, although it was loud enough for everyone to hear, "I thought you said you told him everything…?"</p><p>Hermione, however, was focused on James, a grim look on her face that made her seem much older.</p><p>"But-!" Regulus tried one last time, but this time James slashed a hand down aggressively when he spat to the room at large:</p><p>"I'll not endanger my unborn child, Black!"</p><p>Immediately, both Regulus and Barty sharply inhaled, turning as one toward Hermione with wide eyes. Barty had drastically paled, eyes skimming Hermione's form and her oversized jumper, peering intently at her midsection like she was about a balloon in size.</p><p>Regulus, however, had a tremble to him and his lips when he asked, "Is it true, Hermione? Is Potter speaking true?"</p><p>Hermione gave a tiny dip of her chin.</p><p>Regulus shakily exhaled, his eyes closing. Then, when they opened, they were molten silver. "This is over, now."</p><p><em>What?</em> "What's over?"</p><p>"This. It's done."</p><p>Hermione stared at Regulus, and he waved a hand around the room and at their information board, where Petunia still stood, a silent witness.</p><p>"<em>Excuse me?</em>" Hermione's voice was icy when she moved off the couch to stand.</p><p>Regulus stood firm though, meeting her eyes and ire, even as sparks began to climb through her curls. Petunia's mouth dropped open in fascination and surprise.</p><p>"You're pregnant, Hermione," said Regulus carefully, but there was a hint of Black arrogance to him, and he sounded eerily like his father. When he threw his shoulders back and tilted his chin up and looked eerily like Orion Black, too. "You can no longer join us on the hunt to destroy these. You have an heir to think of – and you've told Barty and me what we need to know. We'll finish this."</p><p>"The hell you will!" Hermione spat. "You wouldn't even <em>know</em> of this if it weren't for me!"</p><p>"You're pregnant, you shouldn't be near such dark magic!" retorted Regulus sharply.</p><p>"I'm not an invalid!"</p><p>"You're a <em>liability</em>."</p><p>Hermione reeled back, hurt across her face.</p><p>"Whoa," interrupted James, physically separating himself between Hermione and Regulus, both of who were breathing heavily with flushed faces. "Calm down, both of you."</p><p>He shuffled Hermione back to the couch, and she sat, stiffly. He knelt before his wife and glanced between her and Regulus, often. Regulus moved to the bar in the far corner of the room, well away from them.</p><p>"Regulus has a point about the magic, love," said James carefully, catching Hermione's dark eyes as she glared at the youngest Black son. She then transferred that glare to James, but he was immune to it by this point. "But Hermione also has a point that she got you this far, Regulus."</p><p>"Compromise?" piped up Barty, inching closer to Hermione's side, eyes darting from her to Regulus and back. But it was clear he was going to listen to Hermione with how he was positioned on the couch, hovering on the seats and tense.</p><p>"Hermione and Petunia can both provide information given they are both expecting," offered James, causing Barty and Regulus to glance at Petunia in surprise. She limply waved a hand and then turned her back on the drama, pretending to intently inspect the board. "While the three of us can do the magic part. And we'll keep it away from them, too."</p><p>"That sounds fair," agreed Barty with a tenuous grin at James.</p><p><em>Success!</em> thought James. He had finally found a crack into Hermione's best friend accepting him.</p><p>"Very well," agreed Regulus, stiffly through barely moving lips. He proceeded to then pour himself an alcoholic drink of some kind in a short glass, swishing the liquid around.</p><p>Hermione sighed. "Fine."</p><p>They were all silent for a bit.</p><p>"So. Uh, Gringott's, yeah?" muttered James, awkwardly.</p><p>Hermione sighed, again. "We have an in we can use."</p><p>Regulus perked up. "We do?"</p><p>"Dirk," replied Hermione. "He works in the Goblin Liaison Office in the Ministry. He can help us."</p><p>James's lips curled into a smile and Regulus nodded, once, as though that was an acceptable solution.</p><p>Only Barty seemed put out, pouting, "So no plan to steal a dragon? Boring."</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>January 1980</strong>
</p><p>The Ministry had not changed since the last time Hermione had stepped foot in it – a few decades in the future and a few decades in her past. There were still memos zooming above her head, the walls were still a pale gold, the carpet beneath her shoes was plush, and there were nervous glances made by harried and worried witches and wizards that kept their heads down as they rushed from one location to the next.</p><p>Voldemort's reign of terror was beginning to sink in now: sometimes, he'd attack – on equinoxes, on other special days – but mostly? To sink his claws in the people he needed to change policy, to learn the information he wanted, he would have his Death Eaters kidnap and torture (like they'd tried with her, Regulus, and Barty), or would place others under the Imperius curse. Trust was at an all-time low in the Ministry, and it was no wonder that Barty's father was pushing for stronger measures against Death Eaters.</p><p>But the Goblin Liaison office was a bit less tense than anywhere else. Perhaps it was because dealing with goblins on a daily was a thankless and terse job, but the people there were entirely too cheerful for Hermione when she stepped in, looking around for Dirk.</p><p>She spotted his dark head bent over some parchment at a desk in the middle of the office, partitioned off by familiar muggle-looking cubbies. As a new grunt, Dirk's office was in a terrible location of high traffic and next to a gurgling rubbish bin that burped at her when she strode up.</p><p>Leaning against the cubby wall, Hermione grinned, "Seems like those eight N.E.W.T.s really paid off."</p><p>Dirk startled, glancing up as his glasses slid down his nose. Spotting Hermione, he snorted and rolled his eyes. "It was less the N.E.W.T.s and more the fluent Gobbledegook I speak."</p><p>He rolled his chair back a bit and asked, "What brings you by, Hermione?"</p><p>Hermione grinned at her friend, eyes roving his desk: the messy parchment, the discarded quills and one tipped over inkpot; a few sealed scrolls in letterboxes on the far side, and the enchanted memo paper on a tiny shelf. Tucked in a corner, shadowed by the shelf, was a framed photograph from the Halloween party she and James had thrown that past October.</p><p>"May I?" she asked, pointing at it.</p><p>Dirk nodded, passing it over.</p><p>"Oh, wow," she breathed, taking it in. "I hadn't even realized someone was taking this."</p><p>The picture itself was busy: there were several people in the frame, but they were all stationary despite the wizarding nature of the image. It was easy to tell each person, though, despite their costumes: the Evans sisters were goddesses, Hermione and Petunia in togas and Lily in an owl mask; James had antlers to represent his animagus, as did the other Marauders; and here and there dotted others in masks and feathers.</p><p>Hermione was curled at James' side, laughing at something Petunia and Sean expressed. Sirius was warily looking around behind James, near the food, with Peter egging him on; Remus was listening to something Lily was saying as they, along with Dirk and Marlene, were listening intently, with Dirk having the most intense look on his face as he paid attention.</p><p>It was everyone Hermione had come to grow to care about, in some shape or another, in one image.</p><p>"It was a pretty chaotic night," agreed Dirk with a grin. "I'm certain Sirius spiked—"</p><p>"—the punch? Oh, yeah," finished Hermione with a grimace, glancing at the photographic version of Sirius glancing over his shoulder and then winking at the camera. "This is lovely, though. Are there any more copies? Who took it?"</p><p>"Braithwaite took it," answered Dirk, "That mousy looking Hufflepuff? The one that was friends with Diggory and Smith – I think there was a conversation about New Years' parties…?"</p><p>Hermione gave a tiny huff of a laugh. "I know her. I'll ask for a copy or some others of the evening."</p><p>"Sounds good," agreed Dirk, leaning back in his seat. "Now, why don't you tell me why you're really here?"</p><p>Hermione widened her eyes. "What makes you think I'm here for something?"</p><p>"Cut the crap, Hermione," retorted Dirk. "I know you. So, what is it?"</p><p>"Fine," scowled Hermione, moving from the wall to step closer. She furtively looked around, and while his coworkers were busy with their own work, she lowered her voice. "I need to retrieve something from a Gringott's vault without getting killed."</p><p>Dirk began laughing, even going so far as to slap a hand against his thigh. Then, it trailed off when her face didn't change. "What?"</p><p>"I need to—"</p><p>"I heard you the first time, but I had hoped someone slipped me an experimental potion to hallucinate," snapped Dirk, face hard. His eyes darted around the room. "Are you suicidal? Robbing <em>them</em>?"</p><p>"It's important."</p><p>Dirk rolled his eyes. "So is your <em>life</em>! What would Potter say—"</p><p>"He knows about this," interrupted Hermione calmly, making Dirk snap his mouth shut. "We had another plan, but it was considered too risky. So, I thought I would ask you how we could get the goblins on our side without robbing them."</p><p>Dirk sputtered, "Y-your s-side—"</p><p>"What do they want that I can give them?" continued Hermione, ignoring her friend. "I won't give them wands – but the artifact I need is potential goblin-made. They can have it once the Dark Magic is purged—"</p><p>"You're having a laugh." Dirk's eyes were round.</p><p>"C'mon, Dirk, give me something here," pleaded Hermione, lowering her voice and stepping closer. "I need something. They don't meddle in wizard affairs but they are greedy little money-grabbers, and everyone has a price."</p><p>Dirk's eyes narrowed. "Why are you so adamant about this? I know you're not—" he took a deep breath and looked around the room, lowering his own voice to just above a breathy exhale, "Part of Dumbledore's Order, so why are you so interested in this artifact in Gringott's?"</p><p>Hermione paused, her hand coming up to rub at her aching collarbone. "It's to stop <em>him</em>."</p><p>Dirk froze. "You know how to…?"</p><p>Hermione gave a slow, tiny nod.</p><p>"Is that why he went after…?"</p><p>She shook her head. "He doesn't know."</p><p>Exhaling shakily, Dirk fell back into his muggle roots. "Jesus Christ, Hermione. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph – <em>what have you been up to?</em>"</p><p>Hermione's mouth flattened into a tight line. "What we've had to."</p><p>"Crouch and Black," groaned Dirk, slipping in his chair and resting his head against the back. "Of course."</p><p>"What about speculation?" offered Hermione, back to the topic. "A month of arithmancy to predict muggle stocks for each minute in the vault in question?"</p><p>Dirk shook his head. "You don't get it – they don't care about that. You're magical, I'm magical… even me going to them outside Ministerial purview would be just as bad, Hermione. It can't be done. They won't accept any deals unless it's significantly tipped in their favour and then they'd just kill you anyway after delivery."</p><p>Hermione's mouth turned further down into a deep frown.</p><p>"Honestly, the only way into the vault in question is to have the owner or a family member go in and retrieve the item," sighed Dirk, running a hand through his messy hair. He peered at her. "Is there someone you can ask to do that?"</p><p><em>Baby Lestrange</em>, her mind supplied instantly, a sour thought that echoed on her face. "Yeah."</p><p>"Then you need to get them on your side and have them retrieve it," said Dirk.</p><p>"Is that your expert advice as a goblin liaison?" asked Hermione seriously.</p><p>He nodded. "It's the only way."</p><p>Hermione sighed.</p><p>"Sorry," winced Dirk. "I know it's not what you wanted to hear—"</p><p>She shrugged. "I didn't want to rob the place or breakout on dragonback, so I guess this works. I'll make it work."</p><p>Alarmed, Dirk weakly echoed, "<em>Dragonback</em>?" but Hermione was already thinking ahead, ignoring him. She gave him a tight smile.</p><p>"Thank you for your help," she said, patting him on the shoulder. "I appreciate it. I know we haven't really spoken recently, so we should catch up with lunch."</p><p>Even though his heart was thundering with the idea of Hermione robbing Gringott's and escaping on a dragon, Dirk managed to weakly nod and gasp, "Sounds good. There's a good sushi place I know—"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "Sorry, can't. No raw fish for me until late summer."</p><p>"What? Why?"</p><p>Carefully, Hermione's hands fluttered around her midsection, Dirk's eyes dropping to follow the movement. He stood suddenly, chair rolling backward. His eyes were wide when he whispered through bloodless lips, "<em>You're pregnant?</em>"</p><p>"Blame Sirius and the punch," groused Hermione. "Not only was I pissed out of my mind, I'm sure whatever combination he used frizzled out any magical forms of birth control. Tuney and Lily are also pregnant, and so is Alice Longbottom – and all three were at the party."</p><p>Dirk's face paled. "Oh – oh, wow…"</p><p>"That's a word for it," Hermione rolled her eyes. "Thanks again, Dirk. I'll owl you and we'll find somewhere else for lunch."</p><p>As she walked away, she heard Dirk weakly say goodbye behind her. She bit her lip, her brain processing and coming up with plans to bring Rabastan to their side. It looked like it was Regulus's turn to helm a mission.</p><hr /><p>On a Thursday morning, Regulus left the Haberdashery with a scowl on his face while Barty, James, and Hermione remained behind. Barty was offering baby names, playfully, like he didn't know that Hermione already had a name in mind while James was enthusiastically rhapsodizing about what a great Quidditch player his child was going to be.</p><p>By Thursday evening, as the sun was going down and the three were becoming antsy, Regulus, scowl in place, returned to the Haberdashery, a pale- and shame-faced Rabastan trailing him silently.</p><p>Barty slowly stood. "What is he—"</p><p>Rabastan reached into a cloth bag at his side and withdrew Hufflepuff's goblet, placing it on the coffee table in front of the couch where its golden stem gleamed in the room's light even as the fireplace rippled and dimmed.</p><p>Hermione blinked while James looked between the goblet and the younger Lestrange. "I – what – that seemed a bit—"</p><p>"Too easy?" finished Barty grimly. He was staring hard at the youngest wizard in the room. "You don't say."</p><p>"He was already feeling bad about the portkey last summer," sighed Regulus, throwing himself into his usual armchair. "And was attempting to drown his guilt in a seedy Knockturn bar when I found him. Was easy enough to sober the kid up when I told him I needed his help."</p><p>"And you went along with it?" asked Hermione, looking at Rabastan in confusion. "Just like that?"</p><p>Rabastan jerked his chin down in a single nod. He licked at his chapped lips and stuttered, "I can't be one of them – I can't – I'm <em>not that person</em>."</p><p>Barty snorted in disbelief. "Oh, so <em>now</em> Baby Lestrange isn't that person – after we nearly died—"</p><p>"Barty," admonished Hermione gently, but then she turned to Regulus, perplexed.</p><p>He shrugged, an elegant, one-shoulder move. "Goblins didn't have a single problem with me accompanying a Lestrange into their family vault."</p><p>"Huh." Hermione made a face.</p><p>Nervously, Rabastan asked, "So… uh… what's… what's so important about this…?"</p><p>"It's a dark artifact," revealed Hermione slowly.</p><p>"But it's… it's Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, isn't it?" Rabastan looked at the group. "I mean, it is, right?"</p><p>"It is," confirmed James, still staring at the cup in equal parts disgust and fascination. Hermione noticed and elbowed him. "Ow!"</p><p>"Stop it," she hissed.</p><p>"I can't help it," whined James, rubbing at the spot. "It's like it's pulling me in!"</p><p>"That's what they do," sighed Regulus wearily.</p><p>"Merlin," James shook his head. "How did you lot manage three others of these?"</p><p>"Three what?" echoed Rabastan, in increasing confusion.</p><p>"Hermione should be far away," spoke Barty, over Rabastan as he shared a look with Regulus. The witch in question scowled, but at James's pleading look, she sighed and moved to the furthest part of the room, behind the bar and away from the cup.</p><p>"Baby Lestrange, go with her," instructed Barty, not taking his eyes off the cup as he slowly inched his wand into his palm.</p><p>Rabastan scowled, but at Regulus's glare, he moved to stand at Hermione's side, although he made sure not to touch her.</p><p>"Want the honours, Potter?" asked Regulus, reaching for their diminished vial of basilisk venom, with only a few drops left.</p><p>Warily, James took the vial. "All I have to do is pour this on it?"</p><p>Regulus nodded, but Barty said, seriously, "It'll fight back. Don't listen to it, don't look at it – just do it."</p><p>The room's temperature dropped further and the shadows around the room elongated and flickered. Everyone shivered and looked at the cup.</p><p>"On three?" asked Regulus, grimly.</p><p>"Three," confirmed James and Barty.</p><p>"One," began the youngest Black, as Barty snapped his wand up at the cup and James took a step closer.</p><p>"Two…"</p><p>The shadows lengthened further, and the fire whittled down to a dull red, sending the room into semi-darkness and a strange, eerie, red sheen.</p><p>"One…"</p><p>A shade erupted from the cup with an ear-deafening scream, but James darted forward and tipped the venom into the bowl of the cup and the scream turned into a wail as something sizzled.</p><p>Then, warmth returned to the room as the fire steadily grew into a friendly yellow and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>"It's done," announced Regulus.</p><p>James, his entire frame tense and frozen, boneless slumped and fell backwards into the couch, the back of his knees bumping into the arm. He was shaking as he ran a trembling hand through his hair. "How did you manage that so many other times?"</p><p>"Sadly, you start to get used to it," replied Barty. "The first was the worst, though."</p><p>Regulus was prodding at the cup, muttering under his breath. "It's clean. The horcrux is gone."</p><p>There was relief and the freeing of the last of the tension in the room as small smiles began to appear on their faces.</p><p>But then, from the bar, Rabastan's trembling voice asked, "W-what, what <em>was</em> that?"</p><p>"That was a horcrux," explained Hermione quietly, as she stepped around the young wizard and the bar. "A piece of the Dark Lord's soul in a vessel."</p><p>Rabastan's eyes went wide, darting at the cup in fear. "His <em>soul</em>? To—"</p><p>"To return if he ever died," explained Regulus. "It's very dark magic."</p><p>Horrified, Rabastan stuttered in a quiet, breathless voice, "And he made… <em>three others</em>?"</p><p>Hermione, Barty, and Regulus shared a look, which then included James at the last moment.</p><p>"No," said Barty, a bit sharp, "He made five, not including himself."</p><p>Rabastan clutched the edges of the bar to keep himself upright. "Five?"</p><p>Barty went to scoop the cup in the bag Rabastan brought, with Hermione at his side and James at hers, peering curiously at the thing. It left Regulus to attempt to draw Rabastan out from behind the bar, which he did by offering him a tea from the enchanted teapot left by the other three to the side while they waited.</p><p>"Here, drink something warm," instructed Regulus, passing the mug to Rabastan, who clutched at the ceramic.</p><p>Fearfully, Rabastan asked, "Why are you doing this?"</p><p>"Because no one else was," he replied quietly.</p><p>Something appeared in Rabastan's blue eyes. Something like determination. "I will. I'll help." He then looked away, a flush on his cheeks. "I need to make up for… for the portkey anyway."</p><p>Regulus frowned. "You're a kid—"</p><p>"That doesn't matter to them," he spat bitterly. "They didn't care I was fifteen when they used me to get you to them. I… this is wrong." His eyes lingered on the cup, then back at Regulus, steely. "I can help. I <em>want</em> to help."</p><p>Regulus stared at Rabastan for a long moment. He then sighed, something grim and sad on his face that made him look much older than he was. "Come on, then."</p><p>Regulus and Rabastan joined Hermione, James, and Barty by the couch, looking over the post-its and stuck parchments on their information board. With a flick of Barty's wand, a glowing 'X appeared on the post-it with <em>cup</em> written on it in Petunia's neat cursive. It joined the ring, the locket, and the diadem.</p><p>"What's left?" asked James curiously.</p><p>"Just the diary," answered Barty. "And then…"</p><p>"Voldemort himself," finished Hermione.</p><p><em>Almost done,</em> thought Hermione, and for the first time in a long time, she felt something like hope.</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC…</p>

  <strong>March 1980</strong>
</p><p>"It's just not possible."</p><p>Hermione ignored Barty's grumble, thick around the raisins he was shoving in his mouth, moving them around as he spoke. Petunia's nose wrinkled, but she then hid the expression behind the mug of decaf tea Hermione had prepared for her and Sean when they arrived at the Haberdashery after her recent sonogram.</p><p>"Don't be such a pessimist—" began Sean, chidingly, but Barty shook his head.</p><p>"It's not possible," he repeated, a frown on his face as he obnoxiously chewed. "We can't get the diary, not when it's at Malfoy Manor. And there's no way that it'll be removed."</p><p>"What about oh, what's his name? The little, scrawny teenager Regulus mentioned with the Russian name?" asked Petunia.</p><p>"Rabastan?" asked Hermione incredulously, sharing a look with Barty that indicated her horror. "I won't trust Rabastan to go to Malfoy Manor and steal a horcrux!"</p><p>"But he's the only one who can still visit it," argued Petunia. "Regulus can't, not now that his father has lobbied the police chief for those funds—"</p><p>"Head Auror," muttered Barty. "My father is the <em>head Auror</em>—"</p><p>"He's just sixteen, Tuney!" Hermione reeled back. "He's still in school, for one; and two, I won't ask him to go into the viper's nest, and potentially end up the way we did—"</p><p>"You escaped—"</p><p>"<em>Barely</em>—"</p><p>Sean stood. "Whoa, whoa, that's enough. We're clearly not going to solve this today." He warily looked between the two sisters, glowering at one another. He gently touched Petunia's arm, drawing her attention. "It's getting late, Pet. Let's head home…"</p><p>"Fine," sniffed Petunia, tossing a last look at Hermione, who rolled her eyes.</p><p>"We'll ask Rabastan to meet us over the Easter hols," suggested Hermione, running a hand through her hair and grimacing as her fingers got caught. "Is that good enough, Tuney? We can have a planning session in a few weeks. It's not like the horcrux is going anywhere…"</p><p>"Fine," repeated Petunia. She glanced at Barty when she gave a terse, "Goodbye."</p><p>Barty lazily waved a hand and then tossed another raisin in his mouth as Sean hurried Petunia down the stairs. Hermione sagged the second the heavy second door to the Haberdashery shut, falling onto the couch, where her stomach protruded. She rested a hand on the tiny bump.</p><p>"We're almost there," said Barty quietly, eyes intent upon her.</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"It's almost over," he continued. He frowned. "What comes then?"</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "I'm not sure – it'll be different than what happened after in my original time, I'm sure."</p><p>"Did things get better?" asked Barty.</p><p>Hermione thought about the divide between purebloods and muggleborn in her time; about the attack in the Ministry; about Kingsley as Minister for Magic, Harry as Head Auror; about the people who died who should have lived.</p><p>"In some ways, it did," she finally said. "But in others… human nature doesn't change."</p><p>The two sat quietly in the aftermath of that, both introspective.</p><p>The quiet was broken by loud thumps racing up the stairs to the Haberdashery, causing both Hermione and Barty to look at each other in confusion and worry. Barty grabbed his wand, eyes blazing as he held it aloft and stood protectively in front of Hermione, who rose from the couch with her own wand in hand.</p><p>The door burst open, Regulus flying into the room, eyes wide. "Help!"</p><p>Both Hermione and Barty snapped their wands at the figures following behind him, spells on their tongues when Hermione realized what she was seeing: Lucius Malfoy carrying his wife, limp, in his arms. His white-blond hair was dishevelled and out of his usual tie, hanging loose around his shoulders. There was a gaunt, hollowness to him and his face that Hermione recognized from the Battle of Hogwarts.</p><p>"Help!" repeated Regulus, turning back to Narcissa. "She's hurt!"</p><p>"Then go to St. Mungo's," snapped Barty, not lowering his wand.</p><p>"I <em>can't</em>," snarled Lucius, clutching his wife tighter. "<em>He</em> will know!"</p><p>"Hermione, <em>please</em>," begged Regulus. He took a few steps closer to her, and Hermione glanced from Narcissa's still form in her husband's arms and the red on his hands and around her middle, to Regulus. "She's my family. She's a <em>Black</em>."</p><p><em>For what she did for Harry,</em> thought Hermione, vaguely, as she pushed the sleeves of her shirt up. "To the bedroom."</p><p>Hermione led the way, Malfoy behind her along with Regulus and Barty, who eyed the taller and older wizard with a scowl on his face.</p><p>"Put her down on the bed," instructed Hermione, stepping back far enough in the tiny room for him. He carefully did so, a hand coming to gently brush some of Narcissa's dark hair from her forehead.</p><p>"You'll help?" he asked quietly.</p><p>"I'll do my best," she responded, turning to Regulus and Barty. "Out. You can't be here."</p><p>"What!" protested Barty, his voice rising shrilly. "I'll not leave you with him – he's a Death Eater—"</p><p>"You can't be in here for this," said Hermione coolly, shoving at Barty who took Regulus, behind him, with him as they were manhandled out of the room. "I think I'll be safe."</p><p>Barty went to protest some more, but Hermione slammed the door in his face, turning back to Narcissa and Lucius.</p><p>"What magic was cast on her?" asked Hermione as she knelt beside the camper bed, Lucius hovering at the foot. She had her wand out and cast a diagnostic, something she was very familiar with during her years with Harry.</p><p>"<em>Cruiciatus</em>," he replied immediately, voice low. "Cutting hexes, a blood boiler. Others but I didn't – didn't catch them."</p><p>Hermione winced. "Was it him? The Dark Lord?"</p><p>He nodded, once, sharply.</p><p>As Hermione glanced at Narcissa's very obvious baby bump, she asked, "Was it deliberate? With her being pregnant?"</p><p>Again, Lucius nodded, a tiny noise escaping him. "Will she… will <em>they</em>… survive?"</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips, her eyes running over Narcissa's still form, the paleness to her already grey-tinged face and bloodless lips. "I'll do my best," she repeated and then got to work.</p><p>She did what she could with spells, with dittany, with her own magic, drawing whatever she could out that was considered foul and dark on Narcissa's body. Her own magic had risen in response to the attack, protecting her unborn child – like Harry's own experiences – but she suffered in response, comatose with shallow breaths.</p><p>It took hours, but eventually, Hermione opened the door to the tiny bedroom, spotting Barty and Regulus both waiting. Barty stood, arms crossed; Regulus was on the floor, elbows perched on his knees with his hands in his hair. Both looked at Hermione.</p><p>"She'll survive," she said, worn. She was exhausted. "But I don't think she'll be able to have any more children."</p><p>She stepped out of the room, giving the two wizards a glimpse at Lucius sitting next to Narcissa's hip, gently running his fingers through her hair with a soft, but tortured, expression on his face.</p><p>The three went to the living space, Barty stoking the fire that dimmed while Hermione was with Narcissa and Lucius. Regulus busied his hands with the kettle, tapping it to warm it again as the water boiled.</p><p>After some time, when they were all ranged on the couches and Regulus in his favourite armchair, Lucius appeared.</p><p>His eyes skipped over Barty and Regulus, landing on Hermione. He gave a shallow bow. "Mrs. Potter. I am indebted to you for saving the life of my wife and heir – and I acknowledge that."</p><p>A tingle of magic ran up Hermione's spine. It wasn't a life debt, but it was significant enough that he would need to do something she asked – and Hermione knew exactly what she wanted. An opportunity like this would not happen again.</p><p>Hermione nodded back. "You're welcome." She paused. "Why did the Dark Lord attack Narcissa, of all people?"</p><p>Lucius visibly struggled to hide his sneer but eventually answered. "Since – the summer—" <em>how cute,</em> thought Hermione,<em> to hide "kidnapping and torture" under such a guise</em> "—the Dark Lord has been wroth. You named names and several of his were rounded by the Aurors and sent to Azkaban. He lost support that evening."</p><p>"So sorry," drawled Barty, rolling his eyes.</p><p>Lucius shot him a glare. "Things may have worked out well for <em>you</em>, but for those of us who remained, it's hasn't been pleasant!"</p><p>"You made your bed," sneered Barty hotly. "Suck it up."</p><p>"Barty," scolded Regulus, stress lines still on his face. "Let the wizard speak."</p><p>"Malfoy Manor was raided several times after that," the older man continued with an imperious nose tilt.</p><p>"And yet, you're not in Azkaban," pointed out Barty. Hermione was perfectly happy letting him play 'bad Auror.' "So, you must have done something right."</p><p>Lucius sneered. "My father made some donations—"</p><p>Hermione sighed.</p><p>"—and then skipped the bloody country!" the wizard finished, aggravated. "As did my mother, leaving me and 'Cissa behind!"</p><p><em>Behind to feel Voldemort's displeasure,</em> thought Hermione, sympathy tinging in her chest for the witch.</p><p>"He's been a menace since then," the wizard finished with a sigh. "Taking his anger out on us for failing him – his other Death Eaters – and yet he lived in my home! Under my roof! And dared to raise his wand against his host!"</p><p>"So, he's not there anymore?" asked Regulus, catching that point.</p><p>Lucius shook his head. "He left late last evening, to parts unknown. He took some others with him, though – Bellatrix, for one. She's never far from his side."</p><p>"Will he be returning?" asked Hermione, leaning forward on the couch.</p><p>"No. I failed him enough times, he said."</p><p>Barty scoffed and rose from his end of the couch to pace behind it, bleeding off his energy even though he scowled and muttered under his breath uncomplimentary things about the blond wizard in their space.</p><p>Hermione glanced at their information board, disguised under a notice-me-not. Lucius would know there was something there they didn't want him to see, but either Barty or Regulus (most likely Barty) would have disguised their mission from him after his frantic run through the Haberdashery. On that information board was the last piece they needed: the diary. And if Voldemort was gone from Malfoy Manor – if he had left the diary with Lucius –</p><p>
  <em>If, if, if.</em>
</p><p>"In return for my help," began Hermione, turning back from the wall, "I want something you have."</p><p>"Granted," drawled Lucius, adopting a bored tone despite the twitch his fingers made. "A book? Some old artworks? Jewelry?"</p><p>"No." Hermione leaned forward further, looking hard at him. "In your drawing room, under the floor in the hidden space—" he violently twitched, eyes growing wide in shock that she knew of the space "—there is a collection of dark artifacts. One is what I seek, should you still have it."</p><p>Lucius's Adam's apple bobbed in his throat. "What is it?"</p><p>"An old diary. Unassuming. Black cover. Thin. Inside it should say, 'property of Tom M. Riddle'."</p><p>"I…" Lucius trailed off. "I shall check."</p><p>"You have an hour," interrupted Regulus, finally speaking up. "To retrieve it and bring it here. Then the debt is paid."</p><p>"What is it to you?" he asked, eyes narrowed between Hermione and Regulus.</p><p>"Nothing you need to concern yourself with if you want to debt considered paid," replied Hermione carefully. "Do we have a deal?"</p><p>"We do." He paused, glancing down the hall. "Narcissa will be safe?"</p><p>"We will guard her with our lives," replied Regulus, as her family member.</p><p>Lucius nodded. Then, he was gone.</p><p>"How long do we wait?" asked Barty, the second they heard his Apparation crack.</p><p>"An hour and not a minute longer," replied Hermione, settling back against the couch. "So, sit back and wait, boys."</p><p>Barty nodded but paced, hands behind his back. Regulus stared into the fireplace, the light casting long and hooded shadows across his face, and Hermione kept her eyes close, lightly dozing.</p><p>Forty-three minutes later, Lucius was back, just shy of when Barty was going to say "fuck it," and storm out of the Haberdashery. He approached Hermione carefully, hesitantly when he passed over the book. "It feels dark," he said, glancing at her stomach. "Are you sure you want this?"</p><p>"I'll take it!" Barty reached and snatched the horcrux, quickly tossing it at the wet bar furthest from them at the back of the room. "That's all, Malfoy."</p><p>He was suspicious, eyes flitting between the three, until Hermione said, "Narcissa is well enough to take home, but she should be on bed rest until your heir is born. It shouldn't be much longer now, anyway."</p><p>Regulus sent her a sharp glare at that.</p><p>"Very well." He had exchanged his wand holster for his wand cane, gripping the head tightly. "I shall retrieve my wife and leave."</p><p>"You do that," said Barty, dismissively.</p><p>Lucius's face darkened in anger, but he refrained from saying anything else. Narcissa was not conscious, but <em>mobilicorpus</em> had her gently moved from the bed to Lucius's arms, and not ten minutes later, they were both gone.</p><p>The air seemed less tense in the haberdashery once they were gone and Barty let out a huge sigh of relief. The three looked at each other and then rushed to the bar, staring at the horcrux where it leeched the light from the space around it.</p><p>"Who wants the honours?" asked Hermione.</p><p>"Me," replied Regulus darkly. "For my cousin."</p><p>Barty and Hermione stepped back, Hermione several more paces until she was as far as she could be from it. The last of the basilisk venom dripped from the crystal vial, hissing and hitting the diary.</p><p>As the first, there was no wail of terror, or fuzzy wraith rising from the pages; but the book flipped open and leafed through its yellowed pages in an unseen, vicious wind that whipped at Hermione's hair and ruffled the sticky notes and parchments on their information board. The wind reached a crescendo and then disappeared, leaving silence behind and an innocent-looking book, smoking from the holes where the venom sizzled through.</p><p>Barty let out a breath of relief. "Is… Is it gone?"</p><p>"It's gone," confirmed Regulus. He put the vial down on the bar, hand trembling.</p><p>Hermione moved first to the information board. There was a parchment stuck to the wall with 'diary' written on it in Petunia's handwriting, under "horcruxes." She undid the sticking charm with a tap of her finger, magic making its way from her to the paper windlessly. Then she did the same in reverse, placing the parchment under another heading: "destroyed horcruxes."</p><p>Barty and Regulus came to stand on either side of her, staring in vague disbelief at the empty horcrux category and the full 'destroyed' one instead on the other side of their wall.</p><p>"Did we…" Barty trailed off.</p><p>"Yeah," breathed Regulus.</p><p>"Does this mean…" Barty continued, voice thick.</p><p>"Uh-huh," answered Regulus, eyes wet. He blinked rapidly.</p><p>"He's mortal," finished Hermione, a note of triumph in her voice.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>May 1980</strong>
</p><p>As the months tripped along and into spring, James oscillated between putting his foot down on her taking magical means of transport to get places and passive-aggressively leaving her newly purchased books and medical pamphlets about the dangers of the Floo on her pregnant body, the body horrors of Apparating while pregnant and splinching oneself, and the statistical mishaps of pregnant witches on the Knight Bus.</p><p>Hermione received the message, loud and clear, and resigned herself to not seeing her parents until after the baby was born. It did mean that her social circle was narrowed to her magical friends that <em>could</em> still travel by wizarding means, and Petunia and Sean who had access to the Tube, but with Petunia's own ever-expanding waist, those visits were few and far in between.</p><p>But the Crouch family home was only a few streets over, within walking distance from the townhouse Barty had given her, and Grimmauld Place was – by muggle transport – a twenty-minute Tube ride away if Hermione ever had the desire to visit that hellhole again. As it was, she had <em>no</em> desire to visit Grimmauld Place while Walburga was alive; clearly, Sirius felt the same and showed up unannounced one afternoon, with Remus and Peter tagging along behind. And despite James's fretting, Hermione's husband disappeared into their basement with several loud bangs and crashes and raucous laughter emerging an hour or so later.</p><p>Hermione, who had been trying to read, huffed loudly. With a tersely written note that charmed to fly down the stairs, Hermione heaved herself up and grumbled as she waddled at seven months pregnant, out the front door and down the tree-lined streets until she arrived at the Crouch family home.</p><p>Winky opened the door, bulbous eyes widening further when she saw Hermione on the inner stoop. "Missy Potter!" she ushered the witch inside, eyes lingering on her belly. "Come in!"</p><p>"Thank you Winky," replied Hermione, smiling down at the house elf. "Is Barty in?"</p><p>"Young Master is, Missy." The elf's head bobbed frantically. "I's take you to him and Mister Regulus."</p><p>Hermione brightened. "Oh, Reg is here, too? Wonderful."</p><p>Hermione thought she would be led to Barty's room, but instead, she was directed to a sitting room, the same one she met Iris Crouch in years ago. Barty was sitting with Regulus on a couch (although stuffing his face with the pastries Winky made while Regulus had a long-suffering look on his face with his pinky finger extended from the teacup, he had in one hand and his saucer in the other), his mother and father also in the room, Mr. Crouch looking grumpy and wan. Iris was in the middle of pouring tea to the other guests in the room: a swarthy looking middle-aged man in a linen suit and a few dangerous looking burns and scars; and two blonde women that shared features with Iris that Hermione both knew from Hogwarts, one holding a newborn cradled in her arms as she cooed over the child, and one who had the tiniest of bumps, emphasized only by the rich and fashionable cut of her robes.</p><p>"Mrs. Potter!" Iris beamed as Winky announced her. "Oh, my dear, look at you!"</p><p>Iris stood, and Barty and Regulus jumped to their feet, Barty's father grunting and doing so as well, a bit slower. Iris, however, rushed to her side, exclaiming, "Not much longer now, dear, isn't that, right?"</p><p>"Late July," agreed Hermione with a mild wince as the baby kicked.</p><p>"Oh, please, sit, Mrs. Potter," fussed Iris.</p><p>"Mrs. Crouch, you <em>know</em> you can call me by my name," grinned Hermione as Barty scrambled away from his spot on the couch to help Hermione sit. She sighed as she sunk into the cushions. He then moved to a nearby armchair, between the couch and the swarthy-looking wizard.</p><p>"It seems everyone is having babies," grinned the witch with the sharper cheekbones and red lipstick, rocking her newborn absently. "But I must say, I wasn't expecting Hermione Evans to be one of them!"</p><p>Hermione good-naturedly rolled her eyes. "I live to defy expectations, Hyacinth."</p><p>"Oh, that's right," began Iris as she poured Hermione a cup of tea, "You and Barty-bear would've been in Ravenclaw that same time as my sister."</p><p>Barty grimaced at the nickname and hid it behind a loud slurp of his tea while Regulus shoved – elegantly – a cucumber finger sandwich into his mouth to stop from laughing, a reversal of how they were when she arrived.</p><p>Hermione nodded. "Hyacinth was the fifth-year Prefect when we entered." Her eyes moved to the other Fawley sister. "And Clemensia was in Slytherin, although we didn't interact that much, being two years above us."</p><p>Clemensia inclined her head. "I knew who you were, of course. Brilliant Ravenclaw, Regulus Black's friend…" she sighed with exaggerated humour. "Your Arithmancy study guides were a hit in the Slytherin dorms come exams."</p><p>"I'd never say no to some extra sickles at the time," agreed Hermione with a grin.</p><p>"They certainly helped," replied Clemensia. "Regulus suggested it to Albert Runcorn, and he told the rest of us. It was no wonder Professor Pythas had you tutoring James Potter."</p><p>"Iris said you are due in July?" interrupted Hyacinth, leaning forward eagerly, her blue eyes wide. "We should schedule a playdate! I wish for Daphne to have a large social circle before she begins Hogwarts."</p><p>Hermione blinked, glancing at the baby in Hyacinth's arms only to realize, shock overcoming her, that the newborn in her arms was <em>Daphne Greengrass</em>.</p><p>Hyacinth was speaking over any answer Hermione could have given. "—already spoken to Narcissa, her labour was so stressful in March, the poor thing, but House Malfoy has an heir in young Draco, so I suppose it all worked out." She turned to her sister. "Are you still angling for an in there, Clemmie?" there was something wicked on Hyacinth's face when she taunted, "Moving that crush of yours from Lucius to your daughter's goals of becoming the next lady of House Malfoy?"</p><p>The swarthy man laughed loudly. "Brother, your sisters-in-law are <em>delightful</em>."</p><p>At Hermione's confused glance, the man gave a tiny bow. "Wallace Crouch, ICW Hit Wizard, at your service, Mrs. Potter."</p><p><em>Crouch?</em> Hermione's confused eyes glanced at Barty quickly, who tilted his head in his father's direction. <em>He's family. Someone not heard of in my original time.</em></p><p>"Pleasure," replied Hermione, a bit stiffly, when her eyes rested back on the younger Crouch.</p><p>"My nephew and Mr. Black had mentioned your talents, and the Ladies Greengrass and Parkinson agreed," the man continued with an easy, charming grin from behind his moustache that had his eyes crinkling at the corners.</p><p>Hermione's face froze and she desperately tried to stop from looking at Clemensia, or her pregnant belly, where Pansy currently resided. Clearly, Hermione's Hogwarts tormentor didn't inherit her mother's blonde hair or pale skin, taking more of her father's looks.</p><p>Wallace Crouch continued genially, "What is it that you do, Mrs. Potter? With your abilities, I'd imagine an entire world of career possibilities is available for you. Barty was tight-lipped."</p><p>"Research, primarily," answered Hermione truthfully, if not vaguely. "I'm not attached to any particular career at this moment, preferring to be a freelance agent so that my talents can be used where my interests lie."</p><p>"Mrs. Potter has been instrumental in closing some high-profile cases," Mr. Crouch said suddenly, drawing all attention to him.</p><p>Hermione blinked in surprise as everyone turned to Crouch.</p><p>"There had been an incident involving her, my son, and Mr. Black at the end of their Hogwarts career," he explained for Wallace's benefit, while Iris frowned at the conversation topic and Hyacinth grimaced. "The information they provided aided the Auror Department."</p><p>Wallace's eyebrows shot up, and he surveyed Hermione anew.</p><p>"That so?" he murmured before his eyes skipped to Barty. "Do you work with Mrs. Potter, Barty?"</p><p>Her friend nodded, a tight grip on his teacup. "I've been shadowing father at the Ministry lately. He allows me to review old, cold Auror cases."</p><p>"I'm pleased to see my son interested in something instead of aimlessly wasting his time away," barked Mr. Crouch with a tiny harrumph at the end of his sentence. "Between the three of them, they've been a great help. Merlin knows I am able to do my job because of them. Damn Bagnold!"</p><p>Iris sighed. "Darling, let's not discuss politics—"</p><p>"Oh, 'Rissie, if we don't speak of politics, what is there to speak of?" drawled Clemensia in a horribly familiar, grating way that made Hermione repress a shudder. "The weather? <em>Muggles</em>? How droll."</p><p>"Muggles are being affected now," muttered Crouch Senior, a feverish look in his eyes. "The liaison to the Muggle Prime Minister's office has been working overtime, trying to smooth relations. Members of their government are going missing – there's been too many unexplained 'gas leaks' across the country, and the permanent cold spell off the coast of Aberdeen means that the Dementors are leaving Azkaban unbidden!"</p><p>Barty's father was building himself into a rant, spitting his words out.</p><p>"Bagnold's not doing a bloody thing! And the Wizengamot refuses to give special permissions to take down these pureblood terrorists—"</p><p>"Are they, though?" interrupted Clemensia with an eye roll. "Are we really saying that these people are purebloods?"</p><p>Crouch's glare at his sister-in-law was murderous. "Given who they attack, I can only strongly suspect."</p><p>Clemensia sniffed. "<em>Other</em> purebloods have been attacked, Bartemius. Like your son and Mr. Black here. Perhaps it is the work of unhappy halfbloods, or even disgruntled mud—pardon me, muggleborns."</p><p>Hermione barely held back rolling her eyes. "Well, given that I happily identified a number of Slytherin alumni when I was kidnapped, Clemensia, I'll have to disagree with them being muggleborns."</p><p>Barty snickered, not even trying to hide it.</p><p>"If these terrorists – these, <em>Death Eaters</em>," began Regulus, in a carefully modulated but heavily lofty pureblood voice, "are attacking indiscriminately, then they need to be stopped."</p><p>"Just so," agreed Crouch with a sharp nod. "I've been asking Bagnold to allow for my Aurors to use the Unforgivables when out—"</p><p>"Surely not!" gasped Hyacinth, clutching Daphne closer to her breasts. "Unforgivables, Bartemius? You could potentially end entire lines—"</p><p>"Which is what they're already doing," replied Crouch Senior harshly. "Or have you not read the papers recently, Hyacinth? The Bones, the McKinnons – pureblood families, both. The Bones are even Sacred Twenty-Eight, if you want to buy into that rubbish."</p><p>Hyacinth fell silent.</p><p>"No, the only way to end this is to end them, from root to stem," spat Crouch. "And if I must go elsewhere for the help I need to ensure this country remains free from tyranny, then so be it."</p><p><em>Well,</em> thought Hermione, carefully hiding her shock behind a mask of indifference as Clemensia began to argue with her brother-in-law. <em>I didn't quite see it coming from that angle.</em> She looked at Barty and Regulus, both who gave either a tiny shrug (Barty), or a slight narrowing of their eyes (Regulus) to indicate that this was news to them as well.</p><p>But it was Wallace Crouch who caught Hermione's attention, as the thirty-something year old wizard leaned back in his seat, his dark, clever eyes (so like Barty's, and his father's), watched and listened as Crouch and Clemensia really got into it, Iris trying to tempt her sister back into a different conversation with Hyacinth's help – and failing.</p><p>The ICW was never involved with Voldemort in either of the wars he fought on British soil in Hermione's past life. Voldemort had been purely a British problem, and the ICW, for all its body attempted to be globally judicial, did nothing except to censure Dumbledore in 1995 for announcing the Dark Lord's return and dismiss him from his post for fearmongering. Even when Voldemort took over the Ministry in his successful coup, the ICW never intervened. They had only done so regarding a Dark Lord with Grindelwald when he crossed international borders.</p><p>So, why was Wallace Crouch in Britain? Why was he so interested?</p><p>Hermione resolved to ask Barty when they had some privacy; then made a note to herself to speak to Dorea and Charlus about the ICW and its reach when she saw her in-laws next. Keeping an eye on the wizard was undeniable.</p><p>So, Hermione took a sip of her tepid tea and kept her ears open, and eyes on Barty's uncle.</p><hr /><p>James greeted Sirius joyfully and with a tight hug, clutching at his best friend's shoulders. Startled, Sirius laughed and asked, "Alright, Prongs, what's that for?" even as he hugged him back.</p><p><em>For everything that has yet to happen,</em> thought James, finally drawing back. It was the first time he had seen Sirius since Hermione's reveal about his fate in the future. The Blacks had not fared well in the two wars, with only Andromeda and Narcissa surviving out of the entire clan, and with only Harry, Draco, and Teddy remaining with Black blood. But more than that – Sirius would go through hell for him, and James would not take that future knowledge lightly.</p><p>"Just… it's been too long, Pads," he replied instead, leading him to the kitchen while Hermione remained in the sitting room, reading and relaxing.</p><p>"Yeah," Sirius agreed with a tired sigh. "Still can't believe they split us up with Auror training! At least we won't be a cadet much longer – though the fast-tracking is literal <em>murder</em>. I don't think I've slept more than three hours a night."</p><p>James grimaced. "And I'm certain Crouch told Moody and Scrimgeour to go easy on us because my wife is best friends with his son. You get that by association with me."</p><p>"Nah, mate," snorted Sirius, "That's not happening. <em>You</em> get the preferential treatment, not me!"</p><p>They were still bickering about it when Remus and Peter both apparated in, a combined, loud <em>pop</em> that they heard at the back of the townhouse. Sirius turned to greet them as they walked into the kitchen, loudly enthusing their hello's and how are you's but James took a moment, keeping his back to them.</p><p>He swallowed thickly, eyes shut, and hands clenched even as his heart cried out <em>Pete, how could you?</em></p><p>"<em>Not yet,"</em> whispered Hermione's voice across his mind, and James calmed. Peter had not spied or betrayed (him) the Order until a year before the other James's death. He still had a few months unless Peter was already being courted – or <em>ex</em>torted.</p><p>When he turned around, it was with a plastered smile on his face, his eyes a bit too wide as he enthusiastically cried, "Moony! Wormtail!"</p><p>It was a far cry from the greeting he gave Sirius, who glanced at him, brows furrowed the tiniest. But James ignored Sirius's look and said, loudly, "Let's go to the basement, lads – Hermione's in the sitting room and I don't want to disturb her."</p><p>"How's she doing?" asked Remus, concern on his face.</p><p>"Moody," admitted James with a goofy grin on his face that he always got when speaking of her or their child – their potential Harry. "Feet swollen, backaches, has heartburn but looking forward to when we see our kid. She keeps distracted with her research."</p><p>Remus perked up. "What's she looking at now?"</p><p>James gave a brief rundown on one of Hermione's side projects, completely unrelated to Voldemort, his horcruxes, or anything to do with the war effort, as he led his friends down the hall and to the basement door. He did not stop, nor did he allow Remus (who was already muttering follow-up questions to ask Hermione) to head to the sitting room, herding them and shuffling them as one large body.</p><p>Sirius trailed, stopping James when Peter and Remus went down the stairs first. "Is everything fine?"</p><p>"Yeah, why wouldn't it be?" replied James in confusion even as he hid a wince.</p><p>"You're acting strange."</p><p>James shook his head. "It's nothing – just some stuff Hermione told me." At Sirius's eyebrow raise, he clarified: "About the future, with our kid. Parental planning, really."</p><p><em>Not a truth,</em> thought James, <em>but not a lie, either.</em></p><p>Sirius still seemed skeptical but let the matter drop.</p><p>James distracted himself with his friends and reliving their pranks while coming up with new ones to use on Death Eaters – not like they would, but the idea was funny – and then actively trying to create those pranks. It took his mind off Hermione's alternate future, of where he, Remus, Sirius, and Peter would be in just over a years' time if things remained the same. It also was bittersweet, a hint of nostalgia tinged with frustration and annoyance that they could not go back to being Hogwarts students with fewer cares or worries.</p><p>Hours later, when they had worn themselves out laughing and blowing things up, Fawkes burst into the Potter house basement in a flash of heat and white light, depositing a sealed parchment with a familiar phoenix-symbol wax seal on the back.</p><p>Sirius put down the muggle beer Hermione kept in the fridge just for him with a loud sigh, looking mournfully at the nearly full can. "Well, it was good while it lasted."</p><p>James's shoulders slumped and he summoned a self-inking quill and parchment to leave Hermione a note for when she returned home, not even bothering to hide the information that he was attending an Order meeting – not anymore, not after everything that they shared.</p><p>After the wizards had a finger placed on the Order summons, with only a single word written on the inside to activate the portkey, Remus clearly said, "Snickerdoodles," and then they were whisked across space in a swirl of colours and shapes until they were falling from the sky toward a cottage surrounded by fields.</p><p>James landed with bent knees, staying upright, as did Sirius. Remus, who never took to portkeys well, bent at the waist and dry-heaved, his face green; Peter sprawled on his butt, groaning as he wriggled away from a large rock.</p><p>There was a cheery light filtering through the small windows of the cottage, and some noise as they approached. Sirius stepped through first, greeting Fabian and Gideon who were nearest to the door, wands out.</p><p>"Potter." Fabian's eyes fell on James as he entered the building, shivering as he felt strong, old wards wash over him. "Dumbledore's asking to see you before we begin."</p><p>Sirius glanced back at his best friend, a frown of confusion on his handsome face. "What's he want?"</p><p>Fabian made a face. "I don't question our <em>leader</em>, Black, do I?"</p><p>James couldn't quite make out what kind of face Fabian made, twisted as it was and Gideon turned quickly to mutter something at his brother that made Remus glance at them speculatively when he and Peter pressed further into the cottage, toward the back where the kitchen was. Sirius lingered.</p><p>"It'll be fine, Padfoot," whispered James, warmth suffusing him as his friend hovered. "Maybe even a mission!"</p><p>Sirius barked a laugh. "On your bloody own? Doubt it, mate."</p><p>James shook his head good-naturedly and turned toward the closed nearest closed door. He knocked once on it, and waited for Dumbledore's "enter," before he turned the knob.</p><p>Inside was a smallish bedroom, yet the bed was pushed against the wall and was more of a cot than an actual bed. There was a desk and a large, squishy chair. Dumbledore was in the chair – a garish yellow with orange stripes – and the grizzled Caradoc Dearborn, the burns from his torture while Voldemort's prisoner peaked out from under the collar of his robes. He was leaning against the desk, arms crossed with a frown on his face.</p><p>"Ah, James, come in," greeted Dumbledore warmly.</p><p>"Sir…" James trailed off in his own greeting, hesitantly stepping into the room. This was his first time seeing the Headmaster since he and Hermione had spoken – and suddenly, the thoughts of Hermione's past, the future she came from, and thoughts of the adventures she and Harry experienced, made James far more cautious than he thought he ought to be.</p><p>Dumbledore peered at James from behind his half-moon glasses, a genial smile on his face under his beard. It slowly slipped into something serious. "James, there is something Caradoc and I wish to bring to your attention."</p><p>Dearborn snorted. "You wanted to wait until we had more proof, Albus."</p><p>Dumbledore's lips thinned under bristles of white. "Yes, well…" He cleared his throat and turned to James. "What do you know of prophecies, James?"</p><p>"Prophecies?" James blinked. He hadn't taken divination at Hogwarts, so he drew upon what Hermione had ranted about when he finally got around to asking about the prophecy surrounding Harry's birth, and the ones that followed. "They're, uh, given by seers. Vague, usually, and that means people who hear them shape them to what they want them to be. They're, uh, unreliable."</p><p>Dumbledore beamed at him while Dearborn snorted and scowled. "Very good, James! Yes, prophecies are… well, once someone chases after them, they tend to become true if only because of self-determination."</p><p>"Prophecies are <em>magical</em>, and we should heed them," muttered Dearborn.</p><p>Dumbledore sent Dearborn a look that James could not interpret. When his blue eyes returned to James, he gave a tiny, tight smile. "As you can see, James, Caradoc and I disagree with the nature of a prophecy Caradoc brought to my attention some years ago."</p><p>His heart was thundering, and there was a sinking feeling in his stomach that made his throat tighten. "What – what prophecy? Why am I here?"</p><p>"Do you know what Caradoc used to do at the Ministry, James?" asked Dumbledore.</p><p>Thrown off by the change in topic, James replied, "No…?"</p><p>"I was an Unspeakable," said Caradoc gruffly. "I worked in the Hall of Prophecies, mostly."</p><p>"Okay…"</p><p>"When a prophecy is given, the Hall automatically records it in one of the spheres," explained Caradoc, eyes focused on James, who felt small and caged in. His inner stag was snorting and responding aggressively to the challenge, but James desperately tried to keep a hold of his rising worry, fear, and anger from spilling over. "If an Unspeakable is in the right place at the right time when a sphere records a prophecy, they can overhear it."</p><p>Dread filled James. "You overheard a prophecy."</p><p>Dearborn nodded. "I did."</p><p>James's eyes cut toward Dumbledore, and the headmaster held out his hands, supine. "Caradoc brought it to my attention back in the early 1970s, James. At first, it made no sense and I put it out of my mind – despite living in a very magical world, I like to believe we are masters of our own fate—"</p><p>"Then what changed?" interrupted James, something hard on his face. "And why are you telling <em>me</em> this, of all people?"</p><p>Dearborn and Dumbledore shared a look, and then Dumbledore sighed. "Caradoc and I spent much time once he told me the prophecy trying to decipher it. Unfortunately," Dumbledore sent an unrepentant Dearborn a mild glare, "doing so is nigh impossible—"</p><p>"It's about your wife," interrupted Dearborn rudely, staring at James.</p><p>He stared back. "I beg your pardon?"</p><p>"She fits," Dearborn continued, uncrossing his arms, and pushing off from the desk. "I wasn't sure – we were looking for someone magically powerful before, and of course, the students would be a good place to look – but I <em>knew</em> after Malfoy Manor."</p><p>James's heart stopped, his hazel eyes darting toward Dumbledore. The headmaster leaned forward with his wand against his temple and withdrew a silverly white strand of memory, turning and depositing the memory with a flick into a pensieve – which James saw for the first time was hidden behind his chair and on the desk.</p><p>A spectral figure of Dearborn – at least a decade younger – appeared, floating above the silvery liquid. In a tinny, thin voice compared to his in person, the younger memory Dearborn intoned, "<em>An unspeakable evil shrouds the land. Yet by balancing the scales of existence, hope shall be restored when chains are broken, through magic never before seen. What was once yesterday is tomorrow and tomorrow is today… For when the clock rewinds, everything is connected…</em>"</p><p>James wanted to throw up. The prophecy was about Hermione alright – magic never before seen? When the clock rewinds? Although only a handful of people knew about her time travelling, or her transmutation skills, it made James wonder what Dearborn and Dumbledore knew.</p><p>Swallowing, he managed to say, "How does this relate to my wife? This could be about anyone, any when."</p><p>Dearborn shrugged. "Yeah, it could have. But at Malfoy Manor, I saw what she could. She <em>dug a tunnel</em> from a prison. She didn't have a wand and transfigured the landscape to our advantage during a fight. She went toe-to-toe with Voldemort. How could that not be 'magic never before seen'?"</p><p>"And I'm sure you're associating 'an unspeakable evil' as You-Know-Who, given that's what people call him," said James, bitterness leaking into his voice.</p><p>"It fits," shrugged Dearborn.</p><p>"The rest doesn't," argued James, a scowl on his face. He reached up and righted his frames even as he looked at Dumbledore to see what the headmaster thought. "You're picking and choosing what you want for it to work and stick on her shoulders!"</p><p>"I agree, James," sighed Dumbledore tiredly. "But I must have hope. I will not tell the others, but we are losing, badly. Voldemort grows stronger every day. His followers grow bolder, no longer just kidnapping people or placing them under the Imperius Curse. Murders are brazen, in daylight. Muggles have noticed the unrest, and the Prime Minister has been adamant in Bagnold finding a solution. We are barely keeping our cauldron full, and the Aurors are tired, as you well know."</p><p>"That still doesn't mean it's Hermione," replied James quietly. "Don't put this on her shoulders. We're about to have a <em>child</em> for Merlin's sake—"</p><p>"I know." Dumbledore rubbed at the bridge of his nose, looking tired. "I know, James. I did not wish to burden you with this—"</p><p>Dearborn interrupted. "Your wife can do things we've never seen with magic. She's held her own against him. She's part of a prophecy. We <em>need</em> her."</p><p>James nearly snarled at the man, his palm itching and desperately wanting his wand in his hand and a curse on his lips. "Do <em>not</em>, Dearborn! <em>Do not</em> speak about her that way!"</p><p>"James…"</p><p>But James shot a glare at Dumbledore. "Or you, sir. Hermione already turned down your offer to join the Order. Respect that. Leave her alone. If you need a prophesized saviour to win the war, then maybe you should reconsider how you're trying to win it."</p><p>With that parting shot, James turned on his heel and yanked open the door, slamming it behind him as he stepped through, breathing heavily through his nose. Sirius rested against the wall opposite, casually eyeing his nails with his legs crossed at the ankle. He startled upright when James slammed the door.</p><p>"Prongs…?"</p><p>Through gritted teeth, James muttered, "Not now, Padfoot."</p><p>Warily, Sirius looked back at the door but nodded, falling in step with James as they walked down the hall and entered the cheery kitchen, magically expanded and loud with noise as people caught up and gossiped before Dumbledore entered.</p><p>James sat stiffly in his chair with his arms crossed, brooding. From the corner of his eye, he fuzzily caught two redheads' glance at him, even as Sirius sat and tried to rouse his spirits into something less moody.</p><p>"Is everything alright?" whispered Remus, from Sirius's other side.</p><p>"It's fine—" but Sirius spoke over him.</p><p>"Something's bothering Prongs, but he's not talking about it."</p><p>Peter piped up, "Anything we can do to help?"</p><p>"Just drop it," snapped James, uncharacteristically, causing all three other Marauders to blink at him in shock and shared concerned looks. But Dumbledore appeared soon after, with Dearborn, and the Order crowd settled as he took his place at the head of the table, Dearborn on one side and Moody on the other.</p><p>"You-Know-Who has been doing a bit too well for my tastes," began Moody gruffly. "Either he's drunk some Felix Felicis, or we're leaking like a bloody sieve."</p><p>Uneasy murmurs ran through the room and people began to eye each other up, warily.</p><p>"We're not saying there's a spy in our ranks," began Dumbledore, a genial smile on his face.</p><p><em>It's exactly what he's saying,</em> thought James moodily.</p><p>"—but we do need to be vigilant about who we speak to about our movements," he finished, making sure to look at each member for a lingering moment as though he was speaking to that person directly. "If you speak of Order business at home, make sure it is not in front of your children, or your spouses."</p><p>At that, Dumbledore's eyes hit James, and James <em>seethed</em>, clenching his hands in his lap. Sirius saw and did a doubletake between his hands, him, and Dumbledore.</p><p>"We need to stop <em>reacting</em>," added Dearborn frankly, a sour twist to his mouth. The burned flesh at the side of his neck was a darker red than normal, indicating his annoyance and frustration, much of it lingering from the less-than-fruitful discussion with James earlier, he thought. Again, from the corner of his eye, he saw Fabian and Gideon share a look, and he wondered what that was about -- when had the two Prewett twins ever show concern for him?</p><p>"We, along with Crouch's Aurors, are often called to the scene after You-Know-Who's Death Eaters have long fled," continued Dearborn. "We need to be there <em>before</em> the Aurors show up—"</p><p>"Aren't we working with them?" a confused member piped up. There were some murmurs.</p><p>Moody shook his head. "We're considered a vigilante group. Crouch won't go after us—" Moody's eyes skipped at James and Sirius, briefly "—but we're not there to aid them."</p><p>"Then what <em>is</em> the point of us?" drawled Fabian, leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed.</p><p><em>Good question,</em> thought James, pursing his own lips in agreement as his eyes darted over at Dumbledore.</p><p>"Our goal has been, and always will be, to defeat Voldemort." The headmaster of Hogwarts laced his fingers together and rested them on the table. "While Head Auror Crouch has finally received an increase in funding from the Wizengamot, his push to allow his Aurors to use the Unforgiveables is still being blocked. Should that pass, well… the Aurors can focus on Voldemort's Death Eaters."</p><p>"Crouch is a stubborn bastard," muttered Dearborn. "He'll get his way sooner or later."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Headmaster," spoke up Remus, carefully with wide eyes. "Are you saying that you want <em>us</em> – people who are nowhere near You-Know-Who's skill and power – to fight him? Surely, that's what <em>you</em> are here for."</p><p>Dumbledore smiled at Remus. "I have faith that all of us working together will prevail."</p><p>James held in his scoff, mulishly glaring down at the table and missing Fabian and Gideon's looks, as well as ignoring Sirius's agitated form next to him practically vibrating with the need to know why he was upset.</p><p>There was some more discussion – about patrols, sending out the Prewetts and asking Lily to brew some potions – and then the meeting was dismissed. James was on his feet immediately, ready to stride toward the front door and past the anti-Apparation jinx around the property. He wanted to go home, to Hermione, to rant to her about Dumbledore.</p><p>But the man was quick and spry and, on his feet, too, blocking James in the hallway with a hand on his arm. "James. You mustn't tell your wife—"</p><p>"<em>Excuse me</em>!" He reeled back, eyes flashing at the man.</p><p>"—I only meant," the headmaster sighed, "That this is a burden for her. And one she likely would not appreciate. Let us keep it between us, as you surely do not believe in it and I believe, nor would she."</p><p>James scowled, yanking his arm back and out of the headmaster's grip.</p><p>"I hope this doesn't change things between us—" he tried to continue.</p><p>"I am still committed to ending this war," spat James, barely hearing himself over the furious thundering of his heart. "But I strongly suggest not calling me for some time, Headmaster, lest my wand's aim slip."</p><p>Dumbledore's own eyes cooled at the blatant threat. "Very well, Mr. Potter."</p><p>"Prongs?" called Sirius, coming up behind him in the tight and narrow hallway. "Headmaster Dumbledore."</p><p>"Boys," the headmaster greeted. There was a tight smile on his face, partially hidden by his beard and moustache. "Safe travels."</p><p>"Thank you, Headmaster," answered Remus for them even as Sirius ushered James quickly down the hall, a hand on his shoulder as he guided James.</p><p>"Oh, Remus," the headmaster called as they neared the door, stopping them. "Do you have a moment?"</p><p>Remus nervously glanced back at his friends, at James's stony visage and Sirius's concern. But it was Peter who nudged him with his shoulder, despite their height differences, and said, lowly, "Go on, Moony, see what he has to say. We'll catch up later."</p><p>Remus nodded.</p><p>James, distracted, muttered a vague goodbye and sped out of the doorway and down the path until he reached the gate. He needed to get home. Immediately.</p><p>"James—"</p><p>As he spun on his heel, James called, "Later, Pads—" and disapparated with a sharp, angry crack.</p><p>He reappeared in his townhouse foyer, eyes adjusting from the country darkness of the Order cottage he had been outside of to the warm interior casting a soft yellow glow against the dark wood panels.</p><p>"Hermione?" he shouted.</p><p>"Library!" came a distracted shout in reply.</p><p>James stormed forward, up the stairs and down the hall until he was in Hermione's office – the library as she called it, since it was overfilled with books. She stood over a desk, ignoring the chair, and was leafing through official documentation, based on the large emblem at the top of the pages.</p><p>"What's that?" he asked, stepping into the brightly lit room.</p><p>"ICW enlisting," she muttered, partially distracted. "For their Hit Wizard program. Trying to find a name on here but I'm off on dates and I'm not sure when they were born—"</p><p>"I'll do some digging on my end at the office tomorrow," offered James, reaching to touch her hand and pull her from the paper.</p><p>Her amber eyes glanced up at him and she stilled, a frown on her face. "What happened?"</p><p>James was solemn when he replied, "We need to talk."</p><p>Slowly, Hermione sank to the chair, her expression as serious as his as he began to explain the Order meeting.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>Late May</strong>
</p><p>To make things fair, the Evans sisters agreed to individual baby showers. Marlene had been planning Lily's before her death, and Petunia stepped in at the last minute to help finalize it but decided that since Marlene had made it mostly magical, she wouldn't attend.</p><p>For Hermione, who had gone, it had been a who's who of the Gryffindor graduating class in Lily's year, with some other notable additions. There was a palpable gap in the Gryffindor girls, with Marlene dead, an empty space between Phoebe Sinclair – who had married Damocles Belby's brother, Pericles, and muggleborn Mary MacDonald, looking wane and tired, as well as flighty, jumping at every noise.</p><p>Alice Longbottom was there, massively pregnant herself and muttering death threats toward an absent Sirius Black; Miriam Lowe, also pregnant and married to Elias Goldstein – <em>Great Scott, that's Anthony in there,</em> thought Hermione, wide-eyed when she greeted the Hufflepuff alum – dropped by the baby shower, as did Evelyn Perks (now, Diggory), Francis Jones (now, Higgs), and some of Lily's favourite professors from Hogwarts, like McGonagall, or people from the Order, like Hestia (who came with her niece, Francis), Dorcas Meadowes, and Emmaline Vance.</p><p>Petunia had cried off attending, as had a reluctant Rose Evans when she realized that most of the people at Lily's baby shower were going to be magical, citing that she would attend Petunia and Hermione's instead with Lily's gift. Overall, Hermione found the afternoon atmosphere solemn and mildly tense, as many of those attending was either directly involved with the war (on one side or the other), or very aware of what the others were up to.</p><p>Petunia's baby shower, jointly hosted by Hermione and their mother back in Cokeworth, went much better with many of Petunia's schoolmates that knew of Hermione and colly disdained Lily, the awkward sister of the group for a change. But Petunia had fun with the games Rose had planned and Hermione's decorations and food were topnotch, and Petunia ended the day with several necessary items.</p><p>Hermione's baby shower was… eclectic.</p><p>Her friend circle was, at worst, Barty and Regulus – two men who were either only children or the youngest of the family and therefore had never been around babies. Furthermore, they were both purebloods raised by house elves. They had no idea what babies needed.</p><p>When the circle expanded, Hermione realized her only other friend was Dirk, another male. <em>I really need more female friends,</em> thought Hermione wryly, but it accurately reflected her life as Hermione Granger, so she gave a mental shrug and suggested that they extend the baby shower to include James and his friends to bring together everyone who would be involved in their lives.</p><p>So, while Petunia, Sean, as well as Hermione's parents Rose and Leonard, were the only muggles attending – having decided to spare their uncle Duncan and grandparents from the chaos that was the Marauders – they were 'in the know' of enough magic that Hermione and James did not need to hide. Even better, Rose Evans and Dorea Potter got along like a house on fire, and Leonard Evans and Charlus Potter – who were already friendly, along with Sean – gravitated to one another and caught up on their rugby.</p><p>"All I am saying, dear," protested Dorea hotly and loudly, "Is that having a house elf can be beneficial when the baby comes."</p><p>Sirius mimicked gagging. "Until they try to drown you in the tub—"</p><p>"Sirius Black!" shrieked Dorea, her voice rising to a pitch that could shatter glass. Her eyes flashed at the younger Black and her curly hair frizzled.</p><p><em>When the Blacks got upset</em>, thought Hermione in amusement, hiding her smile behind a sip of cider, <em>boy, did they ever show their family resemblance to the Bellatrix and Narcissa she remembered from the Battle of Hogwarts</em>.</p><p>At her side, James stifled a snigger.</p><p>Regulus sighed. "Kreacher never tried to drown you, Sirius—"</p><p>"How would you know, Reg, you're <em>younger</em> than me!"</p><p>"Well, you're still here, aren't you?" asked a deadpan Regulus, causing laughter to break out around the group.</p><p>Sirius loudly booed. "Moony, Wormy, back me up here—"</p><p>"Sorry, Pads," apologized Remus, but he was grinning wolfishly. "Can't; never met your house elf."</p><p>Sirius theatrically shuddered. "Thank <em>Merlin</em>."</p><p>"Oh, he's not that bad, Sirius, stop whinging—"</p><p>"He's a fuc—<em>bloody</em> menace!"</p><p>"Winky's absolutely lovely," interjected Barty, stopping just shy of maliciously gleeful as he needled Sirius – Hermione didn't think either of them would ever get along. She was just happy that despite Barty's reluctance and fear toward Remus, he didn't blame the werewolf for what happened at the Shrieking Shack all those years ago, placing the blame at Sirius's feet instead.</p><p>"See?" preened Dorea. "Growing up, Cobbler was a <em>delight</em>—"</p><p>Ignoring them with long practice, Charlus had engaged Leonard and Sean in a discussion of England chances in the 1981 Five Nations, after they had just won the current championship; Petunia was curiously grilling both Dirk and Lily about their magical careers and comparing them to their non-magical equivalent and stumping all three as they tried to correlate Lily's position as a Charms apprentice to the muggle world. The discussion was hesitant between all three as they raked their brains, puzzled frowns on their faces.</p><p>"—an apprentice is easy enough to compare—"</p><p>"But Charms is really molecular changes—"</p><p>"No, that's transfiguration, one thing into another—"</p><p>Sounding pedantic, Lily recited, "Charms is defined as 'adding or changing the properties of an object; it focuses on altering what the object <em>does</em> as opposed to what the object <em>is</em>.'"</p><p>"Did you get that from Goshawk's <em>Standard Book of Spells</em>?" asked Dirk, trying to keep a straight face.</p><p>Lily flushed and muttered, "It's a really good definition to use, here, in our discussion…"</p><p>Petunia took pity on her younger sister and asked, "What about production? Could we relate it to mercantile or something similar, when taking something and adding or changing properties?"</p><p>Hermione turned her mouth toward James, handing him her cider. "I'm going to begin taking some of these gifts up to the nursery."</p><p>James frowned, eyes pulled from Sirius and Dorea's loud argument. "Do you want help?"</p><p>"I'll help," offered Barty, sitting on Hermione's other side protectively. Regulus turned his head as he caught the offer and nodded, as well.</p><p>James gave Hermione a kiss on the temple as she hefted herself up, hand placed on her back and stomach as her center of gravity was entirely off. James's warm hand hovered near hers on her back, keeping her upright and from toppling one way or another.</p><p>"<em>Mobilicorpus</em>," intoned Regulus and Barty, their wands flicking at the presents piled off to the side on a table. The selection rose and Hermione led the way down the hall and up the stairs, out of sight from the sitting room despite the open doors.</p><p>James let his eyes trail after them, despite knowing that Hermione was more than safe in their own home and with Regulus and Barty at her side. He was distracted when Sirius threw himself in Hermione's warm spot on the couch, sighing loudly.</p><p>"Your mother, I swear," he grunted, causing James to roll his eyes.</p><p>"She's your great-aunt," argued James, half-heartedly. It was an old argument, especially once Sirius moved in with them. "It's the Black family traits."</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes, that time. "Where'd princess go?"</p><p>"Stop calling her that," scowled James, disliking the nickname Sirius had for her. "Your brother and Crouch helped her take the gifts to the nursery."</p><p>"Oh." Sirius blinked. "But there's a few left."</p><p>At James's curious look, Sirius summon them, two presents that had fallen from the table and landed between it and one of the armchairs – the same one Sirius had been sitting in. No wonder he had seen them.</p><p>"Let's take them up," said James, grabbing one from the air with his reflexes while Sirius took the other.</p><p>To the room at large, he announced, "We'll be right back," but only his mother nodded distractedly at him, speaking now to Remus and Peter about something or the other. Feeling slighted, James thought, <em>rude</em>, without heat and left the room.</p><p>The nursery was next to the main bedroom, down the hall and the furthest from the stairs as a safety precaution. The room was large and square – he and Hermione fit in a crib, changing table, rocking chair, drawers and even a plush loveseat and bookshelf filled with children's books. There were windows on two sides, being at the back of the townhouse, spilling in natural light that saturated the room on that spring day.</p><p>Hermione, Regulus and Barty were inside, but the door was ajar, blocking the hallway from their room and given how far their voices were, the three were probably at the furthest point away from the door, by the drawers, as they piled the presents there or on the loveseat.</p><p>James was about to open the door, announcing their presence when Sirius's hand gripped his arm and held him back. James glanced at Sirius. "Pad—?"</p><p>"<em>Sshh</em>!" hissed Sirius, eyes alight with glee.</p><p>"—going to be godfather?"</p><p><em>Oh,</em> thought James, glancing at Sirius. <em>That was what he wanted to know</em>.</p><p>"Sirius is, of course," answered Hermione, answering Barty's question. "That wasn't even a discussion point – it was the easiest decision to make."</p><p>Beside him, Sirius <em>preened</em>.</p><p>"I didn't want to bring this up just yet, though," continued Hermione. "But I was hoping to also ask <em>you</em>, Reg."</p><p>Sirius turned questioning eyes on James, who gave a tiny smile and shrug. Sirius had been the first and only choice in James's mind for godfather in case anything happened to them. Knowing the future Hermione came from though, made him reconsider just <em>one</em> godfather for their child. Sirius had allowed grief to overcome common sense at his and Lily's murder, which led to Harry being raised by Petunia. While Petunia would <em>never</em> treat his son that way in this new time, James didn't want to risk his child's safety and happiness and agreed that a second, more sensible, godparent was needed.</p><p>Enter Regulus Black.</p><p>"I would've asked you, Barty, but…" there was a sound of clothing rustling. "Let's be honest, putting you and Sirius together as godparents is a terrible idea."</p><p>There was a pause, and then Barty said, "Fair enough. And true."</p><p>"Besides, both Black sons as godparents to my child?" continued Hermione, sounding amused.</p><p>Someone snickered – probably Barty.</p><p>"If…" Hermione trailed off, the tone of the room changing from amusement to serious in the span of a single word. "If… the worst happens, Reg… if it all happens again… take Harry and run. Don't… don't let him end up in Dumbledore's hands. Or, god forbid, Voldemort's if there's a spy in the Order."</p><p>There was a moment of horrified silence, then Barty broke it, his voice cracking.</p><p>"That won't happen! It <em>won't</em>! You won't die!"</p><p>At his side, Sirius stiffened in shock, head swinging between the partially closed door and James.</p><p>"It could happen." There was a tremor of tiredness and defeat in Hermione's voice. "Time is in flux – things are changing but some things… they stay the same. So, protecting and taking care of this baby – of <em>Harry</em> – is the most important thing if James or I die. You know that – and you know why. You two are the <em>only</em> ones I'd trust and who could teach him what he needs to know, and the only ones I could ask to finish this if I'm gone."</p><p>Sirius slowly turned his head away from the door to James, eyes piercing. James swallowed thickly, cutting his eyes away from his friends' face and back at the door.</p><p>Regulus swore under his breath. "I'll do it, but don't make me. I swear to Merlin, Hermione, don't make me do this."</p><p>Hermione sounded anguished when she replied, "I'm sorry. If – if it does happen – make sure to check in on Lily and Petunia, too, in case it's an Evans thing and not a Potter thing. Tuney knows enough, but Lily doesn't know anything. She'll be in danger."</p><p>"We'll protect them. I promise."</p><p>"It won't happen," Barty snapped, mulishly.</p><p>"It might," replied Hermione idly.</p><p>The three were silent, their conversation drifting away to introspection. Worried that they would leave the room and spot Sirius on the landing – and James honestly wasn't sure if he wanted Sirius to know what happened to him in that other future – James grabbed Sirius and dragged him away, barely thinking but absently casting a silencing charm on their shoes to avoid making noise.</p><p>By the stairs, Sirius yanked away from James and stared at him. "James. What the fuck was that."</p><p>"It's nothing."</p><p>"Nothing?" repeated Sirius, incredulously. "You said that about your conversation with Dumbledore at the Order meeting, too, and I let that drop. What did Hermione mean, <em>if things happen again</em>? Or <em>time is in flux</em>?" He ran a hand through his artfully styled waves and laughed – but it was a tad hysterical. "That can't mean – surely, it doesn't mean what I think—"</p><p>Trying to diffuse the situation, James gave a fake laugh. "What are you talking about, Pads? It was a joke. Who knows what in-jokes those three have that I'll – we'll – never know?"</p><p>Even to his ears, he heard how obviously fake and bad it was, and by Sirius's pained face, he knew he didn't succeed.</p><p>"James," whispered Sirius, eyes wide. "I – you'd tell me if there was something I need to know, right? Right? Like, if Dumbledore told you something – something about us – about you, and Hermione? About… about your sprog?"</p><p>James pressed his lips together.</p><p>"James?" Sirius's voice raised in pitch, shaking at the end, in tension, fear. "James, what did they mean? What do they know?"</p><p>It may have been Hermione's story to tell, but James couldn't even bring himself to think about telling Sirius at that moment.</p><p>"Sirius," begged James, lowering his voice. There was a hint of steel in it. He firmed his stance and threw his shoulders back a bit as he stood straighter. It was an authoritative position, and despite being shorter than Sirius, he watched as Sirius cowed the slightest bit. "Please, don't. Drop it. Ignore what you heard. It's nothing."</p><p>Then he turned on his heel and began down the stairs, not even looking back if Sirius was following. He left his best friend on the landing at the top of the stairs, in shock, in silence.</p><p><em>Was this how Hermione felt, all those years? Never telling those closest to her until she had no choice?</em> wondered James, a sour taste in his mouth as he strode into the kitchen, to the sink. He gripped the edge of the countertop, leaning over it as he dry-heaved, desperately trying to keep the cake he had eaten earlier from coming up.</p><p>The fear of what Sirius would do if he knew Peter <em>might</em> be a spy – the rage that would overtake him – the threat of Azkaban –</p><p>James wouldn't do it. He couldn't.</p><p>Hermione kept quiet to protect people and take that burden on her shoulders to save the world so that people like James, Lily, Sirius, Remus – and so many others – would have a better life. It was no less for James to do the same.</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC…</p>

  <p align="center">Yesterday is Tomorrow (Everything is Connected)</p><p align="center">TWENTY-SIX</p><hr /><p>The only world I ever gave a damn about, was the one with you in it. All this bullshit. Everything I've done, is so you have a place to go back to. That's it. – James Cole, <em>12 Monkeys</em> (TV show)</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>June 1980</strong>
</p><p>Historians would later say, in updated versions of <em>The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts</em>, that that summer was the turning point in Voldemort's war. And James would agree with them.</p><p>Things seemed to happen simultaneously, although in truth they happened days apart; only, everything ran together in James's mind, an ever on-going and escalating mess of skirmishes, wounded soldiers, late-night raids, partnering with Obliviators from the Accidents and Catastrophes department, Moody's growing gruffness and agitation, Dumbledore's face becoming grimmer, and the tense, nerve-wracking paranoia amongst not just the Order of the Pheonix, but the Auror Corps., as well.</p><p>On a Tuesday, the <em>Prophet</em> ran a full-page spread of Voldemort's green glowing calling card, the Dark Mark, hovering above Westminster with bolded text: <em>terror strikes at muggle parliament!</em></p><p>On a Wednesday, James spent more time at work, running with the Obliviators as they did clean up. Later that day, when he was completing paperwork at the Auror office, Osbert Mockridge ran in, blood running down the side of his face, shouting, "Attack! Attack! There's been an attack in the Beasts division!"</p><p>All the Aurors had stared at him blindly for a moment before jumping up and racing out and toward the lift, heading to the fourth floor and emerging to chaos: James spotted Hermione's friend Dirk Cresswell, pale-faced and bleeding from a head wound but crouched behind an overturned desk and shooting off well-aimed spells at another man who stood cackling in the middle of the spirits division, even as he threw wide beams of spellfire and light across the room. There were several fires, two on curtains and one in a rubbish bin, and there were several hurt employees crawling to safety even as the air sizzled with magic.</p><p>"What the hell's going on?" asked James, throwing himself down beside Cresswell. Other Aurors from the department hesitated at sending anything at the mad wizard, but a few took potshots.</p><p>At Cresswell's other side, the familiar and slightly older Amos Diggory snorted. "It's bloody Abrams," the man scowled. "From Magical Sports. Walked in here, asking for paperwork from Swiftspell because MacFarlan asked for it and then when ol' Swifty asked what Magical Sports needed the Beasts for, he killed him dead."</p><p>"<em>What?</em>" gaped James. "Like… Avada…?"</p><p>Amos gave a terse nod.</p><p>"Holy hells," breathed James, eyeing the cackling wizard, even as Moody nailed him with a well-placed stunner that sent the man crumbling to the ground.</p><p>It was only later that James learned the wizard had been placed under the Imperius curse and had no knowledge of the last four days since he had attended a Quidditch match with Ludo Bagman, causing the man's coworker to be called in for questioning.</p><p>When James told Cresswell that later, the fellow Gryffindor alum frowned. "That's not good."</p><p>"What isn't?"</p><p>"Imperius," explained Cresswell, face lined and wane from stress. "The others in the department are already eying each other for betrayal, but… before we just heard about it – out there, you know? Now, it's in our workplace." Worry flooded Cresswell's eyes. "It's in our homes. How can we protect ourselves?"</p><p><em>We can't</em>, thought James, but he didn't answer. Instead, he told Cresswell to be safe, and wished him goodnight, despite his own dry mouth and shaking hands.</p><p>On Thursday, he was called to the scene of a rather gruesome werewolf attack, body parts left behind and flung around the clearing in the woods. The muggle campers who had been the unfortunate prey had suffered greatly in their final moments, their tents and camp gear spread across several miles that took nearly all day to find, and longer to come up with a plausible explanation for the muggle police.</p><p>He had a respite from work on Friday but was called into an Order meeting despite his terse words with Dumbledore at their last meeting. James found himself tucked in a far corner, listening with growing annoyance and wariness as Dearborn and Dumbledore's agendas didn't align, as the Prewett twins urged retaliation, as the few from the Auror department grumbled and spoke in praise of Crouch's growing success in harsher measures for criminals.</p><p>"But I just don't understand, Dumbledore," said one Order member, a whine coming through in his voice. "What are we waiting for? Through our contacts at the Auror department, we <em>know</em> who his followers are—"</p><p>"Thanks to Reg and the Princess," muttered Sirius, next to James, who scowled at that stupid nickname.</p><p>"—We should be working <em>with</em> them," continued the same man in confusion, face scrunched up. "Can we not remove the blight where we know it is? None of us are strong enough to face You-Know-Who—"</p><p>"As I've said before," answered Dumbledore, his voice terse, "We cannot be seen to be operating outside of the law—"</p><p>"I'd think the Aurors would welcome it," muttered someone else, to a few resounding, "hear, hear's" from others in the room, making Dumbledore's mouth flatten in annoyance.</p><p>"<em>I</em> heard Crouch's brother is in town," someone else – someone from the Corp. that James vaguely knew – said, in a tone of gleeful office gossip. "Wallace Crouch – he's from the ICW—"</p><p>"There's a prophecy."</p><p>"Caradoc!" snapped Dumbledore, turning to face his long-time friend. "Enough!"</p><p>James stiffened, and Sirius, at his side, felt the movement and glanced at him, brow furrowed before smoothing his face to be a blank mask.</p><p>But the box had been opened, and voices rang together:</p><p>"A <em>prophecy</em>?"</p><p>"Is it about You-Know-Who? Can he be defeated?"</p><p>"Who is the prophecy about? How do you know?"</p><p>"Dearborn is an Unspeakable, isn't he? Did he hear it?"</p><p>"SILENCE!" thundered Dumbledore, raising his voice. The air simmered, liquid from the few cups of coffee and several ales drifted up in droplets out of their mugs, and the end of Gideon's tie curled and rose from against his shirt. This frightened enough people that the voices died down and people stared, open-mouthed, at him. He calmed himself, although there was still ire in the lines of his face when he glanced at Dearborn, who clenched his jaw, making his burn turn white, as he looked away.</p><p>But Moody spoke up, his voice gruff. "Is there a prophecy, Dumbledore?"</p><p>Dumbledore hesitated a moment. "Yes. Yes, Alastor, there is."</p><p>James clenched his hands at his side, staring hard at Dumbledore. <em>Don't you dare,</em> he thought, heart furiously pounding in his chest. <em>Don't you dare speak it or mention Hermione—</em></p><p>"Well?" continued Moody, his voice a bark. "Give us a gist so we know what the plan is."</p><p>Dearborn went to open his mouth, but Dumbledore quickly spoke over him. "There is… potentially one who can defeat Voldemort."</p><p>"No potentially," muttered Dearborn. "She bloody can but won't."</p><p>Moody's eyes glanced between the two.</p><p>"She," he repeated, baldly. "Have you approached this witch?"</p><p>Dumbledore inclined his head. "She was approached some time ago but declined to join the Order."</p><p>Shocked gasps rang through the room.</p><p>"But why would someone do that?" asked Alice, a hand darting out to grip her husband's tightly while her hand rested on her pregnant belly.</p><p>"She felt that the Order was not for her," explained Dumbledore, trying to keep vague. "There was a disagreement of philosophy."</p><p>Beside him, Gideon's pronounced frown smoothed out as something passed over him, a kind of understanding. He caught Fabian's eyes and widened his own, making Fabian quietly groan and bury his face in his hands for a moment. James wondered if they realized it was Hermione – he knew she, Regulus, Petunia, and Sean had <em>something</em> happen with the twins but his wife, sister-in-law and her husband were all rather vague about it, refusing to speak of the incident. James narrowed his eyes at the twins. Maybe he needed to have <em>words</em> with them…</p><p>Concern flickered across Moody's face. "Do we need to be concerned about another faction entering this war?"</p><p>Dumbledore paused. "No… I do not think so. I am certain she is not working alone, as there were others who declined to join us who are known associates of hers…"</p><p><em>Skirting close there, Dumbledore</em>, thought James, swallowing thickly, hands clenched.</p><p>Beside him, Sirius blinked and then his eyes widened, and James could see the Quidditch players zooming around in circles as his brain began to work things out, making connections, pulling the comments together…</p><p>"We should try again," suggested Alice, as she looked around the room. "Things have changed since you last asked, I'm certain—"</p><p>"I can ask her," volunteered Lily, making James want to laugh hysterically at the idea of Hermione's <em>sister</em> approaching her to join the Order. Even Lily discovering the truth that <em>Hermione </em>was the object of the prophecy would be one step too far: while the two had reconciled, neither was on the best of terms and if Lily learned Hermione turned down the Order <em>ages</em> ago and knew of a prophecy – something Hermione disdained rather vocally – well… James didn't want to be at <em>that</em> family meeting, especially with both witches pregnant.</p><p>Options for reaching out to Hermione – not that any of them knew it was her, other than himself, Dumbledore, and Dearborn (although James amended that at the stricken look on Fabian's face and Gideon's own exasperated one meant they were aware of who the Chosen One was) – were put on hold when a wispy Patronus entered the room, hovering above the table and near to Dumbledore.</p><p>"Headmaster," the transparent badger with an unfamiliar voice to James began, "Information just came in from the muggle PM's office. There are strange lights and odd people managing to take out the Queen's defences at Balmoral castle. The muggle royal family isn't there, but it's causing a ruckus. Come immediately."</p><p>Dumbledore's face hardened. "We must go. Everyone, prepare yourselves."</p><p>There was frantic energy as people stood and began fussing, dashing out of the room and to the anti-apparation ward boundaries. James made his own way and a set pace – neither rushing nor lagging – with Peter and Sirius; Remus had failed to attend the last few meetings, much to both Peter and Sirius's disgruntled remarks. But James knew he had been sent to the werewolf packs, a futile effort on Dumbledore's part, thanks to Hermione's future knowledge.</p><p>Peter was wringing his hands next to him, muttering spells under his breath. James barely spared him a glance, more concerned about whether Dearborn would tell everyone it was Hermione that the prophecy referred to while he was gone, unable to stare at Dumbledore and mentally imagine all the things he would do to the headmaster should he reveal Hermione's identity.</p><p>"I think I'm going to be ill," muttered Peter, turning vaguely green. "I don't think I can Apparate."</p><p>James glanced at him. "Thinking of staying back, Wormtail?"</p><p>Relief suffused Peter's face. "D'you think I could?"</p><p>Before he could reply, they reached the ward boundary, where Frank and Alice stood, eyeing the trio as they approached.</p><p>"Ready, Potter?" called Frank, an easy grin on his face despite the tense worry lines on his forehead. "Black, Pettigrew?"</p><p>"Pete's not feeling too confident in his Apparation – can you Side-Along him, Longbottom?" asked James when they were within an arm's length. He only felt the tiniest stirring of guilt when Peter shot him a betrayed look.</p><p>Frank stifled a laugh. "Sure. I remember his first Apparation test at Hogwarts."</p><p>"…Thanks," said Peter, disgruntled. But Frank reached out and clasped a hand on his shoulder, clamping down, and with a spin, they, along with Alice (although given her state, she was probably going home), were gone, leaving James and Sirius alone.</p><p>James sighed and went to spin on his heel, although thinking of his destination in his mind when Sirius's hand grabbed his arm. James looked at it, and then up at Sirius, who was looking at him rather intently.</p><p>"James," he said, quietly, standing very still, "You'd tell me if there was something going on, right?"</p><p>Weakly, James murmured, "Yeah, 'course I would, Padfoot."</p><p>"James."</p><p>"C'mon, Sirius, we gotta go," he tried instead, drawing his arm away from Sirius's hand, even as he tried to tighten his grip. "We gotta go save the world."</p><p>Sirius narrowed his eyes. "<em>James</em>—"</p><p>But James ripped his arm from him, spinning forcibly, and letting the horrible feeling of being sucked through a tube push him from the meeting location in Dorset much, much further north to Scotland.</p><hr /><p>Voldemort was straddling the line between the two worlds carefully – even as his attacks grew bolder and more brazen. The Balmoral attack was one thing, sending his Death Eaters out to cause chaos and kill a few muggles, sowing terror wherever possible, and more importantly: scatter the Order into smaller, more manageable groups to attack.</p><p>He had more men. That was a fact.</p><p>They weren't afraid; they were disinclined to honour duels or draw to first blood – they wanted to kill. That was also a fact.</p><p>It was also a fact that the Order could barely keep their heads above the water. They didn't have enough people fighting alongside them; they kept to legalities and didn't kill, determined to show that they operated within the law, lest they become as lawless and rabid as the Death Eaters.</p><p>It didn't work, back when Voldemort began to escalate his attacks when Dumbledore had asked Hermione to join, and it didn't work <em>now</em>, years later, with James pressing up against the crumbly, damp brick of a warehouse in a seedy port area of Aberdeen, leftover from the industrial revolution when they built ships. It was still used as a seaside port, with a maze of stacked shipping containers, and swinging chains hanging from cranes. There were a few barges, all dark with only a few lights on, with gangplanks extended from their decks to the concrete and cement dockyards. Somewhere, beyond the shipping containers, they heard a scream that cut off abruptly. There were also several flashes of light, lighting up the spaces between the containers and slipping through cracks – bright purples, sickly yellows, and a familiar green.</p><p>Sirius, at his side, had a gash across his forehead and his shoulder had popped out of the socket (James had helped him put it back in), but Sirius held his arm stiffly against himself to keep from moving it, <em>ferula</em> bandaging the arm in a makeshift sling. With a furrow between his dark eyebrows, Sirius muttered, "What do we do?"</p><p>"We wait a moment," replied James, peering out into the darkness, down the aisle between containers.</p><p>"For what?"</p><p>A somewhat familiar form of an Order member raced around one of the containers, frantic as they stumbled, sending loose rock and chipped stone skittering away. Something had eaten away at their leg, and they were clearly in agony with the way they were limping, their trousers in tatters and blood streaming down against skin mottled and fleshy.</p><p>Low laughter followed the Order member as two Death Eaters emerged from the same direction they came from, around a stack of shipping containers. One teasingly sent a spell that tore up concrete by the Order member's feet, sending them tripping and landing hard. The Order member flipped on their back and began scrambling, pulling themselves in a crabwalk backward to get away. Their mangled, partially eaten leg trailed behind, leaving a gory streak of blood and fabric. They were nearly out of James and Sirius's sight, pressed against the brick of the warehouse.</p><p>"That," replied James in a quiet murmur, bringing his wand up. With a flick, the two-tiered shipping containers in front of him and Sirius shot forward.</p><p>"What the—"</p><p>The containers slammed into the Death Eaters, neither prepared, and continued forward until they hit the containers opposite, squishing the two wizards in-between. There was a mild noise of surprise, and then silence.</p><p>The Order member was frozen, staring at where they had been, mouth open.</p><p>James stepped out from the wall, moving toward his Order colleague. Sirius, after a moment's hesitation, followed, eyes alert.</p><p>"You – you –" sputtered the Order member when James crouched at his side, eyeing the leg. A few basic healing spells would help until they received specialized help. "Potter, you <em>killed</em> them!"</p><p>"Yes," answered James calmly, although his heart was racing, and his hands were shaking. He had the vaguest feeling he was going to throw up, but it would be best to not do so on the other wizard's gory leg. "I did."</p><p>"Dumbledore says—"</p><p>"I don't <em>care</em> what Dumbledore says or wants," spat James, hazel eyes darting up to glare at the wizard from the rim of his glasses. "Nor you. You'd be dead, so I'll take your gratitude instead of accusations, thank you."</p><p>The wizard's eyes went wide, and they sputtered some more.</p><p>When nothing sensical emerged from the wizard, James's mouth flattened and he tapped the man's emergency portkey. In a startling whirl of colours – it seems there were no anti-apparation or portkey wards in place – the wizard disappeared.</p><p>"He's not wrong," said Sirius quietly, staring down at James. His eyes were dark. "You <em>did</em> kill them."</p><p>"And I'll freak out about it later when I'm at home with my pregnant wife," replied James, standing. "When I'm home and alive."</p><p>Sirius swallowed thickly. "It just seems that—"</p><p>"That what?"</p><p>"That you're… unaffected," finished Sirius, glancing away, jaw tense.</p><p>"I'm not," replied James instantly, eyes darting around the open space in front of the warehouse and the grubby, yellowed panels near the roof. He spotted a gap between two containers, a dark recess, and began to walk in that direction, Sirius on his heels.</p><p>"Prongs, you <em>killed</em>—"</p><p>"I know what I did, Sirius," snapped James, slipping into the gap, and letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. "But you tell me – what would have happened if we managed to apprehend those Death Eaters? You know as well as I do that it would've been difficult, to begin with, given that <em>they</em> don't care about killing us. And as Aurors, we know that we might try to throw the book at them, but they'll get out of Auror holding by citing some grandfathered law."</p><p>"That doesn't mean we should kill them, James," replied his best friend, his voice serious and low. "We shouldn't become what we're fighting."</p><p>James turned; his shoulders brushed the containers' cool metal on either side of him in the tight space. He could see the whites of Sirius' eyes and the faint, dull glint of the metal buttons on his jacket.</p><p>"Do you think I'm going Dark?" asked James, curiously.</p><p>Sirius paused. "I – no. You're not using Dark magic."</p><p><em>Yet</em>, the sentence finished.</p><p>James frowned, anxiety racing up his spine. "Do you think I <em>will</em>?"</p><p>The pause was longer this time, and Sirius's words were hesitant and haltingly said, indicating his own worry as it bled through. "I think that this war, and the way it's escalating, has a way of pulling even the best of us into the shadows. And… and I think something happened recently and it's causing you to slip quicker."</p><p>James turned back to face forward; his mouth turned down in a grim line. Sirius wasn't wrong – Hermione's knowledge was always certainly at the forefront of anything he did recently. The knowledge that whatever they had done <em>now</em>, in her previous timeline, did nothing to stop the second rise of Voldemort and his Death Eaters was a bitter, acrid taste in James' mouth. The only way to end things properly so that his son didn't grow up to fight in another war, was to end it <em>now</em>.</p><p>Permanently.</p><p>Maybe when this was all over – when they had won, when they didn't have to fight any longer – James would take Sirius aside and confess it all. Sirius would rant and rave, probably even throw a punch, and then sulk and ignore James for a few days, before he came back and they'd make up, best friends, brothers, once more. But until then… he wouldn't dump that burden on him.</p><p>"Let's go," he muttered instead, walking forward. After a moment, he heard Sirius sigh and then his steps, shuffling-like, behind him and knew he was following.</p><p>The gap between shipping containers was a dark maze of tight aisles that led off in different directions. Sound bounced around them, flitting from metal container to metal container and ringing disproportionately, making Sirius tense and James constantly pause, thinking a Death Eater was just behind or in front of them.</p><p>Distantly, they could hear someone shout something, and echoing <em>bang</em>s that made James' shoulders tighten in worry. Was that bang the sound of someone being slammed against a container? Was it someone they knew who was badly injured or died?</p><p>"We can't keep this up," whispered Sirius eventually, bringing a hand to James' shoulder, keeping him from moving. "We need to know where they are."</p><p>"Then let's go up," suggested James, tilting his head back. He muttered a sticking charm to his shoes and then, with his back against one container, eased step-by-step upward, Sirius next to him.</p><p>He glanced over and Sirius grinned. "Just like fourth year, yeah?"</p><p>James snorted despite himself. He remembered that stupid prank, where both nearly got caught by Flitwick and ended up using sticking charms on their hands and knees to hang from the ceiling. Flitwick still caught them when he was called in by McGonagall several hours later, helping to undo their charm, which had been too strong and left them up there all night.</p><p>At the top of the container, James cautiously peeked over the rim, looking forward and then craning his neck over his shoulder, seeing a clear view in all directions. He pushed off with his feet and hauled himself up, nonverbally cancelling the spell and then helping Sirius up.</p><p>On top of four stacked containers, they could see the roof clearing the warehouse, the docks, harbour, and back toward the city – and also the skirmish between Moody and Dearborn as they held off against four of Voldemort's Death Eaters, and a few other stragglers between Dumbledore's Order.</p><p>A cackle made Sirius stiffen. "Oh, fuck. Bella's here."</p><p>"Then so must be her husband," muttered James, peering down at the ring of attackers, popping up from overturned crates, a burning car, and out of darkened recesses between containers. Moody was taking advantage of the environment, but Dearborn was holding his ground and volleying sizzling spells that were brushed off by the Death Eater he was facing, sending those spells skittering into the air.</p><p>"C'mon, let's help them!" James darted forward, his boots slapping on the metal as they raced across the long line of containers, their colours blurring as they dashed forward, running parallel at one point.</p><p>"Confringo!" shouted Sirius, lining up a shot. The spell rammed, hard, into two Death Eaters who had nicely stood still for him, sending both blasting away. One crumpled to the ground when they bounced off a shipping container, and the other haphazardly rolled and skidded across the pavement, causing Bellatrix and two other Death Eaters to jump out of the way.</p><p>Moody let out a loud <em>ha-HA</em> in triumph, taking advantage of the interruption to send a sickly-looking yellow spell at one wizard, who swore and conjured a bronze shield, only to watch it be eaten by the spell's acidic properties.</p><p>Sirius leapt from the tops of the containers, slamming into the side of the wall of containers opposite and clutching at the edge before using the momentum to turn and push off. He landed on one of the upturned crates and displayed his athleticism, rolling right off it to the ground, taking up a support position with Moody.</p><p>James crouched, one knee on the cold metal, looking down at the mixed combatants.</p><p>"Cousin!" shrieked Bellatrix, face on display. Her hair, a curly mass, frizzled up the same way her eyes did, lighting on him with a gleam of insanity. "Welcome! Welcome to your death!"</p><p>"Promises, promises," called back Sirius, throwing himself down when the tall wizard next to Bellatrix idly sent the green of the Killing Curse his way. He, too, did not wear a mask: it was Rodolphus Lestrange, his face placid and cunning as his dark eyes trailed from Sirius and Moody to Dearborn, who had stopped flinging spells, watching the standoff with wary eyes, to James, high above them.</p><p>"Will you be joining us, Potter?" he called, his tone of distant politeness, like one inquiring about someone's job at a Ministry function when introduced for the first time. His voice was also <em>much</em> deeper than James expected. His eyes drifted past him. "Is your wife joining us, as well?"</p><p>A flush of anger suffused James' body. Through gritted teeth, he spat, "Just me tonight, Lestrange."</p><p>"Disappointing," the man replied, almost monotonous.</p><p>Bellatrix huffed. "It matters not! You will all meet your end tonight! For he comes! The Dark Lord is here!"</p><p>Sirius took a moment to look around, exaggeratingly. "Well, I don't see him. Has he been held up by some important torture or raid, Bella?"</p><p>She scowled, opening her mouth to respond when a chilling cold wind swept over them.</p><p>"Oh, hells," muttered Moody.</p><p>The air seemed to freeze; James looked down to see a spiderweb of frost creep its way along the top of the container and he threw himself over the edge, hanging on precariously for a moment before letting himself fall the second the frost hit his bare hand.</p><p>He landed awkwardly, but without spraining anything, clutching at his reddened hand, stiff from the cold.</p><p>Above them, clouds of inky black swirled and lightning crackled through it, consolidating into a thick mass on the ground behind Bellatrix and Rodolphus, taking human form as the Dark Lord Voldemort stepped through the smoke, wearing black robes. His red eyes trailed over the four Order members, his downed Death Eaters, and those who remained standing.</p><p>It was surreal for James, standing before the wizard who, in another life, had killed him. A wizard he had gone up against with nothing more than his body and wits. In that life, he didn't last long, lulled into security. He may have defied Voldemort three times in that world – but in this world? He had his wand, his wits, and his entire future at stake.</p><p>Grimly, determination filled James, from the tips of his toes, up to his legs and across his chest like a burning promise, making him lightheaded and then trailing down to his fingers, making them tingle as they wrapped around his wand tightly.</p><p><em>I'm not waiting this time,</em> he thought, and without ceremony, thought <em>expulso</em>, the soft blue of the spell racing across the distance between them.</p><p>Voldemort batted it away lazily, turning partially to face him.</p><p>"James Potter," he hissed, voice sibilant and vaguely surprised. "I had not thought to see you here."</p><p>"Why's that?" spat James, swallowing his nerves.</p><p>There was a parody of a smile on Voldemort's thin lips. "Why, if you are here, who is with your wife?"</p><p>Fear took over James' brain. There was white noise, a buzz surrounding him, and it took several moments for him to realize Sirius was shouting, "She's fine, James! You know that! She's fine! He's just trying to get under your skin!"</p><p>He shuddered and tipped his chin upward challengingly when he settled his eyes on the Dark Lord. "She's well protected where she is and doesn't need <em>me</em> to protect her. After all, didn't she best <em>you</em>?"</p><p>Bellatrix howled in anger, offended for her master. Voldemort, however, shifted his facial muscles to look like he was quirking an eyebrow despite having none.</p><p>"So afraid, boy," he murmured, his voice temptation. "Why not lay down your wand? Submit to me, Potter. I can be a kind and just master. I can promise safety for your wife, despite the times we fought in the past."</p><p><em>Never,</em> thought James, his face hard.</p><p>"There's no need to be afraid. We do not need to fight."</p><p>"Don't listen to him, James!" shouted Sirius, peeking over the edge of the crate. Bellatrix hissed and an entire chunk of wood went spinning into the air when it collided with the corner of the crate; it sent Sirius back into hiding behind it.</p><p>"Has Dumbledore truly been such a good leader? Has he been kind to you? Has he understood your fears? Taken into consideration your worries?" each question burned into James' mind, sending his heart thundering. "You have been disappointed and adrift lately, have you not, Potter?"</p><p>"He's playing you, Potter," warned Moody, his voice gravelly and carrying. "This is what he does, gets inside people's heads – don't listen—"</p><p>"<em>SILENCE!</em>" the air around them stilled as a nonverbal spell rippled across the opening between shipping containers, rendering all silent, the air around them sucked away.</p><p>James fell to his knees, gasping, struggling to breathe for air that was no longer there. He looked up, squinting from behind his glasses; Voldemort was the only one unaffected, watching them writhe on the ground bemusedly. Even Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and the two other masked Death Eaters weren't immune to the man's spell and command.</p><p>Feeling lightheaded, James dug into himself and found his strength. Eyes slid past the Dark Lord, on the containers, and with a twitch, he poured himself into his spell and creation, the image of what he wanted firm in his mind.</p><p>Behind Voldemort, the topmost container shifted, metal screeching against metal.</p><p>He paused, tilting his head a bit with it moving to place an ear in that direction, although the rest of him stilled. Then—</p><p>The container warped, metal shrieking against metal and sparks flew as bits ground together as the entire contained merged with those behind and below it, warping into a bulbous shape at first that elongated, doors flying open and revealing themselves as wings.</p><p>The containers in its new form roared – a terrible grinding sound of crashing metal and sparks – and the dragon threw itself down and forward from where it perched, toward the Dark Lord.</p><p>Amused, the man threw his arms out and welcomed the metal creature, releasing his hold on his spell.</p><p>James collapsed, hitting his chin on the pavement as he greedily sucked in air, struggling to keep his eyes on his transfigured dragon as it opened its giant metal maw and attempted to swallow the wizard.</p><p>A giant hole punched through the dragon's jaw, sending sharp shards in James' direction. He hastily threw up a shield that blocked the debris. The dragon roared and drew back, revealing Voldemort, that same amused smile on his face as he twirled his wrist and liquid erupted from it, hissing, and spitting when colliding with the metal.</p><p>Bellatrix threw herself forward, toward Sirius, who retaliated with spellfire, Moody at his side. Dearborn focused on Rodolphus, who moved lazily and carefully, weaving in and out of his attempts like a snake to a snake charmer's tune.</p><p>James focused on Voldemort, the only one left to do so. His dragon, slick and already wounded, took flight. It landed on the shipping containers and its metal claws tore them up, leaving deep gouges.</p><p>Voldemort laughed in delight.</p><p>James darted forward, slipping a little, and sent spell after spell, sending the wizard on a back step, deflecting the shots wildly in all directions.</p><p>The dragon roared and swept down again; its metal wings spread, clipping Bellatrix, who bounced off the wing, spinning around and laughing loudly as she fell. She then jumped up, sending sparks and flames everywhere in response.</p><p>James wove under one jet of fire, sending a loose bit of metal from his dragon's scales that came loose when Voldemort first attacked, flying. Midflight, the metal rippled and smoothed, its edges then going serrated into a spinning disc.</p><p>"Good, good!" praised Voldemort, watching as it boomeranged around, bouncing off a container and then back toward the witch. "Go for the kill, James!"</p><p>"You can call me <em>Potter</em>!" shouted James through gritted teeth. "We're not <em>friends</em>!"</p><p>Voldemort indulged his temper tantrum, the spells he used driving James back, forcing him to move around wood and metal debris, but also the limited space available. Dearborn and Rodolphus kept to their area, keeping to limited footwork and treating their fight like a champion's duel in the arena, planted strong; Sirius and Moody were throwing themselves back and forth, across whatever they could, to engage Bellatrix who was a force of nature herself, cackling and spinning, integrating her spellwork with her wrist twirls and heel turns.</p><p>James ducked under friendly fire from Moody's wand, watching as it hit a container and split the metal open from bottom to top, hot air escaping with a loud hiss. "Moody!"</p><p>The man didn't reply, but Sirius glanced over. "Sorry!"</p><p>"You cannot win," said Voldemort, that parody of a smile still on his face. "Where will you go? There's four of you – and two of my men and myself – and yet you are struggling. Give in, James. Put your wand down. Let everything go. I can be merciful."</p><p>The dragon roared from the opposite end of the strip of pavement, the magic creating it bursting with James' emotions. It charged forward, heedless of anything in its way. Its metal head tossed wooden crates back and forth, sending wood splintering.</p><p>Voldemort blasted it in one direction, sending it careening into the tower of containers. Those containers creaked and wobbled, and James threw up his arms and stabilized them from collapsing down. But the dragon shook the hit off and charged forward again, leaning heavily against the containers. Metal screeched.</p><p>Voldemort sent another volley of spells, each more devastating than the last as the acid ate into the metal face of the dragon; a cutting spell of some kind destroyed a leg, making it limp forward. But each hit it took was another meter forward, another step closer to the Dark Lord, who was forced to back up and give ground. The smile was no longer on his face, but instead a look of pure, intense concentration.</p><p>The dragon, teetering forward unsteadily, opened its metal mouth and roared, the shriek of metal against metal. Voldemort peered into the gap, including the hole he had made earlier in its jaw, and then sent a single blasting spell down its mouth and throat. The dragon exploded from the inside out, sending metal everywhere.</p><p>He threw up a <em>protego</em> shield, ignoring the <em>twang</em> of metal as they pinged off the containers or against the pavement. The dragon collapsed in front of him, a final, weak groan as the spell holding it together dissipated into a metallic dust cloud, reverting the pieces into sheet metal.</p><p>"MASTER!" shrieked Bellatrix in warning.</p><p>From behind the dust cloud, James emerged, throwing himself over the dragon's metal remains. He pushed off the thick back with one hand, his wand arm extended, and the end of his wand charged with a familiar green spell. He opened his mouth, summoning up the proper emotion, one that he knew he would have to use if he wanted to end <em>everything</em>.</p><p>"<em>Ava—</em>"</p><p>Then something slammed into him, sending him off to the side, against a shipping container and tumbling through metal, making a loud clang.</p><p>"James!" shouted Sirius, abandoning his fight with Bellatrix to rush to his side. He levitated pieces of metal off his groaning best friend. "James, are you alright?"</p><p>James rubbed his head, his hand coming away wet with blood, fixing his askew glasses. He took the offered hand and let Sirius haul him upright. "Yeah, m'fine."</p><p>Sirius peered at him worriedly.</p><p>But James' gaze was beyond him, warily eyeing the Dark Lord who paused in his attack, not pressing his advantage. The wizard's own red eyes were not on James, either, but the heaving, bulky form of Caradoc Dearborn, face twisted in anger and hate but still the one who stopped James from performing the Killing Curse – and from killing the mortal Dark Lord.</p><p>Moody muttered something under his breath.</p><p>"How interesting," the Dark Lord murmured, eyes narrowing.</p><p>Dearborn stared back, his face unreadable.</p><p>"Come," commanded Voldemort, his face blank of all thought as he took one final look at James, panting and slick with sweat. And then he twirled, his entire being turned into smoke that shot straight up into the air and into the cloud cover. Rodolphus was close behind, his <em>crack</em> echoing across the dockyard.</p><p>With a look of pure loathing, Bellatrix sent a final sneer toward him and Sirius, twisting on her heel and disappearing with a loud crack.</p><p>James threw his head back and let loose a ragged, hoarse yell of frustration. His hands clenched tight at his side and his wand creaked under the strain and the tip pulsed a vivid red. He whirled around, face red, facing Dearborn.</p><p>Sirius took a step closer to him, and muttered, "Easy, Prongs – steady on, mate—"</p><p>"What the <em>fuck</em> what that, Dearborn?" spat James, ignoring Sirius. "I had him!"</p><p>Dearborn raised a skeptical eyebrow. "<em>You</em> had the Dark Lord, Potter? Really?"</p><p><em>He's mortal!</em> James wanted to reply, but instead, he exhaled loudly, sharply. He cooled his ire as best as he could despite the raging fire in him, his trembling hands. He closed his eyes for a few moments, took another breath, and then when he opened them to look at Dearborn, he saw the slightest hint of discomfort pass over the older man's face.</p><p>"Potter…"</p><p>"I had him, Dearborn, and <em>you</em> stopped the war from ending tonight," said James coolly, his voice clipped and sharp. "Everyone who dies from here on out? That's on <em>you</em>."</p><p>"Potter, <em>you know why</em>—" Frustration leaked through Dearborn.</p><p>"Did it ever occur to you," bit James, voice cutting like diamonds, "that I might know more than you?"</p><p>Dearborn froze. "I – no – that's not –"</p><p>Sirius, at James's side, looked warily between the two.</p><p>"Piss off, Dearborn, you sanctimonious shit." The look James sent Dearborn could have curdled milk.</p><p>Dearborn's face purpled in rage. "Listen here, Potter—"</p><p>"Potter. Black!"</p><p>James turned his head only the tiniest, keeping Dearborn in sight, even as Moody approached them. He had a long, bloody streak that cut through his eye, wobbling a bit as he hobbled toward them.</p><p>"Merlin's balls, Moody, when the fuck did that happen to you?" exclaimed Sirius. "I was literally right there."</p><p>"Lestrange happened after you dicked off, Black," the man replied dryly. "The elder – Rodolphus, just before he Apparated out. Nearly split my head in two with a cutting curse. Anyway – got him back nicely, too, despite my eye."</p><p>"Your eye?" Sirius looked vaguely green.</p><p>"Pretty sure it's a lost cause at this point," answered Moody easily. "Didn't get to Mungo's in time, did I?"</p><p>Sirius was <em>definitely</em> green.</p><p>"Right-o, need you two boys in at the office. I've got a few dark wizards that need processing from tonight," continued Moody easily, despite his remaining good eye focusing on the antagonism between James and Dearborn. "Book 'em for public assault on an Auror if you need something and they don't reveal more during questioning."</p><p>"Got it, boss," replied Sirius, tugging on James' arm. "C'mon, James."</p><p>"This isn't finished, boy," said Dearborn lowly, but his voice carried and the four heard him loud and clear.</p><p>"You bet your damn arse it is," shot back James, a scowl on his face.</p><p>"<em>James</em>," hissed Sirius, tugging harder.</p><p>He allowed himself to be tugged along, until they were a few feet away and then Sirius side-along apparated them both to the Ministry apparation point, a loud <em>crack</em> echoing in the empty marble chamber.</p><p>"Come on, Jim," said Sirius, eyeing James warily. "Let's get upstairs and get started on booking those wizards."</p><p>"Yeah," muttered James, the trembling in his hands slowly dissipating; perhaps routine work would calm his racing heart and desperate need to send Hermione a message, to tell her Dearborn was pointing his wand at her. "Sure."</p><hr /><p>They had been working close to six hours, bleary-eyed, and finishing up the last of their questioning of Moody's haul. Sirius and James were not the only Aurors there – a few of the night shift Aurors were, including a few cadets who often were stuck with the worst shifts – as Rufus Scrimgeour and Amelia Bones were also in the office trying to work a case. Everyone stopped what they were doing though, when Bartemius Crouch stormed into the Auror office.</p><p>His eyes were manic, wild, and his black hair – often slicked back – was in disarray, like he had just rolled out of bed. He clutched a sheaf of parchment in one hand. It was a look <em>none</em> of them had ever seen of their unflappable Department Head, and both James and Sirius froze at the eerie resemblance he had to his son at that moment.</p><p>"Sir…?" asked Rufus, rising slowly from his seat, palming his wand. At his side, Amelia was tense, eyes focused on their boss in case he was an imposter or under the Imperius.</p><p>"Bagnold's done it!"</p><p>Everyone stared, and Crouch looked around, the wildness of his expression slowly draining from his face, leaving only elation.</p><p>"She's signed the papers! We've been given <em>carte blanche</em> to use Unforgiveables against the terrorists!" he enthused. He even shook the parchment for emphasis. "We can fight back against those bastards with fire! They'll be wanted dead or alive!"</p><p>There were a few cheers, but James watched as Amelia and Rufus shared a concerned look, Amelia slowly sliding her wand back up her sleeve.</p><p>Crouch was practically skipping as he moved through the cubicles and aisles, stopping to speak with a few of the Aurors and tired cadets, and soon stopped by James and Sirius's shared desk.</p><p>He nodded at Sirius, but his smile was a bit more genuine when he looked at James, recognizing the husband of his son's best friend. "Potter. What brings you here, tonight? Don't you have a pregnant witch to go home to?"</p><p>"Moody was wounded in a skirmish earlier tonight," explained James, biting back a yawn. "We've been here since then processing the wizards."</p><p>Crouch had a knowing look in his eyes. "Booked for…?"</p><p>"Assault," answered Sirius succinctly, a vaguely innocent tilt to his chin.</p><p>Crouch snorted. "Fitting," he sneered. He fished in his waistcoat pocket and withdrew a small pocket watch attached to a chain, clicking it open, and reading the time inside. With a nod at them and their desks, he said, "Why don't you both go home and take a break? Come back when you're more awake?"</p><p>James and Sirius shared an uneasy look. "We haven't finished, sir…" James trailed off.</p><p>"You've been here, since what?" asked Crouch.</p><p>"Three," offered James.</p><p>"Three. And you've had how many coffees to stay awake?" continued the older man.</p><p>"Four," said Sirius with a sigh, "And we moved to Pepper-Up half an hour ago."</p><p>"Go. Home," urged Crouch, his voice hard. "You've done enough here tonight."</p><p>James couldn't bite back his yawn again and covered his mouth with his hand. "Yessir," he slurred, reaching for his jacket.</p><p>"Good lad," offered Crouch, patting James absently on the shoulder as he passed, to his office. Sirius made a face behind the man's back, mocking him by exaggerating his swagger and mouthing <em>good lad</em> at James.</p><p>"Shut up, Pads," laughed James, bumping his shoulder against his best friend's. "C'mon, let's go to the Alley. There's a bakery there and I can get breakfast before heading home. Might ease some of the Pepper-Up off, too."</p><p>"Gonna surprise Princess with a croissant?" teased Sirius.</p><p>James scowled.</p><hr /><p>Diagon Alley was empty when they apparated in at the early morning hour of five, with only a few businesses open. It was eerily still and quiet, but the baker in the bakery seemed pleased with the morning business, and James eagerly inhaled the scent of fresh-baked bread and mouth-watering pastries on display.</p><p>He was waiting for his bag, Sirius bent half over as he viewed the display cases and began a long process of figuring out what he wanted when someone outside the bakery caught his attention.</p><p>Fabian waved at James once more, then disappeared in the alley between the Prophet and a courtyard wall.</p><p>"I'll be a minute," muttered James, distractedly, toward Sirius.</p><p>"Jim…?"</p><p>But James already slipped out of the bakery, heading toward where he last saw Fabian, sliding into the alleyway.</p><p>The Prewett twin was leaning against the far wall, watching James as he approached. His hair was dishevelled, and there were the beginnings of a bruise along the length of his face, ranging up from his jaw to ear, where he had missed cleaning some blood up.</p><p>"What's going on?" asked James, in lieu of a greeting. He waved his hand at Fabian's ear. "By the way, you've got some…"</p><p>"What?" asked Fabian, then scowled as he tried rubbing at the dried blood. "Bugger." He sighed. "Anyway, that wasn't – well. What I mean –" he exhaled sharply; eyes closed. When he opened them, he said, quietly, "It's Hermione, isn't it?"</p><p>James swallowed, and then pursed his lips. "How'd you figure?"</p><p>Fabian shrugged, his hands deep in his pockets. "Seemed obvious. Dumbledore kept saying 'her', and well, after the rumours around her and her friends being kidnapped, and then what I saw in the forest—"</p><p>"Yeah, about that," interrupted James sharply, "What happened?"</p><p>"Oh, she didn't tell you?" asked Fabian, blinking. "Oh. Well. Uhh. Gid and I came across her, Black, her sister and sister's husband. Still don't know what they were doing in Little Hangleton, but we were caught by some Death Eaters. We fought together, and one of them, Wilkes, well… he died. Hermione held his hand when he, uh, passed."</p><p>"Shit," muttered James.</p><p>"Yeah," agreed Fabian, kicking a loose stone with the toe of his boot. "Listen – about what Dumbledore said—"</p><p>"You're not going to come down on his side, are you?" demanded James hotly.</p><p>"What? No!" Fabian shook his head. "Me an' Gid talked about it, after, you know? We all went to the pub after Wilkes' – well. We had a talk. And later, Gideon and I talked some more. I don't know what she and Black are up to—"</p><p>"And Crouch," added James, under his breath.</p><p>Fabian paused. "What, seriously?"</p><p>"Since Hogwarts," sighed James, running a hand through his hair and messing it up.</p><p>"<em>Since Hogwarts?</em>" repeated Fabian, flabbergasted. "What the fuck have they been doing?"</p><p>"Saving the world?" offered James wryly.</p><p>Fabian snorted. "Yeah, sounds right."</p><p>They were silent for a moment, then Fabian spoke again.</p><p>"Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that Gideon and I won't say anything," he finally said. He did peer at James, a bit worriedly. "She has a plan though, right?"</p><p>James stared. "She was a <em>Ravenclaw</em>, Prewett. 'Course she has a plan."</p><p>Fabian laughed, a bit weakly. "Well, just making sure. You know. With putting the fate of the entire wizarding world in her hands, and all."</p><p>James' mood instantly soured. "Yeah…"</p><p>"James?" Sirius' voice called.</p><p>Fabian swore and twisted on his heel, disappearing with a loud crack that bounced off the bricks on either side of James. He startled, whirling around to see Sirius standing by the mouth of the alley, peering at him intently, with two separate brown paper bags in either hand. He stood very still, something unreadable on his face when his grey eyes trailed down into the empty alleyway, having just missed seeing Fabian.</p><p>"Sirius." James breathed out in relief, and then his heart kicked up. "How long have you been there?"</p><p>Sirius sent him a rather unimpressed look. "How long do you think?"</p><p>Silence stretched between them.</p><p>Finally, Sirius asked, "Are you going to tell me what's going on?"</p><p>James licked his lips nervously. "If you heard enough, I don't need to tell you anything."</p><p>Sirius eyed him again, and James fought to shift awkwardly.</p><p>"I heard enough," he finally said – but James wasn't sure if he was confirming that he heard his discussion with Fabian about Hermione being the Chosen One, or if he heard enough from James on the topic and was willing to trust me.</p><p>As he left the alley, taking the paper bag Sirius silently offered, James wasn't sure which he hoped it was.</p><hr /><p>
  <strong>Late June, 1980</strong>
</p><p>Hermione went to the hospital without James and was loathe as he was to let her wander around London by herself, the fact that she was going to be at a muggle hospital was the only reason he didn't drag himself out of bed after her. (He didn't consider that Hermione would've stunned him unconscious if only to catch up on four hours of sleep to combat the dark bruises under his eyes and the wane, shallow pallor to his skin since Voldemort's attacks had increased the past fortnight.)</p><p>As it was, Hermione wandered into Petunia's room a few hours after Lily had already left, equally as tired as James but with lank hair and a desperate demeanour that Lily tried to brush off whenever Petunia asked, or so the eldest Evans sister said.</p><p>"It was as if she thought I didn't know a damn thing about your world," grumbled Petunia, sitting upright in her bed. She then widened her eyes, frantically looking to her son in Hermione's arms at her bedside. "I said 'damn', didn't I? Oh, what a terrible beginning—"</p><p>"He's literally two days old, Tuney," replied Hermione with a grin, "I think you've several years before he starts copying what you say."</p><p>Petunia rolled her eyes, fussing with the blankets around her. Hesitantly, she asked, "How… how bad is it going out there?"</p><p>Hermione frowned, passing Dermot Sean Bowes back to his mother, a finger lingering over his cheek as she did so, and he snuffled.</p><p>"Bad," she admitted quietly, moving to sit at the foot of the bed with difficulty, given her own large stomach. "Much worse than last time – half of the events that are happening never did previously."</p><p>Petunia bit her lip and looked at Hermione with large, pale blue eyes. "That's not good, is it?"</p><p>"My knowledge is pretty much used up at this point," replied Hermione, tracing a pattern on the bed, and keeping her face turned from Petunia's seeking gaze. "Everything from here on out is different."</p><p>"Surely not that different—"</p><p>"You named your son <em>Dudley</em>," laughed Hermione, glancing at Petunia.</p><p>She made a disgusted face. "<em>Dudley?</em>" she repeated, incredulously. "That's a terrible name – why would I—"</p><p>"Well, for one, you and Sean weren't together," said Hermione. "I imagine in the other timeline, you broke up or never got together."</p><p>Petunia's lips pursed. "Who did I…?"</p><p>"Do you really want to know?" challenged Hermione, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>"If I was going to torture my child with that name, <em>yes</em>," replied Petunia. She turned away briefly to coo at her son.</p><p>"…Vernon Dursley."</p><p>Petunia stared.</p><p>Sean walked in on that, looking between the two sisters, even as he carefully put down the teas he had in his hands on the nightstand at Petunia's bedside. "Erm, what did I interrupt?" He gave a weak joke: "Surely not another world-ending dark lord on the warpath…?"</p><p>"Dudley," bit out Petunia, still staring at Hermione in disbelief. "Hermione just told me that in her other time, I named my son <em>Dudley</em>."</p><p>Sean made a face. "Really? Erm, well—"</p><p>"Because I married <em>Vernon Dursley</em>," finished Petunia.</p><p>"Vernon Dursley?" echoed Sean, frowning. "Wait. Dursley – wasn't he that prick in your accounting class…?"</p><p>Petunia tersely nodded, and Sean sat in a nearby armchair, legs weak, breathing out a shaky, "Blimey…" He turned his eyes toward his sister-in-law and leaned forward the slightest. "Have to say, Hermione, I think I much prefer <em>this</em> timeline."</p><p>The corners of Hermione's eyes crinkled as she turned her eyes from Sean back to Petunia, looking down at her nephew, and she murmured, "Me too, Sean. Me too."</p><p>"Right-o, where's James, then?" asked Sean after a few moments of both him and Petunia making faces at their son, who was ignoring them.</p><p>"Sleeping," sighed Hermione. "They're completely run ragged – he's upped his attacks and it's a daily occurrence now. There's was a skirmish a few weeks past in Aberdeen—"</p><p>Sean made a face. "The terrorist attack near Balmoral?"</p><p>Hermione nodded. "James fought him again – that's three times."</p><p>Fear coated Hermione's voice, and she thought back to Trelawney's original prophecy. Petunia, who knew about it, seemed to follow Hermione's train of thought, and sniffed, "Surely that doesn't matter now, Hermione."</p><p>"What doesn't?" asked Sean.</p><p>"The prophecy," said Petunia, for him, although he looked utterly bewildered and muttered, "There's a prophecy involved now?"</p><p>"Originally, it was about James and Lily's Harry – born to those who thrice defied him," elaborated Hermione quietly. "With James having met Riddle in a wand fight now, three times, and walking away, he technically meets his requirements of the prophecy."</p><p>"But you don't," Petunia was quick to point out. "You've only defied him once – when you were kidnapped."</p><p>Sean shook his head. "I think we could technically count her destroying the Horcruxes as defiance as well. She's been 'defying' him, working against, for far longer. Hermione could well be past three."</p><p>Petunia paled, eyes wide and she reached out to grab at Hermione's hand on her bedcovers. "You'll be careful, won't you? Say you will, Hermione."</p><p>"I'm as careful as I can be when there's a civil war going on," she murmured in reply, using her other hand to place on top of Petunia's where it gripped her tightly.</p><p>"Shame no one got a potshot in on him," sighed Sean, although the crease between his eyebrows and the worry lines stretching from his eyes belayed his concern for her. "Since he's mortal, now."</p><p>"Yes," agreed Hermione, frowning and thinking back at James' rants of the Aberdeen attack – at how the Prewett twins had tried so hard to make it toward Riddle, at how Moody took out four Death Eaters, and how James had gone toe-to-toe with Riddle for as long as he had the opportunities to do so, desperately trying to kill the man, only for Dearborn to interrupt at the last second when he could've got lucky…</p><p>"Yes, what a shame."</p><hr /><p>They stole whatever moments they could, keeping calm in the eye of the storm that summer.</p><p>When lying in bed, Hermione propped up by pillows and dozing lightly, James would rest on his side, face near her extended belly, and count each breath she took, each rise and fall of her chest. He would press his hand, hot, against her belly and delight in the press back, whether it was a hand or foot, or once, he was sure, a head, and whisper promises and vows.</p><p>
  <em>I love you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I won't let anything happen to you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I will stop this war, so you don't have to fight it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You won't be alone, ever.</em>
</p><p><em>I'll build you a better world to grow up in</em>.</p><p>James wasn't sure if they would come true, but he died once before for his son and wife; he was willing to do it again. It was more than just resolve that firmed this decision – if it came down to it, it was something in his very being.</p><p>It was something he didn't think of often, his own mortality, but it was something that came up more and more the longer the war went on and the more friends they lost in the Order. He struggled, initially, with Hermione's ideas of doing whatever was necessary to win – but then again, she wasn't ever on the frontline like he was, working more behind the scenes with Crouch and Regulus to destroy the Horcruxes and succeeding. But that didn't mean he didn't see the benefits of being a bit more aggressive, a bit more decisive in their tactics. To use whatever tools were necessary to win.</p><p>He was James Potter, son of Charlus and Dorea. He was married to Hermione Evans, a time-travelling, and they were about to have their son. He was Sirius's brother in all but blood. He was best friends with Remus and Peter. He was a Gryffindor, and Gryffindors go where others dare not to tread.</p><p>He would do anything for his family, even die for them if he had to, so that they could live.</p><p><em>After all,</em> he thought, as his fingers danced over the silky-smooth fabric of his Potter invisibility cloak, which Hermione had told him all about. <em>Potters – and Peverells – aren't afraid of death.</em></p><hr /><p>
  <strong>Late July, 1980</strong>
</p><p>Near the end of July, and Hermione's due date, Petunia invited her youngest sister out for a tea and catch up, giving James a blistering over the telephone, complaining that she hadn't seen her sister in over a month, and she wanted to see her, as did her month-old son.</p><p>James, skeptically, handed the phone to Hermione and sensibility retreated, until Hermione waddled into their receiving room, a light jacket thrown over her arm.</p><p>"You're not going, are you?" he asked, although it was entirely rhetorical.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. "Yes, I am."</p><p>"No, you're not," retorted James, rising from his seat.</p><p>Hermione stopped, slowly turning on her heels to stare at her husband.</p><p>"Hermione, you're near your due date," he tried. "Be sensible. It's a risk of being out and not close to the Floo for emergencies. What if your water breaks when you're out?"</p><p>"Then I'll go to a muggle hospital," she answered easily.</p><p>"Muggle?" James' nose wrinkled.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes <em>again</em>. "Yes, James, a muggle hospital, because I'm meeting Petunia at a muggle café, literally two streets over because she knows I can't be too far from home."</p><p>James worked his jaw back and forth a bit in consideration. "Is it just you two?"</p><p>"Tuney said she asked Lily if she wanted to come, and she said she is," answered Hermione. "And she's just as huge as I am."</p><p>"Fine," grumbled James. "A few streets over, year? Near the Crouches?"</p><p>"Thereabouts."</p><p>"Go to theirs if something happens, please," he requested, trying to be as polite as possible. "I can get there easily and to St. Mungo's then. I'll know where you are."</p><p>Slowly, Hermione nodded, her eyes softening. She stepped forward and cupped his jaw. "I'll be fine, James."</p><p>He released a shaky breath, leaning into her touch. "I know, Hermione – it's just… I worry."</p><p>"I know. And I love you for it," she replied, smiling at him. She pressed her lips against his, and James sagged the tiniest into her, curling an arm around her back even as her stomach made it difficult to reach her for a thorough snog.</p><p>He grumbled against her lips, "Can't wait for this one to be out so I can bend you back and kiss you properly."</p><p>Hermione laughed against his mouth and drew back, wiping at his lips. "Goodbye, James."</p><p>His brow furrowed, thinking there was something in her tone or her voice, despite the laughter in her eyes and the up curl to her lips. But by the time he called after her, "Hermione?" the front door had snapped shut.</p><p>He sighed, throwing himself back into his chair, brooding. He barely had twenty minutes of staring at the wall when Dumbledore's Patronus burst into the receiving room, startling him enough that James flailed and fell off the chair.</p><p>"What—"</p><p>"Full meeting. Now. Dorset house." Dumbledore's tone was clipped and stressed.</p><p>Confused, James rose to his feet, even as the patronus disappeared in a flurry of sparkles, not remaining for confirmation. Whatever was happening, it was serious.</p><p>He swallowed, eyes darting to the front door. He had enough time that maybe he could catch up with Hermione, bustle her back into the house to safety, but… instead, he turned to the front closet, grabbed the dragonhide jacket Hermione gifted him years ago, and shrugged it on, with something like grim determination settling on him as the cool dragonhide settled on his shoulders.</p><p>In the apparition room, James spun on his heel and left the safety and security of their townhouse and arrived just outside the low stone wall at the Order's Dorset house, nearly on top of Peter as he arrived, sickly-looking with a pinched look on his face.</p><p>James eyed him. "Alright there, Wormtail?"</p><p>Peter jumped, spinning to face James. "James! I didn't see you there."</p><p>"Yeah, we popped in at the same time," he offered, beginning to walk forward and through the gate, Peter on his heels. "Wasn't surprised you didn't hear me apparate in."</p><p>"Any idea what this is about?" asked Peter as they trudged up the gravel path.</p><p>"No," replied James, glancing at him. "And Dumbledore and I haven't been talking much recently, either."</p><p>Peter looked surprised at that, mouth a bit open. "Really? But I thought—"</p><p>"Did you hear anything?" interrupted James, not interested in getting into it about his unhappiness with the Order's leader.</p><p>Peter slowly shook his head.</p><p>They reached the door, and James opened it. He was blasted with noise immediately, a sound barrier keeping the noise from breaching the windows. The spell was powerful, and it washed over him as he stepped inside; whatever would be shared was going to be very important.</p><p>It was a full house; the back sitting room was full, and the kitchen magically expanded with the wall between them blown out and held up only by magic. Members who had never met each other met for the first time, their eyes nervously glancing around and their shoulders tight with tension.</p><p>Peter kept to James, even as he weaved through the room until he found the Prewett's. "What's going on?" he asked as he approached.</p><p>Gideon shook his head. "Dunno."</p><p>"We just got here, ourselves," added Fabian.</p><p>James' mouth flattened into a tight line, and he gave a sharp nod. He settled against the wall with them, ignoring Peter's fidgeting hands.</p><p>Sirius and Remus – looking wane and sickly – appeared a bit later, from two different directions, and made their way over, despite Sirius's cautious glance toward their werewolf friend.</p><p>Gideon gave a nod in greeting; none were in the mood to speak.</p><p>Sirius gripped James' shoulder though, catching his eyes. <em>Alright?</em> He seemed to ask.</p><p>James nodded once, giving Sirius a tight smile. <em>Alright</em>.</p><p>"Can I get your attention, please?" called Dumbledore, his voice magically aided to reach all the corners of the rooms.</p><p>People quieted down and turned their faces toward him.</p><p>He was grim, wearing subdued, almost black, robes without any embellishments on them. They were streamlined, a tighter cut, and James felt a frisson of worry race up his spine as he realized that whatever was happening, they were heading out somewhere, and Dumbledore was going with them to fight.</p><p>Moody, wearing an eyepatch, was on Dumbledore's left, and Dearborn was on his right, wearing his usual scowl, arms crossed.</p><p>"We've received intelligence from two separate spies that Voldemort has lost something important," began Dumbledore.</p><p>James froze, catching his breath.</p><p>"What did he lose?" called one member.</p><p>"His sanity?" suggested another dryly, causing a few nervous laughs.</p><p>Dumbledore gave a gentle smile. "Perhaps," he offered, nodding in the direction of the joke, "But whatever these items were, they were important to him. He hit Gringott's early this morning, in full view of any Diagon Alley shoppers, and left quite a number of casualties behind, witches and wizards and goblins, alike."</p><p>That sobered the room.</p><p>"Why haven't we heard of this?" asked Frank.</p><p>"I wasn't in the office, so I wasn't there," said Fabian, their Gringott's curse breaker, with a shrug, despite his very pale face. It made the freckles stand out.</p><p>"I was in Diagon Alley this morning," offered a quiet voice, a familiar one. James's hair at the nape of his neck stood up as Lily shuffled forward, her hands resting on her stomach. She was pale, eyes wide when she spoke. "I was the one who brought it to Professor Dumbledore's attention. I only got out… got out… because…"</p><p>She stifled a sob.</p><p>Alice, nearby, stepped forward and wrapped an arm around Lily, cuddling her close as she broke down.</p><p>Fear gripped James and without conscious thought, he was moving forward toward his sister-in-law. "Were you alone?" he asked.</p><p>Lily looked up, blinking back tears on her lashes.</p><p>He demanded, again, "Were you alone? Lily! Were you in Diagon alone? Hermione said she was meeting you—"</p><p>Lily shook her head. "I was in Diagon <em>before</em> – I used the Knight Bus to meet them but stopped there first, so I never saw Tuney and Mione—"</p><p>James let out a breath of relief, slumping back.</p><p>"Are you done, Potter?" asked Dearborn roughly.</p><p>"Oi, watch it!" snapped Sirius, ever loyal.</p><p>"That's enough," said Dumbledore sharply, calling the attention back to him. "What matters is this information. With these important items missing or destroyed, Voldemort has retreated to the safety of his follower's homes. Our spies have indicated that he has recalled all his supporters to Lestrange Manor."</p><p>Murmurs broke out.</p><p>"Lestrange Manor is a fortress," Fabian said. "How are we supposed to attack it, let alone survive the first assault to make it inside?"</p><p>"Our spy on the inside will break the ward scheme to get us in," replied Moody.</p><p>"Blimey," said Frank, sitting back in his chair in shock. "Who's the spy that they can do that?"</p><p>"That's not important," interrupted Moody, even as Dearborn's mouth opened. "What's important is that you all know we're leaving in twenty minutes."</p><p>It was like all the air was sucked out of the room.</p><p>"Twenty minutes?" whispered someone fearfully.</p><p>"This is it," confirmed Dumbledore with a short nod. "This is our opportunity."</p><p>James shared a glance with Fabian and Gideon. With a prophecy in play – one Dumbledore knew about – even if they managed to capture every single supporter of Voldemort's, Dumbledore was going to do nothing about the wizard himself. He'd want Hermione to do it – but James knew he was mortal. <em>Anyone </em>could end the war by killing the Dark Lord.</p><p>"Make your final arrangements," offered Dumbledore, his voice kind if not grim. "We will be leaving shortly. Our final fight begins."</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC...</p>

  <p align="center">Yesterday is Tomorrow (Everything is Connected)</p><p align="center">TWENTY-SEVEN</p><hr /><p><strong>Jennifer Goines</strong>: Today is the day. One that ends at the beginning and begins at the end.</p><p>– <em>12 Monkeys</em> (TV show)</p><hr /><p>The changes Hermione made on the timeline made her uneasy.</p><p>It was hard, to academically realize that her presence and knowledge from an alternate timeline had benefited and altered <em>this</em> timeline she was living in – to acknowledging that she no longer had useful information and was merely another participant.</p><p>Voldemort's Horcruxes were gone, thanks to her, Barty, and Regulus; and Voldemort did not know. However, with them having spent most of their time during and post-Hogwarts fighting the war covertly, they had left the resistance to Dumbledore's Order of the Pheonix, and they were struggling, even with James' additional knowledge.</p><p>Hermione had managed to stave off Fabian and Gideon's deaths but that was it: Lily's best friend Marlene had died regardless – as Hermione knew nothing about her original death other than Voldemort had done it directly – and the Bones' were attacked and killed. Far more people were dying in this timeline, earlier on, than they had originally because of a ripple effect of her existence.</p><p>It was horrifying to think.</p><p>It also made her wonder if the timeline was trying to reset itself, snapping back into place. A prophecy for a prophecy; a new Chosen One against this Dark Lord. So long as the Deathly Hallows remained far, far away from her, Hermione thought she could manage to squeak through.</p><p>Despite it all, every time James left the townhouse, Hermione wondered if something was going to happen to him. Every part of her itched to leave the house as well, to go and fight; even when badly injured and suffering from the aftereffects of torture under Bellatrix's wand, Hermione had rested only a few days and then gone with Harry and Ron to Gringott's and then Hogwarts for the final battle. Sitting around, trying to be a good housewife, was infuriating.</p><p>She <em>was</em> housebound, though. James fussed over her constantly, and Dorea would apparate over unannounced "because she was in the area." The one time she had done that, and Hermione had been out grocery shopping, Dorea had panicked and sent James into a tailspin panic as well, resulting in a very confused Hermione arriving home to all the Potters, Sirius, Regulus, Barty, Remus, and Peter working together to figure out where she had gone.</p><p>It was the only time she had seen all of them working together without arguments, and it had been so bizarre she didn't want to experience it again. It did mean she was home most of the time, but it <em>did</em> give her the peace and quiet to make her plans for stopping Voldemort, once and for all.</p><p>Those were slow going, though. There were too many variables in place to accurately come up with the best means of attack (and despite a voice that sounded distinctly Harry-like piping up in her ear shouting, "attack!" – that was far too Gryffindor and like him, to be effective), leaving Hermione in an awkward phase of 'hurry up and wait.'</p><p>Which meant she was bored out of her mind…</p><p>…so, Barty Crouch, Jr. to the rescue!</p><p>Her fellow Ravenclaw and best friend sprung her from the townhouse, as part of James' approved companionship and whisked her back to his family townhome a few streets over. Iris was ecstatic to see Hermione and gushed over her as she had Winky set out tea, leaving Barty staring aimlessly out of the nearby window until talk of babies was done.</p><p>Conversation flowed to other benign topics, until Iris asked, "And how is James doing, Hermione? My Barty has been pulling such awful hours lately…"</p><p>"Same," replied Hermione, putting her teacup down, keeping an eye on Barty as he eyed her last two macarons. "Although that's more to do with being understaffed and overworked due to the situation at hand than top-down governance, especially with the recent attack in Beasts—"</p><p>She broke off as Wallace Crouch entered the sitting room, a charming grin on his face. "I hope I'm not interrupting, Iris."</p><p>"Wally!" Barty's mother beamed up at her brother-in-law. "Not at all – Winky—"</p><p>Winky, being the clever house-elf she was, had already set out another teacup, saucer and plate, and Wallace gratefully sank into the couch cushions next to Iris, unbuttoning his blazer/robe combination that wizard fashion was.</p><p>"You look nice," continued Iris cheerfully, pouring the tea with a tap of her wand to make the teacup hover.</p><p>He snorted. "Thank you, Iris, but you can say that I look tired."</p><p>"Not as much as Father," muttered Barty around a stolen macaron. Hermione sent him a glare.</p><p>"True," conceded Wallace, leaning back with a sigh. There was close to fifteen years between Bartemius Crouch and Wallace Crouch, but they both had thick dark hair and a sharp face – something Barty had inherited. On Wallace, it made Hermione nervous. "But I've been in constant Floo calls with the ICW back in New York, and the time difference can be annoying to work around."</p><p>"Oh?" asked Hermione politely, and Barty added, catching on to Hermione's thoughts, "We've heard that the ICW might finally be stepping in with the current, ah, Dark Lord problem Britain has. Like they did with Grindelwald."</p><p>Wallace nodded at them. "The ICW wants to, but we're being blocked by the British Ministry – Bagnold's office is giving us the runaround."</p><p>Hermione murmured some nonsense noise that sounded like sympathy to keep Wallace speaking.</p><p>"Bagnold wants to keep it contained as a 'Britain-only' problem," expanded Wallace on the topic, voice vaguely bitter. "And since the Dark Lord hasn't made a move <em>outside</em> of Britain, the ICW has no cause or justification to go after him."</p><p>"Yet," said Barty, glaring down at his empty plate of snacks.</p><p>"The ICW only got involved with Grindelwald because he was appearing and recruiting in many different countries," explained Wallace. "He was threatening the Statute of Secrecy with his actions – <em>this</em> one has not."</p><p>Hermione stared. "I'm surprised that the ICW, then, has taken an interest. They're just a body of allied magical nations that uphold the Statute, are they not?"</p><p>Wallace hummed. "Yes and no. They <em>do</em> uphold the Statute to stop non-magicals from learning about magic and thus creating another witch hunt, <em>but</em> the ICW does have their own witches and wizards capable of – ah, let's say – cleaning up messes when certain messes get too large for individual containment."</p><p><em>In other words</em>, thought Hermione, <em>the ICW wanted to step in and nip the Voldemort problem in the bud before it exploded in Britain's face</em>. It was odd, to her though, because, in her original timeline, the ICW had not intervened when Voldemort returned in her fourth year; in fact, after that, they seemed to take a hand's off approach and even removed Dumbledore from his appointment on the ICW.</p><p>What had changed?</p><p>She narrowed her eyes as Barty and Wallace spoke further, listening carefully but all the while the worry and niggling sensation that she was missing something important kept her from fully involving herself in the topic.</p><p>"… so, I'm really sticking around until Bagnold gets tired of me," finished Wallace with a sigh, even if it was belied by the smug smirk he wore. "I'll find an in with the Minister's office, just watch. I'll keep lobbying for our intervention – my bosses gave me all the time I want or need to accomplish this."</p><p>"Just lobby their intervention?" asked Hermione.</p><p>"Well…" Wallace hedged, shifting a bit on the couch. "There are also a few wizards that we think are working for the British Dark Lord – Antonin Dolohov, for one – and let's just say that there are a few ICW nations in Eastern Europe who have a keen interest in retrieving this wizard alive to stand trial."</p><p>As he finished, his large silver watch chirped at him, and he startled. "Ah, my apologies, Iris, nephew, Mrs. Potter. It's almost time for Bagnold to return from her lunch, and I'd like to waylay her on her return to the office."</p><p>He stood, bowing in Iris' direction and then Hermione's.</p><p>"I'll show you out, Wally," offered Iris, standing and joining her brother-in-law.</p><p>Once they had left, Hermione frowned.</p><p>"What?" asked Barty, glancing at her.</p><p>"Do you trust him?"</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"Your uncle, Wallace." Hermione stared in the direction they had left, a furrow between her eyebrows.</p><p>Barty's eyebrows mimicked hers as he settled into a frown. "Should I not? What's he like in the future?"</p><p>Hermione's frown deepened. "That's the thing, Barty." She turned and looked at him, concern on her face. "He never existed in my time."</p><p>Barty blinked, shock passing over his face, which quickly turned thunderous as he stared after the man, despite the lack of him in the parlour door.</p><p>"Then…" trailed off Barty, voice low, "Then… I don't know, Hermione. I… <em>really</em> don't know who we can trust anymore."</p><hr /><p>With the increased risks in visiting the magical world, due to the attacks, Hermione kept to the non-magical side as much as possible, doing her grocery shopping there, and when living in the townhouse became too much (and the heavy weight of carrying around her baby was frustrating at her due date loomed), she would visit the nearby café for a few moments of respite.</p><p>On that one, sunny July day, Hermione met Barty and Regulus at an outdoor café she enjoyed, oversized sunglasses perched on her nose and an herbal tea set before her. She had a mild notice-me-not and <em>muffliato </em>spell up as soon as both Barty and Regulus appeared, taking their seats with Barty in the full sun, while Hermione and Regulus had their backs to the café front and the shaded umbrella.</p><p>"You're huge," said Regulus, staring at Hermione the moment he sat.</p><p>"Thanks," replied Hermione dryly. "You're so kind. A real charmer. Those pureblood manners training you had <em>really</em> paid off."</p><p>"Explains why Calypso never looked at him twice," agreed Barty with a hint of a wicked glint in his brown eyes.</p><p>"Shut up," muttered Regulus.</p><p>The trio fell into silence as Barty and Regulus waited for their drinks – and a muffin for Barty – and then, once their items had arrived, Regulus said, while stirring his tea and tapping the spoon on the rim of the saucer, "You know you won't be able to fight him in your condition."</p><p>Barty froze, muffin hovering just in front of his mouth, eyes darting between Hermione and Regulus.</p><p>"I know," scowled Hermione, a mulish pout on her lips.</p><p>Regulus' look hardened. "You <em>can't</em>, Hermione."</p><p>"I <em>know</em>," she repeated. "I know I'm a liability in my current condition."</p><p>"Not to mention that your magic is going to be all over the place," added Barty carefully. "It's well documented—"</p><p>"Yes, I've read those pamphlets, too, Barty!" snapped Hermione irritably. In response, Barty shoved the muffin in his mouth and took a large bite, chewing it carefully to prolongate not speaking. "Dorea was <em>insistent</em>."</p><p>Regulus cleared his throat. "Well then… shall we discuss what our next steps are?"</p><p>"Here?" asked Barty, swallowing loudly, and then looking around at the café. Although not busy, there were several patrons enjoying the balmy weather and many others walking nearby down the laneway.</p><p>"It's the only time I get outside," muttered Hermione. "And no one can hear us, anyway."</p><p>Regulus sighed. "Fine. With all of – <em>his</em> – Horcruxes gone, he's mortal. <em>Anyone</em> can kill him now."</p><p>"Except for whatever that prophecy says," interrupted Barty.</p><p>Hermione's scowl deepened and she slurped at her tea to bite back the words she wanted to say about it.</p><p>"I still can't believe Dumbledore and Dearborn are so set on it," continued Barty. "Dearborn didn't seem so bad when we met at Malfoy Manor—"</p><p>"He had been a guest of <em>his</em> for several months and had clearly been tortured," said Regulus baldly. "He didn't come by those burn scars naturally, Barty. That's enough to make anyone reconsider being well-adjusted."</p><p>Barty mumbled something under his breath.</p><p>"Whatever Dearborn is or isn't like," said Hermione, "The truth is both he and Dumbledore are aware of the full contents of the prophecy and think it's me. So, they're expecting me to finish the job."</p><p>"<em>Is</em> it you?" asked Regulus skeptically. "You didn't tell us—"</p><p>Hermione repeated the prophecy that James had been told, in a bland, monotonous tone. "<em>An unspeakable evil shrouds the land. Yet by balancing the scales of existence, hope shall be restored when chains are broken, through magic never before seen. What was once yesterday is tomorrow and tomorrow is today… For when the clock rewinds, everything is connected…</em>"</p><p>"You're the restored hope, I assume," said Regulus, finally after a few minutes of shocked silence, as he and Barty digested the prophecy.</p><p>"And the magic never before seen – I guess that's your wandless abilities," added Barty.</p><p>Regulus sighed. "And the clock rewinding…"</p><p>"If you know the truth about me, then, yes, it's very clear," answered Hermione. "But it doesn't say <em>I</em> have to be the one to kill Riddle. Just that I create the optimal situation for it. And even still – it doesn't offer a clear message of good triumphing over evil."</p><p>"True," agreed Regulus, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>"So…" Barty looked at both Hermione and Regulus. He nervously ripped apart his muffin and threw a piece into his mouth. "Who's gonna do it then?"</p><p>"Do what?"</p><p>"Kill the bastard," he explained. "And whichever of us does it – because let's be honest, Hermione, it's not going to be you – how are we going to get away with it?"</p><p>"Well, if you do it, Barty, your dad can get you off since he's Head of the Aurors," said Regulus dryly.</p><p>"Your father will lobby for your freedom," argued Barty.</p><p>"Except Regulus happens to have at least <em>one</em> very vocal cousin who is part of Riddle's inner circle," argued Hermione. "Because of Bellatrix, he'll have a harder time selling that he did the world a favour."</p><p>"And Dumbledore might not like it," sighed Regulus.</p><p>"Which leaves only one of us," finished Hermione, eyeing Barty carefully. "D'you think you can do it?"</p><p>"Yeah, 'course!" Barty nodded his head vigorously.</p><p>Both Hermione and Regulus stared at him.</p><p>"What?" he asked, popping the last of his muffin in his mouth.</p><p>"You're going to be fine with using an Unforgiveable?" asked Regulus skeptically. "Standing in front of him and casting the Killing Curse?"</p><p>"I didn't say that!" Barty blinked. "I can just as easily use a severing charm or aim a blasting curse at his head."</p><p>"I doubt anyone of us would be just <em>walking up to him</em>," stressed Hermione. "Not only would he see you coming a mile away, but that's entirely stupid."</p><p>"Oh, what would you suggest, o wise one?" asked Regulus, a slight scathing tone to his voice.</p><p>"Find a better place to do the deed," she replied instantly. "With cover. He's still incredibly powerful, Reg. His temper can be his downfall. Goad him, get him angry. Use the geography of the location to our advantage and his disadvantage."</p><p>"Like a warehouse or neighbourhood," said Barty, ideas dawning on him.</p><p>Hermione grimaced. "Let's not do a neighbourhood – we don't want anyone getting hurt that doesn't have to."</p><p>"That really does limit places," sighed Regulus. "Any Pureblood home, or out in the middle of nowhere, really."</p><p>Hermione frowned. "Forest of Dean?"</p><p>"I suppose…" Regulus sighed again, deeper.</p><p>"Well, it's not like some pureblood is going to turn over their ancestral house for us to destroy," laughed Barty. He eyed Regulus. "Got any to spare?"</p><p>Regulus scowled.</p><p>"We'll need everyone's help," added Hermione, fiddling with her tea, shifting in her seat. "Like baby Lestrange and Malfoy."</p><p>"Ugh," Barty made a face. "Must we?"</p><p>"I think we can put aside our differences when the world is about to end," drawled Regulus, censure in his tone.</p><p>Barty crossed his arms and settled into a mulish silence.</p><p>Hermione sighed. "I think we have the good working of a plan here – we'll see with Baby Lestrange, or Malfoy, would be interested in passing information to Riddle from us. Nothing about the Horcruxes, perhaps, because we don't want him going off and making more, but perhaps about the prophecy and where I might be at a given day and time."</p><p>"You think he'll want to kill you that badly?" asked Regulus, worried.</p><p>Hermione nodded slowly. "He was when there was a prophecy about Harry. He heard it and acted within two years."</p><p>Regulus and Barty shared a look; Barty bit his lip and looked back at Hermione. "Are you <em>sure</em> you want to do this?"</p><p>She scowled. "This isn't a matter of <em>want</em>, Barty. I don't have a choice."</p><p>"You can sit this out, Hermione," said Regulus, trying to gentle his voice. "You're about to give birth. Nothing needs to be decided yet."</p><p>"If we don't act soon…" she trailed off and ran a frustrated hand through her tangled curls, bringing stray hairs with her as she lowered her hand. She idly picked the hair strands out. "We'll lose him. More will die, and that's blood on our hands if we wait. I can't do that."</p><p>"Let's give it a few days more," urged Regulus, eyeing her and her stomach. "A month, maybe two. The baby is due in July, right? That's soon. We can wait three months, Hermione."</p><p>"Can we?" she replied quietly, staring at him.</p><p>"I'd pick you over the world any day," he replied, just as quietly.</p><p>Tears immediately welled in her eyes, and she sniffed.</p><p>"We love you, too, Hermione," said Barty cheerfully.</p><p>She scoffed, still sniffly and teary. "What are you talking about, Crouch? These are pregnancy hormones. That's all."</p><p>Through her teary eyes, she saw Regulus and Barty share an amused look, and then they were on either side of her, their arms stretched out and she was sandwiched between them, warm and comfortable.</p><p>They sat together for a long time until the baby – Harry, that prat – pressed on her bladder and she shoved at them, snapping, "Okay, move – I need to pee."</p><p>They laughed, and everything was right.</p><hr /><p>Near the end of July, James walked into their townhouse and presented Hermione was three buttery croissants from a bakery in Diagon Alley just as she woke up. The smell was enticing, and Hermione peered suspiciously at James and his sweet-as-sugar lopsided smile when she asked, "What are these for?"</p><p>"Can't I just spoil my lovely, pregnant wife? The light of my life? The most brilliant woman that I know? The fairest of—"</p><p>Hermione snorted and snatched the paper bag. "Flattery, Mr. Potter, will definitely get you somewhere when my stomach is involved."</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>She opened the bag, rummaged through it for a pastry, and withdrew the still warm piece. Shoving it in her mouth, she moaned and mumbled, "Thought you were going to be at work a bit longer?"</p><p>"I was," agreed James, "But Crouch came swaggering in and told Sirius and me to go home."</p><p>"Crouch? Swaggering?" echoed Hermione in confusion, swallowing. "When's that man ever in a good mood?"</p><p>"Dunno, but last night he sure as hell was," replied James. He reached for one of the croissants and began to idly pick it apart. "He finally got emergency power last night."</p><p>Hermione's head jerked up. "Aurors can cast Unforgiveables now?"</p><p>James nodded, jaw ticking.</p><p>Her chewing slowed, although it was still thoughtful. "Huh."</p><p>"Happened last time, I'm guessing?" James' voice was wry.</p><p>"Yes…" Hermione trailed off. Her eyes suddenly snapped to him. "You're not pleased."</p><p>"I don't know how I feel," he answered quietly.</p><p>Hermione waited for James to continue speaking, even as he idly played with the food.</p><p>"Sirius accused me of going dark," he finally blurted.</p><p>Hermione's eyes widened. "<em>What</em>?"</p><p>"Well, not quite, but uh, kind of?" James winced. "He told me I shouldn't become the thing that we're fighting."</p><p>Hermione made a noise in her throat and James continued.</p><p>"He… he just said I was unaffected," mumbled James, looking down, wane. "That I killed two Death Eaters like it didn't bother me. But <em>it did</em>, Hermione. It did, of course, it did. But at the same time – if we arrested them, then what? They'd have been out within a week, hurting others."</p><p>"So, you put them down first," she sighed.</p><p>He nodded glumly. "And Sirius thinks I'll start casting dark magic as the next step in my downward spiral toward amorality."</p><p>"Are you?" asked Hermione, eyeing him.</p><p>"What? Gonna start using dark magic?" James stared at his wife incredulously. Shock rippled across his face when she said nothing, just stared levelly at him. "What? No! Merlin, <em>no</em>."</p><p>"There were times we thought about it," said Hermione quietly, after some time of silence. "When we were in the tent, and it seemed like all hope was lost. We wondered if we pushed ourselves a bit more; if we did a little more… would it have made a difference?"</p><p>"What did you decide?" asked James – who, despite being told about her previous life, did not have nitty-gritty details of conversations.</p><p>Hermione shrugged. "Harry didn't want to cross that line. If he did, I would have been right beside him, I'm sure. Ron would've, too, I think, eventually. But he… for all that he could be spiteful, Harry never crossed it, except once."</p><p>"Once?"</p><p>"When Sirius died."</p><p>James' heart stuttered and his breath hitched. He knew Sirius had died; he knew – but it still hurt.</p><p>"Bellatrix killed him in front of Harry," she explained. "I only heard about this after the fact, as I was already unconscious at the time—" absently, her hand reached up to her sternum and drew a line diagonally between her breasts and over her extended stomach. "—but Neville told me. He chased after her and cast <em>crucio</em>."</p><p>James blinked. "He did <em>what</em>?"</p><p>Fury rose in him at his son, thinking to cast an Unforgiveable on someone, even in response to Sirius' death. For a moment, blind parental fear warred with shock and concern over the actions his son from another timeline did, and then he blinked and realized he was getting worked up over something he would never experience. He did make a mental note to ensure that <em>his</em> child with Hermione knew better, though.</p><p>"It didn't land," explained Hermione, eyeing James knowingly. His ears turned red. "Knocked her off her feet, but she was laughing. Oh, we all used <em>imperio</em> during the war, that year on the run, but anything worse? No. Harry wouldn't kill his opponents if he didn't have to." She sighed, again. "Sometimes, things would've been easier if we had, I think."</p><p>"Then what is the right thing to do?" asked James. "Do I keep killing my opponents, or do I let them go to hurt someone else? If I do that, and they hurt or kill someone, is that on me? If I can <em>stop</em> them, and I don't – is it my fault?"</p><p>"Would you feel guilty if that happens?" asked Hermione curiously. "If you say, fail to stop Bellatrix one day and she goes on to murder a family the next. Would you feel guilty that you could have done more?"</p><p>James answered without hesitation. "Yes."</p><p>"Then you have your answer."</p><p>He made a face and Hermione laughed, loud. "If you can live with the decision you make to stop someone from hurting another – someone <em>you know will do much worse</em> to someone else – then you aren't going dark, James. You're doing what you think is right and you should stick to that."</p><p>He let that digest, roll around his brain for a bit. Then, he asked quietly, "Would you upset with me, if I killed?"</p><p>Hermione's answer was all teeth. "Darling, I'd be right there at your side, helping you hide the bodies. I've stood beside a Potter from the beginning – I don't plan on stopping that anytime soon."</p><hr /><p>It took some finagling, but between Petunia and Hermione's phone calls, and Hermione and Lily's owls and floo calls, they managed to find a date that would work for them to meet up in Muggle London in late July. It was pushing close to Hermione and Lily's due dates – uncomfortably close – but with the knowledge hanging over Hermione that her plans with Barty and Regulus were close to being put in motion and that the war would come to an end soon (or ramp up), there would be little time to see her sisters.</p><p>Petunia, of course, immediately agreed, as she was more in the know than Lily. She seemed to sense that something was hanging over Hermione and correctly guessed it had to do with the war – and with the prophecy, as well as Barty and Regulus's sombre moods whenever she saw them, or James' tired, shallow expression – and it ending on Hermione's say-so.</p><p>Petunia was already seated at the restaurant, with her son in a carrier at her side at the table, cooing over the baby, when Hermione arrived for lunch. She waddled over and waved Petunia off from standing to greet her sister, instead sitting in a huff.</p><p>"I can't <em>wait</em> for this one to be out," she sighed. She made a tiny wince of pain as her lower back spasmed and the muscles twitched.</p><p>"You'll rethink that after you start pulling all-nighters or your baby has colic," said Petunia sagely, as if she had birthed hundreds of babies instead of being a new mum herself.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes and picked up the menu, looking it over. "When's Lily arriving?"</p><p>"She's got twenty more minutes, Hermione," chided Petunia. "You were early."</p><p>"Says you."</p><p>Petunia sniffed. "<em>I</em> had to take public transport. You live only a few streets over. What's your excuse, Miss Witch?"</p><p>"Anxiety," deadpanned Hermione. She looked at the table, drumming her fingers on it. "I think James suspects something."</p><p>"Oh?" asked Petunia, trying to keep her voice deceptively light.</p><p>"When I said goodbye, earlier," explained Hermione, voice small. "I know that after this, I'm going to the Haberdashery to meet with Barty and Reg and to put our plan in motion, but <em>James</em> doesn't know that."</p><p>"Keeping secrets from your husband again, Hermione?" Petunia's voice was filled with derision. "I thought we were past this."</p><p>Hermione grimaced at the rebuke. "Yeah, well…"</p><p>"You're not fighting, though, are you?" asked Petunia pointedly.</p><p>"No," said Hermione. Her stomach clenched at the thought of fighting while carrying around an extra seven pounds and how her center of gravity was <em>very</em> off. "James was insistent, as were Barty and Reg. They're going to do everything."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips and Petunia ignored her in favour of looking through the menu. That occupied their time for several minutes, until Petunia finally huffed, looking up and around the restaurant, and then down at her wrist and the delicate-looking watch. "It's been thirty. Where's Lily?"</p><p>"Maybe she got delayed," suggested Hermione. Her stomach rumbled. "Let's just order."</p><p>"How does one of your kind get <em>delayed</em>?" groused Petunia, a pinched look on her face. "You can teleport!"</p><p>Hermione ignored her and caught a waiter's eye. The two women ordered and then settled back, discussing nonsensical things like their parents, Sean, his parents, and then ending up on the topic of babies and Hermione's approaching due date.</p><p>Dermot Bowes was adorable, sleeping for most of their lunch and only waking up to make some disappointed and upset squawks that Petunia quickly soothed after a trip to the loo. By the time their plates were cleared, and they had moved on to finishing their dessert, both sisters were worried.</p><p>"Things have been better," muttered Hermione, her stomach roiling. "Lily wouldn't've have skipped this without saying something."</p><p>Petunia's lips were tightly pinched into a line. "Surely, <em>she's</em> not fighting, either?"</p><p>"I hope not," sighed Hermione. "But she also doesn't have a partner telling her to stay home, does she?"</p><p>Petunia eyed Hermione. "She still hasn't told you who the baby's father is?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"I still bet it's that Snape boy," muttered Petunia nastily. "She always liked him."</p><p>"She said it wasn't—"</p><p>"Do you really believe her?"</p><p>Hermione squirmed uncomfortably in her seat, her back muscles tight. "Lily said she hasn't spoken to him since my kidnapping—"</p><p>Petunia's laugh was derisive. "And you believe her?"</p><p>"She's given me no reason otherwise," muttered Hermione mulishly. "Why don't <em>you</em> believe her?"</p><p>Whatever answer Petunia was going to give Hermione was cut off when a commotion at the front of the restaurant caught their attention, as well as the others in the dining room. A wide-eyed, wild-haired Barty loomed over the host, speaking rapidly, and confusing them.</p><p>"Sir, please—"</p><p>"Look, she's right over there! It's <em>important</em>!"</p><p>Hermione pushed back from the table, waving, and calling, "Barty!"</p><p>He pushed past the host, revealing that Regulus was behind him, and wove through the aisles between tables to reach her and Petunia. As soon as he reached her, he had her wrapped in his arms, squeezing tightly.</p><p>"Barty—" gasped Hermione.</p><p>"You're alright," he mumbled against her.</p><p>She patted his back. "Er, yes. Yes, I am."</p><p>"Thank Merlin you're safe," muttered Regulus lowly when he approached, looking between her and Petunia, who was warily eyeing the two. "When we went by the house, and it was empty—" he shuddered.</p><p>"What's going on?" asked Hermione, drawing back from Barty, but he hovered at her side, his arm pressed against her.</p><p>"Madam, are these two with you?" asked their waiter, eyeing the two wizards with a suspicious glint.</p><p>Petunia was the one who answered, as both Barty and Regulus seemed incapable of responding as Regulus held Hermione's chair out and Barty ushered her back into it. "They're my sister's friends, thank you."</p><p>The waiter disappeared again, leaving the four at the table alone.</p><p>"Diagon Alley was attacked two hours ago," said Regulus quietly, making Hermione and Petunia lean in to hear him.</p><p>Hermione stared. "What?!"</p><p>He nodded, and Barty said, "My father was called into work. The Aurors have all been called in, too, even off-duty ones."</p><p>"Whatever for?" asked Petunia, but Hermione knew.</p><p>"They're planning an assault," she said.</p><p>Regulus nodded. "Father went by the Ministry, as well, and sent Kreacher to me with information. Barty's father is pushing for a Taboo on any use of the Unforgiveables and has been meeting with the Department of Mysteries for them to cast it. There's news that something big is going on today."</p><p>Fear wormed its way into Hermione, making her taste bile. "Do you think someone found out what we're planning?"</p><p>Barty and Regulus shared a concerned look, with Regulus venturing tentatively, "Baby Lestrange is on our side—"</p><p>"But he could have been tortured," muttered Barty. "His brother is married to your cousin, and they're both real—"</p><p>"Yes, thank you," said Regulus loudly over Barty. "I know."</p><p>"If he's been compromised," began Hermione, her brain firing as she moved through their options, "We need to move, now. The plans have to be scraped."</p><p>"You were going to do something <em>today</em>?" sputtered Petunia, eyes wide. "Hermione!"</p><p>She guiltily looked at Petunia. "This was why I didn't want to say anything and do this lunch. It would have been one of the last times—"</p><p>"<em>Hermione</em>!" wailed Petunia.</p><p>"Ssshhh!" said Barty, eyes darting around.</p><p>"Tuney, I'm <em>sorry</em>," said Hermione emphatically, turning to her sister with wide eyes. "You know why."</p><p>Petunia's lips trembled. Her blue eyes darted between her sister, Barty, and Regulus, returning on Hermione. She was pale, and clearly emotionally wrung, but she clenched the edge of the table and said, "Go."</p><p>Hermione blinked. "What?"</p><p>"Go," repeated Petunia through gritted teeth. "Don't make me say it again, Hermione Evans. Go and save the world."</p><p>"Petunia…" breathed Hermione, standing, and coming around the table to her side.</p><p>Petunia rose and hugged Hermione tightly. She pushed away from her just as quickly though, eyes wet. "<em>Go</em>."</p><p>Hermione nodded, turning to her friends. Regulus gathered her purse and Barty ushered her from the table. They had only made it a few paces when Petunia called her name.</p><p>"Hermione?"</p><p>She turned.</p><p>"Be careful. And…" Petunia bit at her lip. "Come back safe. Just because <em>you</em> don't think the prophecy is in play, doesn't mean that others won't."</p><p>Hermione nodded. "Love you, Tuney."</p><p>"Love you, too, brat," her older sister called back.</p><p>"C'mon, let's go to the Haberdashery," muttered Regulus. "We can apparate from the corner, there's a park there."</p><p>As they left the restaurant, Hermione felt Petunia's eyes on her back, warm and heavy. She only hoped it wasn't the last time she'd see her.</p><hr /><p>Stuck between Regulus and Barty as they side-apparated her, Hermione wobbled when they appeared in the alleyway to the entrance of the Haberdashery, feeling queasy. Her stomach clenched and for a moment, she thought she was going to throw up.</p><p>"Ugh…"</p><p>Regulus stiffened beside her, even as she hung her head, eyes squinting at the pavement. "Hey – do the wards feel odd to you…?"</p><p>"What are you talking about?" asked Barty.</p><p>The air shifted in front of them, and Hermione jerked her head up just in time to see a red light – a stunning spell – hit Barty in the chest, sending him to the ground.</p><p>He yanked on Hermione's arm as he went down, causing her balance to shift. She turned on her heel, twisting it and cried out as another hit Regulus.</p><p>"My, my," oozed a familiar voice. "This was far too easy."</p><p>Hermione looked to the side in time to see Bellatrix drop her disillusionment charm, and for the stunning spell to hit her squarely, sending Hermione into unconsciousness. But she woke with a gasp, eyes wide and her thundering, aware that time had passed and that she was no longer in the alley but instead a dreary-looking room stone room with shelves, glass jars, and the damp cold of an underground cellar. Familiar arms, holding her tightly, squeezed a warning.</p><p>"Awake, are you, blood traitors?"</p><p>Regulus groaned at her other side. "Oh, fuck you, too, Bella."</p><p>Bellatrix scowled at her cousin, flicking her wand. Regulus clamped his mouth shut as his body bowed on the floor, convulsing.</p><p>"Regulus!" shouted Hermione and Barty in tandem. Barty drew her closer to him and partially behind, keeping her hidden from Bellatrix's wand.</p><p>After a moment, Regulus breathed heavily, panting, and Bellatrix cackled. "Oh, my itty-bitty cousin can't handle a wittle pain?"</p><p>Regulus ignored her.</p><p>She turned her dark eyes on Barty and Hermione, a malicious sheen to them. "And here's the halfbreed and mudblood. That blood traitor Potter's been breeding with you, has he, muddy?"</p><p>"It's old news, Bella, but when you're nothing more than a maniac's pathetic minion, I can guess that reading the gossip rags isn't on the agenda between murder and mayhem," replied Hermione dryly.</p><p>Bellatrix hissed like an angry cat.</p><p>"Watch your tongue, girl," threatened Bellatrix, brandishing her wand at Hermione. Barty shifted more in front of her in response. "I'll teach you to respect your betters!"</p><p>Hermione's response was a dry look at the elder witch.</p><p>Incensed, Bellatrix raised her wand.</p><p>"That's enough, Bella," reprimanded a cultured voice. "The Dark Lord wants her alive, remember?"</p><p>"Alive isn't the same as unharmed," muttered the witch petulantly, but she stepped back, revealing Lucius standing in the open doorway, his face cast in shadow.</p><p>The Malfoy heir stepped into the room, making its small space even tighter. Barty pressed tighter against her, and Regulus crab-crawled backward until his back was pressed against the wall facing the door. He leaned against a burlap bag of some kind and hoisted himself partially up.</p><p>Lucius' gaze was impassive as he surveyed the three. "What have you been doing?"</p><p>"Nothing," muttered Bellatrix. "Just getting reacquainted with my wittle cousin—"</p><p>"You were to grab them and leave them here for collection," snapped Lucius, eyes tight. "They must be in sound mind to answer <em>his</em> questions—"</p><p>"He'll just torture them anyway." Bellatrix rolled her eyes. "So, I got started and prepared them for the Dark Lord."</p><p>Lucius hissed, inhaling sharply. "That's enough. I am going to the potions laboratory and getting Black something for his pain. Do <em>not</em> do anything else while I'm gone."</p><p>The threat seemed to linger in the air between the two. Bellatrix stuck her tongue out as soon as Lucius turned his back. He shut the door behind himself, the lock engaging with a heavy thud.</p><p>"<em>Don't do anything while I'm gone</em>," mimicked Bellatrix in a high voice, exaggerating her face into a pinched look that was supposed to be Malfoy. She turned back to face Barty and Hermione, dismissively glancing over Regulus as he panted and stared up at her.</p><p>"Out of the way, blood traitor," she snapped, wand twitching. The spell careened Barty away from Hermione, sending him flying into the wall, where he slumped and groaned.</p><p>"Barty!" cried Hermione, leaning forward while keeping her hands pressed to the wall behind her. Regulus pushed himself up, staring at their friend with wide eyes.</p><p>Bellatrix advanced with a manic light in her eyes. "Let's have a talk, girl to girl—"</p><p><em>BOOM</em>.</p><p>The thunderous noise reverberated down from above, shaking the thick walls and sending floating pieces of mortar and dust onto them, turning the air cloudy for a moment. Regulus had thrown himself toward her, trying to cover her from harm.</p><p>Hermione blinked back against the dust cloud, coughing.</p><p>"Alright?" he muttered, sitting back. His black hair was grey, and his pale face was an odd chalky colour from where the dust clotted against his sweaty skin.</p><p>She nodded, looking back toward Bellatrix, who whirled, a snarl on her wide mouth. She yanked open the cellar door and spat, "What was that?"</p><p>"Apologies, Lady Lestrange—"</p><p>"<em>Black</em>!" she snarled.</p><p>The Death Eater outside paused and then continued with a shaky voice: "Lady Black. We'll go investigate—"</p><p>"No need," hissed Bellatrix, turning to glance at Regulus helping Hermione to her feet. "We all know who it is."</p><p><em>We do?</em> seemed to be on the Death Eater's mind, as well as Hermione and Regulus' as they looked at one another in confusion.</p><p>"It seems that the blood traitor has come for his mudblood," explained Bellatrix with a haughty sniff that was eerily reminiscent of Petunia, enough so that Hermione turned her face into Regulus' shoulder to hide her laugh.</p><p>"You think that's funny, muddy?" Bellatrix stalked forward, stepping over Barty's prone form, and dug her wand against the soft skin of Hermione's neck, making her strain her head back. Together, they walked backward until Hermione was pressed against the wall – although Bellatrix was awkwardly leaning over her belly.</p><p>"Bella!" shouted Regulus.</p><p>"I wasn't laughing," replied Hermione quietly, eyes focused on Bellatrix's.</p><p>"No, that's the blood traitor's hobby, isn't it?" the witch continued. Her wand trailed down Hermione's neck, across her sternum, and then rested the tip against her stomach. It twisted in nerves and Hermione swallowed thickly. "No… let's see if he'll be laughing if I present his baby, torn from your stomach. No loss with your death."</p><p>Fear crept through Hermione – but so did determination. She might be without a wand, but she could do enough transmutation that Bellatrix would not be expecting any form of defence. Low, at her hip, she curled her hand and prepared, gathering her magic.</p><p>"<em>Didn't</em> I tell you to leave them alone?!" Lucius Malfoy snarled as he threw himself forward into the room, eyes wide.</p><p>Bellatrix heaved a sigh. "Malfoy – you might be married to my little sister, but I swear—"</p><p>"You're needed above," he interrupted sharply. "I've already sent the others outside here topside. Dumbledore's here."</p><p>Silence engulfed those in the root cellar.</p><p>Bellatrix stiffened and stood straight, her wand leaving Hermione's stomach as she stepped away. "What?"</p><p>"Him and his Order. The wards around the manor fell – I saw Macnair, and he said it was Rabastan—"</p><p>Hermione and Regulus shared a concerned glance, a grimace on Regulus' face.</p><p>"—and now they're spilling into the house. We're to fight them off," finished Lucius.</p><p>Bellatrix gave another wordless snarl. She cut her eyes toward Hermione. "This isn't over, muddy. It just gives me the opportunity to kill you in front of your blood traitor husband."</p><p>She gave a sharp glare at Regulus and stalked out, her hair crackling with magic as it expanded and lifted. Her heels clicked on the stone as she walked away, and it was only once they faded that Lucius turned to her and Regulus, his hand in his robes.</p><p>Regulus tensed as he withdrew it, expecting the man's wand.</p><p>Instead, it was three, familiar wands.</p><p>"There's very little time," the blond began, voice low. His eyes were wide, and he looked a bit terrified. "Dumbledore and his Order are here, but they're not alone. As I was coming back, a few others reported Aurors appearing at the edge of the wards. Whatever it is you were planning on doing, Evans – you're going to have to do it now."</p><p>"Thank you," said Hermione, taking her and Barty's wands. Regulus took his and went to help their friend, reviving him with a low murmured spell. "You should leave if you can. Go home to Narcissa."</p><p>Lucius sent her an unreadable look. "I may not have a choice but to stay and fight, myself."</p><p>Hermione nodded, resigned.</p><p>"Go."</p><p>Barty, leaning unsteadily against Regulus, were the first two out of the room. Hermione followed behind them, one hand on her stomach and the other gripping her wand tightly. She left the cellar, looking up and down the low-ceiling corridor. "Which way?"</p><p>"Whichever takes us up, I guess," muttered Regulus, and with a shrug, they turned and began walking.</p><p>The lower levels of Lestrange Manor were labyrinthine and worrisomely dark, with damp walls and low ceilings that created a muffled, claustrophobic feeling. Their shuffled steps were nothing more than whispers against the thick stone – and if <em>they</em> were quiet, so too were any Death Eaters down there with them. The only noise came from their heavy breathing – from fear and adrenaline – and the muffled, dull thuds and booms from above them.</p><p>"How long has it been?" asked Regulus, voice low.</p><p>Hermione grimaced. "I don't know."</p><p>Torches flickered as they turned a sharp corner.</p><p>"There they are! Stop them!" shouted a Death Eater, one of four.</p><p>Spellfire immediately sped toward them. Regulus snapped his wand out and a translucent shield appeared before them, white ripples spreading out wherever the enemy fire hit.</p><p>Barty threw himself off Regulus and had his wand out, as well. He sank low, to his knees, and used the space under the shield Regulus conjured, aiming for the Death Eaters' lower halves. A severing charm at the knee sent one Death Eater tipping sideways, wailing in agony, and Hermione (with a fond, but vicious, smile on her lips) set another on fire. The blue flames licked up the thick, heavy Death Eater robes; smoke billowed and obscured the Death Eater's vision, which clued him into being on fire. He began to flail his arms, shouting.</p><p>That didn't last, unfortunately; a fellow Death Eater easily put the flames out. The spell had only incited the Death Eater, and the final three turned their attention on Hermione, Barty, and Regulus.</p><p>A barrage of spells – yellow, green, blue, red – splashed against the shield. They sizzled, sparked, and cracked loudly against the spell keeping the three safe, the white ripples widespread and making the translucent shield more of a smoky white. It also showed the limits of its boundaries, and several spells slipped past; one made Barty throw himself into Regulus' legs to avoid it.</p><p>Regulus gritted his teeth and slid back an inch, then another. He brought up his left hand and held tight to his right wrist, stiffening the joint of the hand that held his wand. The tip smoked. "I can't hold this forever!" he shouted.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and spread her hands, feeling the air between Regulus and the shield, and reinforced it with her own magic. The smokiness vanished as Regulus dropped his spell and Hermione's took over.</p><p>He was sweating around his hairline, exhaustion pulling lines tight around his eyes. "We need to end this."</p><p>Barty nodded, eyes dark and fixated.</p><p>One of the wizards shouted something indistinguishable, and a vibrant purple burst from his hand. Barty, in return, raised his wand and made a sharp flick. One Death Eater bounced hard against the wall and ended up in the line of fire from one of his compatriots – he immediately began to scream as his skin peeled off his bare hands, flaking.</p><p>Hermione stared. "Well, thank <em>God</em> you stopped that one!"</p><p>The last two Death Eaters, however, seemed to be far more competent. Their spells were all over the place, always forcing Barty and Regulus to move, testing the boundaries of Hermione's shield. The three were slowly being forced back, pressing against the wall of the L-shaped corridor instead of being able to retreat down the side passage. Every time Barty tried to launch toward its safety, a Killing Curse or something else equally dangerous was slung his way.</p><p>"We're pinned," spat Regulus, furiously, as his eyes darted around the space.</p><p>"We can't keep this up," agreed Hermione with a heavy frown, twisting her hands and spreading her fingers as the shield she made flickered before holding, shrinking in size.</p><p>Then –</p><p>"Gurk!"</p><p>One of the remaining Death Eaters tumbled forward, head tilted down to see the gaping hole in his chest, robes and innards blasted out in a spray of blood and bone. He fell hard to the floor, making everyone pause in shock.</p><p>"What—"</p><p>The last Death Eater barely had a moment to think. A strong burst of wind sent him bowling head over feet, toward Hermione, Barty, and Regulus. Hermione dropped the shield and Regulus snapped <em>flipendo </em>at the man. Caught between the two spells, his body thrashed and floundered, and then his head turned too sharply. There was an audible <em>snap</em> in the corridor, and then the man fell to the floor with a thud as both spells were ended.</p><p>Behind them, breathing heavily, Sirius tried to make light by saying, "Well, I wasn't expecting my <em>confringo</em> to blast people apart."</p><p>"Sirius!" gasped Regulus in relief, taking a few wobbling steps forward.</p><p>Both Hermione and Barty sagged toward one another, also in relief. They were sweaty and shivering, and Hermione was far more exhausted than she normally was. Sirius's arrival was exactly what they needed.</p><p>Sirius met Regulus, clutching his little brother to him for a tight moment, and then stepped back with his hands on his shoulders. His grey eyes peered all over his face. "Are you alright? Have you been hurt?"</p><p>"Bellatrix tortured him with the Cruciatus," offered Hermione, moving forward when Regulus refused to speak. "But she didn't have much time to do anything else."</p><p>Sirius's eyes then swept over her, lingering on her belly. "Are you well, too, Princess?"</p><p>She scowled, crossing her arms, goodwill of his timely save evaporating. "Fine."</p><p>He gave Hermione a toothy grin, and then it faded as he settled into a determined pose, turning from joker to Auror in a heartbeat. "C'mon, we need to get you three out of here."</p><p>"What's going on above?" asked Regulus, falling into step with Sirius as the older wizard ushered them the way he came, further down the long corridor.</p><p>"Dumbledore got word from a spy that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named would be here and all but declared we were going to do a massive attack," explained Sirius, voice tight. He kept them moving, footsteps light. "We arrived about twenty minutes ago. The wards were down, letting us in, but we were expected. We've been fighting since."</p><p>"Is James here, too?" asked Hermione quietly, peering up at Sirius.</p><p>His face was tight, tense when he nodded. "He sent me to find you when we overheard some Death Eaters talking about capturing someone important." He paused, glancing at her quickly before facing forward again. "And a prophecy."</p><p>Bile rose in Hermione's mouth. All her careful planning with Barty and Regulus – about facing Voldemort on their terms – and it had been overtaken by chance from the Order! Voldemort had called everyone to the Manor and made it their battleground, and Hermione hadn't anticipated nor prepared for it. They had been hoping for the Forest of Dean in a month or so, with enough time to boobytrap the Forest.</p><p><em>Nothing to it,</em> she thought, mouth pursed. They would have to make do.</p><p>Muffled, echoing voices from further ahead of them had Sirius swearing. He shoved Regulus ahead of him down a side passage, this one darker and narrower than others; Barty and Hermione scurried after them.</p><p>Sirius bodily shielded Hermione, pressing her further into the damp wall as the noises grew louder. Hermione found herself holding her breath and squeezing her eyes shut, thinking over and over: <em>don't see us don't see us don't see us</em>. Her magic obliged, and the shimmer of a Notice-Me-Not spell enveloped them.</p><p>A large group of Death Eaters raced past them, not even one stopping or peering in their direction. Sirius waited until the noise from their footsteps was gone, and then tugged Regulus out first, checking both directions.</p><p>With a heavy exhale, and face turned in the direction the Death Eaters went, he muttered, "I came down through a servant's staircase, about ten yards further down this hallway. Get to it, and you'll emerge in the conservatory, near the organ, on the ground floor. It's close to the back gardens – there's a maze out there, I think – get to it and get past the maze and you'll reach the ward boundary. You can escape."</p><p>Hermione, Barty, and Regulus shared a look.</p><p>"We're not going anywhere," said Regulus stubbornly, jutting his jaw.</p><p>Sirius bit back another swear, glaring at his brother. "This isn't the time to play hero, Reg—"</p><p>"Then when <em>is</em>?" he countered sharply.</p><p>"Ugh!" Sirius turned to face away and then stilled. Hermione was reminded of a dog sensing its prey. His lips flattened into a tight line. "There's someone coming. You need to go. <em>Now</em>."</p><p>From near where they had been pinned, at the beginning of the long hallway and the L-intersection, the same large group of Death Eaters that passed them earlier appeared. They were dark shadows in their robes, their bone-white masks eerily floating as they sped forward, like apparitions that only appeared between the flickering torchlight, decreasing the space between them in sharp bursts.</p><p>"Go!" shouted Sirius, pushing Regulus. He already had his wand out and was cutting it diagonally through the air. A large red wave pulsed and sped down the remaining space and slammed into two of the Death Eaters, sending them to the floor. They were only stepped over by the others, who continued to advance; some even already began sending familiar, sickly green spells toward them, splashing well away from the four.</p><p>"Not without you," retorted Regulus sharply, joining Sirius with his own spellfire, clearly doing more aiming than wide-range spells like his brother, as potshots.</p><p>"Damn it, Reg!" Sirius' eyes were wide and wild. "You're my little brother—"</p><p>"Not. Without. You," he repeated, voice low. His eyes caught Sirius' – both grey, both resolute – and finally, Sirius nodded.</p><p>Regulus sent a look behind, over his shoulder, at Hermione and Barty. It was pleading.</p><p>Hermione heaved a deep breath. She didn't like the idea of splitting up, but… She stepped forward and hugged Regulus tight. "Don't die," she muttered into his ear, breathing in his familiar scent and feeling his warmth.</p><p>"I don't plan to," he replied, stepping back. She moved away and Barty took her place.</p><p>Hermione turned to Sirius, as Regulus took up the defence. He looked a bit strained, lines at the corner of his eyes a bit more pronounced, but he took the time to give her a tight, reassuring smile. "What, no words of comfort for me, Princess?"</p><p>With a mild shake of her head to hide her smile, Hermione hugged him tight. Sirius was pleased and equally surprised, but hugged her back, lifting her briefly off her feet. When he released her, he gave her a small smile. "Keep that godson of mine safe, Hermione."</p><p>"You too, Padfoot," she replied, slowly drawing away.</p><p>A sizzle of yellow passed too close for comfort over Sirius's shoulder, and he startled in surprise. He turned, but Hermione was slow to step away, watching as the two Black brothers stood shoulder-to-shoulder, a shield between the incoming Death Eaters and Barty and Hermione.</p><p>Barty was the one who tugged Hermione away a few steps, toward the servant's staircase. "We need to go," he muttered to her.</p><p>She nodded and stepped back, once, twice. Then, they were jogging, finding the still-open servant's door where Sirius described. Hermione glanced once more back at the brothers; Regulus waved them off and then turned to look at Sirius, who grinned at his brother. With their flyaway black hair, matching wild smiles, they had never looked so alike.</p><p>She dove into the dark, narrow, steep staircase and began to climb.</p><p>Barty, behind her, took one last look, catching Sirius' eyes. There was something in them that Barty did not expect: guilt and apology. There had never been time for them to discuss what had happened at the Shrieking Shack, all those years ago, for all that their social lives had become entangled. So, Barty did the only thing he could. He nodded, once, solemnly to Sirius, and let go of his own anger at the man. It had a time and place, and this wasn't it.</p><p>He shut the servant's staircase door behind himself, plunging both him and Hermione into darkness.</p><p>The climb was hard in the dark. Hermione conjured a floating ball of bluebell flames, but they were weak and flickered uncomfortably whenever they heard thuds or screams through the stone and wood walls.</p><p>The flames fizzled out completely when, from below them at the base of the stairs, they heard the wood splinter from the door and bottom few steps, becoming nothing more than a messy mass of splinters and debris that blocked anyone from pursuing them – and kept Regulus and Sirius from joining them.</p><p>"Keep going," urged Barty from behind Hermione, helping her as she stumbled in the dark, slamming her knee on one sharp step.</p><p>The air was stagnant and dusty, making each breath they took like tiny razor blades cutting them with every inhale. Dust made Hermione's nose twitch, and the encompassing dark made her hands tremble, her brain imagining scenarios behind every scream, cry, or shout they heard.</p><p>He pushed her from behind until they reached the top. Hermione fumbled in the dark, feeling around for a latch or cord or handle to open the door to the conservatory. Her fingers finally caught on the metal, and she pulled, the door swinging open.</p><p>She and Barty tumbled out, gasping for fresh air.</p><p>"How kind of you to join us, Ms. Evans," a sibilant voice declared, making Hermione jerk her head up. "Mr. Crouch. Welcome."</p><p>The conservatory was no longer empty: the organ they should have been able to use as cover had been pushed up against the far wall, leaving the carpeted space open. Near the windows, Rabastan Lestrange was curled up, blood pooling underneath him and staining the carpet.</p><p>Above him, Voldemort loomed, but he turned his back on the teenager and pocketed his wand to face Hermione and Barty. At his side, Roldophus stared back passively, his face entirely blank. There were others who lingered around the Dark Lord and prone teenager, many whom Hermione recognized: Macnair, Snyde, Avery, Rosier, Crabbe, Goyle, Pyrites, the Carrow siblings, Mulciber…</p><p>"Fuck," whispered Barty, terrified, with wide eyes and a pale face that made his freckles stand out all that more.</p><p>"Now, now," began Voldemort, red eyes focused on them. "There's no need for that kind of base language, Mr. Crouch. After all, we're all… <em>civilized</em> witches and wizards, here."</p><p>His pale, bloodless lips stretched into a parody of a welcoming smile, and he gestured them with a beckoning hand move. Hermione felt the foreign magic catch her, wrap around her middle and pull her resisting form across the carpet, her toes dragging behind. At her side, Barty followed, squirming in the grip.</p><p>The magic released them a few meters from the Dark Lord, but in the center of the room. The Death Eaters began to slowly fan out, creating a barrier and enclosing the two in along with Rabastan and Voldemort.</p><p>"Now, Ms. Evans," began Voldemort, that same fake, pleasant smile on his face. Dread pooled in Hermione, something prescient falling over her. She wasn't going to like what the wizard said next, she was sure.</p><p>"What is this prophecy I am hearing about <em>you</em> being the greatest hope to defeating <em>me</em>?"</p><hr /><p>TBC…</p>

    <p>Chapter End Notes</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I am <i>so</i> sorry about not replying to comments. You all left some amazing, wonderful replies to the previous chapter and I barely had time to read them, not to mention reply, and then they suddenly tumbled into 300+ in my inbox here and... I might have died a little thinking about getting to them all at some point. For those of you who also read my Game of Thrones stories, you might know that I quit my teaching job in December when the Fall semester ended. I now have a new job, but this one is a 9-to-5, Monday through Friday, so my free time to write has been significantly cut despite being work from home.</p><p>However! We are nearing the end. There are about 2 more chapters, I think. <strike>I'm hoping to have this story entirely complete before 2022 comes to an end. The goal is this summer!</strike> So, hang in there and enjoy the wild ride. Many, many, thanks to <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/CelestialSeaWitch/pseuds/CelestialSeaWitch" rel="nofollow">CelestialSeaWitch</a> for her help in planning these final chapters, and who's been spoiled with the upcoming plot... although I might have thrown in a few more curveballs that you're not expecting! 😎</p><p><b>Aug 2023 edit</b>: I had a baby in late 2022. RL takes priority over writing fanfic. This story is NOT abandoned. I am still working on the final two chapters; I write in segments and jump from scene to scene instead of linearly, which means the final two chapters are being written concurrently. This story WILL be finished - please stop leaving comments saying it's abandoned because it is not. I have outgrown Harry Potter fandom (as seen by my more recent story updates), but I am committed to finishing this story because it has been a labour of love. It will just take a longer time, and I'm hoping that once my little one is in daycare and I'm back at work I will be able to write more.</p><p><b>October 2024 update</b>: I know many people are waiting for the last two chapters, and they ARE coming... my muse has a harder time with YiT compared to other stories, right now, and my RL hasn't been going so great this year. There's been a lot of ups and downs and stresses that have zapped a lot of energy and focus. If you want to know more, you can see my author's notes in Memories of Tomorrow, instead.</p><p>That said, the last two chapters are almost FULLY outlined. Parts are written - with gaps in the middle and end. There's a chance that chapter 28 will be split into two, or even three, parts because Lily's section alone is 20 pages, single-spaced. Sirius and Regulus' part is over 20 pages. I haven't even written in full Rabastan, Crouch, or James' sections. Not to mention the main fight with Voldemort. 😱😱</p><p>However, parts of the epilogue are already written - most of it, actually - so once the next chapter (28) is written in full, the last chapter will follow quickly. It's just getting through this large one, ensuring it flows, editing, and then posting.</p></blockquote>

  <p align="center">Yesterday is Tomorrow (Everything is Connected)</p><p align="center">TWENTY-EIGHT</p><hr /><p><strong>Deacon</strong>: I am not a goddamned red shirt! I have a purpose!</p><p>- <em>12 Monkeys</em> (TV show)</p><hr /><p>He bloody should have known better. He <em>really</em> should have known better – trusting bloody Evans and Crouch and Black!</p><p>Oh, yes, they'd <em>help</em>, he scoffed, they'd keep him <em>safe</em>.</p><p>Well, how safe was he now, staring at his older brother in the ward room off the library in their ancestral seat? How safe was he <em>now</em>, with Rodolphus' mouth pressed into a hard line, eyes lingering on the blood that dripped from a small cut on Rabastan's hand, smeared on his wand? The only saving grace Rabastan had was that his brother's wand was unsheathed but aimed at the floor.</p><p>And how safe was he now when Bellatrix began cackling as she peered around her husband, eyes wide and alight with glee and madness?</p><p>"Oh, wittle 'Bastian," she cooed, slipping around Rodolphus and pressing the pads of her fingertips against her blood-red lips in delight. "Has he been caught red-handed doing something <em>naughty</em>?"</p><p>Rabastan pressed his lips together, hard. He ignored his sister-in-law, keeping his eyes on his brother instead. She was the more dangerous creature in the room, but… <em>his brother</em>.</p><p>"Bast," began Rodolphus, in his usual monotone voice, eyes unwaveringly locked on him. "Step away from the ward key."</p><p>He didn't. He remained still, wand tip hovering just scant inches from touching the seal and breaking the wards that surrounded the ancestral Lestrange house and property. One touch, one touch from a Lestrange by blood, and they'd come crashing down.</p><p>And he'd let in the Order. He'd let in Crouch, and Black, and Evans-<em>Potter</em>. That's what they asked of him when he had gone crawling to them for sanctuary and help. They saved Narcissa, and Lucius owed them and paid his debt by providing a book. Rabastan was to pay back his debt, of nearly getting them killed, by bringing the wards down.</p><p>Hardly equal for what he put them through, he initially thought. He disagreed with that, now.</p><p>But… things change.</p><p>The Dark Lord attacked Diagon Alley that morning, incensed with Gringott's, of all things. It was a slaughter, spilling from the bank to the streets. He'd gone back to one of the other Death Eater's houses, for a little anyway. But they were all scrambling, fulfilling orders he hissed at them.</p><p>Bellatrix had disappeared and just returned, detouring from the dungeons.</p><p>Rabastan had an idea of who might be there. "What are you doing, wittle 'Bastan?" cooed Bellatrix in her high-pitched falsetto. "Are you trying to be a big wizard?"</p><p>He dared to remove his eyes from his brother to shoot Bellatrix a nasty glare.</p><p>She cackled.</p><p><em>This isn't a betrayal</em>, he thought, desperately. <em>It </em>isn't<em>. Not really, anyway. </em>He wasn't going to be the one casting any spells when the wards came down. All he had to do with let the wards come down. That's all.</p><p>
  <em>Let them fall.</em>
</p><p>He swallowed, hard, knowing what he was going to have to do. Not what was asked of him, but what <em>he</em> was going to do, to assuage his own feelings of the matter.</p><p>Rabastan licked his lips. "I have to do this," he implored, staring hard at his older brother. The one who raised him, the one who taught him - maybe not right from wrong - but taught him regardless. He soothed any hurts, he taught him to be a Lestrange, to follow strength.</p><p>"Do you?" jeered Bellatrix, hovering close. He felt her shift around him, her long nails trailing across his back, a parody of a lover's caress.</p><p>The hairs at the back of his neck rose in response. He tried to contain a full-body shiver, but she saw it anyway.</p><p>Bellatrix cackled again and she danced away from, to the side. Her dark eyes were wide with something - excitement, maybe - and she gripped her wand tight with one hand and the end of her robes with the other, tugging at the hem in short, agitated yanks.</p><p>"Look at him <em>squirm</em>!" she squealed. "What is the wittle traitor planning, Roddy? Hmm? Shall we find out?"</p><p>Her wand flicked forward, the tip glowing a venomous green and sizzling, loud enough Rabastan could hear it over his pounding heart. "Maybe we should ask the boy."</p><p>Slowly, Rodolphus blinked, and then asked, his voice low and quiet, "What are you doing, Rabastan?"</p><p>"I–" For a moment, he was ready to deny he was doing anything. He glanced back at his wand tip, coated with his Lestrange blood, hovering – scant inches from a single tap to break down the wards.</p><p>"Do not lie," growled Rodolphus, voice rumbling as he shifted from monotone to something else. "What are you doing? Our Lord will be here at any moment–"</p><p>"Yes, yes!" Bellatrix hopped to the side, her wand sparking. Her lips stretched into a wide, red dash of a smile, her teeth abnormally white in the darkness of the library recess room. "The Dark Lord will be here soon! He'll get the truth out of you!"</p><p><em>Torture it out of me,</em> the thought whispered across Rabastan's mind unbidden. He never saw what happened to Crouch, Evans, or Black in the catacombs. Nor did he see them afterwards, in St. Mungo's. But he had heard, from Rodolophus, Bellatrix – others who had been there.</p><p>"No." The word ripped from his mouth before he registered he spoke.</p><p>Bellatrix paused, startled and for once, off-balanced. "No…?"</p><p>Rabastan took a deep breath, and, deliberately let his wandtip touch the keystone. Recognizing his blood, the wards <em>sang</em> in obedience.</p><p>"NO!" shouted Rodolphus, taking an aborted step forward, hand outstretched–</p><p>Bellatrix <em>shrieked</em>–</p><p>There was a moment of stillness.</p><p>A low hum vibrated beneath their feet, and then—like the snapping of a bone—the air shifted, a blast of air pushed its way out from the walls of the manor and across the grounds. A kaleidoscope of colour shimmered on the walls for a brief moment and then dissipated with a cascade of fallen stars.</p><p>The silence in the antechamber was heavier than the knowledge of what Rabastan had done. He swallowed, and the noise of it echoed in the room.</p><p>"You foolish child!" Rodlophus turned his furious, cold gaze on him, his expression shifting from shock to grim fury. "You've invited the enemy in!"</p><p>"Don't be silly, Roddy," scoffed Bellatrix, her voice finally dropping to her normal register as she stared at her brother-in-law. "The enemy was already within."</p><hr /><p>After Dumbledore's announcement, and the flurry of everyone leaving the house, Lily found herself sitting in the kitchen, blinking in shock at the abruptness of those around her. Images were disjointed: Frank kissing Alice passionately, a hand running down the swell of her belly; Sirius and James sharing a tight hug; Peter worrying his hands and paling dramatically until he turned to throw up in the sink; even veterans like the Prewett twins, and Moody, and Dearborn taking moments before hustling out.</p><p>It took Lily a few moments to realize she <em>wasn't</em> alone in the kitchen – Alice was with her, hands on her belly, just like Lily. They looked at each other, and then Lily grimaced. "Well, this bites."</p><p>Alice laughed, although it was strained. "The timing isn't ideal, no."</p><p>Lily sighed. "Well… I guess we should find something to do while we wait."</p><p>"Well…" Alice winced. "Like I said, the timing isn't ideal."</p><p>"What do you mean?" asked Lily, turning to look at her friend.</p><p>Alice sighed. "So. When everyone was leaving… uh… I think…"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"My water broke," bit out Alice, looking embarrassed. "And with Frank gone, and the others preparing for… for the battle – well, I didn't want to say anything."</p><p>"Alice!" gasped Lily, jumping out of her seat as much as she could in a similar state. She swayed. "You should have said something! Frank—" She turned toward the front door. "Should we call him back? He should be here when the baby is born!"</p><p>Alice shook her head, firmly. "No. No, Lily. Just… I need to get to St. Mungo's."</p><p>Lily bit her lip, hands fluttering around Alice's body. "We… we can't apparate. It's… it'll have to be the Knight Bus—"</p><p>Alice groaned, long and low. "S'fine," she slurred, hands reaching out and gripping Lily's <em>hard</em>.</p><p>Things were frantic then – Lily managed to haul Alice with her out of the cottage, toward the front of the building and down the dirt path, away from the site so they couldn't be traced back. Once they were down the country road, with several stops for Alice to breathe deeply, Lily stuck her wand out and summoned the Knight Bus.</p><p>There was a loud <em>bang!</em> as the purple double-decker careened from between two trees that leapt out of the way, skidding to a halt before them. A young woman, bored and pimply, exited and began to speak. "Welcome to the Knight Bus—"</p><p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Lily through heaving breaths, ignoring her own pain as she moved Alice forward. "We're in a bit of a rush, okay? My friend is in labour."</p><p>The girl's eyes bugged. "<em>Labour</em>? Like – like a <em>baby</em>?"</p><p>Lily stared at her. "<em>Exactly</em> like a baby."</p><p>"Merlin!" the girl cried, stepping back onto the steps. Alice and Lily managed to climb onboard and sank into a nearby bed. The girl watched them nervously, wringing her hands, but waited until Alice was properly seated. "And… and you?"</p><p>"<em>Me</em>?" asked Lily, incredulously.</p><p>The girl looked down at Lily's own extended belly.</p><p>Lily huffed. "I'm fine. But we need to get to St. Mungo's—"</p><p>"So no more!" the girl cried, launching back to the driver's seat. "Ernie – St. Mungo's! On the double!"</p><p>There was another bang and a lurch, and the Bus was <em>flying</em>, trees and buildings moving out of the way through the magic and charms on the bus as they raced across the English countryside. Eventually, the sparse, desolate countryside turned into suburban and then urban space, with tall buildings and finally skyscrapers and then a dingy, run-down storefront with a singular mannequin in the window.</p><p>Lily hurriedly counted out the coins as Alice stumbled down the steps, nearly tripping over her own feet after her. Once the two women were inside St. Mungo's, Lily stared for a moment at the peaceful quiet of the tiled entryway.</p><p>"Oh, good evening," the receptionist at the desk said, spotting them. "How can I…?"</p><p>"My friend is in labour," blurted Lily, even as Alice groaned, panting.</p><p>Immediately, the receptionist jumped up from her seat, her wand moving in a complicated pattern, and then touched her throat. "<em>Sonorus</em>. Front receptionist requesting help for advanced-stage pregnancy."</p><p>While the receptionist helped Alice sit to a few seats to a side, while waiting for the lime green robes of the mediwizard, Lily took the opportunity to sink into a seat, herself. Her hands were shaking, and her breath was coming out fast – everyone she knew was, at that moment, already at the Lestrange property or was in battle.</p><p>And she was sitting in St. Mungo's, twiddling her thumbs.</p><p>Bile crept up her throat. How could she just <em>sit</em> here? And do <em>nothing</em>? While her friends were fighting for their lives?</p><p>"Miss?"</p><p>Lily glanced up, seeing a mediwizard standing before her. She glanced around the lobby and realized Alice was missing; had she been that out of it?</p><p>"Miss – your friend has been taken to the obstetrics ward," the wizard patiently explained. "We're going to fill out some information for our records. Can you help with that? Beginning with her name and next of kin?"</p><p>"Sure," rasped Lily, nodding. "Her name is Alice—"</p><p>An alarm went off, once, a loud buzzing <em>blaarrt</em> that echoed through the empty hallway.</p><p>The mediwizard froze.</p><p>Lily blinked, looking around. She cleared her throat. "Her name is Alice Longbottom—"</p><p>The alarm blared again, the same buzzing noise. And then again, and again, and again, coming faster and louder. The sconces on the walls blared brightly, and then turned from a warm, inviting pale yellow to flashing red, dimming the hallway.</p><p>"What the—"</p><p>The mediwizard paled. "Great Merlin…"</p><p>"What?" asked Lily, turning to him. "What's going on?"</p><p>But there was a rushing of feet – mediwizards and mediwitches in their robes came pouring into the lobby area from several different hallways; there was an overlaying cacophony of noise from the <em>pop</em>s of those who apparated in. The receptionist at the desk shrieked and covered her ears.</p><p>Another set of dual-layered pops broke across the noise, loud, as two Aurors in red appeared. One was old, grizzled in a way like Moody, and the other was young, a trainee like Potter or Black. He was nervous while his mentor was stoic.</p><p>"Listen up!" the older man shouted, over the noise. Immediately, everyone went quiet. "The Aurors have been informed that there is a <em>massive</em> spellfight occurring in Lincolnshire. Aurors have already been dispatched – so what we need is volunteer mediwizards to join us for triage. No more than a dozen, and for the rest of you here at St. Mungo's to be ready to receive any wounded."</p><p><em>Or dead</em>, went unsaid.</p><p>There was a sombre hush in the lobby area.</p><p>"I'll go," said the mediwizard who was speaking to Lily earlier, a tall man with salt-and-pepper hair, pale and thin. The thin bar on his lime green robes indicated he was a senior mediwizard, and as his eyes surveyed the crowd, he called, "My team – to me."</p><p>A half dozen or so witches and wizards stepped forward – some with tense faces, and others terrified – but no one spoke up to complain.</p><p>A few others in the lobby spoke up about joining, and soon the Auror had his volunteers, counting them out and preparing a Portkey to take them to the site in Lincolnshire. As he began herding the mediwizards and mediwitches toward the blanket someone on staff provided, Lily found herself slowly moving closer to the group.</p><p><em>Lincolnshire. I bet that's where the Order is right now,</em> she thought, biting her lip. She inched forward a bit more.</p><p>"Alright? Everyone's touching the blanket?" asked the Auror gruffly.</p><p>There were a few murmurs in affirmative.</p><p>"Right then—"</p><p>And then, without realizing she was doing it, Lily stepped forward into the huddle, plopped her finger down on the blanket and then, in the next moment, felt the lurch by her navel as the Portkey activated.</p><p>The second everything stopped spinning, she was bent over, throwing her guts up, her abdomen rippling with a cramp as she did so.</p><p>"Who the fuck are you!?"</p><p>She looked up and saw the Auror gaping at her, eyes nearly bulging as they dropped to her stomach. "How did you touch the Portkey by mistake—"</p><p>"I'm part of Dumbledore's Order," announced Lily, straightening with a minor grimace. There was a small clearing, a tiny pocket farm pasture at the edge of the Lestrange Manor wards, with a winding dirt path that would lead into the nearest Muggle village. Trees lined either side of the road, one a dense forest and the other carefully placed clusters to protect the sight of the Manor house. "I know what's going on here and I can help."</p><p>"Help?" the Auror scoffed, looking at her midsection again. "Sweetheart, the only help you're going to be is if someone needs another shelf. You're a bloody liability!"</p><p>"I can fight—"</p><p>"My <em>arse</em> you can—"</p><p>"I'm not helpless!"</p><p>"Well, you're certainly not <em>useful</em> at the moment, are you?"</p><p>"What's going on here?" Both Lily and the Auror turned to see the senior mediwizard, who pursed his lips when he looked Lily over. "You. You came in with that pregnant witch. Why are you here?"</p><p>"I'm here to help!" repeated Lily hotly.</p><p>An explosion in the distance had the Auror swear. He turned away to look toward the sound – at a manor, peeking through a dense foliage of trees, with its lights on and magic rippling off it in multicoloured waves, lighting the evening sky up like the Aurora Borealis.</p><p>"Oh, bugger me," the Auror grunted. He glanced at Lily and the mediwizard again, and ordered, "Deal with her," before he began loping toward the manor, disappearing quickly.</p><p>'Dealing with her' meant turning to Lily and arching a very disapproving eyebrow that had Lily thinking of her father. She scowled as she crossed her arms, as an automatic response mechanism.</p><p>With a sigh, the man asked, "Do you have healing training?"</p><p>"Some," she replied tersely, wincing as she shifted her weight from foot to foot.</p><p>"Then you'd best come to triage," he said, holding her elbow and gently pulling her along, to where the other volunteers had erected a tent on the field. Like all wizard tents, it was bigger on the inside, with four or five rows of bed cots on one side, and a few partitioned cubbies with raised beds for any massive kinds of surgery or spell damage.</p><p>"Start with those bandages," the mediwizard instructed, pointing at several rolls of fabric. "Cut them up into strips with your wand. You'll be sitting as you do that."</p><p>Lily opened her mouth to protest, but the glare the man gave her swiftly had her snapping it shut. She glowered, almost stomping over to the seat by the basket of cloth, but as soon as her rear was on the chair, she sighed in pleasure.</p><p>After that, it was the tense calm before the storm, while everyone around her did their best to prepare for the inevitable.</p><p>At first, there were a few stragglers – all Aurors, mostly trainees sent back by their superiors – but she recognized Fabian Prewett at one point with a swirling burn on his arm, and Benjy Fenwick with a nasty gash that ran down his side and his leg, making him cry out in pain as he was swarmed by healers. Then, it was like a crashing wave, and Lily didn't have time to think or consider her aching feet or cramps.</p><p>Ultimately, she really should have expected it – but Lily was so focused on casting spells, watching carefully as her wand produced roll after roll of bandage, wrapping tightly around a never-ending line of injured wizards and witches as they stumbled into the medi-tent – but the resounding <em>boom</em> and hard shaking of the ground still startled her.</p><p>Lily made a sharp flick with her wand, the bandages she was directing around a bleeding bicep cutting off neatly, and then turned and raced from the tent as quickly as her heavily pregnant form allowed.</p><p>Outside, chaos reigned.</p><p>The sky – dark, cloudy without much light from a very hidden, pale moon – was lit up a sickly green with the Death Eater insignia hovered above, the skull and snake wavering like wispy, ethereal clouds of poison that slowly sank lower and lower to the ground. There were figures lit up by the green spell, tossing and turning head over heels in the sky while flashes of red, yellow, and vibrant green sped back and forth, sometimes dissipating as the spell hit a target.</p><p>It didn't take long for the Death Eaters to appear, slinking out of the evening's darkness as they made their way toward the tent. As one figure became two, became four, became nine, Lily swallowed hard and raised her wand, a golden barrier shimmering in the air between them – and the injured.</p><p>"It's the mudblood!" laughed one Death Eater, cackling madly as they stopped, close enough within the circle of light the tent emitted. "Are you a one-witch army, girl?"</p><p>"She's not," replied a different voice – the pale and thin middle-aged senior mediwizard from the tent. "We're all here. And we're not letting you get past us."</p><p>Without taking her eyes off the terrorist before her, Lily could sense others stepping up alongside her and the mediwizard, forming a line of defence. Their wands came up and their protective barriers joined with Lily's shimmering gold, some white, others silver, until there was a metallic sheen and a very solid feel to the spell keeping the Death Eaters from the tent.</p><p>The same Death Eater from earlier spoke. "That won't stop us."</p><p>"It'll hold," one mediwitch called, calmly.</p><p>Something was condescending in the Death Eater when he replied, "It really won't."</p><p>From the line of nearly a dozen Death Eaters, one peeled from the rest from the far end, hidden the most in the depths of darkness with his inky black robes and floating, white face mask. He seemed almost nonchalant in his approach, coming to rest right in the middle of the line defending the medical tent, barely five feet from Lily.</p><p>He raised his wand and began casting, and her eyes dropped to it.</p><p>She gasped. <em>She knew that wand</em>.</p><p>Her eyes darted back up, looking all over the mask, trying to peer through the narrow eye slit to see familiar, dark eyes. But everything was hooded and shaded; it didn't stop her from uttering through trembling lips, "<em>Sev</em>?"</p><p>The Death Eater's wand faltered.</p><p>Lily's hand and wand wavered. Her voice went shrill with emotion, choked with tears. "Sev – <em>please</em>. What are you doing? Merlin, <em>please</em>, don't do this!"</p><p>"What are you waiting for?" called the first Death Eater – the spokesperson of the group. Irritation lined his voice. "Bring down the barrier!"</p><p>Severus' wand flicked back up.</p><p>"Sev – <em>please</em>," begged Lily. "There are hurt witches and wizards in there!"</p><p>"That's the point!" cried the Death Eater. "The enemy! Blood traitors and mudbloods and halfbreeds who don't deserve a place in our world! They must be <em>removed</em> and <em>eradicated</em> – a stain, a blemish to our way of life!"</p><p>Lily gasped; eyes locked on Severus' mask. She asked, quietly, "Am <em>I</em> a stain that needs to be removed, Sev?"</p><p>He paused, only a tiny little thing; but then his wand snapped to the side with a crack, just as a giant tear appeared in the barrier between Lily and the mediwizard beside her, making him curse under his breath. Weblike cracks splintered across the metallic shield and then broke with the sound of breaking glass.</p><p>And then the Death Eaters were slinging spells at them.</p><p>Lily choked as the air thickened and someone cast a smokescreen; she coughed, hard, and her free hand dropped to cradle her belly as she scrambled back and tried to peer through teary eyes, looking for either friend or foe.</p><p>Severus found her first, launching forward and tightly gripping her upper arm. He hauled her toward him as he loomed over her. "What the hell are you doing here, Lily?" he hissed, mask discarded and greasy black hair swinging.</p><p>"I'm here, trying to help!" she grit out, desperately pulling at her arm that remained in his grip. "Let go!"</p><p>"You need to go," he shot back, voice low as he brought her closer. His eyes darted back and forth, trying to also see through the dense smoke. He made a decision and began hauling her – either away from the fight, or toward it, or away from the medical tent or not… neither of them knew – even as Lily dug her heels in the soft earth.</p><p>"Stop it! Stop it!" she cried, pulling at her arm.</p><p>"You need to run," he continued to instruct tersely, not looking back at her as they moved a few more steps forward. "I'll cover your retreat – you can make it to the wardline and, I don't know, Merlin, call the Knight Bus or something—"</p><p>Lily finally yanked her arm from his grip, causing him to twist on his heel to face her. He growled, "<em>Lily</em>—"</p><p>"No," she retorted sharply, causing him to snap his mouth shut. "No. I'm not leaving."</p><p>Severus stared at her, incredulous. "You <em>have</em> to, Lily – I can't protect you if you stay! You'll die!"</p><p>Lily's lips were tight, in a flat line even as she felt them tremble with emotion – fear, anger, desperation – but her hand was steady when she raised her wand.</p><p>"I'm right where I am meant to be," she said, eyes hard and wand not wavering as it pointed at him. "Between you and them."</p><p>He stared at her, stricken.</p><p>She stared back and waited.</p><p>Then he cursed, low, under his breath, spinning on his heel to face away from her. "Go," he ordered, voice rough, choked with something.</p><p>Lily's heart thundered in her chest. "Sev…?"</p><p>"Go, Lily!" he cried, turning back around, his dark eyes were shiny and wet.</p><p>She didn't need to be told again, turning, and waddling quickly back the way they came. She ducked under fiery red curses and twisted out of the way of something orange, her center of gravity completely off. She wobbled on one heel, and felt her heart leap into her throat at the idea of falling—</p><p>"I've got you," the same mediwizard from before said, grabbing onto her tightly.</p><p>He had a cut across his forehead, bleeding profusely, which stained the left side of his pale face from eyebrow to chin. There was something fierce in his eyes though, and a grim twist to his lips.</p><p>"You shouldn't be out here, fighting," the wizard continued sharply, glancing down at her belly. "Didn't you mention earlier you were feeling out of sorts?"</p><p>"I thought it was the situation!" protested Lily, even as he wrapped an arm around her shoulders and began guiding her, presumably to the tent. "Isn't it?"</p><p>"You're in labour," the wizard snapped. "And this is the wrong battlefield for you to be on right now. You should be in a hospital room, sucking on ice chips."</p><p>"I'd never forgive myself if I wasn't here," she replied quietly. "Not when my brother-in-law is out there fighting, or our friends, or people I respect and care about."</p><p>The wizard grumbled under his breath and then snapped his wand with a sharp flick. A fire whip uncoiled out of his wand and wrapped around a Death Eater that snuck up on them, burning him right through his robes and flesh underneath.</p><p>Lily gagged, stupefied at the horrific smell of burnt flesh and the man's screams before being abruptly cut off. "But – why –"</p><p>The wizard looked grimly at her. "It's war. And it's my patients or them. I don't have much sympathy with those who attack mediwizards and mediwitches who were just here to help – no matter what side. They made us pick a side, and I'll defend that to my dying breath."</p><p>Lily stared at the wizard for a moment, eyes wide. Then, she nodded. "Okay," she said quietly.</p><p>The wizard eyed her, but upon seeing her tight jaw and pursed lips, he gave an inaudible sigh, eyes looking away.</p><p>"Wand at the ready," he said instead, quietly.</p><p>Lily stood at his back, covering the other angle as they inched back to their starting point. The smoke swirled around their feet, blowing up in a gentle breeze.</p><p>"<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!" a harsh voice screamed from the left - and the wizard jerked and twisted a little, taking Lily with him as he conjured a bronze shield.</p><p>The Killing Curse hit it was a loud clang, sending sharp bronze splinters ricocheting in all directions.</p><p>Lily quickly responded, banishing the splinters back toward the voice - which gurgled, a wet sound, and then went silent.</p><p>The silence afterward was unnerving. Lily thought battles would be loud and chaotic; and, at the beginning, it had been. But now there was little sound, with a few screams or cut-off mutters and shouts. Most were casting silently, lighting the dense forest up in sickly splashes of colour.</p><p>"Let's go," muttered the mediwizard, tugging on Lily's sleeve.</p><p>She kept quiet, knowing he couldn't see her acknowledging nod in the dark.</p><p>They were only a few steps when a sharp, piercing scream broke through the night, making both of them freeze - Lily in terror.</p><p>"Help me! Oh, Merlin, help me!" The voice screamed out, finishing with a strangled sob.</p><p>Lily stepped forward.</p><p>The wizard caught her arm, pulling her back.</p><p>"What-"</p><p>"We can't. We don't know if they're friend or foe. We need to get back to the tent," he said pragmatically.</p><p>Furious, Lily snarled, "They could be one of ours -"</p><p>"Or an enemy waiting for someone to come and then pick them off," snapped back the wizard. "We can't afford to get caught in that."</p><p>"There's two of us-"</p><p>"Barely," the man scoffed. "If I told you to run, I doubt you'd get very far."</p><p>Cheeks red, Lily wanted to retort, but a part of her, one that sounded like Petunia and Hermione, piped up: <em>he's not wrong. Be smart about this, Lils.</em></p><p>Tightly pressing her lips together, Lily glared at the mediwizard but looked in the direction they had been moving in before they heard the scream.</p><p>He nodded, and they continued.</p><p>As they stepped into the clearing, Lily's breath caught in her throat. An acrid smell hung thickly in the air, and the sight of a burnt corpse made her stomach churn. But she had no time to dwell on it—a manic-looking mediwitch standing over the charred remains twisted something in Lily's chest, a reminder of how close this war had brought them to ruin.</p><p><em>They could be one of ours</em>, echoed Petunia's voice in her head again, but now it felt distant, drowned out by the growing dread curling in her gut.</p><p>The mediwizard who had been with Lily the whole time crouched to inspect the scene. "Nothing we can do for them," he muttered, but his voice was hollow. His eyes shifted over to the edge of the clearing where there were faint scorch marks, a trail leading away from where they stood and around the partially collapsed tent. "But maybe—there's still someone alive."</p><p>Lily's heart pounded harder, her gaze snapping to where the wizard pointed. They followed the trail—her mind racing through half-formed thoughts of who it could be, friend or Death Eater, her brother-in-law or an enemy—until...</p><p>Severus.</p><p>Collapsed in a heap behind the debris of the tent, blood was already soaking through his robes and pooling beneath him. Lily's legs moved before her mind could catch up, stumbling forward as her hands reached out.</p><p>"Sev!" she cried out. "No, no, no—"</p><p>She slid to her knees beside him, unsteady with her belly, shaking. Her palms pressed against the slick warmth of his blood, and her heart plunged into despair as she realized how serious it mediwizard stepped back, pausing long enough to place a warm hand on her shoulder, squeezed once, and then he walked away to his next patient.</p><p>"C'mon, stay with me, Sev," she begged thickly, heart thundering in her chest with the realization that maybe – maybe this wasn't going to go the way she wanted. "Stay!"</p><p>"Sorry," he gurgled, eyes wide and locked on hers. His <em>s</em>'s began to slur as his voice dropped into something weak. "So sorry."</p><p>"I know, Sev, I know." Lily rapidly blinked to keep away the tears.</p><p>There was something fierce on Severus' face. "It was - you, it was - always you. <em>Always</em>."</p><p>She had to close her eyes. She turned her face, clutching his hand against her cheek as she felt it spasm once, twice, in her grip.</p><p>"Oh, Sev…" She whispered, opening her eyes to look at him, green locked on black. She was – soft, quiet, and held his gaze as he focused entirely on her, even as his breathing slowed – and finally, with two tears falling from the corner of his eyes and into his temples… he passed.</p><p>But Lily never said it back.</p><hr /><p>The three stood in checkmate for a few heartbeats.</p><p>Distantly, they heard the thud of a door thrown open; the shouts of their fellow Death Eaters in the manor being drawn from wherever they were to battle - shouts filled the hallways.</p><p>"They're here," Bellatrix breathed, her eyes wide, her smile feral. Her entire body pivoted away from Rabastan to face the library and the sound of battle. Without even glancing back, she dashed from the antechamber, eyes wild with excitement.</p><p>"Let them come! Let them try!" she screeched, her voice gleeful, and then was gone, leaving only Rabastan and Rodolphus in the room.</p><p>"Rod–" began Rabastan, voice pleading.</p><p>"You did this," Rodlophus snarled, bringing his own wand up to point at him.</p><p>Rabastan stared. His brother had never raised his wand at him before–"You don't understand – I <em>had </em>to–!"</p><p>Rodolphus's eyes were glacial when he replied, matching his voice. "So do I."</p><p>"What–"</p><p>Rodolphus's wand instantly rose and then Rabastan was sent flying backwards, through the open door and into the library, slamming against a couch and topping over the back and landing hard on the floor behind it.</p><p>He grunted in pain, woozily bringing a hand up to his head and feeling the stickiness of blood on his fingers. Stupefied, Rabastan withdrew his hand and stared at his fingers, covered in the dark red liquid.</p><p>"You… I'm <em>bleeding</em>," he stuttered, gobsmacked. He peered over the edge of the couch at the figure of his brother walking through the antechamber door. "You made me bleed. <em>You</em>, Rod."</p><p>There was a grim press of Rodolphus' mouth into a tight line. He didn't speak as he stepped forward, another blast of hot air and sizzling red racing toward Rabastan.</p><p>Rabastan tucked behind the couch again, but it exploded, feathers, fabric, and wood framing going in every direction. Rabastan scrambled on his knees toward a nearby end table to keep something between him and his brother.</p><p>"Why are you doing this?" he shouted, popping up with his own wand ready. "<em>We're family</em>!"</p><p>"You ceased to be such when you brought down the wards," replied Rodolphus coolly. "You're no brother of mine."</p><p>Rabastan physically stumbled back a few steps at the barb, mouth dropping open. He rapidly blinked, trying to keep tears at bay as his chest felt like a band was wrapped around it, squeezing tighter and tighter.</p><p>"Not family," he murmured in echo, disbelief still touching his tone.</p><p>"No," agreed Rodolphus, firmly. "Not family."</p><p>Rabastan sniffed, once, then twice, and said, mulishly, "You never were a good brother, anyway."</p><p>Something cracked against Rodolphus' cool facade, for a brief moment – pain flashed in his eyes as Rabastan's own barb landed and hit, painfully – but then any emotion disappeared behind that bold, granite-like mask his brother always wore around others.</p><p>They stood still, statues in the library like the Lestrange family busts they had collected over the centuries, then–</p><p>Rabastan threw himself sideways as a sickly yellow spell smashed into the table, sending a book flying and decaying into rot. He lobbied a bone-crusher spell back toward Rodolphus, which his brother countered with a strong <em>protego</em> shield; the spell made the sound of a deep, heavy gong as it hit and then bounced off, crashing into the ceiling and sending plaster to the floor.</p><p>There was no way to recognize or count the spells the two traded; dazzling colours of red, white, yellow, green, and purple flashed in the library. Spells ricocheted off the shelves, tearing apart books and sending loose pages to flutter around them</p><p>Wooden shelves collapsed and broke, breaking into smaller and smaller pieces as the two utilized their space and made projectiles, stakes and shields and battering rams all the same against each other.</p><p>At that point, Rabastan threw himself behind a partially collapsed shelf, giving himself some breathing space. His left wrist was cracked, bone visible when he threw his arm up to protect his face at one point during their fight.</p><p>He was breathing hard, panting.</p><p>Rabastan bit his lip, mentally weighing his options. A shout behind him made him gasp, and he spun on his heels, wand up–</p><p>But it was just the sound of battle behind him, through the closed library doors. Whoever was out there was involved in a battle like him. The only difference was he didn't know who was winning.</p><p>"You can't run," called Rodolphus, sounding clear of breath. He hadn't broken a sweat – but Rabastan had landed a few hits and his unruffled brother looked distinctly dishevelled, his hair mused, robes askew, and walking with a pronounced limp. "I know every nook and cranny of this house, Rabastan. Give up. I'll make it quick."</p><p><em>Better chances out there than in here,</em> he thought, glancing once more at the doors.</p><p>"I know the same hidden spots and hallways, Rodolphus!" he shouted back. "Don't flatter yourself that you'll come out on top."</p><p>"Don't be stupid," called back Rodolphus, his voice sounding closer. "I've lived here longer, boy."</p><p>Rabastan's mouth twisted into a grim, wry thing. "Yeah? Then why did you always lose when we played hide 'n seek?"</p><p>He then shot up from his hiding place – Rodolophus was barely fifteen feet from him, mouth moving to cast – Rabastan <em>spun</em> and shouted <em>"BOMBARDA!"</em> at the closed library doors and then <em>ran</em> as his life depended on it – and it did.</p><p>He dodged a spell and he dodged debris, and just as he threw himself forward, out of the room, instinct had him twist his head just so and a cutting curse sailed by, between a red-robed Auror and Death Eater, who both paused their fight in shock.</p><p>It still cut across Rabastan's forehead.</p><p>Blood trickled down from above his eyebrow and into his eye, forcing him to blink to clear his vision. A smear of that same blood went across his forehead and down his cheek, giving him a wild appearance.</p><p>Of course, that was when Sirius Black and James Potter saw him.</p><p>Black sent a Death Eater flying through the air, only to land, impaled, on a decorative set of antlers the Lestranges had lining the hall.</p><p>"What happened to you?" the elder Black brother demanded, wand in a tight, white-knuckled grip. All three ducked as a spell soared above them, hitting a stone wall and sending chips flying.</p><p>"My brother," gasped Rabastan, glancing back toward the library.</p><p>James glanced back in the same direction, a frown on his face. "I don't – Is Hermione here?"</p><p>"Probably," replied Rabastan. "They wanted me to lower the wards tonight, but Bellatrix and my brother came across me just as I was about to lower them. She came from the dungeons."</p><p>James' face went dark at the thought, and he shared a look with Sirius.</p><p>"We'll find them," said Sirius, clasping James on the shoulder.</p><p>Annoyed at being ignored, Rabastan sent them both a disgusted glance, ducking when a spell misfired and went careening off above their heads.</p><p>"Yes, well," he sniffed, "Perhaps you can do that sooner rather than later? As you can see–things are a bit <em>much</em> at the moment."</p><p>Sirius flashed Rabastan an almost nasty grin, whipping his wand to the side and, without looking, sent a Death Eater creeping up behind them off to the side. "Maybe a bit much for you, Little Lestrange."</p><p>He barred his teeth in return.</p><p>"We don't have time for this!" snapped James, turning to glare at both of them. A shuffle had the three turn to see Rodolphus emerge from the library's smashed doors, one barely hanging on by a hinge. He sent it off kilter, knocking it into the wall behind and then it fell to the floor.</p><p>Rodolophus locked eyes on his younger brother.</p><p>Once, the look would have sent Rabastan running. But Rodolphus was bleeding. His robes were rumpled. His hair was a mess, book and plaster mixed in with dirt and grime from their earlier scuffle.</p><p>He wasn't the same imposing brother he once had been in Rabastan's mind. And that thought, as it solidified in him, had the younger Lestrange slowly stand tall. Without taking his eyes off his brother, he directed, "Potter. Finish this."</p><p>And then he began walking forward, to Rodolphus. "This fight is mine."</p><p>"Good luck, Lestrange," he heard Black call from behind.</p><p>And while he felt confident, he knew he'd still need all the luck he could get to come out on top.</p><hr /><p>James and Sirius dodged, wove, and ducked their way through the grand entrance hall where they left Rabastan to face off against his brother, throwing themselves sideways through the first available door they found.</p><p>A started, half-masked Death Eater turned at the noise, wand rising. Sirius was already there, in front of James and snapping off a volley of spells that slammed hard into the wizard, sending him flipping through the air and crashing over a desk, scattering parchment and ink.</p><p>He didn't get back up on the other side.</p><p>James rounded the desk, yanking the mask off. The wizard beneath it was someone he didn't recognize, but that wasn't uncommon lately. Voldemort had been recruiting heavily from Continental Europe, and many of the Death Eaters he had fought against weren't British. It made finding them within their community all that much harder.</p><p>"Is he dead?" asked Sirius, almost nonchalantly. What a change from the wizard who wondered what James was becoming, several months ago.</p><p>"No, knocked out," he replied, sending another stunning spell at the man and then securing him with his Auror cuffs, the few Moody let them carry around.</p><p>"Just another grunt then," muttered Sirius. He groaned. "How many of those buggers are there?"</p><p>"Enough." James stood, turning his back on the wizard and casting a glance around the room. "This place is a maze."</p><p>"Most wizarding houses are," commented Sirius. "You know that."</p><p>"And it's working against us," groused James. "Are we supposed to go room by room?"</p><p>"Might be best." Sirius twirled his wand.</p><p>James pursed his lips. "It'll take forever."</p><p>Sirius eyed him, slowly lowering his wand. "Then you know what we have to do, Prongs."</p><p>"Split up," sighed James, not liking the idea at all. He licked his lips, a heavy frown tugging down on them. "I don't like it."</p><p>"Only option, mate. I know you've never liked it, but needs must. There's not enough of us—Order members, Aurors, anyone else they managed to call in," said Sirius quietly. "We don't even know if they're all on our side."</p><p>James grit his teeth in frustration.</p><p>"I'll check the basement. If Hermione's anywhere, she's there," offered Sirius. "And likely with my brother and Crouch, too. I'll find them."</p><p>"Then I'll push ahead and find the others," sighed James, his stomach churning with nerves. He itched to be the one to find Hermione—but he also knew that he might be a little more of a hindrance if that prophecy was in play, no matter how much she didn't believe in it. "Link with the with Order and help them take the ground floor."</p><p>"I'll find them," Sirius reiterated, emphasizing the words. He reached out and clasped James on the arm briefly. "Princess is a tough witch. And so's your sprog."</p><p>James tried to smile, but all he could push out was a tight nod. He had the sudden urge to tell Sirius to be careful, but Sirius already knew.</p><p>When he stepped back, Sirius flashed one last grin, all wild and reckless. He saluted James with his wand, once, and then ducked out of the room, into the fray just beyond their pocket of silence.</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>James sighed and then followed. He had a job to do, and the sooner he finished it, the sooner he'd find Hermione and they'd end this—once and for all.</p><hr /><p>The entrance hall eventually emptied of fighters. They were either dead, or unconscious, or fled at some point, between bouts of spellfire and debris being used as weapons.</p><p>Rodolophus didn't immediately start slinging spells. Instead, he coolly watched Rabastan with the same silver eyes they shared, sharp and assessing.</p><p>"It's not too late to fix this, Rabastan," Rodolophus finally said, his voice low and smooth. "Our Lord is not without mercy. Grovel, and he—"</p><p>"I won't bow to a half-blood lunatic." The words burst from Rabastan's mouth without realizing he had thought them, a deadly arrow that hit Rodolophus with enough force the wizard teetered on his step forward, blinking. Snarling, Rabastan continues, "You sold our family's soul to him! To a madman who cares nothing about <em>us</em>, our <em>values</em>—"</p><p>"I did what had to be done," snapped back Rodolophus, suddenly furious. "I did what we were raised to do."</p><p>Rabastan scoffed, swinging his arm to the side, wand blazing and letting sparkles and spits of fire fizzle from it. "You dragged me into this at thirteen, Rodolphus. You handed me a wand, and told me we were doing our duty." He spread his arms wide on either side of himself, cocking his chin up in defiance. "And look where we are now."</p><p>"You were meant to learn," offered Rodolophus, voice tight and vibrating with anger. "To be one of the youngest to rise to the inner ranks. I should have known you'd be too soft to understand."</p><p>"<em>Soft</em>?!" Rabastan strangled the hysterical laugh rising in him. "Is that what you call thinking for myself is? For finally seeing the truth behind those ugly masks you wear? Tell me, <em>brother</em>—when did you stop thinking?"</p><p>There was a brief, poignant silence that lingered between them. Then Rodolophus murmured, "When I realized there's no place for weakness in this war."</p><p>Rabastan sucked in a sharp breath, pain cracking in his chest where his heart sat. "I see. Then… between the two of us, Lestrange…" There were tears in his eyes, but he blinked them away. "You're the traitorous bastard."</p><p>Fury washed across Rodolophus's face and then they were pointing their wands at each other, spells firing at near-impossible rates. Rodolophus cast silently, Rabastan barely so; the cut on his forehead still bled, sluggishly, down his brow and into his eyes and he found himself faltering, on the back step.</p><p>But his brother didn't let up. He cast spell after spell, disintegrating the wooden chest against the stone wall, liquifying a plant in another corner, and blasting apart the tapestries or ripping apart metal doors, twisting them into spikes and spears to launch at him.</p><p>Rabastan kept moving backwards, letting memory guide him instead of looking. He sent whatever he could toward his brother, banishing item after item, flinging bits and pieces—vases, pots, even one screaming portrait—to intercept any spell that was coming his way.</p><p>It took one moment of distraction to get him, though.</p><p>Rodolophus managed an almost-gentle <em>flippindo</em> on him, sending Rabastan flying head over heels backwards and through the conservatory doors, shattering the glass.</p><p>He gasped, feeling the glass embedded in his back and digging into his robes, even as he scrambled to get upright, to keep a hold of his wand in his grip—</p><p>"<em>Expelliarmus,</em>" muttered Rodolophus and in horror, Rabastan watched his trusted wand wrench from his grasp and land smartly in his brother's outstretched grip. "And now what will you do, Rabastan?"</p><p>Rabastan gasped, breathing heavily and slipping on the tangle of his robes beneath him. Fear rose in him as Rodolophus stepped closer, his boots crunching on the broken glass from the door.</p><p>He focused his eyes on those boots. They were so familiar; Rabastan gifted them to Rodolophus for Yule. <em>What a thing to think about</em>, he thought, trying to concentrate on his body, trying to stand and slipping in blood and glass.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>"What's this?" a sibilant voice hissed, halting Rodolophus's steps immediately.</p><p>"My Lord," greeted the elder Lestrange. Rabastan turned his head, cheek pressed to the floor and smearing blood as his eyes travelled from his brother's boots, up his robe, and to the creature that glided into the room, sycophants hovering behind him.</p><p><em>Voldemort</em>, thought Rabastan blearily. <em>Great</em>.</p><p>"Wittle 'Bastian is the reason why the wards are down, My Lord," simpered Bellatrix, her voice grating to Rabastan's ears. "He's a little traitor who invited Dumbledore's men in."</p><p>Others in the room grumbled, annoyed voices layering until they were a low rumble.</p><p>Voldemort was barefoot, calmly stepping over the glass of the conservatory like the shards were inconsequential to him. The wizard stopped just inches from Rabastan, and then slowly knelt down, catching the younger wizard's eyes.</p><p>There were hints of the man he used to be, but the inhuman in him was all that starker: the thin, bloodless lips, the unnatural paleness to his pallor, and the unnatural way he moved, a little too smooth, too flowing, to be all that human anymore.</p><p>Those same bloodless lips curled into a predatory smile. "What a disappointment you are, young Lestrange. What shall we do with you?"</p><p>Moaning, Rabastan tried to get a hand under him, to push up. It slipped. He tried again, got one knee under him when Voldemort's bare foot connected with his shoulder and <em>pushed</em>, sending him back to the floor, gasping in pain as the shards in his back began to burn.</p><p>"Tsk. There's only one way to deal with traitors, boy."</p><p>"<em>No</em>," moaned Rabastan, glancing up. But his vision was fading, going grey at the corners. Voldemort raised his wand, that same smile on his face. <em>No! No, please. I don't want to die.</em></p><p>The room went quiet in anticipation.</p><p>And then there was a loud creak, from the far corner. And from the corner of his eyes, just as everything pitched black, Rabastan saw Evans—<em>Hermione</em> and Crouch stumble from a hidden panel.</p><p>Voldemort pivoted immediately, his wand cutting off the curse that superheated the glass in the younger Lestrange's back, melting it. Instead, he turned, lips quirking up in a parody of a pleasant host smile.</p><p>"How kind of you to join us, Ms. Evans. Mr. Crouch. Welcome."</p><p><em>Oh,</em> Rabastan thought. <em>Well, that's good then</em>.</p><p>And then he succumbed.</p><hr /><p>Regulus dove into the storage room seconds behind Sirius, who whirled to cover his brother's back, wand blazing. Regulus exhaled sharply, ignoring the stitch in his side, and darted his eyes all over the room, looking for a way out.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was very like the room he, Hermione, and Barty had woken up in – windowless, filled with bags of grain and flour, some wooden boxes, and a few steamer trunks. Misshapen and mismatched jars filled with unidentifiable liquids lined wooden shelves along one far wall.</p><p>Sirius grunted, slamming the door shut and slinging every protection and ward spell he knew at it until the hinges and edges of the door along the frame glowed and pulsed.</p><p>Regulus eyed it. "How long will that hold?"</p><p>Sirius was leaning heavily against the wall just next to the door. He straightened when Regulus spoke, shuffling forward into the room and then toward the crates, knocking one of the tops off to clatter loudly on the stone floor. "A bit. I threw up some Black wards. Not too long, though, and even less if Bella is with them. There was nearly a dozen after us the last I saw."</p><p>"Shit," muttered Regulus, gnawing on his lower lip. "What do we do?"</p><p>"Prepare," answered Sirius, grimly, although his voice was muffled as he searched through the crate. "Oh! And get sloshed, ha!"</p><p>He triumphantly held up a dusty bottle of Odgen's.</p><p>Regulus glared. "Now is <em>not</em> the time—"</p><p>"Now is <em>precisely</em> the time, little brother," countered Sirius with an easy, loose grin. He pulled the cork out with his teeth, listing a bit to the side as he brought the neck up to take a swig.</p><p>"You don't think we're getting out of this alive," said Regulus quietly, eyeing his brother.</p><p>Sirius startled. "Were we supposed to?"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Well, I suppose you'd know," began Sirius hesitantly, eyeing Regulus carefully. "With your best friend being a time traveller and all."</p><p>Regulus sputtered, eyes bulging. "I-I beg your pardon?!"</p><p>"Hermione," said Sirius, eyeing Regulus, his voice slow and hesitant as he tried to suss out if he had inadvertently stepped into something he shouldn't have. "You knew, right? I could have sworn you and Crouch knew—"</p><p>"But how did <em>you</em> know?!"</p><p>The look Sirius gave his brother was one of great disappointment. "Reg. One; Marauder. Two; I'm a Black. Three; you're hardly subtle."</p><p>"I can be subtle," groused Regulus, crossing his arms.</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes, drinking from the bottle.</p><p>"No, really!"</p><p>"I'm sure you believe so," condescended Sirius, eyebrows raised. He exhaled sharply.</p><p>Regulus muttered under his breath for a bit, feeling insulted, with his arms crossed. He kept his back to Sirius, and eventually his muttering tapered off after a few minutes of broodiness.</p><p>Behind him, he could hear the spellfire from the Death Eaters trying to enter the room, but it was muffled – for now. They needed to find a way out. There weren't too many options – it was a dead-end room without any windows and a single door as an entryway, and that was not an option for them right now.</p><p>"Maybe I can make a tunnel…" said Regulus lowly, leaning against the stone foundation and tracing the thick, chalky grout between the stones. "Like what Hermione did…"</p><p>Sirius grunted, glancing at the barricaded door; the bright silvery glow that traced the frame and edges was flickering as dull thuds and creaks vibrated the wood – whatever spells the Death Eaters were using on the other side were meant to <em>damage</em>. "Best do it soon, Reg. That door isn't going to hold much longer. They're throwing everything they've got at it."</p><p>"Okay," agreed Regulus, taking a deep breath, and releasing it. "I've watched her do it several times. I know the theory. I can do it." He nodded, once, twice. He began pulling on his magic, sending it to his hand and wand, like was building for a large-scale spell. "We're going to get out of here, Sirius. We're going to be fine."</p><p>Behind him, Sirius huffed a tiny laugh. "Yeah, I don't think so."</p><p>Frowning, and a little miffed at the jab at his skills, Regulus turned. "What do you mean—"</p><p>"I'm not going to make it, Reggie." There was something resigned on Sirius' face as he slowly sat on one of the crates they left closed. He let the half-empty bottle of Odgen's slide from his hand and clatter to the floor.</p><p>Regulus stared. "Don't say that, of course you will. You've got that famed Sirius Black luck on your side, don't you? That Gryffindor recklessness and ability to throw yourself into danger and make it out on the other side perfectly fine."</p><p>Sirius laughed, a bit raspy and rough, and bitter. "Nah, not this time."</p><p>Regulus paused, sensing something in Sirius's voice, and then asked quietly, "What do you mean?"</p><p>His older brother looked up from his place on the crate, and slowly pulled his leather jacket back, revealing his left side. It glistened in the low light of the storage room, and when Sirius pulled his band t-shirt up, Regulus saw the ragged cut, still sluggishly bleeding, and the dark veins that spread from it, disappearing underneath the fabric.</p><p>Sirius' teeth gleamed in the dark, in a parody of a smile. "One of those bastards was luckier than me, Reg."</p><p>Regulus stared at the wound, his mouth open. "Sirius…"</p><p>"Well?" said Sirius, nodding at the wall Regulus had been examining a minute earlier. "Get on with it, Reggie. Get out of here."</p><p>"Not without you," he retorted quickly, shaking his head. They both ignored the pounding against the warded door, growing louder as the wards began to fail. The glow around the door flickered, brightening, and then dimming, with each whack of spellfire that hit it.</p><p>"You planning on hauling my corpse?" asked Sirius with a raised eyebrow. He snorted. "That's morbid, even for a Black. C'mon, Reg."</p><p>Exasperated, Regulus cried, "Merlin, you're such a dick, Sirius! Can't you take this—"</p><p>"Siriusly?" Sirius stared for a moment and then burst into laughter; his hand pressed against his side. "Oh mate, you walked into that one!"</p><p>When his laughs tapered out, Sirius levelled a rather sober look on his brother. "Do better, Reggie. Make the Black name something to remember positively, for change, for the future instead of what our family has made it. You were always the best of us."</p><p>Regulus choked. "Siri—"</p><p>"I know, Reg. It'll be okay," he replied with a tight smile that was more of a grimace. "Tell James it was my choice, okay? <em>My</em> choice. And… and tell Crouch that I'm sorry I was such a cunt in school. It wasn't – it wasn't about him."</p><p>Blinking back tears, Regulus spoke thickly, "They know, Sirius."</p><p>"And Princess – <em>Hermione</em> – she better raise that godson of mine right, you hear?" continued Sirius, breathing heavily, quickly, like he wanted to get all his thoughts out at once. "You make sure of it. Kid's gonna need some levity in his life, between her, you, Crouch, and Moony, eh? James is outnumbered."</p><p>"I'll take him to Zonko's every chance I get," promised Regulus, the tears welling in his eyes. His throat was tight, and he tried clearing it without success. "I'll do you proud, Sirius."</p><p>Sirius' look was fond. "You always have, Reg."</p><p>Regulus bit back a sob, turning away from Sirius to face the outer wall. Behind him, he could make out a few muffled shouts from the Death Eaters outside the storage room; the wards were nearly broken.</p><p>He swallowed the lump in his throat and held his wand aloft, squaring his shoulders and thinking back to what Hermione did – the intent – and visualized what he wanted. He murmured under his breath and then traced his wand in the air.</p><p>The rocks cracked along the grout and then collapsed in on themselves, shaking the walls and letting dust fly. There were groans as the magic rearranged the structural wall, and as the stone fell back, the tunnel appeared.</p><p>Once it was large enough, Regulus dropped his wand. He partially turned, looking over his shoulder at Sirius. "Love you."</p><p>Sirius smiled at him – wide and bright, reminiscent of the Marauder and brother Regulus knew, a wizard in his prime and not one facing down the execution's axe. "Love you too, little brat. You were always my favourite."</p><p>Wetly, Regulus laughed. "Give them hell, Sirius."</p><p>Sirius' face was dark with promise when he answered readily, "I plan on it."</p><p>Regulus gave one last nod. He roughly wiped at his wet cheeks with a huff, pushing past the pain in his chest when he stepped into the darkness of the tunnel. It gently sloped up – out of the basement dungeon of the Lestrange house – and began to steadily walk, refusing to stop, refusing to look back.</p><p>Sirius watched him go and waited a few more moments so that Regulus had travelled far enough down the tunnel he made before slowly easing up from the crate and turning to face the barricaded door.</p><p>The glow around the edges was dull, having faded under the barrage on the other side.</p><p>Sirius stood, staggering a little as he did so, wheeling around to face the door. He held his wand aloft, loose in his grip. The spell he wanted was on the tip of his tongue, at the forefront of his mind and his wand – dogwood and dragon's tail – practically vibrated as it resonated, syncing with his magic and intent.</p><p>The spells against the door stopped; he looked up and saw that the glow around the edges of the frame had disappeared. It was just a regular wooden door, once more, he realized with a thick bob of his throat.</p><p><em>Protego</em>, he thought, just as the door exploded inward, sharp pieces flying toward him and bouncing off his shield. The wood pinged against the invisible barrier, and then loudly clattered all over the storage room.</p><p>One, then two, then four, then more Death Eaters than Sirius could count, stepped into the room. <em>Merlin, how many assholes does this Dark Lord have?</em></p><p>"Give it up, Black," said one, a low, growly voice that made him sound like a werewolf. "Give yourself up and our Lord will spare your life."</p><p>Sirius laughed, a bit hysterically. "Oh, will he?"</p><p>The Death Eater remained silent. He wasn't going to spare Sirius, not anymore, despite being of Black blood. They all knew that.</p><p>He took a deep breath, eyes fluttering shut as he drew upon his favourite memories –</p><p>"See you all in Hell, fuckwads," said Sirius, opening his eyes and bringing his wand down with a sharp slashing movement. Fire burst from his wand, crackling boiling hot as flames not only burned all the wood in the room, but the resulting firebomb burst forward and out into the hallway beyond, seeking air as it grew in size and heat.</p><p>– <em>Meeting James for the first time on the train, the Potters telling him he was welcome to stay with them, and Remus and Peter and Lily and Marlene and the feel of flying on his motorbike; Hermione helping him reconnect with Regulus, Regulus, Regulus</em> –</p><hr /><p>He had only taken a hundred paces or so, maybe halfway down the tunnel he made, when the tunnel shuddered, groaning and creaking around him. Regulus threw out a hand, trying to hold himself up against the wall and on his feet. Debris rained down around him, dust and bits of rock and earth.</p><p>He tightly squeezed his eyes, gasping for breath. He brought a hand up to his chest, twisting his fingers into the fabric of his shirt. It felt like a part of him – a blinding, vibrant light – flickered and then was snuffed out.</p><p>He knew what that meant.</p><p>He stifled the cry that wanted to emerge from his throat, squeezing his eyes tight against the tears that wanted to spill. Instead, he took a solid moment to compose himself, with deep breaths.</p><p>He opened his eyes, stared fiercely straight into the darkness of the tunnel ahead of him, and swore, "I'll make you proud, Sirius. I <em>promise</em>."</p><hr /><p align="center">TBC…</p>
